00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,422
The power released
as the Red Dragon Emperor,

164
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,633
along with the Evil Piece
inside you,

165
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,761
allows you to promote
yourself without a King.

166
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,472
Yeah, but it's
a huge ass power drain.

167
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,224
At this rate, I'll only be able

168
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,893
to maintain the armor
a little bit longer.

169
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,186
[gasps]

170
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,980
Well, you certainly
pulled that trick

171
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,316
out of your hat
at the last minute.

172
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,610
I probably would have died
if it weren't for this spear.

173
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:14,781
However, that little stunt
looked like an Illegal Move.

174
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,241
[ISSEI laughs]
Just like your mom.

175
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,951
Yes, that's very mature.

176
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,745
Actually, it's a well‐known
chess term.

177
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,206
An Illegal Move means
an unacceptable play,

178
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,791
and I say that
because all of your attacks

179
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,127
deviate from
the Evil Piece system.

180
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,963
[DDRAIG] I personally felt
like it was more of a Triaina.

181
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,965
[ISSEI]
Whatty what now?

182
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,092
[DDRAIG] Triaina.
It's the three‐pronged trident

183
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,469
that was used
by the Greek god Poseidon.

184
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,429
The transformations
you just used

185
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,640
also came in a set of threes

186
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,810
and displayed the same power
of the god's trident.

187
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,854
[ISSEI] Yeah, that sounds
pretty bitchin'.

188
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,605
From this day forward,
that play shall be known

189
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,691
as "Illegal Move Triaina"!

190
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,484
Congratulations.

191
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,528
However, it looks
like you're low on juice.

192
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,489
[ISSEI]
What a tool.

193
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,825
Last time
we caught him off‐guard,

194
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,327
but now the dude's
gonna be watching us.

195
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,246
What's wrong, Cao Cao?

196
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,415
Why don't you come open
this can of whoop ass?

197
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,877
Well, I would,
but there's not much to open.

198
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:13,631
Besides, it looks
like we're out of time.

199
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,721
[ISSEI gasps]
That's not good.

200
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,682
It seems our guest
has finally arrived.

201
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,642
Hey, Georg! Be a dear

202
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,895
and prepare to summon
the Dragon Eater.

203
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,229
[gasps]

204
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,232
Wait, this isn't right!

205
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:35,528
This chi. It's the
Mischievous Dragon, Yu‐Long!

206
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,324
[ISSEI] Yu‐Long? Isn't that
one of the five dragon kings?

207
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,247
[man]
Geronimo! Ho‐ho!

208
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,417
If it isn't the young
spear‐wielding whipper snapper!

209
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,960
[CAO CAO]
Oh, and if it isn't

210
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,338
the Great Victorious
Fighting Buddha.

211
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,798
Pray tell, to what
do I owe this pleasure?

212
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:00,428
Don't play dumb, you know why
I'm here you little shit‐stain.

213
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,513
This prank of yours
has gone too far,

214
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,933
and while some heroes
rise up to become deities,

215
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,684
others end up
becoming the poison

216
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,645
that gives everyone else
a bad name.

217
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,271
Did that answer your question

218
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,148
or should I use smaller words?

219
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,191
Well, sonny?

220
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,859
"Poison"? I see.

221
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,362
If you're the one
labeling me as poison,

222
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,739
then I think I'll
take that as a compliment.

223
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,075
Hm! Leave the rest to me.

224
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,410
I'm the first‐generation
Sun Wukong.

225
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,829
[ISSEI] Whoa! No shit?
That's super awesome!

226
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,790
Ya did real good, kiddo.

227
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,959
I'll handle things from here.

228
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,212
Yu‐long, take care
of the fox broad!

229
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,713
[YU‐LONG]
Got it.

230
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,633
Hey. Not to rain
on your parade,

231
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,427
but it looks like Vritra
beat us to the punch.

232
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,222
[SUN WUKONG] Not yet,
he hasn't. Go lend him a claw.

233
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,848
After this,
you can gorge yourself

234
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,142
with the best Kyoto
cuisine around.

235

[YU‐LONG]
No take backsies!

236
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,813
Ahh.

All right, all right, all right!

coming in hot!

239
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:01,030
Well, then, back
to these turd sandwiches.

with a clap of thunder

249
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,849
through the jaws of a dragon.

Well, would ya look at that?

00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,034
The dragons are
almost done over there.

Without that four‐eyes' spell,

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,954
the fox is running
on empty. Huh?

Oh dear.

You seem to have
given me a teensy prick,

but then again you know
all about those, don't you?

to reach that goocher!

00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,976
We're in your debt.
After your departure,

320
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,228
I have arranged to meet
with both the Great Victorious

321
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,398
Fighting Buddha Sun Wukong
and Lady Leviathan.

322
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,276
It is my sincerest wish
to cooperate with everyone,

323
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,195
so that Kyoto will
never again be in a situation

324
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,531
such as the one we found
ourselves in last night.

325
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,617
I'm right there with you.
We'll all do our best.

326
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,499
[giggles] The fox youkai have
offered to show me

327
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,669
around Kyoto a bit more before
we have our meeting later.

328
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,422
But I hope that the rest
of you have a safe trip back.

329
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,340
After all,
the trip doesn't end...

330
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:14,010
Until everyone's home.

331
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,720
[KUNOU]
Red Dragon Emperor!

332
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,638
You can just call me Issei.

333
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,558
Uh... okay, Issei.

334
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,603
Will you come and visit
us in Kyoto again?

335
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,730
Yeah. I'd love to.

336
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,773
I'm so excited!

337
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,192
And next time you can try
Mother's boiled tofu!

338
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,652
Yep!

339
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,949
[man on P. A.] Nozomi 24,
outbound to Tokyo, will soon

340
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,035
‐be departing the station.
‐Thanks for seeing us off!

341
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,079
‐Next time we'll bring everyone!
‐[KUNOU] Goodbye!

342
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,790
Thank you again for everything
you've done for us!

343
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,459
I won't forget it!

344
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,294
Promise me you'll
come back soon, okay!

345
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,713
Fo sho! See ya later, Kunou!

346
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,048
Stay outta trouble!

347
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,101
[gasps]

348
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,188
[chuckles]

349
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,068
Ah! Son of a bitch!

350
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,278
What? Is something
the matter, Issei?

351
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,072
I forgot to ask Yasaka
to show me

352
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,948
her foxy footballs
for saving her!

353
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,326
Oh, cruel world,
how could you do this to me?

354
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:23,037
Damn, that mofo's trippin'
like nobody's business!

355
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,789
Ya know, I bet it's
because we never

356
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,166
‐got to have our porno party!
‐[grumbles]

357
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,834
All right, fap‐masters,

358
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,628
sit down before I report you!

359
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,630
Gah, you're a bunch
of depraved dill‐holes.

360
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,178
You should have told us
what happened, Issei!

361
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,514
‐Uh, yeah.
‐And you said

362
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,015
that you were
going to contact us

363
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,767
after Kinkakuji,

364
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,852
but we never heard
back from you.

365
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,605
That's right.
Thanks for nothing, loser.

366
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,524
Well, what really matters

367
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,402
is that everyone
got home safe and sound.

368
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,612
[AZAZEL]
Plus, you can't blame the kid,

369
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,572
he had his hands full
with a new woman.

370
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,950
I guess you could
say she was a real fox.

371
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,536
Hey, shut it, Azazel!
And if that was supposed to be

372
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,746
a clever pun, it sucked balls!

373
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,874
Know what? I imagine
that the little fox princess

374
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,043
may very well inherit
her mother's good looks,

375
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,878
as well as few other assets.

376
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,381
What the eff, Azazel?
Gross, dude.

377
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,842
Besides, I prefer her mom's
ample motorboating material.

378
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,636
‐[punches]
‐[weakly] What'd I say?

379
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:21,971
You know, cockmuppet.

380
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,306
Besides, Issei finally managed

381
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,350
to unlock
his potential in Kyoto,

382
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,852
so cut him some slack.

383
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,981
Well, I suppose that's
a good development.

384
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,943
Then again,
he did poke my boobs.

385
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,946
About that! Sorry for summoning
you in your skivvies!

386
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,365
But thanks for letting me
jab your jawbreakers!

387
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,243
[sighs]
Anyway. Thanks to Issei

388
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,579
we had to follow up
on all the molesters.

389
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,332
But at least now the school
trip is finally over. [gags]

390
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,502
[AZAZEL] And next up
is the school festival.

391
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,671
By the way, I've got some news

392
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,798
about the daughter
of the Phoenix family.

393
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,050
She'll be transferring
to your school soon.

394
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,012
You mean Ravel? For real?

395
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,140
That's right. Apparently,
she was pretty impressed

396
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:09,268
by Rias and Sitri and decided
she wants to study in Japan.

397
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,936
She's a first‐year student,

398
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,646
kind of like Koneko, I believe.

399
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,523
She can suck it.

400
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:17,985
It feels kind of sudden,
though. Wonder why.

401
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,780
Well, things are rough
for everyone, y'know?

402
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,867
Moving along.
I'm happy nobody died

403
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,161
and that you all had
a good time in Kyoto,

404
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,538
but now we've got
the Rating Game

405
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,457
with Sairaorg to worry about.

406
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,209
There're still
a lot of preparations

407
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,127
‐that need to be made.
‐[GROUP] Right!

408
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:40,049
[ISSEI] Oh yeah.
The upcoming Rating Game.

409
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,385
I'll get to face off
against Sairaorg again.

410
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,430
And this time I'll win!

411
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:50,100
[grunting]

412
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,231
[SEIGVAIRA]
Sairaorg, have you heard?

413
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,025
‐Huh?
‐There's a rumor

414
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,610
that the Red Dragon Emperor

415
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,028
of the Gremory household
has obtained

416
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,488
a special new ability.

417
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,574
That sounds pretty interesting.

418
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,493
[SEIGVAIRA] They say that
he fought against the leader

419
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,662
of the Hero Faction,
against the possessor

420
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,414
of the True Longinus
and survived.

421
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,042
No surprise. After all,

422
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,253
dying would only break
his promise to me.

423
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:21,382
Right. Bring it on,
Issei Hyodo!

424
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,392
[ISSEI] We're preparing
for the school festival!
