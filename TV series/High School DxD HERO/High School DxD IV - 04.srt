A few days ago, Yasaka,

revered leader of the yokai,

to the meeting.

185
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,998
The yokai conducted
an investigation

186
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,458
regarding her disappearance,

187
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,501

Yasaka must have been kidnapped

188
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,086
by an unknown party.

189
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,172

to search all over Kyoto

[AZAZEL] Wait, are you
already drunk from just that?

478
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,408
[ROSSWEISSE slurring]
Listen, Azz‐face,

479
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,201
you don't know
true day drinkin'

480
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,327
until you've worked for Odin,

481
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,205
God of Ratty Beards
and chief abandoner!

[ROSSWEISSE crying]
Don't you understand,

484
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,793
I can't get a boyfriend
'cause I have

485
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,212
abandonment issues,
you fool!

486
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,880
[AZAZEL]
You guys get going!

487
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,550
I'm sensing that we're headed
for downward spiral here.

488
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,468
[ROSSWEISSE crying]
You can sense that?

489
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,389
Wow, deep down you're not such
a stupid head after all, huh?

490
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,850
Thanks. Crap.
That's on my tab.

491
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,601
‐Aw, yeah!

Barkeep, give me some more!

[MATSUDA]
Snaps,

494
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,817
Miss Rossweisse
can't hold her liquor.

495
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:35,943
[MOTOHAMA]
For reals, dog.

496
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,486
[KIRYUU]
Oh, here's a fun fact.

497
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:38,863
You shouldn't look behind you

498
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,364
until you've completely
crossed over

499
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,615
the Togetsukyo Bridge.

500
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,242
[MATSUDA]
Who cares?

501
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,119
[KIRYUU] You should,
because if you look back

502
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,245
you lose any knowledge

503
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,997
you may have
previously received.

504
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,248
And since you didn't have

505
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,708
that much knowledge
to start with,

506
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,876
I'd hate to think about

507
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,586
what kind of state
that'd leave you in.

508
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,837
[MATSUDA/MOTOHAMA]
Shut your face!

509
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,422
Here's another fun fact!

510
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,132
If a couple happens
to look back,

511
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,509
then their relationship
is doomed to fail.

512
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,803
I'll never look back, Issei.
I'll never look back!

513
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:04,889

[ISSEI]
What is this?

516
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,397
Why is this fog so familiar?

517
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,649
[KIBA]
Dimension Lost!

518
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,651
The power of a Longinus.

519
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,070
Azazel has
mentioned it before.

520
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,782
[AZAZEL]
Kids! Are you all right?

521
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,870
I don't see anyone
else in the area.

522
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,663
It looks as though
everyone but us

523
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,956
has disappeared somewhere.

524
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,584
If I had to take an
extremely educated guess,

525
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,212
I'd say we've been forced
into another dimensional space.

526
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,464
No way.

527
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,007
[ISSEI]
What's wrong, Kunou?

528
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,468
When we investigated
my mother's disappearance,

529
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,471
they reported the same fog
right before she went missing.

530
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,807
Eff. Bad news bears.
