1
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,681
[ISSEI] The president
and her mom have been acting

2
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,308
hella weird lately.

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,060
Not just them,
but everyone.

4
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,854
Like they're expecting
something from me.

5
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:23,148
It's either one of two things.

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,151
The first is that I've somehow
hurt the prez's feelings

7
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,862
without realizing it because
I'm a total dick nugget,

8
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:32,032
or it could be something else.

9
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:35,160
And if that's the case, then...

10
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,590
[ISSEI] There are three guys
in the Gremory household.

11
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,842
The prez has always cared
about her family,

12
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,552
but something's off.

13
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,763
Like, she obviously treats
me differently

14
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,806
than the other dude‐bros
in her service.

15
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,976
For starters, she really digs
the romance stuff

16
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,227
or whatever with me.

17
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,397
I mean, I don't think
girls typically offer

18
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,066
to ride you harder
than a carousel horse

19
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,568
if their feelings are just
indifferent, do they?

20
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,112
No, that only happens in porn...

21
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,156
and maybe
those harem animes.

22
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:39,117
So taking her recent actions
into consideration...

23
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,370
Could the president
have feelings for me?

24
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,622
Like for real?
There's no way.

25
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,625
She's the master of our house,
and I'm just her servant!

26
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,543
We're both devils, sure,
but at the very most

27
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,629
I'm only a pawn to her!
Literally!

28
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:55,801
But... what if she does love me?

29
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,887
And I'm in love with her, too.

30
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,972
Not just because
she's my master,

31
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,558
but also because I love her
as a woman.

32
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:08,522
After all this time, I've seen
so many sides of her.

33
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,526
Her brilliance. Her nobility.

34
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,737
Her beauty.

35
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,447
Her kindness.

36
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,741
Her bangin' bod.

37
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,368
Her stubborn temper.

38
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,038
Sometimes she's mature.

39
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,623
Sometimes childish.

40
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:31,086
'Cause of all that, I started
to crush on her pretty hardcore.

41
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,757
She really is the ideal woman.

42
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,176
I'd love to kick things up
a notch and actually date her,

43
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,470
but is that even possible?

44
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,390
I wanna tell her how I feel,
but I'm scared.

45
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,601
I guess the real question is,

46
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,937
does the prez
actually like me back?

47
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,773
What if I ask and I'm wrong?

48
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:52,858
It'll ruin everything.

49
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,736
I don't want things
to change.

50
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,696
Damn, so what do I do?

51
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:01,324
This blows. Why do women have
to be so complicated?

52
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,077
[AKENO laughs]
You don't know how you feel,

53
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,954
and you're calling
us complicated?

54
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,831
[gasps]

55
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:11,209
[yelps, screams]

56
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,004
Oh! Ouch, my pride.

57
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,131
Uh, did you hear me?

58
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,593
‐Obvi.
‐[nervous chuckle]

59
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,346
Yeah, well.
Looks like I suck at thinking

60
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,182
about the president's
feelings, huh?

61
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,309
[ANEKO]
Yes, you've sucked very hard.

62
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,895
But to be honest,
you haven't been thinking

63
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,397
about the feelings of any women
in the Gremory family,

64
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,400
including Asia,
Koneko and myself.

65
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,320
[sighs]
Then again...

66
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,489
we're just as guilty because
we haven't been trying

67
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,657
to understand what
you're going through.

68
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,869
Uh, what I'm going through?

69
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,290
Now it's your turn.

70
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,585
Uh. Uh, see ya later, jacket.

71
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,545
Here's the thing.

72
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:58,548
See, I know Rias
is very important to you,

73
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,092
but if you're ever going to be
able to understand her

74
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,678
and what she needs,
you'll need to be healed first.

75
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,099
[chuckles]

76
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,477
We're going to suck out the
power of your dragon right here.

77
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,020
[yelps]

78
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,526
Don't just stare,
hold me already.

79
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,528
Huh? Uh...

80
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,279
I said hold me, Brainiac.

81
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,075
I'm going to perform healing
sage arts like I've done before.

82
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,160
[ISSEI]
Oh! If you feel anything move,

83
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:30,455
‐it's a compliment!
‐[KONEKO] Okay. Here goes.

84
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,625
[ISSEI moans]
You're gonna suck my finger off.

85
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,587
[gasps]

86
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:38,964
[energy humming]

87
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,716
[giggles]
I shall heal you as well.

88
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:42,968
Okay.

89
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,097
[Aneko sighs, giggles]

90
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,267
Sometimes, you seem scared
when you look at us,

91
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,727
and we could never
quite figure out why,

92
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,230
but now we finally understand.

93
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:58,567
Yes, except only the people who
were actually there that day

94
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,318
would be able to put
two and two together.

95
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,737
Please tell us
the truth, Issei.

96
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,116
You're still hurting over
Raynare's betrayal, aren't you?

97
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,827
‐[gasps]
‐Would you die for me?

98
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,537
[laughs]

99
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,498
Don't worry. That date was
everything I could want.

100
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,542
I was so bored,
I couldn't wait to kill you.

101
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,752
I love a man who takes control!

102
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,504
Where was this
when we were dating, huh?

103
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,964
[grunts]

104
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,509
Please, Issei, I need your help.

105
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,888
You'd never actually let those
devils hurt me, would you?

106
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,264
And I love you.

107
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,600
So won't you help me
defeat these scary devils?

108
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,436
If we do that, then you
and I can be together forever.

109
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,564
She was
my very first girlfriend,

110
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:40,775
and she just killed me,

111
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,319
and she killed Asia.

112
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,406
She lied to me,
she used me,

113
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:52,203
And in the end I‐‐
I truly hated that bitch, and...

114
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,289
[sobbing]

115
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,665
I'm actually afraid

116
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:58,209
of something like that
happening again.

117
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,629
[crying]

118
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,256
It's hard,
'cause I love gozangas,

119
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,842
but they remind me of her!

120
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,261
‐[crying]
‐It's okay, Issei,

121
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,513
because I love you so much.

122
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,557
I want to be
with you forever.

123
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,392
[ISSEI]
Asia.

124
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,187
I admire you,
and yearn for you.

125
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,606
You're the most
dependable guy that I know.

126
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,567
I truly mean it when I say
I want to be with you forever.

127
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,611
I can't imagine life
without you in it.

128
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,282
I wouldn't worry too much
about Rias, because I think

129
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,618
it'd be impossible
for her to really hate you.

130
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,579
After all, you always fight
harder and more passionately

131
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,331
for her than anyone else.

132
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,125
All of us in the Gremory family
are able to see that.

133
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,253
Regardless of what
the future may hold,

134
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,756
I really do believe
you can overcome this.

135
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,716
You're a strong person,
you just have to believe

136
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,093
in yourself a little more.

137
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,971
[crying]

138
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,975
‐[chuckles]
‐[gasps]

139
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,852
Exactly. Don't forget how many
of us love you, Issei.

140
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,647
Ditto. It's past time
to put the memory

141
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,066
of that fallen angel slut
into the "Fuck it" bucket.

142
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,610
‐Such a lady.
‐Koneko's right, though.

143
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,113
So, from now on,
the only Fallen Angel

144
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,198
you need haunting
your memories is me.

145
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,867
We've got your back,
so try to be more confident.

146
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,744
Hard to argue with that logic.

147
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,497
The point is, we all want
to be closer to you

148
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,541
and lend our support
as much as we can.

149
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,334
You do?

150
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,170
Of course, silly.
That includes Rias, Xenovia,

151
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,381
Irina, Rossweisse, Kiba, Gasper,

152
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,425
and everyone else
in the Gremory family.

153
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,801
We all love you so much,

154
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,262
and we want you
to succeed and be happy.

155
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,681
I wish you could see
the wonderful things we see

156
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,350
when we look at you.
You'll just have to trust us.

157
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,645
[chuckles]

158
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,230
You're right, yeah.

159
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,190
You guys have

Tonight we'll be utilizing
a popular variant item.

365
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,002
Behold,
a Dice Figure Game!

366
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:09,630
At this time I'd like to invite
the Kings from each team

367
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,675
to step up to the special
platform, please.

368
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,011
For those not familiar
with the dice game,

369
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,929
I will take this moment
to go over the rules

370
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,431
of how this will work.

371
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:22,184
For each round, the Kings
will use a normal six‐sided die.

372
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,729
Both Kings will then roll
their individual die

373
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,439
and the resulting total
of both numbers

374
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,524
will decide the members
of the match.

375
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,902
For example, if the numbers
rolled are equal to eight,

376
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,487
each team may
send out members

377
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,781
that add up
to that specific number.

378
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,617
The value
of each player depends

379
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,578
on what sort of evil piece
they consist of.

380
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,330
Pawns are one point,

381
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,248
knights and bishops
are three points,

382
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,833
rooks are five points,

383
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,585
and queens are equal
to nine points.

384
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,546
Multiple players may
be chosen for the match,

385
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,173
so in the case
of eight points,

386
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,883
the King may send out
two knights to participate,

387
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,968
or it's also
considered acceptable

388
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,678
to mix and match
your evil pieces,

389
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,222
so you could also send out
a three‐point knight

390
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,016
and a five‐point rook to fight.

391
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,852
The number of evil pieces
used for a family member

392
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,979
is also taken into account
for calculating

393
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,564
who to send into battle.

394
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,608
For instance,
Issei Hyodo is made up

395
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,985
of eight pawn pieces,
so he has a point value

396
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,987
equal to the number eight.

397
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,822
But remember,
ladies and gentlemen,

398
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,158
you cannot send out
the same piece consecutively,

399
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,951
so choose carefully.
And of course,

400
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,412
let's not forget
about the Kings of each family.

401
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,956
Like normal, the game will end
if the King is defeated,

402
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,042
and so, after taking
all of the above factors

403
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,544
into consideration,
the review board has decided

404
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:34,090
what the point value will be
for each the two Kings.

405
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,175
All right, my dears,
hold onto your hats,

406
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,553
because we are about to
announce those numbers!

407
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,807
Sairaorg Bael
will be worth 12 points!

408
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,601
Rias Gremory
will be worth eight points!

409
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:49,146
Now, now, Lord Sairaorg may
have a higher point value,

410
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,524
but that also means
he cannot participate in a match

411
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,317
without a maximum
roll of 12,

412
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,778
so that could work
to Rias Gremory's advantage!

413
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,614
The last rule is regarding
Phoenix Tears!

414
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:01,242

each team will have

The total is three.

430
