Are you seeing this right now?

43
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,615
And here I'd thought
that Rossweisse

44
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,075
had already been retired!

45
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,618
That was a smoke screen.

46
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,538
The Rossweisse that Sairaorg
defeated earlier was created

47
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,540
‐through Excalibur Mimic.
‐Huh?

48
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,543
[RIAS] What we're looking at now
is the real Rossweisse.

49
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,337
You'll notice that she's holding
Excalibur Transparency,

50
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,798
which has the ability
to make its wielder invisible.

51
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,427
Talk about a hella cool sword.

52
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:24,806
Yes. When Ex‐Durandal was
modified, Excalibur fragments

53
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,434
were incorporated
into the newly formed weapon.

54
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,187
So Rossweisse borrowed
one of the Excaliburs

55
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,356
from Xenovia
and used it to her advantage.

56
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,108
The glowing we saw
when she fell into the water

57
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,902
was also part of her plan.

58
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,405
It was all a ruse to make it
look like she'd been retired.

There's something different
about the look in your eyes,

like there's
a new level of intensity.

about going head to head

That's why...
we should drop this charade.

131
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,620
I think we should
ditch the rules

132
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,331
that would bar you
from fighting the next round.

we skip to the grand finale

You know, it's not a bad idea,

138

considering how predictable
the next few matches would be.

139
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,682
A player cannot participate
twice in a row,

140

would be Bael's Pawn

against Gremory's bishop,

between Lord Sairaorg

You make a good point.
An all‐out team battle

before we begin...

00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,445
I wanna say that I admire

173

how much your family
thinks of you.

174
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,199
Because of that,
they're very strong.

175
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,575

[NAUD]
Well, this is something new!

200
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,196
The Pawn of the Bael team
has transformed

201
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,823
‐into a giant golden lion!
‐[AZAZEL] It can't be.

202
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,950
‐The Lion of Nemea?
‐[NAUD] What's that?

203
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,702
Specifically, it was
the Lion that fought

204
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,871
against Heracles
in ancient mythology.

205
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,623
Not long
after the ferocious battle,

206
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,374
it was sealed
into a Sacred Gear,

207
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,377
and became one of the thirteen
legendary Longinus.

208
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,379
The weapon was rumored
to be strong enough

209
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,757
to crack the earth
with a single swing.

210
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,383
A battle axe
that could transform

211
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,094
into a giant lion,
Regulus Nemea!

212
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,971
What's odd is
that I'd heard its master

213
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,182
had been MIA
for quite some time.

214
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,391
That's correct.

215
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,018
His master was murdered.

216
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,687
When I found him, it was clear
there'd been a struggle.

217
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,689
The group that attacked him
was still there.

218
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,275
But the battle axe
had turned into a lion

219
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,152
and destroyed
every last one of 'em.

220
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:19,030
That's when I decided
to make him part of my family.

221
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,157
How's that for a backstory?

222
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,117
So, it's an intelligent
Longinus

223
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,161
that can move
without a master?

224
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,829
Now that's what I call
interesting.

225
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,915
Since he's a member
of my family

226
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,542
and has no master,
his power is rather unstable...

227
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,255
which is why he can only fight
in matches with me.

228
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,965
That explains
why you never sent out

229
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,466
your pawn until the end.

230

of the giant pussy!

it seems slower, too.

Resentment, pain, hatred.

The Grabbin' Dragon once told me

333
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,928
that boys shouldn't ever
throw a fit or cry!

334
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,431
He's taught me that even
if we fall down,

335
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,057
we have to keep getting back up

336
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,892
so we can protect
the ones we love!

That random boy is right!

338
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,980
The Grabbin' Dragon
has always stood up

339
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,273
and defeated all of his enemies,

340
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,150
even if the odds
weren't in his favor!

341
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,402
So, we have to cheer him on,

00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:35,114
because the Grabbin' Dragon,
is the best hero ever!

feel about him?

00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,708
for falling face first
into boobs,
