1
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,183
[sighs]

2
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:18,519
So, I definitely think
that Bishop form is gonna be

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,396
the biggest beeyatch
of the whole Triaina combo.

4
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,815
Probably. Unlike the Knight
and the Rook,

5
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,735
the Bishop form needs additional
time to charge the blast.

6
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:29,196
[ISSEI]
Yeah, and it'd be hella obvious

7
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:30,739
if we just stood there
the whole time.

8
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,242
[grunts, shouts]

9
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:39,665
It sounds kind of corny,
but we could use teamwork.

10
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,084
Yeah, fo sho.
If the team buys me time,

11
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,460
I could get a better shot.

12
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,003
Then I won't have to worry about
all that bobbing

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,506
and weaving crap
while I charge up the attack.

14
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,133
Sucks the Triaina saps energy

15
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,427
faster than streaming porn
off of WiFi.

16
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,429
I'll be lucky to get
a couple of shots in

17
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,014
before I've blown my whole load.

18
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,266
[KIBA]
If we're gonna use it,

19
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,684
it'd be best to save it
for Sairaorg.

20
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,435
[ISSEI]
Yeah. Sho â€˜nuff.

21
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,657
[explosion]

22
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,078
[XENOVIA]
Oops, my bad!

23
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,246
[ROSSWEISSE] Let's take
a quick break for right now.

24
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,873
[XENOVIA]
All right, sounds good!

25
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,251
‐[groans]
‐Hey, are you okay?

26
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,796
‐Yeah.
‐Sorry, I couldn't help

27
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,131
‐but overhear your conversation.
‐Oh?

28
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,301
What you said about
the Bishop form in the Triaina.

29
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,261
It's only a suggestion...

30
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,056
but instead
of a full‐on cannon blast,

31
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,724
couldn't you just
transfer the shot?

32
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,393
Both:
That's a great idea!

33
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,936
That way

34
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,897
your team can give cover fire
in a more effective way.

35
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,650
If we can make it look like
a charge and boost our allies,

36
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,361
then we could take them
by surprise. It could work.

37
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,905
Not to mention it'll leave
our frenemies hanging

38
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,408
on whether the next cannon blast
is gonna be a transfer

39
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,283
or an attack!

40
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,743
[RIAS]
True,

41
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,287
but we may have some
trouble with the game rules.

42
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,373
‐We will?
‐It won't be a concern

43
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,500
as long as the match
is a team battle.

44
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,253
Sairaorg stated previously
that he would like to accept

45
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,005
all of our various powers
in a single fight.

46
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,758
The higher‐ups involved
have approved this request.

47
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,761
And because of those
particular concessions,

48
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,805
I believe they'll make
special rules for the match.

49
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:45,183
"Special rules," huh?
Like what?

50
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,686
To start. They intend
to hold the Rating Game

51
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,770
inside a floating city,

52
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,523
which is over in the domain
of Archduke Agares's family.

53
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,609
And, they're planning to invite
a rather large audience,

54
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,737
so that means they're probably
not expecting it

55
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,321
to be a very long battle.

56
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,283
The Rating Game is just
another form of entertainment,

57
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,786
so naturally, there will
be some catering to fans.

58
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,371
She's right about that.

59
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,665
In fact, the game's attracted
quite a bit of attention.

60
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,625
‐You're kinda famous.
‐Cool!

61
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,294
Sounds like it'll be fun.

62
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,296
Looks like we're gonna have
to train like nobody's business

63
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,631
‐so we can kick some "A"!
‐[chuckles]

64
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,800
So, anyway. Thank you.

65
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,927
That was actually
pretty solid advice.

66
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,139
Of course. I suppose
it's the least I could do.

67
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,725
Okay, guys!
Time to nut up or shut up!

68
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,435
Let's do this thing
and start training!

69
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,520
Sorry, but it's too late
for training today.

70
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:31,855
What?

71
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,857
We have a press conference
tomorrow.

72
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,318
We have to be careful
we don't overdo it.

73
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,195
After all, it's important
that we look good

74
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,237
for the cameras.

75
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,740
Wait, when you say cameras‐‐

76
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,242
Yes, silly,
you're going to be on TV.

77
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,787
Try not to do anything stupid.

78
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,763
Hey, Gasper.
Do you think you're gonna wear

79
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,890
your girl's uniform
to the press conference later?

80
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,767
Uh, maybe?

81
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,560
It'd be strange to wear
a boy's uniform

82
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,187
after all this time.

83
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,731
Still though, I don't think
it'll make me less nervous!

84
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,775
[whimpers, screams]

85
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,485
I don't wanna go anymore!

86
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,779
I can't stand the thought
of everyone looking at me

87
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,114
‐during the stupid conference!
‐[KIBA and ISSEI laugh]

88
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,158
Huh?

89
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,329
Uh, Koneko? Can I get up?

90
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,832
Sounds like something
you should ask a doctor.

91
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,501
Unless we're not talking about
your junk, then the answer's no.

92
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,420
You seem rather feisty lately.

93
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,256
It seems Ravel's interest
in Issei

94
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,132
has made you
even more possessive.

95
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,218
Whoa, say what?

96
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,762
"Cunt‐tucky" Fried Chicken's
in love with you.

97
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,931
Jeez, get a clue, Mr. Nice Guy.

98
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,476
Uh‐oh, looks like some kitty's
a little green with envy.

99
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,728
‐That's so cute.
‐[groans]

100
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,607
She's right.

101
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,987
I guess Issei really is
Mr. Nice Guy... to everyone.

102
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,488
[ISSEI]
Hmm?

103
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,535
‐Huh?
‐[STAFF] Pardon me.

104
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,621
We are ready for you now.

105
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,669
What's up! Good to see you!

106
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,630
‐It's been a hot minute.
‐[RIAS] Hello, Saji.

107
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,174
‐Hey, bro.
‐Yo, how's it hangin'?

108
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,968
To the left.
What are you doing here?

109
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,928
Come on,
you seriously don't know?

110
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,889
Guess that's not a big surprise.

111
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,473
We actually have a rating game

112
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,100
the same day that you guys do.

113
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,270
And yet, no one seems
to really know about it.

114
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,981
Then again, we poke
a lot less boobs in our game.

115
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,859
That's probs a factor.
Anyway we got a press meeting.

116
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,528
Really? Shit!
How have I not heard about it?

117
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,031
Oh, right.
Did I forget to mention that?

118
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,574
Well, it's certainly news to me

119
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:48,992
[SAJI laughs]
Don't sweat it.

120
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,202
We haven't gotten
that much attention, really.

121
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,413
But hey, sounds like
the whole Underworld's psyched

122
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,749
‐about your game.
‐[chuckles nervously]

123
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,835
Hey, Saji, let's go.

124
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,379
Okay. See you losers later!

125
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,590
Totally. Take names
and all that jazz.

126
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,467
Will do. Good luck out there.

127
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,139
[indistinct chattering]

128
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,850
[MODERATOR]
Thank you for waiting.

129
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:17,646
And now, we are proud to welcome
the Gremory Family.

130
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,272
[people gasp]

131
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,358
[cameras clicking]

132
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,405
All right.

133
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,616
Both families are present,
so let's begin.

134
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,994
First, allow me to welcome
the Kings of each family.

135
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,538
Now, each King
will have the chance to comment

136
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,831
on the upcoming match.

137
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,084
Sairaorg will go first,
followed by Rias,

138
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,294
so please reserve
any comments for afterward.

139
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,838
Lord Bael? Please, start.

140
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,549
Yes, thank you.
Well, then...

141
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,511
I guess I'm just really excited
for this battle to begin.

142
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,680
I intend to fight
the Gremory family

143
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,973
with all my strength.

144
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,766
That's it for me.

145
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,396
I'm so honored to be fighting
against the Bael family

146
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,439
and look forward
to an interesting match.

147
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,525
Although he is considered
top‐ranking

148
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,985
among the younger devils,

149
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,487
I have no intention of losing.

150
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,490
In fact, I plan to win.

151
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,077
Thank you very much, everyone.

152
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,663
Next up. We will open the floor

153
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,416
for questions from the press.
Who's first?

154
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,834
[FEMALE REPORTER]
I have a question

155
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,627
for the biggest rising star
in the Underworld,

156
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,088
the Grabbin' Dragon,
Issei Hyodo.

157
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,883
‐Uh, 'kay.
‐So, do you intend to poke

158
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,969
Princess Rias' breasts
during the Rating Game?

159
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,430
Uh‐‐ uh, well, I‐‐

160
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,640
[FEMALE REPORTER] If you were
to poke them, when would it be?

161
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,891
And what about the reports?

162
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,643
Many say that,
like your stage show,

163
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,813
you're only able to power up
when you poke her boobs.

164
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,773
[nervous laugh]

165
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,942
And is it true
you've used this crude technique

166
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,236
to overcome
other dangerous situations?

167
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,698
Uh, when you say it like that‐‐
you know, it's sucky, but‐

168
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,116
[FEMALE REPORTER]
"Sucky Butt"?

169
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,617
What kind of sick code name
is that

170
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,827
for the princess's breasts?

171
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,162
[reporters shouting]

172
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,789
I have a question.
Do you happen to suck

173
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,667
‐her boobs, butt, or both?
‐[gasps]

174
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,086
[ISSEI] Holy hell, I just had
the worst word vomit ever!

175
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,630
I was trying to say
it was "sucky but necessary,"

176
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,923
and they didn't let me finish!

177
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,967
Does that indicate
that you'll be sucking

178
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,594
on her breasts
in the middle of the match?

179
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,720
[FEMALE REPORTER]
If you power up

180
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,929
when you poke them,
what happens

181
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,556
when you suck
those puppies instead?

182
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,183
Do you get even stronger?

183
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,143
Like, could you destroy
the Underworld with that power?

184
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,561
Please, Princess,

185
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,813
would you care to comment
on this matter at all?

186
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,982
[whimpers]

187
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,193
‐Nope. No comment.
‐[giggles]

188
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,653
And what are your thoughts
on this, Sairaorg?

189
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,156
[ISSEI]
Oh snap. Don't ask her cousin!

190
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,116
[silence]

191
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,745
Hmm. I suspect if he
were to suck Rias' breasts,

192
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,331
then the Red Dragon Emperor
would become even stronger.

193
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,666
[reporters gasp, murmur]

194
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,962
[ISSEI] Bro! Why'd you have
to teabag my rep like that?

195
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,506
‐[cameras clicking]
‐[MAN] Wow.

196
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,761
[SAIRAORG laughs]

197
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:58,389
Well, that was... something.
Am I right?

198
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,226
Never a dull moment with you,
huh?

199
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,645
That's what I like about
fighting the Grabbin' Dragon.

200
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,481
Yes, well, no one was talking
about your boobs

201
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:07,816
on public television.

202
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,692
Uh. I'm sorry.

203
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,445
I swear, we're taking
this Rating Game hella serious.

204
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,155
And I don't doubt it.

205
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,616
Honestly, I was pretty impressed
by the whole thing.

206
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:20,411
This may sound crazy,
but it takes some serious balls

207
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,123
to talk like that in front
of so many people.

208
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,875
I like that I never know
what to expect from you.

209
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,795
The next time you and I meet
will be in the arena.

210
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,131
‐Bring it.
‐[humphs]

211
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,299
You sound determined.

212
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,594
Well, then see you
in the sky, Red Dragon.

213
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,141

[water running]

215
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,287
[ISSEI sighs] That conference
was a total clusterfuck.

216
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,789
[groans]
I wonder if there's any way

217
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,208
I could say I was possessed?

218
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,669
[gasps]

219
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,838
Issei. What a surprise.

‐[door closes]

221

[ISSEI, strained]
Yeah. Come here often?

222
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,469
Well, nothing to see here!
[nervous chuckle]

223
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:21,931
Oh, come on now.

224
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,267
‐Stay a bit longer, would you?
‐[yelps]

225
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,810
If you insist!

226
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,604
[gasps]

227
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,733
‐It's just the two of us.
‐Uhh...

228
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,067
What a rarity,

229
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,528
since you're usually
surrounded by people.

230
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:40,074
You know, this steamy setting
is kind of romantic.

231
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,619
What if you took all of me
right here and now?

232
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,748
I realize after all this time
my body may be old news.

233
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,375
Is it possible it doesn't
do it for you anymore?

234
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,044
[gulps] Nope!

235
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,712
That's definitely not the case.

236
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,964
Trust me, I'm pitching
a serious tent right now!

237
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,341
[RIAS]
Okay.

238
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,304
So, do something about it.

239
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,765
I want you to give in
to your urges.

240
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,516
[whimpers]

241
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,395
Issei. What am I to you?

242
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,231
How do you think of me?

243
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:14,651
Uh, you mean
like besides the club president?

244
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,782
I get it. Then I'll show you
what else I can be.

245
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,617
[whimpering]

00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,538
[gasps]

247
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,791
[ISSEI]
My brain, among other things,

248
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,459
feels like it's gonna explode!

249
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,504
[shudders] Oh my god,
it's finally happening!

250
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,131
I just got a one‐way ticket
to Pound Town!

251
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,051
Thanks, universe!
I'm gonna become a man!

252
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,763
Tonight, Issei.
I want all of you.

Wow, her milkshakes
are all up in my yard!

255
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,523
So much so, I can feel her
heart beating against my chest.

256
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,149
Note to self:

257
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,693
This is the new number‐one
moment for the ol' spank bank!

258
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,988
I am swapping spit
like a total champ right now.

259
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,074
I mean, who knew
watching so much porn

260
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,909
would make me
a badass in the sack?

‐[moans]
‐[ISSEI] I may not be a chef,

262
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,998
but I'm about to stuff me
this turkey!

263
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,209
Holy shit, my first time's
gonna be in a sauna,

264
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,963
which is so friggin' hot!
Literally and figuratively!

265
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,425
[both moan, pant]

266
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:27,140
Oh. You're amazing, President!

267
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,308
[gasps]

268
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,310
President?

269
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,396
We're about to make
passionate love,

270
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,232
and you want to call me...
a title?

271
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,194
I can't believe that.
How could you?

272
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,412
President? Are you okay?

273
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,331
‐Enough, Issei!
‐[gasps]

274
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:55,960
Huh?

275
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,932
[sighs]

276
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,980
What's up, Gasper? How're things
going between Koneko and Ravel?

277
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:16,898
Well....

278
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,191
Fine, except for the whole

279
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,817
"fighting like cats
and chickens" thing.

280
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,277
Sounds about right.

281
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,364
But even though she kinda
complains the whole time,

282
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,824
I've noticed that Koneko
still helps Ravel out,

283
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,993
and while she usually has
a comeback ready,

284
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,578
Ravel does at least seem willing
to listen

285
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,913
to Koneko's instructions.

286
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,456
If you ask me,

287
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,041
it sounds like we can
probably count that as a win.

288
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:39,212
[groans] Why do girls
always have to be so confusing?

289
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,755
To be fair,

290
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,757
jealousy can bring out the worst
in just about anyone.

291
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,260
That's why they can't help
butting heads like that.

292
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,553
Azazel?

293
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,223
Uh, I don't really get
what you mean.

294
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,599
[AZAZEL chuckles]

295
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,309
I wish I could be helpful
to Ravel

296
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,644
in the same way Koneko is,

297
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,687
but I can't even support
someone in battle.

298
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,939
I don't know where I'd start

299
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,440
if I had to help somebody
like that.

300
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,983
I'm the most useless
person ever.

301
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,485
[ISSEI]
Gasper.

302
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,154
Listen up, I'm about
to drop some knowledge on ya.

303
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:08,324
Rule number one for any boys
in the Gremory household:

304
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,868
A real man always protects
the ladies, got it?

305
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,329
‐Yeah.
‐Now repeat it back.

306
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,499
Oh, um, a real man
always protects the ladies.

307
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,210
Rule two:
A real man stands up tall

308
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,379
‐regardless of the situation!
‐Right.

309
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,132
A real man stands up tall
regardless of the situation!

310
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,550
Last one!

311
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,010
No matter what happens,
never, ever, give up!

312
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,513
No matter what happens,
don't give up, ever!

313
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,974
Good! You nailed it.

314
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,600
If you ever get scared
or unsure,

315
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,228
just remember you're a man
of the Gremory family.

316
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,982
I've got it now! Right!
I promise to do my best!

317
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,776
Sounds good in theory,
but let's see how it goes, yes?

318
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,319
Start with baby steps.

319
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,451
Uh... [sighs]

320
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,913
[AZAZEL] All right.
Let's get started, shall we?

321
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,415
[clears throat]

322
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,501
First up. I have
a bit of news for everybody.

323
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:03,504
As it turns out, I've been
appointed as your advisor

324
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,256
for the upcoming Rating Game
with Sairaorg.

325
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,759
Hold up. If you're our advisor,
does Sairaorg also have

326
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,344
some know‐it‐all
that's gonna do crap for him?

327
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,721
Of course.

328
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,515
He will have the emperor
to act as his advisor.

329
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,809
His name is Diehauser Belial.

330
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:20,313
Wait, as in the Rating Game
champion or whatever?

331
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,982
[KIBA]
Yes. He's quite accomplished.

332
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,902
He's the long‐standing champion
of the Rating Game

333
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,737
as well as the head
of the Belial clan.

334
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:31,532
Don't freak out.
You guys have me. Lucky ducks.

335
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,202
Now, on to the next order
of business.

336
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,329
[hums]

337
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,540
I trust you all had a chance
to memorize the data I gave you?

338
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,834
These are the members
of Sairaorg's family.

339
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,253
Like you, they're also
rare types of devils,

340
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,047
and they constantly train.

341
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,549
Well, if that's the case,
then the chances are pretty good

342
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,968
they'll be even more powerful
at the game than they are now.

343
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,803
Yes, I think
we can count on that.

344
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,139
But what about their pawns?

345
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,641
As I recall,

346
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,267
they've never appeared
in a recorded battle before.

347
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,936
Now that I think about it,

348
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,063
I don't remember seeing any
at the press conference, either.

349
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,397
That's correct.

350
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,816
And we have little to no
information on them.

351
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,276
Whoever they are,

352
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,862
it's likely they're Sairaorg's
hidden trump card.

353
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,325
Okay then. Moving on,

354
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,327
Rias is going
to go over our battle tactics

355
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,788
and countermeasures
for the match in detail.

356
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,040
Thank you.
Please look at the screen.

357
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,918
As you can see
from the above image,

358
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,588
Sairaorg's team has one queen,
as well as two rooks.

359
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,094
With that,
why don't we call it a day?

360
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,221
One more thing, though.

361
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,598
If you were to join
the professional league,

362
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,600
you'd definitely climb
the ranks.

363
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,311
You already have
enough power for success.

364
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,647
‐That's nothing to scoff at.
‐[grumbles]

365
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:48,859
So, be proud, and take this
challenge on with confidence.

366
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,695
[GROUP]
Yes, sir!

367
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,532
[XENOVIA]
Hey, Asia, is this right?

368
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,200
[GASPER] It's so cute!
Don't you think so?

369
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,451
[KONEKO]
Fo sho, I couldn't agree more.

370
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,203
[XENOVIA] Thanks.

371
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,247
Akeno, see if we can't find any
more info on this one, please.

372
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,456
‐[humming]
‐[both gasp]

373
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,382
‐Good afternoon, Ravel, dear.
‐[RAVEL] Mother!

374
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,177
‐[MOTHER] Are Rias and
the Red Dragon Emperor available

375
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,596
by any chance?

376
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,348
Why, hello there, Auntie.
It's been quite a while.

377
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,769
Indeed, it has been, Rias.
Good to see you. You look well.

378
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,398
Hi. I'm Issei Hyodo.
Nice to meet ya.

379
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,358
So, you're the Dragon Emperor.

380
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,277
It's so nice to meet you
as well.

381
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,195
I've heard many
wonderful things about you,

382
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,324
and I feel so rude that I can't
be there to meet you in person.

383
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,493
Oh, no, you good! But there
was something you needed me for?

384
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,163
[MOTHER] Well, yes,
it's nothing too important.

385
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,081
I just wanted
to introduce myself,

386
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,500
even if it's not
in a more proper manner.

387
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,086
Seriously, Auntie,
please stop worrying about it.

388
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,213
We're happy to see you
however we can.

389
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:55,384
Thank you, Rias.
I did want to ask Mister Hyodo

390
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,719
to take good care of my daughter

391
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,137
while she's
attending your school.

392
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,514
Uh, yeah, totally.

393
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,016
I'll be a real boss about it,

394
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,684
and thankfully
the president's here too,

395
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,895
and she can def keep
a better eye on your girl.

396
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,689
[MOTHER] Of course.
Naturally, that's reassuring.

397
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,232
However,
I'm asking that you protect

398
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,985
from the various evils
of the human world specifically.

399
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,862
The evils
of the whatty‐what now?

400
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,073
If the Red Dragon Emperor,
who's famous

401
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,200
for his numerous,
distinguished victories

402
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,534
stays by my Ravel's side,

403
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,786
then I know my husband and I

404
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,454
will be able to feel more
at ease

405
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,332
while she's away from home,
and we can hope for good news.

406
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:29,543
Yeah, I hear ya loud and clear,
Missus Phoenix, ma'am.

407
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,504
Don't worry.
I'll take care of your daughter!

408
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,632
‐[gasps]
‐[MOTHER] Thank you so much.

409
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,509
And as for you, Ravel dear,

410
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,386
be on your best behavior,
all right?

411
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,681
Make sure you always listen
to Rias and follow her example.

412
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,475
Study hard to learn as much
as you can about the human world

413
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,851
and make our family proud.

414
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,603
Of course, Mother!

415
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,563
And as a personal favor to me,

416
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,565
try to be good friends
with the Dragon Emperor.

417
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,527
‐One more thing.
‐Uh, what's up?

418
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:58,155
Rumor has it that you wish
to become a high‐ranking devil.

419
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,615
That's right. Um. Why?

420
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,617
It just so happens
that my daughter

421
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,452
has been returned to my family.

422
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,746
I conducted a trade with Riser
for her.

423
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,666
As such, there's something
I wanted to let you know.

424
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,711
Right now, she's available.
Keep that in mind.

425
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,171
‐Yes ma'am. I gotcha!
‐[gasps]

426
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:19,260
Thank you, what a relief!
Well then. Good day, everyone!

427
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,560
[RIAS scoffs]

428
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:32,481
Uh, hey. Something wrong, Prez?

429
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:38,738
Issei. I need to know.
Will you protect me?

430
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,200
Yeah, of course.
I'd die for you, President.

431
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,661
‐[RIAS] What about Asia?
‐[ISSEI] Huh?

432
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,913
Yeah, I'd protect her, too.

433
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,623
[RIAS]
And Akeno?

434
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,168
[ISSEI chuckles]
Duh, totally! Why wouldn't I?

435
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,379
Still though.
Why are you asking?

436
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,505
Somethin' up?

437
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,634
‐Issei. Tell me.
‐Yeah, what?

438
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,472
What am I to you?
How do you see me?

439
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,432
Umm...

440
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,517
Just answer me, already!

441
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,896
Okay, uh. Let me think.

442
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,856
‐Well, you're the president.
‐[sobs]

443
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,149
You're an ass!

444
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,611
‐Uhh...
‐Oh, god.

445
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,572
[ASIA]
Rias, wait!

446
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,366
I can't believe you, Issei!

447
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,202
[ISSEI]
Huh?

448
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,912
‐But...
‐[KIBA] Even by your standards,

449
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,539
‐that was way oblivious.
‐Huh?

450
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,291
I don't get it. What'd I do?

451
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,668
Man, I don't know
where to begin.

452
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,046
And honestly, no one should have
to explain it to you

453
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,130
at this point.

454
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,840
Why is it everyone in this room

455
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,009
knows exactly what you
did wrong, except you?

456
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,969
Yeah, sorry, but you are, like,
seriously

457
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,638
the dumbest guy ever, Issei.

458
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,473
You can suck it.

459
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,643
‐Don't you dare.
‐Huh?

460
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,019
If you go after her right now

461
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,479
without knowing
why you're going,

462
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,147
you'll only make things worse.

463
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,399
What about you, Gasper?

464
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,151
Do you think I'm a piece
of shit, too?

465
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,946
Well, yeah. I actually kinda do.

466
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,906

I'm sorry.
This all happened

468
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,993
because of my mother and I,
didn't it?

469
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,913
No, of course not, sweetie.
no one blames you.

00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:13,499
If anything,
it's obviously Issei's fault

471
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,835
for being such
an incredibly brainless dildo

472
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,753
when it comes to
Rias's feelings.

00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:20,881
[gasps]
What's a brainless dildo to do?
