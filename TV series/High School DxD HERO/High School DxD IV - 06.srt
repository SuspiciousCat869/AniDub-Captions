it was built to ensure

00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,921
No promises, but yeah, you too.

159
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,340
Go, Vritra Promotion!

160
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,472
[roars]

161
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,682
Well, look at that.

162
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,935
One of the five
great dragon kings.

163
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:06,356
It's the Prison Dragon Vritra.
So he really has returned.

164
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,945
[ISSEI]
Asia! Take care of Kunou.

165
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,113
Right!

166
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,573
[ISSEI] Kunou,
can you take care of Asia?

167
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,284
Yes, of course! However...

168
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,996
[ISSEI]
Yeah, don't worry.

169
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,833
We're gonna do our best
to win this fight,

170
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,168
‐and save your mother!
‐Right!

171
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,046
[DDRAIG] Welsh Dragon,
Balance Breaker!

172
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,136
[ISSEI] Hey!
Are you stronger than Vali?

173
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:40,140
Who knows? But I will
tell you that I'm not weak,

174
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,809
even if I am
from the weak human race.

175
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,811
[ISSEI shouts]

[BOTH roar]

177
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:12,005
[AKENO] You know, Issei
hasn't contacted us in a while.

178
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,798
‐Aren't you worried?
‐[RIAS] No.

179
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,466
Though I guess
I feel a bit restless

180
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,093
since he's so far away,

181
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:21,598
but I'm sure everything's fine.

182
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,393
Totes. I'm sure the perv is
loving his last night in Kyoto.

183
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:29,147
Well, Kyoto can be
a city of temptations. Right?

184
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,899
Oh? Your lingerie.

185
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:36,321
You mean these? I just got them.
What do you think?

186
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,072
Well, they do hold boobs.

187
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,116
[AKENA giggles]
Wow, Rias.

188
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,076
You're certainly trying hard
to impress a boy

189
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,954
who's not even here.
You must really miss him.

190
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,250
Mmm. I do.

191
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:51,794

[chuckles]

194
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,020
It looks like this is
a two‐sword job.

195
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,232
Let's spice things up, shall we?

196
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,776
I'll show both
of you a little trick.

197
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,569
My Balance Breaker!

198
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,411
[gasps]
He has six swords now?

199
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:29,499
These are the demon swords
Tyrfing and Dainsleif.

200
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,585
I also have a sword of light
that's perfect for devils.

201
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,671
[KIBA]
He's like an Asura.

202
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,966
And this is my Chaos Edge,
Asura Ravage.

203
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,509
Like my Twice Critical,

204
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,512
this Balance Breaker
is also a subspecies.

205
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,763
Show me what you've got!

206
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,393
Damn, girl, look at you go,
you're killin' it!

207
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,311
I gotta say,
you're pretty good for an angel!

208
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,022
[shouts]

209
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,277
This is Blade Blacksmith.

210
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,195
It's the holy version
of the demon thing

211
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,698
your cute friend's
using over there.

212
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:05,201
Better hold on tight now,
it gets better.

213
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,412
Check out my Balance Break.

214

[roars]

216
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,345
No way, a dragon
made of holy swords?

217
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,348
[JEANNE]
You wanna know what I call him?

218
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,059
"Stake Victim" Dragon.

219
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,687
He's a subspecies, too.
Cool, huh?

220
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,106
Jeanne d'Arc, the holy maiden.

221
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:39,152
I can't believe I'm fighting
against her reincarnation.

222
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,030
But I have to do this for
Lord Michael and everyone else!

223
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,448
I can't let her win!

224
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,871
I guess we're
playing show n' tell.

225
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,248
Here's my Balance Break!

[shouting]

227
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,887
Pretty impressive stuff,
isn't it?

228
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,598
This is
Detonation Mighty Comet!

I'm sorry, my friends
can be real show offs.

233
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,459
They just love their toys.

234
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,461
[ISSEI] Ever heard
of overcompensation?

235
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,213
Might as well
whip yours out, too.

236
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,007
No thanks. Personally,
I think it's good for a man

237
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,760
to have at least a few secrets.
[chuckles]

238
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,887
Besides, I don't need
it to beat you.

239
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,224
That's enough chit‐chat.
Show me what you're capable of!

240
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,435
Come on.

241
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,312
[ISSEI growls]
Bring it!

[ISSEI grunts, gags]

243
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:08,157
Aw, it's not
that you're weak, per say.

244
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,493
You just have
a lot of openings.

245
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:11,577
[ISSEI breathes hard]

246
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,457
[gasps] Oh no!

00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:29,387
[straining]
Holy crap. That was bad.

248
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,015
My, you were shockingly close
to dying just then.

249
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,018
It happens
so easily for you, huh?

250
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,812
I should probably remind you

251
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,356
that this particular weapon
is a Holy Spear,

252
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,567
and no matter how
strong you eventually become,

253
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,653
you'll never be able
to overcome its raw power,

254
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,655
because you are a devil.

Well, color me surprised.

I was sure that last part
would scare you off.

259
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,127
[ISSEI pants]
Of course I'm scared,

260
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,255
but I can't worry
about that shit right now.

261
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:07,175
Everyone's expecting me
to eff you up,

262
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,010
but if I can't even
get one punch in,

263
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,929
then I don't deserve to be
the Red Dragon Emperor.

How noble.

How's that for a counter?

274
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,260
Ascalon's power
should be more than enough

275
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,387
to knock you down
a peg or two. [gasps]

It's a weakness that may lead
to your ultimate undoing.

how you triggered

some hits of my own.

Still, it was
a fairly decent attack.

to up my game.

[AZAZEL]
Protect Kyoto and yourselves.

316
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,166
[ISSEI]
Azazel.

317
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,002
I'm sorry. I really
messed up this time.

318
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,755
‐[howling]
‐[KUNOU] Mother!

319
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,798
[ISSEI]
I promised I'd save her mom,

320
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,675
but I couldn't live up to that.

321
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,429
Why am I so useless?

322
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:02,266
Why can't I do anything
when it matters the most?

323
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,435
It was a nice try,
Red Dragon Emperor.

324
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,148
[ISSEI sobs]

325
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,193
No matter how badly I want it,

326
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,612
I'm just too damn weak
to beat him!

327
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,448
Is this my actual limit?

328
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,617
It's not... fair.

329
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,910
[sobs]

330
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:25,081
No, I don't wanna give up!
I wanna keep fighting,

331
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,209
but nothing I do seems to work.

332
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,379
[ELSHA]
Are you crying?

333
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,880
[gasps]

334
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,342
I know those boobs.

335
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:39,887
Yes, it's me.
Why are you crying?

336
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,893
Because... I'm a loser.

337
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,896
And I'm frustrated
that I can't do anything.

338
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,649
I'm a huge failure.

339
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,984
I just let everyone
I know down.

340
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,279
[ELSHA]
Yes, that is rather frustrating.

341
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:01,075
However, you're still you.

342
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,535
[AZAZEL]
Grabbin' Dragon!

343
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,412
Now there's a nickname for you.

344
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,247
You're different from Vali.

345
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,873
Forget about everyone else.

346
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,375
You should master the power

347
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,585
of the Red Dragon Emperor
in your own way.

348
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,547
[gasps, grumbles]

349
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,299
That's right.
I'm the Grabbin' Dragon.

350
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,760
Indeed. That is who you are.

351
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,847
The current Red Dragon Emperor.
The Grabbin' Dragon.

352
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,890
Embrace it,
and release the potential

353
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,059
that Belzard and I
saw within you.

354
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,812
The time has come at last.

355
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,857
Hold the orb up to the sky
and call it forth.

356
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,192
‐[ISSEI] Call what?
‐Well, the boobs

357
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,652

[GROUP gasps]

359
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,874
[ZOMBIES]
Boobies. Boobies.

360
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,459
[ISSEI]
Uh, what's happening?

361
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,044
[ELSHA] Hopping
from one person to the next,

362
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,173
that orb was able
to travel all over Kyoto.

363
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,216
The afterimages
of what it experienced

364
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,843
took on the form of people.

365
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,595
[ISSEI]
Whoa! So in a way,

366
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,555
there really is
a zombie perv‐ocalypse,

367
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,140
but with like shadow molesters!

‐[ZOMBIES] Bazongas.
‐[ISSEI] Wow.

There's a lot of 'em.

370
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,606
Well, this is odd,
and probably a first.

371
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,441
Is that an army
of zomboobies?

372
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,068
[ZOMBIES]
Boobies! Melon. Melon.

[ELSHA]
The preparations are complete!

375
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:27,787
Let's call it forth.

376
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,915
[ISSEI]
Uh, call what forth?

377
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,584
I already told you before.
Call for the boobs

378
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,169
that are meant
just for you, Issei.

379
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:38,047
[ISSEI]
Just... for me.

380
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,634
Yes, now do it!

381
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:45,888
[ISSEI]
Okay.

382
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,681
I summon...
