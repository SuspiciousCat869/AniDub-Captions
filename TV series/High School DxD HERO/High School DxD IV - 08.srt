17
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,984
everyone in the Gremory family
was asked

18

to put on a kid's show
for the Underworld.

This show's pretty good!

Yeah, and the acting
is on point!

26

Personally, I like the special
effects and wire work action.

27
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,093

they did a lot of research

squeezing you into this dress?

The usual lady narrator person
twisted her ankle or something,

so they asked
if maybe I could fill in.

than any of the kids.

I don't mind filling in for her,

but the costume is
a little tight.

area, you know?

00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,291
The children of the Underworld
are smitten with it.

158
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,086
They simply can't get enough
of the Grabbin' Dragon.

159
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,504
I hope that you'll continue

160
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,172
the wonderful work
you're doing here,

161
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,799
not only for all the children
of the Underworld,

162
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,634
but for the rest of the
Gremory family

163
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,219
and our beloved
daughter as well.

164
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,430
Oh, yes, ma'am!
I won't let you down!

165
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,306
Don't you worry
Miss President's Mom!

166
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,851
[VENERANA] Thank you, though
I'd really prefer you call me

167
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,395
something else besides
"Miss President's Mom".

168
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,897
You could always call me
"Mother‐in‐law"

169
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,691
or, better yet, just "Mother."

170
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,860
I dunno, sounds kinda kinky.

171
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,320
No, it's only kinky
if you say "Mommy."

172
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,949
Besides, it's embarrassing
for you to be so formal with me,

173
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,826
especially during public events.

174
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,661
And furthermore,
I'm not sure why

175
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,997
you've taken to calling Rias
"President" in the first place.

176
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,999
‐[ISSEI] Huh?
‐Tell me, Issei,

177
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,792
‐do you love my daughter?
‐Duh!

178
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,794
Of course I do!
I love her, and respect her,

179
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,047
and all that other stuff dudes
say to get lucky!

180
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,883
I would rather die than let
anything bad happen to her!

181
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,718
I see.

182
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,387
That confirms your beautiful
master‐and‐servant relationship.

183
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,347
And those feelings
are quite natural,

184
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,099
but what about
beyond that?

185
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,643
As in, what does Rias
mean to you personally,

186
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,980
not only as your master,
but as something more?

187
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,735
Yeah, good question.
Uh, I'll think on it.

188
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:33,198
Rias. It's not just Issei. You
should think about it, as well.

189
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,240
[RIAS]
Right.

190
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,744
[door opens, closes]

191
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,163
[RIAS] Well, we should
probably head home

192
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,082
and start prepping
for the school festival.

193
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,669
'Cause... there's still a lot
that needs to be sorted out.

194
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,380
Okay.

195
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,354
[STUDENT 7A] So, tell us
all about where you're from!

196
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,980
[STUDENT 7B] Phoenix is such a
cool last name!

197
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,899
It sounds like a superhero!

198
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,443
[STUDENT 7C] This class is big
on overseas transfer students,

199
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,905
like not that long ago we got
this total cutie named Gasper.

200
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,449
[STUDENT 7D] Ooh, maybe we could
grab some tea together sometime!

201
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,285
Sounds delightful.
[nervous laugh]

202
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,870
[RIAS] I wanted to
check in on Ravel

203
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,497
since she just transferred here.

204
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,125
Is it me or does she seem
a little nervous?

205
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,544
[ISSEI]
Yeah. Which is like hella weird.

206
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,462
I thought she'd be all like...

207
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,923
[loud laugh]

208
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,176
Ask me your questions, mortals,
and I shall answer you!

209
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,970
She's so normal.

210
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,180
‐[STUDENTS gasp]
‐Uh, please excuse me.

211
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,183
[ISSEI grunts]

212
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,644
‐[sighs]
‐Is something wrong?

213
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,897
Well, this is the first time
I've ever transferred schools,

214
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,524
and seeing as I'm a devil
and all that,

215
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,484
I have no idea how
I'm supposed to interact

216
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,653
with these overly‐curious
human teenagers.

217
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,488
Sucks to be you right now.

218
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,949
I can see how that might be
a little nerve‐wracking for you,

219
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,450
so perhaps
we could find a classmate

220
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,119
that you'd be
more familiar with.

221
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,954
Yo, what it do?

222
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:06,833
We have a favor to ask. I'm sure
you remember Ravel Phoenix.

223
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,251
We were hoping
you could be her friend

224
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,752
and explain
how things work here.

225
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,421
Sure, whatevs.

226
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,091
Besides, cats love
fried chicken.

227
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,343
Did you just call me a chicken?

228
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,805
‐Yeah. So?
‐[scoffs] How dare you!

229
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,515
I can't believe
you have the audacity

230
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,267
to insult a member
of the Phoenix family!

231
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,644
You've only been
at this school for one day

232
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,021
and you're already
causing a bunch

233
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,439
of problems
for the prez and Issei,

234
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,982
so all things considered,

235
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,650
you're lucky I stopped
at "fried chicken."

236
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,861
Well, better a fried chicken
than a little pussy!

237
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,488
‐Wish granted.
‐[growls]

238
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,074
[whimpers]
But she's so scary!

239
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,827
Come on.
It's not like she's a monster,

240
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,621
so you could at least try
and get along.

241
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,998
When did you get
into friendship mediating?

242
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,667
‐What are you talking about?
‐[scofffs]

243
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,336
Uh, I'm just trying to be

244
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,046
a good example
to the younger students!

245
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,756
Why do you gotta bust
my chops about it?

246
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,758
[RAVEL and KONEKO growl]

247
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:01,679
I'm worried that our super
awesome plan wasn't so awesome.

248
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,557
Yes. I'm concerned, too.

249
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,187
All right then.
Everyone know what to do now?

250
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,730
[ALL]
Yeah!

251
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,690
[AKENO] We get to make
the old school building

252
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,319
into an occult mansion.
Talk about exciting!

253
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,613
[XENOVIA] There's gonna be a
haunted house,

254
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,406
and a fortune teller,

255
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,243
oh, and a maid cafÃ©, too!
Should be a lot of fun, huh?

256
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,994
I'm excited too,
but I'm a little worried

257
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,746
about taking
on such a large project

258
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,289
when we don't have
that much time

259
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,124
to complete everything
in the first place.

260
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,877
It's not like we haven't pulled
off impossible feats before.

261
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,170
I believe in us!

262
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,550
[KIBA] Hey, Issei,
have you given any thought

263
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,344
to the Rating Game
with Sairaorg?

264
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,429
[ISSEI]
Yeah. I'm trying to figure out

265
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,973
how I can beat that guy.

266
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,432
[KIBA] The dude's tough.

267
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,685
Sairaorg does know
some of our basic moves,

268
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,312
and we know about his,
but we can surprise him

269
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,148
with stuff like your new skill
and Xenovia's Ex‐Durandal.

270
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,527
The game's outcome may depend
on how we play those new assets.

271
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,905
[ISSEI] The combo attack
saps my power like a mofo,

272
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,657
so I gotta be sure to save
that kick‐ass technique

273
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,575
for just the right moment.

274
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,911
I'll train with you,
if you want to.

275
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,162
I've been working
on the framework

276
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,706
for a brand‐new attack.

277
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,500
‐[ISSEI] You too, huh?
‐It's a secret, though.

278
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,460
[AZAZEL] Looks like
some intense male bonding.

279
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,005
[chuckles]
What's with the whispering?

280
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,506
Oh, you know, just wondering

281
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,383
if someone pissed
in your hair or what.

282
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,093
Anyway, didn't you have
a staff meeting?

283
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,761
Meh, it was boring,

284
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,972
so I ditched it and left
Rossweisse there to take notes.

285
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,390
Jerk move.

286
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,391
I'm actually here
to speak to Ddraig

287
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,684
about a personal matter.

288
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,269
I found the name
of that counselor.

289
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,063
[DDRAIG]
Thanks, sorry for the trouble.

290
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,232
Why does he need to talk
to a counselor?

291
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:39,235
Ever since the Kyoto trip he's
had sudden bouts of depression,

292
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,904
so he used Fafnir's orb
to ask if I could help find him

293
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,949
a counselor for his issues.
Words like "fun bags"

294
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,951
or "jubblies" are
a trigger for him.

295
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,203
The poor guy just spirals
into a dark place.

296
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,164
[gasps]
Seriously, bro?

297
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,291
[DDRAIG] Yes,
I can't seem to get over it,

298
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,544
but don't worry about me.
Regardless of how I feel,

299
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,838
you should be able
to power up when needed.

300
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,383
Yup. It looks like boob miracles
are pretty hard on him.

301
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,678
I mean, not everyone
is as perverted as you are.

302
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,014
Ddraig is a heavenly dragon
after all.

303
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,808
He's supposed to be a creature
full of dignity and honor.

304
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,810
I mean, using pillows
to power up?

305
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,355
Well, it's no surprise
it makes the guy upset.

306
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,232
Yeah, I guess I never really
thought of it like that before.

307
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,027
You know, now that you've
mentioned it, Ddraig does seem

308
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:24,364
to cry anytime I use Rias' nips
to get super swole or whatever.

309
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,324
[DDRAIG] I'm sorry,
it seems my spirit

310
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,284
isn't as strong
as I thought it was.

311
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,952
[emotionally]
I am ashamed!

312
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,163
Hey, you shouldn't
have to apologize

313
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,374
just 'cause your dude's
a total boob‐loving man‐whore

314
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,126
who relies on a girl's nips
to power up! I'm sorry!

315
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,795
[AZAZEL]
Well, it was no easy feat,

316
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,297
finding a counselor
that specialized in dragons.

317
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,841
I'll shoot
over the contact info.

318
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,010
I'm a total failure
as a partner.

319
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,221
[DDRAIG cries]
Don't say that.

320
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,931
[ISSEI] Can you forgive me?

321
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,183
Even though there will
constantly be hooters around me,

322
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,811
I'll always care
about you more, probably!

323
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,312
[DDRAIG]
Ah. Well, at this point

324
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,189
I suppose I'll take
what I can get.

325
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,857
[crying]
Just do your best.

326
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,110
[emotionally]
Okay, I'll try.

327
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,320
Just hang in there, good buddy!

328
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,490
[sobbing]

329
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,992
[RIAS] Sorry to interrupt
you and your hand.

330
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,661
Huh? President!

331
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,455
We need to talk about something
that's been worrying me.

332
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,916
I got a call
from Sairaorg's butler.

333
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,793
He would like to request
a personal favor

334
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,169
from the two of us, so...

335
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,630
Whoa, he has his own butler?

336
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,593
I've never actually been
to the Sitri domain before.

337
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,512
Guess it's no surprise
it's so nice.

338
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,597
Indeed. Besides being pretty,

339
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,015
it's also one of the few domains

340
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,143
with exceptional
medical facilities.

341
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,561
That's hella dope.

342
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,479
Anyway, the place we're
going to now

343
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,523
is one of the best there is.

344
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,776
Initially, Sairaorg's butler
contacted my mother

345
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,361
before he reached out to me.

346
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,113
Remind me, did I ever tell you

347
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,906
that my mother is
from the Bael family?

348
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,826
Maybe? No, wait, I think
you have mentioned it,

349
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,120
and that's where the whole
cousin thing comes into play?

350
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:57,331
Yes, that's correct, but what
I probably failed to tell you is

351
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,500
that his mother is
from the Vapula family,

352
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,711
AKA one of the 72 pillars.

353
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,963
They carry
the symbol of the lion.

354
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,631
That sounds pretty bad ass,

355
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,967
and it's fitting, for Sairaorg.

356
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,944
‐[heart monitor beeping]
‐May I present Lady Misla Bael.

357
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,198
She is Lord Sairaorg's
beloved mother.

358
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:34,285
Thank you both for coming all
this way on such short notice.

359
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,330
Lord Sairaorg does not know
that I have asked you here,

360
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,624
but I beg you to hear me out.

361
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,084
Please, Lady Rias,
Red Dragon Emperor,

362
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,128
do you think you could possibly
lend us your strength

363
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,173
and help us to awaken
Lady Misla from her slumber?

364
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,217
Uh, yeah, I don't really follow.

365
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,552
Right, I'll try
to explain, then.

366
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:55,014
See, when Sairaorg was born
into the Bael family,

367
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,974
everyone was overjoyed
to hear the news

368
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,101
that an heir
had finally been born.

369
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,854
However, shortly afterwards,
his birth proved to be

370
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,773
a disappointment to his family.

371
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:07,401
Let me guess, it's because he
didn't have any demonic power?

372
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,154
Mm‐hmm.
Not only that,

373
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,657
it was also very upsetting
that the new child

374
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,035
hadn't inherited the family's
emblematic Power of Destruction.

375
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,788
Sairaorg's father felt such
dishonor that he blamed

376
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,624
his own wife for the disgrace
of their "defective son."

377
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,251
After that, she had
no choice but to live

378
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,127
the rest of her life
in the shadows.

379
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,629
[ISSEI]
That blows.

380
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,214
My mother tried
to take the two of them in,

381
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,924
but Lord Bael refused her.

382
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,676
They are a very proud family,

383
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,970
and that pride made it
to where he saw them

384
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,265
as an embarrassment.
It's silly, really,

385
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,935
but he didn't want anyone
to find out about them.

386
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,356
[BUTLER] Lady Misla was forced
to raise Lord Sairaorg

387
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,858
in the outlands
of the Bael domain.

388
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,027
They had very little choice
in the matter.

389
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,697
When Lord Sairaorg was a child,

390
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,658
he would cry frequently,
but the lady would tell him...

391
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,578
Don't cry, at least you
still have a strong body.

392
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,788
Why don't you make it
even stronger,

393
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,790
so you can make up
for what you don't have?

394
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,084
You may not have demonic power,

395
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,670
but you are still
a child of Bael.

396
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:13,092
"You will definitely win as
long as you never give up hope."

397
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,428
Those are the words
she used to say to him.

398
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,097
They meant a lot to Sairaorg,

399
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,932
and he's always treasured them.

400
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,184
[BUTLER]
However, she was still concerned

401
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,228
for him deep in her heart.

402
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,690
She used to shed so many tears,
worrying over her son.

403
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,234
Sometimes she would sit
by his bedside and just cry.

404
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,529
Lady Misla's feelings must
have reached him, though,

405
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,406
because Lord Sairaorg grew up

406
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,701
to be a strong
and resilient young master.

407
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,995
But, just as the rays of hope
had finally deigned

408
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,830
to shine on Lord Sairaorg,

409
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,249
the poor Lady Misla
unexpectedly fell

410
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,959
into a demonic sickness.

411
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,502
It's a very rare disease here

412
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,630
in the underworld
that only affects devils.

413
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,548
Once the illness takes hold,

414
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,925
the victim falls
into a deep, unending sleep.

415
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,553
Their bodies eventually
grow weak and perish.

416
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:01,307
At this moment, they're doing
all they can to keep her alive.

417
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,686
[ISSEI] That sucks, but why do
you think I'll be able to help?

418
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,480
I'm no doctor.

419
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,732
Well, I heard that you possess
a rather unique power,

420
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,651
one that enables you to listen
to the inner thoughts

421
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,860
of a woman's bosom?

422
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,821
[gasps]
Boobielingual?

423
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,490
Please, Red Dragon Emperor,

424
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,743
use your special ability
to listen to Lady Misla's voice!

425
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,245
Her doctor already approved
of your involvement.

426
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,998
‐I'm begging you, sir.
‐I don't know.

427
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,626
At least consider it, Issei.
Your power has been able

428
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,920
to do so many amazing things
in the past.

429
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,922
Think about this.
You might be it,

430
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,007

who has the ability to reach

431

‐my aunt's consciousness.
‐Okay, I'll try.

433
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,062
[ISSEI] I'm really sorry.
I let you down.

434
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:51,190
[RIAS]
Don't be so hard on yourself.

435
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,150
Sure, we weren't able
to hear her voice,

436
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,277
but it's not like
you didn't try your best.

437
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,196
[ISSEI]
Still.

438
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,281
You even used
your Balance Break.

439
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,659
You increased your power
to its absolute highest limit,

440
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,786
and did everything
you possibly could.

I'm sure her butler was
thankful for what you did.

Hey there.

[RIAS]
Yes, if anything,

I should probably
be apologizing to you,

Issei about your past...

00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,458
All I want is to have
a good ol' fashioned brawl

461
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,793
with the Gremory family.

462
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,254
This is all I've got.

463
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,881
For someone who has nothing,

464
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,216
the only path
is the one of victory.

465
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,678
If I lose even once, I risk
losing everything else.

466
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,390
The only power I can rely on
is my own body.

467
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,434
And that's why
I'm going to come at you

468
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,269
with everything I have.

469
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,271
Yeah, the past is in the past,

470
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,440
and it won't keep me
from kicking yo ass!

471
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,317
Your soap opera childhood
isn't enough

472
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,068
to make me let up,
got that?

473
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,404
Maybe it sounds crazy,
but I have a dream

474
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,573
about becoming
a high‐ranking devil one day!

475
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,993
I'm gonna do whatever it takes.
But in order for that to happen,

476
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:29,246
I gotta defeat you in
the upcoming Rating Game.

477
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,332
It's not personal or anything,

478
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,418
so try to remember that when
I'm kicking your teeth in!

479
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,545
Yes, now that's
the kinda fiery passion

480
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,422
you can cook a s'more on.

481
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,508
It seems you've not
only gained strength,

482
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,885
but also confidence
since our last encounter.

483
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,428
[ISSEI] Huh?

484
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,388
The rating game will be
an event to remember,

485
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,057
and I'm looking forward
to facing you both

486
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,433
on the battlefield soon.

487
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,352
We're looking
forward to it, too.

488
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,354
[chuckles]

489
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,688
[chuckles]

490
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,198
[RIAS]
Issei looks so strong right now.

491
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,119
Maybe that's the reason I‐‐
Yes, that's why.

492
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,289
Hm. Hey, are you okay?

493
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,419
[chuckles]

494
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,809
