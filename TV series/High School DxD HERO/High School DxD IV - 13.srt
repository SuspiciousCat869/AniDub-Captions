Time for the romantic kiss!

313
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,841
[ISSEI, RIAS gasp]

314
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:59,805
[ISSEI, RIAS chuckle]

315
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,265
[ISSEI]
Rias.

316
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,600
[RIAS]
Issei.

317
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,090
[SAIRAORG]
How's Issei doin' these days?

318
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:01,093
[AZAZEL] Good, he finally manned
up and confessed to Rias.

319
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:03,095
You know, I really do
think those two kids

320
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,847
are a good fit in the long run.

321
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,349
I'm surprised you're worried
about others right now.

322
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,478
You're a pretty decent guy Lord
Sairaorg, through and through.

323
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,354
[SAIRAORG]
Heh.

324
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,482
So then, back to
square one, huh?

325
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,150
I'm used to these
kind of things.

326
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,985
It's honestly no big deal.

327
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:21,113
Can you believe Issei was
concerned about your status?

328
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:25,284
Please tell him this for me:
I'm gonna be back on top.

329
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:28,621
My Lord Sairaorg!

330
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,289
[SAIRAORG gasps]

331
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,333
[NURSES gasp]

332
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,918
[DOCTOR A gasps]

333
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,384
Mother?

334
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,013
[SAIRAORG gasps]
Mother!

335
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:49,225
It's Sairaorg, please say
that you recognize me.

336
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,228
I do. You're my dearest son.

337
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,646
[SAIRAORG gasps]

338
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,567
Oh Sairaorg, look how
strong you've become.

339
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,862
In my dreams, I felt
like I watched you grow,

340
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,448
not only as a man
but as a person.

341
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,659
I'm so proud of you, darling.

342
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,828
I've missed you so much.

343
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,289
[SAIRAORG sobs]

344
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:17,253
Mother. Let's go home. Together.

345
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,921
[AZAZEL]
I have a sneaking suspicion

346
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:22,925
who created this miracle.
It had to be Boobielingual.

347
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,969
There's no other explanation.

348
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,721
The Grabbin Dragon
strikes again.

349
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:31,475
He manages to get through even
the thickest personal bubbles.

350
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,687
I wonder how far his
naiveté will reach?

351
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:39,066
I'm interested to see
what he'll do next.

352
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:42,653
[AZAZEL] Lord Sakra!
May I have a word?

353
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,656
Yo. 'Sup, Fallen Angel
of Justice?

354
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,075
[AZAZEL] Cut the crap,
you knew about Cao Cao

355
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,869
before we did, didn't you?

356
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,580
[SAKRA]
Heh. Can you be more specific?

357
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,291
I've known him since he was
a pint‐sized little brat.

358
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,042
Why do ya care so much?

359
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:57,877
Dammit, Indra!

360
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:01,463
[SAKRA laughs] I can't
believe you called me that,

361
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,633
looks like baby Azazel's balls
have dropped, am I right?

362
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:05,926
[AZAZEL grunts]

363
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:06,844
Hey, listen.

364
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:09,680
It's in a God's nature to
spout out stupid ideals while

365
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,765
doing whatever they
please in the shadows.

366
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,893
So you're just gonna have
to get off your high horse.

367
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,104
Yes, I'm aware. However...

368
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,940
[SAKRA] Fine, just chill out,
I'll throw you a friggin' bone.

369
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:23,235
It is true that Orphis
has become a problem.

370
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:26,322
In return, give that Tit
Dragon a message for me.

371
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,699
Tell him I think he's
a total bad ass.

372
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,159
And that if he does
get outta line,

373
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,453
that I have no problem
whatsoever destroying

374
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,164
what's left of his
decrepit soul.

375
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:39,793
Cause the label of heaven
is only available to us.
