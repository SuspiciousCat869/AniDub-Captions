00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:09,875
[NARRATOR]
This young boy's name is Lute,

2
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:12,875
a rash, but enthusiastic fellow
who dreams of becoming

3
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:15,041
the world's top Monster Rider.

4
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:17,333
Lute and his friends,
Cheval, Mille, and Hyoro,

5
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:21,458
spend their days training
in the isolated Hakum Village.

6
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,333
Lute has a Monstie
named Rathalos,

7
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:24,958
with whom he's formed Kinship,

8
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,750
but the pair still
have a ways to go

9
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:29,416
before they're on the same page.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,583
Will Lute ever make it
as a full-fledged Rider?

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,125
Hyoro, pick up the pace!

12
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,208
[HYORO]
Yeah!

13
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,833
[NARRATOR]
Genie is Hyoro's big brother,

14
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,375
and already a talented Rider.

15
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,500
You're too slow! Come on!

16
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,125
[NARRATOR]
Hyoro is still a junior Rider,

17
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:51,416
struggling to meet his
brother's high expectations.

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,791
Hyoro's nice,

19
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:55,041
but he might be the most
timid person Navirou knows.

20
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:58,125
It's 'cause his big bro's
always on his case.

21
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,375
[BOTH gasp]

22
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,500
[GENIE]
What're you doing, Hyoro?

23
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,458
You keep signaling late.

24
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,166
This is exactly what
I'm warning you about

25
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,291
when I tell you to do it
quickly and clearly.

26
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,083
Come on, Genie, I barely
bumped into the obstacle.

27
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,416
No excuse!

28
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,541
What if you got caught in
a Monster's hot breath?

29
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,625
You'd get more than
just a scratch.

30
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,708
[HYORO]
You're right, Genie.

31
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,916
[LUTE yells]

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,916
[LUTE]
Onward, Ratha!

33
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:38,250
[LUTE] Hey, wait!
Slow down. Ratha, listen!

34
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,500
--Right! Right! Right! Right!
--Left! Left! Left! Left! Left!

35
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,625
[LUTE, NAVIROU scream]

36
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,166
Lute, no!

37
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,958
Are you guys both
still in one piece?

38
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,208
[LUTE, NAVIROU]
We're fine, Stone.

39
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,208
It's all your fault
I'm soaking wet.

40
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,500
It's all your fault for
messing up the directions.

41
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,250
No way, it's your
fault, Navirou!

42
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,166
Navirou will never
take the blame!

43
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,458
But it's your fault!

44
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:07,750
It's all your fault!

45
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:08,666
Your fault!

46
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,500
Your fault!

47
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,458
Admit it, it's your fault!

48
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,708
No, you admit it!

49
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,291
[LUTE] I'll pull those
whiskers off your face!

50
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,583
You wouldn't dare!

51
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,458
The whiskers are Navirou's
handsomest feature!

52
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,166
[RATHA growls]

53
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,208
[BOTH yelp]

54
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,166
[CHEVAL, HYORO]
Oh no!

55
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,416
Are you okay?

56
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh. Ratha's breath
got me all dry.

57
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,833
Navirou's whiskers are set.

58
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,625
[RATHA roars]

59
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,208
Nice work, Ratha!

60
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,708
[LUTE, NAVIROU laugh]

61
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,208
[NAVIROU]
Wanna give it a try, Cheval?

62
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,000
[CHEVAL]
Uh, maybe next time.

63
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,750
Hyoro.

64
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,708
A Rider and his Monstie
can't be friends.

65
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,166
Do you understand?

66
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,333
[HYORO]
Huh?

67
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,000
'Kay, Big Brother.

68
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,708
[DAN]
All right now, listen up.

69
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,541
There are certain rules
that every Rider must obey.

70
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:30,791
The most important one being

71
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,750
that we live our lives
here in Hakum Village,

72
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,125
so our existence is never
revealed to normal society.

73
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:40,000
Okay, but why is it so
bad if they know us?

74
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,375
Well, Cheval.

75
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,625
Many people not from around
here find it strange,

76
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,666
or even scary, that
an experienced Rider

77
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,666
is able to emotionally
bond with a monster

78
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,083
and form Kinship with it.

79
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,083
You don't have
permission to eat that.

80
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,833
[DAN clears throat]

81
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,083
[grumbles]

82
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,083
Monsters are nature.

83
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:00,333
Since we live in harmony with
nature, the same goes for them.

84
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:03,708
I guess when you put it
that way it makes sense.

85
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,541
[DAN]
Our windmills for example.

86
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:09,583
Those big vanes only turn thanks
to the power of the Hakum Gale,

87
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,291
the wind that blows
down the mountain.

88
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:17,416
Just as a windmill uses the
wind, Riders use monsters.

89
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,625
The moral here is that if you
live in peace with nature,

90
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,833
it'll provide you with
everything you need and can--

91
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,708
Stop goofing off
and pay attention!

00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,250
Yeah. Yeah. Nature and stuff.

94
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,166
We got it.

95
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,708
Now see here, you two!

Hey, Dan.

97
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:33,666
[DAN]
Hm?

98
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,166
I know what Lute's problem is.

99
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,750
He learns more by doing
than by listening.

100
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,583
How 'bout a mock battle?

101
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,041
Yeah, you might be
onto somethin' there.

102
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,041
What's a mock battle?

103
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,625
[GENIE] A practice fight,
but with real Monsties.

104
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,958
All right, that sounds
fun! Let's go do it!

105
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,958
Now this is my
kinda lesson!

106
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:54,916
Fine. But you need a partner
to have a practice fight.

107
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,708
[HYORO]
Uhh...

108
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,291
Who, me?

109
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:05,583
Perfect choice! Let's do this!

110
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,208
Uh, yeah, let's do it.

111
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,833
Right. I'll lay out
the ground rules.

112
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,541
Whoever is the first
to pop the balloon

113
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,250
on his opponent's
Monstie is the winner.

114
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh, and direct attacks
on the other Rider

115
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,416
are strictly prohibited!

116
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,625
Got that?

117
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,875
[BOTH]
Yeah!

118
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:27,166
Oh. I almost forgot that
flying is banned, too.

119
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,333
What?

120
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,875
Okay.

[laughs]

122
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,833
You don't have anything
to worry about, Lute!

123
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,541
And why might that be?

124
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,166
'Cause when it comes
to popping balloons,

125
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,958
these whiskers are
lethal weapons!

126

Ow, ow! That hurts! Cut it out!

there goeth Navirou!

Just sit back and leave
this all to Navirou!

[MILLE]
Wow, look at 'em go.

[DAN] It's always gotta be
somethin' with those two.

[LUTE] Then this huge gust
came up outta nowhere!

It blew us straight up!
Then threw us to the side!

Like we were just a leaf!

00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,125
Well, yes, and the windmill

171
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,750
wasn't the only part of the
village to see damage.

172
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,000
Given the strength of that gust,

173
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,291
I'd say it's a miracle
no one was hurt.

easy for that.

However.

Getting the village back
on its feet won't be easy.

Windmill Vanes are quite
precious and hard to replace.

it, that gust was pretty weird.

Have you guys ever heard of the
Hakum Gale being that strong?

191
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,958
That was definitely the
strongest I've ever felt it.

192
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,500
It was blowing roofs off houses.

193

Seems like everything's
off-kilter lately, doesn't it?

Hey, what are you workin' on?

195
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,125
I'm calculating where
that windmill vane landed.

196
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,541
Huh?

197
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,083
[LILIA] Given the vane's weight
and this area's terrain,

198
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,916
and then factoring in
the speed, duration,

199
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,916
and direction of
the wind gust...

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,083
...it's right over there!

Not so fast.

That's it!

Navirou's whiskers say
the vane is over there!

Great. We're goin' this way.

Do you know why this
happened, Hyoro?

216
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,041
Because the Hakum Gale
broke the blade?

217
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,750
That's the obvious answer,
but not the only one.

We're here because you
