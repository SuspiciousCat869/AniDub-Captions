These youngsters are Riders,

blackened Kinship Ore

been spreading across the world.

By using the power of Dr.

Cheval has hatched the
legendary white dragon egg!

dragon is responding!

We'll be okay.

that inscription?

And what does that mean?

00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,166
It means a monster

Ore transformed

into the Black Dread,
