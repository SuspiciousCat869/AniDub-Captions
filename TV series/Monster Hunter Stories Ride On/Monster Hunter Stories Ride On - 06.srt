1
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:09,708
[NARRATOR]
This young boy's name is Lute,

2
00:00:09,791 --> 00:00:12,750
a rash, but enthusiastic
fellow who dreams of becoming

3
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,666
the world's top Monster Rider.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,166
But no one ever said
getting there would be easy.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,666
Every step Lute takes has
a new challenge to overcome!

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,375
Go get 'em, Lute!

7
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:25,208
[LOLOA, CHEVAL]
What? Five hundred Zenny?

8
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,333
[LILIA]
That's right!

9
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,958
The most expensive
item in this shop

10
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,291
will set you back a
whopping 500 Zenny.

11
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,375
Whoa!

12
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,041
Well, if Loloa had
a spare 500 Zenny,

13
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,666
she'd use it to buy new clothes!

14
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,958
And Navirou would buy
dozens of donuts.

15
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,291
Navirou wants to eat so many

16
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:42,291
that Navirou naturally
sweats a sugary glaze!

17
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,291
I'd use it to buy
a very rare book.

18
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,291
A book?

19
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,958
Yes, <i>The Book of Combos</i> .

20
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:51,583
It's incredibly hard to find and
therefore incredibly expensive.

21
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,541
And what would you buy
with that, Cheval?

22
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:56,583
I'd buy... a pot.

23
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,208
[LILIA]
A pot?

24
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,458
My mom's old one
is falling apart.

25
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:01,750
So that's my choice.

26
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:05,041
I'd buy her a nice
new cook pot.

27
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:10,458
Yeah. Good plan. A pot
just for making donuts!

28
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,416
Are you almost done?

29
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,750
Man, I'm so hungry.

30
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:18,541
So what would you'd buy
with 500 Zenny, Lute?

31
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:21,958
Ah, let me think.
I could go for a soufflé.

32
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,416
No, wait, I want
a well-done steak.

33
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,750
Umm... But that soufflé.

34
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,500
Argh! I can't decide!

35
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:32,666
Of course, you would spend all
that money gorging yourself.

36
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,500
What is this thing
that costs 500 Zenny?

37
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:36,791
A Golden Egg.

38
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,875
Or to shorten it. I say--

39
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,208
That's short enough!

40
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,166
Or for short...

41
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,791
[LUTE, NAVIROU]
...we say Glegg!

42
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:47,083
That's even more ridiculous
than I expected.

43
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,416
[CHEVAL] Hey, Mom, have you
ever heard of a Golden Egg?

44
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,833
[VLAU]
Yes, a little.

45
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,708
From what I remember, it's
a gold-colored Gargwa egg

46
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,458
that they only lay under
rare circumstances.

47
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,208
It's supposedly the
highest-grade egg

48
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,750
found in nature.

49
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,750
That means it's equal parts
nutritious as well as tasty.

50
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,458
You think I'd be
able to find one?

51
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:05,416
[VLAU] Oh, honey, I doubt it.
Like I said, they're very rare.

52
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,250
Oh. 'Kay.

53
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,375
Is that what you wanted to know?

54
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,958
Yeah, thanks.

55
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,000
[CHIEF OMNA]
Cheval, I want you to meet Lute.

56
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,500
I expect you boys to play
nice with each other.

57
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:20,208
Hi. It's very nice
to meet you, Lute.

58
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,375
It's nice to meet you, Cheval.

59
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:26,166
Uh, Mom. I'm heading out.

60
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,541
[CHEVAL]
I'm not having any luck.

61
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,166
[LUTE]
Cheval!

62
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,916
Hey, Lute, what's going on?

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,625
Don't tell me you lost a donut!

64
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:42,250
Uh. No, I'm not out here
'cause I lost a donut.

65
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,916
Oh! Wait, I know!

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,166
Cheval's on the hunt
for Dos Hercules larvae!

67
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,750
No, that's not it.

68
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,208
Then what is it?

69
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,666
Well, uh, don't laugh, but...

70
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,125
...I want a Golden Egg.

71
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,416
A Golden Egg?

72
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,750
Oh! Oh, yeah, a Glegg!

73
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,041
That's why you're
out here alone,

74
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,958
slinking around all secret-like.

75
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,833
Well, I guess. You're right.

76
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,541
Great! Then I'll look with you!

77
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,125
The winner's whoever
finds one first!

78
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,125
I'm ready to get that egg!

79
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:19,583
Gargwa! Gargwa! Gargwa!

80
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,958
What are you doing?

81
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,208
I'm trying to attract a Gargwa!

82
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,166
If we can't find a Golden
Egg lying around,

83
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,958
we need a Gargwa
to lay one for us.

84
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,875
Gargwa! Gargwa! Gargwa! Gargwa!

85
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,458
Wow, Lute.

86
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,958
You actually put some real
thought into this plan.

87
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,875
Join me for the Gargwa call!

88
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,291
[CHEVAL]
Sure!

89
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:42,750
[LUTE, CHEVAL]
Gargwa! Gargwa! Gargwa! Gargwa!

90
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:48,291
Gargwa! Gargwa! Gargwa! Gargwa!

91
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,875
What are they doing?

92
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:53,375
Maybe they decided to give up
the Rider thing and goof around.

93
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,208
[LUTE, CHEVAL]
Gargwa! Gargwa! Gargwa! Gargwa!

94
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,833
[LUTE]
Ooh! Dibs on that donut!

95
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,375
[LUTE yelps]

96
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:02,083
Jeez, why are you always
so stingy, Navirou?

97
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,625
Navirou is not stingy.

98
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:07,416
This donut does not desire to be
eaten by anyone but Navirou!

99
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,875
Donuts have their own instincts,
and Navirou respects them.

100
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,500
[LUTE] What about your
best friend's instinct

101
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,416
to eat the donut?

102
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,916
Don't you respect that?

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,333
And eating it will give me
extra energy for my Gargwa call.

104
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,666
Then we can get our
hands on that Golden Egg!

105
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,166
A Golden Egg, huh?
Oh, Navirou understands.

106
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,250
You're searching for
the fabled Glegg.

107
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,500
[LUTE] Yep! That's why we're
trying to attract Gargwa!

108
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,208
All we have to do
is yell "Gargwa!"

109
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,583
and one's bound to show up
that we can get an egg from!

110
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:34,541
Gar--

111
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,958
[CHEVAL]
Shh!

112
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,250
[LUTE] Our Gargwa call
must've lured it here.

113
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,041
What's wrong, Cheval, why're
you so quiet all of the--?

114
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:52,083
[CHEVAL yelling]

115
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,166
Hey! What the heck was that?

116
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,166
You scared away our only Gargwa!

117
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,250
What? Oh, you didn't know?

118
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,958
A Gargwa will only lay an
egg if it's been startled.

119
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,958
Oh, wow, okay.

120
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,541
Well, either way,
it doesn't matter

121
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,625
because we got stuck
with a plain ol' egg.

122
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,541
I guess my
Gargwa-startling abilities

123
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,083
still need a little work.

124
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,750
You scared the donuts
off Navirou's body!

125
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,208
The secret stash is no more!

126
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,666
Oh, wait, three-second rule.

127
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,500
I'd still eat 'em even
with a 300 second rule!

128
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,416
Mine!

129
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,125
[NAVIROU]
Ah! No, my stash.

130
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:29,958
[LUTE]
Too late!

131
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,291
Give 'em back!

132
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,166
[LUTE] Where were you
hiding these, anyway?

133
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,250
[NAVIROU]
Not telling!

134
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,541
[LUTE]
Look, I just want you to share!

135
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,875
[NAVIROU]
Absolutely not!

136
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,458
Don't be so stingy.

137
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,958
[LUTE yells]

138
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,250
My babies!

139
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,041
[LUTE, NAVIROU]
No, wait!

140
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,250
[CHEVAL groans]

141
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,000
[NAVIROU screams]

142
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,833
Navirou's donuts!

143
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,083
What's become of
Navirou's precious?

144
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,208
Little guys were so young!

145
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,250
This is all your fault!

146
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,791
[LUTE]
Uh.

147
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,083
[NAVIROU] And to add insult to
injury, there's one missing!

148
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,375
Calm down, it just flew
behind that rock.

149
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,291
[NAVIROU]
Behind what rock?

150
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,791
[CHEVAL, NAVIROU gasp]

151
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,125
[CHEVAL, NAVIROU]
A Golden Egg!

152
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,750
I'm so happy. We found one!

153
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,458
Yep! Our Glegg quest
was a big success!

154
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,958
Listen up, you two.

155
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,416
You only found it

156
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,375
thanks to Navirou's always
helpful "lost donut radar"!

157
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,833
[LUTE]
Yeah, whatever.

158
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,166
[CHEVAL]
Hold on.

159
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,583
That old lady looks like
she could use a hand.

160
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:29,958
I'm gonna go help her.

161
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,625
[LUTE] Take your time.
We'll guard the egg for ya!

162
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,208
[CHEVAL] Oh. Thanks,
Lute. Just don't drop it.

163
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,416
I mean, you know that,
obviously, of course.

164
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,333
[LUTE]
Don't worry, I got it.

165
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,625
[CHEVAL]
There, how's that?

166
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,208
[WOMAN A] Much better.
It almost feels light!

167
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,708
Glad to hear it. I think this
should work for the time being.

168
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:52,000
Thank you, young man.
You've made my day brighter.

169
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:56,500
Happy to do it, ma'am.
Be careful. Go slow and steady.

170
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,958
Well, I'll see ya!

171
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:02,416
[WOMAN A] My, what a
sweet young boy he is.

172
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,416
[CHEVAL]
Hey. Sorry to keep you waiting.

173
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,583
Cheval.

174
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,541
Surprise!

175
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,375
A cook pot?

176
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,416
Lilia wasn't joking.

177
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,541
That egg really was
worth 500 Zenny!

178
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,375
There's a ton left over
even after buying this pot!

179
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,875
Here, look!

180
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,500
Wait. Hold on. Does
that mean that you...?

181
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,500
You sold the Golden Egg?

182
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:26,916
That's right!

183
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,250
But why would you...?

184
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,250
Hey, you said it yourself, pal!

185
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,416
My mom's old one
is falling apart.

186
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,791
So that's my choice.

187
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,916
I'd buy her a nice
new cook pot.

188
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,583
So I sold the Glegg and bought
the best one I could find!

189
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:41,833
Wow, Lute.

190
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,166
I'm kinda surprised you
remembered what I said.

191
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,541
Of course!

192
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,875
Well, thanks. I guess.

193
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:52,500
There's no need to
thank me! Eh? Huh?

194
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,500
Shouldn't you be smiling more?

195
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,708
Was there something
else that you wanted?

196
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,875
No. It's not that.

197
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,583
[LUTE]
Hmm. Well, what is it then?

198
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,250
Don't forget, you've got all
this change left from the sale.

199
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,708
If you don't like this,
you can still buy whatever.

200
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,500
So what're you gonna get?

201
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,000
[LUTE chuckles nervously]

202
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,000
Nothing.

203
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,750
I didn't wanna sell the Golden
Egg. I wanted to keep it.

204
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,041
[LUTE gasps]

205
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:21,291
Wait, are you sure?
I had no idea. I'm sorry!

206
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,958
Well, it's fine.

207
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,541
No, it's not fine!

208
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:31,041
Why didn't you tell me
as soon as we found it?

209
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:34,583
I'm not a mind-reader, Cheval.
You gotta speak up.

210
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,916
[CHEVAL] Do I have to
tell you everything?

211
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,083
I have my own thoughts
about a lotta things.

212
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:46,125
Do I...? Do I have to run every
single one of them past you?

213
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,625
Huh? What're you
getting at, Cheval?

214
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:53,958
[CHEVAL]
Uh, I don't know. It's fine.

215
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,000
[LUTE]
Uh.

216
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,083
Stop saying that
when it's not true!

217
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,958
There's stll time
to make things right.

218
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,291
I'm getting that egg back!

219
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,750
Lute, wait!

220
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,958
[LUTE] Excuse me, ma'am!
Remember that egg?

221
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,666
Yes! Thank you for
selling it to me.

222
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,458
I just turned it around and
sold it for big money myself.

223
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,208
What? You already sold it?

224
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,166
To who? Give us a name!

225
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,708
Mister Kometa bought it.

226
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,375
I just saw him leaving
the village, actually.

227
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,708
Thanks!

228
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,125

Mister Kometa! Hold up!

233
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,041
[MISTER KOMETA]
Huh?

234
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,541
Oh, hi, Cheval!

235
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,791
Mister Kometa, can you
please give me back

236
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,666
the Golden Egg you just bought?

237
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,916
Please, sir. I'm begging you!

238
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,666
Huh? Oh.

239
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,541
Son, I'd be happy to give you
back the egg if I still had it,

240
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,583
but see, I just ran
into Chief Omna...

241
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,333
Chief Omna, are you in here?

242
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,083
[CHIEF OMNA]
Hm?

243
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,125
[gasps]

244
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,291
Oh, great! You found it!

245
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,625
No, we're too late.

246
00:11:58,708 --> 00:11:59,958
[LUTE]
Huh?

247
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,875
[CHIEF OMNA]
Oh!

248
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,583
Now doesn't that
look scrumptious?

249
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,083
Golden eggs are
so healthy for you,

250
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:12,041
they can even help turn back
the ravages of Father Time!

251
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,458
Give you the smooth hands
of a young man again.

252
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,958
So how do you like your eggs?
Fried or over-easy?

253
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,750
Hello? Where'd they go?

254
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,583
Man, if only we'd been a
little faster getting there.

255
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,125
And what's with him
and the skin care?

256
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,916
I mean, he can eat all
the Golden Eggs he wants,

257
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,125
I doubt it changes the fact
that he looks like a prune.

258
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,166
Hey. Now what's wrong?

259
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,750
Hold up, Cheval!

260
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:40,208
Wow. I guess you really wanted
to eat that Golden Egg, huh?

261
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,500
I know, we'll run
back to Chief Omna

262
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,458
and grab a bite
before it gets cold.

263

It's so big, you'll
still get your fill!

Right? C'mon, Cheval!

265
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,500
I don't know what you're
thinking when you're quiet!

It's fine.

What do you mean, "not really"?

to say, just say it!

to me, and now Ratha.

something nice for Cheval.

What? He wanted the egg for me?

00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,833
Well, actually he wanted
the egg to cook with,

292
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,083
but only so he could
use his mom's recipe

293
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,750
to make a special golden
soufflé just for you.

I never would've expected that.

295
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,500
Navirou's so disappointed in you

giving away that hard-won
egg for a handful of cash.

297
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,041
What do you want me to say?
I didn't know any of this!

298
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,333
Maybe next time you should
try to "read the room."

299
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,166
We weren't in a room, Lilia!

300
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,375
Even if we were,
there was nothing to read!

301

You don't know what
that means, do you?

302
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,416
It would've been much easier

303
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,791
if he had just told me what
was going on, you know?

304
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,500
We're talking about Cheval here.

305
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,458
I'm sure he only kept it a
secret so he could surprise you.

00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:32,625
Uh.

excited at the thought

of seeing you that happy.

You lack delicacy
in these situations.

You're also really bad

decency, privacy,
and emergencies.

313

No currency, intimacy, fluency,
or experience with candidacies!

I'm home.

00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:59,000
Cheval. So how'd it go
out there? You find one?

319
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,500
What? No, no egg.

320
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,875
Oh, too bad. You wanted to
cook something with it, right?

321
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,875
Maybe a very special meal
for your best friend, Lute?

322
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,416
Like a golden soufflé?

Huh? How'd you know that's
what I wanted to do?

Thank you, Cheval.

Oh, and do you know
where Lute ran off?

328
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,250
Uh, he was with me earlier,
but I had to leave.

329
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,041
Well, he's late.

Usually he's here by now.

As soon as that stomach
of his starts growling,

he always comes rushing back.

Hey, guys, what's up?
Where's Lute?

335
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,708
I think that he
might be in trouble.

Uh. What are you talking about?

337

Lute went into the woods
and hasn't come back.

Well, um. Please don't be
angry with me, Cheval.

I'm sorry. I told him
what you told me.

he went off alone

Now it's time to form a
Kinship with our Monsties!

475
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:54,041
The moment of new life.

476
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,375
Awaken!

477
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:01,875
[NAVIROU]
Our Monstie this time is: Popo!

478
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:04,791
These big boys have a thick coat
of fur to keep the cold away,

479
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,708
while they spend
their days grazing.

480
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,666
Popo are normally
calm and gentle,

481
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,041
but when push comes
to shove, watch out!

482
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,958
They're the perfect kind
of Monstie for Stone!

483
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:17,958
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!

484
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,291
[LUTE]
Hey, Lute here!

485
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,375
Those mischievous twins
Den-Den and Lin-Lin

486
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,541
are really making
life difficult!

487
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:26,875
Hey, not that way!
There's a Gypceros over there!

488
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:28,958
Next time:
"Like Mom Used to Make"!

489
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,541
Ride On!
