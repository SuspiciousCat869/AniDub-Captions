Are you sure you've
thought this all through?

just moping around.

She'd want me to go
make a difference.

That's what I'll do.

Now listen up!

These young Riders are leaving

to help secure a future
for Hakum Village.

Go on!

I shoulda asked permission
before eating the donuts

that you stashed under the bed.

It's not like you to stay
this quiet, Navirou.

Did you eat something
you weren't supposed to?

This has nothing
to do with food!

It's just so scary out there.

People might target us just
'cause we're Riders.

And there might be

far beyond your years.

Your courage has
been an inspiration

and has helped us honor the past
while looking to the future.

you have shown great kindness.

You can easily sense
the pain in others.

Of your many strengths,
this empathy impresses me most.

it in your heart.

Know these swords are yours.

319
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,958
However, only draw them
to defend yourself,

320

a friend, or your Kinship.
