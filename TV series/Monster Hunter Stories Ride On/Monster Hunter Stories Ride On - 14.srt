where Navirou

326
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,875
teaches you about Monsties.

327
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,916
Now then, Navirou hopes you have

328
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,166
your Media Trigger Smart
Phone app open for this.

329
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,500
And get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

330
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:51,875
Now it's time to form a
Kinship with our Monsties!

331
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:54,000
The moment of new life!

332
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:56,208
Awaken!

333
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:03,000
[NAVIROU] Our Monstie
this time is: Aptonoth!

334
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,708
These gentle herbivores
raise their young in herds,

335
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:08,166
so they're twice as
cautious as any human.

336
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,875
Did you notice how
Mille's Aptonoth

337
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:12,875
was the first to pick up
on that Nargacuga?

338
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:17,791
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!

339
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,041
[LUTE]
Hey! Lute here!

340
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,375
It's finally time for us
to leave Hakum Village

341
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,500
and venture into
the outside world.

342
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:25,916
I'm super excited to
see what's out there!

343
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,291
Okay, everybody, we're off!

344
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,458
Next time: "The Journey Begins"!

345
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,958
Ride On!
