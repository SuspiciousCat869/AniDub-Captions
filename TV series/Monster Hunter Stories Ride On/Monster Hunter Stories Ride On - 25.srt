1
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:09,291
[NARRATOR]
These young folks are Riders,

2
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:12,291
who form Kinship with Monsties.

3
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:15,083
A Blighted Diablos has
attacked Albrachs Village,

4
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:17,125
home of their Hunter
friend, Reverto.

5
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:20,500
Now they've come to see the
devastation with their own eyes.

6
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,625
This is just terrible.

7
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:25,458
Mister.

8
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,583
Where is it?

9
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:31,125
Where's the Diablos?

10
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:32,958
What about the people?

11
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,833
I heard the Hunter's Guild
took them all in as refugees.

12
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,416
Good, they're safe.

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,458
Yeah, I hope, but...

14
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,916
So this is the Black Blight.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,583
[NARRATOR]
Will they ever be able to stop

16
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,666
this rampaging beast?

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,041
All right, let's go find it.

18
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,083
Yeah!

19
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,083
I'll look for tracks!

20
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,375
Better if we split up.

21
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,708
Right!

22
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,791
Mister?

23
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,250
Go with him, boys.

24
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,625
He's got that ol'
Hunter's intuition.

25
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,625
[NAVIROU] Like Navirou's
sense of direction.

26
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,000
[REVERTO]
Hey, Lute!

27
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,875
We'll start up there!

28
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:22,125
This tree was practically
the source of all life here.

29
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,583
[REVERTO] For centuries, the
people of Alrbachs Village

30
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:37,625
drew vitality from this tree,
and flourished in its shade.

31
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,000
But now it's dead and dry.

32
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,458
Just like the village around it.

33
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,291
Hey, mister, is it true?

34
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,375
There's a glowing
stone here, right?

35
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:51,708
Yeah, that's right. There's
one in the forest up ahead.

36
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,916
How'd you know that, Lute?

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,625
Chief Nolma told us about it.

38
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,958
There's a light!

39
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,666
Despite everything,
the stone is still glowing,

40
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,208
but the question is, how bright?

41
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,041
I saw it first!

42
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,166
Kinship Ore!

43
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,291
So they really do have one.

44
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,875
So "Kinship Ore"'s
what Riders call it?

45
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,166
[HAYORO]
Mh-hm.

46
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,666
It's full of black splotches.

47
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,875
It's not the same as
the last time I saw it.

48
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,916
Did it used to
glow more brightly?

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,375
It was so bright,
it'd hurt your eyes.

50
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:36,333
It's clouding over like the
other Kinship Ore we saw.

51
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,791
[MILLE, HYORO]
Yeah.

52
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,375
Reverto?

53
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,625
Oh, Chief Nolma!

54
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,750
[CHIEF NOLMA]
It's good to have you back.

55
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:44,916
This is--

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,125
[LUTE]
Uh.

57
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,666
We met the children
at the camp in Oasum.

58
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,166
I know they're just kids,
but these are great Riders, sir.

59
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,166
Navirou is a great Navirou!

60
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,416
Indeed. We saw their skills
on display in the desert.

61
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,375
We have no quarrel
with the Rider's actions.

62
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,500
But the fact is, monsters
are the bounty of the land,

63
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,208
not to be used as tools.

64
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,250
We're not just using them!

65
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,250
Navirou will have you know
that they form Kinship!

66
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,833
How dare you
disrespect his pupils.

67
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,333
We're nothing like
those weirdoes

68
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,625
and their mechanized Barroth,

69
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,875
so just back off, all right?

70
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:22,541
They're good kids, Chief,
and they're Riders we can trust.

71
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:26,333
Reverto, I wish I could
trust you blindly on this,

72
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,708
but I need to know why you're
so willing to back them up.

73
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,875
I've seen them in action.
That's the reason.

74
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,166
It seems like such a leap.

75
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:44,083
These are Riders, huh.

76
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,583
Give 'em a chance, all right?

77
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:49,166
I guarantee these kids
will earn your trust.

Don't forget that, Mille.

I've seen your power.

This purification
was only possible

174
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:23,875
because your hearts can form a
genuine Kinship with monsters.

What's up, Dan?

We're gonna head back
to Hakum Village, now.

Would you like to come with us?

I think I'll stay out here

Me and Ratha.

Okay. So then, it's
goodbye for now, Lute.

Don't do anything too dangerous.

You grew up together,
closer than brothers.

I guess my brother's
thrown in with Cheval, too.

Then let's go see if that
Ore's turning black, too!

Even if it is bad news,

Captain Simone says
there's no doubt.

241
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,833
We must purify the Kinship Ore.

242
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,208
They're the source
of the Black Blight

to stop its spread.

on top of this one.

Cheval, this is just
the beginning, I promise!

Glad to hear it.

But still, I'll keep
finding Blighted monsters

Even as we speak,
they could be rampaging

something about my village?

Your old village was right
next to Hakum Village,

so when the Blighted
monster attacked,

we sent many Riders
over to help.

your father and Lute's
became close friends.

...with a firm and
mighty handshake.

They're very gratful
to all of the Riders.

327
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,125
They'll never forget it.

328
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,500
I know!

329
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,375
He's got his own way
to stop the Blight.

330
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:23,041
[LUTE] I don't like it, but I
won't stand in his way.

331
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,666
Because...

332
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,166
One day, this'll be over

333
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,750
and things'll go back
to how they were.

334
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,333
I feel the same way!

335
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,541
Yeah!

336
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,791
[NAVIROU]
Oh, yeah. It'll happen.

337
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,375
Thanks, guys.

338
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,208
Hey, that's my Well-Done Steak!

339
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:49,291
Ratha, there may not've
been a Kinship Rite

340
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,375
that made me and
Cheval best friends.

341
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,625
But it still felt like
something bigger bound us.

342
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,958
That feeling, that's why
you remembered me, right?

343
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,583
Why you're back?

344
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:07,416
He'll understand one day.

345
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,750
The Kinship we share
can never be broken.

346
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,166
[DR. MANELGER,
ITSY-BITS yelling]

347
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,416
Hello! Your name is
Cheval, correct?

348
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,375
Behold, Dr. Manelger!

349
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,500
And his assistant, Itsy-Bits!

350
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,208
[DR. MANELGER]
We hereby extend an invitation

351
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,166
for you to work with us!

352
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,583
That's a little sudden,
don'tcha think?

353
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,750
Once in my company,

354
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,958
I guarantee you'll
become even stronger.

355
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,666
Stopping the Blight
will be easy.

356
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,875
Let's go, Cheval. These
guys give me the creeps.

357
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,083
No thanks.

358
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,458
We'll be doing things
our way from now on.

359
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,083
[DR. MANELGER]
You're passing up the best

360
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:57,125
and only chance you'll
get to stop the Blight.

361
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:04,125
Join with me, boy,
and save the whole world!

362
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,583
The world!

363
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,666
This is all so important,
he said it twice!

364
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,125
And I'll tell you
this a second time--

365
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:14,541
we have our way of doing this,
and it doesn't include you.

366
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,916
[DR. MANELGER] Hmm.
An unfortunate decision.

367
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,500
[CHEVAL] The Black Blight will
be stopped... by my hand.

368
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,500
[NAVIROU]
<i>Monstie Manual</i> !

369
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,416
Here comes the part
where Navirou

370
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,916
tells you about Monsties.

371
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,916
All right, Navirou
hopes you have

372
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,166
your Media Trigger
Smart Phone app open.

373
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,541
Better get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

374
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:51,625
And now, it's time to form
a Kinship with our Monsties!

375
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:53,708
The moment of new life!

376
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:56,041
Awaken!

377
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:02,708
[NAVIROU] Our Monstie
this time is: Diablos!

378
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:05,833
The tyrant of the desert is
known for its raw power.

379
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:08,125
Diablos burrow through
the sand to sneak up

380
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:11,000
and attack prey
with two huge horns!

381
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,916
It's terrifying!

382
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,791
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!

383
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,125
[LUTE]
Hey, guys, Lute here!

384
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,208
Sounds like Debli's
old teacher Nedan

385
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,625
knows quite a bit
about the Redan legend.

386
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:27,750
I wonder if he's got any
clues that might help us. Hmm.

387
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:30,458
Next time: "The
Mysterious White Dragon."

388
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,958
Ride On!
