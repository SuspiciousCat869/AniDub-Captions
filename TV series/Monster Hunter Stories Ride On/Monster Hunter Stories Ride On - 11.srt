[LUTE]
Lilia! There's a letter for you!

2
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:12,291
[BOTH]
Huh?

3
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:15,708
C'mon, Lute, hold up!
Hey, wait for me, Lute!

4
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,458
Lilia! You got a letter!

5
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:21,458
Mama and Papa brought
it back here for you!

6
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:25,708
It's from Simone! You know,
Captain of the Scriveners!

7
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,333
Simone wrote to me?

8
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,541
Here ya go!

9
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,458
[NARRATOR]
This young boy's name is Lute,

10
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:34,458
a rash, but enthusiastic fellow
who dreams of becoming

11
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,250
the world's top Monster Rider.

12
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,208
He's still just an apprentice,

13
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,208
but Navirou is doing a
great job training him!

14
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:45,750
Wow, a letter from
Simone for me!

15
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,333
[NARRATOR]
Instead of becoming a Rider,

16
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:50,166
skilled combiner Lilia is
pursuing her own dream.

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,416
She wants nothing more than
to explore the outside world.

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Good for you, Lilia.

19
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:59,166
Getting a letter from your
role model's a big deal.

20
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,458
[NARRATOR] Cheval is also
an apprentice Rider,

21
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:02,791
just like Lute.

22
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,583
The two of them have
grown up together,

23
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,666
raised like brothers.

24
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,708
Simone says she's very concerned

25
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:11,041
about the Hakum Gale
incident we experienced.

26
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,666
[LUTE] Oh, right. That wind
the other day was crazy!

27
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,833
You can say that again.

28
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:17,375
I'd never seen the
Gale blow so fiercely.

29
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,041
I'm going to investigate
the Hakum Gale,

30
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:25,958
write up a full report,
and send it to Simone!

31
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,000
Come on, let me
have one of those.

32
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,250
Yeah, I'd like one, too.

33
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,833
Navirou's donuts are for
Navirou's mouth only!

34
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,416
He shares 'em with no one!

35
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,041
And that's a Navi-rule.

36
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,250
[TWINS laughing]

37
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,250
So weird!

38
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,666
So weird!

39
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,541
But my mom is the one
who gave them to you.

40
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:43,791
[LILIA] Uh, hello, guys,
are you even listening to me?

41
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,083
No. No, we're not.

42
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,500
[NAVIROU]
Hey, you can't just take that!

43
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:47,541
Sorry.

44
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,541
[sighs]

45
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,291
Anyway, there's a lot
I'd like to find out

46
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,708
about the Hakum Gale.

47
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,750
Because I'm curious,

48
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,916
and because I think it'd be
pretty cool to help out Simone.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,500
You should come with me!

50
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,583
I can gather some combo
ingredients along the way.

51
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:03,833
Well?

52
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,583
Well?

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,375
[LILIA]
All right, then away we go!

54
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,958
Be careful out there,
Navirou. Don't get lost!

55
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,333
Yeah, don't get lost!

56
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,666
--[NAVIROU growls]
--[TWINS laugh]

57
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,833
[LUTE] I bet Lilia's gonna
find something gross

58
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,708
to mix up for us again.

59
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,208
[NAVIROU] Oh yeah, and then
she'll make us drink it.

60
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:27,250
Something that tastes bitter,
like life itself!

61
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,750
Hey, best of luck
out there, Lute!

62
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:29,875
I hope you have a good time!

63
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,416
[TWINS]
Go get 'em! Go get 'em!

[TWINS laughing]

00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,291
All right, you're on
Lilia's drink duty, got it?

66
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,666
Uh! Wait, what? Why me?
Couldn't you just--?

67
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,666
[LUTE]
Nope.

68
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,250
[CHEVAL]
That was fast!

69
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,708
[GAMIGAMI] What in the blazes
is going on out there

70
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:49,833
in those woods nowadays?

71
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,375
It's all very troubling.

72
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,708
Not to mention that
strange Hakum Gale.

73
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,416
We can't just ignore it.

74
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,375
It's frightening.

75
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:00,916
Reminds me of the
situation 12 years ago.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,416
Yes, indeed.

77
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,291
Chief Omna, would you like me
to go check out the woods?

78
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,916
I'll be heading out
there myself later.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,208
It's absolutely vital right
now that we split up

80
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,333
and learn as much as we can
about the state of the woods.

81
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,625
Yes.

82
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,250
And if we observe anything
out of the ordinary,

83
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,375
we'll let you know right away.

84

[VLAU]
Here are your lunches.

85
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,041
And I made sure to throw in
plenty of donuts for you, too.

00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,208
[LUTE, NAVIROU]
Yeah!

00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,291
Thank you, Mrs. Vlau!

88
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,041
Cheval, take care not
to get lost, all right?

89
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,166
And I don't want you to do
anything dangerous now,

do you hear me?

00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,875
Yeah, yeah. Sheesh, Mom,
I know all of that.

You say the same thing
every time I leave.

Oh.

Oh, well, I guess I do!
Sorry to repeat myself.

I'm just worried about
the Hakum Gale, that's all.

talking about you.

soup waiting for you!

than they were before?

Yeah.

Huh, I don't like
the looks of this.

place even smells different,

There must be some Felyne
ladies out in the wild.

such a popular Felyne!

Pretty snazzy, huh?

Maybe we'll find some answers

to what's behind that
terrible Hakum Gale.

trees are turning black.

Huh? What the--?

The woods didn't used
to be like this.

129

[CHEVAL] Right. It's gotten
much darker somehow.

[LILIA] Look, it's completely
pitch-black in places.

131

Yeah, it's almost as
black as Navirou's heart.

132
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:29,333
For your information,
Navirou is not black-hearted!

He's just shifty!

It's starting to feel
a little scary now.

There's gotta be
something causing this.

00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,458
Did you say something?

160
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,833
Nope, nothing.

161
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,083
I hope you know how
lucky you are, Cheval.

162
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,500
It must be pretty
nice getting to eat

163
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,708
this delicious food every day!

164
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,125
Yeah, I am.

165
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,250
She really puts her heart
into everything she makes.

166
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,541
Always thinking, "May everyone
enjoy a tasty meal."

167
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:48,708
That's right!

168
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,166
You must really love
your mom, Cheval.

169
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,416
I can tell from how
you talk about her.

170
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,541
Not that I've ever
bothered to say that to her.

171
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,583
Thanks for everything, Mom.

172
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,625
It's gotten worse
since the last time

173
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,041
we came here to look around.

174
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,250
You're right.

175
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,416
Wow, this place has
gotten kind of creepy.

176
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,875
Look at the Forbidden Land.
It's pretty far gone, too.

177
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,625
I think Lute, Cheval,
and Lilia are out here.

178
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,833
I mean here in the woods.

179
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:21,875
[MILLE]
They are?

180
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,125
What makes you think that?

181
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,083
Well, they were talking
about it this morning.

182
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,833
[GENIE] You have to tell
us these things, Hyoro!

183
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,250
[HYORO]
Sorry.

184
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,833
Well, let's just hope
that those guys

185
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,625
are staying far away
from the Forbidden Land.

186
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,208
So how much farther, Lilia?

187
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,125
It seems like there's
more and more blackness

188
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,875
as we go deeper into the woods.

189
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,041
It worries me.

190
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,125
Yeah, but the Forbidden
Land is up ahead.

191
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,500
Huh, we did kinda stumble
into it once before, I guess.

192
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,166
That's right,
and Navirou recalls

193
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,625
how his expert navigation
skills got us home safely!

194
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,166
In your dreams!

195
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,333
Sheesh, it was your fault we
wound up in the Forbidden Land

196
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,833
in the first place!

197
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,375
Though I did find Ratha's egg
when we were lost in there,

198
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,833
so maybe the whole thing
wasn't a total waste.

199
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:02,958
Ha!

200
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,291
So what you're saying is,

201
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,916
you should always do what
Navirou tells you to do!

202
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,166
Hey, wait a second,

203
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,750
wasn't that big statue
around here somewhere?

204
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:10,916
Oh, yeah, right.

205
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It kinda looked like
Navirou, didn't it?

206
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,458
Sure did.

That intense gaze is back again!

All right, guys,
which path should we take?

219
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,083
I'd really like to get
to the bottom of this

220
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,208
and figure out what's causing
the grass to turn black

221
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,333
so I can let Simone know.

222
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,541
Which way?

223
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,625
[NAVIROU, LUTE]
That way!

224
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,750
That way it is!

225
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,375
Why don't you ever trust

[yells]

Feels like we already
did that before,

232
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,250
and once was more than enough.

233
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,125
[LUTE]
There's that ugly statue!

234
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,500
And what did I say? It's the
spitting image of Navirou!

235
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,916
[CHEVAL]
Really is pretty ugly, isn't it?

Oh, right, there's that mural!

What does all that writing say?

Let's see.

240
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,166
It's old writing,
so I can't be sure,

241
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,916
but I have a strong feeling

242
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,208
that these words here
must be pretty important.

The same thing that brought you.

Concern about that

for you youngsters to
learn what it signifies.

much the same way the woods
are turning black now,

A spike. It must've
fallen out of its tail.

Although ordinarily such a spike
would never be that color.

Just like the trees here,

It happened the very year

As I understand the situation,
your father perished

Your mother, too,
did everything she could

to keep her newborn son safe
from the Nargacuga's attack,

I may not be a Rider,

about this Black Blight,

Well, there's one thing
you mustn't forget.

390

It's not the Blight-afflicted

that they're acting this way.

They aren't evil.

No, the real villain here
is the Black Blight itself,

which has been driving them mad.

We must not resent
these monsters,

00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,875
these honey fiends make
for adorable Monsties!

478
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:11,833
Also, its well-developed
forearms are so powerful

479
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,875
it can even catch fish!

480
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:17,541
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!

481
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:19,000
[LUTE]
Hey, guys! Lute here!

482
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,291
So it's shown up at last

483
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,541
and Hakum Village
is in serious trouble!

484
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,583
But don't worry, Lilia,
because Ratha and I

485
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,666
are gonna run that thing
right outta town!

486
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,958
Just you watch!

487
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:30,583
Next time:
"Invasion of the Nargacuga"!

488
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:31,958
Ride On!
