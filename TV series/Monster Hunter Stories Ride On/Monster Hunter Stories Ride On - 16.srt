1
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,916
The outside world.

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,750
[NARRATOR]
This young boy's name is Lute,

3
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,625
a rash but enthusiastic fellow,

4
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:22,041
who dreams of becoming the
world's top Monster Rider.

5
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:25,625
Along with his friends, Lute is
leaving Hakum Village behind

6
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:29,000
and venturing out into
the great wide world.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,250
Ratha has to be out there.

8
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,916
He has to be; I'm sure of it!

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,166
Yeah, along with some tasty
donuts we've never tried before!

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,000
[BOTH]
Let's go find 'em!

11
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,041
First we have to
go to Gildegaran,

12
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,666
where Captain Simone is.

13
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,250
Let's head out!

14
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,791
[wheezing]

15
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,541
Hey, Hyoro, are you all right?

16
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,083
I think so...

17
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:02,666
It's easy to get lost
around here, so stay close.

18
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,541
[LILIA] They say that
in the Sea of Trees,

19
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,291
if you get lost, you'll lose
all sense of direction

20
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,083
and never find your
way out again.

21
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,500
[squeals]

22
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,041
Okay, no matter what,
I'm gonna stay right with you.

23
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,500
Oh, come on.

24
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,375
Jeez, Hyoro, you're
always slowing us down.

25
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,875
So, Mille, even after
all this walking,

26
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,958
we still have a long,
long way to go, right?

27
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,166
Yeah, of course we do.
It's a journey.

28
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,000
Then that means, we have
to camp out here at night?

29
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,208
Yeah, of course we do.
It's a journey.

30
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,166
And camping means that
we have to sleep outside,

31
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,583
isn't that right?

32
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,333
Yes, of course we do. Why are
you asking all this now?

33
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:42,166
Well, I... I've never been
outside Hakum Village before.

34
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,708
And there's no telling
what we might encounter.

35
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,833
Yeah, that's right,
which is the whole reason

36
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,666
why Chief Omna gave us
these things, remember?

37
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,583
Uh, sure I do, but--

38
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,750
[LUTE] Besides, it'll be
fun camping together!

39
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,416
Sleeping under the stars.

40
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,458
Right, Cheval?

41
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,875
[CHEVAL]
Yeah.

42
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:01,083
Lute's got a point.
A journey should be enjoyed.

43
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,291
Uh-huh!

44
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,833
The outside world
is one of freedom,

45
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,583
with no rules to tie us down!

46
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,250
Which means that we can eat
as many donuts as we want,

47
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,958
whenever we want!

48
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,041
Ah! No fair!
You're eating again?

49
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,916
Slow down. We have a ways to go.

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,291
You shouldn't eat
them all at once.

51
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:22,166
Whenever someone asks
why Navirou eats donuts,

52
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,791
he always answers,
"Because the donuts are there!"

53
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,166
And that's a Navi-rule.

54
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,750
[stomach growls]

55
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:34,625
Uh. Guess I must be getting
kinda hungry myself.

56
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,166
Oh, thank goodness!

57
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,208
I didn't wanna say anything,

58
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,750
but I've been starving
this whole time!

59
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,125
Gosh, you guys are too much.

60
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,416
But I guess a short break--

61
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,208
[LUTE, HYORO]
All right! Let's chow down!

62
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,166
Yum!

63
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,750
Well-Done Steak is great!

64
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:09,000
Ahh... I'm completely stuffed!

65
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,250
That oughta get us through
the rest of the day.

66
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,333
Huh? Wait, but how much longer
do we still have to walk today?

67
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,416
Until the sun goes
down, of course.

68
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,583
[HYORO groans]

69
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,916
I knew it.

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,041
But look, the Arctic
Ridge is right up ahead.

71
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,458
It won't be easy.
We have to be prepared.

72
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,125
[LILIA chuckles]

73
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,833
Luckily, I've been saving
a special drink I mixed up,

74
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,625
just for this occasion.

75
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,375
You see? It's a
batch of Hot Drink!

76
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,750
[LILIA] One sip of this will
warm your body right up!

77
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,791
You won't even feel the cold!

78
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,583
Here, go on, drink!

79
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:49,541
What do we do?

80
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,750
I don't think I can drink it.

81
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:52,875
Who's up first?

82
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:53,875
Draw numbers?

00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,458
Guess it's the only way.

84
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,541
Uh, what's going on guys?

85
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:01,000
We're about to take our lives
into our own hands here!

Ready, go!

Oh, fine. This is how
I live my life--boldly!

Uh, yeah. Navirou's gonna pass.

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,333
Hey, wait. I think it's working.

95
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,916
I feel warmer now.

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,708
Whoa, you're right!
It's amazing!

97
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,458
That's our Lilia!

98
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:44,208
Although, wouldn't it be more
amazing if it tasted better?

99
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,666
[chuckles]

100
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,125
We'll stay nice and toasty
in the frigid Arctic Ridge,

101
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,125
even if there's a
blizzard up there.

102
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:53,375
The only thing left is to make
sure we have enough food to eat.

103
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:56,291
Yeah, well, that's the
part that has me worried.

104
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,208
Some way, somehow,
we really are

105
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:01,166
going to need to find
food supplies somewhere.

106
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,791
I know, let's look
here in the forest,

107
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,875
before we go up
to the Arctic Ridge.

108
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,208
[CHEVAL]
Good thinking.

109
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,250
[LILIA] Okay, when the sun
is directly overhead,

110
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,875
we'll all meet back here.

111
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,750
Try to gather as
much as you can.

112
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,291
Also, it's really easy to
get lost in these woods,

113
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,375
so be sure not to stray too far.

114
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,625
[OTHERS]
Got it!

115
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,708
You think that's enough?

116
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,125
[LILIA]
Oh! I might be able to use these

117

[MILLE]
Incredible!

00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,541

trees are full of fruit, too!

120

[HYORO] But I-I can't--
I can't carry any more.

00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,583
Wow!

There are all kinds of fruits
I've never even seen before!

124
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,541
It's just like I thought it
would be outside the village!

[stomach grumbles]

00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,333
Oh, man, wonder if
any of these trees

127
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,458
have donuts growing on 'em.

Wha--?!

00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,875
A donut tree! Donuts!

Hey, wait!

[CHEVAL] What's taking
Lute and Navirou so long?

We just started our journey.

How can he already be lost?

Oh, for goodness sake,

00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,083
this always happens when
those two go off together.

136
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:11,000
Well then, maybe we
shouldn't go any farther

137
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,916
and just rest here tonight?

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,625
No, I think I'm gonna go
look around a little more.

Yeah, me, too.

[HYORO]
Wait for me! I'm coming, too!

144
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,250
These aren't donuts.
They're just plain old fruit.

What a world. Where, oh,
where are Navirou's donuts?

Come on, let's go back.

Uh. Wait, so which
way did we come from?

150
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,291
Stand back. This calls for
Navirou's navigation skills.

151
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,541
This way!

152
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,958
Which means... we go this way.

153
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,625
Hey, wait, Lute, why
are you going that way?

154
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,458
Because your sense of direction
is always totally wrong.

155
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,166
It's more reliable to go
the exact opposite way.

156
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,791
What?!

157
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:10,416
You mean you don't trust

The rock started rolling!

[LUTE] That's not a rock,
it's a Konchu!

That was all your

Hey, was not!

Navirou didn't put that
Konchu there, so--! So cold!

Huh? Hey, so where are we?

Don't tell me we ran all the
way to the Arctic Ridge.

And what was that?

Oh, it's probably just
some thunder.

But never mind that, let's
head back to the others. Uh?

Oh, no, not another Konchu!

This is bad.

What should we do now, Cheval?

you drink your Hot Drink?

Wait, Lute, you'd better not.

Hey, don't stop short like that!

She's hurt pretty bad and
her body feels awfully cold.

She needs help.

Well, that should take care of
the first aid for her injury.

And don't forget the Hot Drink.

for an emergency
just like this one.

Wow, it's gotten
really dark already.

Yeah.

Do you think that
they're all right?

I don't know,

but I hope that Navirou
remembered to eat.

330
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,083
Well, I can tell you
that's one thing

331
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,375
we never need to worry about.

They'll be fine.
It's Lute after all.

Before too long,
he'll come, want food,

[LILIA chuckles]

337
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,458
You're probably right.

338
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:49,333
Navirou really doesn't wanna
become an appetizer for a Khezu!

Not good. We need to

It looks like nobody's home.

Ah, now that's... toasty.

Finally, we can get some rest.

Thinkin' about the others?

They must be so worried
about us right now.

358
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,916
I mean, we went through

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,333

Where are we?

You just won't learn, will you?

365
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,000
If you sit up too quickly
with an injury like that,

366
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,291
it's gonna hurt.

367
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,708
I know that.

368
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,291
What's this?

369
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,916
[LUTE]
A hot springs inn.

You guys brought me
all the way here?

00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,958
Yep! All thanks to
Navirou's navigation.

372
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,708
And we did it while running
away from that Khezu.

373
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:45,333
With you there, on my back.

374
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,916
[gasps]

00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,166
I can't tell you how
grateful I am for that.

00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,916
Good. That's great!

377
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,541
Because I was worried you'd say,

00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,958
"It's not like I asked
anybody to save me."

You know, like you did earlier.

Oh, right, my name's Lute.

Name's Navirou!

Lute and Navirou.

384
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,375
I'm Avinia.

00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,208
Avinia, huh?

386
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:17,333
[HYORO] I hope those
guys are doing okay.

387
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,166

Oh, yummy! Looks so tasty!

390
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,375
[LUTE] So, Avinia,
you said it was the Khezu

391
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,458
who did that to
your leg earlier?

392
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,791
[AVINIA]
That's right.

393
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,791
I came to the Arctic
Ridge with Frostfang

394
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,708
trying to find someone.

395
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:42,291
But then, along the way, we
were attacked by that Khezu.

396
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,625
Frostfang protected me.

397
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:48,041
And Frostfang is that Barioth
we met back in the cave, right?

398
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,166
[AVINIA]
Yes.

399
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,916
My beloved Frostfang
is the only family

400
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,333
that I have in this world.

401
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,041
Family.

402
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,416
[AVINIA]
Frostfang and I...

403
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,541
...understand each other
like no one else can.

404
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,375
And we respect each other
more than anyone else.

405
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,708
If you really are that
attuned to each other,

406
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:11,875
then you must know when
Frosty is hungry, for example.

407
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,125
Did you say, "Frosty"?

408
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,875
That's right. Yeah, Frosty.

409
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:15,708
Well, yeah.

410
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,041

411
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,833
Aw, that sounds really nice.

412
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,416
Frosty sure is one lucky
monster, you know.

413
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,083
Navirou wishes
more than anything

414
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,666
that he could have such a
powerful Kinship with somebody.

415
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,416
Someone who'd feed him donuts
whenever he got hungry.

416
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,541
Right? Eh, Lute?

417
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,250
Uh, hey there, Lute?
Are you listening?

Huh?

If you're a Rider,

why did you-why did you leave

Uh-huh. That's right.

Well, I... I had no choice.
