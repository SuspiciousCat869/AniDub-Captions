Oh, Itsy-Bits.

32

A true man of science

that which occurs before him,

that must automatically make
him the world's best Rider!

00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,500
[ANVIS]
Excellent work, Mad.

321
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,666
[MAD]
My lord.

322
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,708
[SHADOW] It's your
lucky day, little miss.

323
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:16,708
Not everyone is fortunate enough
to live with Lady Shadow.

324
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,708
Now don't go runnin'
off on your own,

325
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,708
leavin' your precious
Monstie behind, or else.

326
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,625
[WRATH laughs]

327
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,750
Not Frostfang! Please don't!

328
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:31,125
Promise me you won't do
anything to my Monstie!

329
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:32,750
Promise me!

330
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,875
Well, that's entirely up to you.

331
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,833
Yeah, we ain't interested
in that Monstie, anyway.

332
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:40,875
All we care about's that super
strong Kinship Stone of yours.

333
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:41,833
[ANVIS]
Wrath.

334
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,291
Oh. Whoops. Sorry.

335
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:47,083
Master Anvis, what shall we
do with the girl for now?

336
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,083
[ANVIS]
Keep her locked up.

337
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:52,083
We'll have to force
her to work for us,

338
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:55,375
and towards our ultimate goal.

339
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:58,041
Rejoice, my minions,
for at long last,

340
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,458
our time has come.

341
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:00,791
[ALL]
Sir!

342
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:08,541
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What are
we supposed to do now, Lute?

343
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,583
We rescue Avinia!

344
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,416
[LUTE]
Hey, Lute here!

345
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Just when we thought things
had finally calmed down,

346
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,291
Avinia's been kidnapped!

347
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,625
And a new kind of Rathalos
is about to show up

348
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,541
with a mysterious Rider!

349
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:25,458
Next time: "Attack
of the Ebon Riders!"

350
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:26,958
Ride On!
