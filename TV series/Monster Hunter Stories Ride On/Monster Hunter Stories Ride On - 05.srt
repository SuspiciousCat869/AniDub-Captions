482
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,583
Genie!

483
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:29,083
You should be ashamed running
away from Lute and Cheval.

484
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,750
Riders treasure all
forms of Kinship.

485
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,625
That goes for both Monsties
as well their friends.

486
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,958
Think about what you've done.

487
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:40,250
Genie. I thought you wanted...

488
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:45,208
You were just trying to win
the race for your brother.

489
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:48,791
It's all right. You didn't do
anything wrong, Hyoro.

490
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,500
[CHIEF OMNA]
Congratulations, Lute!

491
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:56,666
You're the winner of the Race!

492
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,416
All right! So what do I get?

493
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,583
Ahem! Gamigami.
Bring forth the prize!

494
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,041
I'd love to,

495
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,666
but you were in charge of
preparing the award, Chief.

496
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,250
Well, you were the one that
kept asking for something to do.

497
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,208
Don't tell me...
There's no prize?

498
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,708
You get the honor
of being chief for a day!

499
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,416
I don't wanna!

500
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,416
Chief for a day?
You've gotta be kidding me!

501
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,291
You saw a Congalala?
On Mt. Dacapo?

502
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:26,625
That's right.

503
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,500
[DAN]
But why?

[NAVIROU]
<i>Monstie Manual</i> .

505
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,541
Here comes the part
where Navirou

506
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,000
teaches you about Monsties.

507
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,000
Now then, Navirou hopes you have

508
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,291
your Media Trigger Smart
Phone app open for this.

509
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,666
And get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

510
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:51,583
Now it's time to form a
Kinship with our Monsties!

511
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:53,666
The moment of new life.

512
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,041
Awaken!

513
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:01,125
[NAVIROU] Our Monstie
this time is: Congalala!

514
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:03,875
This monster's got a
bottomless pit for a stomach!

515
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:05,916
Mushrooms happen to
be its favorite food

516
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,083
and its Breath Attack changes
depending on the type it eats.

517
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:12,333
Navirou doesn't stand a chance
against its powerful farts!

518
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:13,875
Keep your distance!

519
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:18,041
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!

520

[LUTE]
Hey, Lute here!

521
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:22,250
Cheval's itching to get his
hands on a rare you know what!

522
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:23,666
You guessed it!

523
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,666
A great glorious glittering
golden egg, obviously!

524
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,916
Next time:
"Quest for the Golden Egg."

525
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,291
Ride On!
