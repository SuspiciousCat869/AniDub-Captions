Everything's just as
Chief Omna suspected,

00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:42,625

It's good to see you again, Dan,

but why'd you'd come
all the way out here?

as soon as possible.

Gamigami only came
'cause he thinks

Tropical Berries
grow around here.

Um, well yes, but no.

some Tropical Berries.

you've mentioned

bury our whole camp site.

controlling the Monsters

93

and making them
fight each other. Well then.

94
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,625
I'd say it's almost
as impressive as

95
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:10,541
what those young Riders
are capable of.

96
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:14,250
Taking down a Blighted
Cephadrome is no easy task.

And we couldn't do
a thing to help.

taken it down ourselves,

without incident.
We just gave them

this little victory
to be friendly.

What really matters is that
the quicksand has stopped,

off our "to-do" list!

Hmm, I don't understand.

Why is the quicksand
still out there?

110
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,625
It just means that there
must be another cause for it.

00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,916
Yes true, but what
could that cause be?

but we have an idea.

your question surprises me,

but yes, we do
have a sacred stone

Chief Nolma!

00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,833
We're in a crisis!

122
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,333
And without help from other
villagers, even Riders,

123
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,750
we will be overcome
by this menace!

124
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,583
Yes, Chief.

125
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,875
[NOLMA] Surely, it is
this spirit of cooperation

126
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,916
against a common threat
that has brought you

127
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,708
all here from
your own distant land.

128
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,166
That's right, Chief,

129
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,833
and that glowing
stone your village

130
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,583
has is what Riders
call "Kinship Ore."

131
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,166
If you'll allow us,
we need to see

132
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,541
if the Black Blight has infected
yours, before it's too late.

133
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,041
Ya see, back in our village,

134
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,000
we found out the only way
to stop the advance

135
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,750
of the Black Blight was to
purify our own Kinship Ore.

136
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,791
Purify it?

137
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:01,416
And I assume this ritual
requires a Rider's powers?

138
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,916
You are correct, Chief Nolma.

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,250
[sighs]
I understand.

140
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,291
If that is what must be done,
you have my permission.

141
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,083
Thank you, Chief Nolma.

Well, glad we figured that out.

I will find them!

No matter what it takes,
those berries will be mine.

Is this that berry thing again?

Oh, yeah.

All right, listen up.

If you find even a single berry,

[LUTE, NAVIROU]
What you hear?

155
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,666
Have you ever actually
eaten these berries before?

156
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,041
Not yet, I saw some once
though, when I was a kid.

you know they taste good?

Yes, sir.

the fact that

Before we get on

it's best to do
something as a group--
