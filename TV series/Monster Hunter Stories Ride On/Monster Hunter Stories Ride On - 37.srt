[NARRATOR]
These youngsters are Riders,

2
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:12,125
on a quest to track down
blackened Kinship Ore

3
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:17,041
and stop the Black Blight that's
been spreading across the world.

4
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:18,916
Lute found a white dragon's egg,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,333
said to be that of the
legendary Rider Redan's Monstie.

6
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,125
But before he could
hatch the egg,

7
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,416
Dr. Manelger
managed to steal it!

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,833
Now Lute's in a desperate
race to retrieve the egg.

9
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:33,583
Meanwhile, Dr. Manelger used
Cheval to try to hatch the egg,

10
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,750
but found it's not as
easy he had hoped.

11
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,833
Now, the moment of new life.

12
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:39,916
Awaken!

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,750
O dragon white,
please be my Monstie!

14
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:48,583
[DR. MANELGER]
As I suspected.

15
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:51,666
This Kinship Stone
lacks sufficient power.

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,875
The power necessary to
awaken the white dragon.

17
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:56,250
Don't touch it!

18
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:59,125
You expect me to believe
that it's not strong enough?

19
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,000
[NARRATOR] But luckily
for Lute and Navirou,

20
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,750
Lilia had found evidence
of a new Kinship Ore

21
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:07,416
that could lead them all right
to the mad doctor and the egg.

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,458
We know where Manelger is!
For real this time!

And so, after a long time away,

25
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,458
our heroes are finally
returning home!

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,958
Almost there. Home at last.

27
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:28,416
Yeah.

28
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,625
Gotta give the people
what they need.

serious Navirou withdrawal

[ITSY-BITS]
Huh?

You really think there's
a Kinship Ore in here?

40
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,000
Of course I do!

My hunches haven't
steered me wrong, so far!

I can feel it's energy.
Feel it, I say!

I don't feel anything.

This world's home
to 50,000 scientists.

Only a handful can hope to
achieve everlasting glory!

46
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:32,000
To achieve such greatness
requires canny intuition,

47
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:35,666
and the commitment to believe
in it, and to act upon it!

So, whaddaya think, Lute?

We've almost rebuilt
the whole village.

Wow! Lala's house looks great!

And the stables, too!

It could pose a real danger
to your flowerbed.

And so it goes.

If that happens, I'll
just plant more seeds.

to the Scriveners, Lilia.

Simone told me all about
how hard you're working.

77
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:32,416
Yes. But, Chief, what
about Dr. Manelger?

78
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,583
For the moment, I think
we're all right.

79
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:38,083
And if he does show up, I'll
knock his block off, myself.

Okay.

81
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,958
Your letter also said
something was happening

82
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,500
with the Kinship Ore?

83
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,916
Yes.

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,083
Of course, you're asking
about the second Kinship Ore

85
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,541
in Hakum Village, right?

Hold on.

88

There's an entirely
different ore

89

from the one Lute and
the Riders purified?

in the ruins of Redan's Village,

References to a
second Kinship Ore.

Yes.

We know that Dr. Manelger stole

95
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,375
the white dragon's egg
so he'd have the Monstie

under his control.

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,250
But to hatch it, he needs
the power of a Kinship Ore.

00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,666
And he's already gone
to Cheval for help.

All we do know is that he's had
contact with Dr. Manelger.

103
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:28,791
I see. I was concerned,
but I didn't expect this.

104
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:32,041
But would Cheval really
team up with a guy like that?

105

Navirou wouldn't do it
for a billion donuts.

For a great while, I've had a
feeling this day would come.

Ever since Lute first
discovered Ratha's egg

in the Forbidden Woods,

help of a Kinship Stone.

Right. The Waterfall of Trials.

That's the name by which
it is commonly called,

129
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,000
but it also goes by one with
a more profound meaning.

130
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:44,250
The water coursing over those
falls is no ordinary water,

131
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,208
it comes from a pure,
unsullied source.

And since ancient times,

near the Purespring.

When there's strange writing,

there's definitely something
hiding on the other side!

That's it! The Kinship Ore
is beyond the Purespring!

Well done, Lute. That's correct.

149
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,500
But there is one more thing
you must know about this Ore.

[DR. MANELGER] I can feel
its energy! Feel it, I say!

Only feeling I have
is a bad one.

152
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,708
[CHIEF OMNA] In any age, if the
ore is touched by someone pure,

153
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:52,458
the energy and light it emanates
will become even purer still.

154
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,041
But if the person
touching it is evil

155
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,875
in an instant, the Ore will
become corrupted with darkness.

156
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,791
Hm? What's that?

I think we found the jack pot!

00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,708
In a way, it's as powerful as
the promise of the morning sun,

320
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,250
telling us that no matter
how bad things may seem,

321
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,166
tomorrow will bring
a new beginning.

322
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,916
And that's the reason why the
Purification Rite is held there.

323
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,958
I get it.

324
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,333
Oh, Cheval.

325
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,583
Lute was able to stop
the Blight, this time.

326
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:27,083
It looks like the Blight has
completely vanished, sir.

327
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,833
I assume Lute has
purified the Ore,

328
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:33,291
and what a powerful
Kinship Ore it is, Itsy-Bits!

329
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:36,166
We're not leaving with
it, like I hoped to,

330
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,708
but I've still
gained an awful lot!

331
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,500
[laughs]

332
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:46,583
Well, um, actually,
we did... get this.

333
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:47,750
[DR. MANELGER gasps]

334
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:48,958
[DR. MANELGER]
Is that--?

335
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,250
[ITSY-BITS] It's a shard
of that Kinship Ore.

336
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,291
[DR. MANELGER]
Slap!

337
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,708
Hey! What'd you hit me for?

338
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:03,250
Well done, Itsy!

339
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,583
[LUTE] The last time we
were here was with Cheval.

340
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:11,916
[NAVIROU]
Yeah.

341
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,958
[LUTE] We did the
Purification Rite together.

342
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:18,208
We left the village together.

343
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,291
[CHIEF OMNA]
Cheval, since you were a boy,

344
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,666
you have shown great kindness.

345
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,833
You can easily sense
the pain in others.

346
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:29,916
Of your many strengths,
this empathy impresses me most.

347
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,916
You must always keep
it in your heart.

348
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,208
Yes.

349
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,750
Heavy, aren't they?

350
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,083
Know these swords are yours,

351
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,125
however, only draw them
to defend yourself,

352
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,041
a friend, or your Kinship.

353
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,041
The sword's weight represents
the weight of the Kinship

354
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,166
that binds you together.

355
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,291
When we left Hakum Village,

356
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,291
we were even closer
than brothers.

357
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,291
But now we're walking
two separate paths.

358
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,666
Can it go back to how it was?

359
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,500
[gasps]

360
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,375
[CHEVAL]
Hmph.

361
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:19,625
I came back when
I heard there were

362
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,541
some Blighted
monsters in the area.

363
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:23,541
I guess I missed 'em.

364
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,250
[LUTE]
Cheval.

365
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,583
[NAVIROU]
<i>Monstie Manual</i> !

366
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,541
Here comes the part
where Navirou

367
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,083
tells you about Monsties.

368
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,083
All right, Navirou
hopes you have

369
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,291
your Media Trigger
Smart Phone app open.

370
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,708
Better get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

371
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:51,875
And now, it's time to form
a Kinship with our Monsties!

372
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:54,000
The moment of new life!

373
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:56,291
Awaken!

374
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,000
[NAVIROU] Our Monstie
this time is: Monoblos!

375
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,583
Genie rides this Flying Wyvern,

376
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:07,416
which boasts big-time strength
to go with its big horn!

377
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,291
And believe Navirou, there's
nothing Monoblos loves more

378
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:11,625
than a one-on-one fight.

379
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,916
This is one macho monster!

380
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,791
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!

381
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:20,375
[LUTE] Now Cheval's back
in Hakum Village, too?

382
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:23,208
Aw, man! There's so much
I need to tell him!

383
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:25,500
Next time: "The Little Bouquet."

384
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:26,958
Ride On!
