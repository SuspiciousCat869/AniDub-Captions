[LUTE yells]

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,375
C'mon, Lute, run faster!

4
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:15,166
I would if I didn't
have to carry you!

5
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:20,916
Don't worry, pal!

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,750
Navirou will take good
care of your egg!

7
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,875
It doesn't sound
like he's buying it!

8
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:29,583
Plan B! Navirou will
distract it with items!

9
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,250
[screams]

10
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,958
[NAVIROU]
Navirou threw his donuts, too!

11
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:46,875
[BOTH gasp]

12
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,708
[NARRATOR]
This young boy's name is Lute,

13
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:50,625
a rash but enthusiastic fellow,

14
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:54,416
who dreams of becoming the
world's top Monster Rider.

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Lute and his friends have
finally arrived in Gildegaran,

16
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,000
home to the Hunter's Guild.

17
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,916
Small town boy in the city!

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,291
[NARRATOR]
The kids have mostly managed

19
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,291
to keep thier Rider
status a secret,

20
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,708
as they gather information
on the Kinship Ore

21
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:10,083
affected by the Black Blight.

22
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:15,041
Wow, y' know, you kinda
remind me of Ratha!

23
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:18,333
Oh, lucky day!

24
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:20,583
There's a Rider right
here in Gildegaran!

25
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:24,125
This is the chance we've
been waiting for, Doctor!

26
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,791
[chuckles]

27
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,166
[LUTE]
I'm beat.

28
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,916
Good night, Navirou.

29
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:37,833
When you can sleep, sleep.
That's a Navi-rule.

30
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,875
[knocking]

31
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,166
He's still sleeping?

32
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,791
What?! We have a Quest!
Jerk! I'm waking him up!

33
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,375
Don't bother.

34
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,916
When he's like this,

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,958
not even a Field Horn blast
right in the ear will wake him.

36
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,791
[MILLE] Well, good for Lute,
but we can't wait all day.

37
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,208
[CHEVAL]
We'll go without him.

38
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:03,208
[HYORO] That'll work.
After all, we still have Rathi.

39
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,750
[MILLE]
That's true.

40
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,541
[LUTE screams]

41
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,791
You were supposed to wake
me up for the Quest!

42
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,583
Navirou forgot. Sorry.

43
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,541
You can't just
shrug this one off!

44
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,000
Now they're on a Quest and
we've got nothing to do!

45
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,541
[INNKEEPER]
Excuse me, sirs.

46
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,125
If you'll be staying
one more night,

47
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,208
would you please settle
your bill in advance?

48
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,875
Oh. Sure.

49
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,000
Go ahead, pay him, Navirou.

50
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,416
[LUTE]
Huh?

51
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,666
[INNKEEPER]
Oh?

52
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,375
[NAVIROU]
Can't.

53
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,875
[LUTE]
Owie.

54
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,125
Ah, we'll be fine, Lute!

55
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,250
What did you do with it?

56
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,875
I know that Chief
Omna give us enough

57
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,916
to afford a month's
worth of lodging!

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,375
Yes, that is correct.

59
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,750
And it's gone?

60
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,375
Navirou will explain.

61
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,458
He was in charge of the funds.

62
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,625
And yes, he took the
responsibility seriously.

63
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,458
So seriously that he spent it
on something of great value.

64
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,750
Something more important
than a mere bed to sleep in.

65
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,250
Something essential to
our very well-being!

66
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,291
Navirou couldn't resist this
town's variety of donuts.

67
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:20,125
How could you spend
everything we had on donuts?

68
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,208
'Cause that's a Navi---

69
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,333
So where are we supposed
to stay tonight?

70
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,791
We cant even afford
to buy real food!

71
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,416
[NAVIROU] Fear not!
Navirou has connections.

72
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,458
What are you talking about?

73
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,833
You'll see.

74
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:43,041
You try to sit down
and have a nice meal.

75
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,125
What're they doing here?

76
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,166
Mew met in Hakum
Village, remember?

77
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,791
Yeah, I know. So what?

78
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:54,083
So they'll be staying
with us for a while.

79
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,541
And this place is
nice and cheap, too!

80
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,458
We have a spare room, Reverto.

81
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,666
This will let us take in
a little extra income.

82
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,166
It's purr-fect.

83
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,583
I gotta say,

84
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,583
I'm kinda impressed you
really did have a connection.

85
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,791
All part of Navirou's
Felyne Network.

86
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,708
Other than me, I didn't
think you had friends.

87
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,875
Hey! Don't say such
depressing things, Lute!

88
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,291
Navirou may have
spent our Zenny,

89
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,791
but he still got us
a place to live!

90
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,833
[REVERTO] I never said
you could live here!

91
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,416
Aw, man.

92
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,208
Mew have no choice
but to let them stay.

93
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,916
With the way mew laze around,
the bills are piling up!

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,583
We can't even afford to
buy a loaf of bread!

95
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:30,916
If mew wanna earn even more,

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,458
mew could go down
to the jungle river

97
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,833
and hunt the swarms of Altaroth.

98
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,375
[REVERTO]
Altaroth, huh?

99
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:39,750
Nope.

100
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,583
And this is why we're
renting out the spare room.

101
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,583
Fine, they can stay.

102
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:45,916
Listen, son!

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,083
I'm no babysitter, so you
take care of yourself.

104
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:51,708
Your business is your business,
not mine! Got that?

105
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,875
You listen!

106
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,416
I'm no baby. I can handle my own
business just fine, all right?

107
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,458
Good, then we're both
on the same page.

108
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,500
Clean the spare room
and it's all yours.

109
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,750
However! My room's off-limits
to everyone but me!

110
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,958
If I find out you or your
little friend went in there,

111
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,708
there's gonna be trouble.

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,833
[POPOLA]
Here's mewr room.

113
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,875
[groans]

114
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,041
[POPOLA]
If mew wanna stay in it,

115
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,625
all mew gotta do is clean it.

116
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:21,875
And if mew don't like it,

117
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,583
mew're more than welcome
to sleep on the street.

118
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,625
So now we're chore boys?
How convenient for them.

119
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,500
[NAVIROU]
Well, go get 'em, big guy!

120
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,000
[LUTE]
Oh, no!

121
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:40,458
It worked!

122
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,875
All right! Quest complete!

123
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,541
[BOTH sigh]

124
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,583
[REVERTO]
Oh!

125
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,833
This place actually
looks livable!

126
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,375
Hey, good news.

127
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,875
I talked to the Guild and
they said come on over.

128
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,375
Wait, for what?

129
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,666
Because If mew don't get to
work, mew don't get to eat.

130
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,916
[BOTH]
Hm?

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,833
[ELDEST DAUGHER]
Reverto gave us some details.

132
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,083
But we're still thinking of
the right Quest for you.

133
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:14,250
What? I didn't know I was
allowed to do a Quest alone.

134
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,875
You are. Although, it
depends upon the Quest.

135
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,250
Excuse me!

136
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,750
Is it true that
you're staying at

137
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,166
the diabolical, lone-wolf,
expert-Hunter Reverto's place

138
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,875
What? How did you know that?

139
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,625
Our Felyne friend
Popola said so.

140
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,375
For a loner like Reverto
to let you stay there,

141
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:33,666
that must mean you two are
pretty special in your right.

142
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,000
[LUTE, NAVIROU]
Hm?

143
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,291
Oh! Here's a good one for you!

144
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,041
A Mushroom-gathering Quest!

145
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:42,291
All you have to do is go out and
find us ten Primo Mushrooms.

146
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,500
Wait, hold on.
Mushroom-gathering?

147
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,458
You underestimate us.

148
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,125
[chuckles]

149
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:51,416
Mushroom-gathering is an
honorable and worthy Quest.

150
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,166
Everything has a deeper
meaning, you know.

151
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:54,875
What?

152
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,041
Whether big or small,

153
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,250
every Quest has
something to offer.

154
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,625
[GUILD MASTER] Young man,
it is only by gaining experience

155
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,916
that you're able
to gain knowledge.

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,375
Likewise, the more
experience you gain,

157
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,083
you will find it
progressively easier

158
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,125
to win the trust of others.

159
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,000

00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,333
Like how and when the
monsters are moving.

317
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,666
[NAVIROU] Sure, that's great!
Now cut us down!

318
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,833
Yeah, I guess I should, huh?

319
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,666
[NAVIROU]
What about Navirou?

320
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:21,250
Mr. Reverto, you forgot about
Navirou! Hey! Save Navirou!

321
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,791
Okay, Lute. I think you
can handle it from here.

322
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,208
All right, pal, let's
show 'em what we can do!

323
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,083
What?

324
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,666
What, is this snack time?

325
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,416
It ate Konchu and burped
them out as fireballs!

326
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,333
We'll give that move
the tasteful name:

00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,666
"Fireball Expulsion!"

328
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,208
Hey, that's awesome!

329
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,833
So that's the Rider's
Kinship Attack, huh?

330
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,875
Wow, that's cool.

331
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,791
Well, technically,
it's hot, but who cares?

332
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,000
[REVERTO] Well, after a hard day
of avoiding a Nerscylla's mouth,

333
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,041

ones doing the eating.

anything to earn it.

Thanks, Brother Reverto!
You're the coolest!

Don't call me that.

Navirou's full!

Well, bully for you.
I didn't get a single piece.

344

Hey, uh, Brother Reverto, sir?

345

[REVERTO]
Hm?

346
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,291
Um. It would be an honor
to get your autograph.

347
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,166
What? Autograph?

348
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,583
I mean, I guess I could.

349
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,250
Okay, your name?

00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,791
Yeah, well, uh, there's no
need to trouble with that.

351
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,041
Come on, Debli, be honest.

352
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,041
You're selling it.

Uh.

Well, you sure know how
to ruin a guy's night.

00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,291
But the part about you being
the coolest was totally true!

Wow, who knew that

[REVERTO]
Oh, no! It's on me!

00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:26,791
I'm itching everywhere! No! No!

367
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,291
I wonder if he realizes
that waving a torch around

368
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,125
is only gonna attract
more of them.

369

Brother Reverto isn't
the man I thought he was.

So are you all
checked out of the inn?

Yeah, about that--

374
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,875
It's more accurate to say
that we got chucked out.

375
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,708
Which was all your fault!

things go on today's Quest?

I'm proud to say we just
defeated a Gypceros.

Wait, that's all?

We did happen to defeat
a Nerscylla as well.

Yeah, I mean it wasn't all me.
Reverto helped a lot.

387
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,375
I can't believe you
defeated a Nerscylla.

388
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,541
Well, sounds like it's easier

389
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,708
when a pro-Hunter's there
to do the dirty work.

You slayed a Nerscylla
on a Mushroom Quest.

I had a feeling you were
a skilled young man,

fortune, and glory,

00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,500
the lure of the outside world
has long beckoned Riders

412
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,333
right into this very
city of Gildegaran.

413

stood in that spot.

[GUILD MASTER]
It's no great secret.

420
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,875
Riders just couldn't
get used to this place.

421
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,583
People who hunt monsters
and people who ride them

422
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,458
are cut from different cloth.

423
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:51,875
That sounds so familiar.
Like something Chief Omna said.

424
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,708
And that is why, many years ago,

425
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,333
Riders and Hunters decided
it would be best

426
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:01,583
to go their separate
paths in this world.

427
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,125
That way, both could
fulfill their callings,

428
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:08,125
without ever being in
conflict with the other.

429
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:11,333
Riders preferred seclusion and
settled in distant villages

430
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,583
that put them close to nature.

431
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,541
Meanwhile, the Hunters
constructed great cities,

432
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,458
within which their
Guilds were born.

433
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,416
Separate they have remained,

434
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,958
and continue to do
so to this day.

435
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,500
That means we have
a real opportunity.

436
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:29,958
You know what I mean?

437
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,250

from each other.

Yes, you've got it!

That's exactly right, my boy.

440
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:40,000
But I warn you. This task
will not be an easy one.

441
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:43,791
You Riders commune with monsters
and form Kinship with them.

442
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:47,166
This is an arrangement we
Hunters find hard to comprehend,

443
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,041
let alone support.

444
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:53,916
Your first step then, must be to
dispel their skepticism of you.

445

Right, I want people to
learn more about Riders,

and I wanna learn about Hunters!

When the Hunters of this guild

448
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,375
see how you can be
of help to our city,

449
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,833
surely their view
of you will change.

450
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,541
Make yourself known to Hunters,

451
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:12,500
and Riders will become
known in return.

Thank you, sir. I will.

But beyond that advice,
I've no more.

Whether you can make an
honest go of it in this city

then attacks with

00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:18,000
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!

474
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,250
[LUTE]
Hey! Lute here!

475
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,458
While exploring the forest,

476
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,791
we discovered a whole
village of Felynes!

477
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,208
Huh? Some of these
Felynes are weird.

478
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:26,958
Almost as weird as Navirou.

479
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:29,750
Next time: "The Legend
of Pawpad Place"!

480
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,291
Ride On!
