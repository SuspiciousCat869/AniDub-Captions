She is not Navirou's

stopped sailing to the island,

The "Bandit Captain," Silva!

sail for Naubaka Island

I spent many-a-sleepless night
worrying where you two might be.

We searched everywhere we
could possibly think of!

I saw a good omen.

upright in my tea,

And even after Navirou vanished
without saying a word.

321
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,750
Got it!

322
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:48,000
Attack it the next time
it uses its breath!

323
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,541
Rock Smash attack!

324
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,333
Pansy!

325
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,375
Navirou.

326
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:26,500
You're safe, Pansy.
Navirou's here.

327
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,583
Hm?

328
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,708
[NAVIROU]
Hey! You leave her alone!

329
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,416
[NAVIROU screams]

330
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,708
Mew did it! Mew're my hero.

331
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:58,166
Thank mew. That's twice
mew've saved my life.

332
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,458
How'll I ever repay mew?

333
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,666
No, Pansy, Navirou
should be thanking you.

334
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,708
He'll always owe you for
finding him on that beach.

335
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,458
Navirou.

336
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,875
Are you guys okay?

337
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,166
Yeah.

338
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,541
Hey, why're you
riding Great Poogie?

339
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,291
Oh, right, about that.

340
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,250
Ride On!

341
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,833
Barioth!

342
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,875
I think your Monstie is sick.

343
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,750
It must be this weather.

344
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,458
Frost Fang is used to
a much colder climate.

345
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,208
Just leave this to me!

346
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,916
Ride On!

347
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,666
Great Poogie!

[POOGIE]
Poogie, poogie, poogie...

349
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,125
Hey! Come back!

350
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,458
So much for leaving this to him.

351
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:48,958
[laughs]

352
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,000
And that's why it's important
we Riders stick together!

353
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,208
Right?

354
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,583
Hey, c'mon, you guys.
Back me up here.

355
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,916
[AVINIA]
It's infected with the Blight.

356
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,666
[LUTE]
It's not just this monster.

357
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,458
Pansy and I found
the Blight inland

358
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,666
and Navirou saw it at the shore.

359
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,500
What now?

360
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,833
The ore.

361
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,916
There must be Kinship Ore
somewhere around here.

362
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,916
And if the Black Blight's
already taken it over,

363
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,166
like I think it has, we're
gonna have to purify it!

364
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,166
Tiger.

365
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,166
[NAVIROU]
Uh?

366
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,708
It looks like we
had mew all wrong.

367
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,208
Sorry 'bout that.

368
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,250
And I'm sorry I stole
your precious donut.

369
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,666
Okay, thanks?

370
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,208
Misunderstanding or not,
I acted like a jerk,

371
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,958
and that was wrong.

372
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,333
Go on, hit me.

373
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,875
Um, I don't really
feel like being hit.

374
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:56,541
But you can call me any names
you want and I'll take it.

375
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,750
Please accept these
tokens of friendship.

376
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,333
[TIGER, SCREWTAIL gasp]

377
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,666
After all, you fellas were only
looking out for Pansy, right?

378
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,750
Well, obviously, Navirou
cares about her, too!

379
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:16,208
That means we're all
on the same side!

380
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:20,041
Navirou. You're
such a good guy.

381
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,333
And after all the cruddy
things we said and did.

382
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,916
You're not good, you're great!

383
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,833
Okay, bring it in!

384
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,750
[TIGER, SCREWTAIL]
Oh, Navirou!

385
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,125
[TIGER, SCREWTAIL crying]

386
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,791
[TIGER]
We're so sorry.

387
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:42,208
[NAVIROU] Pansy, remember
the first time we came here?

388
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:45,291
The Anesfreesia were blooming
just like they are now.

389
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,541
Feels like only yesterday.

390
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:52,708
So, um, there's something
I've wanted to ask mew.

391
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:59,541
Navirou, can you
think about maybe...

392
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,208
....staying this time?

393
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,041
Uh?

394
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,583
Mew don't want to?

395
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,166
No, It's not like that at all.

396
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,416
It's just complicated.

397
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,625
But everyone in the
village would be so happy

398
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,125
if mew stayed with us.

399
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:16,000
We could live here
together, Navirou.

400
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,416
[NAVIROU]
Pansy.

401
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,458
Here's the thing.

402
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,500
[CHIEF MALLERIE]
Bad news, everyone!

403
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,791
It's an emergency!

404
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,166
Granny, what's wrong?

405
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,541
Someone has stolen Granny's
precious pickle weight!

[NAVIROU]
<i>Monstie Manual</i> !

408
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,375
Here comes the part
where Navirou

409
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,916
tells you about Monsties.

410
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,916
All right, Navirou
hopes you have

411
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,125
your Media Trigger
Smart Phone app open.

412
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,541
Better get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

413
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:51,708
And now, it's time to form
a Kinship with our Monsties!

[NAVIROU] Our Monstie
this time is: Yian Garuga!

417
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,833
You can't miss this bird wyvern

418
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,666
thanks to its black shell,
poisonous tail, and long mane.

419
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,833
It's so hot tempered, it'll keep
attacking even when hurt!

00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:13,791
This is one Monstie
you can count on!

monster hatches next time!
