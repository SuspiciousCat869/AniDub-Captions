[NARRATOR]
This young boy's name is Lute,

2
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:13,583
a rash, but enthusiastic fellow
who dreams of becoming

3
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:17,416
the world's top Monster Rider.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,416
With his Monstie
Ratha by his side,

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,750
Lute and his friends
Cheval, Mille, and Hyoro

6
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:24,666
have made it through
one trial after another.

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,083
But now, the woods
surrounding their quiet home

8
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,250
of Hakum Village
are turning black,

9
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,833
thanks to a mysterious blight

10
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:34,500
that is causing dangerous
changes to the monsters as well.

11
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:54,333
[roaring]

12
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:58,291
I wonder if that Nargacuga
is going to attack tonight.

13
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't know.

14
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:03,583
Nole's late coming
back in. I'm worried.

15
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,208
[NOLE screams]

16
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,041
[DAN]
Are you okay?

17
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:14,750
Nole!

18
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,291
It's coming!

19
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:19,250
The Nargacuga. It's coming!

20
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,000
[NOLE] Out of nowhere,
it shot spikes at us.

21
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,708
The Black Blight's
corrupted the Nargacuga.

22
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,291
We don't know what it'll do.

23
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,625
Hey, Dan.

24
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,416
If the Nargacuga isn't
acting rationally anymore,

25
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,208
why don't we set a trap for it?

26
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,250
That's a good point.

27
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,000
[LUTE]
Hey!

28
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,291
Oh, good! You're all back!

29
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,958
And Chief Omna's with you?

30
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,416
Tell me what happened, Dan.

31
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,791
I'm afraid that
the latest victim

32
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,500
of the Blight is a Nargacuga.

33
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,208
And now he's headed
right toward the village.

34
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,958
It attacked Nole while
he was out on patrol.

35
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,625
But he's okay, right?

36
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:01,458
The Nargacuga really does have
Hakum Village in its sights.

37
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,333
[GENIE] We'll be in charge of
defending all the approaches.

38
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,208
Apprentice Riders will help
the villagers take shelter.

39
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:10,416
Well, Chief. The village
is in your hands.

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,541
Uh, hi?

41
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,333
We've done this
kinda stuff before.

42
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,375
If the Nargacuga breaks
into the village,

43
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,958
I'll chase it right back out.

44
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,583
Yeah, that's right!

45
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:28,291
We may be old timers now, but
we were once Riders like you.

46
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,916
Gamigami, Lala, and Jiji
really wanna help us,

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,666
but I think... I'll pass.

48
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,958
Yeah, how does that
old saying go?

49
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:39,000
They're no spring... pigeons?

50
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,833
They're no spring chickens!

51
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,041
[ALL]
What'd you say?!

52
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,083
[chuckles nervously]

53
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,666
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,791
Thanks a lot, Navirou,
you got them mad at me, too!

55
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:53,500
[NAVIROU] Oh, no, they aren't
mad at Navirou. Just you.

56
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,625
[LILIA growls]

57
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,166
Mom. You're here!

58
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,333
Oh, thank goodness!

59
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,666
I was worried when
you didn't come back.

60
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,083
I heard things are getting
pretty bad out there.

61
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,083
It's my fault you
were worried, Mrs. Vlau.

62
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,125
I kind of dragged them
out there with me.

63
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,958
We're fine. Don't forget
that we're Riders.

64
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:11,791
So when an Arzuros attacks,
we all know what to do.

65
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,250
Arzuros attack?

66
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,125
Don't worry, Mrs. Vlau,
Ratha and I were there, too.

67
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,708
And now we'll drive
off that Nargacuga!

68
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:22,083
It's such a relief that you're
always there to help each other.

69
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,791
Lilia, you better go
check in with your family.

70
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,541
They're all hunkering down.

71
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,333
Right!

72
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,583
That's good.

73
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,791
Everyone's following our
time-honored procedures

74
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,458
for this situation.

75
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,625
You should go inside.

76
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,500
I will, but the Kometas
are out of town,

77
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,666
and I can't find
the twins anywhere.

78
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,833
We have to find those kids.

79
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,916
Oh, don't worry,
I'll help you with that.

Yeah, not one bit!

It's the Hakum Slash!

Protectors of Hakum Village!

How are things outside the town?

Dan and the guys
are standing guard.

89
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,250
There's a Nargacuga.
It's wandering around out there.

90
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,791
It could pose a real
danger to your flowerbed.

91
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,041
And so it goes.

92
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,916
If that happens,
I'll just plant more seeds.

The garden will bloom again.

Take good care of them,
and before you know it,

00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,916
they'll bloom.

[LUTE]
Mh-hm.

104
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,166
We're planting these
so we always remember

105

when you first came
to this village.

playing at the blacksmith's?

110
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,166
[DEN-DEN]
We weren't playing!

Okay, how 'bout this?

Now your job is to
guard the shrine.

Yeah!

where they'll be safe.

And you?

118

I'm cooking for the town,
so I have to stop at home

119
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,750
and get a few things
from the kitchen.

120

I'll come, too.

Bring as much food
as you can, Cheval.

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,666
I want everyone to eat well.

125

[CHEVAL]
Okay, hold on!

126
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,958
[VLAU] Am I right to think you
haven't told anyone yet?

127
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:11,791
Yeah, but Ratha and Rathian,
they'll make a great pair.

128
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,250
You mean just like
you and Lute do?

129
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,083

Well, we better hurry.

Took long enough!

132
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,916
There's still a ton left to do

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,125
and we could really use
an extra set of hands!

134
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,208
Navirou likes what
he sees so far.

Everything shipshape.

136

But it's time now for Navirou

to take his rightful
place as leader.

Don't worry, I'll take it

Hey, Lute!

144
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,375
I checked on my family
and they're fine.

145
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,666
A little mad I made
them worry, though.

146
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,208
Where's Cheval and his Mom?

147
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,083
Not back.

00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,625
[VLAU]
Lend a hand if you can, folks.

150
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,833
We're cooking for the
whole town tonight.

151
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:08,041
Mrs. Vlau! Would you please
cook a soufflé for Navirou?

152
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,208
Soufflés will have to wait

153
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,166
until this town gets
back to normal.

154
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,083
Right now, I'm cooking
a mushroom soup.

155
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,125
[NAVIROU] Ooh! Navirou
likes mushroom soup, too!

156
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,375
Oh! And while you do that,

157
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,416
I'll mix up some Energy
Drinks for everyone.

158
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,916
Help! Help! Help!
Somebody please help Lilia.

Then something must've
happened to the Riders!

323
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,208
There's no need to worry yet.

324
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,375
For now, focus on making
sure the little ones

325
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,666
don't leave the shrine.

326
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,041
We wanna fight!

327
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,541
We wanna fight!

328
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,750
Hey, we could fight it
from inside the shrine!

329
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,291
[TWINS]
Yeah!

330
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,375
Lala, it just crushed
your house!

331
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,875
Why did it have to be mine?

332
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,666
There's no rhyme or reason.

333
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,250
With the Black Blight
corrupting it,

334
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,041
the Nargacuga has
become nothing more

335
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,750
than an irrational destroyer!

336
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,375
[gasps]

337
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,375
Let's do what we can
to slow it down!

338
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,125
[MEN]
Yeah!

339
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,083
[LUTE]
Hey, get off!

340
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,708
[roars]

341
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,750
[roars]

342
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,875
[LALA]
We got your back, son!

343
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,250
Ratha! Follow it!

344
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,458
You'll be okay,
Velocidrome. I promise.

345
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,291

346
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,166
[CHEVAL]
The egg!

347
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,125
[LUTE]
Mrs. Vlau!

348
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,458
You have to go back
to the shrine!

349
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,000
The Nargacuga's on the loose!

350
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,791
I forgot something
important at home!

351
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:56,958
I have to save it!

352
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,666
[LUTE]
Mrs. Vlau!

353
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,458
[roaring]

354
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,291
[LUTE]
Ratha, attack!

355
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,208
No!

356
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,916
[LUTE]
Mrs. Vlau!

357
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,041
[roars]

358
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,291
[DAN]
Follow it!

359
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:50,041
[LUTE]
Mrs. Vlau, hello? Mrs. Vlau!

360
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:53,958
[CHEVAL]
Lute!

361
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,000
Our house. My...

362
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,541
My mom!

363
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,375
[CHEVAL]
Mom.

364
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,291
Cheval!

365
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:36,625
[NAVIROU]
<i>Monstie Manual</i> !

366
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,500
Here comes the part
where Navirou

367
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:39,958
teaches you about Monsties.

368
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,958
Now then, Navirou hopes you have

369
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,250
your Media Trigger Smart
Phone app open for this.

370
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,583
And get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

371
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:51,750
Now it's time to form a
Kinship with our Monsties!

372
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,875
The moment of new life.

373
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:56,166
Awaken!

374
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,916
[NAVIROU] Our Monstie
this time is: Nargacuga!

375
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,250
This monster is seriously fast!

376
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:06,833
Whether it's on the
ground, in the air,

377
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:09,666
or attacking you with its
razor-sharp wings and tail!

378
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,875
Riding around on a Nargacuga
would make your head spin!

379
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:17,625
Navirou can't wait to see what
Monster hatches next time!

380
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,125
[LUTE]
Hey, guys! Lute here!

381
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,583
Rathalos, the King of
the Skies, is my Monstie,

382
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:25,000
and now Cheval's making the
Queen of the Land his Monstie.

383
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,166
Good for you, buddy!

384
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,958
We're as close as
best friends get!

385
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:30,541
Next time: "A Rathian is born".

386
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:31,833
Ride On!
