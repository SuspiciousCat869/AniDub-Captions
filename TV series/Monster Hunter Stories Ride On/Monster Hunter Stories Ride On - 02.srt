00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,375
Whoa, Ratha, slow down!
You're pulling too hard!

2
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:12,125
Stop! Ratha! I said stop!

3
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:14,125
That's too close,
Lute. Be careful!

[NARRATOR]
This young boy's name is Lute,

6
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:22,583
a rash, but enthusiastic fellow
who dreams of becoming

7
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:25,666
the world's top Monster Rider.

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,208
Lute and his friends
live in Hakum Village,

9
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:31,916
a hidden enclave of
Riders, young and old.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,333
Earlier, Lute brought
Cheval and Lilia with him

11
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:37,250
deep into the woods to
help find a monster egg.

12
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,541
Lute's hope was that he and
the young creature inside

13
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:42,375
would be able to form a
deep connection, or Kinship,

14
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,416
at the next day's Kinship Rite.

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,416
Navirou was there, too!

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,583
[NARRATOR]
After much adventure,

17
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,625
including a leap
into a raging river

18
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,791
to escape a rampaging Arzuros,

19
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:56,291
Lute found an egg for a
Rathalos, the King of the Skies!

20
00:00:56,375 --> 00:01:00,500
He then hatched it, even without
having a Kinship Stone!

21
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,625
Can our boy hero Lute form
Kinship with this Rathalos

22
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:06,125
and make it his Monstie?

23
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,916
Will Cheval and Lilia be able
to hatch their own eggs

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,875
at the Kinship Rite and
have Monsties of their own?

25
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:16,375
Our new friends are taking their
first steps to becoming Riders!

26
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:19,541
The Kinship Rite starts now!

27
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,000
And don't forget all
the great things

28
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:23,458
you're about to
see from Navirou!

29
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,166
Ow. Ow. Ow.

30
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,083
You'll be fine,
just walk it off.

31
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,541
Wow, how did Ratha get so huge?

32
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,833
That surprised me, too!

33
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,541
Ratha, you're amazing!

34
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,166
I can't believe how much
you've grown in one day!

35
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,291
And so strong!

36
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,291
All right now, settle down.

37
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,166
There's still a long road
before you're a true Rider.

38
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,000
Especially when it's
a monster you hatched

39
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,875
without a proper Kinship Stone!

40
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,500
Yeah, yeah. Got it, Dan.

41
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,666
Don't disrespect me.
It's "Got it, Dan sir!"

42
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,125
I can't wait to ride you, pal.
Ratha, my Monstie!

43
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,791
This kid's gonna be trouble.

44
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,500
I'm only gonna warn you once.

45
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,125
Even if you complete today's
Kinship Rite in top form

46
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,541
and become a Rider,

47
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,500
don't let your already big
head get the better of you

48
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,416
and send you running into
the Forbidden Land!

49
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,458
You got that?

50
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,083
Yeah.

51
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,666
What do you think happened
to Dan in the Forbidden Land?

52
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,083
Beats me.

53
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,166
All right, Ratha, you
gonna let me up there?

54
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,583
Yeah?

55
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,416
Looks like you're not yet
a real team yet. How sad.

56
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,041
We're just getting started!

57
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,875
Wow, you guys, Lute's so brave.

58
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,250
He's actually
touching a Rathalos!

59
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,250
No surprise there,
right, Stone?

60
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,291
Yeah, that's Lute for you.

61
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,833
That's not being brave,
that's just reckless.

62
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,583
I better not catch you
training that way, Hyoro.

63
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,416
Right, Brother.

64
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,083
I wonder what kind of Monstie
you'll hatch, Cheval?

65
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,500
We're gonna have such a good
time at the Kinship Rite!

66
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,625
Yeah, of course.

67
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,875
I'm home, Mom!

68
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:56,458
Oh, hi, honey. Did anything
exciting happen at practice?

69
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,208
Other than Lute getting
thrown around, not really.

70
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,375
Well, that's expected
at this stage.

71
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,541
Hey. Where is Lute?

72
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,458
He'll be here as soon as
he's done feeding Ratha.

Ah. I've got breakfast
ready for you.

Sorry, Mom. But I'm
not that hungry.

Don't worry about it, honey,
it'll all work out fine.

you were a little boy,

Gargwa Soufflé always
made you feel better.

anything about being nervous.

I've known you forever, buddy.

You caught me,
I'm nervous about all this

100
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:37,125
because I'm not as
fearless as you are.

101
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:41,125
Listen to me, you are more
than brave enough to be a Rider.

But how can you really
be so sure of that?

103
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:47,291
Because you can be considerate
of a monster's feelings.

104

And plus, while you may not be
as vocal about it as I am,

deep down, I know you really
do want to become a Rider.

Demonstrate well what
you have learned

159
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,541
in your training
these many months,

160
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,750
and you shall earn
the title of Rider!

161
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,250
[KIDS]
Sir!

162
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,125
First, I shall bestow
upon each of you

163
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,041
the monster eggs
carrying your Monsties,

164
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:02,916
then I shall give you
your Kinship Stones.

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,166
Here, Cheval, as always.

166
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,583
Yes.

167
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,125
[CHIEF OMNA] Lute, since
you don't need an egg,

168
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,541
here's your Stone.

169
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,500
Yes, sir, but I mean, if you're
handing eggs out I'll--

170
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,000
Uh! No, never mind!

171
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,250
[laughs]

172
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,291
It seems to me you might
need to take some time

173
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,250
to deepen your kinship
with that Rathalos first.

174
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,291
What's the problem, buddy?
Feelin' a little less than?

175
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,208
How petty can you get?

176
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,458
[NAVIROU yelps]

177
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,541
[CHIEF OMNA]
Mille, what say you?

178
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,958
[MILLE]
I humbly accept.

179
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,333
Hyoro. Hold tightly.

180
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,833
Okay.

181
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,041
And you, Lilia,

182
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,791
here is a Kinship Stone
to go with your egg.

183
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,708
[LILIA]
Um, right. Thank you.

184
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,458
Now, I take it clever Lilia here

185
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,625
is familiar with the
rules a Rider must obey?

186
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,208
Yes.

187
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,458
Once you're a Rider,

188
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,291
you will no longer be
allowed to come and go

189
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,333
from the village as you please.

190
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,208
Do you know the reason
we have this rule?

191
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,166
To be honest, sir, I never
thought about it much.

192
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,500
I just always thought rules
are rules, and that's that.

193
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,000
But lately I've realized
the world is a big place,

194
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,958
full of things we
can't even imagine.

195
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,791
Towns nothing like
Hakum Village,

196
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,291
each one full of
different peoples,

197
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,041
including those we call Hunters.

198
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,916
There's just so much
to see out there!

199
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,125
A world to explore.

200
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,666
That's right, Lilia.

201
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,833
So now I do ask.

202
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,666
Why do we have
such strict rules?

203
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,041
Why can't Riders see the world?

204
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,583
Lilia.

205
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,250
I've never seen that
look on her face before.

206
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,791
Yeah.

207
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,416
It's not simply that Riders
cannot see or know of the world.

208
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,916
Dear girl,

209
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,375
it's about not letting the world
see or know of us Riders!

210
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,000
I know, but why?

211
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,416
[GENIE] That's something
you don't need to know

212
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,083
about right now, Lilia.

213
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,958
[CHIEF OMNA]
It's okay, Genie. Settle down.

214
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,125
It's only fair that
our aspiring Riders

215
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,458
know everything there is to know

216
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,375
about the life they
may be getting into.

217
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,583
Now please listen
close, candidates.

218
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,583
You all may find this
hard to believe,

219
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,583
having come of age
in Hakum Village,

220
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,083
but in the wider world,

221
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,083
people do not see
monsters as creatures

222
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,166
with which to have the
closeness of Kinship.

223
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,291
[LUTE]
What?

224
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,000
How could they even think that?

225
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,625
[CHIEF OMNA]
There are those in this world

226
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,916
who find us strange for
living alongside monsters,

227
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,375
even some who would fear us.

228
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:23,208
That is why we Riders spend most
of our lives in quiet seclusion.

229
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,875
That doesn't make any sense!

230
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,458
Why should we indulge
their ignorance like that?

231
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,750
It's just not fair!

232
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,791
Chief Omna, we shouldn't
have to hide!

233
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,166
You're right.

234
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,416
And that is why you're
free to live your life

235
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,250
however you choose.

[gasps]

237
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,916
Okay.

238
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,125
While I still don't know yet
what I want to do with my life,

239
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,000
I know..

240
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,791
...I won't be a Rider.

241
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:54,791
[gasps]

242
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,500
Very well.

243
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,375
Navirou's very surprised
that you're not

244
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,333
becoming a Rider, Lilia.

245
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:07,666
Oh, I know, Navirou,

246
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,083
but I just really wanna
see the world, that's all.

247
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,000
Yeah, follow your dreams, I say.

248
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,333
I always knew you'd
walk your own path.

249
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,708
That's right, Lilia.

250
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,375
And for the record,
Navirou had bet on that, too.

251
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,041
All right, you.

252
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,125
Yeah, Navirou, once again,
your act isn't fooling anyone.

00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:29,458
All right, enough! We'll now
continue the Kinship Rite.

My name is Cheval.

My name is Mille.

00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,000
My name's Hyoro.

O holy Kinship Stones,
I, Chief Omna,

261
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:47,250
call upon thee to bind together
Lute, Cheval, Mille, and Hyoro

262
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,916
with these slumbering creatures!

263
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,083
The moment of new life!

264
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,958
Awaken!

265
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,083
Ah! An Aptonoeth!

266
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,875
Look, it's a Bulldrome!

267
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,666
Those are great, you guys.

268
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,166
What Monstie did
you get, Cheval?

269
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:22,333
I don't... know what's wrong.

270
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,750
Don't worry, buddy.

271
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:27,916
Ratha wasn't exactly the
quickest guy to hatch, either.

272
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,958
Yeah, but--

273
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,166
Lute didn't have
Kinship Stones then.

274
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,875
And Lilia was the one saying
the words of the Rite.

275
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,416
It would've made more sense
if that egg didn't hatch.

276
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,583
So with yours sitting there,

277
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,000
when you're doing
everything right,

278
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,333
tells Navirou you've
got a problem.

279
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,416
Don't bring that up
right now! You be nice!

280
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,791
Hey, Navirou always says
whatever Navirou wants to say!

281
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:55,000
If Navirou wants to eat,
Navirou... eats donuts!

282
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,458
So good.

283
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,250
[sighs]

284
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,416
I guess I was right to be
nervous this morning, after all.

285
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,541
It wasn't my fate
to become a Rider.

286
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,791
Great. Cheval's depressed.
This could last a while.

287
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,625
Well, we have to do something.

288
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:12,291
Wait, I know! I'll just fix him
one of my energy drinks!

289
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,125
No, no, no. That's fine.
Let's just try to cheer him up.

290
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,500
Okay.

291
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,666
Cheval! Don't give up yet!
I know you can hatch it!

292
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,541
Just call out to the little guy.
He's probably still sleeping!

293
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,083
Come on!

294
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,791
Give it another shot. We'll get
that monster out, I promise.

295
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah, believe in
yourself, Cheval.

296
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,083
Things always work out
for you in the end, right?

297
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,208
[LILIA]
You're one to talk!

298
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,708
Why're you pulling on Navirou!

299
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,250
All Navirou did was tell
him to believe in himself?

300
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,666
It sounded pretty fake
coming from you.

302
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,958
I am not falling for that.

[NAVIROU] No, seriously!
It's, uh, it's that--

Look! It's something horrible!

305
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,458
Why's a Tigrex here?

306
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,625
We'll have to put the
Kinship Rite on hold

307
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,041
and go to the Village.

308
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:07,041
As for you Riders,
you must stop that Tigrex!

I'm not gonna argue
with it. Are you?

Listen to me closely, Cheval.

You did it, Cheval!

This monster lives in packs

and is fiercely loyal
to his friends.

You get along with
