00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:09,833
[NARRATOR]
This young boy's name is Lute,

2
00:00:09,916 --> 00:00:11,833
a rash but enthusiastic fellow,

3
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:15,583
who dreams of becoming the
world's top Monster Rider.

4
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,708
Currently, he's in the
city of Gildegaran,

5
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,875
accepting Quests from
the Hunter's Guild

6
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,333
and searching for Kinship Ore,

7
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,958
All to fight back against
the changes brought on

8
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,916
by the Black Blight.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,625
Just leave it to Navirou!

10
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,208
Good morning to you, sir!

11
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,833
Ah, morning!

12
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,250
Good morning, ma'am!

13
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,458
You're in a hurry today.

14
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,750
[LILIA]
Lute!

15
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,583
Hey, Ratha. Wait for me, Ratha.

16
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:42,666
[LUTE chuckles]

17
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,291
[NAVIROU]
Smoochy. Smoochy, smoochy.

18
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,000
What? Hey, Lute!
You're still sleeping?

19
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,666
Get up already!

20
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,125
Huh, who's that?

21
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:54,458
There's no reason for me to
be awake this early today.

22
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,750
[LUTE screams]

23
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,166
[LILIA]
Since I joined the Scriveners,

24
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,666
whenever I've had the time,

25
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,125
I've been looking through
ancient books at the library.

26
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:07,625
And that's how I stumbled
upon this promising lead.

27
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:08,500
For?

28
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,125
A Kinship Ore!

29
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,375
Whoa, where?

30
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,291
In the woods northwest
of Gildegaran.

31
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,458
They say that something
called a "Kinship Boulder"

32
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,000
is hidden right around here.

33
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:22,041
A "Kinship Boulder"? Then it's
gotta be Kinship Ore, right?

34
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,541
Exactly!

35
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,625
Hey, wake up,
Navirou! We gotta go!

36
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,416
[NAVIROU]
Smoochy, smooch, smoochy.

37
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:33,000
[NAVIROU screams]

38
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,833
Oh, good morning, Mr. Reverto!

39
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,750
We're gonna head out now!

40
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,125
Okay. Whatever.

41
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,041
[LUTE]
All right, see ya later!

42
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,958
[knocking]

43
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:55,625
Ah! Brother Reverto!
A thousand pardons, sir!

44
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:56,666
Huh...?

45
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,208
I know you made me
your apprentice,

46
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,916
and I appreciate that, but now
I wanna be a Rider instead!

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,875
Huh?

48
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,083
So, uh, anyway, is Lute around?

49
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,333
He's out.

50
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:08,083
Ah, okay then! Well--

51
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:14,958
Looks like Cheval and the others

52
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,625
already accepted a Guild
request and left for the day.

53
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,833
Well, then it can just
be the three of us.

54
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,041
Yeah, it's not too far.
Let's do it!

55
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,041
Great!

56
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,625
I packed Energy
Drinks, Potions--

57
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,958
all kinds of good stuff.

58
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,083
Danger!

59
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,583
Quest canceled!

60
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:30,791
Aww!

61
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,875
What do you mean?
C'mon! Let's go!

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,125
[MILLE]
Whoa, there's a lot of 'em.

63
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,458
[HYORO]
Way more than I expected.

64
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,458
Hey, why didn't you ask
Lute to help us out?

65
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,041
Well, I just--

66
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:52,041
The three of us can handle it.
A Quest like this is no problem.

67
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:56,958
I won't let Lute...
get the better of me.

68
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,083
Ride On!

69
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,541
Rathian!

70
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,083
Ride On!

71
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,666
Bulldrome!

72
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,083
Ride On!

73
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,583
Aptonoth!

74
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,708
Oh! That's it!

75
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,666
That's the forest on the map.

76
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,291
The Kinship Ore should
be in right in there.

77
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,833
We're now about to set foot
into a dangerous no-man's-land,

78
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,833
far from the security
of civilization.

79
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,708
It's just a regular forest.

80
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,250
What mysterious things

81
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,625
could possibly be laying in wait
for us on the journey ahead?

82
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,708
Just Kinship Ore, Navirou.

83
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,875
But Navirou promises we'll
get where we're going,

84
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,458
no matter how hard the struggle!

85
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,208
Onward, Navirou Expedition Team,

86
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,250
even if Lute and Lilia
get got on the way!

87
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,750
Hey, c'mon!

88
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,875
And what's with this "Navirou
Expedition Team" business?

89
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,666
Look there!

90
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,333
[LILIA]
What could that be?

91
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,291
[LUTE]
A village!

92
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,666
And they're all Felynes.
It's a Felyne village!

93
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,041
[NAVIROU]
Huh?

94
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,666
Navirou's gonna get the
star treatment here!

95
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,541
And you can bet on that!

96
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,708
What is this?

97
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:22,583
Mew is that?

98
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,416
And what are they doing here?

99
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,416
Mew are?

100
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,666
[NAVIROU grumbles]

101
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,625
"Mew, mew, mew. Mew"!
What an annoying place!

102
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,000
That's how Felynes
usually talk, right?

103
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,291
Oh, mew think so?

104
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,833
[COOL]
Mew, mew, mew!

105
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,166
What's this, now?

106
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,333
We rarely ever have human
visitors to our village.

107
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,791
And you are?

108
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,666
My name is Cool, and I am
the leader of Pawpad Place.

109
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,916
Now please, why don't
we go talk in my home?

110
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,083
What could that thing be?

111
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,083
Well, the other two
are humans, but--

112
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,000
How purr-plexing.

113
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,416
Ha!

114
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,083
Not surprisingly, Navirou
is the center of attention

115
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,250
among these Felynes!

116
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,750
It's a blessing and a curse.

117
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,791
Don't fall in love now!

118
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,250
[ALL]
Uhh...

119
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,625
But don't be shy, either!

120
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:15,416
Well then, please,
have a seat. Relax.

121
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,541
[LUTE, LILIA chuckle]

122
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,666
Have some tea.

123
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,250
[LUTE, LILIA chuckle]

124
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,916
[COOL]
Now, this Kinship Ore,

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,250
I've neither seen nor
heard anything about it.

126
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,708
[LILIA] It should be
within the woods here.

127
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,625
Well that happens to be
where the Felynes'

128
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,791
most sacred object is located.

129
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,833
Could you take us to go see it?

130
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,666
Humans aren't allowed to enter.

131
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,833
And why's that?

132
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,250
We Felynes consider it
to be a holy land.

133
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,541
[LUTE]
Could you make an exception?

134
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,708
Only Felynes may set foot there.

135
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,916
All right then,
just let Navirou go!

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,041
So, um, yes,
I've been wondering.

137
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,708
What is this thing?

138
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,291
"This thing"? You mean Navirou?

139
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,041
A talking stuffed animal?

140
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,916
Or perhaps some kind of pet
that's been taught to speak?

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,625
No way! Navirou's Felyne!

142
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,125
Come now, that can't
possibly be true.

143
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:10,458
Everyone knows that Felynes look
like me, not whatever you are.

144
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,666
We look the same!

145
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,250
No, no, no.

146
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,125
All us Felynes have
sharply set eyes.

147
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,041
Sharp eyes.

148
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,583
Perky whiskers!

149
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,291
Perky.

150
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,000
A slim, willowy figure.

151
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,166
Willowy!

152
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,916
Y'know, when you look
at them like that,

153
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,541
Navirou's really not
very Felyne-y at all.

154
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,708
Why would you undermine
him like that, Lute?

155
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,791
And a paw print
pattern on the chest!

156
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:31,750
Paw print!

157
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,000
Ah.

158
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,250
Well, I suppose that's
Felyne-esque at least.

159
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,708
"-Esque" nothing!

160
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,750
Navirou is a full-blooded
Felyne, through and through!

161
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,833
And what's more, he's
everyone's idealized version

162
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,041
of what a Felyne can be!

163
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,500
[COOL]
Huh.

164
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,708
Who knew there were other
kinds of Felynes out there.

Though I guess the world
is a pretty big place.

166
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,208
Now that you accept
that Navirou is a Felyne,

167
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,416
take him to this sacred object!

We can't just let any Felyne in.

You have to be a member
of this village.

The villagers here,

they all had to perform
the Coming-of-Age Rite.

Now they're recognized
as full members.

So then, if you were to undergo
this Rite, you'd be one of us.

Ugh. What a pain.

And that's a Navi-rule.

I hereby bestow upon you
this Felyne Bone Wedge.

325
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,875
So does this mean Navirou's
part of the village now?

326
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,291
It means the time has
come for the final Rite.

Do what now?

330
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,875
Your task is to bring us
a Genprey Fang.

You're asking for
the impossible!

You know,

come to think of it, Navirou,
I've never seen you fight.

334
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,291
That's because
Navirou's talented

00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,000
at giving orders from behind!

He's too skilled to be
put on the front line!

337
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:46,958
Very well. In that case,
you'll never be a villager.

338
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:50,416
C'mon, Number Five! Help me!

Does this mean you're

Demondrug.

you my Monstie!

you, by chance, a Rider?

Do you have to be so amazed?

Wait a second, does this mean

that you're a Rider's

Nope, not a Monstie.

aren't you, Navi?

Please let me take you to
the Felynes' hallowed ground!

I'd be honored!

your sacred object now?

[LILIA] Hey, is this
a monument to Redan?

399
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,416
[COOL] Ah, I see you're
familiar with the story.

400
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,291
As you know, Redan
was a legendary Rider,

401
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,500
but this particular
monument was put here

402
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,791
to honor the Felyne who
served him as his Monstie.

403
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:01,083
[LUTE] So Redan had a
Felyne by his side, too!

404
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,291
It's definitely not
Kinship Ore, though.

405
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,875
[COOL] The brave Felyne who
loyally supported Redan

406
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:13,500
on his adventures formed a
powerful Kinship with humans.

407
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:17,208
And so, this sacred object
represents the Kinship

408
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,583
between our two kinds.

409
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,375
Ah! That's why it's
the Kinship Boulder!

[NAVIROU]

456
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,458
Here comes the
part where Navirou

teaches you about Monsties.

Now then, Navirou hopes you have

your Media Trigger Smart

And get your eggs out,

Gendrome's the leader
of the Genprey pack.

It paralyzes its prey with
its sharp claws and fangs.

made it through the Rite,

he can handle these
monsters just fine!
