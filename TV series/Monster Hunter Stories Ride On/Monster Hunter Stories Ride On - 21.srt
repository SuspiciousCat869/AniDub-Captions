00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:09,458
[NARRATOR]
This young boy's name is Lute,

2
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:11,458
a rash but enthusiastic fellow,

3
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:14,166
who dreams of becoming
the world's top Monster Rider.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,708
And he's Navirou's top pupil!

5
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:20,125
[NARRATOR] After visiting Pawpad
Place for info on Kinship Ore,

6
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,375
Navirou faced
one trial after another!

7
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:25,833
And overcame them all
with his genius!

8
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:27,541
[NARRATOR]
And now a new day begins,

9
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,958
with a request that will
lead to a new adventure

10
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:33,250
for Lute, Navirou,
and all their friends!

11
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,458
[LUTE]
What?

12
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:37,125
Now Simone and the Scriveners
want us to do a Quest for them?

13
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,375
You're sure they want us
instead of Hunters?

14
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,000
Yep! In fact, it's because
you're all Riders

15
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,083
that Simone requested
your services--

16
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,125
Uh, I mean the Captain.

17
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,250
What is it?

18
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,375
There's a good chance it's
related to the Black Blight.

19
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,208
Where is it hitting now?

20
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,458
[LILIA]
It might be hard to believe,

21
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,125
but until just a few years ago,

22
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,041
this vast desert
was as lush and as green

23
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,916
as the forests around it.

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,333
[ALL gasp]

25
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,750
[LILIA] The cause seems to be
a mysterious quicksand

26
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,416
that's consuming
everything in its path.

27
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,291
As the desert spreads,

28
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,916
the monsters are starting
to vanish too.

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,916
So the population's thinning.

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,125
Yeah.

31
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,375
[CHEVAL]
And somehow, the Black Blight's

32
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,166
connected to this quicksand?

33
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,000
Possibly. The Scrivener's
believe it is,

34
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,458
but they're not certain yet.

35
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,000
So to confirm it either way,

36
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,458
I'd like to go with you
into the desert.

37
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,291
[MILLE] You sure?
It's gonna be dangerous.

38
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,333
If the Black Blight's
behind this quicksand,

39
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,333
I'll do anything to stop it.

40
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,833
That's right.

41
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,291
Yeah.

42
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,875
[HYORO] Have the Scriveners
found any actual evidence

43
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,250
that Black Blight's involved?

44
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,291
[ALL]
Uuh...

45
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,958
In the towns
on the desert's edge,

46
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,000
the villagers have been talking.

47
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,541
Rumors about black monsters

48
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,583
coming out of
the sands at night.

49
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,375
So large that they
hide the moon from view.

50
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,041
Black monsters.

51
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,625
[CHEVAL]
It has to be the Blight.

52
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,583
There's no doubt about it!

53
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,916
I agree, and that's why
I'm coming with you.

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,416
There's a camp called Oasum
that's full of refugees

55
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,166
who have lost
their homes to the desert.

56
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,750
We can stop there
to hear their stories

57
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,833
of the Blighted monsters.

58
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,291
Let's go!

59
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,750
[SIMONE] "I'm sure you
must have seen or heard by now.

60
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,208
There reports of drastic,
environmental changes

61
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,291
in the Desert Lands.

62
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,583
Based on the evidence,
we believe the Black Blight

63
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,750
to be responsible
for this phenomenon,

64
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:32,250
just as it was the cause of
the incident in Hakum Village.

65
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,625
Therefore, I am asking
for the Rider's help,

66
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:38,125
launching an independent
investigation into the matter.

67
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,333
I know you originally
come from a desert village,

68
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,125
so I thought it
important to update you.

69
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,416
P.S. I hear that
your current Quest

70
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,166
is an Desert Island
Grand Hunt-a-Thon.

71
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,291
I know it's not
my place to give advice,

72
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,708
but don't try too hard."

73
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,166
Uh.

74
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,333
[REVERTO]
In other words:

75
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:59,291
"Finish it up
and go help the kids."

76
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,708
[LILIA]
Okay. This should be

77
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,916
enough gear for
a few days in the desert.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,625
No, you forgot the single
most important item!

79
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:06,708
What's that?

80
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,958
Donuts, of course!

81
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,958
I put Mille and Hyoro
in charge of packing

82
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,416
all the provisions.

83
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,833
They should be meeting us
back here any minute.

84
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,208
--[LUTE] Oh! There they are!
--[NAVIROU] Huh?

85
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,916
[LUTE] Well, they definitely
got a lot of something!

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,666
[NAVIROU]
Ooh!

87
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,791
Navirou can't handle
the mystery any longer!

88
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,291
Open up those bags and
give him all the donuts!

89
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,958
The only thing
Lilia had on the list

90
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,583
were standard field rations
and Well-Done Steak.

91
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:31,666
Yeah.

92
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,750
You're kidding. No donuts.

93
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,916
Navirou will die!

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,166
Huh? Donut!

95
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,666
That should cheer you up.

96
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,583
Hooray, Cheval! Navirou's
top pupil comes through!

97
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,666
[CHEVAL laughing]
Navirou, you're heavy.

98
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,250
[NAVIROU]
Don't hold back now!

99
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,125
Pet Navirou
as much as you'd like!

100
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,500
Oh good, he's back to normal.

101
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,041
[MILLE]
Cheval?

102
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,958
When I was mentioning
the Black Blight earlier,

103
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,583
he just didn't
seem like himself.

104
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:05,291
[LUTE] I guess. He just wants
to stop the Black Blight.

105
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,250
[LILIA]
Yeah.

106
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,666
Check, check, and check!

107
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,166
Everything's accounted
for and packed up.

108
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,000
We'll hit the road first thing
tomorrow morning, okay?

109
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,500
[ALL]
Mm!

110
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,833
The desert can be
a really unforgiving place,

111
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,291
so, everyone,
get plenty of rest tonight.

112
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,125
This is so cool, Lilia.

113
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,666
It's like you're a
full fledged scrivener now!

114
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,083
Yeah, not really.

115
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,666
And you look like a natural
in that uniform too!

116
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,000
[laughs]

117
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,625
I'm just an apprentice,
you guys, but thank you!

118
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,958
As expected from
Navirou's top pupil!

119
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:39,083
What? How many top pupils
do you have, Navirou?

120
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,500
[ALL laugh]

121
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,750
[NAVIROU] As many as there are!
And that's a Navi-rule.

122
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,000
[LUTE]
What part of that is a rule?

123
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,625
[MILLE]
That doesn't even make sense.

124
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:47,541
[HYORO]
Yeah.

125
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,000
[NAVIROU]
Aaah!

126
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,375
It could pose a real
danger to your flowerbed.

127
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,708
And so it goes.

128
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,500
If that happens,
I'll just plant more seeds.

129
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,750
The garden will bloom again.

[LILIA]
Hey, there you are.

133
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,375
I got worried when
I didn't see you at the Inn.

134
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,750
[CHEVAL]
Sorry.

135
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,291
Trouble sleeping?

136
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,500
Well, don't feel bad.
I can't sleep at all, either.

137
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,875
I'm representing the
Scriverners on this journey.

138
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,875
It's a big responsibility.

139
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,875
Ah! I'm so nervous, Cheval!

140
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:37,583
You'll be fine, Lilia.
Take deep breaths.

141
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:40,916
You've been
telling me to do that

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,041
ever since we were
little kids, Cheval.

143

[inhales, exhales]

00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,166
[LILIA]
Yep. Still works.

145
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,250
C'mon, now you try it.

146
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,041
[CHEVAL]
Wait, why me?

147
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,208
[LILIA]
Why not?

148
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,291
[MILLE, LILIA yawn]

149
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:07,166
Hey, were you guys up late?

150
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,625
I was too nervous
about today to sleep.

151
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:13,208
--You, too?
--What? No, I feel fine.

152
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,958
According to this, we'll be
in the desert lands soon.

153
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,458
Oh! Then we should stop here

154
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,791
so I can make each
of us a Cool Drink.

155
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,916
Are these gonna be gross?

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,250
[CHEVAL]
I'm not sure.

157
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,083
But at least they'll help us
handle the desert heat.

Just gimme a second, guys.

159

These Cool Drinks have
a few tricky ingredients.

160
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,458
[ALL gasp]

161
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,916
I'm mixing a new combination

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,541
that I learned
from Captain Simone.

163
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,500
It's so tasty,
it'll knock your socks off!

164
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,958
[LILIA humming]

165
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,875
Done! Bottom's up!

166
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,083
[ALL]
Eeeh...

167
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,500
I made plenty, so don't be shy!

168
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,708
And remember, you guys,

169
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,625
restraint is hazardous
to your health!

170
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,458
[LUTE]
Cheval!

171
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,333
Let's drink ours together!

172
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,000
[BOTH]
One. Two.

173
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,833
[BOTH laughing]

174
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,875
Oh, well, that wasn't so--

175
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,083
Blaaah! It takes
a second to kick in!

176
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,791
Nasty!

177
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,416
[MILLE]
Cheval's frozen!

178
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,458
[HYORO]
Um, are you okay?

179
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,750
[laughs]

180
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,833
It's so delicious,
he's positively speechless!

181
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,583
You're so delusional!

182
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,791
It's a crime
you can't see the truth!

183
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,250
Here, Lilia,
why don't you try it!

184
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:36,500
Okay...
[slurps]

185
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,416
Now, watch, that gross
aftertaste will kick in--

186
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,291
Oh, it's even
better than I thought!

187
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,583
I could drink this all the time!

188
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,250
[LUTE, CHEVAL groan]

189
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,166
[LILIA]
All right, guys! You're next!

190
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,750
[HYORO]
Eh!

191
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,333
[HYORO, MILLE groan]

192
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,000
[LILIA]
You, too, Navirou!

193
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,458
Navirou's eating only donuts
for the duration of this trip!

194
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,250
You aren't you worried
about the desert drying you out?

195
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,333
Navirou has
a body of steel! Observe.

196
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,000
A little heat's never
slowed down this fit Felyne!

197
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,333
[chuckles]

198
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,625
[CHEVAL] Y'know, taste aside,
that Cool Drink really worked.

199
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,458
[HYORO]
Good thing we all gave in, huh?

200
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,041
[MILLE] I don't know.
My tongue is still tingling.

201
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,750
[LUTE] Well, if we didn't drink
it, we'd be parched and weak.

202
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,583
It'd be awful!
[laughs]

203
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,541
C'mon, buddy, no one's
gonna look down on you

204
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,208
if just swallow your pride
and have a Cool Drink.

205
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,041
Navirou would rather
wither away to nothingness

206
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,500
than swallow that stuff.

207
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,791
[NAVIROU]
An oasis!

208
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,875
Once again, Navirou's expert
sense of direction

209
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,625
has saved you all!

210
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,833
[LUTE]
Navirou!

211
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:46,000
That's not an oasis! Come back!

212
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,750
[NAVIROU]
What? Where's the water?

213
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,333
[LILIA]
Navi, get out!

214
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,291
[LILIA]
A Barroth!

215
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,250
[roars]

216
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,583
Ride On!

217
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,291

[wailing]

219
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,916
Navirou, you have to
stop struggling!

220
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,750
He's already pretty deep
in that mud!

221
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,791
[MILLE grunting]

222
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,083
Navirou knew you'd never let

223
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,416
your fearless leader
drown out here!

224
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,375
[BOTH grunting]

225
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,458
Careful you guys!

226
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,625
Barroth has the ability
to fling mud!

227
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,541
Don't let it hit you!

228
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,750
Because that mud
will cement you in place.

229
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,375
[MILLE, HYORO groaning]

230
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,541
[LUTE]

[LUTE]
It's Cheval!

238
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
[LILIA]
It's a cleanser!

239
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,625
Grab on!

240
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,750
I owe ya one, Lilia.

241
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,708
[BARROTH roars]

00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,500
Cheval! This one's not Blighted!

244
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,583
It's just scared because
we disturbed its den!

245
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,916
[CHEVAL]
I will stop it!

[gasps]

250
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,916
It's caught in the Shock Trap!

251
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,416
[MILLE] Now use these
Tranq Bombs to put it to sleep!

252
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,666
Right!

253
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,208
[HYORO]
All right!

254
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,875
Please don't celebrate until
Navirou's back on solid ground.

255
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,250
[KIDS]
Oh.

256
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,291
You're lucky we were able
to get you out of there!

257
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,041
Navirou can't believe
you completly forgot about him!

258
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,166
How cruel!

259
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,250
Come on Navi,
let's get that mud off.

260
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,125
You do realize all of this
would have been avoided

261
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:13,000
if you just had a Cool Drink
like the rest of us.

262
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:17,000
[NAVIROU sobbing]

263
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,000
So what, are we gonna do
with the Barroth now?

264
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,750
[LILIA] Well, since it
doesn't appear to be infected

265
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,291
with the Black Blight,

266
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,291
it's best if we let the Guild
decide how to handle things.

267
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,708
As for us, once we
get through this valley,

268
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,916
the road to Oasum splits in two.

269
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,500
According to the map,
the mountain route

270
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,083
is pretty treacherous.

271
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,250
And there are no oases
along the way.

272
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,500
Don't worry, Lilia.

273
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,750
I don't mind checking out
that route for us.

274
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,416
[LILIA]
But you can't go alone!

275
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,666
[MILLE]
Then I'll go, too.

276
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,833
Me too.

277
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,500
Aw, thanks, guys.
I'll fell a lot better

278
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,500
with you two coming along.

279
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,083
Great! And while you do that,

280
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,916
Lute and I will take
the route through the Valley

281
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,166
and hand over
the Barroth to the Guild.

282
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,208
[LUTE] Mmmm! This is
gonna be so ultra tasty!

283
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,875
--[NAVIROU] Yoink! Ha-ha!
--[LUTE] Hey!

284
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,250
--What a feast!
--[LUTE] Give it back!

285
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,625
You won't get one bite!

286
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,875
[NAVIROU]
Not fair!

287
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,083
You can't tempt Navirou
with something so tasty!

288
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,416
It's Navirou's!

289
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,375
I didn't make it for you!

290
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,166
[NAVIROU] We need to
settle all food scores,

291
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,333
right here right now!
Let Navirou eat that!

292
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,875
[LUTE] No way! Forget it!
You never make any sense!

293
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,041
[NAVIROU]
Give it to Navirou!

294
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:40,291
[CHEVAL gasping]

295
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:44,041
[CHEVAL]
Mom. Mom.

296
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:48,833
[MILLE]
Cheval? Cheval! Cheval!

297
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,625
Are you okay? What's wrong?

298
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,708
Cheval?

299
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,666
Bad dream.

300
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:04,833
[CHEVAL] I've been dreaming
about that night a lot lately.

301
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:08,500
And now, when I see
a Monster attack someone,

302
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:12,416
I get angry, and this rage
wells up from inside me.

303
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,125
At this point,
it's almost a reflex.

304
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:21,500
I don't want what happened to me
to happen to anyone else.

305
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,083
Maybe we should
go out of our way

306
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,083
to defeat monsters
who hurt people.

307
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,000
Well, if that feels right,

308
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:34,166
then it's probably best
if you follow your instincts.

309
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,166
The Nargacuga
changed things for all of us.

310
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,958
You're thinking about
taking a new path.

311
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,041
Lilia joined the Scriveners
and is tracking the Blight.

312
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:47,583
Hyoro's become braver
and stronger, in his own way.

313
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,708
And there's Lute, whose dreams
have only gotten bigger.

314
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:58,166
[MILLE] I'd like to
find my own path, too.

315
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,250
[CHEVAL]
You will find it, Mille.

316
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,125
I know you can.

317
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,875
Believe in yourself.

318
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,083
[MILLE]
Thank you, Cheval.

319
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,625
Eeeh...

320
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,208
For the road, buddy!

321
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,750
You sure?

322
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,250
Last night, you seemed pretty
happy it turned out so well.

323
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,500
Well, of course!

324
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,625
It tastes great, though
nothing can ever compare

325
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,208
to the dishes
Mrs. Vlau would make.

326
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,583
Thanks, Lute.

327
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,000
[LILIA] And here's
an Energy Drink from me.

328
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,750
If you feel tired
or under-the-weather,

329
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,416
drink this and you'll perk
right back up, good as new!

330
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,750
Don't drink it, it'll just
make you feel worse. Right?

331
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:48,958
[chuckles]

332
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,000
What? You want some, too?

333
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,333
Oh, no, no, no.

334
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,125
I couldn't take
Cheval's Energy Drink.

335
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,125
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

336
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,583
It's okay!

337
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,833
I already mixed up a huge
pitcher of it, just for you!

338
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,250
Thank you for that, Navirou!

339
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,666
Uh, well, it's the thought
that counts I guess.

340
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,000
Doesn't it though?
Now, don't be shy!

341
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,250
I'm not shy--
what are you talking about?

342
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:14,583
[laughing]

343
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,875
Be careful out there, guys!

344
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,250
[MILLE]
You, too.

345
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,208
Right! Meet you in Oasum, Lute!

346
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,750
Yeah! I bet we
beat you guys there!

347
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,833
Fine, then it's a race.

348
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,875
Stay safe out there, kids!

349
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,041
Same to you, bye!

350
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,541
Well, we better get a-move-on!

351
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,750
[LILIA]
Right!

352
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:41,833
[NAVIROU]
Mm!

353
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,041
What the--?

354
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,250
No way.

355
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,583
It's gone.

356
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,541
I swear,
the Barroth was just here!

357
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,791
So where did it go?

358
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,125
[DR. MANELGER]
It's our lucky day, Itsy-Bits!

359
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,041
We snagged ourselves a Barroth,

360
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,708
without getting our hands dirty!

361
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,416
It's all thanks to
your genius, Dr. Manelger.

362
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,583
Once again, you've pulled off
your signature move:

363
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,916
The Ol' Switcheroo!

364
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,208
You, sir, are
an inspiration! Bravo!

365
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:10,000
Save some of that praise for the
victories to come, Itsy-Bits!

366
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,875
Stealing this Barroth
is but the first step

367
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,583
as we begin my larger plan

368
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,958
for an unprecedented
revolution with Monsters!

369
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,791
[laughing]

370
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,375
[ITSY-BITS] Doctor, look!
The ground is moving!

371
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,458
[DR. MANELGER] Mm? Ah, yes.
Quicksand. Quite deadly!

372
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:28,041
As long as we don't fly too
close, though, we'll be fine.

373
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,916
Huh? What's that?

374
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,916
Whoa, it is our lucky day!

375
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,458
First a Barroth,
and now a Diablos!

376
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:39,250
The gods smile on me.
They smile on me, I say!

377
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,791
A fact so important
you repeated it twice!

378
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,166
Itsy-Bits!

379
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,500
Procure the Diablos,
post-haste!

380
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,000
[ITSY-BITS]
But you said quicksand is deadly

381
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,583
if we get too close!

382
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,958
[DR. MANELGER] 'Tis the common
man who holds his life so dear!

[BOTH chuckle]

384
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,833
[ITSY-BITS]
Doctor! That's not a Diablos!

385
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:04,750
That's a Plum Daimyo Hermitaur
wearing a Diablos shell!

386
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,458
[DR. MANELGER, ITSY-BITS yell]

[HYORO]
Where's Cheval?

399
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:04,375
[CHIEF OMNA] You must never
forget the Riders' Laws.

400
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,958
Our humble lives unfold
only by the grace of nature.

401
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:11,166
In many ways,
we are a part of it.

402
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,041
Therefore, you must never
take life unnecessarily,

403
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:17,666
you must protect
and love all life.

[CHEVAL] The only thing
that will stop these tragidies

405
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,833
is strength. Great strength!

406
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,500
And an iron will!

Oh, he's good.
Very good in fact!

411
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:23,250
I think we'll
get along just fine.

[NAVIROU]
<i>Monstie Manual</i> !

414
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,166
Here comes the part
where Navirou

415
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,750
teaches you about Monsties.

416
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,625
Now then, Navirou hopes you have

417
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:44,000
your Media Trigger Smart
Phone app open for this.

418

And get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

419
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:50,458
Now it's time to form a
Kinship with our Monsties!

[NAVIROU] Our Monstie
this time is: Barroth!

Run into one of these
in the wild

424

and you'll jump
outta your shoes!

It uses the mud on its body
for both offense and defense!

To top it off, that bony head
crest has major crushing power!

427
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:17,041
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!

but now a conflict's brewing
between Riders and Hunters.
