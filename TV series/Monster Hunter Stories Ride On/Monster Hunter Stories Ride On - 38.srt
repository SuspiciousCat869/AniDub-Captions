These youngsters are Riders,

00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:12,125
on a quest to track down
blackened Kinship Ore

and stop the Black Blight that's
been spreading across the world.

That mission was
brought close to home

when Manelger's scheming caused
Hakum Village's Kinship Ore

to be taken over by the Blight.

In the fallout,

slay a Blighted Tigrex

Thinking back to that day,

the day when you first
stumbled upon Ratha's egg...

You were ignorant of the

out how I might feel.

could save the village...

00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,250
[RATHI cries]

321
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:45,750
What could I do? What else
should I have done?

322
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:49,541
There's nothing anyone can do.
He's found his own path.

323
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,416
[LILIA]
But...

324
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,791
Chief Omna, weren't
you telling us earlier

325
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:58,541
how all of the Riders' paths
will eventually become one?

326
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,666
Tell me, Lute, as a Rider,

327
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,541
what do you believe in
more than anything?

328
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:10,375
The power of Kinship.

329
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:13,791
Ah, but do you know
what kind of power Kinship is?

330
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:19,666
Just as I thought, you still
have much to learn, my dear boy.

331
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:26,083
You can start at the sacred
place: The Tower of Illusion.

332
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:36,500
[NAVIROU]
<i>Monstie Manual</i> !

333
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,500
Here comes the part
where Navirou

334
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,000
tells you about Monsties.

335
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,041
All right, Navirou
hopes you have

336
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,208
your Media Trigger
Smart Phone app open.

337
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,625
Better get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

338
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:51,833
And now, it's time to form
a Kinship with our Monsties!

339
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,916
The moment of new life!

340
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,208
Awaken!

341
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:03,041
[NAVIROU] Our Monstie this
time is: Great Jaggi!

342
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:04,708
The alpha leader
of a Jaggi herd

343
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:07,875
can be a real doozy when
teamed up with their underlings.

344
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:10,416
These monsters expertly
use combo attacks

345
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,875
with the right power, speed,
and technique for any job.

346
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:17,000
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!

347
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,875
[LUTE] We're on our way
to a mysterious place

348
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:21,125
to learn more about the
power of Kinship and--

349
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:23,083
Whoa, time's been turned back?

350
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,833
Next time: "Tested at
the Tower of Illusion"!

351
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:26,916
Ride On!
