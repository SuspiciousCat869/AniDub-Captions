00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:09,833
[NARRATOR]
The Felyne's name is Navirou!

2
00:00:09,916 --> 00:00:11,916
He's the stalwart
companion to Lute,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,875
a rash but
enthusiastic young boy,

4
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:17,333
who dreams of becoming the
world's top Monster Rider.

5
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:20,000
The two first met years
ago in Hakum Village,

6
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:22,208
and in the time since,
have formed a loving,

7
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,291
albeit strange, relationship.

8
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,500
As Lute has become
a full-fledged Rider,

9
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:29,083
the unusual Navirou has
never left his side,

10
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,458
serving as a cheerleader,
comedy partner,

11
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:34,166
and all-around right-hand man.

12
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,333
But most interesting
of all is that Navirou

13
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:39,833
has no memory of where he's
from, or of his early life.

14
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:43,333
Nevertheless, Navirou's overcome
obstacle after obstacle,

15
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:46,041
thanks to his playful
optimism, can-do attitude,

16
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,791
and plenty of donuts.

17
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,916
He and Lute will follow
each other anywhere,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,250
including the deadly and
dangerous Dovan Volcano.

19
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,583
Unfortunately, while
searching for a Kinship Ore

20
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,166
in the mountain,

21
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,375
the duo--and Debli-- triggered
one of Doctor Manelger's traps.

22
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,250
Now prisoners in
the evil doctor's

23
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,666
subterranean laboratory,

24
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,125
they've discovered a group
of super-powered Felynes

25
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,750
calling themselves,
"The Numbers."

26
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:13,083
And at long last, Navirou's
lost memories came back.

27
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,875
He remembered his original
identity as "Number Five"

28
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,291
and learned the shocking truth

29
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,125
about the super
power modification

30
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:23,500
given to him by the
monster-mechanizing Manelger.

31
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,125
Rediscovering his past has
made Navirou determined

32
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:30,041
to take down the evil doctor
and free his old friends!

33
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,875
There's something
Navirou has to do first.

34
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:38,625
Settle the score with Manelger!

35
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:40,416
Okay, Lute, you're up!

36
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,083
Ride On!

37
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:45,166
Rathalos!

38
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,291
Numbers, charge!

39
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:08,583

40
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,000

[gasps]

42
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,500
What's the plan?

43
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,625
The plan is we use this tank.

44
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,750
You heard him, Spex,
get ready to fire!

45
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,583
[SPEX]
Angle set! Locked and loaded!

46
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,416
You might wanna cover
your ears, big boy.

47
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,500
Fire!

48
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,750
What was that?

49
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,708
What was what?

50

[gasps]

51

[LUTE]
You guys, look!

52
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,125
It's Kinship Ore.

53
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,916
Well, well, I see the
Rider is still on the hunt.

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,875
What do you think? A marvelous
specimen is it not?

55
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,208
This Kinship Ore will
soon allow me to control

56
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:09,041
all the monsters of the world!

57
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,250
And on that note,
I'd like to ask you a favor.

58
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,041
In order to maximize
the Ore's power,

59
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,666
I need a Rider's Kinship
Stone, to understand

60
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,666
how the various connections
between them work.

61
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,916
Now, be a good Rider, my boy,

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,625
and let me borrow
your Stone for a bit.

63
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,000
In your dreams!

64
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,583
I'll never help you
mind-control monsters!

65
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,375
That's right! They form
Kinship with them!

66
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,791
[DR. MANELGER]
Hm. All right then.

67
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,208
Guess I'll have to
do this the hard way.

68
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,458
Not so fast.

69
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,291
We're the ones pointing
a cannon at you, Doctor!

70
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,833
Now we have the upper hand!

71
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,750
You don't stand a chance
against the Meownzer tank!

72

Your experimenting
days are done!

73
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,625

experimented on long ago.

[LUTE] No! Rathalos,
what's happening to you?

323
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,291
[NAVIROU] You think
Ratha's gonna be okay?

324
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:39,291
He'll be fine,
he's just resting.

325
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,708
Thank you for saving us.

326
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:45,375
But how did you know exactly
where to find us, Avinia?

327
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,750
I heard there was a Kinship Ore

328
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,875
somewhere around
the Dovan Volcano.

329
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:52,500
So I came here to find out if
it was infected with the Blight.

330
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,333
And I saw you guys.

331
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,958
That's pretty lucky! Thank you!

332
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,416
Sure!

00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,333
[NAVIROU yelps]

334
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:04,583
Ratha?

335
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,750
Is the Blight coming back?

336
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,916
[AVINIA]
Ratha will be fine.

337
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,250
All this time, his
body's been fighting

338
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:15,250
to keep the Black Blight
from completely taking over.

339
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,166
It must've been so hard.

340
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,458
You mean the Blight isn't new?

341
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,083
[LUTE] Ratha, what's wrong?
C'mon, pull up!

342
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,791
Ratha's been so sick...
and I didn't notice.

343
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,375
Ratha being sick also explains

344
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,916
why he didn't come
when you called.

345
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,208
Ratha, don't worry,
I'm here for you now.

346
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,875
I won't leave till
you're all better!

347
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,208
[LUTE chuckles]

348

[LUTE]
I like petting you, too, bud.

349
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,041
In a way, you are
kinda Ratha's dad.

The Volcano's erupting again!

354
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,250
Your Rathalos has been
afflicted with the Blight.

355
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,375
It must be destroyed.

356
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,333
Cheval, no.

<i>The Book of Numbers</i> !

358
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,708
Hey, it's me, Lilia of
the Royal Scriveners,

359
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,708
with an analysis of the
Felynes in the Numbers.

360
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:45,166
Here's who we're
covering this week.

361
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,083
[LILIA]
Number Four, Spex.

362
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:52,041
This bespectacled Felyne is
the brains of the Numbers

363
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:55,500
and has the traits
of the Kecha Wacha.

364
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:58,541
Number Five, our
ol' friend Navirou.

365
00:22:58,625 --> 00:22:59,916
With his lightning attacks,

366
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,083
this chatty Felyne takes
after the monster, Zinogre.

367
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:07,166
And finally, Number Six, Floof.

368
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,583
This fuzzy-cutie
is like a Basarios

369
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:12,583
and can exhale sleeping gas.

Hey, it's me, Lute!

373
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:21,458
What are you doing, Cheval?

374
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:23,458
I thought we were like family!

375
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:26,875
Ratha isn't Blighted anymore!

376

Next time: "Parting Ways."
