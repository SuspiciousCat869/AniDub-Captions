where Navirou

478
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:39,958
teaches you about Monsties.

479
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:42,000
Now then, Navirou hopes you have

480
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,250
your Media Trigger Smart
Phone app open for this.

481
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,666
And get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

482
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:51,541
Now, it's time to form a
Kinship with our Monsties!

483
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,666
The moment of new life.

484
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,958
Awaken!

485
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:01,333
[NAVIROU] Our Monstie
this time is: Bulldrome!

486
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:03,708
They sure have huge
tusks, don't they?

487
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:06,875
A regular Bullfango can't
hold a candle to these giants!

488
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,166
They're so strong and fearless,

489
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,291
they charge headlong
into their prey!

490
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:13,875
Even other Monsties tremble
at the Bulldrome's power!

491
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:17,583
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!

492
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,083
[LUTE]
Hey, guys, Lute here!

493
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:20,958
Up to now, Dan's just
been our trainer,

494
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,041
the guy always harpin' on us

495
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:24,041
to improve our
Kinship with Monsties.

496
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,333
But what's this?
Dan has a secret?

497
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,750
Next time:
"Dan and Silva's Zeal"!

498
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:30,375
Ride On!
