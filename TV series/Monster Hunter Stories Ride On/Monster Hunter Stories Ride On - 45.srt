00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,416
[NARRATOR]
These youngsters are Riders,

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,958
on a quest to track down
blackened Kinship Ore

3
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:17,250
and stop the Black Blight that's
been spreading across the world.

4
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,791
Having learned about
a Kinship Ore

5
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:20,958
located in the
Forest of Confusion,

6
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,708
Lute followed lightning
strikes to the den of Kirin,

7
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,291
an Elder Dragon.

8
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,833
However, Lute discovered
that the Kinship Ore there

9
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:30,791
was untainted by
the Black Blight.

10
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:33,041
The Kirin had kept it safe.

11
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,750
After conveying its intentions
to Lute through Navirou,

12
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,416
the beast disappeared
into the forest.

13
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:49,208
Huh? What is it Lilia?

14
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,833
We've seen murals
of Redan before.

15
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,666
Yeah? Well, I haven't.

16
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,541
So what does it say?

17
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:59,458
"An ebon donut was
burned upon the edges,

18
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,916
a donut white came
forth undercooked."

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,333
You really only care
about one thing.

20
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,250
"In the beginning
was the Awakening.

21
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,916
When an ebon darkness
is born upon the Earth,

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,291
a dragon white will come forth
at the base of a great tree."

23
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:13,958
[NAVIROU]
Oh, yeah! That!

24
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,500
"Two Kinships, joined.

25
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:19,333
Bound together. The Hunter
becomes the Rider.

26
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:22,458
When there is Kinship,
there is light.

27
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,916
When there is no Kinship,
there is darkness.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,958
The Black Dread,
born of the darkness

29
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:32,208
will stain the earth
as blackest jet."

30
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:36,416
Come to think of it,
we never did find out

31
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,291
what that Black Dread
thing was about.

32
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:39,833
That's right, though
you gotta figure

33
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:42,375
it's probably something
both black and dreadful.

34
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,583
I wonder if this tablet
could be showing us

35
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,458
where to find all
of the Kinship Ore.

36
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:47,708
Huh?

37
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,708
[SIMONE]
The Kinship Ore?

38
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:48,875
[LILIA]
That's right.

39
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,125
It looks like each
sectioned-off block here

40
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,000
is showing the location
of another Kinship Ore.

41
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,958
Ah, yes, I see it now.

42
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,750
Let's compare them
against the old maps

43
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,791
we have back at the
Scriveners' office.

44
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,583
Okay, so if this
thing is divided up

45
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,708
into seven segments,
do you think that means

46
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,833
there are seven
Kinship Ore in total?

47
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,791
How many have we found so far?

48
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:11,708
The Forest of Confusion, and,
um... Where else have we been?

49
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,625
Why don't we head
back and check?

50
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,291
All right. Lieutenant Pappan?

51
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,666
Ma'am?

52
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,458
I'd like for you to go
join up with our detachment.

53
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,291
Aye, roger that!

54
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,208
What detachment?

55
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:25,416
They're searching for
Dr. Manelger's whereabouts.

56
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,708
Look there! It's Cheval!

57
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,708
Cheval, my boy!

58
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,708
[DR. MANELGER] We've been
searching all over for you!

59
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,416
Gathering intel from
Hunters and Felynes alike,

60
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,583
and here, at long last,
we've finally found you!

61
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,000
What do you want?

62
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,916
Oh, come on, cheer up!

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,500
My Mecha Kinship Stone
is fully operational now!

64
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,541
So, Cheval, you've been rather
reckless on your Quest

65
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,000
to find a mighty Monstie
that you can make your own.

66
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,708
But that all ends today!
Your search is over!

67
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,000
Why, with this Mechinship Stone,

68
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:24,541
that legendary white dragon
will be yours in no time!

69
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,375
And you're telling the truth?

70
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,250
Oh-ho, you bet I am!

71
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,208
Now, if you just hand over
that Kinship Stone of yours.

72
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,125
What, mine?

73
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,375
Yes, indeed!

74
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,416
I've just gotta pop this
Mechinship Stone onto it

75
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,416
and then we'll be
all set to begin.

76
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,291
That white dragon will
be putty in your hands!

77
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:47,291
Well? Well? Well?

78
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,791
[chuckles]

79
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,708
Now, let's get these
forged together.

80
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,583
Aye-aye, sir, right away!

81
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,458
[DR. MANELGER] You seem
awfully tired there, my boy.

82
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,666
You should go on and get
yourself some rest, now.

83
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,166
It'll do you good.

84
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,208
[SIMONE] The mural of
Redan tells us that there are

85
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:11,458
a total of seven Kinship Ore.

86
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,958
There are seven!

87
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,916
Now so far, we've
found six of them.

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,083
The Forbidden Land
in Hakum Village.

89
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,541
Albrachs Village.

90
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,083
The Dovan Volcano.

91
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,250
Naubaka Island.

92
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:29,500
The Purespring
in Hakum Village.

93
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,333
And the Forest of
Confusion makes six.

94
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:35,708
That means there's still
one Kinship Ore left.

95
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,250
Well, where do you
think it could be?

96
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,250
A place of legend, it seems.

97
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,958
Huh? What does that mean?

98
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:45,333
It's in the Ruins of Zalam,
located within Mount Celion.

99
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,958
The Ruins of Zalam?

100
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,291
Where is this Mount
Celion anyway?

101
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:53,416
Even a world-traveler like
Navirou's never heard of it!

102
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,625
[SIMONE]
Right here.

103
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:58,041
Whoa, that's even beyond
the Darj Snowfields!

104
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,833
After comparing
the mural of Redan

105
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,333
with some of our ancient maps,

106
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,791
I'm confident the location
of the seventh Kinship Ore

107
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,708
corresponds to the
Ruins of Zalam.

108
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,833
So that's where we'll
find the final Kinshp Ore.

109
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,958
But what kinda place is it?

110
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,083
What're we getting
ourselves into?

111
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:17,541
Well, the Ruins of Zalam
appear only in the literature.

112
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:21,000
No one alive today
has ever seen them.

113
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,791
After suffering some
sort of disaster,

114
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:27,250
it was sealed away behind
an impenetrable gate.

115
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:32,625
This is known as
the Gate of Zalam.

116
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,208
According to the texts,

117
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:38,541
the seal can only be broken by
"Redan, astride a dragon white."

118
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:42,041
Wait, does that mean we won't be
able to open the gate ourselves?

119
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,291
I'm not sure.

120
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,208
But if "Redan" here
simply refers

121
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:49,291
to a Rider with a Kinship Stone,
then it may still be possible.

122
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,833
There's only one way
for us to find out.

123
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,625
You should know, it definitely
won't be an easy trip.

124
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,541
There are a lot of very tough
monsters up on Mount Celion.

125
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,791
Most Hunters won't
go anywhere near it!

126
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,291
Would Fate tell Navirou
to venture off

127
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,083
to such a dangerous place?

128
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,666
There's no way!

129
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,166
If that were the case, Navirou
would have to defy Fate itself!

130
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,041
We can leave you here
if you don't wanna come.

[NAVIROU yelps]

132
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,708
No, no, if you're going,
then Navirou's going, too.

133
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,708
I've gotta go. This is
the last Kinship Ore.

134
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,458
And that Kirin...

00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,375
I bet it wants me to go.

136
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,208
Then we'd better start
gathering supplies.

low on donuts!

Why don't you let
somebody else handle that?

140

I'll arrange for some
Hunters to escort us.

141
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,166
We can use the help.

We'll set out as
soon as we're ready.

It's Dr. Manelger, ma'am.

However, we did find a map,

and there was an "X"
marking Mount Celion.

Actually, I haven't!

318
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,041
[NAVIROU]
What?! You haven't?

319
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,125
Mister!

320
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,000
I've got your back!

321
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,541
[LILIA]
Captain Simone!

322
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,333
It's in your hands now.

323
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,958
I believe fully in
the power of Kinship!

324
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,875
Only you Riders
can stop the Blight.

325
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:14,916
Good luck, Lilia.

326
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,041
Yes, ma'am!

327
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,750
[REVERTO]
Get outta here, Lute!

328
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,083
[LUTE]
Okay!

329
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,791
Bring it.

330
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,208
[LUTE]
So it's up there?

331
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,583
The Gate of Zalam's that way.

332
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:33,833
[roar]

333
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:37,000
Oh, man! Don't tell me
there's another monster!

334
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,250
Ah! Navirou's tingly!

335
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,125
Navirou felt like this
once before when... Uh?

336
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,083
It's a Zinogre!

337
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,041
Worse! A Stygian Zinogre!

338
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,000
And it looks like it's Blighted!

339
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,750
Uh-oh.

340
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,375
Ride On!

341
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,458
Rathalos!

342
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,583
Here comes its Dragon Tackle!

343
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,833
Great, what now?

344
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,375
[LUTE yells]

345
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,208
[LILIA]
Lute!

346
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,375
Don't worry, I got this one!

347
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,708
Ride On!

348
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,416
Great Poogie!

349
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,458
[POOGIE]
Poogie-poogie-poogie-poogie.

350
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,875
[DEBLI]
Uh. What?

351
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,958
[POOGIE]
Poogie!

352
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,416
Let's go!

353
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:58,083
Now! Sky-High Extreme!

354
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,541
You okay there, Ratha?
Got a little rough, huh?

355
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:21,916
[DR. MANELGER,
ITSY-BITS yelling]

356
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,083
Manelger!

357
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,916
[DR. MANELGER, ITSY-BITS]
Help! Help!

358
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,750
[NAVIROU] Guess the winds
are really bad up there.

359
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:32,291
[LILIA] They're heading right
for the Gate of Zalam!

360
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,958
[LUTE]
Then we'd better hurry!

361
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:43,416
Ha, a crash landing!
It serves 'em right!

362
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,416
But I don't see any sign
of Dr. Manelger.

363
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,791
[gasps]

364
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,458
[ITSY-BITS] So is this
the Gate of Zalam, sir?

365
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:54,083
Yes, and the final Kinship
Ore should be hiding

366
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,958
just beyond those
enormous doors.

367
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,541
[LUTE]
Wait!

368
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,416
It's no use, you
can't go any farther!

369
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,000
Aha! It's the
white dragon egg!

370
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,541
Give it back! There's no
point in you two having it!

371
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,125
What good's it to you?

372
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,875
[chuckles] You'll
see soon enough.

373
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:14,416
Ahem, that's your cue
to enter, my boy!

374
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,750
Oh, Cheval.

375
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,333
Cheval!

376
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,541
What are you going
to do with that egg?

377
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,041
I'm making it my Monstie.

378
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,875
And then I'll stop
the Black Blight.

379
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,708
I'm putting an end
to all of this!

380
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,958
But only Redan can make
a white dragon his Monstie!

381
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,666
That's what the legend says!

382
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:48,208
I'll prove to you all that my
way is ultimately the right way!

383
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,458
Whoa, hold on, is that...?

384
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:57,250
The fruit of my labor and
genius, a Mecha Kinship Stone!

385
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,250
Wait, a Mecha Kinship Stone?

386
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,250
Is that different from this
artificial Kinship Stone?

387
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,958
Well, either way,
it's still just a fake!

388
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,750
This is a Kinship Stone
above all others!

389
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,625
You just watch me, Lute.

390
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,333
As long as I have this
enhanced Kinship Stone...

391
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,291
Stop it, Cheval!
Manelger is just using you!

392
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,000
You have to realize that!

393
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,583
I will be the next Redan!

394
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,333
Look, the white dragon
is responding!

395
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,291
I am the one the white
dragon has chosen!

396
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,708
What's that?

397
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,333
Hey.

398
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,000
Do you think...?

399
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:17,875
[LILIA] This is the
dragon white of legend.

400
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,291
It's huge!

401
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:22,416
How's it this big when
it's only just hatched?

402
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,458
[DR. MANELGER laughing]

403
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,291
Redan is reborn!

404
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,791
At long last, Cheval
is become Redan!

405

[NAVIROU screaming]

408
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,916
Please, Cheval, no!

409
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,041
I'm going!

00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,208

Hey! Don't leave us here!

413
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:24,791
I said, "Don't leave us!"

414
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,208
I'm coming, Cheval.

415

[NAVIROU]
<i>Monstie Manual</i> !

416
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,458
Here comes the part
where Navirou

417
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,000
tells you about Monsties.

418
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:41,958
All right, Navirou
hopes you have

419
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,208
your Media Trigger
Smart Phone app open.

420
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,625
Better get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

421
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:51,833
And now, it's time to form
a Kinship with our Monsties!

[NAVIROU] Our Monstie this
time is: Versa Pietru!

The monster from the legend
of Redan has finally arrived,

426
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,541
and who knew it would
awaken looking like that?

Hey, Lute, you're really gonna
have to stop Cheval now!

Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!
