1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,541
[NARRATOR]
These youngsters are Riders,

2
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:12,083
on a quest to track down
blackened Kinship Ore

3
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:17,291
and stop the Black Blight that's
been spreading across the world.

4
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:20,333
On his first visit home
to Hakum Village in ages,

5
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:23,166
Lute unexpectedly
reunited with Cheval.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,916
Your self-centeredness...
and your sheer arrogance...

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,791
That is what killed my mother.

8
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:36,166
[NARRATOR] The time has come
for Lute to face his past.

9
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,000
[horn blaring]

10
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,458
[VILLAGER A]
A monster's coming!

11
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,375
[VILLAGER B]
Everyone, get to the shrine!

12
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:44,916
[LUTE'S FATHER]
Please, take this, Chief.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,041
If worse comes to worst and...

14
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:50,708
...I fall, I want you to
give it to my young son,

15
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,666
once he's ready for it.

16
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,875
[sighs]

17
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,541
[CHIEF OMNA]
It seems the time has come.

18
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,166
[NAVIROU] Navirou will
make you feel better!

19
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,791
C'mon, stay positive!

20
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:12,041
That's what you'd say if
Navirou was in your shoes!

21
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,875
[LUTE]
I just...

22
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:18,041
All this time, I believed
in the power of Kinship.

23
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,041
But now... What do I do now?

24
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,083
[CHIEF OMNA]
Lute, to answer that question,

25
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,875
you must journey to...

26
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,833
...the Tower of Illusion.

27
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,958
The Tower of Illusion?

28
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,041
[CHIEF OMNA]
The Tower is a place of legend.

29
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:37,041
A place that bestows great
wisdom upon only those

30
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:40,583
who can pass its trials
of mind and spirit.

31
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,333
And although you
will suffer greatly

32
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,291
throughout your time there,

33
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,291
I promise that if you
endure this trial,

34
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,750
you will find what you seek.

35
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,875
Find what I seek?

36
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,666
All right. Let's go.

37
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,041
I'll do the Tower's trial.

38
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,750
Whatever it takes to discover
the power of Kinship,

39
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,250
I'll do it.

40
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,833
Of course.

41
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,833
Where's the Tower
of Illusion, Chief?

42
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,750
It's ocean as far as I can see.

43
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,333
We're almost there.

44
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,041
We should set up camp
here for the night.

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,625
[NAVIROU whimpering]

46
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,458
It feels like something's
watching us.

47
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,375
[LUTE]
What kinda something?

48
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,458
An unspeakably evil
being of cosmic horror!

49
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,625
Giant! And hungry!

50
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,958

Oh, no.

55
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,000
Ah!

56
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,958
Lute, it's here, run!

57
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,333
[gasps]

58
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,500
[AVINIA] After all that,
he treats me like a monster?

59
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,125
[LUTE]
Avinia?

60
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,916
[AVINIA] You're the one who
asked me to come, Navirou.

61
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,333
[AVINIA] I was still on Naubaka
Island when I got his letter.

62
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,958
Navirou told me he was
beside himself with worry.

63
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:23,875
When I read that, I knew things
were bad, so I came right away.

64
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,541
Is that really true?

65
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,333
Navirou was not
"beside himself"!

66
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,083
No? That's what you wrote.

67
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,250
[NAVIROU]
Hey! You don't have to show him!

68
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,458
[LUTE chuckles]

69
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:42,458
Navirou, thank you.
And you, too.

70
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,000
What are you talking about?

71
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,625
Helping those in trouble
is what friends do.

72
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:52,083
You should know, you're the
one who taught me that, Lute.

73
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,666
Avinia.

74
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,875
Thank you.

75
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,625
[NAVIROU]
Hm-hm.

76
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,416
It's time, Lute.

77
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,541
[LUTE]
Chief Omna?

78
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:18,041
The way to the Tower
of Illusion is now open.

79
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,291
[gasps]

80
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,083
[LUTE]
I still don't see it.

81
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,666
[CHIEF OMNA]
Just wait.

82
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,750
[CHIEF OMNA]
Behold. The Tower of Illusion.

83
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,833
Help him. Please
guide Lute on his way.

84
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,208
Here we go.

85
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,166
Whoa, it's pitch black!

86
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,041
[NAVIROU squeals]

87
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:18,166
Man. It's creepier in the light!

88
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,333
They say that any person
with doubt in his heart

89
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,000
who overcomes the
Tower of Illusion

90
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,833
will then be led to the truth.

91
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,333
You know a lot about
the Tower, huh?

92
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,875
Yes.

93
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,583
Because I've been here once
before to solve my own problem.

94
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,416
[LUTE]
What?

95
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,416
[AVINIA] When the Black Blight
attacked my hometown,

96
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,541
I lost everything
I ever had or loved.

97
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,500
I was all alone.

98
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,166
The only thing I
felt was despair.

99
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,375
At that point, I decided
I'd be better off

100
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,083
if the Blight had taken me, too.

101
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:51,291
But in the Tower, I learned
I wasn't really alone.

102
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,375
I still had Frostfang
walking by my side.

103
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:58,000
All that heartache, and hope
was right there in front of me.

104
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,708
If I hadn't subjected myself
to the Tower of Illusion,

105
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,458
I never would've
overcome my despair

106
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,375
and remembered what's
truly important in life.

107
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,166
[LUTE]
Aw, it's a dead end.

108
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,791
Let's--

[yelps]

111
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,250
Where did this come from?

112
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,666
This Tower's so weird.

113
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,833
What's going on here?

114
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,291
What? Hakum Village?

115
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,208
[horn blaring]

116
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,875
Yo! Listen up, Nargacuga!
Guess what...

117
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,458
Navirou, what're you doing?

118
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,708
[gasps]

119
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,583
Wait, what'm I doing?

120
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,625
I was in the Tower
of Illusion, but now...

121
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,375
Hey, that's enough, Lute!

122
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,333
This is no time to be spouting
off random nonsense!

123
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,958
Go stop that Nargacuga

124
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:27,416
so we can get some of Mrs.
Vlau's soup before it runs out!

Now to signal Cheval!

Is this--? This isn't possible!

134
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,708
[LUTE] How did I end up
back at Hakum Village

at this exact moment?

That doesn't make any sense!

about this for so long.

One chance. One chance to
do this day over again.

00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,458
I could've saved Mrs. Vlau.

324
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,541
But I was wrong.

325
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm not strong.

326
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,791
That's why I need to
fight alongside friends.

327
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,791
I can't go alone, but
if we all join together,

328
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,291
we can protect what we love.

329
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,125
That's Kinship.

330
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,541
And I believe in its power
more than anything!

331
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,791
That's the spirit, buddy!

Whoa!

334
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:47,500
It'll be high tide,
soon. Better move.

335
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,458
Hey, Chief. I dug out that
special somethin' you wanted.

336
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,583
Great. That's
perfect timing, Dan.

337
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,791
So, how was the
Tower of Illusion?

338
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,791
From the look on your face,
I assume it went well.

339
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,291
This is for you.

340
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,625
Just before his passing,

341
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,458
your father asked
that I watch over this

342
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:09,291
and give it to you
only when your skills

343
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:12,000
had reached the
appropriate level.

344
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,833
From my dad?

[CHIEF OMNA]
Impressive, isn't it?

346
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,750
This is the suit of armor
your father wore

347
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:20,041
when he was about your age.

Cheval, the Kinship we share,

Here comes the part
where Navirou

352
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,000
tells you about Monsties.

353
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,000
All right, Navirou
hopes you have

354
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,208
your Media Trigger
Smart Phone app open.

355
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,625
Better get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

356
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:51,833
And now, it's time to form
a Kinship with our Monsties!

[NAVIROU] Our Monstie
this time is: Barioth!

360
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,333
Avinia's ice cold
monster sends a chill

361
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,666
down enemy spines with its
huge, amber-colored tusks.

362
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,125
Barioth can even run
super-fast on the ice

363
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:12,208
by gripping it with the
spikes on its wings.

364
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,916
Talk about cool!

365
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,416
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!

monster in the Babda Rainforest!

won't work?
