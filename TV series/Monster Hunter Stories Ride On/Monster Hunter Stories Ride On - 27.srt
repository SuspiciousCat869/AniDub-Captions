[NARRATOR]
This boy's name is Lute,

2
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:17,208
a young Rider who forms
Kinship with monsters.

3
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:19,125
He's faced off against
many monsters

4
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:22,541
infected with the Black Blight.

5
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:25,208
Lute believes the Blight is
connected to Kinship Ore

6
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,750
that have become
corrupted and blackened.

7
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:30,083
Now he's on his way
to the Dovan Volcano,

8
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:34,833
to purify the Kinship Ore there
and help stop the Blight.

9
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,500
The Dovan Volcano!

[NAVIROU groaning]

11
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:41,416
[NAVIROU]
Uh?

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,875
Oh, this headache
is killing Navirou!

13
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:47,250
What? Are you all outta donuts?

14
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,166
[NARRATOR] What unseen
force could be behind

15
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,708
Navirou's sudden headaches?

16
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:55,208
A monster? The Blight?
The adventure continues now!

17
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:02,083
[BOY A gasping]

18
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,041
Everyone's looking at Navirou!

19
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:07,500
Seems wherever Navirou travels,
he's always Mr. Popular!

20
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,833
[NAVIROU laughs]

21
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,958
I guess you've recovered
from that awful headache?

22
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,916

[gasps] Oh, no!

00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,375
Get lost!

[HUNTERS shouting]

28
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,000
We've got him!

29
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,333
Surround them!

30
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,375
[LUTE]
Uh-oh.

31
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,375
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

32
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,125
[HUNTER C]
Are you a Rider as well?

33
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,083
What? "As well"?

34
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,166
How do you explain
that Rathalos?

35
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,958
Uh, what do you mean?

36
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,291
[DMIR]
That's enough!

37
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,416
Wait! This one's different!

38
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,458
Just calm down!
Lower that thing!

39
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,875
[HUNTER C]
Dmir?

40
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,416
[BOTH]
Uh?

41
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,833
We really appreciate you
sticking up for us, sir.

42
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:09,041
[DMIR] No, no. If anything,
I should thank you.

43
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,875
After all, you saved
that boy. Am I right?

44
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:13,958
[LUTE, NAVIROU]
Yeah!

45
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,708
That was a close one.
Thanks again.

46
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,583
Oh, no need to thank us,

47
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,250
but if you happen to
have some donuts,

48
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,625
we'll gladly take
them off your hands.

49
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:22,875
Oh, jeez.

50
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,333
[laughs]

51
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:27,083
You guys are total opposites
of the other Rider I met.

52
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:27,791
[LUTE]
Hm?

53
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,833
You know another Rider?

54
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:33,041
Yeah. Met him just
recently, in fact.

55
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,708
He was a rather cold young man,

56
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,500
obsessed with defeating
monster after monster.

57
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,875
What?

58
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,375
All my life, I've heard
stories about Riders

59
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,333
who can control monsters.

60
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,416
But now they also slay them?

61
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,916
That crazy Rider made my buddies
at the mine real nervous.

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,458
Strange days, huh?

63
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,916
[stomach growls]

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,041
Could your stomach
growl any louder, Lute?

65
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,583
Aw, c'mon!

66
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,208
You're both welcome to stay
here for the night if you like.

67
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,875
Wow, thanks, Mister!

68
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,875
I've got my own boy who's
right around your age.

69
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,791
Lately, I've been working
as a miner, though,

70
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,375
so we've had to live apart.

71
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,833
But one thing that connects
us is a love of donuts.

72
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,833
So while I can't offer luxury,

73
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,875
you're welcome to eat your
fill of my donut stash!

74
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,666
--Awesome!
--Donuts!

75
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,125
We won't be back here
for a while, team.

76
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,833
So don't be stingy when
it comes to your packing.

77
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,291
Captain Simone.

78
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,833
Yes, what is it?

79
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,833
I'm sorry, but may I please
have your permission

80
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,666
to return to Hakum Village?

81
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,500
And why's that?

82
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,333
Because if history's
any indication,

83
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,291
I bet Chief Omna knows where
we can find the White Dragon.

84
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,875
Yes, perhaps.

85
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,541
But, Lilia.

86
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,541
It sounds like you're leaving an
official White Dragon expedition

87
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,625
to just go off on your own.

88
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,041
Captain Simone didn't bring
you aboard to work alone,

89
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,958
but to be on this special team.

90
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,333
That's not it at all.

91
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,750
I'm trying to help the team
the best way I know how!

92
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:57,875
Can't you see that?

93
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,416
I suppose so.
What do you think?

94
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,541
I don't see why not.

95
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,458
I'm sure Chief Omna
will be more than happy

96
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,916
to answer any
question Lilia has.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,500
And he's the right man to ask.

98
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:12,541
He's got more knowledge in his
head than any book in this room.

99
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,250
Thank you, Captain Simone!

100
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,541
[LUTE, NAVIROU sigh]

101
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,791
[DMIR]
How's the bath?

102
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,875
[BOTH]
It's perfect.

103
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,666
Go on, eat as much you like.

104
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,625
Yes, sir!

105
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,208
So good!

106
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,333
That's great.

107
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:31,666
Well, I'm off to
take my bath now.

108
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,000
Just think, tomorrow we'll
be at the Dovan Volcano!

109
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:34,958
[NAVIROU screams]

110
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,583
The headaches are back!

111
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,458
Again? What's causing them?

112
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,666
Navirou wishes he knew.

113
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,208
But if anybody
should be suffering

114
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,083
from a headache right
now, it should be you!

115
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,458
What?

116
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,833
That Rider he talked about.
It was obviously Cheval!

117
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,875
Yeah. I know it was.

118
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,500
It's like... It's
like he's become

119
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:57,208
a totally different person now.

120
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,916
[sighs]

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,125
[NAVIROU]
There, there.

122
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,416
Don't worry, buddy.
Still got your memories.

123
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,750
You two will always be
joined by Kinship.

124
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,166
What?

125
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,708
The memories of the old
Cheval will always be in here.

126
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,541
Or is it here? Yeah.

127
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:15,541
Okay.

128
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,583
[chuckles]

129
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:21,625
Meanwhile, Navirou doesn't have
the foggiest memory of his past.

130
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,208
[LUTE]
Huh?

131
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,250
But that never stopped Navirou
from being handsome and amazing.

132
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,625
Navirou doesn't
need silly memories.

133
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:32,208
Navirou only needs donuts
to survive in this world.

134
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,416
And you know,
sometimes you're around.

135
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,875
If anything, I always figured

136
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,041
you were just a little
absent-minded.

137
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:44,666
What?! How did you eat all
of the donuts already? When?

138
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,083
[NAVIROU]
Hm. Can't remember. Sorry!

139
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,791
[LUTE]
How convenient.

140
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:56,000
So, boys, where you
headed off to today?

141
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,291
The Dovan Volcano.

142
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,458
[NAVIROU screams]

143
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,125
Would you please stop
saying that name?!

144
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,833
Hold on, Dovan Volcano?

145
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,625
Yeah. There's something there
we need to investigate.

146
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,291
Well, make sure that
you're careful out there.

147
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,416
I've heard rumors of monsters
roaming that whole area.

148
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,541
[LUTE]
Huh?

149
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,208
That's why we miners
don't go near it.

150
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,208
[DMIR sighs]

151
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,666
Makes it hard to
get our work done.

152
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,666
Anyway, you're goin' no
matter what I say, right?

153
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,791
I might as well take you
to get supplies first.

154
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,666
That's great! Thank you, sir!

155
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:30,125
Let's see. Got this,
this, this, and that.

156
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,541
Well, we're all set!

157
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,500
Plenty of donuts, obviously.

158
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,166
Next stop: The Dovan Volcano!

159
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,208
[NAVIROU screams]

160
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,791
So every time you
hear that name,

161
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,708
you get a big piercing headache?

162
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,041
But why?

163
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,583
Uh? What gives?

164
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,291
Well, I obviously can't leave
this precious cargo with you

165
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,916
if you're going to keep
freaking out like that.

166
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,458
There's got to be a
reason why Navirou

167
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,708
keeps getting those headaches!

168
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,291
Probably.

169
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,166
[LUTE]
Hm.

170
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,791
Hyoro? A Kinship Stone!

171
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,375
Wait, what? Hey!

172
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,750
[LUTE]
Hyoro!

173
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,666
Uh. Oh, I-- you look just
like someone else I know.

174
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,541
I'm sorry.

175
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,375
Yeah, she does.

176
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,333
Please excuse me.

177
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,416
Oh, it's fine.

178
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,666
Wait, why do you
have a Kinship Stone?

179
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,000
What? The bracelet?

180
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,916
I bought it from a weird
little stand outside of town.

181
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,250
[DEBLI] No pushing,
folks, we got plenty!

[NAVIROU screams]

192
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,416
[LUTE] How can you call it
a "Real Live Rider Shop"

193
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,458
when you're selling fakes?

194
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,250
These Stones are not fake!

195
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,083
They're "artificially
created replicas."

196
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,666
And you'll be impressed
to hear they work

almost as well
as the real thing.

198

Uh, better than the real thing.

Awesome, huh?

200
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,541
How's that even possible?

00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah! Where'd ya get
these, Debli? Fess up!

202
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:15,666
What? What makes you think
I'd give away that secret?

203
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:20,041
Ah! Okay, I'll tell you.

204
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,333
At the Dovan Volca--

206
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,625
What the heck is
wrong with him?

207
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,833
Oh, he's been getting these
weird headaches, lately.

208
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,375
Don't worry about it.

209
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,916
Now then, as I've said,
the Stones aren't fake,

210
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,291
they're artificially created.

211
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,833
And I'm afraid I can't tell
you any more than that.

Trade secrets and whatnot.

Now, watch how
powerful they are.

So adorable.

Hey, you!

00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,375
I rescued you with
my own two hands!

How could you
forget that, Poogie?

00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,208
I can't believe you're
giving me attitude!

00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,583
C'mon! Ride On!

Wait for your Rider!

227
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,625
Poogie does not like Debli.

228
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,416

Let me on, Poogie!

231
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,291
Debli, the reason
we're able to Ride On

232
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,791
is because we get Kinship
with our Monsties.

233
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,458
Just because you have a Stone
doesn't mean you have Kinship.

234
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,375
You think you're
so good, don'tcha?

00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,708
You need to master Riding,

246
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,916
and no one's a better
teacher on any subject

247
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,208
than the great Navirou!

00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,375
He'll call you
"Pupil Number Two"!

Okay! Hey! Wait, I don't
wanna be "number two"!

As for you, young Lute.

I'm afraid your friend
and hero Navirou

252
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,166
can't travel with
you any further.

ride it, not you!

Help! Pig thief! Help!

259
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,083
Jeez, I guess Navirou
really doesn't wanna go.

260
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,250

Hey! Wait up! Come
back here, you jerk!

Now gimme back my Monstie!

Call me, "Master Navirou,"

Enough of this!

idea for you to run away

from your friend like that?

I mean, Cheval's already
left. And the others.

268
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,625
If you ditch him, too,
he's gonna be all alone.

269
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,166
Take it from me:

It's not easy to make it
on your own in this world!

where you reason with Navirou?

Sorry it's not a donut.

283

Navirou accepts.

284
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:29,125
Most people don't know, but
my dad's actually a Hunter.

285
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,083
What? You serious?

286
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,083
Uh-huh.

287
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,666
I couldn't follow
in his footsteps

288
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,875
because this black
haze rolled in.

289
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,791
Drove away all the
monsters near us

290
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,333
and my dad couldn't
hunt any more.

291
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:45,583
Ever since then, I've been
on my own, hustlin' for Zenny.

Man, when I first
laid eyes on Rathalos,

293
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,041
I thought he looked so awesome.

294
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:55,416
A Rider! No way any black
haze would stop them!

295
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,291
So that's why you're
struggling to become a Rider.

00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,875
Wrong! I'm not struggling.

297

the last thing I do!

about going back to Lute?

gone their separate ways.

323
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,625
Yes, but I still
believe in the Kinship

324
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,125
that was between them.

325
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,458
And while they may be apart now,

326
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,958
they are working
towards the same goal:

327
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,500
Stopping the Black Blight
and saving the world.

328
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,625
Ah, that's good to hear.

329
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,625
I doubt a Kinship
as strong as theirs

330
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,791
would end over a disagreement

331
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:31,458
What else, my dear? Have you
come to ask something?

332
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,333
It's about a rare monster.

333
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:37,500
The Scriveners are investigating
on behalf of the Guild Master.

334
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,958
It's a legendary monster
called "the dragon white."

335
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,833
The dragon white...

I was really "Riding On"!
Now I'm a Rider just like you.

Here it is.

Hm?

That's funny. Navirou feels
like he's been here.

couldn't remember your past.

Navirou? Are you okay?

00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,583
Maybe we should go in without
you while you rest up.

anywhere, Lute.

I swear, this rock wall
wasn't here last time.

Which is bad 'cause I don't
know another path in here.

[ITSY-BITS laughs]

383
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,000
Welcome, Mr. Rider!

384

Dr. Manelger and Itsy-Bits!

385

Hey! I know them!

386
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,375
Those guys are the ones who
dropped the Stones I picked up.

387
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,458
So you two are still at it?

388
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,500
Why're you mechanizing
more monsters?

389
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,166
And what are you
doing in this cave?

390
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,000
We could ask you the same thing.

391
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,791
Why are you three sneaking
around in our cave?

392
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,458
We came to check on
the Kinship Ore here.

393
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,541
Inspecting the Ore, you say?

394
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:25,958
And why might that be?

395
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,000
Because if it's been infected
with the Black Blight,

396
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,625
then we need to purify it!

how foolish he is.

and more efficient ways

to possess dominion
over monsters

404
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,791
than by cleaning up
dirty Kinship Ore.

of our monster trap

is a monster Rider!

Hey! What's goin' on in here?

438
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,708
What is this, your secret base?

439
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,083
I'll explain.

440
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,541
Itsy-Bits and I had been
searching for Kinship Stones

441
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,041
to control monsters.

442
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,666
Unfortunately,
we couldn't find any.

443
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,916
Then--

444
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,500
We were able to find out
where they come from,

445
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,541
and that's the Kinship Ore!

446
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,500
Using our superior brains,
we then analyzed its structure

447
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,625
and successfully created
artificial Kinship Stones.

448
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,375
Itsy-Bits, that's
supposed to be my line!

449
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,875
Sorry, Doctor!

450
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,500
With the artificial Stones,

451
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,291
not only can we
improve the monsters,

452
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,416
we can fully control
them as well.

453
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,625
In other words--

454
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,708
Riders like you are
no longer the only ones

455
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,333
who can control monsters!

456
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,541
Argh, I was supposed
to tell him that!

457
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,166
I'm sorry, Doctor!

458
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,583
You're crazy!

459
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:15,041
Riders don't use Kinship
Stones to control monsters!

460
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,291
We use them to form Kinship!

461
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,958
Kinship? What nonsense!

462
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:23,208
That ancient notion has zero
relevance in our modern life.

is guaranteed--

from that dreary cage.
