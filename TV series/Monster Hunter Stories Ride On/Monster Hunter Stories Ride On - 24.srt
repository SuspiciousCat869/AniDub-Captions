And it is infected
with the Black Blight!

00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,541
[NARRATOR]
These young folks are Riders

who form Kinship with monsters.

7
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:31,333
They fought as hard as they
could to stop a Blighted monster

who's running amok
in the desert.

All right!

00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,000
[NARRATOR]
But the Blighted Diablos

11
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,791
attacked the young Riders
without mercy.

It's my leg.

[NARRATOR] And despite all

What do you mean?

We've been worried sick
about you, that's what.

Well, yeah, you were

all through the night.

Really, I was?

00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,333
Does your leg still hurt?

00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm okay.

00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,375
I was having a bad dream.

00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,375
The Blighted Diablos
attacked me and then...

You'll be fine, Lilia!

Don't worry,
we'll keep you safe!

No, Lute.
It's not as simple as that.

00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,958
[LUTE] Yeah, it is! With all
our Kinship power combined,

00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,083
I know we can do it!

Thanks, Navi, that's sweet!

And I'm sorry if
I had you guys worried.

I'm feeling much better now.

That's great.

53
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,083
It doesn't change the fact
that that Blighted Diablos

going to become a Rider?

you want some spending money!

[CHEVAL] Going to the
festival's not in our plans.

We have to get back
there to defeat that Diablos.

until your leg's healed.

are gonna need to

going back to the desert.

But Lilia's better now, right?

So, we should be gearing up
and heading back to the desert.

[MILLE]
For what it's worth,

I don't think
you're wrong, Cheval.

Me, either.

143
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,541
[DEBLI]
Funny, I heard that Riders

144
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,375
were bound together
with deep Kinship,

145
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,000
but it looks like that
doesn't apply to you guys.

146

So are you sure
you're okay with that?

147
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,375
I mean, us Hunters prefer
to take on monsters as a team,

148
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,583
but whatever works for you.

149

[DAN]
I see.

150
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,583
So Cheval was extra eager
to return to the desert. huh?

151
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,666
Yeah, and then
he just took off.

152
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,416
That Blighted Diablos
is nothing to be trifled with.

153
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,083
This is when we Riders need
to stick together the most.

154
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,625
That's right.

155

If only I had been stronger,

I coulda saved Mrs. Vlau.

And Ratha.

If only I had been better
at Riding On, then maybe...
