1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,416
[NARRATOR] This is Lute,
a young Rider on a Wuest

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,333
to track down blackened
Kinship Ore

3
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:17,000
and stop the Black Blight that's
been spreading across the world.

4
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:20,083
Lute's Monstie, Ratha, has
become stricken with the Blight,

5
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:22,708
just as Cheval and
his team have returned.

6
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:25,958
Your Rathalos has been
afflicted with the Blight.

7
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,750
It must be destroyed!

8
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:31,666
Cheval, I swear,
I won't give up on you!

9
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,583
Because our Kinship
can never be broken!

10
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,750
[NARRATOR] After a sad parting,
Lute resolved that one day soon,

11
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:42,250
he and Cheval would come to
a peaceful understanding.

12
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,375
Determined, Lute's attention
turned to another friend,

13
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:46,958
Reverto!

14
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,583
[REVERTO]
We're goin' on a Quest, kid.

15
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,041
Huh? A Quest?

16
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:54,583
Like now? Right now?
Stat?  A.S.A.P?

17
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:58,166
It involves one of that mad
scientist's mecha-monsters.

18
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:02,791
[LUTE] What? One of
Manelger's monsters escaped?

19
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,375
The rumors I heard are
it's made a den for itself

20
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,958
in one of your mines.

21
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:10,375
That would certainly explain all
the attacks on me and my men.

22
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,750
It's real bad.

23
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,541
We can't do any repair work
on the collapsed shaft.

24
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,125
We need someone
to slay that beast.

25
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,125
[REVERTO]
Aren't there other Hunters

26
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,041
you've worked with in town?

27
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,541
Why me?

28
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,000
'Cause you're the best.

29
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,541
We need a man who can
do this job right.

30
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,875
[REVERTO]
I see.

31
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:30,541
Your reputation precedes
you, Mr. Lone Wolf Hunter.

32
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,166
Please, help us, sir!

33
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,041
Well, I'll help him. I can stop
it and keep you safe, Mister!

34
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,875
You like to talk a
big game, don'tcha?

35
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,041
[chuckles]

36
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,208
I don't know 'bout that.

37
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,416
I hear it's quite the maze of
shafts and tunnels down there.

38
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,416
We need someone who knows
the terrain to guide us.

39
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,916
I'm afraid that's impossible.

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,458
Well, if you're worried about--

41
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,541
Don't you look
down on us miners!

42
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,958
We ain't afraid of any monster.

43
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,250
It's just, lately, this mine,

44
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,875
well, strange things
happen in it.

45
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,583
Strange, how?

46
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,291
Something's down there.

47
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,708
You mean other than the monster?

48
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,583
I'm talking about a ghost.

49
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:13,500
[REVERTO]
Huh?

50
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:14,333
[BOTH gasp]

51
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,250
A g-g-g-ghost?

52
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,416
[MINER A]
Every time we go in, we hear it.

53
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,000
A little girl's voice crying
out from deep within the shaft.

54
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,958
And we're not the only
ones hearing it, either.

55
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,375
That sound! Thinkin' about
it gives me chills!

56
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,791
[MINER A] If it was just a
monster, I'd guide you, easy.

57
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,291
But a ghost? No way.

58
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,333
I see.

59
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,666
So that's why.

60
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,208
Dmir couldn't find another
Hunter to take the job.

61
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,458
Unlike you city boys,

62
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,125
mountain folk are
far more believing

63
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,083
when it comes to
things like ghosts.

64
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,125
People 'round here've
already started callin' it

65
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,250
"the Cursed Mine."

66
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,583
They won't go one step inside.

67
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,458
Just my luck.

68
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,875
We'll be fine.

69
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,625
After all, we still have a map
of the mine from Dmir.

70
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,000
C'mon, Mister!

71
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,416
[NAVIROU]
No way!

72
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,375
Navirou won't go in that mine
for a thousand donuts!

73
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,708
Ugh. Here we go.

74
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,208
You really think that old-timey
costume will protect you?

75
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,666
You know, you didn't
have to come.

76
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,041
We'd be fine without you.

77
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,416
[NAVIROU]
Ghosts are scary!

78
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,458
And whether Navirou's
up there or down here,

79
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,791
he sure-as-heck won't be caught
alone when one shows up!

80
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,416
They're not real.

81
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,583
But if they were, think
of how exciting it'd be

82
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,083
to meet and talk to one!

83
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,041
No thank you!

84
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,416
[REVERTO]
Dead end, huh?

85
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,583
This map's not gonna
be of much use.

86
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,000
[clanking]

87
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,375
What was that?

88
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,833
The g-g-g-ghost!

89
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:52,208
Be gone, ghost! Be gone!
Evil spirits, stay back!

90
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,750
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna work.

91
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:59,833
But if something is in there,
it might be our monster.

[DEBLI]
Well, well, well.

97
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,666
Sounds like you need an expert

98
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,875
to guide you through
these tunnels.

99
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,583
I'm happy to help you boys

'long as I get a little
somethin' out of it.

Let's not talk pay just yet.

00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,375
Can you really guide us?

103
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,250
I used to sneak
into Manelger's lab

104
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,541
and nick all kinds of stuff.

105
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,750
I mean, this cave's pretty
much my back yard now.

106
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,500
I don't think you
should brag about that.

107
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,416
Wait a minute, what are you
stealing this time, Debli?

108
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,583
I've been waitin'
for you to ask!

109
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,166
Because of the ghost rumors,
no mining is going on.

110
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,666
No mining means no ore.

111
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,708
And a shortage means the price
of ore is now on the rise!

112
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,458
Of course. It's
always about money.

113
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,583
Huh. I find those who mock
money are always the ones

114
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,750
who don't have any.

115
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,958
All right, calm down.

us around, okay?

to cut right to the chase.

If we can control monsters,

we can use them to
hunt the bad ones,

We could create
a peaceful world.

was just a Felyne

00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,208
You'll never protect anyone
if you think like that.

323
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,625
[NAVIROU] C'mon, what
are you waiting for?

324
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,291
[LUTE, NAVIROU scream]

325
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,666
[CHEVAL]
These tragedies happen

326
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,541
because Lute puts
monsters ahead of people.

327
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,583
[NAVIROU]
Get up, Lute! Snap out of it!

328
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,458
You can't keep Reverto safe

329
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,958
if you're just lying
on the ground!

330
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,666
Yeah, Lute!

331
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,000
You're right.

332
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,458
I'll keep him safe!

333
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,375
[roars]

334
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,625
[LUTE yelling]

335
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:25,000
Oh, wow. Look at them move.

336
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,541
Crossblaze, attack!

337
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,458
Did I do the right thing?

338
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,583
[REVERTO] I'm sorry you
had to do that, Lute.

339
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,500
But your choice ended
up saving my life.

340
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,125
I owe ya big time for this one.

341
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,875
[LUTE]
Did I really save you, though?

342
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,166
I still can't get over that
you kids tame monsters

343
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,333
and then Ride them!

344
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:30,000
You're right. Kinship Stones
are wondrous things, indeed.

345
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,875
The Kinship between
Rider and Monstie

346
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,250
is the key to everything.

347
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:37,625
In fact, you only become a Rider
when your hearts are one.

348
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,750
In other words, the two
are one and the same!

349
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,291
They're "one and the same," huh?

350
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,125
That is what you
looked like out there.

351
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,125
You know, that reminds me

352
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,583
of what my Hunting
teacher once said.

353
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:54,000
The key is to "be the
forest, be the beast."

354
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:57,083
And what does "be the
forest, be the beast" mean?

355
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,166
Yeah, explain!

356
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,250
This was back in my rookie days.

357
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,916
I didn't know what
it meant, either.

358
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,625
[REVERTO] But all that
changed when I took on

359
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,875
my first real monster.

360
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,500
There I was, hacking
and slashing away,

361
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,916
when before I knew it, I was
the one who was on the ground.

362
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:24,166
[REVERTO] I thought I'd lost.
I was sure my time was up.

363
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,208
[REVERTO] After laying there
for what must've been hours,

364
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,333
I started hearing things.

365
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:36,625
First, the whistle of the wind.
Then, the roar of the water.

366
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,916
Turns out, the wind
was my breath.

367
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,083
The water, my blood flowing.

368
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,791
I was alive.

369
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,000
When I finally sat up,

370
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:48,416
I saw the defeated beast
sprawled beside me.

371
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,250
I was confused.

372
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:53,458
Was I the monster,
or was the monster me?

373
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,125
[REVERTO]
That's how much I'd become one

374
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,500
with the monster's movements.

375
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:03,166
In that moment, I realized
I was part of nature.

376
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,916
A part of the forest.

377
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,500
Just one more beast.
No different than the monster.

378
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:12,083
I'd finally come to understand
my teacher's words.

379
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,000
"Be the forest, be the beast."

380
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,125
Neither monster, nor Hunter.

381
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,916
We're forest and
beast, one being.

382
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,250
Like Riders, it's
a kind of Kinship.

383
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,958
Opposites in total harmony.

384
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,541
Our livelihoods
are only possible

385
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,208
with the monsters' blessing.

386
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:34,166
So that's the story behind
"be the forest, be the beast."

387
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,458
Hunters and Riders
become one with monsters.

388
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:41,625
Do you see how
alike we truly are?

389
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:45,458
I always thought... Hunters
and Riders were different.

390
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:49,458
But, yeah, it's more like we're
two sides of the same coin!

391
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,000
That's why you shouldn't
hide who you are.

392
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,750
Show people what a Rider is,

393
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:57,166
what it means when you share
Kinship with a monster.

394
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,833
Looks like my little
pep talk worked.

395
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:08,208
Mister, there's only one
thing I know for sure.

396
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:11,708
Riders can't be bending
monsters to their will.

397
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,708
Monster and Rider
are both equal.

398
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,500
That's why they're
able to form Kinship

399
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,000
and make two hearts into one.

400
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,416
That's what you mean by
"one and the same."

401
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,750
[LUTE]
Yeah.

402
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:26,166
I wish... Cheval
will get it, too.

403
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,291
I won't give up on him!

404
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,625
I'll see you all back
in Gildegaran, right?

405
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:36,958
Right!

406
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,583
So, Pansy, now
that you're free,

407
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,041
are you going back
to Koapni Village?

408
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,083
[PANSY]
Mh-hm.

409
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,333
Navirou, can mew come back, too?

410
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,166
[NAVIROU gasps]

411
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,625
Um, that's rather sudden.

412
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,666
Um, Navirou's not sure he's
mentally prepared for that!

413
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,416
But, Navirou, I'm pawsitive

414
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,458
that meeting mew here like
this must be our destiny!

415
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:04,083
Oh, Pansy. You're so forward.

416
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,666
Look, you're a nice girl, but--

417
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,208
[PANSY] You see, Koapni
Village is in a lot of trouble.

418
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:12,208
I need mew to come back
with me to help save it!

419
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,458
What?

420
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,416
[PANSY]
A monster attacked.

421
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,208
One that's all dark
and hazy and sick.

422
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:20,916
[BOTH gasp]

423
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,666
Sounds like--

The Black Blight!

425
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:27,958
Navirou. We're going.

426
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,208
Right!

[NAVIROU]
<i>Monstie Manual</i> !

428
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,583
Here comes the part
where Navirou

429
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,125
tells you about Monsties.

430
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:42,083
All right, Navirou
hopes you have

431
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,333
your Media Trigger
Smart Phone app open.

432
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:46,750
Better get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

433
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:51,916
And now, it's time to form
a Kinship with our Monsties!

434
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
The moment of new life!

Awaken!

436
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:02,541
[NAVIROU] Our Monstie
this time is: Glavenus!

437
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,416
Awesome tail, right?

438
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,791
It's like a Hunter's
Great Sword.

439
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:09,791
And because it's iron-rich,
it can spark fires!

440
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:13,916
It's definitely set
Lute's heart on fire!

441
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,625
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!

442

[LUTE]
Hey, guys, it's me, Lute!

Right now, we're enjoying
a nice, relaxing cruise

00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,625
to Naubaka Island.

445

Or at least, we were enjoying
it, until the Seregios attacked!

Next time: "All-Out
Airborne Assault!"
