1
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:09,750
[NARRATOR]
These youngsters are Riders,

2
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:12,291
on a quest to track down
blackened Kinship Ore

3
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:18,041
and stop the Black Blight that's
been spreading across the world.

4
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,291
Despite growing up
together like brothers,

5
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:23,958
Lute and his best friend
Cheval parted ways.

6
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,041
Disenchanted and
seeking answers,

7
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:29,500
Lute underwent an introspective
trial at the Tower of Illusion,

8
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:33,458
ultimately learning what the
power of Kinship really is.

9
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,791
[CHIEF OMNA]
Impressive, isn't it?

10
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:39,125
This is the suit of
armor your father wore

11
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:42,291
when he was just about
your age, Lute.

12
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,916
From my dad?

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,541
[NARRATOR]
Lute inherited a suit of armor

14
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,333
from his late father, and now,

15
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:51,166
taking to heart all of the
feelings contained within it,

16
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,458
continues on his journey.

17
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,666
You got a sec?

18
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,250
[LUTE]
Mr. Reverto? Is something wrong?

19
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,625
[REVERTO]
Hm? Rathalos gear, huh?

20
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,625
That's right,
my dad left it for me.

21
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:23,791
I see. Well, use it with care.

22
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:29,000
Anyway, Lute, I'd like you
to help me with a Quest.

23
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,416
A Quest?

24
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,208
Yeah, we'd love to, but we're
a little busy right now,

25
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,791
saving the world from
the Black Blight.

26
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,041
Well, actually,
it just so happens

27
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,083
the target monster for
this particular Quest

28
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,625
is one that's been afflicted
with the Black Blight.

29
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,833
Well, in that case...

30
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,208
[NAVIROU]
Hmm...

31
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,833
Another Blighted monster?

32
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,458
Yes, I'm afraid so.

33
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:57,958
A real tough customer who's
tearing up the Babda Rainforest.

34
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,666
Well, then we should
dispatch a Rider to--

35
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,958
[SIMONE]
That won't be necessary.

36
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,208
I'm leaving this
entirely up to Reverto.

37
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,208
Oh, Captain Simone!

38
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,791
I don't mean to
question your judgment,

39
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,250
but if the monster is Blighted,

40
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,083
then won't Reverto
need the Kinship Stone?

41
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:16,833
Yes, which is why he'll
be bringing Lute.

42
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:21,375
Still, I'd like it to be Reverto
who puts this to rest.

43
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,791
Hey, why're you
tagging along, Popola?

44
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:33,166
Come on, can't leave Reverto
flying solo on this one.

45
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,333
Always gotta stick
your nose in, huh?

46
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,791
[LUTE]
So the Blighted monster's

47
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,875
s'posed to be 'round
here somewhere?

48
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,208
[REVERTO]
Yep.

49
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,291
[POPOLA] According to
the Scriveners, at least.

50
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,375
[gasps]

51
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,750
Mister, what's goin' on?

52
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,833
[LUTE]
Whoa, what's that?

53
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,541
[NAVIROU] A road? In the
middle of the jungle?

54
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,875
[REVERTO]
That is a monster path.

55
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,375
Never heard of such a thing.

56
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,583
It's just a path formed
by large monsters

57
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,000
as they pass through
the vegetation.

58
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,458
Well, a pretty big monster
must've made this one then,

59
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,041
judging by the width of it.

60
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,250
Yeah.

61
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,041
My guess is, it came through
this area a few days ago.

62
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:21,875
So in that case, wouldn't it
be a long way off by now?

63
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,583
Most likely.

64
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,875
Looks like the Black Blight's
spreading out here, too.

65
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,750
Ooh, that is one
funky-lookin' haze.

66
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,791
Hey, wait, what the
heck is that stuff?

67
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,166
Some kinda nectar?

68
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,208
No, don't!

69
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,500
[BOTH gasp]

70
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,125
[NAVIROU screams]

71
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,541
Watch yourselves.

72
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,791
That stuff was a
Brachydios slime mold.

73
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,458
A Brachydios?

74
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,791
Don't those usually
live in volcanic areas?

75
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,416
Why would one be out
here in the forest?

76
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,833
[REVERTO]
Well, on rare occasions,

77
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,750
a Brachydios will adapt to
live in another habitat,

78
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,583
but not this one.

79
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,291
This monster's lost.

80
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,958
It's originally from a volcano,

81
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,416
but being afflicted
with the Blight,

82
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,708
it probably doesn't even
know where it is anymore,

83
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,375
let alone how to get home.

84
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:10,000
Wait, how can you tell all that?

85
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,250
I didn't mention it before,
but this particular specimen

86
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:17,208
is a tempered monster that
I've been after for years.

87
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,291
Brachydios the Destroyer.

88
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,625
Brachydios the Destroyer?

89
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,041
A tempered monster?

90
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:24,875
[SIMONE]
Yes.

91
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,916
Every once in a great while,

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,375
a tremendously powerful
aberration of a monster

93
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,208
may crop up within a species.

94
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,583
So if it's
tremendously powerful,

95
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,041
does that mean it's immortal?

96
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,791
Well, obviously,
no living creature

97
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,083
is ever actually immortal.

98
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,666
But a monster at that level
would be nearly impossible

99
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,791
for the average
Hunter to defeat.

100
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,083
The Guild gives these
monsters special names,

101
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,833
and they always take
great care to issue

102
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,916
these extra-dangerous Quests
with an abundance of caution.

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,583
Because of their strength,

104
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,375
the Hunters have come
to respectfully refer

105
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,875
to these creatures as
"tempered monsters."

106
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:01,041
I see. So that's why
it had to be Reverto.

107
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:05,625
Well, yes, but also, they
have a history, those two do.

108
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,541
Oh, huh?

109
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:12,250
[REVERTO] The Guild named it
"Brachydios the Destroyer."

110
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,041
[POPOLA] All of the Hunters who
tried to slay it were defeated,

111
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,041
one after another.

112
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,958
[REVERTO]
When I first encountered it,

113
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,458
I was just starting out
with the Guild.

114
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,750
Hot-blooded as I was,

115
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,000
I decided to take on
a tempered monster

116
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,125
to make a name for myself.

117
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,708
Just so happened
to be that Brachy.

118
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:46,583
[REVERTO]
Wait up, Brachy. I'm still...

119
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,416
[REVERTO]
I faced it over and over again,

120
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,791
but every single time, it
wrecked me something fierce.

121
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,333
[REVERTO]
I haven't lost yet.

122
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,791
[REVERTO]
Brachy!

123
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,958
[REVERTO]
That day marked a turning point.

124
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,916
Brachy just vanished,
and there was no word

125
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,666
of any other Hunter
finishing it off.

126
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,708
I've wondered about
it ever since.

127
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:35,833
That's gotta be some monster
if it's even too much for you.

128
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:39,000
Just a regular Brachydios
is nothing to sneeze at,

129
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,041
but a tempered one?

130
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,791
That can't be good at all.

131
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,541
[whimpers]

132
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,833
You're not kidding.
I couldn't land a single blow.

133
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,375
And when I looked into its eyes,

134
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:52,083
I felt like... it was
saying something.

135
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,625
[LUTE]
Really? Like what?

136
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,625
[REVERTO]
"Surpass me."

137
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,916
Y'know, that's a pretty Rider-y
thing for you to say, Mister.

138
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,625
Yeah, I guess it is, but that's
what it felt like to me, anyway.

139
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,625
Seriously? A monster
talking to a Hunter?

140
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,791
Mew know that could
never happen, right?

141
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,500
No, I think maybe it could.

142
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,083
[OTHERS]
Hm?

143
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,375
Monsters have minds
of their own.

144
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,375
And if it could happen
with any Hunter,

145
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,958
then I think it'd
have to be you.

146
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,041
Yeah, maybe so.

147
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:29,250
But now there's no way
I'll ever be sure.

148
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,958
After all, that beast has been
stricken with the Black Blight.

149
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:37,208
It's no longer "Brachydios
the Destroyer," not anymore.

150
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,375
Wow, so even
super-tough monsters

151
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,500
can be stricken with the Blight.

152
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,541
All I know is,

153
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,333
I've gotta resolve
things with that monster.

154
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:51,750
The Captain of the Scriveners
has given me that opportunity.

155
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,333
Oh, you mean Simone?

156
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,375
That's right.

157
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,708
She knows all about
the connection

158
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,333

I could bring you along.

321
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:48,208
Ratha! Full speed ahead!

322
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:04,541
Brachydios the Destroyer, I will
stop you and the Black Blight!

323
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,000
Thanks to my Kinship with Ratha!

324
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,250
You've got Kinship
with Navirou, too!

325
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,666
And with my father, as well.

326
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,708
All this Kinship will
be my strength!

327
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,625
What's that light?

328
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:24,250
Now climb!

329
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,750
[yells]

330
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,958
Ya see that?

331
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,833
That was an even sky-er,
higher Sky-High Dive!

332
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:58,750
Now that is what Navirou
calls a Sky Extreme!

333
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,583
"Two kinships shall
be joined together,

334
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,875
as the Hunter becomes the Rider.

335
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,041
When there is Kinship,
then there is light.

336
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:11,208
When there is no Kinship,
there is darkness.

337
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,250
And the Black Dread
born out of the darkness

338
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:17,541
will stain both heaven and
earth as blackest jet."

339
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,625
Hey, wait, that's from the
mural of Redan, isn't it?

340
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,416
Yes, and I've been thinking,

341
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,416
the Black Blight isn't just
the Riders' problem.

342
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,083
Better to say this is
a problem for Hunters,

343
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,958
indeed, all humans to face.

344
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,791
Fortunately, I'm confident
Reverto will understand that.

345
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,750
And that's why you
gave him this Quest.

346
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,125
[NAVIROU] The Black
Blight is disappearing!

347
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,958
Brachydios the Destroyer,

348
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:54,541
you have truly been
my finest friend.

349
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,041
Reverto.

350
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:59,625
Uh, Mister, were we
right to do this?

351
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,791
[REVERTO]
Yes.

352
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:06,125
So, Hunters can form Kinship
with monsters, too, huh?

353
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,291
Yep.

354
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,916
[REVERTO]
Thanks to you,

355
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,125
I think I finally get
what you meant

356
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,875
about how we're two
sides of the same coin.

357
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,416
It's up to us to stop
the Black Blight,

358
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,750
and stop your friend, too.

359
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:36,541
[NAVIROU]
<i>Monstie Manual</i> !

360
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,458
Here comes the part
where Navirou

361
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,000
tells you about Monsties.

362
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,000
All right, Navirou
hopes you have

363
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,208
your Media Trigger
Smart Phone app open.

364
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,666
Better get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

365
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:51,833
And now, it's time to form
a Kinship with our Monsties!

366
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,916
The moment of new life!

367
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,125
Awaken!

368
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:02,750
[NAVIROU] Our Monstie
this time is: Brachydios!

369
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:05,666
It doles out ultra-effective
blows with its giant front legs,

370
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,041
just like a boxer!

371
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:10,000
And its exploding slime-mold
attack is a real doozy!

372
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,708
No wonder Reverto
was so obsessed

373
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,833
with this tempered monster!

374
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:17,333
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!

375
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:19,500
[LUTE]
Cheval sent Rathi away,

376
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:22,833
but is that really what you want
as your new Monstie, Cheval?

377
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:25,541
Next time: "The
Nargacuga Returns"!

378
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:26,875
Ride On!
