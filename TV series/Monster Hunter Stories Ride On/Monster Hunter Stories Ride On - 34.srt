During one of our interviews,

00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,250
a Felyne from
outside the village

171
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,291
claimed to have spotted
something closely resembling

the pickle weight in the forest.

173
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,083
Based on her description,
it was the right size, too.

Small enough to lift by hand.

Huh. Forest.

The weird part is,

00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,291
according to our witness,
it seems this pickle weight

180

ran right through the

Hold on, the pickle weight ran?

182

I didn't know pickle
weights could run.

183

They most certainly cannot.

That's right, supposedly,

this pickle weight was
surrounded by a black haze!

Black haze?

Well, if I found it,

that frightful

While that may be true,

230
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,458
your pickle weight
has to be in there
