1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,500
[NARRATOR]
These youngsters are Riders,

2
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:12,083
on a quest to track down
blackened Kinship Ore

3
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:17,666
and stop the Black Blight that's
been spreading across the world.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,875
Thanks to the efforts
of Lute and his friends,

5
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,541
peace has been restored
to Geo-Fulkright.

6
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:25,333
However, before they could
bask in their victory,

7
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:29,000
Pansy had some alarming
news to share with Navirou.

8
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:32,333
[PANSY] You see, Koapni
Village is in a lot of trouble.

9
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,833
I need mew to come back
with me to help save it!

10
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,166
What?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,083
[PANSY]
A monster attacked.

12
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,916
One that's all dark
and hazy and sick.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,625
[BOTH gasp]

14
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,250
Sounds like--

15
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,291
The Black Blight!

16
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:50,666
Navirou. We're going.

17
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,958
Right!

18
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:56,958
I'm coming, too.

19
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,333
There's a liner that goes
to the island from here.

20
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:02,083
All right, next stop,
Naubaka Island!

21
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,333
[DMIR]
Sorry,

22
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,875
but I'm afraid the liner
isn't running anymore.

23
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:08,041
[gasps] Why not?

24
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,625
Ships that are bound
for Naubaka Island

25
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,916
have been disappearing lately.

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,541
Far too many of them.
And nobody really knows why.

27
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,416
It could just be the rough seas,

28
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,833
but there's always
the possibility

29
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:31,916
it's some kind of monster.

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,750
Oh, no!

31
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,125
After enough ships vanished,

32
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,541
they stopped sending
out the liners, too.

33
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,291
All of the sailors are spooked.

34
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,083
They won't launch to
the north at all anymore.

35
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,541
I guess that means Ratha
will have to fly us there.

36
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,750
[NAVIROU yelps]

37
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,250
[NAVIROU] That idea
makes Navirou nervous!

38
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,875
[AVINIA]
Frostfang can fly, too.

39
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,583
I wouldn't if I were you.

40
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,458
Even the airships that
have headed that way

41
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,875
were sensing danger
and turning back around.

42
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,625
After all, if anything
were to happen,

43
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,416
there'd be no place
to land out there.

44
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,541
But there has to be some way
for us to get to the island.

45
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,666
Why, even as we speak,

46
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,833
that sick monster could
be wreaking havoc

47
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,416
on Koapni Village.

48
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,541
[DMIR]
Hm...

49
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,375
You know what?

50
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,083
There is one man
who might be willing

51
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,708
to take you guys out there.

52
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,166
Huh? Who's that?

53
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,541
A man who calls himself
the Bandit Captain.

54
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,583
[NAVIROU] "Bandit"? Navirou
thinks you mean "pirate."

55
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:25,125
No, for some reason he
chooses to go by "bandit."

56
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,500
Strange fella, that guy.

57
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,208
[CAPTAIN]
This is gonna be so good!

58
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,750
[CAPTAIN]
Yummy!

59
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,833
Uh, hey, Mr. Bandit Captain?

60
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,625
[CAPTAIN]
Hm? What do you want?

61
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,333
[BOTH gasp]

62
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,041
He really is a bandit!

63
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,458
I'm frightened!

64
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,458
Sorry, but we're trying
to get to Naubaka Island,

65
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,250
but the usual liners
aren't running,

66
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:06,250
and we heard that you might
be willing to take us there.

67
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,791
[CAPTAIN]
Why?

68
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:08,500
"Why"?

69
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,458
Well, um, because, uh,

70
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,750
there's a monster that's
running amok on the island

71
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,125
and we're going to slay it.

72
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:15,958
[CAPTAIN]
Why?

73
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,708
Uh, well--

74
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,666
Bet he's just looking
for an excuse to say no.

75
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,791
The villagers are
in big trouble.

76
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,291
We think the monster
might be Blighted.

77
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,583
[CAPTAIN] Isn't it forbidden for
Riders to leave their villages?

78
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,583
[LUTE]
Huh?

79
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:34,000
We left to stop the changes
happening around the world.

80
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,750
[CAPTAIN] I see. Such are
the times we live in.

81
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:37,958
Yeah, so, um--

82
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,083
[CAPTAIN]
All right.

83
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,166
[NAVIROU]
Uh?

84
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,041
Let's do it!

85
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,208
What? You'll take us there?

86
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,250
[CAPTAIN]
I'll bring my ship to the port!

87
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,666
[CAPTAIN]
Get ready and wait for me there!

88
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,416
That was awesome.

89
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,916
Could he actually be a good guy?

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,958
Let's not jump to
conclusions yet.

91
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,416
Oh, wow.

92
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,541
Guess that "bandit" title
isn't just for show.

93
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:28,291
Well, it sure doesn't look like
a good guy's ship to Navirou!

94
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,000
In fact, it seems like the kinda
boat Manelger would have.

95
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,166
Oh, no, that's terrifying!

96
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,250
This beauty is proof that
I'm an old hand at this!

97
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,666
I christened her the <i>S.S. TF</i> !

98
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,500
The <i>S.S. TF</i> ?

99
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,958
Don't worry, guys,

100
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,625
the Bandit Captain
here's made it through

101
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,375
more than his fair share
of monster attacks.

102
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,291
You'll be in good
hands with him.

103
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,000
Load up your cargo!

104
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,500
I wanna set sail before
the wind changes!

105
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,916
Well, the only cargo
we've got is our Monsties.

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,458
[DEBLI]
Did someone say cargo?

107
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,875
Well, I've got plenty and looks
like I made it just in time!

108
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,666
Huh? Why are you tagging alo--?

109
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,833
Don't you have any sympathy

110
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:02,958
for those poor,
helpless Felynes?

111
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,291
How can you be so heartless?

112
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,083
Wait. What are you
so mad at me for?

113
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,750
Uh. Those Felynes are
all alone out there!

114
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,833
With no ships traveling
to Naubaka Island,

115
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,375
they've gotta be running
dangerously low

116
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,000
on supplies by now!

117
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,500
Which is why I'm going
there to lend a helping hand!

118
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,041
I've got all kinds of great
merchandise to give 'em!

119
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,750
Whoa, for free?

120
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:25,958
At a discount.

121
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,458
So it's business!

122
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:30,291
[CAPTAIN] All right, time to
hoist those sails, Mew Crew!

123
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:36,166
[CREW]
Meow! Meow! Meow!

124
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:41,041

Island! Steady as she goes!

125
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,000

Come back again sometime!

126
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,666
Bye for now, you guys!

127
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,000
Come meet up with us

128
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,458
once the ocean liner's up
and running again, okay?

129
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,166
Roger that, meow! See ya soon!

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,583
Y'know, this is my
first time on a ship.

131
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,500
Yeah, mine, too!

132
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,041
Oh, right, you both grew
up in the mountains.

133
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,500
This ain't my first boat.

134
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,583
There's always cool
stuff below deck.

135
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,750
Let's go explore!

136
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,166
[LUTE]
Ooh, sounds good!

137
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,166
[FIRST MATE]
But first--

138
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,666
If mew have time
to wander around,

139
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,750
then mew have time
to do some fishing.

140
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,541
[LUTE]
Hm? Fishing?

141
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,583
Yeah, you're gonna need some
fish to feed your Monsties.

142
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,541
And the only thing that
we've got on board is hay.

143
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,125
Well, then, let's fish!

144
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:36,416
Awesome! Navirou will
show you how it's done!

145
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:50,125
Now listen, when you feel
your fishing pole go bing,

146
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,666
that's when you're gonna go
hup, and yank it back in.

147
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,250
Bing, and then you hup.

148
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,541
Bing, and then hup.
Bing, and then hup.

149
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,125
Goes bing, and you hup.

150
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,291
Bing, bing, then hup.
Bing, bing, then hup, hup.

151
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,916
Bing, then hup. Bing,
bing, then hup, hup.

152
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,041
Bing, bing, then hup!
All together!

153
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,375
Bing, bing, then hup, hup...

154
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,583
Knock it off!

155
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,541
And anyway, shouldn't
you be fishing, too?

156
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,458
Those rods are too big
for Navirou's little paws.

157
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,416
[LUTE gasps]

158
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,333
I got a bite!

[CAPTAIN]
What is it?

00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,416
Why do you call yourself
a "bandit captain"

207
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,000
and not a "pirate captain"?

208
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,083
Out here on the high seas,
pirates are ubiquitous.

209
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,333
That's why I'm a bandit instead.

And how did you
know about Riders?

Okay.

Curious about the
Bandit Captain, eh?

218
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,041
He was born and raised
in the mountains.

Oh, wow, really?

220
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,041
As a young man,

221
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,541
his passion for the sea
lured him away from home

222
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,666
and he became a sailor.

once he's become the
world's best sailor,

00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,375
but guess he ain't done it yet.

226
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:41,000
The mountains thing
explains the bandit name.

227
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,166
But how's he supposed to know

228
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,375
when he's become the
world's best sailor?

229
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:47,083

he mounts an Elder Dragon horn

as a figurehead on the bow.

And nobody really knows why.

It could just be rough seas,

possibly it's a monster.

It looks like that

That would explain why it keeps
attacking us haphazardly.

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,416
And it must be
what's been causing

319
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,583
Now, before it's too late, Lute,

320
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,083
Ride On with Rathalos
and do your thing!

321
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:43,208
[groaning]

322
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,333
[NAVIROU yelps]

323
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,208
[NAVIROU]
Is it really that bad, Lute?

324
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,166
So wait, you mean Lute's
out of commission?

325
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,291
[CAPTAIN]
Hey! What're you doing?

326
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:01,541
[DEBLI]
Avinia!

327
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:02,541
[PANSY]
Avinia?

328
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,291
All right then,
Ride On! Barioth!

329
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,666
Let's go!

330
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:16,458
Avinia! Watch out
for flying scales!

331
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,541
Hang in there, Frostfang!

332
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,208
Okay, Lute! You've
gotta help Avinia!

333
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:33,125
Get up! Get on your
feet, Lute, right now!

334
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:39,291
C'mon, buddy,
stand up! Right now!

335
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,541
Uh!

336
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,416
Here goes. Let's Ride On!

337
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,500
[NAVIROU] Ah! Is it
really that bad, Lute?

338
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,666
[DEBLI]
Then I'll do it!

339
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,625
Okay, Ride On!

340
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,291
Rathalos!

341
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,791
Huh?

342
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:07,041
Bad news, you guys!
It's Rathalos!

343
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,166
He's seasick, too!

344
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,375
That's my Ratha.

345
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,666
He's always totally in
sync with me. Atta boy.

346
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,958
Are you serious? Who needs
that level of Kinship?

347
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:29,958
[roars]

348
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,375
Now dive!

349
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,833
[AVINIA]
Here goes, Frostfang!

350
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,708
Icicle Fang, now!

351
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:54,916
[CAPTAIN]
Where'd they go?

352
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:58,958
[CAPTAIN]
Did they get it?

353
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,541
[CAPTAIN]
What the--?

354
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,041
Here it comes!

355
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,666
Ground Cyclone!

356
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,375
Yeah!

357
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,333
Wow, that girl,
she's somethin' else!

358
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,208
Good news, Lute! We did it!

359
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,166
[LUTE groaning]

360
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,458
[NAVIROU] Huh? Is it
really that bad, Lute?

361
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:53,791
It's Naubaka Island! Land ho!

362
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,416
[DEBLI]
Whoa!

363
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,500
Oh, wow, so that's
Naubaka Island?

364
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:05,208
We're finally back, Navirou.

365
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,458
Yeah.

366
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,625
At last.

367
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:14,125
I can't wait to set foot
on solid ground again.

368
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,208
[PANSY] This is heaven for
fans of Felyne pawpads.

369
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,166
Uh, I mean,
it's Felyne paradise.

370
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,833
Naubaka Island.

371
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,750
We all live together in a
place called Koapni Village.

372
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,375
Bet I can do some real
wheelin' and dealin'!

373
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,458
It looks so calm and peaceful.

374
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,166
What kind of dangerous monster
could be lurking here?

375
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,041
Don't know.

376
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,208
But I bet we're gonna find out.

377
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,916
[CAPTAIN]
So long, you guys!

378
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,208
[LUTE] Thanks, Bandit Captain!
You leaving already?

379
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,666
We are!

380
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,916
Gotta get back to Geo-Fulkright.

381
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,541
Tell folks there
everything's all clear now.

382
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,708
They hear that, the liner
will be running in no time.

383
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:57,958
Sounds good!

384
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,625
All right, time to hoist
those sails, Mew Crew!

385
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:04,583
[CREW] Aye aye, Captain!
Aye aye, Captain!

386
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:09,000
[CAPTAIN] Now <i>S.S. TF</i> ,
set a course for Geo-Fulkright!

387
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,166
Let's catch as much
wind as we can.

388
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,458
In top form!

389
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,916
[LUTE, NAVIROU]
Uh?

390
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,166
"In top form"?

391
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:16,916
But how?

392
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,875
[CAPTAIN laughing]

393
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:21,041
Well, say hi to Dan for me!

394
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:24,083
What the heck?

395
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:27,000
[SILVA laughing]

396
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:36,625
[NAVIROU]
<i>Monstie Manual</i> !

397
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,500
Here comes the part
where Navirou

398
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,083
tells you about Monsties.

399
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,041
All right, Navirou
hopes you have

400
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,250
your Media Trigger
Smart Phone app open.

401
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,708
Better get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

402
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:51,833
And now, it's time to form
a Kinship with our Monsties!

403
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,958
The moment of new life!

404
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,291
Awaken!

405
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:02,916
[NAVIROU] Our Monstie
this time is: Seregios!

406
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,833
It's one sharp customer!

407
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,625
This wyvern bristles
with tons of spiky scales

408
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:08,916
it can spray out.

409
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,541
Plus, it's fast and nimble,

410
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:13,875
so it'd make one heck
of a great Monstie!

411
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:17,916
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!

412
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,375
[LUTE]
Hey, Lute here!

413
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,375
We're in for a
real Felyne welcome

414
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,000
once we reach Koapni Village,

415
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,625
but there's something
weird about Navirou.

416
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:28,208
Yikes! A Yian Garuga!

417
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:30,791
Next time: "The Wolf
Raven Strikes Back"!

418
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:31,916
Ride On!
