00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:09,750
[NARRATOR]
These youngsters are Riders,

2
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:12,291
on a quest to track down
blackened Kinship Ore

3
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:16,375
and stop the Black Blight that's
been spreading across the world.

4
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:18,000
Different opinions
about monsters

5
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,625
drove Lute and Cheval apart,

6
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:24,083
and led to Cheval attacking
his former best friend.

7
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,583
The boys mounted their Monsties

8
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:28,000
and were ready to settle
things once and for all,

9
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:30,375
but neither Ratha nor Rathi
could bring themselves

10
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:33,250
to attack the other.

11
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,291
Disenchanted and
seeking answers,

12
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:40,041
Lute underwent an introspective
trial at the Tower of Illusion.

13
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,125
Meanwhile, Cheval returned to
his friends Mille and Hyoro,

14
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,541
unaware that Dr. Manelger
was once again

15
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,541
trying to get his help.

16
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,208
[distant roar]

17
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,375
[HYORO]
Hey. Wait, a second.

18
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:02,625
Why do you have a
Velocidrome now, Cheval?

19
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:06,791
Didn't you leave with Rathi?
What happened to her?

20
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,291
She's gone.

21
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:12,333
I don't want a Monstie
that I can't use.

22
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:15,500
[DR. MANELGER]
Cheval!

23
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,625
Cheval, I'm back!

24
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:20,708
Cheval! Cheval,
my boy! I'm back!

25
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:23,416
He's so excited to see you,
he said it twice!

26
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,958
It's Manelger.

27
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,291
He's bad news.

28
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:30,166
[DR. MANELGER]
Cheval, my boy! Come with me!

29
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,833
I have something to show you!

30
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:39,125
[HYORO gasps]

31
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,333
Whoa! Hey, look!

32
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:44,000
Isn't that the white
dragon egg?

33
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,583
Yeah, that's the same one
Cheval couldn't get to hatch.

34
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:47,708
[MILLE]
Huh?

35
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,041
[DR. MANELGER]
Cheval, my boy!

36
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,500
Right this way, my boy!

37
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,500
You'll be interested to
learn I recently obtained

38
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,375
a shard of Kinship Ore!

39
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,708
From this fragment,

40
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:03,125
I intend to craft my very
own Kinship Stone.

41
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,541
And once it's ready,

42
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,541
you can use it to form Kinship
with the white dragon!

43
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:11,083
It's the culmination
of his life's research!

44
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,916
How long will the stone take?

45
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,291
If I'm being honest...

46
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,875
If you're being honest?

47
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,833
If he's being honest.

48
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,458
I don't know when!

49
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,583
You don't?!

50
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,000
Of course I don't know!

51
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,625
I'm doing something no
man's ever done before!

52
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,250
But I will get it done,
that much I promise you!

53
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,083
Just watch. I promise you,
I will get it done!

54
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:38,708
He means it so much
that he even said it twice!

55
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,500
But it is possible, right?

56
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,750
Yes!

57
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,583
And once this new Kinship
Stone is complete,

58
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:44,750
it will be yours to have!

59
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:45,958
Do you understand?

60
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,791
My dear boy, you will
be the first person

61
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,875
to ride a white dragon
in a thousand years!

62
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,166
I see.

63
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,500
But, Cheval.

64
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,666
You actually trust this guy?

65
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,958
Are you two ready?

66
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:58,500
Huh?

67
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,500
For what? Why?

68
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,166
Let's go.

69
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:01,625
What?

70
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:02,666
Go where?

71
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,375
We're not gonna
stay here and wait,

72
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,750
we're gonna do what Riders do.

73
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,458
[HYORO]
Uhh...

74
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,333
Good!

75
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:11,791
We don't really have enough room

76
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,375
for you kids to stick
around anyway,

77
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:16,000
so do whatever you like
in the meantime.

78
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,833
Let's slay some
Blighted monsters.

79
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,666
But where should
we start looking?

80
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,083
I guess we could try
the Hunters Guild first.

81
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,791
They might even give us a Quest.

82
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,333
We're not going
back to the Guild.

83
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,791
I know another place
than can help.

84
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,750
See any Blighted monsters?

85
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,250
And who are you?

86
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,375
Have you seen Blighted
monsters, yes or no?

87
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,416
You're talking awfully big
for a kid playing dress-up.

88
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,208
[FAHALI]
He's not just some kid.

89
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,166
[HUNTER A]
Hm? Fahali!

90
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,125
He and his friends are Riders.

91
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,125
[HUNTERS]
Hm?

92
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,083
What? She's kidding, right?

93
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,541
[FAHALI]
Nope.

94
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,750
They're some of the Riders
who saved Albrachs Village.

95
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,916
[HUNTER A] You kids were
part of that group?

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,375
You celebrating another
successful Quest?

97
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,416
Yeah, and it was
a dangerous one.

98
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,625
This is the best way to recover.

99
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,166
But enough about me, are
you gonna answer the kids?

100
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,625
Oh, right, what did he want?

101
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:29,958
Blighted monsters.

102
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,208
Anyway, yeah, we've been
hearing stories, lately,

103
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,583
about a real nasty one
that lives on the outskirts

104
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,625
of the desert.

105
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,458
And you're positive
it's Blighted?

106
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,500
[HUNTER A] Haven't seen it,
so we couldn't tell ya.

107
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,000
But we have heard
it's a Black Diablos.

108
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,250
Is a Black Diablos
supposed to be stronger

109
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,375
than a regular Diablos?

110
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,708
[HUNTER B]
Sure seems that way,

111
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,875
considering no one's
brought her down yet.

112
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,166
[CHEVAL]
I see.

113
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,458
[MILLE]
Hey, wait up!

114
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,750
[HYORO]
Cheval!

115
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,125
The other Rider we met was a
lot friendlier than that group.

116
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:01,208
Well, I guess Riders
come in many stripes.

117
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,958
Hey, bartender! Why
don'tcha keep them comin'?

118
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,583
[HYORO] Cheval, what are
we doing in the forest?

119
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:12,041
Yeah, last I checked,
Diablos is a desert monster.

120
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,875
And Diablos are
also very strong.

121
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,916
I need a Monstie that can
stand up to their power.

122
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,458
[HYORO]
Whoa! A Royal Ludroth?

123
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,625
You can find all kinds of
monsters in a forest this thick.

124
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,500
[roaring]

125
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,125
[BOTH]
Huh?

126
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:40,875
Oh, no!

127
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,500
Nargacuga!

128
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,708
Hyoro! Mille! We're
gonna take it down!

129
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:47,791
What?

130
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,375
But it's not infected
with the Blight!

131
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,333
[CHEVAL]
Let's drive it out.

132
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,958
But, Cheval.

133
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,333
[CHEVAL]
You'll do it...

134
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,750
...'cause you're on my team.

135
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,333
--Now, Ride On!
--Ride On!

136
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,000
Monoblos!

00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,666
Tigrex, go!

138
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,625
Charge!

139
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:04,666
[HYORO]
Right!

140
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,083
[MILLE yelps]

141
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,458
[MILLE]
C'mon, Tigrex, shake it off!

142
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,750
[HYORO]
Double strike attack!

143
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,875
Breaking Crush!

144
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:27,833
All right!

145
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:31,000
Hey, Cheval, we drove it away!

146
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,291
What now?

147
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,875
[CHEVAL]
Found you.

148
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,500
You're perfect.

149
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,666
What kind of egg is this?

150
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,708
O holy Kinship Stone,

151
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,958
bind me together with
this slumbering creature!

152
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,208
[CHEVAL]
And now, the moment of new life!

153
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,750
Awaken!

154
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,625
[BOTH gasp]

155
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,708
[HYORO]
A Nargacuga?

156
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,583
Hold on, are you--?

157
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,250
[CHEVAL] That's right.
I'm making it my new Monstie.

158
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:39,458
Cheval, you can't do this.
A Nargacuga killed your--

159

[yelps]

160
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:45,791
Cheval, are you
sure about this?

161
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,958
[CHEVAL]
I need its speed.

162
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:51,750
[MILLE] But can you really form
Kinship with a Nargacuga?

163
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,041
[CHEVAL] We're going to
slay the Black Diablos.

164
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,041
[HYORO]
Ugh... I'm so hot!

165
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,041
Well, duh, Hyoro. That's
what happens in a desert.

166
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,666
[HYORO]
Hey. There're people up there.

167
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,500
Oh... The people turned out
to just be a cactus patch.

168
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,500
It should be close by.

169
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:19,250
Yeah, good thinking.
Diablos eat these cacti.

170
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,291
It's gonna be a tough battle.
How are we doing on items?

171
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,041
Good. We're fully stocked
up on potions and tools.

172
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,375
All right, tomorrow we
bring down the Diablos.

173
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,500
[CHEVAL]
This is for you, Mom.

174
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,000
[gasps]

175
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:12,125
Oh, man. I thought the heat
was bad, but now a sand storm?

176
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,875
[MILLE]
Cheval, we're getting nowhere.

177
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,250
Let's pack it in for the day.

178
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,666
[CHEVAL]
Don't be weak. This is nothing!

179
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,458
[HUNTER B screams]

180
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,583
[HUNTER B]
Run! Don't look back!

181
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,666
Ride On!

182
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,291
Rathalos!

183
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,416
[NAVIROU yelps]

184
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,875
Is that--?

185
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,125
[MILLE] I think those
are the same Hunters

186
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,208
we met in Albrachs Village.

187
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,833
[HUNTER A]
I thought we saw you!

188
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,750
[HUNTER B] If you're here
for the Black Diablos,

189
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,166
forget about it!

190
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,708
[HUNTER A] That's no ordinary
monster, she's a demon!

191
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,833
A rabid, violent, demon!

192
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,791
So she has been Blighted, then!

193
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:58,791
[roaring]

194
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,708
[HUNTERS gasp]

195
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,208
[HUNTER B]
Get outta the desert!

196
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,458
So what now?

197
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,541
[MILLE]
I don't know.

198
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,625
[CHEVAL]
Do you even have to ask? C'mon!

199
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,666
[BOTH gasp]

200
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,166
Do you really think it's
wise to go after a monster

201
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,500
that not even two
Hunters can handle?

202
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,333
[CHEVAL]
Those Hunters are weak.

203
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:20,541
Hyoro, Mille. We can do this!

204
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,458
[MILLE, HYORO]
Right.

205
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:27,875
[MILLE]
Wait!

206
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,416
Let's spread out!

207
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,250
There it is! The Black Diablos!

208
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,541
And it's definitely Blighted!

209
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,958
All right, let's Ride On!

210
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,333
Nargacuga!

211
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,416
Steady. This fight's
all about your speed.

212
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:09,375
[CHEVAL]
Dodge!

213
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,666
[MILLE gasps]

214
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,708
[MILLE]
Oh, wow.

215
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:15,833
[MILLE screams]

216
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,208
Now's our chance, Nargacuga!

217
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,875
Hyoro! Mille!

218
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,500
Now, Ride On!

219
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,416
Monoblos!

220
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,041
Let's Ride On!

221
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,125
Now, Tigrex!

222
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,000
You two, distract the Diablos!

223
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,500
[BOTH gasp]

224
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,583
Go! Make me an opening!

225
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,583
[MILLE]
Tigrex. Stone Toss!

226
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,583
Oh, no.

227
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,041
Killer Fang!

228
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,583
[CHEVAL]
What are you guys doing?

229
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,333
Get back in the fight!

230
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,125
[CHEVAL]
Now! Do it now!

231
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,791
Demolition Dash!

232
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,750
Tigrex, Rock Smash!

233
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,583
[MILLE]
How's that?

234
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,458
[MILLE yells]

235
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:08,250
[screaming]

236
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,458
Time for the Dark Thrash!

237
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:29,875
It worked.

238
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,166
We did it.

239
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,000
[MILLE]
How ya holdin' up, Tigrex?

240
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,541
[HYORO]
Monoblos, I'm so proud of you.

241
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,541
[CHEVAL]
You two were sloppy.

242
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,958
You were slow on
your follow-through.

243
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,458
You're no better than
a couple of Gargwa!

244
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,583
How rude!

245
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,625
Hey, we did our best
out there, Cheval.

246
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,291
Whoa. What's that?

247
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,041
Well, it can't be
the Blighted Diablos.

248
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,458
It's still lying right
where we left it!

249
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,916
[HYORO]
Oh, no! Another one?!

250
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,541
[MILLE]
There're two?

251
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,958
Wait, hold on.

252
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,458
Look, Cheval, this other
Diablos hasn't been Blighted!

253
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,458
That means we don't
have to slay it!

254
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,875
You're right. There's no
point in starting a fight.

255
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,083
Let's just leave it
alone and run away.

256
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,291
[CHEVAL]
Run?

257
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,041
[CHEVAL]
It is Blighted!

258
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,166
[MILLE]
What? No, it isn't!

259
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,458
But Blighted or not, we
should still get outta here

260
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:29,708
before it sees us.

261
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,125
Go! Nargacuga!

262
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,458
What's wrong?
Why're you backing down?

263
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,791
Attack, Nargacuga, attack!

264
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,541
Hyoro, Mille! Go! Now!

265
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:46,583
Cheval.

266
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,208
I swear, it's not Blighted!

267
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,208
Mille's right, Cheval.
Can't we just get out of here?

268
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:54,458
Because sooner or later this
monster will be Blighted!

269
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,750
We can stop that
before it happens!

270
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,458
Do it! Attack!

271
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,125
[CHEVAL]
Get up, Nargacuga!

272
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,916
[CHEVAL]
Dark Thrash!

273
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,041
[roar]

274
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:37,458
Coward! We have to finish it
off before it can escape.

275
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,125
[CHEVAL]
What are you doing?

276
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,250
Get up!

277
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,541
You haven't done
enough to be tired!

278
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:52,000
After it, you lazy beast!

279
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,916
Hyoro! Mille!

280
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,666
It's no use, Cheval.

281
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,625
It can't move!

282
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,250
[CHEVAL]
Get up!

283
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:06,041
C'mon, it's getting away!
Follow it, Nargacuga!

284
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,750
You failed me!

285
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,500
You're even more
useless than Rathian!

286
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,083
I don't need you, anymore.

287
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,333
So just get out of here.

288
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,291
[HYORO]
How could you say that?

289
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,958
[MILLE]
That poor Monstie.

290
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,541
Same goes for you!

291
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,000
Whaddaya mean?

292
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,791
The both of you are useless.

293
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:57,833
[BOTH gasp]

294
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,833
Well, I'm going to bed.

295
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,500
I mean it. I've had it
up to here with Cheval!

296
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:32,375
[HYORO] I'm not even
sure he likes us anymore.

297
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,708
It's pretty obvious
that he doesn't!

298
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:38,000
We're not friends to him.
We're pawns to order around!

299
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,833
Yeah. Right.

300
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,166
I also don't like him saying
that we're useless,

301
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,750
or that we're like Gargwa.

302
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,416
And using us as
decoys was real low.

303
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,375
I know. It's just not right.

304
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:57,791
I'm done. Do whatever
you want, Cheval.

305
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:01,875
[HYORO] I can't believe
all this time, I thought...

306
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,125
I really thought that
he was our friend.

307
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,041
[MILLE]
So did I.

308
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,166
[CHEVAL]
Mille? Hyoro?

309
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,166
Mille! Hyoro!

310
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,958
Mille! Hyoro!

311
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,500
Anyone? Where are you?

312
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,000
[CHEVAL]
Where did you go?!

313
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,333
Get me a measurement
on that spectrum, Itsy-Bits.

314
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,458
Yes, sir!

315
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,125
[CHEVAL]
It's still not ready?

316
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:40,666
Cheval! You've actually come
back at the perfect time!

317
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,458
[ITSY-BITS]
But why'd you come back alone?

318
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,125
[DR. MANELGER]
Well, that is odd.

319
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:47,041
Where are your confederates?

320
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,791
They were both useless,
so I got rid of them.

321
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,041
Well, Cheval, my boy,
you'll be happy to know

322
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,875
that I have no need for
those Riders, anyway.

323
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,333
[ITSY-BITS] Wait till you see
what we've come up with!

324
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,500
[DR. MANELGER]
Okay! Boost the power output!

325
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,541
[ITSY-BITS]
Right!

326
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,750
[DR. MANELGER]
Ah! Too high, too high!

327
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,583
[ITSY-BITS]
Sorry, Doctor!

328
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:21,208
You won't betray me.
I'm sure of it.

329
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,750
I hope you hatch soon.

330
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:36,500
[NAVIROU]
<i>Monstie Manual</i> !

331
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,500
Here comes the part
where Navirou

332
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,000
tells you about Monsties.

333
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,000
All right, Navirou
hopes you have

334
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,208
your Media Trigger
Smart Phone app open.

335
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,666
Better get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

336
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:51,833
And now, it's time to form
a Kinship with our Monsties!

337
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,916
The moment of new life!

338
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,125
Awaken!

339
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:02,125
[NAVIROU] Our Monstie this
time is: Royal Ludroth!

340
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:05,083
That big mane is used for more
than just looking fabulous!

341
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,541
It's where Ludroth stores
water for its attacks,

342
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,416
or so it can survive on land.

343
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,416
That's why, no matter
what environment it's in,

344
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,875
people call it,
"The Water Beast!"

345
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:17,375
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!

346
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:19,583
[LUTE] There's a Kinship
Ore on Mount Rhyz?

347
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:22,666
Well, then we better find
it before Dr. Manelger!

348
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,083
Next time: "Numbers, Assemble."

349
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,791
Ride On!
