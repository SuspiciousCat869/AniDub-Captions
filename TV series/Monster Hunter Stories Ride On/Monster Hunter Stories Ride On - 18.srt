1
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:10,875
[NARRATOR]
This young boy's name is Lute,

2
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:12,875
a rash but enthusiastic fellow,

3
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:18,666
who dreams of becoming
the world's top Monster Rider.

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,458
Lute and his fellow Riders
Cheval, Mille, and Hyoro

5
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:24,708
worked together to
defeat a Nargacuga,

6
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:29,166
who had been afflicted
with the Black Blight.

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,875
Afterwards, under the
guidance of Chief Omna,

8
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:34,333
these brave youngsters
embarked upon an adventure

9
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:38,750
to purify the world's
Kinship Ore.

10
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:42,541
Along the way, Lute and Navirou
stumbled upon Avinia,

11
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,750
a Rider who had fled
from another village

12
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,458
with her Barioth
Monstie, Frostfang.

13
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:50,375
The experience left all
three encouraged to discover

14
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:53,375
that they're not alone in their
mission to stop the Black Blight

15
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:56,458
and save the world.

16
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,125
And now, the band of Riders

17
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:01,166
finally arrives at
their destination!

18
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:07,791
Expect big things from Navirou!

19
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,583
[ALL]
Whoa.

20
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,416
[MILLE]
So this is Gildegaran.

21
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,541
[LUTE]
It's so big!

22
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:31,458
Wow, just get a load of
all these people here!

23
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,750
Everyone's so fashionable!

24
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:36,250
Man, this place is nothing
like Hakum Village.

25
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:39,458
Well, of course it isn't.
This city is Hunter central!

26
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,208
Hm. Navirou feels
an intense gaze.

27
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:43,708
Is that a Felyne there?

28
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,166
What weird whiskers.

29
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,375
Weird face, too.

30
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:47,875
He's weird all over.

31
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,875
[NAVIROU] Heh, seems everyone's
fascinated by ol' Navirou.

32
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,291
[NAVIROU laughs]

33
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:53,958
[LUTE]
C'mon, Navirou! We're leaving!

34
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,333
Wait up guys! Hey!

35
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,583
[chuckles]

36
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,166
Now there's some easy marks.

37
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,166
Excuse me, do you know
where I might be able

38
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,958
to find the Royal Scriveners?

39
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,291
The Scriveners?

40
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,458
[HUNTER B]
Hmm...

41
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,333
Oh, you may wanna
try the Hunter's Guild.

42
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,666
Uh, the Hunter's Guild?

43
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,333
[LUTE] Lilia isn't wasting
any time looking for Simone.

44
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,833
She must really wanna see her.

45
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,250
Yeah, well, I don't
get what's so great

46
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,750
about the Scriveners anyway.

47
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,791
Uh, hey, so have any
of you guys noticed

48
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,125
that we all look
completely different

49
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,791
from everybody else here?

50
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,083
Huh, you think so?

51
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,833
I guess maybe a little.

52
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,791
[NAVIROU] Yeah, Navirou was just
noticing how lame you guys look.

53
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,000
[DEBLI]
Hey, country bumpkins!

54
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,541
Must be your first time
here, am I right?

55
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,458
Well, not to worry,
I can show you around!

56
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,041
What do you want?

57
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,791
I'm the hottest Hunter in town!

58
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:47,791
You can call me Debli,
or for short, D.B.L!

59
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,541
Debli!

60
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,666
[ALL]
"Tubby"?

61
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,958
No, not Tubby! Debli! Debli!

62
00:04:56,041 --> 00:05:00,500
Ha. Just walk away.
Navirou's gut says you should.

63
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,000
Listen here, you--!

64
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,083
Don't mind him.

65
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,625
This guy's gut hasn't
been right once.

66
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:09,208
Ha! You seem like a fella
who knows what's what.

67
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,500
So where're you
fine folks from?

68
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,208
Oh, we're from a small
town called Hakum Vill--

69
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,291
Watch it, Lute!

70
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,625
You know we have
to keep the whole

71
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,000
"you-guys-being-Riders"
thing a secret.

72
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,708
Oh, yeah, right.

73
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:21,708
C'mon, let's get moving!

74
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,250
Ow, stop! Lilia,
that really hurts!

75
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,250
[DEBLI]
Hey! Wait! Come back here!

76
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,833
Dang.

77
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:35,750
Don't think that I'm just gonna
give up that easily, you rubes!

78
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,125
So then, what do we do now?

79
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:42,291
To eat a donut or a soufflé,
that is the question, is it not?

80
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,375
Well, I'd like to
find the Scriveners.

81
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,875
I wanna find an inn
and get situated.

82
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,416
Uh...

83
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,791
'Kay.

84
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,291
I'll go with Lilia to
track down the Scriveners.

85
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,375
Hyoro and Mille can
try to find an inn.

86
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,083
[HYORO]
Okay.

87
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,333
[MILLE]
Sure.

88
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,541
[LUTE]
What about you, Cheval?

89
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,833
Uh. I guess I'll--

00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:01,916
[BOY A laughing]

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,125
[MOM A]
Slow down!

92
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,583
You're gonna fall and
hurt yourself again!

93
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,833
[BOY A]
I'm fine, Mom!

94
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,625
I'll go look for an inn
with Hyoro and Mille.

95
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,791
I'm not big on crowded places.

96
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,166
Now just a minute!

97
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,041
First we need to get either
donuts or a soufflé!

98
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,458
Okay, so let's all meet
back here at noon then.

99
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,958
Sounds good!

100
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,416
Wait for Navirou!

101
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,500
[LUTE]
Wow!

102
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,625
Just look at all the
stuff they have here!

103
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,750
What the heck kind of
creature is that?

104
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:35,916
Is it a Felyne?

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,625
If it is, it's a weird one!

106
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,916
Oh, that is way beyond weird!

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,166
Don't let those jerks
get to you, Navi.

108
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,916
Yeah, that's right.
You're just you, Navirou!

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,125
Always the center of attention
wherever Navirou goes.

110
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,000
It's not easy being
a chosen one.

111
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,750
[laughs]

112
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,500
Nothing gets to Navi, huh?

113
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,583
Yeah, he can get
by no matter what.

114
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,500
[GENTOR]
Hey!

115
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,708
So it is you.

116
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,500
The outsiders who've
been causing a ruckus

117
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,166
throughout the town.

118
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,000
Well, there has been a little
fuss surrounding Navi, but--

119
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,666
What with being such an
awe-inspiring specimen and all.

120
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,625
And what are you, exactly?

121
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,375
Navirou, one of the chosen
Felyne, at your service.

122
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,666
I see. And where are
you travelers from?

123
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,083
Oh, we're from a small
town called Hakum--

124
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,333
I told you not to tell
anyone about that!

125
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,083
Oh, right, sorry.

126
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,291
Heh. Tangle with us and you're
gonna get burned, buddy.

127
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,375
So what you're saying is
that this little oddball

128
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,625
is a Felyne,

129
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,541
and you people can't say
where precisely it is

130
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,791
that you come from!

131
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,333
Pretty much.

132
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:39,375
Well, I don't know if that's
quite how I'd put it, but yeah.

133
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,791
Ah, yes, yes, so I see.

134
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,375
I understand it all
perfectly now.

135
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,833
Take them away!

136
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:46,750
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

[LUTE, NAVIROU scream]

138
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,333
But, sir, I promise you,
we're not shady or anything!

139
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,541
Navirou's face may be,
but that's all!

You can plead your case
back at the station.

[GUILD MASTER]
What's all this?

143
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,083
I apologize for the
sudden interruption,

144
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,541
Captain Gentor,
but would you mind

145
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,583
leaving these three
for me to deal with?

146
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,041
Huh? He looks kinda familiar.

147
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,625
Yeah, right?

[LUTE, NAVIROU, LILIA]
Whoa, "Master"?

151
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,875
Indeed!

152
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,791
This personage here hails from
the Hunter's Guild headquarters.

153
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,583
He is the Guild Master!

all about you little

Wait. You're saying that
you know Chief Omna?

00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,125
home of the Hunter's Guild.

161
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,833
So there you have it.

162
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:57,666
Omna and I grew up together, as
close as if we'd been brothers.

163
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,416
Wow, really?

164
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,791
Sounds a lot like you
and Cheval, actually.

165
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,791
Guess so.

166
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,083
Heh. Feels like I know you.

167
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,625
You must be...

168
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:10,750
Ah, yes, Lilia the All-Knowing.
You want to be a Scrivener.

169
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:11,958
Right!

170
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,666
[GUILD MASTER]
And you must be Lute.

171
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,041
I hear you hatched a Rathalos
without using a Kinship Stone.

172
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,333
Sure did!

173
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,833
[GUILD MASTER]
And you're Navirou!

174
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,416
That's right!

175
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,083
[GUILD MASTER] Your talent is,
well, it hasn't been mentioned.

176
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,333
[yelps]

177
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,458
Oh, of course, Lilia's
a master at combining.

178
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,541
Isn't that right?

179
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,458
Yep.

180
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,541
[LUTE, NAVIROU]
Oh, no, no, no.

181
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,708
What?

182
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,125
[LUTE, NAVIROU]
It's nothing. Never mind.

183
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,416
I've heard about it.

184
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,750
The Energy Drinks that you make

185
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,875
and how extremely
bitter they are.

186
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,250
Bitter as life itself!

187
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,250
That's right. So bitter!

188
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,416
Amazing! You really
do know everything!

189
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,833
Yes, Omna speaks very
highly of you all,

190
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,125
and in extensive detail.

191
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,958
In fact, from the way
he boasts about you,

192
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,916
I would say he practically
sees you as his own children.

193
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,625
Really? He does?

194
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,708
But going back, Energy Drinks
as bitter as life itself?

195
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,250
What does that even mean?

196
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,833
Jeez, let it go, Lilia. We were
having a real moment there.

197
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,750
Both sides of the
Hunter-Rider divide

198
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,166
could afford to understand
one another better.

199
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,708
Oh, yeah, that's for sure.

200
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,291
We've never left
the village before,

201
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,041
so there's a lot about Hunters
that we don't get at all.

202
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,958
Back home, we were
always under the belief

203
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,750
that everybody
grew up to be Riders,

204
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,833
forming Kinship with monsters.

205
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,125
But that just isn't
the case, is it?

206
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:29,166
Well, you see, in some
ways, it is in fact true,

207
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,333
while in other ways, it isn't.

208
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,916
[ALL]
Huh?

209
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,500
Hunters have to work hard, too.

210
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,958
They perfect their skills daily,

211
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,166
and make their living by
taking on hunting orders,

212
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,375
or as we call them, Quests.

213
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,875
Quests, huh?

214
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,791
Meanwhile, we here provide
support to aid in their hunting,

215
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,291
like sending Hunters
to base camp

216
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,916
and preparing
essential hunting tools

217
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
for them to use on their Quests.

218
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,333
Huh?

219
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,375
Oh, yes! I've got
a tremendous idea!

220
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,916
While you're here,

221
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,750
why don't I have you go on a
Quest just like the Hunters do?

222
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,916
It'll be a great
learning experience.

223
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,666
Yeah, that sounds like fun!

224
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,250
Just be careful, Lute.

225
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,791
You can't let anyone find out
that you're a Rider, remember.

226
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:09,541
This again? Why such secrecy?

to do with you?

for us to try to force
them to do anything.

You'd have to have really strong
Kinship with them for that.

Oh, and say hi to Simone for us.

319
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:55,333
So is she never gonna
come back again, ever?

320
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,250
[LUTE chuckles]

321
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,208
It's not like I care!

322
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,625
Fear not, Mille!

323
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,708
For the two of you are
bound by a deep Kinship.

324
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,458
You may be apart, but your
hearts will never let go!

325
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,000
Oh, that was good!
Yes, that was very good.

326
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,416
And very irritating.

327
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,916
Well, setting all
that aside for now,

328
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,958
we're still friends,
first and foremost.

329
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,041
I'm so excited! I finally
get to see the Red Swan!

330
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,000
Red Swan? And what is that?

331
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:34,125
Another name for Captain Simone.
She's my role model.

332
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,458
I wanna be just
like her someday.

333
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,791
[sighs]

334
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,500
Oh, Captain Simone.

335
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,500
Lilia!

336
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,833
Captain Simone!

337
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,541
I'm so glad you made it. Here.

338
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,458
Oh, Lilia, I'm thrilled
to see you again, truly.

339
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,125
Oh, yes, so am I!

340
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,958
Woohoo! Woohoo!

341
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,041
What a fine example
of a lieutenant.

342
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:05,250
He must be incredibly loyal.

343
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,875
[MILLE]
I don't see any inn.

344
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,666
But the map says it should
be around here somewhere.

345
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,625
Maybe it's over there?

346
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:13,916
[LUTE]
Huh?

347
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,458
[DEBLI laughs]

348
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,333
Well, fancy running into
you fine folks here!

349
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,291
[LUTE]
This guy? Again?

350
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,916
[HYORO]
It's, uh, De-De--

351
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,208
Tub-something!

352
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,291
No, no, I'm not Tub-anything!

353
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,916
I'm Debli, dang it!
Or, for short, D--!

354
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,291
Give it a rest, will you?

355
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,833
But I--

356
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,083
Uh, so what are you
doing here, anyway?

357
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,833
You're in our way, so move.

358
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,708
You sure about that?

359
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,875
The Forest of Confusion's that
way. It's dark even in daylight!

360
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,875
Plus it's crawling
with monsters!

361
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:43,791
[MILLE]
Yeah, and?

362
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,041
[CHEVAL]
Is there a problem?

363
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,583
Uh! I mean.

364
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,708
You should be prepared in case
you meet a monster out there!

365
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,291
Lucky for you guys,

366
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,541
I'm willing to sell you some of
my Debli-brand Hunter supplies!

367
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:56,791
No, thanks.

368
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:57,916
We don't need any.

369
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,291
That stuff's garbage.

370
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,625
[DEBLI]
No, it's not!

371
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,750
It's all very useful equipment
to have on a hunt!

372
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,583
[LUTE] Then we
definitely don't need it.

373
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,750
We're not going on a hunt.

374
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,291
[chuckles]

375
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,375
Well, then, I can't
be held responsible

376
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,041
if some black
monster attacks you!

377
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,291
Wait, a black monster?

378
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,625
Yup, that's right.

379
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,375
Rumor has it a
creepy black monster's

380
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,333
been showing up in
the forest lately.

381
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,541
[gong sounds]

382
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,250
What's that?

383
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,208
That's it!

384
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,083
What's "it"? What do you mean?

385
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,583
That alarm we're
hearing right now

386
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,250
means that a monster's
been spotted.

387
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,750
It sounds like it's coming
from the Forest of Confusion,

388
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,458
so that's where it must be!

389
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,708
Forest of Confusion.

390
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,166
Let's go.

391
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,083
[DEBLI]
Hey, don't blame me!

392
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:43,833
I tried to warn you.
Monsters are trouble.

393
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,583
[LUTE]
Which way back to our Monsties?

394
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,500
[NAVIROU]
Right! To the right!

395
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,791
[MILLE]
Straight ahead it is!

396
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,333
--[LUTE, CHEVAL, HYORO] Got it!
--[NAVIROU] Hey!

397
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,958
[LUTE]
There they are!

398
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,541
Hey, wait. Where'd mine go?

399
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,500
[roaring]

400
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,708
What?

401
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,208
So Blighted monsters
have started showing up

402
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,166
near the city now, too, really?

403
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,708
Yes.

404
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,500
I'm afraid the situation is
just as dire as you reported.

405
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,416
At least, the Hunters were
able to slay them right away,

406
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,583
so there was no damage, but...

407
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:16,875
That means the Black Blight
is starting to spread.

408
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,458
Seems that way.

409
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,833
For right now, we're
operating under the belief

410
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,541
that the most effective way
for us to stop the Blight

411
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,000
is to purify the Kinship Ore.

412
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,458
You demonstrated
that quite clearly.

413
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,416
Oh, that wasn't me.
It was my Rider friends.

414
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,791
They were the ones
courageous enough

415
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:39,041
to stand up to that
Blighted Nargacuga.

416
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,958
Still, they're your friends.

417
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,166
Yeah, well, I guess they are.

418
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,041
In any event, if we're
serious about preventing

419
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,541
any more of these monsters
from being Blighted,

420
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,583
then we can't merely
slay the Blighted beasts.

421
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:55,500
We also need to purify
the Kinship Ore.

422
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,916
You'll hear no objection
out of me, Captain Simone.

423
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,041
You have the full support
of the Hunter's Guild.

424
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,750
Thank you, sir.

425
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,416
[LUTE]
There it is.

426
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,166
[HYORO]
It's definitely Blighted.

427
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,791
We've gotta beat it.

428
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,250
Ride On!

429
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,333
Rathian!

430
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,708
All right, Ride On!

431
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,666
Velocidrome!

432
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:33,958
[LUTE]
Time to stop this!

433
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:37,083
You got it! Let's get
it on our level!

434
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,416
Yes!

435
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:45,583
Now! Charge!

436
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:46,916
[LUTE]
All right!

437
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,333
Whoa. What are these people?

438
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,166
They're awesome!

439
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,791
[gasps]

440
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,125
That's bad!

441
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:28,708
[gasps]

442
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,166
Amazing!

443
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:49,250
Riders. They must be the
ones I've heard about.

444
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,083
[LUTE]
Are you okay?

445
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,416
What do you mean?

446
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,291
[gasps]

447
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,500
What do I mean? Uh, you just--

448
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,333
Wow, Cheval! You were amazing!

449
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,666
Yeah, but it was almost
like that wasn't you at all.

450
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,375
It was just that--
if I hadn't've--

451
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:16,791
I thought that someone
would get hurt.

452
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,958
[DEBLI]
Hey! Ha-ha!

453
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,583
Oh, whoa! You guys are
like crazy powerful!

454
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:22,666
Where'd you come from?

455
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,916
Well, you were
pretty good, I guess,

456
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,083
but you, my friend,
were somethin' else!

457
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,416
You're like a real
top-of-the-line Hunter!

458
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
[CHEVAL]
Huh?

459
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,750
You really think so?

460
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,083
[DEBLI] Totally! You've
got a lotta potential!

461
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,833
Hey, look,
Cheval's cheering up.

462
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,791
[CHEVAL, DEBLI laughing]

463
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,166
Oh, man, am I beat!

464
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,583
We never did find
that inn, though.

465
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,208
[LILIA]
Hey, welcome back, guys!

466
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,416
Long time no see, eh?

467
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,041
Oh, wow! You're
already a Scrivener?

468
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:59,333
Well, uh, actually,
I'm still an apprentice.

469
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:02,041
Regardless, Lilia
is one of us now.

470
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:05,833
Oh, thank you, Simone.
I mean, Captain.

471
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,416
Good for you, Lilia!

472
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,291
The uniform looks good on you.

473
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,291
Aw, thanks, guys!

474
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,625
Oh!

475
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,958
I heard you did an amazing
job out there, Cheval.

476
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,541
Stopping that Kecha Wacha.

477
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:19,375
Yeah, well...

478
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:23,250
I just... wanna be stronger.

479
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:27,166
Strong enough to stop any
monster who's been Blighted.

480
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:36,625
[NAVIROU]
<i>Monstie Manual</i> !

481
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,416
Here comes the part
where Navirou

482
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,875
teaches you about Monsties.

483
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,916
Now then, Navirou hopes you have

484
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,208
your Media Trigger Smart
Phone app open for this.

485
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,500
And get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

486
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:51,708
Now it's time to form a
Kinship with our Monsties!

487
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:53,833
The moment of new life!

488
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:56,083
Awaken!

489
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:01,791
[NAVIROU] Our Monstie
this time is: Kecha Wacha!

490
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,708
That's one fancy-looking face!

491
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:06,250
The Kecha Wacha hops
around in the treetops,

492
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,833
using its tricky movements
to toy with its prey!

493
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:11,708
The mucus it shoots from
its nose is bad news, too!

494
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,000
It'd make a fine
Monstie, though!

495
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:18,000
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!

496
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,500
[LUTE]
Hey! Lute here!

497
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:22,833
First we wind up crashing at
ace Hunter Reverto's place,

498
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:26,875
and then I've gotta do a
Guild Quest all on my own?

499
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,208
Next time: "Nerscylla Blitz!"

500
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,708
Ride On!
