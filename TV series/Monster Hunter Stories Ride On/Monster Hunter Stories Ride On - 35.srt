[NAVIROU] Yes! Onward,

159
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,083
[NAVIROU]
So this is Redan's village?

160
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,708
[SIMONE]
No, just the path to it.

[LUTE groans]
I hope it's not too far.

Huh? Danger up ahead, gang!
Whole buncha Congalala!

What? Lemme see!

164
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,833
[NAVIROU] Look, there's
even an Emerald Congalala!

165
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,041
According to this Monsterpedia,

166
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:29,291
an Emerald Congalala's
farts are even stinkier

167
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,708
than a regular
Congalala's farts?

168
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,833
I don't wanna smell any
of their farts ever again.

169
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,458
Ugh! Awful!

170
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,958
What? They can't be that bad.

171
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,833
This might sound weird, but I
wanna smell them for myself.

172
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,333
You don't have to be
that curious, Lilia.

173
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,458
You need a strong will
for that challenge!

174
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,666
Can't we sneak by?

175
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,375
It worked out fine
with the Gypceros.

176

Yeah!

Oh, no. Navirou doesn't
see a way out, Lute.

But maybe it's for the best

with all the running we've
done today. Let's do it.

[NAVIROU] Onward,

226

Huh? What?

227

[LILIA]
Is this it?

228
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,583
[SIMONE] It's the spot on
the map, no doubt about it.

229
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,208
[NAVIROU]
So this is Redan's village?

230
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,916
Wow. Redan's a lot poorer
than Navirou thought.

231
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,583
His village is falling apart!

232

[SIMONE] You're only
looking at what's left

of his village, Navirou.

Now it's nothing more
than ancient ruins.

235

[LILIA]
Get it, Navi?

236
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,958
[NAVIROU] It's a ghost town.
There's nothing here.

00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:45,208
Wait. There's gotta
be something!

Hmm. Nope.

the village is that way!

247
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,666
This is no ordinary rock.

What do ya mean?

[NAVIROU grunts]

250
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,541
Whoa! What's that?

251
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,333
[LUTE]
The Mural of Redan.

252
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,333
Navi. You found something!

253
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:33,833
That's right!

254
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,708
The mystery's as good as solved
when Navirou's your guide!

255
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,625
All right, what's
it say, Navirou?

256
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:40,625
That's a mystery.

257
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,375
Ah! Why am I not surprised?

258
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,750
Look closer at the center.

259
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,000
It's the legend!

260
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,541
[SIMONE] "In the beginning
was the Awakening.

261
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,541
When an ebon darkness
is born upon the Earth,

262
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:58,416
a dragon white will come forth
at the base of a great tree."

263
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,250
[NAVIROU]
Hm? Hey, that--

264
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,125
That's what the
Guild Master told us.

265
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,458
[SIMONE]
"Two Kinships, joined together.

266

The Hunter becomes the Rider.

267
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,291
When there is Kinship,
there is light.

268
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,500
When there is no Kinship,
there is darkness."

00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:18,208
[SIMONE] "The Black Dread,
born of the darkness,

270

will stain both heaven
and earth as blackest jet.

271
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:25,791
It is then we seek him. He comes
astride a dragon white,

272
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:29,500
soaring gallantly
across the heavens.

273
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,375
He shall pierce
the ebon darkness,

274
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:35,041
and thus reclaim the light.
For this is Redan,

275
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,916
he who has formed
Kinship with monsters."

276
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,666
This "Black Dread" it mentions,
what does that mean?

277
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,791
So this is saying that Redan
actually was a Rider after all.

278
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,791
No, it's the opposite.

279
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,958
"The Hunter becomes the Rider."

280
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,041
Redan started as a Hunter.

281
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,666
What? Redan was a Hunter?

282
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,916
I'm not sure which he was.

283
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,875
So wait, what about this part?

284
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,875
"When an ebon darkness
is born on the Earth."

285
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,875
That sounds like what's
happening right now,

286
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,208
with the Black Blight
spreading everywhere.

287
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,791
Which then means,

288
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,500
"the dragon white coming forth
at the base of the great tree"

289
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,208
has already happened?

290
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,166
Great tree. Hm...

291
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,958
This must be it! Come on!

292
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:27,250
Incredible. I could spend
all day on this mural.

293
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,375
But yes, we should
keep moving forward.

294
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:35,958
[LUTE] Wow! The great tree
definitely lives up to its name!

295
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,291
It's huge!

296

wanna climb up there!

don't have much of a choice.

over them this time.

get farted on way up there!

Wow, Navi, that's great.

313
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:32,541
When did you get so
knowledgeable about monsters?

314
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,791
Navirou's had some
impressive personal growth.

315

Hey, there. Can ya
step aside for a bit?

316
