1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,416
[NARRATOR]
These youngsters are Riders,

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,875
on a quest to track down
blackened Kinship Ore

3
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:15,708
and stop the Black Blight that's
been spreading across the world.

4
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:18,916
So how was the
Tower of Illusion?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,916
From the look on your face,
I assume it went well.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,750
Impressive, isn't it?

7
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,791
This is the suit of
armor your father wore

8
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,333
when he was about your age.

9
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,875
From my dad?

10
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,666
[NARRATOR]
Now wearing his father's armor,

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,541
Lute headed off to slay monsters
stricken with the Black Blight.

12
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:42,500
I will stop the Black Blight,
thanks to my Kinship with Ratha!

13
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:45,250
[NARRATOR] Lute's faith in that
Kinship gave rise to a powerful,

14
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:48,125
brand-new Kinship Attack.

15
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,416
Meanwhile...

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,625
Forget it! I don't believe
in any Kinship!

17
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:55,958
Rathian, I have no
more use for you!

18
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,666
[NARRATOR]
Cheval dismissed Rathi,

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,500
the Monstie who had been
his constant companion.

20
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:01,375
And then...

21
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,375
The both of you are useless.

22
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:04,458
[BOTH gasp]

23
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:10,083
You won't betray me.
I'm sure of it.

24
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,666
I hope you hatch soon.

25
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,500
[NARRATOR] With Cheval
more alone than ever,

26
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,708
and Lute off fighting
to end the Black Blight

27
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:20,458
using the power of Kinship,

28
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:25,166
who should sneak back onto the
scene but Dr. Manelger.

29
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,458
[DR. MANELGER] Sorry to keep
you waiting, Cheval, my boy!

30
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:32,416
But at last, it's ready,
my Mecha Kinship Stone!

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,833
Uh, Cheval, my boy?

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,166
[LUTE]
Hey, Navirou,

33
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,666
Lilia's got a lead on
a Kinship Ore for us.

34
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,375
Let's get to Mount
Rhyz right away.

35
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:44,791
Navirou's good to go!
Already packed and everything!

36
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,875
Seriously? That's
nothing but donuts!

37
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,291
All right, let's see.

38
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,916
If we're over this lake,
then I'm pretty sure Mount Rhyz

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,416
is gonna be somewhere off
to the east of us now.

40
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,083
Navirou's navigation
won't steer us wrong!

41
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,541
Okay, here goes! This Mount
Rhyz we're looking for is...

42
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,333
[BOTH]
It's that way!

43
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,833
[NAVIROU]
Oh, c'mon, Ratha!

44
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:09,500
Y'know, just once you could
follow Navirou's directions!

45
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,166
[ITSY-BITS]
Sir! Sir!

46
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,541
I think I may have figured out
where Cheval's run off to.

47
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,583
There's a better than good
chance he's at Mount Rhyz!

48
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,291
And why would he be there?

49
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,750
Well, according to one of
my very reliable sources,

50
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,958
the Scriveners think that there
may be another Kinship Ore

51
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,750
located somewhere
on the mountain.

52
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,125
So I'm thinking if it's already
been Blighted, then that would--

53
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,208
Then that would mean that

54
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,791
the local monsters
would be Blighted,

55
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,541
which would mean that
Cheval would undoubtedly

56
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,416
be making an appearance there,
sooner rather than later!

57
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,291
That's right! He has to!

58
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,541
For the moment, at least,

59
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,291
Cheval has devoted his
life to tracking down

60
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,208
and slaying Blighted monsters!

61
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,583
So what are we waiting for?

62
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,875
Let's hurry up and make our
way to Mount Rhyz, sir!

63
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,958
[NAVIROU]
There it is, Mount Rhyz!

64
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,958
So we're supposed to
find a Kinship Ore

65
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,708
somewhere down there?

66
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,875
[LUTE] Wow, this mountain
is absolutely huge.

67
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,791
It's gonna take days
for the two of us

68
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,875
to scour this place
by ourselves.

69
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,500
That's for sure. Too bad
the Numbers aren't here.

70
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,916
We could split up and search
in a fraction of the time.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,041
Navirou wonders how those
guys are doing, anyway.

72
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,208
Hope they're good!

73
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,791
[BEATS] Yeah, totally!
We're doin' great!

74
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,333
Ah, what a relief to
hear you're doing fine!

75
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,375
That's good to kn-- Oh?

76
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,416
[gasps]

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,250
[BOTH]
Uh?

78
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,666
[BOTH]
Whoa!

79
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,750
Nothing in the world burns
brighter than my spirit!

80
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,625
Number One.

81
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,666
Beats!

82
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,250
I am of warm heart,
but cool breath.

83
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,208
Number Two.

84
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,000
I am Cryo!

85
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,875
Sparkle-sparkle!

86
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:49,000
My dazzling beauty is
almost blindingly bright!

87
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,958
Number Three.

88
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,541
Fifi here!

89
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:57,250
You don't need glasses to
see I'm the brains here.

90
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,375
Number Four.

91
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:02,416
You can call me Spex!

92
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,000
Leading you onward to
a brighter tomorrow!

93
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,375
Number Five.

94
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,083
Navirou!

95
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:14,541
Always time for a nap!
Number Six!

96
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,791
Wook, it's me, Floof!

97
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,666
And all together, we are:

98
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,666
[ALL]
The Numbers!

99
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,000
Hey, long time no see, guys!

100
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,958
But what the heck are you
doing all the way out here?

101
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:31,416
Well, after we last saw
you on Naubaka Island,

102
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,500
we got to talkin' about
what we could do to help.

103
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,916
Yes, precisely.

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,666
Nobody should ever have
to go through what we did.

105
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,166
We decided that meant we
had to try and put a stop

106
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,958
to Dr. Manelger's
latest maniacal scheme.

107
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,958
Oh, great, what's he up to now?

108
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,208
We don't know the specifics,
but whatever he's plotting,

109
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,833
we do know he'd sacrifice anyone
for the sake of his research!

110
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,708
And from what we've heard,

111
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,583
he's already gone and
successfully nabbed

112
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,333
the legendary white dragon egg!

113
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,916
We've been secretly
tailing him,

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,458
which is how we've come to find
ourselves here at Mount Rhyz.

115
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,958
But then wight
after we got here,

116
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,583
we wost twack of Dr. Manelger
while I was yawning

117
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,875
and now we can't
find him anywhere.

118
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:12,500
Ooh, I know, maybe I can twy
to wook for him in my dweams.

119
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,583
Nighty-night.

120
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,041
Hang on a second,

121
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,583
did you just say you tracked
Manelger to this mountain?

122
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,083
Hey, that works out perfectly!

123
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,500
Now we can join forces and
help you guys look for Manelger

124
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,208
while you help us hunt
for the Kinship Ore!

125
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,750
Makes sense we'd wind up
in the same place eventually.

126
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,333
Even when we're apart,
we're still one, am I right?

127
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,416
That you are!

128
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,833
All right, then!

129
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,708
The Numbers are back in
business and ready for action!

130
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,916
Let's track down Manelger

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and take back that white
dragon egg together!

132
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,083
Whadda ya say?

133
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,750
[OTHERS]
Yeah!

134
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,583
And we'll keep the Kinship
Ore safe while we're at it!

135
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,000
[ALL]
Yeah!

136
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,500
[LUTE]
Wait, what?

137
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,333
Why are we stopping to
eat all of the sudden?

138
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,708
We were so pumped up and ready
for action just a second ago!

139
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,416
But first, we eat!

140
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,500
And...

141
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,750
[NUMBERS]
...that's a Numbers rule.

142
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,083
[LUTE chuckles]

143
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,416
Aw, but, Lutie Pie,

144
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,791
you must be at least
a little hungry by now.

145
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:05,791
[LUTE chuckles nervously]

146
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,000
"Lutie Pie"?
Just "Lute" is fine.

147
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,458
Oh? Okay.

148
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:13,333
Here you go, this dewicious
one's just for you!

149
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,083
Thanks! Looks yummy!

150
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,333
You know, if it's too hot,

151
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,416
I'd be more than happy
to blow on it for you.

152
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,250
Uh, that's okay.
I think I'm all good.

153
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,958
Been so long since we've sat
down and eaten together.

154
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,083
Yes, but still,
we mustn't forget,

155
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,541
this meal is all about giving
us the energy we'll need

156
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,250
to stand up to Manelger.

157
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,791
Oh, c'mon, there's no reason
to bring that up now.

158
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,833
For the moment, let's
just eat up and enjoy.

159
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:38,166
[FIFI] Cryo, want me to blow on
that for you and cool it off?

160
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,083
Uh, no thank you, I'll pass.

161
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:43,166
After all, I'm a lot better
at it than you are.

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,166
You see?

163
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,625
[CHEVAL]
Pathetic.

164
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,041
[CHEVAL]
I have no use for a Monstie

165
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,625
that can't slay a
Blighted monster.

166
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,166
Guess I'll just move
on to the next one.

167
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,416
[ITSY-BITS]
I'm all finished, sir!

168
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,666
Ah, so I see,

169
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,875
and what a marvelous job
you've done, Itsy-Bits.

170
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,125
Wow, thanks for saying
that, sir! It means a lot!

171
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,916
Anyway, I made these
little masterpieces

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,416
exactly like you instructed.

173
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,958
So we're prepared now,

174
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,541
and no matter who tries to come
after the white dragon egg,

175
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,916
they won't be able to pick out
the real one from the forgeries!

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,875
It's brilliant!

177
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,666
Yes, and once we locate Cheval,

178
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,000
we can upgrade his Kinship
Stone by combining it

179
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:35,625
with this Mecha Kinship Stone
that I so cleverly created.

180
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,375
And then that great white
dragon will finally be ours!

181
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,000
[ITSY-BITS]
Oh, look, sir! There it is!

182
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,375
Mount Rhyz!

183
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:46,166
But, huh, I'm not seeing any
black haze down there.

184
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,666
Well, that does us no good.

185
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,583
Cheval will only show up if
there's a Blighted monster.

186
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,833
It appears we're
wasting our time here.

187
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,791
But wait! Is that Lute
I spy with my little eye?

188
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,083
[ITSY-BITS]
And the Numbers, too!

189
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,333
Oh, no, sir!
What should we do now?

190
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,416
Time for a slight
change of plans.

191
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,791
Ride On!

192
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,458
Rathalos!

193
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,708
Rub-a-dub-dub,
thanks for the grub!

194
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,666
[LUTE]
Ah, what a feast!

195
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,625
That sure hit the
spot, all right!

196
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,125
Now let's go find
that Kinship Ore!

197
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,166
[OTHERS]
Yeah!

198
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,041
Whoa, what the heck is that?

199
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,250
[NAVIROU]
Hm?

200
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,541
[ITSY-BITS]
Yoo-hoo, you guys!

201
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,041
How's it goin', everyone?

202
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,875
It's Manelger!

203
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,000
Ah, Lute, my dear boy!
We meet again!

204
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,666
What do you what, Manelger?

205
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,875
Huh?

206
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,666
I wasn't expecting you
to hitch your wagon

207
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,041
to these Felyne failures.

208
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,125
[ALL growl]

209
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,083
Whoa, whoa, there's
no need to get upset

210
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,250
and make those
scary faces at us!

211
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,500
Right, sir?

212
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,166
We don't want to fight
with you. But that all--

213
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,500
That all depends on how you
choose to respond here, Lute!

214
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,666
Oh, come on! That was supposed
to be my big tough-guy line!

215
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,166
What do you want?

216
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,541
Why, the good doctor here
is generously offering you

217
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,000
another chance to join us.

218
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,541
Here's an offer for you!

219
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,500
How about giving back that white
dragon egg you guys stole?

220
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,083
[OTHERS] That's right!
Give it back, you egg thieves!

221
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,416
Oh, but of course!

222
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,041
If young Lute here agrees
to cooperate with us,

223
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,208
then we'd be more than
happy to give back the egg.

224
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,750
So what do you say, my boy?

225
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,833
I'll never help you.

226
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,000
But I will get that egg back!

227
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,166
[DR. MANELGER] Well then,
it seems I have no choice

228
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,458
in the matter.

229
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:38,041
I suppose I'll just have
to use Cheval after all.

230
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,083
You stay away from Cheval!

231
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,125
Yes, well, unlike you,
my simple little friend,

232
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,583
that Cheval has got
what it takes up here.

233
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:45,666
What?

234
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,208
He's not wrong.
Sorry, but it's true.

235
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,833
I'm confident Cheval
will be making

236
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:54,708
that white dragon his
Monstie in no time.

237
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,791
With a little help from this.

238
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,416
[LUTE]
What's that?

239
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,750
[DR. MANELGER]
Oh, ho! Intrigued, are we?

240
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:05,666
This is my Mecha Kinship Stone,
or "Mechinship Stone" for short.

241
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,666
[ITSY-BITS] We already tried
to hatch the egg with Cheval

242
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,750
using his Kinship
Stone on its own,

243
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,833
but that wasn't enough
to do the trick.

244
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,541
So we came up with this.

245
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,541
[gasps] Wait, Cheval?

246
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,875
Unfortunately, the Kinship
Stones that you Riders possess,

247
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,333
at least on their own,

248
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,875
lack the necessary power to
hatch that particular egg.

249
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,125
Howev--

250
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,750
However, by installing
this Mechinship Stone,

251
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,291
it'll boost the power of your
regular old Kinship Stone

252
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,666
to incredible new
levels of awesomeness!

253
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,625
Which means,
with this baby here,

254
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,250
you can now form Kinship
with that white dragon,

255
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,291
and when you do,
then you can rise up

256
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,333
and be the next
Redan of legend!

257
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:42,250
You stole my line again,
just as I was about to say it!

258
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,208
That's the second time today!

259
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,916
[LUTE]
The next Redan?

260
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,125
Lute, my boy, this is your final
chance, and your last warning.

261
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:55,000
So tell me, will
you join us or not?

262
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,583
No, never!

263
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,083
Very well then.

264
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:01,250
Sounds like you won't be
budging from that position.

265
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,333
My, how unfortunate for you.

266
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,583
[BEATS]
You're the unfortunate one!

267
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:06,458
[DR. MANELGER]
Huh?

268
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:07,875
See this?

269
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,458
We managed to get our paws
on your white dragon egg!

270
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,500
Ha.

271
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,791
It was pretty sloppy
of you fellas

272
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,875
to just leave it
unattended like that.

273
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,125
Without this egg,

274
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,000
that Mechinship Stone is
just some gaudy jewelry

275
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,541
that's purely for decoration!

276
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,125
Ha! Serves you right!

277
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,708
Yeah, game over,
ya big meanie!

00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,750
Oh, wow, awesome job, you guys!

279
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,958
That's Navirou's pals
for you, all right!

280
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,666
[ITSY-BITS laughs]

281
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,000
They fell for it, sir,
hook, like, and sinker!

282
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:34,958
What now?

283
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,375
What's that mean?

284
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,750
See, the real egg was
right here the whole time!

285
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,541
[ALL]
Huh?

286
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,208
So wait, you mean
this one is fake?

287
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,291
It's bogus? That's
no fair, you cheaters!

288
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,125
When carrying such
precious cargo,

289
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,958
it's only natural to anticipate
all manner of skullduggery

290
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,208
that may arise and take
every precaution necessary

291
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,708
to guard against it!

292
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,791
Ha! Looks like you're
the sloppy ones here!

293
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:02,750

00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,041

Take it, Floof!

305
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,916
[NAVIROU]
Hey, Floof! Over here!

306
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,375
What a catch!

307
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,666
Well, will you look at that?

308
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,916
Our stellar teamwork,

309
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,708
under the leadership of
yours truly, of course,

310
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,666
managed to get us back
the white dragon egg!

311
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,250
Talk about your Kinship
plays, huh, Lute?

312
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,208
That's right! Too bad for you!

313

that there was a Kinship Ore

"In the direction of the

Actually, my simple friends,

378
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,083
if you take a close
look at an egg,

379
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:22,291
its shell is completely covered
in tiny little bumps.

380
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,166
And there's a position in
which you can place it

00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,875
where those bumps
line up just right

with the egg's
center of gravity.

383
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,666
In fact, all it takes
is three such bumps

384
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,083
to act like a sort of tripod,

385
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,541

allowing it to stand upright.

Meanwhile, we'll
keep our sights set

471
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,500
on those delinquents for you,
whatever they may be up to.

472
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,708
I'll twy my vewy best,
even when I feel sweepy.

473
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,583
You guys.

474
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,583
Nothing in the world burns
brighter than my spirit!

475
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,500
Number One.

476
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,666
Beats!

477
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,958
I am of warm heart,
but cool breath.

478
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,166
Number Two.

479
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,875
I am Cryo!

480
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,750
Sparkle-sparkle!

481
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,875
My dazzling beauty is
almost blindingly bright!

482
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,916
Number Three.

483
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,500
Fifi here!

484
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:24,208
You don't need glasses to
see I'm the brains here.

Number Four.

00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,375
You can call me Spex!

00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,916
Leading you onward to
a brighter tomorrow!

488

Number Five.

Hey, wait, what about me?

495
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,375
If you insist.

496
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:55,750
And here's Lute, I guess!

497
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,666
"I guess?" What's
that supposed mean?

498

[ITSY-BITS]
A thousand apologies, sir.

499
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:06,041
To think, all that trouble
because I was too darn talented.

500
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,000
But I've finally figured
out which egg's real!

501

[DR. MANELGER]
Enough of this confusion.

502
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,500
Lose the other two!

503
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,916
You should know by now
I'm only interested in results.

504
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,333
Cheval wasn't on the mountain
and that's all there is to it.

505
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:19,458
We failed today.

506
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:20,708
Yes.

507
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,666
But next time, we will
find Cheval, for sure.

508
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,000
I have no doubt about it.

<i>Monstie Manual</i> !

510
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,458
Here comes the part
where Navirou

511
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,041
tells you about Monsties.

512
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,000
All right, Navirou
hopes you have

513
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,208
your Media Trigger
Smart Phone app open.

514
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,625
Better get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

515
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:51,833
And now, it's time to form
a Kinship with our Monsties!

00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,916
The moment of new life!

[NAVIROU] Our Monstie this
time is: Great Baggi!

519
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,375
A real brainy beast,
with sharp looks, to boot!

520
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:06,875
Leading packs of Baggi
is what it does best.

521
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,583
It can also put
its foes to sleep

522
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,875
with a special liquid
before doing them in!

523
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:13,833
Wonder how that compares
to Floof's yawns.

524
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:17,000
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!
