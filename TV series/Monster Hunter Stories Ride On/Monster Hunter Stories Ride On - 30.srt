00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,791
[NARRATOR]
These youngsters are Riders,

2
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:12,333
on a Quest to track down
blackened Kinship Ore

3
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:17,583
and stop the Black Blight that's
been spreading across the world.

4
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:20,416
Along the way, Lute and
Navirou came across Debli

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,750
selling imitation
Kinship Stones,

6
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:25,791
and together, they ventured into
the mine where he'd found them.

7
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,875
Alas, awaiting them there were
the monster-mechanizing

8
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:33,833
Dr. Manelger and his loyal
assistant Itsy-Bits.

9
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,208
Soon, they learned that
in addition to monsters,

10
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:39,500
Manelger had been
modifying Felynes as well.

11
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,208
With the help of
some old friends,

12
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,375
Navirou regained the
memories that he had lost

13
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:47,416
and recalled that once,
he too had been modifed.

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,958
Lute and the others
had finally managed

15
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,583
to escape the dastardly duo,

16
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:54,208
when they noticed that
Ratha was acting strangely.

17
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,000
At that moment, Avinia appeared

18
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,750
and told them that Ratha
had been stricken

19
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,791
with the Black Blight.

20
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:04,875
Still, Lute maintained
faith in their Kinship.

21
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:08,208
Just then, who should swoop
in out of nowhere but--

22
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:11,500
Your Rathalos has been
afflicted with the Blight.

23
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,541
It must be destroyed!

24
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,791
Cheval, no.

25
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,291
[NAVIROU]
Is that really Cheval?

26
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,083
He is standing on Rathi, but--

27
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:21,166
[DEBLI]
Yeah, what's with all

28
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,375
the Azure Rathalos
gear he's wearing?

29
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,208
How'd he get his hands on that?

30
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:29,041
Don't tell us you've joined
forces with Manelger!

31
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:31,791
I joined forces with no one.

32
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:34,208
Wow, he even sounds tougher.

33
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:36,833
I'm not the boy I used to be.

34
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,708
Cheval...

35
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:41,208
Lute. Hand over that Rathalos.

36
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:45,000
Don't try to resist,
or I'll have to hurt you.

37
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,666
Is that how it is? You mean it?

38
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,166
Blighted monsters
must be defeated.

39
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,500
Every one of them.

40
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,625
Ratha is gonna be fine!

41
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,916
I'll get him back to
normal in no time.

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,541
No use.

43
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,916
There's only one way to stop the
Blight, and that's to slay him.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,291
Well, I'll stop it!

45
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,625
I speak now as a Rider

46
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:08,166
who slayed an Azure
Rathalos for this armor.

47
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,916
I've seen a lot since that day.

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,041
The day I decided to
walk a different path.

49
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:21,750
[PEOPLE screaming]

50
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,083
[CHEVAL]
It was horrible.

51
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,041
So much more of the
world had been stricken

52
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,208
with the Black Blight than
I ever could've imagined.

53
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,208
[CHEVAL]
I saw Hunters fight desperately

54
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,708
to slay the Blighted monsters.

55
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,958
[CHEVAL]
To keep the people safe.

56
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,708
[CHEVAL]
That's when it hit me.

57
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,375
[CHEVAL]
All this time,

58
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,291
what have we been
doing with ourselves?

59
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,833
[MILLE]
Cheval.

60
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,833
[HYORO] But Riders... we're
the only ones who can Ride On.

61
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,291
It's what we do.

62
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,750
[CHEVAL] And yet we
couldn't protect them.

63
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:18,708
Not Hakum Village.
And not my mom.

64
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:24,500
[CHEVAL] Ever since then, I'd
been wondering why that was.

65
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,541
[CHEVAL]
Then I understood.

66
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:57,041
Merely protecting
people isn't enough.

67
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,375
[MILLE] That's right.
We have to slay the monsters!

68
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:02,125
[HYORO]
Yeah. Let's wipe 'em out.

69
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,541
[CHEVAL]
Since that realization,

70
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:09,833
we've taken on Quests
like the Hunters do,

71
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,375
slaying Blighted monsters.

72
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,291
[yells]

73
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:24,083
[CHEVAL] We're just as
strong as any Hunters.

74
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:29,750
That's what we learned...
when we slayed this Rathalos.

75
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,416
[roars]

76
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:38,666
[CHEVAL] Well, that's an Azure
Rathalos for you. And yet--

77
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,125
[yells]

78
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,541
Stay strong, Rathian!

79
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,458
I can't afford to
lose this battle!

80
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,166
So let's go!

81
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,583
Time to unleash
the Scorching Slice!

82
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,291
We're not just some
monster keepers anymore!

83
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,625
We're the chosen ones.

84
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,041
We'll save the world by
slaying Blighted monsters.

85
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,916
[CHEVAL] This equipment
is proof of our might,

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,708
and how far we've come.

87
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,375
Wow, it sounds like they
really did go through a lot.

88
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,083
The look in their
eyes is different.

89
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,291
Yeah, but we're Riders!

90
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,250
Cheval, Mille, and Hyoro, too.

91
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,708
All of us are Riders!

92
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,291
Oh, we're Riders, all right.

93
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,541
But the Rider I've become

94
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,125
is nothing like the ones
you're thinking about.

95
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,875
[gasps]

96
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,750
It's the same.

97
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,791
Riders are all people who
form Kinship with Monsties!

98
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,541
And that's enough to
keep everyone safe?

99
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,208
What if Ratha--?
That Rathalos there.

100
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:04,166
What if it ran amok
and attacked a village?

101
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,666
That's right, Lute.
What would you do then?

102
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,416
Could you stop him?

103
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,791
Stop and protect!

104
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,166
Protect it, you mean.

105
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,541
And the villagers!

106
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,166
Both of them!

107
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,083
It's pointless for us
to keep talking.

108
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,833
Raise your sword, Lute.

109
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,916
The days of us joining
hands are over.

110
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,875
This is the end.

111
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:39,875
Whoa!

112
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,041
Oh, this ain't good!

113
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,375
I won't part ways with you.

114
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,458
We're family, Cheval!

115
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,416
[AVINIA]
This precious sword I'm holding

116
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,375
has been handed down in
my village for generations.

117
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:09,375
But it's rusty now, thanks to
the Black Blight's influence.

118
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,333
It'll never be like it once was.

119
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:18,333
As my village will
never be the same again.

120
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:21,083
But still, my Kinship
with Frostfang,

121
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,583
it's managed to imbue within
this sword the tiniest light.

122
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,250
[BOTH gasp]

123
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,833
[AVINIA]
Back when I lost my village,

124
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,458
I took this sword as a reminder,

125
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,000
so I wouldn't forget
my resentment.

126
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:42,500
But these days, I carry
it as a warning.

127
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,333
About what?

128
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,416
We humans can be
foolish sometimes.

129
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,500
[AVINIA] There had been
outbreaks of the Black Blight

130
00:09:53,583 --> 00:10:00,958
here and there for so long,
yet we ignored the changes.

131
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:05,666
The Black Blight spread because
we cared only about ourselves,

132
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,833
and paid no attention
to our surroundings.

133
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,250
True enough,
but back in my town,

134
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,458
everyone's working together
as hard as they can

135
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,541
to put our lives back to normal.

136
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,250
Of course.

137
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:29,125
In times like these,
humans also help one another.

138
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,833
And the Kinship
with our Monsties--

139
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,083
If you have that Kinship,

140
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,666
then I believe the Black
Blight can be halted,

141
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,625
even in those Blighted monsters,

142
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:41,458
who are far more powerful than
we humans could ever be.

143
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,750
You get it, don't you, Lute?

144
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,500
I do. I know I can
stop Ratha's Blight.

145
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,458
Navirou believes in you!

146
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,541
Then use your strength
and prove it.

147
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,833
Let's see if you can stop us.

148
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:02,791
To inspire you, I'll deal
that beast its final blow.

149
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:05,750
Cheval, stop!

150
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,041
[yells]

151
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,125
Oh, Lute!

152
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,666
This just got really real!

153
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,750
Hold it right there!

154
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,875
Lilia filled us in.

155
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,333
Enough of this nonsense!

156
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,625
Why are you two at
each others' throats?

157
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,041
You're supposed to be friends.

158
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,583
I'm sorry, Stone, but--

159
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,125
Big brother.

160
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,291
This isn't the time

00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:29,125
It involves one of that mad
scientist's mecha-monsters.

324
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,250
A mecha-monster.

325

[NAVIROU]
<i>Monstie Manual</i> !

326
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,333
Here comes the part
where Navirou

327
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:39,875
tells you about Monsties!

328
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,833
All right, Navirou
hopes you have

329
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,041
your Media Trigger
Smart Phone app open.

330
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,458
And get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

331
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:51,666
And now, it's time to form
a Kinship with our Monsties!

332
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,750
The moment of new life!

333
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:56,041
Awaken!

334
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:02,708
[NAVIROU] Our Monstie
this time is: Gravios!

335
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:06,291
Its solid, stable stance makes
it a perfect fit for Stone!

336
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:09,916
It can even wade into lava
thanks to its super-thick shell!

337
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,791
And that Magma Surge Kinship
Attack sure packed a punch!

338
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:18,041
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!

339

[LUTE]
Hey, Lute here!

340
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:23,041
Rumor has it they show up
deep in the Dovan Volcano.

341
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:27,500
And who might "they"
be? That's right, ghosts!

342
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:30,458
Next time: "Be the
Forest, Be the Beast"!

343
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,833
Ride On!
