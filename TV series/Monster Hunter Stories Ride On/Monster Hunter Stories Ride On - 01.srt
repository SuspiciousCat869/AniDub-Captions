You were the one who was all
like, "It's an egg! An egg!"

[NAVIROU] So? Don't take
it out of the nest!

so they could at least
thank us for rescuing them.

00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,375
[BOTH] That was in no
way my fault at all!

They're two of
a kind, all right.

[NAVIROU]
Egg, where are you?

33
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,458
I feel it.

34
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,708
There's an egg around
here somewhere!

35
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:54,500
Oh, come on.

36
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:55,750
You say that every day,

37
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,000
but you still haven't
found a single one yet.

38
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,375
Yeah, that's true,

39
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,291
but it's not like you've
been right either, Navirou.

00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,666
[NAVIROU yelps]

41
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,208
Hey, Lute, you do know

42
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,250
you don't have to worry about
finding an egg on your own.

43
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,458
You can just get one from
Chief Omna at tomorrow's Rite,

44
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,875
like everybody else.

45
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,791
There's no need to go to
extremes searching like this.

46
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:17,250
Well, yeah, I know, but...

47
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:21,208
I just.... I wanna be the
one to find it by myself.

48
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,750
I mean, it's the first...

49
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:31,333
...the first Monstie Egg I'll
form Kinship with as a Rider!

50
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,583
We know.

51
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,541
You've been saying that
for a while now.

52
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,916
Well, I guess we can
look a little longer.

53
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,333
Thanks, guys.

54
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:48,125
[DAN] How's everybody
doing this beautiful day?

55
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,083
Now then, being a
Rider is all about

56
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,166
the Kinship with your monster.

57
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,708
You'll begin by forming Kinship
with a companion monster

58
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,375
who will eventually
become your Monstie.

59
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,916
And the first step
in that process

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,416
is hatching a monster egg.

61
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,625
To do that, you're
gonna need this.

62
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,833
It's a Kinship Stone.

63
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,458
A Rider only receives one
of these precious stones

64
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:13,041
during the course of
his or her lifetime.

65
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,208
So after Chief Omna
gives you yours tomorrow,

66
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:18,250
be sure to keep it on you
at all times, is that clear?

67
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,125
[ALL]

00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,541
Yes? What's wrong?

70
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,500
Well, this isn't all of
the Rider candidates

71
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,958
who will be in tomorrow's Rite.

72

around here somewhere!"

00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,708
That's what you
always say, correct?

00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,041
But then it never
turns out to be true!

Oh, it's here, all right!

Nitroshrooms! We'll be
all set with these!

Great, she found Nitroshrooms.

97
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,083
[CHEVAL] What could she
possibly have up her sleeve?

Ah! Nitroshrooms?

99
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,833
That must mean she's
making the, uh, you know,

100
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,166
that thing that she makes.

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,375
The, uh...

102

How can you just stand there
chowing down on a donut

when I'm over here starving?

104
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,166
Oh, come on, you know
Navirou's special donuts

105
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,041
are for Navirou only!

But...

107
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,000
If you happen to stumble across
anything delicious out here,

108

No, it's not that,
it's just I--

You're supposed
to become a Rider,

when you're such a scaredy-cat?

chug this whole thing down!

the presence of an egg.

wrong, Cheval?

think we should be

farther than this.

breaking a village rule.

be worried sick about us.

Uhh. Well, yeah, I guess you
do have a pretty good point.

Those guys sure are
taking their time.

167

Usually by now
they'd have given up

and come home with their
tail between their legs.

You don't think
there's any chance

they would've been
foolish enough

to set foot in the

Well, well, Navirou
smells something!

Make no mistake. That's the
smell of a monster egg!

I do smell something here.

Maybe, but this is Navirou
we're talking about.

No way it's really an egg.

Hey, guys, is it just me,

and a lot more monstery?

00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,166
[LUTE] Yeah, and I was really
going along with it, too.

320
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,583
Oh well.

321
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,750
Looks like you do need a
real Kinship Stone after all.

322
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,166
I guess we should head
back to the village.

323
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,125
Yeah.

324
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,375
But you wait,

325
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,125
'cause I am definitely
gonna hatch this thing

326
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,958
at the Kinship Rite tomorrow!

327
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,083
Just hang in there
till then, all right!

328
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,125
After that, you get
to be my Monstie!

329
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,041
[gasps]

330
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:22,791
[ALL gasp]

331
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,125
The egg is hatching!

332
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,708
It's-- It's being born!

333
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:39,041
Oh, wow! That's a...
a Flame Wyvern!

334
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,125
Rathalos, King of the Skies!

335
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,291
But what does this mean?

336
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,916
Oh, boy! Navirou always
knew you could do it, Lute!

337
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,416
Navirou always believed in you!

338
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,000
Oh, you did? Really?

339
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,416
[NAVIROU]
That's the truth!

340
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,625
[laughs] You know what?
Right now, I don't even care!

341
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,291
[LUTE]
You hatched for me.

342
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,750
I'm grateful.

343
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:03,666
Hold on.

344
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,458
He may've hatched,

345
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,416
but you still don't have
Kinship with him yet.

346
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,875
Be careful.

347
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,833
Oh, don't worry, it's fine.
He's my Monstie after all!

348
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,458
Isn't that right, Ratha?

349
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,041
Ratha? But that's a Rathalos.

350
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:19,583
No, this guy is my Rathalos.

351
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,875
And his name's Ratha!

352
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,083
[LILIA , CHEVAL laugh]

[screams]

354
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,708
Jeez, Navirou,
do you ever give up?

355
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,125
Yeah, you're not fooling
anybody, you know.

356
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,333
No, no! For real! It's back!
It's back! This isn't a joke!

357
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:42,000
[NAVIROU screams]

358
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,208
Ya see?

359
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,208
Stay back! This is
just a hatchling!

360
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,708
[yells]

361
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,541
Uh-oh.

362
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,708
[roars]

363
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,250
Look out!

364
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:10,875
Ratha!

365
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,666
Whoa!

366
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,458
[roars]

00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:41,750
[DAN]
You all right?

368
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,500
Where'd you come from?

369
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,041
Lemme guess, you've got
a beehive on you.

370
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,083
No wonder you guys have
an Arzuros on your tail

371
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,416
carrying that around!

372
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,625
Gimme!

373
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,708
You're our hero!

374
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,166
[DAN]
Don't give me that nonsense!

375
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,958
[screams]

376
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:12,083
Hey, hold on a second.
What's with this Rathalos?

377
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,375
[GAMIGAMI]
Honestly!

378
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,875
You kids may've
gotten lucky this time,

379
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,708
but confronting an Arzuros
without a weapon or a Monstie

380
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,333
might just be the
most reckless thing

381
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,291
I've ever heard of
in my entire life!

382
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,000
Not to mention the fact
that you ventured

383
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,250
into the Forbidden Land!

384
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,125
I mean, what were you
even doing there anyway?

385
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,208
I know you were behind this,
weren't you, Lute? Admit it!

386
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,500
I thought there might
be an egg there.

387
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,250
Foolish boy!

388
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,250
Why do you always do
things like this?

389
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,500
[DAN] Gotta say,
I'm a little surprised.

390
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,833
Whoever heard of hatching an
egg without a Kinship Stone?

391
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,416
It is remarkable.

392
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,000
Perhaps this miracle
justifies and excuses

393
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,500
their little transgression.

394
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,416
You're too easy
on the boy, Chief.

395
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,750
For goodness' sake,

396
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,583
these children barely
made it back here at all!

397
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,166
I completely agree. I was
worried sick about you.

398
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,125
So don't think you can
escape my punishment.

399
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,458
Cheval, Lute, and Lilia,

400
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,250
none of you will be getting
any dessert tonight.

401
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:06,958
Aw, but, Mom.

402
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,083
You really mean that?

403
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,541
But we love the
desserts you make!

404
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,625
They're all so
incredibly delicious!

405
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,541
I'm sorry, but I was
really worried this time.

406
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,375
Sorry, Mom.

407
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,458
Yeah, sorry, Mrs. Vlau.

408
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:20,916
I'm sorry.

409
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,083
You guys better think long
and hard about what you did.

410
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,458
You, too, Navi.

411
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,416
There will be no donuts
for you tonight.

All right, everybody, remember,

tomorrow is our
great Kinship Rite.

417
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,625
I think that we should
all get some rest now.

418
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,041
Oh, hey, Chief,

419
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,666
is it okay if I take this
little fella home with me?

420
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,083
[CHIEF OMNA]
Hmm.

421
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,958
I doubt he'd leave
your side anyway.

[CHIEF OMNA] "When an ebon
darkness is born upon the Earth,

the coming of the One.

See, he comes astride
a dragon white."

Hey, Lute here!

Now that I've formed
Kinship with Ratha,

00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:38,416
I'm finally gonna be an
honest-to-goodness Rider!
