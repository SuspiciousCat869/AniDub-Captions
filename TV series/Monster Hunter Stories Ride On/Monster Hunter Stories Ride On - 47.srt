You can bring Ratha back around

by using the power
of your Kinship!

Oh, no.

How's Lute supposed to purify
Ratha without a Kinship Stone?

It's getting ready to wipe
out everything in its path!

We've got to get out of here!

I have to save Ratha!

And how are you gonna do
that with no Kinship Stone?
