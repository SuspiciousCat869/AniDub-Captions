166
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,375
But don't you remember
what Dan said?

167
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,708
The Riders' job is to be
prepared for the next attack,

168
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,291
whenever it may come!

169
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,916
And right now, our job is
to eat and get stronger.

170
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,208
But Ratha is out of
commission... and...

171
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,916
Yeah, it's the same for
most of the Riders, though.

172
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,125
I think the only Monsties
who are still up and about

173
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,875
are my Bulldrome
and Mille's Apthonos.

All the rest are recovering.

And that's why it'll be
up to us and our Monsties

to stop that thing the next time

that it tries to
attack the village!

Yeah, but that's not
gonna happen. Is it?

Hey, Cheval,

192
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,958
is it true that you made
a Rathian your Monstie.

193
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,291
Yeah. Rathi's a mighty one.

194
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:05,375
She's just a hatchling, but I
sense this awesome power.

195
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,416
With Rathi, I'm certain.

196
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,916
Wow.

197
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,833
So that gives us a total of
three functioning Monsties.

198
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,666
[CHEVAL] Yeah. I think
we can do it with three.

to you and Ratha.

You guarded our Kinship Rite,

That means it's my turn to step
up and protect the village.

You know, we are still
just apprentice Riders, guys.

I don't think that Chief Omna's
gonna let us do this.

Yeah, well, we're the only ones

[SIMONE]
The Black Blight.

215
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:59,166
I expect you're already
aware of its existence.

216
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,416
We never thought,
never even imagined,

217
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,500
that such a disaster would
come about as quickly as this.

218
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,625
It was likely something
that the Scriveners

219
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,958
could never have predicted.

220
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:14,125
That particular monster has
been officialy recognized

221
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,041
as a Blighted Nargacuga.

222
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,208
The situation is dire.

223
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,458
We'll have to slay it here.

224
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,583
Wait, slay it?

225
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,125
Monsters who've been
affected by the Black Blight

226
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,833
run amok, dangerously,
never regaining their senses.

227
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,333
Which is why I've
sent for a Hunter

228
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,625
to be dispatched
here right away.

229
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,500
But if we don't defeat it soon,

230
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,583
it will surely attack
the village again.

231
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,291
Perhaps, but as you
can see, at the moment,

232
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,125
we don't have any
functioning Monsties.

233
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,125
Not exactly. The apprentice
Riders have two.

234
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,958
And it's newly hatched,
but the Rathian--

235
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,000
That's too heavy a
burden to place on them.

236
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,416
If we use them, we can get that
beast before its wounds heal!

237
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,958
Enough!

238
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,666
We cannot task the apprentices

239

with such a great
responsibility.

Think, Chief Omna.

241
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,583
For the sake of the village,

242
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,375
we must do whatever we
can in times like these.

243
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,250
My answer is final!

244
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,333
Why, those children haven't
even been recognized

245
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,041
as full-fledged Riders yet.

246
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,875
But if we do nothing,
the village will--

247
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,500
[SIMONE] It's going to
take at least a few days

for the Hunter to arrive here.

249
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,208
We have no guarantee
that the monster

250

will behave itself
in the meantime.

to help, remember that?

I guess.

259

Right now, the Nargacuga's
probably been weakened

by Ratha's attack.

your Rathian, too.

That's where it has to be.

323
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,333
Where are we?

324
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,916
[MILLE]
It's so... creepy.

325
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,666
Whoa!

326
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,208
What's with that gigantic stone?

327
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:48,541
[NAVIROU] Hold on.
Navirou's seen this before!

328
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,833
Wait. Huh? But how
could he have seen it?

329
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,708
Yeah, and where?

330
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,875
Uh, Cheval, are you all right?

331
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,333
I know it's here.

332
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,375
That monster...

333
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:07,083
And revenge for what it did...

334
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,166
It's right here.

335
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,625
Oh, Mom. This is where I end it.

336
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,125
For you, by my own hand!

337
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,458
[LUTE]
Cheval!

338
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:29,541
[roars]

339
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:36,666
[NAVIROU]
<i>Monstie Manual</i> !

340
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,458
Here comes the
part where Navirou

341
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:39,916
teaches you about Monsties.

342
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,958
Now then, Navirou hopes you have

343
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,208
your Media Trigger Smart
Phone app open for this.

344
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,666
And get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

345
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:51,500
Now it's time to form a
Kinship with our Monsties!

346
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,666
The moment of new life!

347
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,875
Awaken!

348
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,041
[NAVIROU] Our Monstie
this time is: Rathian!

349
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:05,583
This Queen of the Land
races over the ground!

350
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:08,500
And she gets along so well
with the flying Rathalos,

351
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,375
that they often
team up together!

352
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:13,916
Hey, that's just like
Lute and Cheval!

353
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,666
Navirou can't wait to see
what monster hatches next time!

354
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,916
[LUTE]
Hey! Lute here!

355
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,791
Finally us Riders are
gonna have the chance

356
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:23,750
to show what we can do in a
battle against the Nargacuga.

357
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:27,208
I feel a lot better having
Cheval and Rathi by my side!

358
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,416
Next time:
"Face the Black Blight!"

359
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,000
Ride On!
