[LUTE, NAVIROU panting]

00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:16,583
[NARRATOR]
This young boy's name is Lute,

3
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,458
a rash but enthusiastic fellow,

4
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:21,958
who dreams of becoming
the world's top Monster Rider.

5
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:25,208
All right! It's just a little
farther so hang in there!

6
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,375
[NARRATOR]
But as you can see,

7
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,625
even his burning
passion has run dry

8
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,666
under the blazing desert sun.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,166
It's so hot. I need some water.

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,291
So hot. Navirou needs donuts.

11
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,208
Hey! Don't talk about donuts

12
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,583
while we're stuck out here
in this bone-dry desert!

13
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:45,291
That's just gonna
dry your mouth out even more!

14
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,500
Sorry, guys. I would
make you Cool Drinks

15
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,625
if I had any of
the ingredients with me.

16
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,833
[NARRATOR] Incidentally,
all of Lilia's drinks

17
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,958
are extremely bitter.

18
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,125
[LUTE, NAVIROU]
Not a problem at all!

19
00:00:56,208 --> 00:01:00,083
Uh! Look, over there!
We're saved!

20
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,583
Whoa! That must be
the Oasum camp!

21
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:06,625
Yay! Oh, boy! It's donut time!

22
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:09,333
Navirou definitely
perked up fast, didn't he?

23
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:13,125
Hey, wait a second!
What about my water?

24
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:15,125
They're too much.

25
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,750
[NARRATOR] Tsk! Forget about
donuts and water!

26
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:22,000
An unexpected ordeal awaits Lute
and his friends here in Oasum!

27
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,291
At last, the world
is about to witness

28
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,291
the dawn of a whole new age!

29
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:30,291
I'm so exicted it's
almost finished, Doctor!

30
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:31,541
[DR. MANELGER]
And when it is,

31
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:34,333
I will be the one
to usher in this new age!

32
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:38,000
[laughs intensely]

33
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,000
Donuts! Donuts!

34
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,541
There's no way
you're gonna beat me!

35
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,708
Who are you?

36
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,625
Who are we? Who are you?

37
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,250
You're gonna have to
give us your name

38
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,333
before Navirou
will tell you his!

39
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,666
Way to go, genius.
You just told him your name.

40
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,166
[yelps]

41
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,125
I'm Lute. We need to speak
with the village refugees here

42
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,333
so it's important
that we get inside.

43
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:58,791
We're already running
dangerously low on food.

44
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,500
If we let any more
people come in...

45
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,958
Sir, I've heard the quicksand
shows no signs of stopping.

46
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,875
Is it a serious problem?

47
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:10,791
Yes. It's still swallowing up
villages here and there.

48
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,875
And, uh, you are?

49
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,916
Lilia, of the Scriveners.

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,208
From Gildegaran,
I'm on an exploration quest.

51
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,916
[SOLDIER D]
Hmm.

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,625
You mean they sent
a kid like you?

53
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,666
Could you let us pass?

54
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,166
[SOLDIER D]
As you wish.

55
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,958
Thank you very much!

56
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,791
Finally Navirou
can eat those donuts!

57
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,750
That really is
all you think about.

58
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:33,833
[BOTH groan]

59
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,750
Oh! Uh, yeah,
those guys are with me,

60
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,333
so if you don't mind...

61
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,083
Well, you shoulda said so!

62
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,208
Jeez. Heh-he.

63
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,708
Mew said it.

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,083
[LUTE] Looks like
they've had a rough time.

65
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,916
Yeah. It's even worse
than what I'd imagined.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,625
But everything'll be fine
now that Navirou's here!

67
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,041
As long as he gets his donuts.

68
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:57,541
Guys, they only have limited
food supplies at this camp.

69
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,541
Even if you do
get food and water,

70
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,791
just be sure not to overindulge.

71
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,500
Ya hear that, Navirou?

72
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,041
Oh, yeah, Lute?
Well, right back at you!

73
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,625
Well, right back at you!

74
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,791
Right back at you!

75
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,041
Right back at you!

76
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,250
Right back at you!

77
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,541
Right back at you!

78
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,833
Right back at you!

79
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:17,458
Ha! Seriously, you two
never change, do you?

80
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,916
[GENTOR]
You again!

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,083
Troublemakers!

82
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,250
What now?

83
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,083
It feels like we've met before.

84
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,875
Hello, Captain Gentor!

85
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,583
Huh?

86
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,416
He's assigned
to the Hunter's Guild.

87
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,333
He serves the Guildmaster
there. Remember? Here.

88
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,000
[LUTE gasps]
Hey, what gives, buddy?

89
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,500
[GENTOR] We Hunters can handle
an exploration Quest just fine.

90
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,541
We have no need for children
like you on this mission.

91
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,333
And we can most
certainly do without

92
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,250
random Riders
popping up out of nowhere

93
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,416
to get in the way
of our work here.

94
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,750
What the heck?

95
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,416
He's not handing out
donuts anytime soon.

96
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,041
Huh. Looks like we're not
entirely welcome here.

97
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,833
It's Captain Gentor.
He doesn't approve of us Riders.

98
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,333
Hey, Cheval!

99
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,791
What took you so long?

100
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,416
We've been waiting here forever!

101
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,291
Hi, guys!

102
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,458
[LUTE, NAVIROU munching loudly]

103
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,375
[BOTH]
Seconds!

104
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,000
[BOTH]
Mmm!

105
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,500
[LUTE, NAVIROU]
Never mind.

106
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,458
Hey, Lute, I want you to meet

107
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,000
Chief Nolma
and Hunter Fahali here.

108
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:24,125
Both of them are refugees
from Albrachs Village.

109
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes, we've heard about you.

110
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,625
Chief Omna had
many nice things to say.

111
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,625
So are the Riders
a children's organization?

112
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,000
Oh, no, ma'am.
Nothing like that.

113
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,416
We have old guys,

114
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,958
and this one big Rider
who's built like a rock!

115
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,375
It's a mix.

116
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,583
I understand you've come
here on an exploration Quest.

117
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,916
Yes!

118
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,541
So, there have been
rumors of a black monster

119
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,750
roaming the desert.

120
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,875
Have you heard
anything about it?

121
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,375
[NOLMA]
Hmmm.

122
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,875
[LILIA]
Uh...

123
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,375
Our village.

124
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,458
It was attacked by the
black monster you speak of.

125
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:58,666
[CHEVAL, LUTE gasp]

126
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,708
So I guess the rumor was true.

127
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:04,458
We've seen it. In our village.

128
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,000
[LILIA] Is there anything
else you can tell me?

129
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,666
[NOLMA] It was nighttime,
and very dark,

130
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,791
so I couldn't see all that well,

131
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:15,375
but its entire body
was cloaked in a kind of haze.

132
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,041
[BOTH gasp]

133
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,333
[SOLDIER D] Captain Gentor,
was it Simone of the Scriveners

134
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,750
who sent those Riders
here to us?

135
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:29,083
Yes. Couldn't leave it alone.

136
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:33,000
Riders who supposedly form some
sort of "Kinship" with monsters?

137
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,291
And mere children at that!

138
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,833
What can they
possibly do to help us?

139
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,958
[MILLE] What's everyone's
take on what Chief Nolma

140
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,708
said earlier
about the black monster?

141
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,666
[HYORO] Well, sounds like
it's gotta be affected

142
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,750
by the Black Blight.

143
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,833
Yeah, that's for sure.

144
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,208
Based on what
we've heard, anyway.

145
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,333
In that case, we need
to find and stop this monster

146
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,875
as soon as possible.

147
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,666
Yeah. We'll defeat it.

148
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,375
[gasps]

149
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,333
[CHEVAL] It's been taken over
by the Black Blight.

150
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,791
Right.

151
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,541
Okay, but you all need to be
really careful out there.

152
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,416
We still don't know
what kind of monster it is

153
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,625
we're dealing with.

154
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,333
Well, if it's
that Nargacuga again,

155
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,625
then look out,
'cause that thing is scary!

156
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,875
Or worse. It could be something
even scarier this time.

157
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,541
You'll be all right, 'kay?

158
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,708
I'm not letting
anybody get hurt again.

159
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,458
Right.

160
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,791
[NAVIROU]
Hmm.

161
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,791
If Navirou eats
this many right now...

162
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,708
Hey, what are you doing, Navi?

163
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,416
Navirou's doing calculations
and making a plan.

164
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,416
Trying to figure out
precisely how many donuts

165
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,333
to eat at a time, and when
those times should be

166
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,125
while he's out
on this lengthy quest!

167
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,958
'Cause if he eats 'em all
at once, they'll be gone!

168
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,291
Oh, wow, Navi!

169
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,833
I'm really super impressed
with you right now!

170
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,166
Yeah, why's that?

171
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,083
Well, in the past,
you've always had the attitude,

172
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,416
"Navirou eats all of the donuts

173
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,125
because all of
the donuts are there!"

174
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,458
And then you'd just scarf 'em,

175
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,833
regardless of any
consequences that may come!

176
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:26,333
Ah! Is that a huge
compliment Navirou hears?

177
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,750
Woohoo! Yeah.

178
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,458
Navirou got a compliment!
Navirou got a compliment!

179
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,541
Navirou got a compliment!
Navirou got a compliment!

180
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,166
You know that wasn't really
a compliment, right, Navirou?

181
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:41,583
--[yelps]
--[LUTE, LILIA laughing]

182
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,625
What are you kids doing?

183
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,500
We're getting ready to head out
on our Quest, obviously.

184
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,083
Yeah, that's right!

185
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:52,208
Is it? And what exactly
can you Riders do, anyway?

186
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,583
A monster is putting
people in danger.

187
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,541
We wont let that happen.

188
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,083
[GENTOR]
Hmm.

189
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,625
[SOLDIER A]
Captain!

190
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:02,000
We received word the advance
party's under monster attack!

191
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,625
What's this?

192
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,083
[SOLDIER A] They were
investigating the quicksand

193
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,625
when a Cephadrome appeared.

194
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,875
And, it's a Blighted one!

195
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,708
So a Blighted Cephadrome
is on the loose.

196
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,583
In which case, it could
attack the village next.

197
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,791
Let's go.

198
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,416
Hold on! We have
to think about this.

199
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,708
A Cephadrome practically
swims through sand.

200
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,583
Once it dives in,
there's really no way to predict

201
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,750
where it's going
to surface again.

202
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,041
And if it's Blighted
on top of that...

203
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,916
Time for a strategy session!

204
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,083
[GENTOR] Hm! Well, you're
book-smart, I'll give you that.

205
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:36,916
But all that knowledge won't
do much good on the battlefield!

206
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,416
[gasps]

207
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,958
If you don't wanna get hurt,
you should stay right here.

208
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,125
Stock up on
anti-Cephadrome weapons!

209
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,333
And don't forget the Sonic Bomb!

210
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,791
[SOLDIER A]
Yes, sir!

211
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,916
It's time for us
to get going, too.

212
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,625
Yeah.

213
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,750
Captain, we're ready to go.

214
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,083
[GENTOR]
All right, let's move out!

215
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,750
Follow me, I'll take us there.

216

[DR. MANELGER laughing]

217
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,416
Weapons and Sonic Bombs?

218
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,083
Why, those are
nothing more than garbage!

219
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,583
Pitch in,
put trash in its place!

--Huh?
--Hey, wait.

221

Aren't those the
same guys we rescued?

222
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,166
Yeah.

223
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,750
[yelps] Suddenly Navirou's
fur is standing on end!

224
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,125
And just who
do you think you are?

225
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,541
I'm someone with 50 years

226
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,666
of monster research
under my belt!

227
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,333
And I'm going to use my big,
beautiful genius brains

228
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:31,166
to shut this Cephadrome
situation down.

We're here to save the day!

Save the day?

231

The only thing that you need

232
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,541
to defeat a monster
is a little ingenuity!

233
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,625
That requires--

234
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,958
That requires a
top-notch, genius-level

235

236

Did I get that right?

237

supposed to be my line!

We don't know when or where
that monster will show up.

On the bright side,

at least that means
he cares about us, right?

265
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,791
He has a funny way
of showing it!

266
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,250
Hey, so, Navirou,

267
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,750
why was your fur
standing on end earlier?

268
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,083
That's a mystery to Navirou.

269
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,791
But it's just a bad vibe he has.

270

Perfect! Then we'll be fine!

For some strange reason,

about this, too.

is the Blighted monster?

through all that sand!

480
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,750
Cheval somehow
managed to handle it

481
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,541
with the help
of Rathian's powers,

482
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,416
but then that thing showed up!

483
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,666
Next time:
"The Horned Wyvern's Lament"!

484
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,833
Ride On!
