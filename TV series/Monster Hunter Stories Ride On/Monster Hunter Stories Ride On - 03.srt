00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:10,208
[NARRATOR]
This young boy's name is Lute,

2
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:13,500
a rash, but enthusiastic fellow
who dreams of becoming

3
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:17,416
the world's top Monster Rider.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,833
During the Rite of Kinship,

5
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:21,125
the ceremony that would
make Lute a Rider,

6
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:24,666
a Tigrex suddenly appeared
out of nowhere.

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,791
The Riders were no match for
the beast's overwhelming power

8
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:30,958
and faced serious jeopardy.

9
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,416
Just then, Lute
and Ratha swooped

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,125
and managed to trigger
a Kinship Attack,

11
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:38,791
safely containing
the mighty Tigrex

12
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,708
and rescuing the
imperiled Riders!

13
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:45,750
All thanks to Navirou's
awesome directions!

14
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,625
[NARRATOR] But now it's out of
the frying pan and into the fire

15
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:51,750
as a lone Hunter approaches
the secret Rider enclave

16
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,958
of Hakum Village!

17
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:57,166
So that means things
are heating up?

18
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:07,375
Ahh. This view sure
is easy on the eyes.

19
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,583
[REVERTO]
You know,

20
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,250
with all this beautiful
scenery surrounding us,

21
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,750
I don't feel much like working.

22
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,250
Mew always make that
excuse, Reverto.

23
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,500
But mew need to be ready to
work every day, rain or shine!

24
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,208
Aw, lay off me.

25
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,875
Still, there's simply no denying

26
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,791
that mew are the purrfect
Hunter to handle

27
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,833
this Tigrex-hunting
Quest we're on now.

28
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:27,208
[REVERTO] Oh, so first you
slam me, then you praise me?

29
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,041
That's an elite Felyne for you!

30
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,083
[POPOLA]
Flattery will get mew nowhere.

31
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,375
[REVERTO]
Rats.

32
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,916
[LALA]
Uh?

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,791
That's the signal!

34
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:57,000
Ratha, Ride On. Yeah!

35
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,083
[horn blaring]

36
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,041
That sound means a--

37
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:05,041
Navirou! A Hunter's
coming to the village!

38
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,458
Hamburger?

39
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,458
Huh? No, not
"hamburger"! Hunter!

40
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:13,291
Oh. No, I can't
eat another bite.

41
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,125
[yelps]

42
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,875
I've always wanted to
see a Hunter in person!

43
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,458
[POPOLA]
Will mew look at that?

44
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,750
Popola had no idea there was a
village all the way meowt here!

45
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,791
[horn blaring]

46
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,375
What's that sound?

47
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,666
It sounds like they're
welcoming us into their town.

48
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,833
[horn blares]

49
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,958
Huh? A Hunter?

50
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,291
All right, don't do
anything suspicious now!

51
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,208
Just act normal, everyone!
Just act normal!

52
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,791
Uh, you're not acting
normal, Gamigami.

53
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,708
Oh.

54
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,875
A Hunter showing up
at a time like this?

55
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,375
Yeah, I doubt
it's a coincidence.

56
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,833
Hey! Hyoro, close all
the windows and doors!

57
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,916
Uh, okay!

58
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,125
Here. Two hundred zenny.

59
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,458
Thanks. And here's your ten
Herbs. Have a great day!

60
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,791
That's a Felyne!

61
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,208
Shush!

62
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,125
By the way, ma'am, has
anything meowt of the ordinary

63
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,166
happened around
these purrts lately?

64
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,750
[gasps]

65
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,416
Let's see.

66
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,916
I guess there was that Bulldrome

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,250
who trampled one of
our fields a while ago.

68
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:27,125
Aha! What a tranquil village!

69
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,458
[POPOLA]
Huh? Huh?

70
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,625
[groans]

71
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,375
Where'd that Reverto
run off to meow?

72
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:40,541
Hey, Lute! Hey, Lute!
Where are you?

73
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,291
Hey! Watch where mew're going!

74
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,541
Watch where--

75
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,000
They're called eyes, pal!
Should try 'em!

76
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,250
Popola was!

77
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,333
Uh. Wait a sec, are
mew a Felyne, too?

78
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,375
[NAVIROU]
Duh, Captain Obvious.

79
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,250
Navirou is a Felyne
among Felyne!

80
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,416
One of the few chosen
ones, in fact.

81
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,333
Popola's never seen a
Felyne like mew before!

82
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,833
Ugh.

83
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,208
Narrow-minded, aren't you?

84
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,541
Now, a poem.

85
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,166
"We are all different,
and we are all good.

86
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,708
After all, we're Felyne."
Navirou.

87
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,250
And that's what we
call a "Navi-rule."

88
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,708
No, no. Mewr face
is way too big.

89
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,958
[NAVIROU]
Hmm...

90
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,791
See? They're practically
the same size.

91
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,333
Popola's face is
not that wide!

92
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,208
Mew're moving mewr paws apurrt!

93
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:41,791
Ha! Seems you've got a big head
to go along with that big face!

94
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,208
[laughs]

95
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:46,375
Mew are so annoying,
mew Felyne wannabe!

96
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,916
Well, Navirou's off to
check out the Hunter. Ta-Ta!

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,166
Uh! Hunter? Wait up!
Popola's coming with mew!

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,875
Well, Chief Omna,
what do we do?

99
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,208
No matter what,

100
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,500
we cannot let him find out
this is a Rider village.

101
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,916
That means we have to set
this fellow free right away.

102
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,625
[LUTE]
So where's this Hunter anyway?

103
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,041
Well, he was just at our shop,

104
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,875
so he has to be passing by
here at some point, right?

105
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,083
You forget, our
rules clearly say

106
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,125
no one can know about
the Riders' existence.

107
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,750
So we can't talk to him.

108
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,541
If we don't say anything,
he won't find out anything!

109
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,833
[REVERTO]
Find out anything about what?

110
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,583
Is that?

111
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:44,708
[REVERTO sighs]

112
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,708
All right, come on out.

113
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,625
I'm talking to you two.

114
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,458
So are you actually
a real Hunter?

115
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,541
Uh. Well, yeah.

116
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,708
Though you're
makin' it sound lik

117
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,958
we're some kinda rare,
exotic creatures.

118
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,958
Sorry, but you're the first
one that I've ever seen.

119
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,000
Huh?

120
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,458
Whoa.

121
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:11,250
So then, what's your impression
of your first Hunter?

122
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,458
Well, you're smaller
than I expected.

123
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,166
Smaller, huh?

124
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,791
Uh, no, I don't mean like that.

125
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,500
It's just, y'know,

126
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,250
you guys take on monsters
with nothing but one weapon,

127
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,458
so I guess I figured
you'd be gigantic.

128
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,916
Monster-sized even!

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,625
Yeah, I thought the same thing!

130
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,958
[LUTE]
I know, right?

131
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:35,333
Sorry if I don't live up to your
mental picture of a Hunter.

132
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,625
Hey, mister. That's a
long sword, isn't it?

133
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:39,875
Yep.

134
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,041
[LUTE] So that's what you
fight monsters with!

135
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,541
[CHEVAL]
Whoa!

136
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,125
That's gotta be a
Tigrex long sword!

137
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:52,083
Oh. You kids know
about Tigrex, huh?

138
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,416
Uh, from books.

139
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,000
Gotcha.

140
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,333
Well, this sword's pretty much
the only thing I can depend on

141
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,791
when I'm on a hunt.

142
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,541
Huh.

143
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,541
You really gotta wonder
what those monsters

144
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,083
think about you Hunters.

145
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,083
[REVERTO]
Huh?

146
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,833
I mean, they don't
see you as food.

147
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,375
Hold on.

148
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,916
You're seriously thinkin' about
the monsters' feelings, son?

149
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,291
Sure, what's so
weird about that?

150
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,708
And I am not your son, okay!

151
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:20,375
Whoa! 'Kay. Then tell
me your name, kid.

152
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,125
It's Lute!

153
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,583
All right, Lute.

154
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:27,166
Well, stop callin' me "mister."
My name's Reverto.

155
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,875
Reverto.

156
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,583
[NAVIROU]
Hey!

157
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,458
Lute, did you ever
find that Hunter?

158
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,375
Yep! He's right there!

159
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,625
[NAVIROU]
Uh?

160
