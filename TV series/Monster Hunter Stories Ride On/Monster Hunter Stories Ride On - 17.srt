00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:09,583
[NARRATOR]
This young boy's name is Lute,

2
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:11,458
a rash but enthusiastic fellow,

3
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:14,916
who dreams of becoming the
world's top Monster Rider.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,083
After getting separated
from his friends,

5
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,208
Lute found the
injured girl, Avinia.

6
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,666
But now, having brought
her to a hot springs inn,

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,500
a mysterious force is
suddenly drawing near!

8
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,041
Don't worry about a thing, Lute!

9
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,750
Your mentor Navirou is
ready to lead from behind!

10
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,291
Oh, great!

11
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,875
[BOTH]
It's here!

12
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,791
Well, howdy-do, fellas?

13
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,458
[LUTE, NAVIROU scream]

14
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:48,166
[LUTE]
Who are you?

15
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:54,583
Uh, hello. So you're the
innkeeper, right? Or something?

16
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,500
The girl hurt her leg.

17
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:59,916
Do you mind if we stay
here until she's better?

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,125
Fine, but ya gotta
answer a riddle.

19
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,333
What?

20
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,458
I give you a riddle,
you give me an answer,

21
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,416
and if it's right,
you get to stay.

22
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,916
Really, that's it?

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,208
All right! I'll solve any
riddle you've got. Hit me!

24
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,250
Okay, here we go!

25
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:18,625
I got pointy ears
and a big ol' potbelly.

26
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,166
Tell me, boy, who am I?

27
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,125
It has pointy ears...

28
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,708
And a big potbelly...

29
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,083
Uhh... Well...

30
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,166
Maybe...

31
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,000
That's that. Your time's up.

32
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,416
[LUTE, NAVIROU]
What?!

33
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,750
[NAVIROU] Not fair! You gotta
give us more than that!

34
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:40,416
Hold on. I know it.

35
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,791
The answer's you, right?

36
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,166
[BOTH]
Huh?

37
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,875
[LUTE]
He has pointy ears.

38
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,000
[NAVIROU]
And a big potbelly.

39
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,541
[AVINIA]
It's not so much a riddle

40
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,625
as it is him
introducing himself.

41
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,166
That's right!

42
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,875
The answer to the riddle is me!

43
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,125
What kinda answer is that?!

44
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,416
I'm the Riddlemaster,

45
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,291
and since you're stayin'
in my hot springs,

46
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,208
I promise there'll be
plenty more to come!

47
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,375
We'll still pay
you for our stay.

48
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,541
We're sorry for
intruding like we did.

49
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,375
Well, ain't no need, missy.

50
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,750
Wow, thanks!

51
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,291
The Riddlemaster's heart
is just as big as his belly!

52
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,041
Yep, yep, yep.

53
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,166
Although, at first, you do
come across a little odd.

54
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,166
Oh, you two still pay.

55
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,458
--Uh?! That's not fair!
--We do?

56
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,541
It is too fair 'cause neither
of you solved the riddle.

57
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,916
[LUTE, NAVIROU]
Well, yeah, but so?

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,750
I can let ya stay the night,

59
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,125
but come dawn, you
gotta start working off

60
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,666
your room and board.

61
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,125
[LUTE, NAVIROU]
Aw, come on.

62
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,833
Rested and ready!

63
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,958
Hey! There you are, Cheval!

64
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,708
Lilia! Good morning.

65
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:02,791
[LILIA]
What are you doing?

66
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,708
Oh. I'm just--

67
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,916
Well, I had a hard
time sleeping,

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
so I've just been
studying the map.

69
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,041
[LILIA]
Good.

70
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm starting to worry about
Lute and Navi. Still not back.

71
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,500
[CHEVAL]
Yeah.

72
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,041
[LILIA] It was a little rude for
them to run off like that.

73
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,333
I mean, they can't expect us

74
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,583
to just camp here forever
waiting for them.

75
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,041
[CHEVAL]
You're right.

76
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,000
They can catch up with us.

77
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,500
We're headed to the same place.

78
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:33,333
Heck, knowing Lute, he might
already be at Gildegaran.

79
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,250
Good point. Okay.

80
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,583
I'll wake up Mille and
Hyoro and we'll get going.

81
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:38,875
All right.

82
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,833
[LUTE, NAVIROU scream]

83
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:50,208
Wake up! The work
day's a-startin!

84
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,083
[LUTE] How'd we even
get into this mess?

85
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,500
You couldn't answer the
easiest riddle ever, that's how.

86
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,625
If it was so easy, then why
couldn't you solve it?

87
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:00,750
It's your fault!

88
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,291
No, this is all your fault!

89
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,541
No, your fault!

90
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,666
[LUTE]
Your fault! End of story!

91
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,750
Once you're done scrubbin',

92
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,583
I want you working
on the hallway,

93
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,208
front doors, and toilet.

94
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,583
[LUTE, NAVIROU]
What?! All that stuff?!

95
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,041
[RIDDLEMASTER]
Well, sure!

96
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,958
That's the price you pay for
squattin' in a fella's inn

97
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,791
and not solvin' the
easiest riddle ever.

98
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,625
That jerk! I hate this
stupid Riddlemaster!

[BOTH groan]

101
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,666
Navirou's hungry, Lute.

102
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,333
Me too.

103
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:31,500
[AVINIA] Come to my room!
I have plenty of food there!

104
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,750
[LUTE, NAVIROU]
Avinia, is that you?

105
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,208
Of course.

106
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,958
The Riddlemaster prepared an
enormous breakfast for me

107
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,208
that I'll never be able
to finish on my own.

108
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,250
Why don't we eat it together?

109
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,416
[BOTH]
Wow, free breakfast!

110
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,666
Avinia, saves the day!

111
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:49,333
Hey, look! It finally
started snowing!

112
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,541
Yeah, but wait...

113
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,833
Should the ground
be so slippery?

114
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,000
When did we start
walking on ice?

115
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,125
Something's wrong, guys.

116
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,708
The road isn't supposed
to be frozen like this.

117
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,500
We must've taken a wrong
turn along the way.

118
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,708
All right. Well, let's all
just be extra careful.

119
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,375
Nice knowin' ya, Hyoro.

120
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:10,500
I'll be fine.
Look how careful I am--

121

[HYORO yelping]

122
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,333
Hyoro!

123
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,625
[HUNTER A]
Are you okay?

124
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:19,458
[HYORO]
Huh?

125
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,666
Are you okay?

126
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,791
You okay?

127
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:22,750
You okay?

00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,333
You okay?

129
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,458
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

130
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,250
Sorry I spilled your fish.

131
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,000
Hey, don't worry about it.

132
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,416
It's my fault for being slow
to clean up my fishing hole.

133
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,666
You're a fisherman?

134
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,583
Actually, no. I'm a Hunter.

135
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,583
A Hunter!

136
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:40,583
A Hunter!

00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,583
A Hunter!

00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,000
A Hunter!

139
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,583
What's a Hunter doing
fishing up here?

140
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,250
My kids and I like to do it.

141
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,333
We catch ancient fish to use
for my hunting equipment.

142
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:53,166
Oh, wow, I didn't know
there were so many resources

143
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,625
you could get from them.

144
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:58,208
We're sorry if we interrupted
your family activity.

145
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,333
It's fine.

146
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,875
We should move.

147
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,750
This area gets dangerous fast
when the Lagombi comes out.

148

Wait, a Lagombi?

00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,833
What? That's not
true. I do smile.

164
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,208
[BOTH chuckle]

165
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,541
[RIDDLEMASTER] Boys!
Got some guests that need help!

166
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,083
[BOTH]
'Kay!

167
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,208
[LUTE]
Here ya go!

168
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,375
Thanks, kid!

169
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,875
Yeah, thank you.

170
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,125
Whoa! Where'd you get
all the battle scars?

171
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,291
[HUNTER B]
Mm?

172
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,083
Oh, those? I was hunting
at Heaven's Mount.

173
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:59,166
A Seregios swooped down and
slashed me outta nowhere!

174
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,750
[HUNTER C] Injuries come with
the job when you're on a Quest.

175
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,000
You see these two?

176
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,625
I was wading through
the Flooded Forest

177
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,000
when I ran into a
Gobul's back spikes.

178
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,708
Got this big one from the
Gobul's cousin, the Nibelsnarf,

179
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,708
when he jumped me in the desert.

180
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,291
And finally, this is from when
I got a little too close

181
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,958
to a Gravios' breath.

182
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:19,041
It's crazy you've fought so
many different monsters.

183
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,166
Well, that's our job.

184
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,041
We Hunters hunt
what we're paid to

185
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,958
and the scars are souvenirs
we keep from each journey.

186
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,541
Interesting.

187
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,666
Yep, and over in Gildegaran,

188
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,916
you'll meet some of the most
skilled Hunters in the world!

189
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,333
Wait, Gildegaran?

190
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,083
That's exactly where I'm headed
once I pay off my debt!

191
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,500
[HUNTER B chuckles]

192
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,875
Don't quit your job. You ain't
ready for that journey.

193
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:40,500
What?

194
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:41,541
Hey, why not?

195
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,041
It's 'cause in
order to get there,

196
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,958
you have to first go through
the cave of a Khezu.

197
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,000
A Khezu?

198
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,583
[BOTH]
Wait, that thing?

199
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,791
So you've already had
a run in with it, huh?

200
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,958
Yeah, Khezu's a monster who'll
scare you outta your boots.

201
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:57,708
But wait! I have to get to
Gildegaran no matter what!

202
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,333
Is there another way?

203
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,166
You could ask the Wyverian
from the Arctic Ridge.

204
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,375
You know the Wyverian?

205
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,333
If you ever get
yourselves into trouble,

206
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:09,750
seek out the Wyverian who
lives in the Arctic Ridge.

207
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,708
[HUNTER B] Never seen
or met the guy myself,

208
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,625
but supposedly,
he's tall and fit

209
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,916
and has a way of makin'
ladies weak in the knees.

210
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,833
Basically, the kind of
guy they call a hunk.

211
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,458
Seek out the Wyverian?

212
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,375
The word on the street
is the guy's a total hunk.

213
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:32,375
Ha. Probably looks
a lot like Navirou.

214
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,583
Avinia, is something wrong?

215
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,583
The Wyverian's actually who
I've been looking for, too.

216
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:39,500
[BOTH]
What?

217
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,375
For real?

218
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,375
So you're on a hunk hunt?

219
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,416
My hope is that
if I can find him,

220
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,708
the Wyverian will be
able to re-awaken

221
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,083
Frostfang's lost powers.

222
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,875
[LUTE]
How did he lose them?

223
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:55,666
He went into some kind of shock
after fighting a rabid monster.

224
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,250
A monster that I now understand

225
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,208
was infected with
the Black Blight.

226
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,416
You've seen The
Black Blight too?

227
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,083
Yes, my whole village was
completely devastated

228
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,000
by Blighted monsters.

229
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,708
So if I could just
find the Wyverian,

230
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,833
I can heal Frostfang.

231
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,416
And if he has his powers back,

232
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,125
we'll have our
Kinship Attack again.

233
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:23,500
And we can stop the Black Blight
from doing any more damage.

234
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,166
[LUTE]
It's just like us.

235
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,000
We left our village
for the wider world

236
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,166
so we could stop
the Black Blight,

237
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,000
and that's why I'm trying to
become the best Rider ever!

238
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,166
Sounds like you've
got big plans.

239
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,333
Come on!

240
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,625
There are way more
important things to do

241
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,041
than cleaning up around here.

242
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,875
Let's go find the Wyverian
of the Arctic Ridge!

243
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,750
Yeah, let's find that hunk!

244
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,125
[AVINIA]
I'm coming, too.

245
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,208
But isn't your leg still hurt?

246
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,666
I feel fine now.

247
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,333
That hot spring helped me
more than I thought.

248
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,083
So let's go!

249
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,250
[BOTH]
Mh!

250
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,416
[LUTE]
Looks like we're all clear.

251
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,125
Now!

252
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,458
[LUTE, NAVIROU scream]

253
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,041
I reckon y'all tryin' to leave.

254
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,541
Riddlemaster, I'm sorry,

255
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,666
but we've gotta find the
Wyverian from the Arctic Ridge

256
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,958
before we run outta time!

257
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,625
Fine, but if you wanna leave,

258
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,958
ya gots to solve
my riddles first.

259
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,541
Didn't you just hear me?

260
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,958
We don't have time to solve
any more of your riddles!

261
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,708
I get that, but
what if I told you

262
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,291
I happen to know
this Wyverian feller?

263
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,041
[ALL gasp]

264
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,458
You know him?

265
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,750
The hunk second only to Navirou?

266
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,791
That's right, boys, I sure do.

267
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,125
And he's a
right-honest gentleman.

268
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,750
[LUTE] Well, that's great!
Can you take us to him?

269
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,875
Of course, I'm happy to.
Once you solve my riddles.

270
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,000
Ugh. C'mon, really?

271
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,666
There's no other choice,
Lute. We have to play.

272
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,166
Fine, guess we're stuck.

273
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,625
All right, pal, we'll answer
any riddle you've got!

274
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,958
Yeah! And in record time!

[HUNTER A sighs]

279

The rest of the way
should be an easy hike.

280
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,250
You'll be fine!

281
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,250
You'll be fine!

You'll be fine!

00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,416
You'll be fine!

284
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,208
We appreciate
everything you've done.

285
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,000
You saved our whole journey.

286
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,833
We won't forget your
help, Mister Hunter.

287
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,500
Thank you so much.

288
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:23,708
Oh, I almost forgot!

289
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,750
There's a hot springs
inn up ahead.

290
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,000
If I were you,
I'd stop and rest a bit.

291
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,000
Then go on to Gildegaran
at full-strength.

00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,750
All right. Thanks again.

00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,625
Oh, and if you do stop,

294
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,375
do you mind giving this
to the innkeeper for me?

295
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,625
[CHEVAL]
What is it?

296
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,166
That innkeeper and I go
back quite a long ways.

No way, boy.

Yeah, what he said!

Or maybe you don't even really
know how to find the Wyverian

310
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,208
and you've just been lying
to us this whole time!

You're only pretending to know

so you can have fun asking
us your dumb riddles!

315

[RIDDLEMASTER]
Don't be mean to me.

00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:33,375
[NAVIROU]
Um, Navirou's sorry, you know.

321
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,875
Oh, yeah?

322
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,666
Are you sorry enough to solve
another one of my riddles?

323
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,875
Sure, whatever you want, sir.

324
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,333
But after this, will
you please, finally,

325
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,708
take us to meet the Wyverian?

326
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,208
Yup. I promise.

327
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:50,250
I'm warnin' ya though, this
one's a real head-scratcher.

328
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,041
Riddle number 2-1.

329
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,708
Now, the Wyverian
from the Arctic Ridge

330
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,166
can never get enough of me!

331
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,875
So who am I?

332
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,500
The Wyverian can't
get enough of it?

333
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,416
I have no idea.

334
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,833
This one barely
counts as a riddle.

335
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,125
[RIDDLEMASTER chuckles]

336
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,833
It's a toughie, all right,

337
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,833
but if y'all can't
figure this one out,

338
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,208
then y'all're goin'
nowhere fast!

339
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,875
Ah!

340
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,625
Lute, think!

341
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,291
I knew y'all'd
never get this 'un.

342
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:24,333
Aw, man! And it's the
last riddle, too!

343
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,625
[CHEVAL]
Lute!

344
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,583
[LUTE]
Whoa! Cheval!

345
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,625
[NAVIROU]
And the others!

346
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,500
Hey, Lute! Where've you been?

347
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,583
We've been worried
sick about you two!

348
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm sorry, guys.

349
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,208
Well, all that matters
is we're back together.

350
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,041
That's right.

351
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,250
[LUTE]
Oh!

352
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,375
Avinia these are the
friends I told you about

353
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,791
and don't worry,
they're all Riders like me.

354
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,416
Nice to meet you.

355
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,000
Get this: She's a Rider, too!

356
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,416
You are? That's so great!

357
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,000
My name's Lilia.

358
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,250
Hello, I'm Mille.

359
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,708
I'm Hyoro!

360
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,291
And I'm Cheval. It's a pleasure.

361
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,791
Same to you.

362
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:04,166
I knew we'd meet back up
again after we got separated.

363
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,583
I was sure of it!

364
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,833
[NAVIROU]
Of course!

365
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,291
Navirou's navigational
skills never fail him!

366
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,791
[laughs]

367
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,041
Oh! Hold on.

368
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:16,583
A Hunter who helped us told me
to give this to the innkeeper.

369
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,833
Yeah, okay, he's that
big guy over there.

370
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,416
Uh, not so fast

371
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,750
I think ya forgot you were
smack dab in the middle

372
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,416
of answering one
of my riddles!

373
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,208
[LUTE]
Oh, yeah! The riddle thing.

374
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,541
[LILIA]
A riddle?

375
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,958
[CHEVAL]
Uh.

376
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:35,541
This is a gift from a Hunter
we met on the Arctic Ridge.

377
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,000
Well, this is it!
The right answer!

378
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,416
Hot Spring Dumplings!

379
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,458
[ALL]
Hot Spring Dumplings?

380
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,916
Those are just balls of moss!

381
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:57,166
Hits the spot! Deelicious.

382
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,458
Now this here is a hot spring
dumpling done just right!

383
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,291
Ball-a-steamed moss!

384
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,750
[laughs]

385
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,000
Well, great!

386
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,583
I'm glad you got what
you were looking for,

387
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,333
but what about us?

388
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah, what he said!

389
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,458
We've played your games

390
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,541
and you still won't take us
to meet our Wyverian hunk!

391
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,000
'Cause the Wyverian's
already here.

392
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:16,875
[gasps]

393
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,458
Wait, what?

394
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:21,166
[RIDDLEMASTER] The Wyverian
you all been lookin' for...

395
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,083
...is the Riddlemaster!

396
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,166
[ALL]
What?

397
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,916
Wait, hold on!
The Wyverian is tall.

398
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,666
And young!

399
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,250
And a total hunk!

400
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,750
Well, look at my skin.

401
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,458
The hot springs help make
it all smooth and clear.

402
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,833
So handsome!

403
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,375
And while I may not be a human,

404
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,541
I'm clearly a tall hunk
of somethin', right?

405
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,083
[ALL]
Uhh...

406
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,750
If you are the Wyverian,
then I need your help.

407
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,958
Please, give my dear
Frostfang his powers back.

408
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:51,375
Yep, I know all about
your situation, so--

409
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:59,625
Do you mind bringin' your
Monstie over here for me?

410

[ALL gasp]

411
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,291
All right, let's kick this off!

412
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,583
Now you riddle me this, kiddos,

413
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,916
what's big and loud
and needs to awaken?

414
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,500
The answer is: This 'un here!

415
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,875
What the heck is that?

416
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:39,958
He's doing his Frost Breath!
His special move!

417
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,708
[RIDDLEMASTER] Well, Miss,
looks like your Monstie

418
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,416
finally woke up!

419
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,833
Frostfang!

420
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,916
Oh, thank goodness. You're back

421
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,500
I don't know how I'll
ever repay you.

422
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,041
Thanks, Mister Wyverian!

423
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:58,000
Aw, you don't owe me nothin'
for anything now, Missy.

424
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,333
And Riddlemaster's
just fine with me.

425
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,541
Thanks again, Riddlemaster.

426

[RIDDLEMASTER chuckles]

00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,416
Next time, we'll
do more riddles!

428
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,875
[LUTE]
You can count on that!

[CHEVAL]
What a crazy couple of days.

432
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,208
[LILIA] And you were
injured, right, Avinia?

433
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,250
I was, but the
important thing is

434
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,166
you guys showed up and now
Frostfang's powers are back.

435
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,458
Good things happen when
you've got Navirou guiding you.

436
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,916
Yeah, I'd say the real help

437
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,750
came from that Hunter's
box of steamed moss.

438
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,916
This is it.

439
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,916
The Khezu's cave.

440
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,875
Ooh, Navirou doesn't
like these places!

441
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,625
Just put one foot in
front of the other,

442
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,416
and we'll make it
outta here alive.

443
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,625
Make sure to be careful.

444
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,958
The Khezu's known to
sneak up on its prey.

445
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,666
Nice knowing you, Hyoro.

It's just a drop of water.

00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,708
Oh, right.

Uh. But why's it so sticky?

Nice work.

Go on! You're almost
there, guys.

00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,458
Thank you.

473
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,000
But what are you going
to do now, Avinia?

474
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,791
We'll continue the
journey we've been on.

475
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,625
That means that just like you,

476
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,750
we'll try to stop
the Black Blight

477
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,500
and make sure it never
hurts anyone again.

478
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,458
That's great! Then I know
we'll see you soon!

I'm sure.

Until then, I'm glad we met,
Lute. Thanks to all of you!

481
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,166
You bet!

482
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,916
Avinia, it's not a "goodbye,"
it's a "see ya soon."

483
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,625
Thank you. Take care
of yourselves, you guys.

484
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,083
[LUTE]
And thank you, Frostfang!

485
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,291

486
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,791
[LILIA]
It's so warm out here!

487
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:19,500
[HYORO] From winter to spring
in just a couple steps.

488
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,541
[MILLE]
Look at these cherry blossoms!

489
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,291
Guys we finally made it!
That's Gildegaran up ahead!

490
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,541
Yeah.

<i>Monstie Manual</i> !

492
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,375
Here comes the part
where Navirou

493
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,958
teaches you about Monsties.

494
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,958
Now then, Navirou hopes you have

495
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,208
your Media Trigger Smart
Phone app open for this.

496
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,541
And get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

497
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:51,541
Now it's time to form a
Kinship with our Monsties!

498
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,666
The moment of new life!

499
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,958
Awaken!

500
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,916
[NAVIROU]
Our Monstie this time is: Khezu!

501
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,125
This creepy, pale beast

502
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:05,541
generates its own
electricity for attacks.

503
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,083
Khezu live in caves,

504
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:09,750
where they use thier prodigious
proboscis to sniff out prey.

505
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,291
Getting shocked
while riding one?

506
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:13,958
Navirou says, "No thanks!"

507
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:17,583
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!

508
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,083
[LUTE]
Hey! Lute here!

509
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,708
Well, we finally made it to
Gildegaran, and it's great!

510
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:24,666
Not only is it a magnet for
Hunters from all over the world,

511
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,291
it's got tons of
delicious food to eat!

512
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:29,750
Next time:
"Welcome to Gildegaran"!

513
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,291
Ride On!
