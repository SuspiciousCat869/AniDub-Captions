You be sure to keep it up during
tomorrow's Kinship Rite.

162
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,541
Yeah!

163
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,333
By the way, boys,
we seem to be running low

164
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,500
on some of our
Smoke Bomb materials.

165
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:25,958
When you've finished
with your training,

166
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,791
would you go out and collect
some more of them for me?

167
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,541
I found some!

168
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,458
Yeah, I found some, too.

169
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,291
You're good at everything.

170
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,250
No matter what
you're asked to do.

171
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,875
I'm just in top
form, that's all.

172
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,458
So tomorrow is the
day of the Rite.

173
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,583
I wonder what kinda
Monstie I'll get.

174
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:56,166
What are you hopin' for?
A speed type? Power type?

175
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,416
Ooh, or maybe a technique type?

176
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,791
[DAN chuckles]

177
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:05,041
Dan. I'm not gonna be a Rider.

178
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,875
[DAN]
Wha--?

179
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,500
I want... to be a sailor.

180
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,583
A sailor? What're you
talking about?

181
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:17,666
We're supposed to become
Riders tomorrow, aren't we?

182
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,750
No, not me.

183
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm gonna go sail
the high seas, Dan.

184
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,083
[DAN]
C'mon, quit playin' around!

185
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,250
[SILVA]
I know life on the water

186
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,958
will be totally
different from here.

187
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:30,166
[DAN] So are you telling me that
you're leaving the village?

188
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,708
Sorry, Dan, but
I wanna be a sailor,

189
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,833
and see all of the
world's oceans.

190
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,250
[grunts]

191
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:42,750
You can't mean that!
Silva! Think about it!

192
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,541
What's gonna happen if you
don't become a Rider?

193
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,791
You are the leader
of us! Remember?

194
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,708
Knowing you, you could
easily turn out to be

195
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,916
the best Rider in the world!

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,125
Sorry, Dan.

197
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,291
I refuse to accept this!

198
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,208
Listen to me.
My mind's made up!

199
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,500
You can't just decide
that for yourself!

200
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,958
What about me, huh? What'll
I do if you're not a Rider?

201
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,291
Sorry.

202
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,750
[grunts]

203
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,958
[screams]

204
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,041
Well, if you wanna
leave the village,

205
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:24,625
then you're gonna
have to beat me first.

206
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,583
That tree! I'll race
you to that tree.

207
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:34,583
And if I win,
then you become a Rider.

208
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,166
That's the deal.

209
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,250
All right.

210
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,791
Ready. Go!

211
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:09,541
[yelling]

212
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:15,166
Yes! I finally beat you!
I'm in top form!

213
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,958
Silva, you're gonna
be a Rider, too!

214
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,458
We'll be Riders together!

215
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,750
Hey.

216
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,416
But why?

217
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,583
Why're you standing
in my way, Dan?

218
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,541
Silva.

219
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:43,541
I'm begging...
Please, let me go.

220
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,458
I'm begging you.

221
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,750
Please, Dan.

222
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,750
Ride On!

223
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,625
Rathalos!

224
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,666
[CHIEF OMNA]
All right, Silva,

225
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,583
here's your Kinship
Stone and egg.

226
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,458
I don't want to be a Rider.

227
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,708
You don't?

228
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:26,583
Very well, if that's the
decision you've come to.

229
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,875
Then, you're up next, Dan.

230
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,583
[SILVA] I'm gonna be
leaving the village tomorrow

231
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,625
with some traders.

232
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,208
I'll travel to the port
to board a ship.

233
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,541
I'll be a sailor and
get to see the world.

234
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:50,708
And someday, I'll come back to
tell you all about my journeys.

235
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:03,666
[DAN] Silva, go be the best
sailor in the whole wide world.

236
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:14,541
And you go be the best Rider
in the whole wide world.

237
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:17,958
Yeah! We'll be in top form!

238
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,625
[SILVA] Once I've become
the world's best sailor,

239
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,916
I promise, I'll come back.

240
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,916
Bet this tree'll be
huge by then, huh?

241
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,250
[DAN]
I look forward to that.

242
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,416
[SILVA]
Yeah.

243
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,583
What's wrong?

244
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,833
You were just taking a
long time to get back.

245
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,625
I'm impressed you knew
where to find me.

246
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,208
Well, I kinda had a hunch.

247
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:15,208
You know, I've been thinking,

248
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:18,166
and I'm not sure if someone
like me should be the leader.

249
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,750
What?

250
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,458
[DAN]
Maybe I can be of more service

251
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,541
and provide better guidance
to the junior Riders

252
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,541
in some other way.

00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:45,291
The grass.
It's all turning black.

257
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,541
The changes that the
Scriveners warned us about.

258
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,291
They're spreading now.

259
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,541
Do you think that
it's gonna keep going?

260

Gotta move this tree!

You mean transplant it?
I'll help you.

264
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:08,250
I'm not about to let
this tree turn dark.

265
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,291
[NOLE] We should use
Monstie power, too.

266
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,083
Bring one of the ones that's
good at digging holes out here.

267
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,541
I could call someone.

268
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,583
Absolutely not. This is
my own personal matter.

269
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,250
Dragging any of the
other Riders into it

270
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,541
would be unfair and unwarranted.

gone berserk on us?

fleeing the dark changes.

just like Ratha's.

near the village?

mimicking Ratha's cry!

happened to him?

Yeah, like a moth

Hey, Dan!

329
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,583
Oh, yeah! We've got more help!

330
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:15,500
You came for me. But why?

331
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,291
Because, Dan,
you were in trouble.

332
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,541
You had us pretty worried.
So we rushed right here.

333
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,041
All of us wanted to
chip in and help you out.

You always do so
much for everyone,

00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,916
we figured it was the
least we could do.

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,041
That so?

337
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,416
That so?

338
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,791
Well, thanks, you guys.
Glad you showed up.

339
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,041
Well I guess as long
as you're all here,

340
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,208
wanna give us a hand
with something?

move it near the village.

[CHEVAL] Uh, I don't think
that's gonna work guys.

00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,166
We can do it! We can do it!

00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,500
Come on, let's do it together.

347
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,708
With some help
from the Monsties.

348
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:04,250
Hyoro, have your Bulldrome
start digging up the dirt.

My Yian kut-ku will join in.

this is okay, right?

Who's in top form?

There he goes sayin' it again.

356
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,000
I think it's an expression

357
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,708
that his old friend
used to always use,

358
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,000
so it must mean
something to him, right?

359
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,958
What's that? I can't hear you!

I really hope Silva
comes back soon.

Hey, Dan, you haven't
finished fixing the roof yet.

367
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:16,750
Dan, I thought that you were
gonna gather ingredients for me.

368
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:19,500
Hey, Dan, a herd of Genprey
are down by the riverbed

369
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:20,791
and they won't budge.

Please, you have to
chase them away.

Here comes the part
where Navirou

teaches you about Monsties.

Now then, Navirou hopes you have

your Media Trigger Smart

this time is: Qurupeco!

Check out that unusual coloring!

385
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,625
Their ability to mimic
other monsters' calls

386

is what sets them apart.
