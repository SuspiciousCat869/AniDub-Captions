[NARRATOR]
This young boy's name is Lute,

5
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:26,500
a rash, but enthusiastic fellow
who dreams of becoming

6
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:29,291
the world's top Monster Rider.

7
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,291
For now, he's still
an apprentice Rider.

8
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:32,750
Just between us,

9
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,000
he hasn't even gotten the
hang of riding his Monstie.

10
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:38,291
Hey, Lute. Why is
Ratha acting so weird?

11
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,958
It's out of character for
him to freak out like that.

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,458
Yeah.

13
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,708
[NARRATOR] Lute has grown up
alongside Cheval and Lilia,

his two closest friends.

15
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,791
Cheval is a fellow
apprentice Rider.

16
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:51,333
While Lilia has dreams of
leaving their small village

17
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,458
and seeing what the
world has to offer.

18
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:57,333
[CHEVAL] It's not like him at
all. There's gotta be a reason.

19
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:58,500
I wonder what.

20
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:00,416
I've got no idea.

Leave it to Dan. Piece of cake.

He had a tough time actually.

You're in poor form.
What's bothering you?

Yeah, what's up, Ratha?

30
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,833
I've never seen you
suddenly go crazy like that.

31
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,291
Do you have a stomachache?

[LUTE] Of all the pranks...
Who would do this?

37
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,500
Pretty rotten sticking it in
a place he couldn't scratch.

38
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,875
[DAN] Even a good boy like Ratha
is bound to get annoyed by that.

39

Do we have any suspects?

40
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:52,791
My guess:

41
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,916
It's someone who craves
attention and loves jokes.

Navirou's so spellbinding
you're lost in admiration.

Absolutely not.

[NAVIROU yelps]

What other explanation is
there to gaze at Navirou?

51
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,000
We were wondering if you

52
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,291
attached this stick
man to Ratha.

53
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,875
Ha!

54
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,666
Like Navirou, comedic genius,
would use such lowbrow humor.

Without any hesitation.

[NAVIROU yelps]

Unfortunately for you,
Navirou has an air-tight ablibi

60
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,375
'cause he's been eating
donuts all afternoon.

61
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,541
No offense, but that's
a terrible alibi.

00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,958
It sounds suspicious.

Mh-hm.

Innocent until proven guilty.

65
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,625
Navirou was too engrossed
in those delectable donuts

66
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,750
to commit a crime!

67
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,750
That doesn't make
any sense, Navirou.

out of town buying supplies?

Yes.

That probably explains the

They were acting up as
soon as their folks left,

Yeah, I know right?

When I was a kid,

anything wrong with it.

484
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,458
Wow, Dan. Really?

485
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:34,291
If someone points in the
same direction as Navirou,

486
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,416
that can't be good.

487
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,000
Poor form yet again.

488
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:42,000
With all these clouds, I've lost
track of the moon's position.

489
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,208
Which means I have no idea
how to navigate us home.

490
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,875
In short, we're lost.

491
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:49,125
[ALL]
Huh?!

492
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,791
So cold!

493
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,791
And Navirou misses his donuts!

494
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,250
[roaring]

495

[LILIA]
Is that--?

496
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,083
It's a signal!

497
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,041
You're right! It's showing
us the way back home!

498
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,833
Chief Omna must be behind this.

499
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,500
Your mom's dinnertime
signal is kind of famous.

500
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,250
Everyone in the
village knows it.

501
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,750
Yeah, that's right!

502
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:14,250
Because, after all, Hakum
Village is like one big family.

503
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,750
You said it!

504
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,791
So who's ready to get
outta these woods?

505
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,500
[OTHERS]
Yeah!

506
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:29,833
Hey!

507
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,333
We made it home!

508
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,500
[CHEVAL]
Hi, everyone!

509
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,125
[NAVIROU]
You missed Navirou! Admit it!

510
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,416
Found your way back, I see.

511
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,958
We had a little help.

512
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,541
[VLAU]
You had us so worried!

513
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,000
You kids!

514
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,000
What in the blazes
were you all thinking?

515
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,541
Thank your lucky stars
you're still in one piece.

516
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:46,833
It's bad enough for the kids

517
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,500
to venture into
the forest at night,

518
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,750
but, Dan, to find out you
went alone after them!

519
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,916
Yes. I apologize.

520
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,208
Now, Gamigami.

521
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,916
What matters is that
everyone got home safely.

522
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,083
All thanks to the signal, Chief!

523
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,791
There's a full moon out tonight.

524
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:05,250
Which means the Kometas ought
to be returning to us shortly.

525
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,666
Even with all these clouds,

526
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,583
I doubt that master buyers
Toto and Kaka Kometa

527
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:10,875
could ever lose their way.

528
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,250
Did you guys hear that?

529
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:16,125
Your parents never get lost!
They're master buyers!

530
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,333
[TWINS laugh]

531
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,583
Hey! Over there!

We're back, Hakum Village!

533
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:31,125

Papa! Mama! Welcome home!

[NAVIROU]
<i>Monstie Manual</i> !

536
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,541
Here comes the part
where Navirou

537
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,041
teaches you about Monsties.

538
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,041
Now then, Navirou hopes you have

539
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,291
your Media Trigger Smart
Phone app open for this.

540
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,791
And get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

541
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:51,541
Now it's time to form a
Kinship with our Monsties!

542
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,625
The moment of new life.

00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,958
Awaken!

544
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:02,000
[NAVIROU] Our Monstie
this time is: Gypceros!

545
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:05,083
It's high endurance means
it can run forever and a day!

546
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,750
But watch out!
This is one smart bird!

547
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:10,916
It can spit poison and create
disorienting flashes of light!

548
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,916
Even Monsties are suckers
for shiny objects!

549
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,916
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,416
[LUTE]
Lute here!

by a traveling fashionista!

Powderkeg Pink,
the Pushy Peddler,

553
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,750
and her adorable Felyne
assistant Mocha!

554
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,250
Wait. What?

00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,791
