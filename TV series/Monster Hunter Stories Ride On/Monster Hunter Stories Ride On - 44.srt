1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,416
[NARRATOR]
These youngsters are Riders,

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,875
on a quest to track down
blackened Kinship Ore

3
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:17,333
and stop the Black Blight that's
been spreading across the world.

4
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:19,833
After Lute met up with
Lilia in Gildegaran,

5
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:22,833
who should appear out of the
shadows but Mille and Hyoro,

6
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:26,333
Lute's estranged friends
from back home.

7
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,750
They had left Cheval behind

8
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:30,041
as he charged down
a dangerous path,

9
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:34,875
and were now seeking the path
that they were meant to follow.

10
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:37,541
Reunited at last,
Lute and his friends set out

11
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:42,458
for the Forest of Confusion to
find the Kinship Ore within.

12
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,666
There they bumped
into Genie and Stone,

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,833
two senior Hakum Riders hot on
the trail of a Blighted monster.

14
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,583
I never agreed with
the choice you made.

15
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,416
I only allowed it because
it's more important

16
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,916
for you to choose your own path.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,125
But a man who can't see his own
choices through is a disgrace.

18
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:02,541
And is no Rider,
or brother, to me.

19
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,625
Genie.

20
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:08,708
Genie shunned Hyoro for not
staying true to his convictions,

21
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,458
but upon seeing
his little brother

22
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:13,833
perform admirably in battle
against the Blighted monster,

23
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,958
Genie had a change of heart.

24
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:18,916
[GENIE]
I was right, Hyoro.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,458
You're not the person
I thought you were.

26
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,833
You're a true Rider.

27
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,125
Genie!

28
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:29,000
Brothers are great. I want one.

29
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:31,041
[LILIA] But in a way,
you do have a brother.

30
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,166
His name is Cheval.

31
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,333
You always say you're family.

32
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,625
[NARRATOR]
Lute sees himself and Cheval

33
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:42,333
reflected in the reconciled
brothers' relationship.

34
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:45,625
And so the optimistic young
Rider continues ever onward,

35
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:48,458
to restore the Kinship he
shared with his dear friend,

36
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,875
and to save the world
from the Black Blight.

37
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:53,041
Next stop, the
Forest of Confusion

38
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,125
to find that Kinship Ore.

39
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,666
[LUTE]
The path splits here.

40
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,125
Leave it to Navirou's
navigation skills!

41
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,166
Hmm...

42
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,250
This way!

43
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,791
So that way then, huh?

44
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,375
[NAVIROU yelps]

45
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,125
I think maybe we oughta split
up, just to be on the safe side.

46
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,625
All right then, we'll
go in that direction.

47
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,208
And if anyone finds
the Kinship Ore,

48
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:18,041
use your Field Horn to let
everybody else know.

49
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,791
Mille, hold on.

50
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,541
[MILLE]
Hm? What's up?

51
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:25,291
Don't forget what I said
earlier, about the lightning.

52
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,291
It'll help if you guys
get lost out there.

53
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,916
Yeah, I remember.

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,083
You guys be careful
and try to stay safe.

55
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,041
Yep! Will do!

56
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,041
Hey, what was that
about the lightning?

57
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,083
Uh, dunno. It beats me.

58
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,375
[LILIA] Guys, we just talked
about this at breakfast.

59
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,750
Weren't you listening? Honestly.

60
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,208
Before we left Gildegaran,

61
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,083
I was going through
a bunch of old texts,

62
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:49,666
and happened to find some
ancient lore about these woods.

63
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,875
"At the ends of the
Forest of Confusion,

64
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,375
beyond the lightning-wielding
phantom beast,

65
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,791
sleeps the Crystal of Rapport."

66
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,250
Lilia, be sure to tell Lute,

67
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,000
"If at any point you get
lost in the woods,

68
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,416
just keep an eye
on the lightning."

69
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,541
Sure, I'll tell him. But why?

70
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,875
[SIMONE]
You see, many years ago,

71
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,791
a lightning-wielding
phantom beast

72
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:13,583
was responsible
for saving my life.

73
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,166
Ever since, I've hoped
to thank my savior.

74
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,708
Show my gratitude.

75
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:21,041
You kids go on ahead.
And I'll be right behind you.

76
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,375
Yes, ma'am!

77
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,541
[LUTE]
"Keep an eye on the lightning"

78
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,416
sounds all well and good, but...

79
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,375
Gonna be hard to find
lightning to keep an eye on

80
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,375
on such a sunny day.

81
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,916
C'mon. We'll just see what
happens if we get lost.

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,375
Maybe it'll make sense then!

83
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:41,166
Yeah, good point!
Now, follow me, guys!

84
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,916
[PAPPAN] Oh, boy,
this forest sure is creepy.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,625
You know, they say
that once somebody

86
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,333
goes into the Forest
of Confusion,

87
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,833
they can never find their
way back out again.

88
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,500
That's because there
are no maps of it,

89
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,750
and compasses don't work here.

90
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:58,208
If we get separated and you're
lost out there all by yourself.

91
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,833
[PAPPAN whimpers]

92
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,708
Just keep an eye out for
lightning and you'll be fine.

93
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,250
Really, that's it?

94
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,750
Is that how you were able to
find that phantom beast before?

95
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,208
By following the lightning?

96
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,791
Yes.

97
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:14,291
It was back in the days right
after I'd joined the Scriveners.

98
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,166
I had received reports of
an unidentified monster

99
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,666
that had been spotted
in the forest.

100
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,166
My squad and I
quickly mobilized,

101
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,125
but then a rainstorm
suddenly began.

102
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:32,458
I got separated from my men
and soon lost my way.

103
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,916
It was then that a bright light
flashed across the sky,

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,041
as though guiding me
through my exhaustion.

105
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,875
Using that lightning
as a signpost,

106
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,458
I ventured forth
into the darkness.

107
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:54,041
This place, what is it?

108
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,833
[SIMONE]
Looking back, I now believe

109
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,666
that was the lightning-wielding
phantom beast.

110
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,000
[SIMONE]
When I came to,

111
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:10,083
I was staring up at
an unfamiliar ceiling.

112
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,583
Apparently I'd been rescued
at the forest entrance,

113
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,625
on the verge of collapse.

114
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,875
After that, my squad and
I searched everywhere,

115
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,125
but we were never
able to find them.

116
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,083
Not that mysterious
white clearing,

117
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,583
and not my phantom
beast rescuer.

118
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:29,291
As though all of it were
nothing more than an illusion.

119
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:32,666
This world is still rich with
mysteries yet to be solved.

120
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,250
And as for me?

121
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,208
My mission is to
study this forest,

122
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,041
its undiscovered monsters
and untouched vegetation,

123
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,875
so that I may aid
future researchers.

124
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:45,041
Huh? Didn't we just
come through here?

125
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,958
Oh, man, are we lost?

126
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,875
[DEBLI] That's the Forest
of Confusion for you!

127
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,125
Don't you see what
happened here?!

128
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,625
If only you'd followed Navirou's
expert advice before,

129
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,416
we wouldn't have wasted
our time going around

130
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,791
in a giant circle!

131
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,583
Yeah, yeah, I was wrong.

132
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,416
So this time, we're gonna
follow your lead, all right.

133
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,416
Well, which way?

134
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,541
This way!

135
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,833
Hey, wait.

136
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,708
Back here? Again?

137
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,458
Oh, we're hopelessly lost.

138
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:18,291
Because you followed
Navirou's directions.

139
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,833
And that's a Navi-rule.

140
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,500
Wow, what a downpour!
At this rate--

141
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,125
A-choo! We'll catch a cold!

142
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,583
Come on, let's go try
to find some shelter.

143
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,791
Hold on. We lost Debli!

144
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,041
[NAVIROU]
Huh?

145
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,750
Oh, Debli. And after he
tells us to follow him.

146
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,875
Now he's run off and
gotten himself lost.

147
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,333
Saw that one coming.

148
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,083
Gotta hand it to him, he's
nothing if not dependable.

149
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,875
Hey! Tubbli!

150
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,250
[DEBLI]
"Tub" nothing!

151
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,541
Wait, that was him!

152
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,500
[LUTE, NAVIROU]
Hey! Tubbli! Tub--

153
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,833
[DEBLI]
Stop calling me that!

154
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,666
It came from over there!

155
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,958
Are you all right, Lilia?

156
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,208
My bag!

157
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,708
It's okay, I'll go find
it once the rain stops.

158
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,083
Don't worry about it!

[LUTE] You're not going
anywhere on that leg.

162

Finding shelter's gotta
be our top priority.

163
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:16,208
And afterwards, we can
go looking for Tubbli.

What were you doing down there?

00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,458
Found Divine Rhinos
and couldn't resist.

Always getting us
worked up over nothing!

Y'know, you can buy a whole
lotta donuts with one of these!

You chose wisely.
Navirou approves.

Yeah, a little.

That's awful.

at the bottom of that cliff...

Ah, that reminds me.
You dropped this earlier.

I'm so grateful, Debli!

I don't know how I
can ever thank you!

yours is thanks enough!

No, no, no.

It's not anywhere in here.

00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,208
your friends are
simply unconscious.

they oughta do the trick.

00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,750
Whoa, sounds like you
know what that thing was.

307
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,416
Kirin, an Elder Dragon.

Also known as the
"Phantom Beast."

309
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,500
So that was Kirin.

310
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,958
Are you sure about that?

311
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,833
It wasn't in Navirou's
<i>Monsterpedia</i> ! He checked!

312
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,458
Yes, well, Elder Dragons
aren't like other monsters.

313
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,250
They're a special class
that don't really fit

314

into any particular ecosystem,

315
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,541
so your average guidebook
may not include them.

316
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,291
But luckily, my big one
does, and then some!

317
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,125
So then, you got to meet Kirin?

318
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,916
Lute, we saw the light
from your Kinship attack!

319
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,500
Where's the monster now?

320
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,791
It just... vanished.

321
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,791
[GENIE]
It vanished?

322
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,750
[STONE]
You mean you purified it?

323
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:35,666
No, it... It wasn't afflicted
with the Black Blight at all.

324
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,416
Its eyes were perfectly clear.

325
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,208
I hope to see it again.

326
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,625
Your Kinship Stone!

327
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,500
[LILIA] "At the ends of
the Forest of Confusion,

328
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,833
beyond the lightning-wielding
phantom beast...

329
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,916
...sleeps the Crystal
of Rapport."

330
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,958
So all this time, it was
guarding this Kinship Ore.

331
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,458
Oh, wow, your Kinship
Stone is glowing!

332
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:26,500
Whoa, is the Kinship
Ore doing that?

333
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:30,625
It's proof of the Kinship
that Lute and Kirin share.

334
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,000
Of that, I'm quite certain.

335
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,875
[SIMONE]
It seems I was mistaken.

336
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,291
I had wanted to survey
the Forest of Confusion

337
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:55,500
in order to confirm the
existence of phantom beasts.

338
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,875
I was convinced that such
advancements in knowledge

339
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:01,291
would lead this world
in a better direction.

340
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,458
But now, I'm thinking perhaps
there are some things

341
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,791
in nature that simply were
never meant to be explained.

342
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,625
But, Captain Simone.

343
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,916
This world is still
rich with mysteries.

344
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
That's right!

345
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:15,000
Captain Simone-
Simone-Simone...

346
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,666
Give Navirou-Navirou-Navirou...

347
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,375
...many, many
donuts-donuts-donuts...

348
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,958
...right away-away-away-away...

349
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:23,791
[SIMONE]
Let's go.

350
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:24,375
[PAPPAN]
Yes, ma'am.

351
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,875
[NAVIROU yelps]

352
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,875
Well, Lute, we're
heading home now.

353
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,375
Back to Hakum Village.

354
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,708
I guess this is
goodbye for now.

355
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,958
If you happen to see
Cheval out there,

356
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,375
tell him we're waiting
at Hakum Village.

357
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,125
And that we'll be
keeping it safe

358
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,291
until he's ready to come home.

359
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,250
Got it. I'll let him know.

360
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,958
Guess we should be
getting back to Gildegaran.

361
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,250
And we're off!
Adventure calls out to us!

362
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,000
C'mon, gang, follow
Navirou to glory!

363
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,833
Wait, are you sure we should
be following your lead?

364
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,333
You'll probably just
get us lost again.

365
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:04,791
Oh, yeah? Like you're one
to talk, huh, Tub... bli?

366
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,000
Debli! It's Debli!

367
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:10,541
[BOTH laughing]

368
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,791
We'll meet again.

For you and I are bound
together by Kinship.

[NAVIROU]
<i>Monstie Manual</i> !

371
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,500
Here comes the part
where Navirou

372
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,000
tells you about Monsties.

373
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:41,958
All right, Navirou
hopes you have

374
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,208
your Media Trigger
Smart Phone app open.

375
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,625
Better get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

376
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:51,833
And now, it's time to form
a Kinship with our Monsties!

377
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,958
The moment of new life!

Awaken!

[NAVIROU]
Our Monstie this time is: Kirin!

380
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,375
This elusive monster is
one of the Elder Dragons,

381
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:07,333
and you'd be super-lucky to
have this as your Monstie!

382
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:09,833
Oh, and hey, it can
command lighting

383
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,250
with its speedy movements.

384
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,916
Just like Navirou!

385
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,166
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!

386
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,166
[LUTE] There are seven
Kinship Ore in total.

And now we're off to
a legendary location

388
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,833
in search of the last one!

of Mt. Celion"!
