00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:10,458
[NARRATOR] Previously,
on <i>Monster Hunter Stories</i> ,

2
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:12,708
a Tigrex attacked Hakum
Village in the middle

3
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:15,250
of the apprentice
Riders' Kinship Rite!

4
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:18,041
At the last minute,
Lute and Ratha swooped in,

5
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,666
capturing the Tigrex.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,000
Lute and his friends left
home for the first time,

7
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:25,416
hiking up into the mountains
to return the wayward beast.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,083
But more trouble soon arose,

9
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:30,416
and the kids got their first
look at a real Hunter in action!

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,916
Our young Riders were left
with much to think about

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,041
as they returned home.

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,708
Navirou can't wait to
see what'll happen next!

13
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,458
[CHIEF OMNA] With the threat of
the Tigrex now safely behind us,

14
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,666
we can resume the Kinship Rite.

15
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,208
[KIDS]
Sir!

16
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,500
You will venture outside the
village, this time into a cave,

17
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,416
and swear an oath at
the Waterfall of Trials.

18
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,208
I know each of you wishes to
be a certain type of Rider,

19
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,791
and in saying this oath
that wish will be impressed

20
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,416
upon your hearts.

21
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,416
But as its name implies, the
Waterfall cannot be reached

22
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,791
without first overcoming
many a trial.

23
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,083
It is not the bond between
you and your Monstie

24
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,916
that matters here, but
the bond between each other.

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,791
Cooperation is key!

26
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:08,916
[KIDS]
Sir!

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,083
Top form! I like
that spirit, Riders!

28
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,583
And trust me, you'll need
it all in that cave.

29
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,375
[laughs]

30
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,791
You'll also need courage and
wisdom with your cooperation.

31
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,041
Good luck, my young Riders.

32
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,083
What's up, Cheval?

33
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,208
This feels weird without Lilia.

34
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,958
Yeah, you're right.
I haven't seen her all day.

35
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,666
I know she doesn't
wanna be a Rider now,

36
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,750
but I thought she still wanted
to see the Kinship Rite.

37
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,833
I guess she changed her mind.

38
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,708
[DAN] All right, Riders,
this is as far as I go.

39
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,458
When it comes to finding the
waterfall, you're on your own!

40
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,208
[HYORO] Wait, we have to get
through that cave alone?

41
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,250
[DAN]
Well, yeah.

42
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,708
The point of the
Waterfall of Trials

43
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,625
is you figure them
out as a group.

44
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,041
If it goes well,

45
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,333
the experience will strengthen
your bonds as friends.

46
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,791
I mean, if you can't maintain
Kinship with your friends,

47
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,791
you probably won't be someone
who has Kinship with a monster.

48
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:04,083
Ahh, I don't know about this.
We don't even have a map.

49
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,458
What if we get lost
in their forever?

50
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,666
[MILLE]
Don't be such a baby!

51
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,791
Plenty of other kids
have done this before!

52
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:09,916
[HYORO]
Hey.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,208
There's nothin' to
worry about, buddy.

54
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,833
We got this in the bag!

55
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,416
Yeah, and Navirou's directions
will be a huge help.

56
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,250
Can you think of one time when
his directions have been right?

57
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,625
We'd have better luck
in there blindfolded.

58
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:21,583
Ya see?

59
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,208
Hey! Don't be mean to Navirou!

60
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,333
Just for that, Navirou
will find the Falls first

61
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,500
and prove once and for all

62
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,625
Navirou has the best
sense of direction!

63
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,083
Nerve of those guys.

64
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:34,416
Well, guess it's our turn!

65
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,583
I'll be waiting out
here the whole time.

66
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,625
So if anything happens,
I can run right in.

67
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,333
Deepening your Kinship
isn't only for Monsties.

68
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,625
The bonds you have with your
friends are just as important!

69
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,625
[LOLOA]
Hey.

70
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,625
If you're so worried they'll
get into trouble in that cave,

71
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,208
you should just go with them!

72
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,583
But I'm not going to
be a Rider anymore.

73
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,916
I'm not supposed to take
part in the Kinship Rite.

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,958
But Loloa was certain her big
sister was going to be a Rider.

75
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,083
[DAN yawning]

76
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,833
Now's my chance!

77
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,541
No, you can't go!
It's too dangerous!

78
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,916
Not true!

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,458
I brought a map of the
entire cave system with me.

80
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,208
I'll be fine. You can
go home, Loloa.

81
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,416
Wait, sis!

82
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,750
[HYORO yelps]

83
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,833
[MILLE] Jeez, Hyoro! Do you
have to make so much noise?

84
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,333
Sorry.

85
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,833
Really, there's no point in
being scared during the day.

86
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,333
It's night when
you should worry.

87
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,333
Don't you know this cave is
full of nocturnal monsters?

88
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,958
Drag your feet enough and
the sun will go down

89
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,291
while we're still in here.

90
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,166
Before you know it,
the whole cave will be full

91
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,083
of glowing eyes and
glistening, white fangs!

92
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,583
All right, let's go!

93
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,208
[MILLE]
Much better!

94
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,583
Nice job, Mille.

95
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:49,916
As expected.

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,333
[NAVIROU]
Mh-hm.

97
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,541
Not bad at all.

98
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,166
[KIDS gasp]

99
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,166
What're you doing here?

100
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,000
I thought you'd be
way ahead of us.

101
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,041
"Navirou has the best
sense of direction!"

102
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,958
Isn't that what you said?

103
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,375
But you forgot the part
where Navirou feels bad

104
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,833
and comes back to
keep you company.

105
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,208
You should thank him.

106
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,750
It sounds like it was
you who needed company.

107
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,166
So not true, Cheval!

108
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,041
Navirou is just
fine being alone!

109
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,416
Yeah, sure.

110
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,666
Hey, get back here!
You can't leave Navirou behind!

111
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,958
[LUTE]
Which way?

112
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,250
Navirou smells victory this way!

113
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,500
Well, c'mon!
Follow Navirou to glory!

114
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:29,875
[NAVIROU screams]

115
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,208
[LUTE laughs]

116
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,583
So where's all that glory
you were talkin' about?

117
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,666
If Navirou says we go left,
then we go right.

118
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,458
It doesn't seem smart
to pick so quickly.

119
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:40,458
Of course it's smart.

120
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,000
If we're wrong,
we just come back.

121
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:45,166
Second-guessing is the
real problem. Let's go!

122
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,208
That's enough, Mille. I'm done.

123
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,958
I don't belong out here.
I'm going home.

124
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,291
Besides, we all know I was never
gonna make it as a Rider.

125
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,250
You're being too
hard on yourself.

126
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,208
Hyoro, you've got what it takes
to be a Rider and then some.

127
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,125
You're the only one of us
who hatched a Bulldrome egg.

128
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,375
Hpmh.

129
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,666
If you wanna go home,
you should just go home.

130
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,666
You're obviously not going
to put forth the effort,

131
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,250
so why are you even here?

132
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,416
I mean, let's be honest:

133
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,041
You only started
doing any of this

134
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,375
because your brother
Genie made you, right?

135
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,500
Oh, yeah? Well,
what about your reason?

136
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:18,041
You're only here because
of your rivalry with Lilia!

137
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,500
You're so obsessed with her.

138
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,416
When she decided not to be
a Rider, you got depressed!

139
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,041
Oh, Mille.

140
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,208
How dare you say that to me!

141
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,625
You don't know anything!

00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,333
Hey, wait!

143
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,666
Well, Hyoro.

144
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,166
Apologizing to her's
now your first trial.

145
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,125
I know, it's a hard one.

146
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,166
Who does that guy think he is?

147
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,416
Like I really care
what Lilia does.

148
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,875
That's right, pal. I've got
my own future to worry about!

00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:15,500
Lute, wait!

160
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:16,541
[NAVIROU]
Great, he took the bait!

161
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,875
You know how to
capture him, right?

162
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:18,666
Nope!

163
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,208
What?!

164
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:25,250
[LUTE, NAVIROU screaming]

165
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,666
Oh, man.

166
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,916
It's a smoke bomb.

167
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,916
Lute, get down!

168
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,791
[sighs]

169
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:44,375
Honestly.

170
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,750
Hey, Mille?

171
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,208
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
said those awful things.

172
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,125
And I'm sorry for
throwing my torch at you.

173
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,291
I didn't mean to.

174
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,000
It's all right.
Here's your Kinship Stone.

175
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,625
I appreciate it.

176
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,583
Thanks, Hyoro.

177
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,625
It's nice to see that
under your hard exterior,

178
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,000
you have a soft side.

179
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,500
Hey! Shut up!

180
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,625
You had to get in the
last word, didn't you?!

181
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,666
What? But I--

182
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,458
It's a dead end.

183
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,166
Come on!

184
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,375
No! You can't give up now, guys.

185
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,416
There's a clue right
there in front of you!

186
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,791
You have to look up!

187
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,333
[gasps]

188
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,416
I did the right thing saving
them from that Bnahabra,

189
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,000
but this is a part that they
must pass on their own.

190
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,916
I'm not a Rider.
I can only watch.

191
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,916
The only thing I can think is

192
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,500
maybe we should've gone
the other way at that fork.

193
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,041
Hold on.

194
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,083
If you're blaming me for our
current situation, just do it!

195
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,083
No, I'm not trying
to blame you at all.

196
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,625
I don't think arguing is
helping us get anywhere, guys.

197
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,166
Flashbugs?

198
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,916
We don't go through
the wall, we go up it!

199
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,625
Nice, Cheval!

200
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,291
Amazing.

201
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,083
All right!

202
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,583
[CHEVAL] We're getting
closer to that waterfall!

203
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,666
Let's go!

204
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,291
[NAVIROU]
C'mon, everyone!

205
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,583
Navirou leads the way!

206
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,333
[NAVIROU yells]

207
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,000
[NAVIROU screams]

208
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,250
[NAVIROU]
Navirou meant to do that.

209
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,666
[KIDS sigh]

210
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,125
I'll climb it first.

211
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,125
What?

212
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,125
I'm good at rock climbing.

213
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,416
[HYORO]
Wow, Cheval really is good.

214
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,958
[MILLE]
He's so fast.

215
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,291
Ready?

216
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,833
We'll get to those
Falls in no time.

217
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,291
Ah, man! I hate this!

218
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,875
Just take it slow and
don't look down, guys.

219
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,416
That's right!

220
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,916
Navirou wants no complaining.
Take it slow and up you go!

221
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,291
I've just about had it with you.

222
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,666
So, uh, you think this is it?

223
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,208
This sure looks like the
Sacred Spring, all right.

224
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,958
I wanna be a Rider who
always helps those in trouble!

225
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,666
I want to be a Rider who
never runs from a challenge,

226
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,166
no matter how dangerous
that challenge may be.

227
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,625
My desire is to form a deep
Kinship with my Monstie.

228
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,416
I hope to become the
world's best Rider.

229
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,458
No, wait. I will be!

Fear not. We mean you no harm.

doing all the way up here?

Like a graceful bird.

Thank you so much, Miss--

[LUTE]
She's awake!

270
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,208
You're in the Chief's house.

271
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,791
You were brought here
after collapsing

272
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,458
at the Waterfall of Trials.

273

Are you okay?
Any aches or pains, dear?

274

[LILIA]
Uh, no.

275
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,208
Thank goodness.

276
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,416
For a while, you had
us pretty scared.

277
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,833
Your prompt treatment
worked, I see. Good.

278
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,291
In worst-case scenarios,
if no antidote is used,

279
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,708
the Iodrome's poison
can be quite deadly.

280

[LOLOA]
Loloa's so sorry!

281
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,750
You only got sprayed
because Loloa followed you

282
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:54,916
into the caves and was--

283
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,416
Don't apologize!

284
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,416
What?

285
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,875
If you hadn't gotten in
trouble with those monsters,

286
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,833
I wouldn't have gotten a chance
to meet Mistress Red Swan!

287
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,583
Are we sure she's okay?

288
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:09,000
I've heard Iodrome poison can
do some nasty stuff to you.

289
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,000
Navirou definitely knew that.

290
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:14,041
[LILIA] Guys, I'm fine!
Now where is Mistress Red Swan?

291
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,708
Huh? Red Swan?

292
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,666
You mean the lady who saved you?

293
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,916
[SIMONE]
I've never met anyone

294
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,583
who's exchanged Kinship
with a monster before.

295
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,291
Do you mind if I sketch you?

296
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,500
Uh, yeah! I'm in top form!

297
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,375
Lilia, I thought you
wanted to thank her.

298
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,875
I do, it's just--

299
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,041
What happened?
You were so excited.

300
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,625
Now that I see her
again, I'm nervous.

301
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:47,083
[NAVIROU] You miss 100% of
the shots you don't take.

302
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,791
And I'm taking this
lovely lady's heart

303
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,166
with my own two paws.

304
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,875
That's Navirou!

305
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,541
So what's with that cape?
What's he doing?

306
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,750
He looks ridiculous.

307
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,375
A warning.

308
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,666
Fall for Navirou and
you'll only get burned.

309
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,875
[SIMONE] Wow, I've never seen
a Felyne like this before.

310
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,666
Your facial symmetry
is practically divine!

311
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,541
And your tail, too.

312
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,208
Everything about you!

313
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,916
Unique from head to toe.

314
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,416
Marvelous!

315
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,291
So Navirou has stolen your
heart, just as he expected to.

316
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,333
Heh.

317
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:22,166
You may now pet.
Navirou always wins.

318
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,041
Whether it's on a quest,
or in the pursuit of romance.

319
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,958
I think he's only
getting weirder.

320
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,041
Yeah.

00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,291
Rathalos, King of the Skies!

322
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,958
I've never actually seen
one in person before!

323
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,291
It's beautiful!

00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,583
Careful, ma'am!

325

Ratha gets bitey around
people he doesn't know.

I'll be fine.

00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,416
Hello, my name is Simone.

328
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,250
I'm captain of the
Royal Scriveners.

329
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,291
It's an honor to meet you.

330
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,416
Wow, Ratha is being good.

331
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,291
What's your secret, ma'am?

332
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,416
Oh, I didn't do
anything special.

333
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,250
I've merely expressed
my own feelings to it.

334
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,208
Expressed your feelings?

335
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,458
The joy, surprise, and thrill
that comes with meeting it here.

336
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,833
I look deep into its eyes with
those feelings in my heart.

337
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,375
And in turn, they get
through to its own heart.

338
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,375
Humans and monsters are both
living things, after all.

339
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:20,000
Sharing honest feelings can work
just like a common language.

340
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,333
Hard to believe it's
been 30 long years

341
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,791
since the last Chief Scrivener
graced our little village

342
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,125
with his presence.

343
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,500
This really takes me back.

344
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:39,125
Chief Omna, we're here looking
for environmental changes,

345
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,000
vegetation that's turning black,

346
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,416
monsters running amok
where they shouldn't be.

347
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,666
Have you seen
anything like that?

348
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,666
Yes, and I assume because
you've been sent to our village,

349
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,541
these changes pose
a grave danger to us.

350
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,791
We can't afford to sit
back and do nothing.

351
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,250
It could up-end the
balance of nature!

352
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,416
I'm talking about entire
species of monster

353
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,458
suddenly going extinct!

354
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,708
What do you think
they're talking about?

355
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,041
I dunno, but it
looks pretty heated.

356
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,625
Uh, Lilia?

Hey, are you okay?

00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,541
Yeah, or not.

Hi. I'm fine.
Sorry, I spaced out.

Ah-ha. And what are
you Riders doing here?

you, Miss Simone.

It's an energy drink.

Wow. Not the usual kind
of energy drink I've seen.

[yells]

Oh, Lilia dear,
will you be our guide

377
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,333
when Pappan and I investigate
the woods tomorrow?

00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,625
Yeah! Of course I'll help you!

379
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,833
[LILIA] This area we're going
through now is Mosswine country.

380
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,375
You'll find lots of Blue
Mushrooms all over.

You really know
your surroundings.

382
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,625
I like reading about different
kinds of plants and monsters.

383
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,416
I find that having a
passion for something

384
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,791
is the strongest
force in the world.

385

There's one thing I
don't understand, though.

386
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,541
If most of the children in
your village become Riders,

387
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,791
why aren't you taking
that step, too?

388
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,250
Do you have a different dream?

389
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:37,333
Sorta. I guess.

00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,666
It's okay.

391
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,333
You only need to focus
on being yourself, Lilia.

392

That's what counts.

And they're not the only ones.

our investigation
made good progress.

Simone, is it all right if
I ask you a personal question?

412
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,541
Of course!

413
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,208
What made you decide to join the
Scriveners in the first place?

414
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,458
I often ask myself
the same thing.

415
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,708
Indeed. There's no easy answer.

416
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,708
Believe me, I've traveled
the world trying to settle

417
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,250
on the right one.

418
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,458
In the meantime,

419
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,250
I'll keep filling my
fountain of knowledge.

420

That's the best part
of life on the road.

The paths our lives take open up
when we least expect them to.

422
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:03,083
All we can really do
then is hone our minds
