[NARRATOR]
These youngsters are Riders,

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,875
on a quest to track down
blackened Kinship Ore

3
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:17,458
and stop the Black Blight that's
been spreading across the world.

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,500
Disenchanted and
seeking answers,

5
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,958
Lute underwent an introspective
trial at the Tower of Illusion,

6
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:27,208
ultimately learning what the
power of Kinship really is.

7
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,833
Meanwhile, Cheval had
learned a different lesson.

8
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:32,041
He tossed aside
his Monstie, Rathi,

9
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:35,875
and then turned his back on his
loyal friends Hyoro and Mille.

10
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,250
Alone and embittered,
it looked like Cheval

11
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:42,250
had finally given in and joined
forces with Dr. Manelger.

12
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,500
[DR. MANELGER] Sorry to keep
you waiting, Cheval, my boy!

13
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:49,541
But at last it's ready,
my Mecha Kinship Stone!

14
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:53,041
[NARRATOR] But no! Cheval had
vanished without a trace!

15
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,375
[LUTE]
You sure about this, Navirou?

16
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:57,041
I think we took a wrong turn,
because this doesn't look like

17
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,125
where we're supposed
to meet Lilia.

18
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,791
Never doubt Navirou's
navigational skills.

19
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:02,958
[LUTE]
Are you kidding?

20
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,500
I've doubted it every
day since we met!

21
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,541
Wait.

22
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,958
Why'd you stop?

[grunts]

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,458
Come on, pal. What's going on?

25
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,958
Ever since we got here,

26
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,875
I've had this weird feeling
that someone's following me.

27
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:29,166
No, everyone's eyes
are on Navirou.

28
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,500
Such is the fate of
the world famous!

29

[NAVIROU laughing]

30
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:36,791
[LUTE]
Really?

31
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,291
You're saying
there's not actually

32
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,458
a Kinship Ore on Mount Rhyz?

33
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,500
Sorry, we got it wrong.

34
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,125
It turns out that
the Kinship Ore

35
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,708
lies somewhere in the
shadow of Mount Rhyz.

36
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:50,166
So we have to search in
the Mountain's shadow.

37
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,541
Which means...

38
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:52,625
Means what?

39
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,875
Well, it means we better
get on the road!

[LUTE]
Actually, no, I'm not.

44

All afternoon I haven't been
able to shake the feeling

45
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,958
that I'm being followed.

46
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,000
What? By whom?

47
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,583
Fans who want
Navirou's autograph.

48
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,958
It's hard getting
around when you're

the greatest
adventurer on Earth.

[chuckles nervously]

00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,500
Is there any chance it's Cheval?

No. Cheval, well,
he's on his own path.

Yeah, okay.

Ooh, it's so good!

See, I told you:
Someone's following us!

These donuts are
Navirou's property!

62
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,083
Only Navirou touches
them and no one else!

How long has it been since you

[HYORO]
Two days.

71
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,083
And is that when
you last saw Cheval?

72
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:10,666
Yeah. Can't believe what
he said to us. Jerk.

73
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,833
I still can't believe he
got rid of Rathi like that.

74
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:17,291
I don't understand him anymore,
he's totally different.

Do you think he's joined
forces with Dr. Manelger?

Doubtful.

77
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,041
I think he's probably
just out there

00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,375
fighting the Black
Blight on his own.

Probably.

left him, what's next?

What do you think we should do?

Well, why not go back
home and rest up?

84

It's been a while since
you were there, right?

They'd all be so
happy to see you!

I'm not so sure.

they'd be "disgusted."

just not in the same manner.

Navirou thinks
the big difference

125
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,375
is that one of you
wants to protect

126

wants to destroy.

also been sightings

of Blighted Monsters
in that area's forest.

141

run into Cheval there, too.

Yeah, that's a good point.

that Kinship Ore

infected with the Blight,

According to the Guild,
the Forest of Confusion,

159
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,416
like the Ruins of Redan,

That confirms it then.

318
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,875
The Kinship Ore in this forest

00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,833
is becoming infected
with the Black Blight.

320
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,083
We'd better go find it,
before it's too late.

in the forest to start looking.

Well, then that means it's...

...definitely the
opposite direction.

Huh.

How about we try to follow
all that smudgy stuff

on the trees back to its source?

Wait, Navirou doesn't
think it's that simple.

How can we tell the difference

between the direction
it's coming from

it's going to?

Any ideas?

What direction did
we just come from?

Uh, well...

How are we ever gonna
find the Kinship Ore

How in the world did
you end up here?

I could ask you the same thing.

355
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,791
We heard reports of a
Blighted monster around here,

356
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,791
so we came to check it out.

Why're you back on Lute's team?

Uh, well...

00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,791
I thought you and Mille
were with Cheval.

00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,416
Oh, Genie, we're so sorry.

361
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,916
Going with Cheval
was a big mistake.

362
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,083
We thought we'd be helping
to stop the Blight,

363

but it turns out we were wrong.

364
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,750
So if you're here,
then where's Cheval?

365
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,833
We have no clue. We left him.

Genie. I'm sorry.

367
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,291
I never agreed with
the choice you made.

368
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,375
I only allowed it because
it's more important for you

to choose your own path.
