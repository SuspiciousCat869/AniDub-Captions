1
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:10,958
[NARRATOR] This is Lute,
a young monster Rider!

2
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:13,708
He and his friends have just
defeated a Blighted Diablos

3
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:16,583
and purified a Kinship Ore.

4
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,416
But though Cheval,
Hyoro, and Mille

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,250
have come all
this way with Lute,

6
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:23,416
they've broken off to
follow their own path.

7
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:29,250
The Scriveners just gave
me the good news.

8
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,916
Thanks to you, the Kinship
Ore at Albrachs Village

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,750
is pure once again.

10
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,625
Most impressive work.

11
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,833
You Riders don't disappoint.

12
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,208
Well done!

13
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,875
[LILIA] We all worked
together, Guild Master.

14
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,041
I would assume so,

15
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,916
which is why I've
called you Riders here

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,875
for some important news.

17
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:50,208
But it seems like some
of you are missing.

18
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,666
Yeah, Cheval and the others...

19
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,208
...they decided to...

20
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,000
Instead of returning
to Gildegaran,

21
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,041
they're still fighting
the Black Blight.

22
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,166
[GUILD MASTER]
Hm. I see.

23
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,250
Ahoy, there, Cheval!

24
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,666
Cheval, my boy!

25
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:16,083
Have you given any more thought
to my offer of a partnership?

26
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:19,250
Join with us, and you
can help save the world!

27
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,291
We've no use for either of you.

28
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:24,250
No need to be so cold-hearted,
my young friend.

29
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,791
My young friend.

30
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:28,500
He said it twice
'cause he's sincere!

31
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,625
Leave me alone.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,125
You're making the wrong decision
by turning us down, my boy.

33
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,625
[GUILD MASTER] Have you ever
heard the name "Redan"?

34
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,458
The great Rider, yeah.

35
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:40,833
[GUILD MASTER]
Good, good.

36
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:44,000
But have you ever heard
the stories of his Monstie?

37
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:47,875
No. Although, we have
heard about his Palico.

38
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,375
According to the Redan legend:

39
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,041
"The great Rider soars
gallantly across the heavens

40
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,916
astride a dragon white."

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,916
So it seems to me that
this "dragon white"

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,875
must've been the monster Redan
used to seal the Blight away.

43
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,625
A "dragon white"?

44
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:03,958
That's right.

45
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,416
And since you have
made it your mission

46
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,250
to stop the Blight
as well, Lute,

47
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,875
it stands to reason you'll need
the same Monstie Redan rode.

48
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:14,291
Do you know the kind of
species it was, sir?

49
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,375
I have no clue.

50
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,375
[ALL yelp]

51
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,583
Of course he has no idea.

52
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,375
[GUILD MASTER] And with that,
I've told you Riders all I know.

53
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,541
You're looking for a dragon,
well, a big, white monster,

54
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:25,625
more or less.

55
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,416
Yeah, no surprise there.

56
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,833
Hm. A monster that looks
like a white dragon.

57
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,833
That's pretty vague.

58
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,500
I'll go do some research
at the Scriveners guild.

59
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:37,916
Great, thanks!

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,250
[LILIA]
See ya!

61
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,166
Let's try to find some
clues on our own, too.

62
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,708
What? Do you have a
lead or something?

63
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,041
Well, not yet,

64
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,833
but we might be able to
get one by asking Hunters

65
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,625
if they've ever heard
of a "dragon white."

66
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,333
We'll start with Reverto!

67
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,916
[DEBLI]
Hey-Hey!

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,708
Lute, what's goin' on, my man?

69
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,875
Hey, Tub... bli?

70
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,916
It's Debli! It hasn't
been that long, has it?

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,666
Anyway, I heard you just
finished a whopper of a Quest!

72
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,000
What did you do?
How much did you make?

73
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,083
You bet your thick hide we did!

74
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,375
Thanks to Navirou,
it was a huge win!

75
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:16,375
Sounds great! I wanna
hear all about it!

76
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,750
Here's the scene.

77
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,666
Blighted monsters surrounded
Hunter and Rider alike.

78
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,208
The brave Navirou
arrives in a flash!

79
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,833
Sorry, Debli, but we gotta go.

80
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,166
Not fair!

81
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,416
Are you starting another Quest?
Lemme come along!

82
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,166
It's not a Quest.

83
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,416
We're just asking Hunters

84
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,458
if they've ever heard
of this one monster.

85
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,125
Oh, is that so?

86
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:38,500
Well, maybe the time is right
to introduce you to my teacher.

87
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,125
You have a teacher?

88
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,166
Who taught you to be shady?

89
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,000
Aw, c'mon, I'm not shady!

90
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,500
And on that note...

91
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,958
Hey! Come back and hear me out!

92
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,708
He's no normal teacher, he's a
descendant of a legendary hero!

93
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,041
What?

94
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:57,833
A legendary hero, huh?
What's his name?

95
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,958
Oh, I don't know
the hero's name,

96
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,750
but I do know my
teacher's Nedan!

97
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,583
[BOTH]
Nedan, huh?

00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,875
[NEDAN snoring]

99
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,250
[DEBLI]
Hey-Hey! Teacher!

100
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,958
This is my buddy, Lute.

101
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,208
[NEDAN]
Huh?

102
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,916
Lute, I'd like you to
meet my teacher, Nedan!

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Hey, teach, do you mind if Lute
asks you a question or two?

104
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,333
Depends on the question
this Rider has for me.

105
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:31,125
What? How could you
tell I'm a Rider?

106
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,750
Well, son, your eyes
gave ya square-away

107
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,291
before you even said a word!

108
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,250
A whisperin' wind, they are.

109
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,000
Wait, what?

110
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,083
You can read people that way?

111
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,833
Look into Navirou's eyes next

112
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,375
and tell him what you
can see about him!

113
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,416
[NEDAN]
Hm...

114
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,166
In those big blues, I see...

115
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,000
Glitterin' stars
upon an inky sky!

116
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,791
Great constellations
showin' Riders the way!

117
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh, wow!

118
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:02,291
Navirou's navigational
skills are heaven-sent!

119
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:05,083
Are you descended from
a hero named Redan?

120
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,708
[NEDAN]
Redan?

121
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,875
Yeah. Yeah, old
ancestor of mine.

122
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,458
[LUTE]
The legendary hero?

123
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,791
[NEDAN] Yep. Uh-huh.
Saved the world that one did.

124
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,000
[LUTE] By sealing away
the Black Blight, yes!

125
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,083
[NEDAN]
Sealed it away. Totally sealed!

126
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,750
[LUTE] So, then what do you
know about Kinship Ore?

127
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:25,375
Now, wait a sec. You've
heard about Kinship Ore?

128
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,250
Yeah.

129
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,458
We're traveling the world,

130
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,500
finding and purifying
all the Kinship Ore

131
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,250
tainted by the Black Blight.

132
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,583
Oh, yeah, sure.

133
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,875
Kinship Ore's gotta be
as clean as crystal,

134
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,166
or else it don't "Kinship."

135
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,583
My dear ancestor could've
never saved the world

136

00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,291
[BOTH]
Uh?

138
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,916
His story's been handed
down for generations.

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,083
Oh, wow, sir!

140
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,500
You really do know
a lot about this.

141
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,708
Have you heard of
a "dragon white"?

142
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:51,625
[NEDAN]
Hm?

143
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,541
A dragon white?

144
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,000
Legend says Redan could
only stop the Black Blight

145
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,583
with one as his Monstie.

146
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,125
That means I need
one as my Monstie.

147
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,541
But I need to find a
white dragon egg, first.

148
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,875
[NEDAN]
So that's your deal, huh?

149
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:08,333
The egg of a dragon white
sounds simple enough, I guess.

150
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,750
But do you even know what
kinda Monster that is?

151
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,958
[NAVIROU] Not even Navirou
could figure it out!

152
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,875
That's why we came to you!

153
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,541
You're in luck,
'cause I've seen one!

154
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,125
You have?

155
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,375
[NEDAN] It was back when I was
a wet-behind-the-ears greenhorn

156
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,083
to the whole Huntin' game.

157
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,541
You see, the older Hunters
had taken me along

158
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,958
on a very arduous Quest.

159
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,416

[SIMONE]
Lilia.

161
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:38,041
The Guild Master wants us to
look into something for him.

162
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,791
The name of a monster
that till now

163
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,666
has only appeared in legend
as "the dragon white."

164
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,791
[LILIA]
What a coincidence,

165
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,000
that's exactly what
I was researching!

166
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,791
I'm afraid you won't find
any mention of it in here.

167
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,458
That's why I'm forming
a field research team.

168
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,416
Its only goal will be
to gather information

169
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,000
on the white dragon.

170
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:58,583
I'll be captain of this team.
With Pappan as my lieutenant.

171
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,375
And I've made a special request
for you to join as well.

172
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,750
What? Really?

173
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,958
I'll be working with
you on this mission?

174
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,041
You better go get ready now.

175
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,416
We leave tomorrow.

176
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,166
Right!

177
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,916
And then, the white dragon
flew high into the air.

178
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,291
Higher and higher,
till it was outta sight.

179
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,583
That was not the end
of the peril, however,

180
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,916
as the long trek back to
Gildegaran was even scarier

181
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,458
than the great white beast!

182
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:27,083
But that's a story
for another time.

183
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,041
--C'mon, tell us now!
--Whoa, that's amazing!

184
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:33,333
So then, do you know where I can
find a white dragon egg, sir?

185
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,041
Yeah, let me think on that one.

186
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,625
A while back, I did hear
of a promising spot

187
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,250
that's not too far.

188
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,625
Now, let's think about what
an old-fashioned egg hunt

189
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,750
will set ya back in
the Zenny department.

190
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,333
Lotta supplies.

191
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,708
The hunt'll cost
ya 10,000 Zenny.

192
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,375
You like the sight of that?

193
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,416
Ten what?! Think about
all the donuts that'd buy!

194
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,583
All right, fine!

195
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,250
You're gonna pay?

196
00:09:56,333 --> 00:10:00,375
[NEDAN] Hm. In advance,
if you don't mind.

197
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,041
Now hold on there, Lute.

198
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,291
It's custom to only
pay a deposit up front

199
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,833
and the remainder upon
completion of said task!

200
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,708
Do they give you Quest rewards
before or after you're done?

201
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,500
Uh. Good point.

202
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,666
[NEDAN]
Hm.

203
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,125
Son, I apologize.
Your friend is right.

204
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,708
That there's one good Rider's
Palico you got by your side.

205
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,916
What? Well, Navirou
wouldn't go that far.

206
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,750
[NEDAN]
I'll take 5,000 as a deposit.

207
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,000
Fine! You strike a
hard bargain, sir!

208
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,041
[LUTE]
Here ya go!

209
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,208
[NEDAN] Let's meet here.
Tomorrow morning.

210
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,125

[BOTH gasp]

214
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,791
Wow, the Blight had a major
effect on that Tigrex.

215
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,083
He was on a rampage.

216
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,333
Yeah. I've never seen
one so violent.

217
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:24,291
That's why the only option
left is to defeat them.

218
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,500
C'mon. There're plenty
more out there.

219
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,666
Shouldn't we maybe take
a break, Cheval?

220
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,375
Aren't you hungry?

221
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,875
There's still daylight
left. Let's go.

222
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,708

[DEBLI]
Teacher! We're all ready!

227
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,000
Wake up!

228
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,083
[LUTE] Mister Nedan,
did you remember the spot

229
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,208
where the egg is?

230
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,083
Yup. It all came back.

231
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,333
That's great!

232
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,500
Yeah, I feel good
about this spot.

233
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,458
But the hard part's gonna
be gettin' over there

234
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,625
in the first place.

235
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,666
Don't worry about us,
we can handle it!

236
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,666
[NEDAN]
Hmm...

237
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,666

Horn, have ya?

240
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,583
She's a beauty.

241

Can't wait to take this
here Phenomenal Phlute

out for a swing once more!

You're so amazing!

244
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,958
Eh. I don't know
about "amazing."

245
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,541
Don't doubt my greatness, boy!

246
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,250
You have no idea how
many Zamtrios I defeated

247
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,666
just to get my
hands on this baby.

248

Years later and I still
wake up in horror

their big fat bodies

and those freezing attacks!

What do ya see out there, sir?

255
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,333
Is it a monster?

256
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,625
Say, could one of
ya go poke around

257
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,541
in that grass over yonder?

258
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,916
[LUTE, DEBLI, NAVIROU]

263
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:09,916
That's right!

264
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,791
And there'll be even more
items for us up ahead!

265
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,250
We'll fill our pockets!

266
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,041
[NAVIROU]
Ooh! Here's some more!

267
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,625
[LUTE]
Yeah! Nulberries!

268
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,000
[NEDAN] One of you check
out that thicket, too.

269
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:25,291
[DEBLI] Uh, but, Teacher,
I can't carry anymore!

270
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,000
[NEDAN] Well, we finally made
it to the white dragon's lair!

271
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:32,875
Now ya just gotta crawl on in,
find its nest, and grab an egg!

272
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,791
In there, huh?

273
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,458
Hold on, Lute!

274
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,625
What for?

275
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,583
It's great that we found
the dragon's lair,

276
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,208
but shouldn't we assume that
the dragon is there, too?

277
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,583
Navirou doesn't
wanna be eaten today!

278
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,166
Don't be scared.
Mr. Nedan's with us.

279
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,375
Ayup!

280
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,125
That's a Rider's Palico
if ever I heard one.

281
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,916
You're Navirou, that right?

282
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,125
Huh?

283
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,000
When you're egg-huntin'
around big monsters,

284
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,791
you can never be too careful.

285
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,333
You're doin' the right thing

286
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:02,208
tryin' to keep your Rider friend
all cautious-like and safe.

287
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,708
Aw!

288
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:07,083
Yeah, Navirou is a super guy.

289
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,583
For you.

290
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,625
A small token of Navirou's
gratitude for your appreciation.

291
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,583
[NEDAN]
Ooh! Thank you much.

292
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,166
At this time of day,

293
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,458
the white dragon will be out and
about huntin' for its own grub.

294
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,958
And with this wind blowin'
something fierce,

295
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,708
I doubt it's back soon.

00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:27,625

rock 'fore we go any further.

[DEBLI] We're stuffed! We don't
have room for more items, sir!

[LUTE]
Yeah, let's just get the egg.

warm up his Huntin' Horn!

00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,166
Are you done yet?!

318
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,916
Are you done yet?!
Are you done yet?!

319
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,666
Hang on! I'm almost ready!

320
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,125
Make it snappy!

321
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,375
Now, Ratha! Fire!

322
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,250
Yeah!

323
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,708
Aw, and just like that,
it's all over.

324
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,166
I was just about to
make my big move, too.

325
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,500
Can we stay here and rest a bit?

326
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,958
That's the most
Navirou's ever run.

327
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,500
You are one powerful
boy, if I do say so.

328
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,333
As quick as lightning you were!

329
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,166
[LUTE]
Huh? Ha-ha. Thanks.

330
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,583
You should be able to find that
egg on your own, no problem.

331
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:20,125
I'll double back to the mouth of
the cave and stand guard for us.

332
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,625
Never know when we might
run into another Nerscylla,

333
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,166
or if the white dragon
is gonna come home.

334
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,583
[LUTE] Are you sure
you'll be okay alone?

335
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,958
Aw, you don't have to
worry about me, son.

336
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,250
I'll be fine.

337
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,333
My teacher's so cool!

338
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,083
Yeah! He really is so cool!

339
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,416
You'll know the dragon egg
as soon as you see it.

340
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,875
It's as white as snow
on a moonlit night.

341
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,833
I'm positive it's right
up ahead. Well, bye!

342
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,916
[NEDAN]
Good luck, fellers!

343
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:03,208
Whoa.

344
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,083
Is that it?

345
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,875
[NAVIROU]
It's white, all right.

346
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,583
[LUTE]
We found it!

347
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,750
The fabled egg of
the dragon white.

348
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,583
Let's get this bad boy hatched!

349
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,375
Here goes!

350
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,666
O holy Kinship Stone.

351
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,083
Please bind me together with
this slumbering creature.

352
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,583

[LUTE]
A Khezu?

357
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,791
[DEBLI]
Did we get the wrong egg?

358
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,208
[NAVIROU] It's painted
white! We've been had!

359
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:47,333
No! How could my
teacher do this to us?

360
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:50,208
Your teacher is not a great
man, he's just a con artist!

361
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,958
Navirou wishes he'd never
given that trickster his donut!

362
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,291
Navirou wants it back!

363
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,583
[LUTE]
Stop right there!

364
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,416
How dare you try to con us!

365
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,916
What? Ya already hatched it?

366
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,291
How'd ya do that?

00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,500
[NAVIROU]
Don't underestimate Riders!

368
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,541
[LUTE]
This is a Khezu egg!

369
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,625
Sorry, but there just ain't
white dragons around here.

370
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,166
And if there are,

371
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,458
you certainly ain't gonna find
'em on one little day trip.

372
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:20,625
[LUTE]
What?

373
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:21,666
[NAVIROU] So you thought
you could pass off

374
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,000
a random Khezu egg?

375
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,250
[NEDAN] Hey, findin' that
wasn't easy, either!

376
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,791
[NAVIROU] And then you literally
just painted it white?

377
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,583
[NEDAN] Well, yeah, it had
to look the part, right?

378
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,500
[NAVIROU] Then, before we even
left on this wild dragon chase,

379
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,166
you hid it in a
Nerscylla's cave?

380
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,333
Sure looked and felt
like the kinda place

381
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,083
where a white dragon
might live, didn't it?

382
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,333
And all the items we
found on our way up here

383
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,208
were planted by you ahead
of time, weren't they?

384
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,416
Oh, no, I didn't
work that hard.

385
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,166
I saw them on my
way home last night

386
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,333
and thought I'd point 'em out.

387
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,750
Well, now you've
confessed everything!

388
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,833
Master detective Navirou
will never be fooled again!

389
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:59,375
You're the bad guy here.
Give us our money back!

390
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,875
Yeah, but your money is...

391
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:03,500
...gone.

392
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,916
What?!

393
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,958
Gone where?

394
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,583
It all went into
expenses for today.

395
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:12,291
Since when does a Khezu
egg cost 5,000 Zenny?

396
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,500
[NEDAN] A guy I owed money to
had taken this baby from me.

397
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,000
Cost me the 5,000
to get it back.

398
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,583
But you'll get your money back.

399
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,083
Now that I got the
ol' Huntin' Horn,

400
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,625
I can do all sorts of work.

401
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,000
You just watch me!

402
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,750
Why should we believe that?

403
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,458
Navirou will never
forgive himself

404
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,583
for trusting 5,000 Zenny
to this donut thief!

405
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,291
Wait, Mister Nedan.

406
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,541
What makes you so sure

407
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,541
there aren't any white
dragons in this area?

408
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,416
[NEDAN]
Hmm...

409
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,166
"The Rider soars gallantly
across the heavens

410
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,125
astride a dragon white."

411
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:48,250
What? The Guild Master
said the same thing.

412
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,500
[NEDAN]
Not surprised.

413
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,125
That tale's been handed
down for generations.

414
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,541
But since no one seems to know

415
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,583
what Monster a
"dragon white" is,

416
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,250
stands to reason folks have
never really seen one!

417
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,125
So then if it is real,
and if it is still alive,

418
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,583
I'm betting it probably lives
way, way far away from everyone.

419
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,541
[LUTE] Mister, are you really
descended from Redan?

420
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,250
[NEDAN] I wouldn't know all
this stuff if I wasn't!

421
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,791
If you're one of
his descendants,

422
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,166
why are you a
shifty junk dealer?

423
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,416
Well, look,

424
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,333
sure, I'm a descendant
of the legendary Redan,

425
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,375
but that don't mean
I get an inheritance,

426
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,666
'specially not if
I'm no Rider myself!

427
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,833
I live my life. So what's
wrong with that?

428
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,916
When you put it that way,
it doesn't seem so bad.

I never lose sight of a debt.

fabled "dragon white."

<i>Monstie Manual</i> !

472
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,333
Here comes the part
where Navirou

473
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:39,875
tells you about Monsties.

474
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,875
All right, Navirou
hopes you have

475
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:44,083
your Media Trigger
Smart Phone app open.

476
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,541
Better get your eggs out,
too, while you're at it!

477
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:51,666
And now, it's time to form
a Kinship with our Monsties!

478
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,791
The moment of new life!

479
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:56,125
Awaken!

480
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:02,416
[NAVIROU] Our Monstie
this time is: Zamtrios!

481
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,000
Also known as "Monster Sharks,"

482
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:07,000
these amphibians are at home
on land or in the water!

483
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,875
They have the power to encase
their whole bodies in ice armor

484
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:12,000
and can blow themselves
up like a huge balloon

485
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:13,916
to crush their enemies!

486
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Navirou can't wait to see what
monster hatches next time!

487
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,625
[LUTE]
Hey, guys, Lute here!

488
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:22,166
We finally made it to
the Dovan Volcano!

489
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,750
Navirou, what's going on?

490
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:26,875
This is so weird! Why're
you all electrified now?

491
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,583
Next Time:
"Dovan Volcano Memories."

492
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,166
Ride On!
