This young boy's name is Lute,

a rash but enthusiastic fellow,

Lute and his friends have
come to the Dovan Volcano

in search of a Kinship Ore.

They successfully took down
a mechanized Uragaan,

No luck.

'cause you're so used to the

[NAVIROU yelps]

I'm so glad to see
you again, at last!

34
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:28,291
I always believed that you
would come back to us someday.

35
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:33,333
And who exactly are you?
Navirou's never met you.

36
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,166
But don't you recognize
me, Number Five?

37
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm Number Six, Floof.

38
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:43,666
Have you forgotten the Kinship
that we Numbers all share?

39
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,750
Did you say "Numbers"?

40
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,791
It's just like I told ya, buddy,
I'm yer old friend Beats.

41
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:52,000
Number One of the Numbers.
And you're Number Five.

42
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,291
Y'know, now that you mention it,

43
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,416
this odd Felyne back
at Pawpad Place

44
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,791
kept saying something similar.

45
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,000
Uh.

46
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,416
What's wrong, Navirou?

47
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,500
Navirou's so close to
remembering something...

48
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:08,791
...but he just can't!

49
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,333
Gah! What's happening?

50
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,333
Must be a severe
sugar deficiency!

51
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,333
Donuts! Need donuts!

52
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,625
Of all the times for Navirou
to have no donuts,

53
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,083
and no future.

54
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,250
I see you still love your
donuts as much as ever, huh?

55
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,958
Oh yeah, Number Five is the same
old Number Five he always was!

56
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,000
Navirou is Navirou.

57
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,125
But if somebody likes donuts,
how bad can they be?

58
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:35,166
This Number Five fella
must be a pretty swell guy.

59
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,666
He is, he is!

60
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,166
He's always looking out for
his friends, no matter what.

61
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,833
His friends, huh?

62
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,583
Once you see all of
the others' faces,

63
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,000
I just know that you're gonna
remember us Numbers.

64
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,375
All right, this way, please!

65
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,791
[FLOOF] This underground
facility we're in

66
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,041
is the lowest level of
Dr. Mainelger's laboratory.

67
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,416
He used to use it for all
kinds of crazy expewiments,

68
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,500
but now it's just one
big stinky trash dump.

69
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,458
[LUTE]
What is this place?

70
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,916
[FLOOF] The factory where Dr.
Manelger creates his inventions.

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,208
[DEBLI]
Whoa, inventions?

72
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,458
Jackpot! Must be
tons of loot here!

73
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,041
[LUTE]
And who are they?

74
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,625
[FLOOF] These Felynes were all
brought here against their will

75
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,708
and now they're forced
to do hard labor.

76
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,500
It's very sad.

77
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:24,666
Forced to work? No way!
That's unforgivable!

78
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,083
Us Numbers were all
forced to work here, too,

79
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,916
back when we were first
brought to this place.

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,125
But then one day, we got
dragged off to the laboratory.

81
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,333
[FLOOF]
Strange powers began to awaken

82
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:41,583
within our poked and prodded
and experimented-on bodies.

83
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,500
And since we weren't of any use
to them anymore as failures,

84
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:48,125
we got tossed into that
big smelly trash dump.

85
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,791
Wait, what kind of strange
powers are you talking about?

86
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,375
I can put everybody to sleep

87
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,875
with just one little
puff of my breath.

88

There's careless,
then there's careless.

93
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,416
Oh, man, I can't
stop petting him.

94
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,458
I'm petting him so much right
now! Oh, wow! This is nuts!

Oh, goodness!

96
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,583
Did I drift off
to sleep just now?

97
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:23,375
Oh, bother, not again.
This keeps happening to me.

98
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,000
Who needs this
dumb power, anyway?

99
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,458
[NAVIROU]
Hmm...

100
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,958
[DEBLI] Hey, so Navirou's
zappy-paw thing,

101
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,875
is that a Numbers power, too?

102
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:38,416
[FLOOF] Each of us Numbers has a
different power of our very own.

103
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,708
So why'd you hold out on us
for so long then, Navirou?

104
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,833
Did you forget about
your old power, too?

105
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,791
No, something happened
to trigger that power once,

106
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,625
before we ever met each other.

107
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,666
And Navirou remembered
it all too well.

108
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,833
Even though... a power like
that is better left forgotten.

109
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,583
Yeah, why's that?

110
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,083
Well, 'cause it's scary!

111
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:02,541
What? Scary? No, it's awesome!

112
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,458
I mean, you and me, we've known
each other for a while now,

113
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:08,250
and that was easily the
coolest thing you've done!

114
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,958
Not to mention you
saved me with it!

115

You can look up to Navirou, the
ultimate in cool, all you want!

After all, why wouldn't you?

great at navigation

despite getting lost
all the time thing.

122

Then there's your
cocky attitude,

00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,583
the gluttony, the talking
in third person.

Yes, Navirou offers
so much to admire.

Uh, pretty sure those weren't
meant as compliments.

Well, I know I've always
been a geat admirer

of Number Five's perpetually
positive outlook on life.

Just look at all
these Navirou fans!

Oh! Navirou remembers!

No, no, no, no.

You just came up
with the idea for it.

00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,583
You know, like a producer.

Number Four's the one who
actually designed it.

Ahem. Meow!

But what did you
build this thing for?

So that we could finally put our
big plan into action, of course.

00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,333
What plan?

333
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:26,541
Our plan to break out and spring
everybody from this awful lab.

That is our most ardent wish.

We share our joys
and our sorrows.

There are six Numbers,
and we are all one.

When we break outta here,
we're doing it together!

It must need more energy!

355

So then, it failed before.

to get it up and running.

found anything.

all this time, and yet...

...and yet he just moved on
and forgot all about you!

even bring back the energy
