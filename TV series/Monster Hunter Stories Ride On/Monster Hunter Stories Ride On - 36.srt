00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,166
and give him some help here?

158
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,166
No way! Y'mean to tell
me that pipsqueak there

159
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,875
is the brave Rider who
slayed the Blighted Diablos?

160
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,750
Yup. That's what I said.

161
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,250
That's right!

162
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,791
You guys are looking at the
savior of Albrachs Village.

163
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,666
Sir Lute the Rider!

164
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,375
[HUNTERS gasp]

165
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,125
[VIM grunts]
A Rider.

166
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,458
[NAVIROU]
And then of course,

167
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:12,291
there's his brilliant mentor,
Navirou the Great!

168
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,708
[HUNTERS gasp]

169
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:15,916
[LUTE gasps]

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,750
Wow, you're the one who
slayed the Diablos?

171
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,250
You're amazin', kid!
A real hero, y'know that!

172
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,708
[MHUNTER B] Hey, tell us
some more about the Riders!

173
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,583
[LUTE]
Uh... Uh... sure!

174
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:30,125
That's right, folks, line up
to shake the hero's hand! Huh?

175
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,041
Hey, wait! No cuts!

176
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,958
[NAVIROU grunts]

177
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,958
Uh, hey there.

178
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,125
[VIM grunts]

179
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,291
[LUTE] Oh. That thing!
It's a Kinship Stone.

180
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:49,208
See, 'cause it's used to
form Kinship with monsters!

181
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:52,458
So this is a Kinship Stone?

182
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,250
Yeah, um...

183
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:56,958
[VIM]
Hm?

184
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,333
All right, pal, that's enough.

185
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,041
[VIM]
Hmph.

186
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,583
Are you okay, Lute?

187
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,625
That guy is crazy strong.

188
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:14,375
[ELKE]
Master Vim, wait for me!

189
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,125
[LUTE]
Sheesh, what was that about?

190
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,125
Beats me.

191
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,291
Hey, so, Mr. Reverto.

192
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,416
[REVERTO]
Huh?

193
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,458
There's something
that I'd like to ask

194
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,250
all the Hunters who
are here. May I?

195
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,958
[REVERTO]
Oh, that's right.

196
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:31,250
Hey, guys! I want everyone
to pay attention!

197
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,000
If any of you have seen
Doctor Manelger's airship

198
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,500
flying around here,
please let us know.

199
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:40,125
Wait, Manelger? The guy
who mechanizes monsters?

200
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,250
Oh! Hey, you know,
now that you mention it,

201
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,458
I did see an airship like
that a few days back,

202
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,250
near the Treese Salt Caves.

203
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,375
[BOTH]
Huh?

204
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,083
All right, tell us
everything you know!

205
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,333
[NAVIROU grunts]

206
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,833
Navirou's got sand in his fur!

207
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,625
[LUTE]
Then put on some clothes.

208
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:03,958
No can do!

209
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,750
Navirou believes
strongly in presenting

210
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,708
his true and honest
self to the world!

211
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,416
Sand in Navirou's eyes
and sand in his mouth!

212
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,833
[REVERTO]
Forget about that.

213
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,666
The Trese Salt Caves
where the airship

214
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,750
was spotted are just ahead.
Let's keep moving.

215
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,333
[LUTE] Hey, you really helped
us out back there, Mister.

216
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,916
And now you're
showing us the way?

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,750
[REVERTO] Don't mention it.
That was all you, really.

218
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:32,041
I mean, you are the hero
who saved Albrachs Village.

219
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,500
But you know, there is something
that's been bothering me.

220
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,000
[LUTE]
Really? What?

221
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:37,958
[REVERTO]
Back in that tavern--

222
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:38,958
[NAVIROU shouts]

223
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,000
[LUTE]
What is it?

224
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,375
That's-That's-That's...
the airship!

225
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,875
[LUTE]
It sure is!

226
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,666
Oh yeah, that's Manelger's
ship all right!

227
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,208
[REVERTO] Can't see too
well at this distance.

228
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,750
[LUTE]
It's landing at the Salt Caves!

229
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,833
[LILIA sighs]

230
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,833
Look! This report's
about Dr. Manelger!

231
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:00,958
[LILIA]
Huh?

232
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:07,041
You're right! And this intel
is pretty recent, too!

233
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,333
But wait, hold on, this doesn't
mention the Trese Desert at all.

234
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:13,583
[PAPPAN] Ooh, I found
another report in here.

235
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,833
Oh, wow, these are
confirmed sightings

236
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,125
of someone matching
Manelger's description!

237
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,875
From very reliable sources!

238
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,500
Mm? But, these don't come from
the Trese Desert, either.

239
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,208
What? That means...

240
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,750
...the info that we gave
Lute and Navirou--

241
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,375
It must have been bogus intel.

242
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:34,125
[LILIA] If so, then what was
it that all those people

243
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,208
mistook for the airship?

244
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,625
Good news, Master Vim.

245
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,833
It looks like this little
replica of an airship

246
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,125
is bringing them right to us.

247

Save Navirou!

Don't move! I'm on my way!

[REVERTO]
Be careful!

254
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,875
Lute, help!

255
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,208
Are you okay?

00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,958
Oh, Lute!

[LUTE chuckles]

258
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:18,625
As expected of
Navirou's top pupil!

Where am I?

Where's Navirou?

--[NAVIROU grunts]
--[LUTE gasps]

271
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:07,500
[groans] Oh, Navirou couldn't
possibly eat that much.

272
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,625
But when there are
donuts in sight,

273
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,333
Navirou will be sure
to eat every last bite!

274
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,458
And that is a Navi-rule.

275
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:18,208
[gasps]
Hey! Where'd all the donuts go?

They were right
here a second ago...!

the bottom of the crevasse.

279
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,625
[NAVIROU]
So it was connected to a cave!

280
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,583
C'mon, we've gotta look
for a way outta here

281
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,125
so we can find Manelger.

Uh? What's that sound?

00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,208

[buzzing continues]

287
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,125

Sounds like wings flapping!

A swarm of Bnahabra!

Ah, the fleet-footed

00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,333
Yes, yes, an excellent choice!

Hey, wait. Where is it?

294
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,375
Think maybe it's because
we're in a cave?

295
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,250
Perhaps your Monstie
is lost, too.

296
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,500
That's not good.

297
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,750
So what now?

00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,250

Don't talk, just run!

00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,541
Navirou's too hungry to fight.

00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,791
[NAVIROU] Oh, no. While we were
talking, they surrounded us!

Thanks, sir. You saved us.

Hey! What are you
doing to Lute?

327
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:14,000
[ELKE shouts]
Mew stay out of this.

328
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,791
Sure are mouthy,

Just who are you, anyway?

00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:22,333
[ELKE chuckes]
My name's Elke.

331
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,708
We only buttered mew up
and saved mew to get mew

332
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,541
to drop your guard, mrowr!

333
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,916
[LUTE]
Why are you doing this?

334
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,833
[VIM]
I'll be taking that.

335
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:35,708
[gasps]
Hey! Stop it!

336
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,333
[ELKE] We're just trying to
complete our quest here, mrowr.

337
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,041
There's no way it's a quest!

338
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,458
The Guild would
never order this!

339
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:45,666
Oh, did I say anything about
it being a Guild quest?

340
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,791
No, this is a
black-market quest!

341
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,250
Black-market?
What does that mean?

342
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,083
That means it's an illegal
quest bypassing the Guild.

343
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,791
It's risky, but the
rewards are better

344
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,708
than anything the
Guild hands out.

345
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,458
This one happens to be
for some fancy doctor guy,

346
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,083
and he's paying really well!

347
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,500
[NAVIROU]
It's not Dr. Manelger, is it?

00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,500
[ELKE] Huh, that name
does ring a bell, mrowr.

349
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,708
Anyway, it's 10,000
Zenny just to fly

350
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,500
an airship-shaped kite
and trick the Scriveners!

351
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,166
Plus another hundred thousand

352
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,750
if we get that Kinship Stone
off of mew and bring it to him!

353
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,125
Manelger would really
sink that low?

354
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:22,083
All I know is we're gonna make
a fortune thanks to mew!

Huh? Sorry, Master Vim!

357
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,291
I just got a little
carried away, mrowr!

358
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:37,125
It's time. Form Kinship with
this legendary Monstie, Cheval!

359
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:41,916
O holy Kinship Stone,
bind the two of us together.

360
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Now the moment of
new life. Awaken!

361
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,666
O dragon white,
please be my Monstie!

362
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,791
[CHEVAL] What is the
meaning of this Manelger?

363
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,250
[DR. MANELGER]
As I suspected.

364
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:02,291
This Kinship Stone
lacks sufficient power.

365
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,458
The power necessary to
awaken the white dragon.

366
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,833
Don't touch it!

367
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:10,833
You expect me to believe
that it's not strong enough?

Who's there?

00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,541
[REVERTO] You know, you're a
downright despicable dude,

380
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:46,750
rogue hunter. For such a big
guy, you certainly act small.

381
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:51,166
[LUTE grunts]
Hey, Mister!

382
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,916
Don't think I'm
letting you off easy.

383
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,083
[VIM] Hm. A Hunter turning his
sword on another human

384
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,333
is forbidden.

385
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,875
Yeah, that's right, mrowr!

386
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,666
And if you violate
the Hunter's rules,

387
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,041
you'll be kicked
out of the Guild,

388
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:06,375
only to become a
rogue Hunter yourself!

389
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:10,541
[REVERTO] And throw in
with you lot? No, thanks.

[LUTE]
Huh? Uh, hey, Mister?

391
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,541
[REVERTO] A sword would be
wasted on the likes of you.

It was nothing.

410
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,541
Seriously, I wanted
to punch that guy

411
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:41,500
from the moment I first saw him.
By the way, did you always have

412
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,541
that special lightning
move, Navirou?

413

Yes, well, Navirou's
a very special guy.

You wanna see it again?

Yeah, no, I'm good.

shall we head on back now?

Sure was. And we wasted the
whole day chasing down

424

a fake Manelger lead.

425
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,666
Well, now to take it easy.

[NAVIROU]
<i>Monstie Manual</i> !

432
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,791
Here comes the part
where Navirou tells you

433
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,166
about Monsties.

434
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,791
All right, Navirou hopes you

[NAVIROU] Our Monstie
this time is: Ahpceros!

441
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:04,375
This compact monster
lives out in the desert.

442
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:06,291
It's an herbivore like Aptonoth,

443
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:08,458
but still packs
a powerful punch!

And with its tough exterior,

445
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,166
this is one Monstie
who'll keep you safe
