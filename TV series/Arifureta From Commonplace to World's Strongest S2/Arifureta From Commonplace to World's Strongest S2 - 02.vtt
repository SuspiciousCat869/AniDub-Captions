00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.576 position:50% align:center
They've analyzed
the water in the oasis

And they've studied
the groundwater veins.

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:12.335 position:50% align:center
But they haven't explored
the bottom of the oasis itself.

Who cares what it is?

It's the thing causing
all the pollution.

I'm willing to bet that it
has some sort of special

00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:00.053 position:50% align:center
I've had about
enough of your bull!

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.390 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:12:11.523 --> 00:12:12.691 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:14.734 position:50% align:center
Hajime, this new
feature is so powerful

00:12:14.818 --> 00:12:16.736 position:50% align:center
it actually scares me a little.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.363 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Seems that way.

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:21.449 position:50% align:center
I wasn't sure it'd work,
but now you can convert mana

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:22.867 position:50% align:center
into kinetic energy.

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:29.124 position:50% align:center
Well, that's an
impressive sight.

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:30.333 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
Uh-huh.

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:32.752 position:50% align:center
Who could've imagined
such a place?

00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:35.088 position:50% align:center
Now that we have access
to this much stillstone,

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:37.549 position:50% align:center
we can definitely save
the people of Ankaji!

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:38.758 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:40.135 position:50% align:center
Now we just have to
get through the giant,

00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:42.053 position:50% align:center
daunting labyrinth, no biggie.

00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:56.317 position:50% align:center
Ugh. It's so hot down here.

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:59.571 position:50% align:center
[YUE] Shea, it's not that hot,
it's all in your head.

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:02.323 position:50% align:center
All that flowy stuff
around is just water!

00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:04.284 position:50% align:center
Look, so refreshing.

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:07.454 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, Master!

00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:09.748 position:50% align:center
Yue is fading--
we must do something!

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:12.250 position:50% align:center
You seem fine. Must be nice.

00:13:12.334 --> 00:13:14.085 position:50% align:center
I guess we'd better
take a break.

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:25.388 position:50% align:center
All right, Yue, make us
a big block of ice.

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:28.850 position:50% align:center
This heat is frying our brains
right out of our skulls.

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:30.018 position:50% align:center
As you wish.

00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:38.818 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. That feels so cool.

00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:40.570 position:50% align:center
We were starting to get cooked.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.533 position:50% align:center
You can go ahead
and relax for a bit,

00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:47.410 position:50% align:center
but don't forget to
wipe off your sweat.

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:49.454 position:50% align:center
If you get too cold,
you'll stiffen up.

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:50.497 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
Uh-huh.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.374 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
Oh, that makes sense.

00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:54.834 position:50% align:center
Wow, Master, you seem
surprisingly relaxed.

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:56.544 position:50% align:center
I'm just playing it cool.

00:13:56.628 --> 00:13:58.713 position:50% align:center
This heat is worse
than I thought.

00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:00.256 position:50% align:center
We could really do with
some air conditioning

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.384 position:50% align:center
artifacts right about now.

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:05.887 position:50% align:center
Huh. If it's having that
effect on you, Master,

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.348 position:50% align:center
then perhaps we've identified
the concept behind

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:09.683 position:50% align:center
this labyrinth.

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:11.518 position:50% align:center
--The concept?
--[TIO] That's right.

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:13.311 position:50% align:center
The Great Labyrinths are
designed to test those

00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:15.397 position:50% align:center
who seek to fight God, correct?

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.399 position:50% align:center
Then it follows that
perhaps they each have

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:20.110 position:50% align:center
a unique testing concept.

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:23.071 position:50% align:center
For example, the Great
Orcus Labyrinth is designed

00:14:23.154 --> 00:14:25.073 position:50% align:center
to make you fight
various monsters and gain

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:27.242 position:50% align:center
valuable combat experience.

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:31.830 position:50% align:center
The Great Reisen Labyrinth
tested your ability

00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:34.374 position:50% align:center
to respond to all types of
attacks without the help

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:37.669 position:50% align:center
of mana, which is
an important power.

00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:40.255 position:50% align:center
I hypothesize that the
Grand Gruen Volcano

00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:42.340 position:50% align:center
is a test to see if you
can maintain focus

00:14:42.424 --> 00:14:44.426 position:50% align:center
in extreme conditions
like this heat

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:47.220 position:50% align:center
and respond to ambushes
and surprise attacks.

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:48.430 position:50% align:center
Interesting thought.

00:14:48.513 --> 00:14:50.432 position:50% align:center
It never even occurred
to me, honestly.

00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:52.517 position:50% align:center
It makes me wonder if
maybe the tests themselves

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.729 position:50% align:center
could be the teachings
of the Liberators, or um...

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:10.744 position:50% align:center
Wanna come wipe me down, Hajime?

00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:23.381 position:50% align:center
This is like an amusement
park ride through hell.

00:15:29.512 --> 00:15:31.765 position:50% align:center
Look, Hajime, there's
another tunnel up there.

00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:34.976 position:50% align:center
Altitude-wise, I think
we're around base level.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:36.811 position:50% align:center
This could be something.

00:15:36.895 --> 00:15:38.021 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:46.988 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Hold on!

00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:58.708 position:50% align:center
Updraft.

00:16:14.766 --> 00:16:17.102 position:50% align:center
Looks like there are gems
embedded in the walls.

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:18.812 position:50% align:center
Assuming there are
some we can't see,

00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:21.856 position:50% align:center
I bet there are about
a hundred gems total.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.359 position:50% align:center
Do you think that could
be the Liberators' hideout?

00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:25.819 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Given the depth of where we are,

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:28.113 position:50% align:center
and the general look
of it, could be.

00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:29.989 position:50% align:center
But that means we
may have company.

00:16:30.073 --> 00:16:33.326 position:50% align:center
You mean the final guardian
could be here, too, correct?

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.537 position:50% align:center
The lava river did seem
like a bit of a shortcut

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.122 position:50% align:center
right to this place, though.

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:40.542 position:50% align:center
So maybe we just skipped past
the final guardian altogether!

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:46.756 position:50% align:center
I've got this one!

00:17:03.398 --> 00:17:04.858 position:50% align:center
Spatial Severance.

00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:10.655 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Yue, I'll check out that island.

00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:11.906 position:50% align:center
Cover me, 'kay?

00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:22.584 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Mana crystals?

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:34.679 position:50% align:center
Jeez, what a pain.

00:17:34.763 --> 00:17:36.181 position:50% align:center
How many of these
things are there?

00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:37.349 position:50% align:center
Hajime, you okay?

00:17:37.432 --> 00:17:39.267 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, never been better.

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:41.853 position:50% align:center
Well, we definitely didn't
bypass the final guardian.

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:53.323 position:50% align:center
[TIO] I think it's safe
to assume that island

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:54.783 position:50% align:center
is the goal here.

00:17:54.866 --> 00:17:56.534 position:50% align:center
Those snakes might
as well be daring us

00:17:56.618 --> 00:17:58.411 position:50% align:center
to defeat them
in order to get there.

00:17:58.495 --> 00:18:01.331 position:50% align:center
For sure, but they all just
regenerated, right?

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:03.291 position:50% align:center
How can we take them down?

00:18:03.375 --> 00:18:04.626 position:50% align:center
Ya know,

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:06.628 position:50% align:center
these things are like that
lovely bachulum monster

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:08.380 position:50% align:center
we fought back in Ankaji.

00:18:08.463 --> 00:18:11.341 position:50% align:center
Yes. They should have
a core, a mana crystal,

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:12.926 position:50% align:center
somewhere in their bodies.

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:14.427 position:50% align:center
It shapes the lava.

00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:16.054 position:50% align:center
There's too much
of it in the way,

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:18.556 position:50% align:center
not even my demon eye
can pinpoint their location.

00:18:20.642 --> 00:18:22.477 position:50% align:center
We'll just have to
blast them all apart.

00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:33.279 position:50% align:center
I'm not just packing normal
rounds here, buddy.

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:40.286 position:50% align:center
Now say goodnight.

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:44.457 position:50% align:center
I get it!

00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:47.293 position:50% align:center
So, that's the way to
beat these guardians!

00:18:47.377 --> 00:18:49.713 position:50% align:center
Well then, no use
standing idly by.

00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:53.550 position:50% align:center
Dark Sphere.

00:18:57.429 --> 00:18:59.264 position:50% align:center
[SHEA yells]

00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:00.640 position:50% align:center
Take that!

00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:32.213 position:50% align:center
Wait, what's going on?

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:34.883 position:50% align:center
I know for a fact that the mana
crystals were shattered.

00:19:34.966 --> 00:19:36.801 position:50% align:center
Isn't defeating those
ten snakes the goal,

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:38.345 position:50% align:center
or could it be something else?

00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:39.721 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
Hajime!

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:42.307 position:50% align:center
Those gems over there,
it looks like they're broken!

00:19:56.738 --> 00:19:59.783 position:50% align:center
I see, that makes 11
broken gems so far.

00:19:59.866 --> 00:20:02.077 position:50% align:center
And that directly corresponds
to the number of snakes

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.204 position:50% align:center
we've dispatched so far, too.

00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:05.580 position:50% align:center
Now we're talking.

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:08.416 position:50% align:center
So, if we kill them all,
then it breaks all the gems.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.752 position:50% align:center
But that means we've got
a lot of giant-lava-snake

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:12.837 position:50% align:center
fighting ahead of us.

00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:15.590 position:50% align:center
Battling these guys in
this heat won't be easy,

00:20:15.674 --> 00:20:18.301 position:50% align:center
but it does jive with the
concept of the labyrinth.

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:21.513 position:50% align:center
Well, ladies, shall we
kick it up a notch?

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.936 position:50% align:center
It's been a while
since I've launched this.

00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:30.271 position:50% align:center
I hope you enjoy,
my serpent friends!

00:20:33.942 --> 00:20:36.778 position:50% align:center
I've just pulled into the lead
with only one attack!

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:39.114 position:50% align:center
Master, if I get the most kills
when all is said and done,

00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:42.075 position:50% align:center
I think I'll deserve
a very special reward!

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:44.411 position:50% align:center
I like the sound of
a reward, but I'm the one

00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:46.746 position:50% align:center
who's gonna get it,
not you, Tio!

00:20:55.964 --> 00:20:58.299 position:50% align:center
Do they have to talk
about that right now?

00:20:58.383 --> 00:20:59.592 position:50% align:center
Reward?

00:20:59.676 --> 00:21:03.179 position:50% align:center
My reward will be a romantic
date, just us two.

00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:04.305 position:50% align:center
Light Wyrm!

00:21:09.394 --> 00:21:11.896 position:50% align:center
Yue is really gunning
for my reward!

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.523 position:50% align:center
Yue is glitching out!

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:15.400 position:50% align:center
Her power is in overdrive!

00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:26.202 position:50% align:center
There aren't any new
snakes appearing--

00:21:26.286 --> 00:21:28.204 position:50% align:center
seems like these five
are the last of them.

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:32.834 position:50% align:center
And I want two of
them all to myself!

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:36.212 position:50% align:center
Grand Gruen Volcano,
conquest complete!

00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:43.053 position:50% align:center
It's been fun, but it's done.

00:22:02.572 --> 00:22:04.657 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
Hajime!

00:23:41.963 --> 00:23:44.132 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Next episode, "Black and White."
