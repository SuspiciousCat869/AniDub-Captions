In my defense, her intervention
was just one part

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.702 position:50% align:center
of my greater plan.

in our path.

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:05.258 position:50% align:center
Now all we need to do is to
stay under Yaegashi's radar,

00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:07.344 position:50% align:center
which shouldn't be too hard.

That's right.

The king and the chancellor
are basically our puppets now,

00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:15.518 position:50% align:center
and the church was never
an obstacle to begin with.

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:17.395 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:20.940 position:50% align:center
[ERI] And now that the commander
is out of the picture as well,

00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:23.526 position:50% align:center
things are working
solidly in our favor.

So, I think we should
expedite the process.

we're gathering speed

Yeah, by bandits, I think.

From what I can tell,
there are about 40 of them

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:19.958 position:50% align:center

a barrier up, as well.

[TIO]
I see.

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:32.679 position:50% align:center
The bandits need to break
that down to get through.

They can't do
anything right now,

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.433 position:50% align:center

magic through the barrier.

[SHEA] Okay, but why aren't
the bandits retreating?

[HAJIME] There aren't many

such a huge barrier

Hey, hold on, why am
I being verbally attacked

00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:38.114 position:50% align:center
right now?

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:42.369 position:50% align:center
So what's the princess doing
getting attacked by bandits

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:43.912 position:50% align:center
way out in the boonies?

00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:50.377 position:50% align:center
[KAORI]
Lily?

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:55.423 position:50% align:center
It's Aiko. She's been kidnapped.

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:12.482 position:50% align:center
[LILIANA] I've felt that there
was something very wrong

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:16.486 position:50% align:center
with the inhabitants of
the castle for a while now.

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center
Father's support of the
Holy Church was growing

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:21.491 position:50% align:center
more radical each day,
and his worship of Lord Ehit

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:23.034 position:50% align:center
was nothing short of feverish.

00:12:23.118 --> 00:12:25.870 position:50% align:center
The change in him
was quite unsettling.

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:27.872 position:50% align:center
At first, I hoped he
might simply be trying

00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:29.582 position:50% align:center
to deepen his connection
with the Church

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:32.377 position:50% align:center
by clearly expressing
his faith, but in truth,

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.754 position:50% align:center
that explanation
rang hollow to me.

00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:37.590 position:50% align:center
It was around then that
the knights and soldiers

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center
began to change, as well.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.678 position:50% align:center
They grew lethargic as if
suffering from an illness

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
of some kind.

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:47.976 position:50% align:center
My suspicions grew when
Nagumo was branded a heretic.

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:50.603 position:50% align:center
Your efforts at the town of Ur
and the Great Orcus Labyrinth

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:52.397 position:50% align:center
were ignored,
and no one would listen

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.067 position:50% align:center
to any of the objections
Ms. Aiko tried to raise.

00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:59.112 position:50% align:center
Of course, I made my own
objections to my father,

00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:02.323 position:50% align:center
but he was determined to declare
Nagumo an enemy of God,

00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:05.076 position:50% align:center
and there was nothing I could
say or do to change his mind.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.369 position:50% align:center
Things got worse.

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:08.163 position:50% align:center
Before long, Father
began to look at me

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:11.708 position:50% align:center
as if I were an enemy, too,
rather than his daughter.

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:13.501 position:50% align:center
I didn't know what else to do,

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:17.672 position:50% align:center
so I sought out Ms. Aiko for
her advice on the situation.

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:20.508 position:50% align:center
But before I could,
she was kidnapped by this nun

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:23.011 position:50% align:center
from the Divine Mountain.

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:26.014 position:50% align:center
I thought the nun might be
behind all of this somehow

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:28.850 position:50% align:center
or connected to
the person who is.

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:31.519 position:50% align:center
It was just so frightening.

00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:33.897 position:50% align:center
I knew that I had
to tell someone.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.316 position:50% align:center
But I assumed that everyone
in and around the castle

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:38.234 position:50% align:center
would be under
close surveillance,

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:39.903 position:50% align:center
so I would have
to look elsewhere.

00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:43.448 position:50% align:center
When I thought of who
might be able to help,

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:46.659 position:50% align:center
Kaori, you and Nagumo were
the first who came to mind.

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
Shizuku told me that
you had travelled west.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.290 position:50% align:center
Anyway, that brings us to now.

00:13:52.374 --> 00:13:55.043 position:50% align:center
I thought I would start by
asking Duke Zengen for help,

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:57.629 position:50% align:center
so I sought out a caravan
to ride with, and well,

00:13:57.712 --> 00:14:00.715 position:50% align:center
you saw how that
turned out, I suppose.

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:03.218 position:50% align:center
I must say, I didn't imagine
I would run into you

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:05.220 position:50% align:center
like this.

00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:07.222 position:50% align:center
Not long ago, I'd have
considered our meeting

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:09.974 position:50% align:center
in such a way a
blessing from god.

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:12.310 position:50% align:center
But my faith is shaken.

00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:15.397 position:50% align:center
I fear the Church's power.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.856 position:50% align:center
Something is wrong.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.608 position:50% align:center
If only I knew the reason.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.277 position:50% align:center
Oh, Lily.

00:14:30.412 --> 00:14:32.330 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Well, I guess the
first thing I need to do

00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:34.416 position:50% align:center
is go save my teacher.

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:36.292 position:50% align:center
You would do that?

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:37.627 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Don't get too excited.

00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:39.504 position:50% align:center
I'm not looking to
save the kingdom.

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:41.756 position:50% align:center
But for her sake,
yeah, I'll do it.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.717 position:50% align:center
[LILIANA]
For her? But...

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.677 position:50% align:center
I can't just leave her in this
mess if I'm the reason

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.262 position:50% align:center
she got kidnapped.

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:50.515 position:50% align:center
She deserves better
than that from me.

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:53.601 position:50% align:center
Of course, if somebody
were to get in my way,

00:14:53.685 --> 00:14:56.271 position:50% align:center
like maybe the person who's
responsible for all of this,

00:14:56.354 --> 00:15:00.316 position:50% align:center
I'd have no choice but
to tear whoever it is apart.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.901 position:50% align:center
Well, then, I guess
I'll just have to hope

00:15:01.985 --> 00:15:03.778 position:50% align:center
they decide to get in your way.

00:15:03.862 --> 00:15:05.697 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy I found
you when I did.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.115 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Nagumo.

00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:09.909 position:50% align:center
As it happens,
the Divine Mountain is also

00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:11.536 position:50% align:center
one of the Great Labyrinths.

00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:16.416 position:50% align:center
I wonder what kind of Age of
God's magic I can get there.

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:18.043 position:50% align:center
Hajime, you're awesome.

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.419 position:50% align:center
Yeah, no kidding!

00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:22.464 position:50% align:center
I love when he gets that
devious look on his face.

00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:25.050 position:50% align:center
It makes my heart
do silly things!

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:27.594 position:50% align:center
[TIO] Hmm.
You should be careful, Master.

00:15:27.677 --> 00:15:30.013 position:50% align:center
That vicious tone
in your voice--

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:32.015 position:50% align:center
It goes straight
to my lady bits!

00:16:16.643 --> 00:16:19.354 position:50% align:center
[AIKO] What are my
students trying to do?

00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:22.440 position:50% align:center
They're up to something,
but what could it be?

00:16:22.524 --> 00:16:24.984 position:50% align:center
Eliminating the Irregular.

00:16:25.068 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
What does that mean,
the Irregular?

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:40.125 position:50% align:center
Nagumo, please.

00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:42.002 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Yeah. Just gimme a minute.

00:16:42.085 --> 00:16:43.086 position:50% align:center
[AIKO gasps]

00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:46.131 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Over by the window.

00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:50.385 position:50% align:center
[AIKO]
Huh? Nagumo, is that you?

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:52.470 position:50% align:center
But this is the top floor
of the Divine Mountain!

00:16:52.554 --> 00:16:53.680 position:50% align:center
How?

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:56.016 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Uh, whoa,
hey, easy there, Teach.

00:16:56.099 --> 00:16:57.475 position:50% align:center
You're gonna burst
a blood vessel.

00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:58.727 position:50% align:center
Take a deep breath.

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:00.729 position:50% align:center
I gotta finish checking
for traps real quick.

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.787 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
What's with the gaspy fish-face?

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:20.623 position:50% align:center
I mean, you noticed me
approaching, didn't you?

00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:23.376 position:50% align:center
Which is weird since I thought
I'd masked myself completely.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.962 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Noticed? What?

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:27.505 position:50% align:center
Well, you must've.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:29.299 position:50% align:center
I heard you call out
my name before.

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:30.508 position:50% align:center
Why else would
you have done that?

00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:33.720 position:50% align:center
Uh... Yeah, so anyway,
why are you here?

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:35.472 position:50% align:center
To get you. Why else?

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:36.514 position:50% align:center
[AIKO]
What?!

00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:37.891 position:50% align:center
You came here for me?

00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:40.769 position:50% align:center
You came for me?
You came here--

00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:42.187 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
The hell?

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.689 position:50% align:center
They haven't scrambled her brain
or something, have they?

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:51.654 position:50% align:center
Oh, I, uh... I don't think
this is a good idea.

00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:53.698 position:50% align:center
It's so sudden, and I'm
your teacher, after all.

00:17:55.867 --> 00:17:58.536 position:50% align:center
Um... I'm just trying
to take this off.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:02.332 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Guessing you'd rather
have access to your magic.

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:04.709 position:50% align:center
Or did you want to hang
onto it for some reason?

00:18:04.793 --> 00:18:06.252 position:50% align:center
Right. Uh...

00:18:06.336 --> 00:18:08.296 position:50% align:center
Of course that's
what you were doing.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.590 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah. What did
you think I was up to?

00:18:10.674 --> 00:18:14.094 position:50% align:center
[AIKO laughs]

00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:17.222 position:50% align:center
Oh, nothing.
Nope, absolutely nothing.

00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:26.773 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you came here,
but I don't understand

00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:29.317 position:50% align:center
how you knew where
I was being held.

00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:31.319 position:50% align:center
No one else was around
when I was taken.

00:18:31.403 --> 00:18:33.154 position:50% align:center
The princess tracked me down.

00:18:33.238 --> 00:18:34.864 position:50% align:center
Really? But why?

00:18:34.948 --> 00:18:36.116 position:50% align:center
How did she know?

00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:37.158 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
She was there.

00:18:37.242 --> 00:18:39.202 position:50% align:center
She saw you getting kidnapped.

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:40.662 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:43.707 position:50% align:center
Except, she figured that the
castle was being watched,

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:47.168 position:50% align:center
so she couldn't risk telling
Amanogawa and the others.

00:18:47.252 --> 00:18:50.338 position:50% align:center
Which meant leaving
the capital to find help

00:18:50.422 --> 00:18:52.132 position:50% align:center
and doing it all on her own.

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:57.053 position:50% align:center
Truly? She did that?

00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:58.847 position:50% align:center
And when she found you,
you were willing to come

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:00.849 position:50% align:center
all this way to rescue me?

00:19:00.932 --> 00:19:02.434 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:19:02.517 --> 00:19:05.687 position:50% align:center
Well, I am at least partially
responsible for this situation.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.273 position:50% align:center
I'm sure I'm the last
person you wanted to see.

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:10.316 position:50% align:center
Still, I hope you don't
mind putting up with me

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.943 position:50% align:center
for a little while at least.

00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:29.711 position:50% align:center
You're definitely not the last
person I wanted to see.

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:32.547 position:50% align:center
It's true, what happened
with Shimizu was awful,

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.216 position:50% align:center
and I haven't gotten
over it completely.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.468 position:50% align:center
Honestly,

00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:39.679 position:50% align:center
I don't know if I'll
ever truly be over it.

00:19:39.763 --> 00:19:42.432 position:50% align:center
Even so, I think I
understand what you felt

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:43.892 position:50% align:center
when you pulled that trigger.

00:19:43.975 --> 00:19:46.144 position:50% align:center
Why you thought
you had to do it.

00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:48.396 position:50% align:center
You do?

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.149 position:50% align:center
I wasn't able to say
this properly back then,

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:53.860 position:50% align:center
so let me say it now.

00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:55.945 position:50% align:center
Thank you for saving me, Nagumo.

00:19:57.489 --> 00:20:00.325 position:50% align:center
You killed one of your
classmates because of me.

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:01.576 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:10.877 position:50% align:center
Stop it.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.712 position:50% align:center
You should know by now
I make my own decisions.

00:20:12.796 --> 00:20:15.256 position:50% align:center
So I'll take the gratitude
and leave the apology.

00:20:17.592 --> 00:20:19.427 position:50% align:center
Anyway, let's get going.

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:22.347 position:50% align:center
[AIKO]
Nagumo, please be careful.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.057 position:50% align:center
It's likely that labeling
you a heretic

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.434 position:50% align:center
was just the Church's
opening gambit.

00:20:26.518 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center
And the person who kidnapped
me might be involved

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:29.354 position:50% align:center
with their plans somehow.

00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:31.272 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Yeah, I know.

00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:33.316 position:50% align:center
Whatever's going on,
once I get you to safety,

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.735 position:50% align:center
I'll have my own
business to see to,

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:37.612 position:50% align:center
and one way or another,
that's likely gonna mean

00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:39.989 position:50% align:center
taking on the Church.

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:43.952 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, so you've been
ready for this all along.

00:20:44.035 --> 00:20:45.120 position:50% align:center
I have.

00:20:45.203 --> 00:20:46.496 position:50% align:center
[crash]

00:20:52.627 --> 00:20:54.629 position:50% align:center
Well, this is
interesting timing.

00:20:54.713 --> 00:20:57.173 position:50% align:center
It might actually work in our
favor, so I won't complain.

00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:59.634 position:50% align:center
What's going on?
Did something happen?

00:20:59.718 --> 00:21:01.344 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
The Demons are attacking.

00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:03.054 position:50% align:center
What we just heard was the
barrier surrounding

00:21:03.138 --> 00:21:04.806 position:50% align:center
the capital being shattered.

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:06.725 position:50% align:center
[AIKO]
The Demons are attacking?!

00:21:06.808 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
That's right.

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:10.562 position:50% align:center
The Heiligh Kingdom is
being invaded as we speak.

00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:11.980 position:50% align:center
No. It can't be.

00:21:12.063 --> 00:21:13.815 position:50% align:center
Taken completely by surprise.

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:15.525 position:50% align:center
So what now then?

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:16.776 position:50% align:center
You go.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.112 position:50% align:center
Regroup with Amanogawa
and the others first.

00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:20.530 position:50% align:center
We can talk more later.

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:22.157 position:50% align:center
Oh, okay.

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:41.468 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Looks like... Disintegration?

00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:42.927 position:50% align:center
[NOINT]
Precisely.

00:21:53.146 --> 00:21:56.858 position:50% align:center
Irregular, my name is Noint.

00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:59.986 position:50% align:center
And, as god's apostle,
it is my task to remove

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.405 position:50% align:center
unnecessary pieces
from the board.

00:23:42.005 --> 00:23:44.758 position:50% align:center
