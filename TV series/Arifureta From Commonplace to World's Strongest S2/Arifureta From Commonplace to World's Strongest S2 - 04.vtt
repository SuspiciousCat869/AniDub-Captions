Stay sharp!

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:36.786 position:50% align:center
That's not a dragon!

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.079 position:50% align:center
It's just a woman!

[KAORI]
Tio! Are you all right?

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:43.585 position:50% align:center
Tio!

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:47.881 position:50% align:center
Hi, Kaori.

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.384 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm perfectly fine.

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:53.511 position:50% align:center
Just a bit tired, is all.

00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:59.642 position:50% align:center
Where are Hajime and the others?

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:02.520 position:50% align:center
Why are you here alone?

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:04.564 position:50% align:center
[TIO]
It's okay, Kaori.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:06.358 position:50% align:center
But the volcano erupted!

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:46.374 position:50% align:center
So, you're saying Hajime's fine?

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:50.420 position:50% align:center
Yes, they should be catching
up with us quite soon.

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:54.257 position:50% align:center
Master seemed optimistic that
they'd make it out unscathed.

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:56.217 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he had some
plan that he didn't share

00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:57.344 position:50% align:center
with me.

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:02.515 position:50% align:center
Kaori, He wanted me to pass
a message along to you.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.309 position:50% align:center
[KAORI]
To me, specifically?

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:05.518 position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:08.897 position:50% align:center
Well, you and Myu both,
to be exact.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.440 position:50% align:center
"I'll catch ya later."

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.027 position:50% align:center
Kaori?

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:16.571 position:50% align:center
Uh, good.

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:18.406 position:50% align:center
That means he's
going to be all right.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.910 position:50% align:center
Even if the situation seems
utterly hopeless to others,

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:23.661 position:50% align:center
Master will survive
with ease and act like

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:26.122 position:50% align:center
the whole feat was nothing.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.541 position:50% align:center
Of that we can
be certain, can't we?

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:33.505 position:50% align:center
Aren't we going to
go pick up Papa?

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.840 position:50% align:center
Let's have faith in Papa
Hajime and keep doing

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:38.551 position:50% align:center
everything we can on
our end to help out here.

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:42.055 position:50% align:center
We'll go pick him up once
things are taken care of.

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:44.641 position:50% align:center
I just realized, there's no
way we can take Myu

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.810 position:50% align:center
with us to the Grand
Gruen Volcano.

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.395 position:50% align:center
Oh, you're right.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:52.023 position:50% align:center
Then let's head to Erisen first
and reunite Myu with her mother.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:55.276 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a perfect plan.

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:18.383 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
How many days has it been now?

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.721 position:50% align:center
Hajime, how are you feeling?

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:24.556 position:50% align:center
I'm doin' all right.

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.809 position:50% align:center
It's just gonna take me a
little longer to fully recover.

00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:30.020 position:50% align:center
How do you feel?

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.229 position:50% align:center
I'm fine.

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:34.315 position:50% align:center
Shea let me suck
a bit of her blood.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
And why're you on top of me?

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:39.404 position:50% align:center
Because you're you and I'm me?

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:45.368 position:50% align:center
The poison from the Burning
Light is almost gone.

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:46.327 position:50% align:center
That's good. =

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:48.580 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I told you, I'm fine.

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:51.332 position:50% align:center
Yes, but I still can't
help worrying.

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.335 position:50% align:center
I'm glad we have
a chance to rest up,

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:55.628 position:50% align:center
though the location isn't ideal.

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:59.632 position:50% align:center
I agree, that was a
crazy chain of events.

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:02.052 position:50% align:center
I don't know if we're
lucky or really unlucky.

00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:17.734 position:50% align:center
Almost there!

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:19.194 position:50% align:center
Just a little farther!

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:27.494 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
Huh?

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:41.925 position:50% align:center
Ah, hell.

00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Seems like we're safe for now.

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.057 position:50% align:center
Hajime, look there.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:52.852 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
A magic circle.

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:04.614 position:50% align:center
Does this magic control space?

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:07.659 position:50% align:center
That must be how he did it.

00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:10.787 position:50% align:center
[SHEA] You mean how he appeared
behind us all of a sudden?

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:21.715 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] "This is my prayer:
that someday in the future,

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:25.844 position:50% align:center
humankind will be free.
Naiz Gruen."

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:29.597 position:50% align:center
It's short and sweet.

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:32.017 position:50% align:center
I guess he put his
affairs in order.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
He really did.

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.936 position:50% align:center
He didn't leave anything
behind except for

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.479 position:50% align:center
the magic circle.

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:52.704 position:50% align:center
All right, we got the proof
of conquest and the magic.

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:55.790 position:50% align:center
Now, any idea how
to get out of here?

00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:58.335 position:50% align:center
Well, Spatial Magic
is hard to master,

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:00.378 position:50% align:center
so we can't use that
to get out yet.

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:02.922 position:50% align:center
You do have an escape plan,
though, don't you?

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:05.175 position:50% align:center
The way out is probably
totally blocked off by lava

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:07.552 position:50% align:center
at this point.

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:09.846 position:50% align:center
We're just gonna have to
swim through it, I guess.

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:16.061 position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:17.812 position:50% align:center
Don't you girls have
faith in your boy?

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:29.657 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Actually, I built a
ship that can travel underwater.

00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:31.701 position:50% align:center
The Sunken Ruins of
Melusine are up next,

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.745 position:50% align:center
and I figured we'd
need one for that.

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:35.914 position:50% align:center
That's our best bet now.

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:38.500 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure it'll be able
to withstand the lava.

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:40.585 position:50% align:center
But it seems like we're
all out of options.

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:02.399 position:50% align:center
Looks like the old girl
will hold up just fine.

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:11.157 position:50% align:center
[SHEA gasps]
Great, what's happening now?

00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:13.576 position:50% align:center
Dammit. Sorry, lost control.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.829 position:50% align:center
If this were an eruption, it
would've tossed us out the top.

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:17.330 position:50% align:center
Something else is going on.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:23.003 position:50% align:center
We're going straight down?

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:25.714 position:50% align:center
No, something's pushing
us down at an angle!

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:26.798 position:50% align:center
That's not good!

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.134 position:50% align:center
We wanna go up,
not deeper underground!

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:32.387 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Well, ladies, I don't
think it's gonna be a quick trip

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.847 position:50% align:center
outta here.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.181 position:50% align:center
Seems like we'll have
to ride this train

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:36.474 position:50% align:center
to the end of the line.

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:39.978 position:50% align:center
I'll ride any train you're on.

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:42.856 position:50% align:center
As long as I'm beside you,
I have no regrets.

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:46.109 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I thought this was a ship,
not a train, but same here.

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:48.361 position:50% align:center
Whatever train or ship
you guys are riding.

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:50.572 position:50% align:center
I wanna be on it,
too, no matter what!

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:06.796 position:50% align:center
[ALL yelling]

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:24.230 position:50% align:center
Crap, we're out of ammo!

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:25.440 position:50% align:center
I got this.

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:39.329 position:50% align:center
Yue, you good?
Take my blood!

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.664 position:50% align:center
Can't quit yet. I'm fine.

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:42.540 position:50% align:center
Yue.

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:43.708 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
Um, hello?

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:46.961 position:50% align:center
I'm on this "train ship,"
too, remember?

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:48.588 position:50% align:center
If you need blood,
then take mine.

00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:49.923 position:50% align:center
I mean it!

00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:10.276 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME sighs]
How's Shea?

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.529 position:50% align:center
Well, she gave me
a lot of her blood.

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:15.073 position:50% align:center
She's all right,
but she'll be out for a while.

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:16.199 position:50% align:center
Makes sense.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.286 position:50% align:center
[SHEA growls]

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:23.790 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, you're awake.
How ya doin'?

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:25.000 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
Oh, I see how it is.

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:26.626 position:50% align:center
You guys are just gonna
snuggle up out here

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.795 position:50% align:center
while I waste away
in my sick bed.

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:30.714 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about me,
I'm just fine.

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:32.716 position:50% align:center
And don't come
check on me either!

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:35.051 position:50% align:center
Oh, for crying out loud.

00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:37.220 position:50% align:center
[SHEA] No land as far
as the eye can see.

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:38.722 position:50% align:center
Where do you think we are?

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:40.181 position:50% align:center
Good question.

00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:42.475 position:50% align:center
I'd like to run some
tests and find out,

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:45.145 position:50% align:center
but Tio still has the
Treasure Trove with her.

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:46.896 position:50% align:center
So I can't.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.815 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
We go where the wind takes us.

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.401 position:50% align:center
Sounds like something someone
says when they're lost.

00:10:58.324 --> 00:10:59.784 position:50% align:center
Who are you, and what
are you doing here?

00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:01.119 position:50% align:center
Answer us now!

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:03.413 position:50% align:center
What is this strange contraption
you ride? Tell us!

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:08.251 position:50% align:center
If you're trying to get
sympathy, it won't work!

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:10.628 position:50% align:center
Is that the trick you used
to kidnap the girl, too?

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:14.841 position:50% align:center
Have you come here to steal more
of our precious merchildren?

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:17.552 position:50% align:center
You're not talking
about Myu, are you?

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.054 position:50% align:center
There's no need to get angry.

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:20.388 position:50% align:center
Silence, you!

00:11:20.472 --> 00:11:22.515 position:50% align:center
No one gave you permission
to speak, rabbitwench!

00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:25.643 position:50% align:center
[MERFOLK A yells]

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.148 position:50% align:center
Excellent shot.

00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
I'm picking something up!

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.444 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:35.779 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Papa!

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:36.863 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
The hell?

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:39.199 position:50% align:center
You're kidding me.

00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:40.575 position:50% align:center
I'm here!

00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:44.204 position:50% align:center
M-Myu?!

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.416 position:50% align:center
[MYU laughs]

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:01.721 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Papa!

00:12:04.099 --> 00:12:05.141 position:50% align:center
Hello.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:15.694 position:50% align:center
[MYU crying]

00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:18.988 position:50% align:center
Yes, Papa. I'm sorry.

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:21.157 position:50% align:center
Promise you won't
do that again, 'kay?

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:22.617 position:50% align:center
It was dangerous.

00:12:22.701 --> 00:12:24.160 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Promise.

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:26.246 position:50% align:center
Good. I forgive you.

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:27.414 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Papa!

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:31.084 position:50% align:center
I'm just so glad.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:33.795 position:50% align:center
I'm so relieved to see
you again in one piece!

00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:36.256 position:50% align:center
I told you that
I'd catch ya later.

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:38.258 position:50% align:center
But yes, as you
can see, I'm fine.

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center
So come on.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.011 position:50% align:center
Stop crying.

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:42.512 position:50% align:center
If Shizuku found out
I made you cry,

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.139 position:50% align:center
she'd have my head on a stake.

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:47.934 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Okay.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.897 position:50% align:center
I need a hug. Just one.

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:57.193 position:50% align:center
What the--

00:12:58.737 --> 00:12:59.529 position:50% align:center
Tio!

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.531 position:50% align:center
I didn't doubt you one bit!

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:04.409 position:50% align:center
I always believed in you,
but why did you make me

00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:07.037 position:50% align:center
wait so long?

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.539 position:50% align:center
Please give me some
of your time, my master!

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:11.124 position:50% align:center
Take me on a date!

00:13:11.207 --> 00:13:15.754 position:50% align:center
Please! I beg you, Master!
Give me my reward!

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.237 position:50% align:center
[PASSERBY A]
Hey, is that the girl who was--?

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:42.489 position:50% align:center
[PASSERBY B]
Yeah, it is.

00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:44.866 position:50% align:center
Remia's daughter,
the one who got kidnapped.

00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:51.331 position:50% align:center
I verify that you have
completed the mission

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:53.708 position:50% align:center
assigned by the guild master.

00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:56.795 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Mr. Nagumo,
gold-rank adventurer.

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:58.713 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you have tons
of questions for me,

00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:01.633 position:50% align:center
but for now, can we
take this young lady

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:04.094 position:50% align:center
to her mother and talk later?

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:05.345 position:50% align:center
[ERISEN SOLDIER]
Of course.

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:07.138 position:50% align:center
However, I will need answers.

00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:08.973 position:50% align:center
What with the sighting
of the dragon out at sea,

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:10.517 position:50% align:center
and that ship-like vehicle.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.436 position:50% align:center
As a soldier of the kingdom,
I am required to investigate.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.398 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'll be staying here
in Erisen for a little while.

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:19.317 position:50% align:center
I bet you and I can find some
time to have a conversation.

00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:20.860 position:50% align:center
[ERISEN SOLDIER] Yes, there will
be plenty of opportunities

00:14:20.944 --> 00:14:22.153 position:50% align:center
to talk things over.

00:14:22.237 --> 00:14:24.447 position:50% align:center
Get settled in,
and I'll be in contact.

00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:26.199 position:50% align:center
All right, show's over!

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:28.535 position:50% align:center
If anyone feels like they
still wanna loiter,

00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:30.412 position:50% align:center
they'll get a free stay
in jail for impeding

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:31.913 position:50% align:center
military business!

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:35.583 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Papa, hurry up.

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:37.168 position:50% align:center
Let's go to my house!

00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:38.962 position:50% align:center
I wanna see my Mama!

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:41.548 position:50% align:center
Okay, let's get
over there, stat.

00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:48.763 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
C'mon! This way, Papa!

00:14:48.847 --> 00:14:50.140 position:50% align:center
Okay, okay.

00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:51.391 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Hurry up!

00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:56.062 position:50% align:center
[HELPER A]
Remia, calm down!

00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:57.522 position:50% align:center
You can't go anywhere
with that leg!

00:14:57.605 --> 00:14:59.107 position:50% align:center
[HELPER B]
Seriously, just relax!

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.276 position:50% align:center
We'll bring Myu back,
we promise!

00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:04.446 position:50% align:center
"Relax?" Myu got kidnapped,
now she's back.

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.448 position:50% align:center
I can't wait! I have to see her!

00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:08.116 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Mama!

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:09.701 position:50% align:center
Myu? Myu?

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:11.161 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Mama!

00:15:13.163 --> 00:15:14.497 position:50% align:center
[REMIA]
Forgive me.

00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:18.251 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry I couldn't
protect you, Myu.

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:20.587 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
It's okay, Mama. I'm safe.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.798 position:50% align:center
Everything is fine.
I came home to you.

00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:27.886 position:50% align:center
[REMIA]
Myu.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.097 position:50% align:center
[ONLOOKER]
Aww! I'm so glad!

00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:32.891 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Mama! Your leg!

00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:35.268 position:50% align:center
What happened?
Are you okay?

00:15:35.352 --> 00:15:36.686 position:50% align:center
Does it hurt?

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.022 position:50% align:center
Papa! Please help Mama!

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:40.899 position:50% align:center
Mama's leg hurts!

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.651 position:50% align:center
Papa? Wait, Myu,
did you just say--

00:15:43.735 --> 00:15:45.528 position:50% align:center
Papa! Please, hurry!

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:47.447 position:50% align:center
She did. I heard it.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.491 position:50% align:center
She called that man "Papa."

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:52.202 position:50% align:center
[MERMAN A]
Huh? Papa? I think she means me!

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:54.829 position:50% align:center
Yeah, in your dreams!
It has to be me!

00:15:54.913 --> 00:15:56.706 position:50% align:center
It's me, duh!
You're both delusional!

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.833 position:50% align:center
Papa, Mama's hurt.

00:15:58.917 --> 00:16:00.794 position:50% align:center
Don't worry yourself, 'kay?

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:02.962 position:50% align:center
She'll be fine.

00:16:03.046 --> 00:16:05.840 position:50% align:center
We'll help her.
I promise you that.

00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:07.300 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay.

00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:10.720 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Hello, there.

00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:12.138 position:50% align:center
Apologies in advance.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.685 position:50% align:center
What're you--?

00:16:21.773 --> 00:16:23.400 position:50% align:center
[MERMAN C]
Remia's getting re-married?

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:24.859 position:50% align:center
This can't be happening!

00:16:24.943 --> 00:16:26.319 position:50% align:center
[MERWOMAN B] Remia is finally
seeing someone after all

00:16:26.403 --> 00:16:29.280 position:50% align:center
this time? I'm so glad!

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:31.074 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
I bet I know what's up.

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:33.243 position:50% align:center
The guys who kidnapped
Myu must be responsible

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:34.786 position:50% align:center
for this, too.

00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:37.497 position:50% align:center
Kaori, verdict?

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.873 position:50% align:center
She'll be fine.

00:16:38.957 --> 00:16:41.251 position:50% align:center
I should have no
trouble healing this.

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:43.253 position:50% align:center
I'd like to spend a few
days on it, though.

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:45.338 position:50% align:center
In order to avoid any
unpleasant side effects,

00:16:45.422 --> 00:16:47.924 position:50% align:center
I think it'd be best
to take our time.

00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:50.176 position:50% align:center
It might be a bit
uncomfortable until then,

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.012 position:50% align:center
but it'll heal up good as new.

00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:53.722 position:50% align:center
Trust me, you'll be all right.

00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:56.224 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank you!
What a relief!

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:58.268 position:50% align:center
I had come to believe this
wound was impossible

00:16:58.351 --> 00:16:59.519 position:50% align:center
to heal!

00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:01.521 position:50% align:center
How can I ever repay you?

00:17:03.773 --> 00:17:06.401 position:50% align:center
So, um, I'm very curious.

00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:08.278 position:50% align:center
How did you all find Myu?

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:12.115 position:50% align:center
And, well, also,
I just have to know.

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:13.950 position:50% align:center
Why does Myu call you Papa?

00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:18.038 position:50% align:center
Are you ready for an epic story?

00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:22.917 position:50% align:center
[REMIA] Thanks to you,
I have my daughter back,

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:25.462 position:50% align:center
and my leg will be healed.

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:28.673 position:50% align:center
I will repay this debt, even it
takes the rest of my life.

00:17:28.757 --> 00:17:30.133 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about it.

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:33.053 position:50% align:center
You're her mother--
you owe us nothing.

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:34.804 position:50% align:center
I agree!

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:38.475 position:50% align:center
Yes, we only did what was right.

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:40.560 position:50% align:center
I heard you all are planning
to remain in Erisen

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:42.354 position:50% align:center
for a little while.

00:17:42.437 --> 00:17:44.064 position:50% align:center
I'd be honored if you
would all be my guests

00:17:44.147 --> 00:17:45.190 position:50% align:center
while you're here.

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:46.983 position:50% align:center
I know Myu would love that, too.

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:48.151 position:50% align:center
No, thanks.

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:50.195 position:50% align:center
That's kind, but I
think we'll pass.

00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:53.365 position:50% align:center
There's a nice inn by the pier,
and we'll be staying there.

00:17:53.448 --> 00:17:55.742 position:50% align:center
The ship needs maintenance,
so it's convenient.

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:56.993 position:50% align:center
[REMIA]
Oh, I see.

00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:58.870 position:50% align:center
Are you perhaps trying
to distance yourself

00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:00.497 position:50% align:center
from your adopted daughter?

00:18:02.457 --> 00:18:05.335 position:50% align:center
Papa. Are you going away?

00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:09.214 position:50% align:center
I understand that you'll have
to leave here eventually,

00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:11.549 position:50% align:center
but still, while you're here,

00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:13.343 position:50% align:center
it would make me so
happy if you'd treat Myu

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:14.719 position:50% align:center
like your own.

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:19.891 position:50% align:center
But it doesn't have to end
when you leave, either.

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:22.644 position:50% align:center
You can be her papa
forever, if you want.

00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:24.771 position:50% align:center
I owe you more than I
could possibly repay you,

00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:26.147 position:50% align:center
after all.

00:18:26.231 --> 00:18:28.942 position:50% align:center
Um, I wouldn't say things
like that if I were you.

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:31.111 position:50% align:center
Ladies, please don't hurt her!

00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:33.321 position:50% align:center
My goodness!

00:18:33.405 --> 00:18:35.407 position:50% align:center
They really care about you, huh.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.618 position:50% align:center
You see, it's been five years
since I lost my husband,

00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:39.786 position:50% align:center
Myu's father.

00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:41.788 position:50% align:center
Myu, you want a Papa, don't you?

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:42.914 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:44.624 position:50% align:center
Papa is my Papa.

00:18:45.834 --> 00:18:48.920 position:50% align:center
I rest my case. Papa.

00:18:49.004 --> 00:18:51.589 position:50% align:center
[MERMAN D]
Hey, emergency meeting!

00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:53.341 position:50% align:center
[MERMAN E]
This is a disaster!

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:03.727 position:50% align:center
Where is she?

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.770 position:50% align:center
Oh, right, she did say
she was gonna report

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:07.063 position:50% align:center
to the king first.

00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:18.533 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Ms. Aiko! Long time no see!

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.744 position:50% align:center
Goodness! Hi there, Yaegashi!

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:25.415 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
I'm so sad about Shimizu.

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:28.084 position:50% align:center
In any case, I'm still happy
you made it out of there,

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:30.795 position:50% align:center
Ms. Aiko. Really.

00:19:30.879 --> 00:19:32.797 position:50% align:center
I guess we have Nagumo
to thank for that.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.511 position:50% align:center
He went there intending to save
just you and the others,

00:19:38.595 --> 00:19:40.764 position:50% align:center
but he saved a little girl
from slavery, too.

00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:42.182 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:19:42.265 --> 00:19:44.476 position:50% align:center
I wonder if he's
remembering his old self

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:46.728 position:50% align:center
and becoming more
like he used to be.

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:48.271 position:50% align:center
Or maybe he's changed,
but he's still

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:50.357 position:50% align:center
growing up somehow.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.692 position:50% align:center
Either way, he's so impressive!

00:19:52.776 --> 00:19:55.445 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:19:57.447 --> 00:19:59.115 position:50% align:center
Ahem!

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center
Ms. Aiko?

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:02.160 position:50% align:center
Earlier, you told me
you were saved

00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:06.915 position:50% align:center
from a dangerous situation,
but how exactly were you saved?

00:20:06.998 --> 00:20:10.377 position:50% align:center
I mean, you almost died
sounds so dramatic.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.170 position:50% align:center
It piqued my curiosity,
so I have to know

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:13.797 position:50% align:center
how you recovered.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.217 position:50% align:center
Well, you see,
about that whole thing.

00:20:18.802 --> 00:20:22.013 position:50% align:center
Hang on, did something
happen between you two?

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:23.807 position:50% align:center
[AIKO] No! Of course not!
I mean, depends on what

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.392 position:50% align:center
you mean by
"something," but no,

00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:26.726 position:50% align:center
we're just student and teacher!

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:28.603 position:50% align:center
I definitely never
think about kissing him!

00:20:28.687 --> 00:20:30.647 position:50% align:center
Ms. Aiko?
Why are you freaking out?

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.190 position:50% align:center
Makes you seem suspicious.

00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:37.529 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] Nagumo! What did
you do to this woman?

00:20:39.364 --> 00:20:41.449 position:50% align:center
Anyway, what happened
when you made the report

00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:44.869 position:50% align:center
to the king? What did he say?

00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:46.121 position:50% align:center
It's awful.

00:20:46.204 --> 00:20:49.582 position:50% align:center
Nagumo's officially
been branded a heretic.

00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:51.167 position:50% align:center
That's absurd!

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:53.753 position:50% align:center
The punishment doesn't
fit the crime in the least!

00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:55.714 position:50% align:center
Yes, I completely agree.

00:20:55.797 --> 00:20:58.091 position:50% align:center
Even though he's a formidable
force and refuses to obey

00:20:58.174 --> 00:21:01.011 position:50% align:center
the church, he did save
the town of Ur after all,

00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:03.722 position:50% align:center
and that should
count for something!

00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:06.516 position:50% align:center
But still, no matter how
strenuously I objected,

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:08.893 position:50% align:center
they didn't listen.

00:21:08.977 --> 00:21:10.895 position:50% align:center
I thought they had to
consider my objections,

00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:12.814 position:50% align:center
but they didn't seem to care.

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:15.817 position:50% align:center
If they're ignoring you and
branding Nagumo a heretic,

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.277 position:50% align:center
doesn't that mean they're
denying the Goddess

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.780 position:50% align:center
of Fertility in doing so?

00:21:20.864 --> 00:21:23.408 position:50% align:center
There must be
something else going on.

00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:25.702 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,
the king and the other officials

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:27.328 position:50% align:center
seemed somehow different.

00:21:27.412 --> 00:21:28.621 position:50% align:center
In fact,

00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:30.290 position:50% align:center
I'd call them suspicious!

00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:32.667 position:50% align:center
That makes me very uneasy.

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:35.170 position:50% align:center
What are they thinking,
challenging Nagumo?

00:21:35.253 --> 00:21:37.505 position:50% align:center
He's stronger than
all of them together.

00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:40.383 position:50% align:center
They must have someone
in their pocket.

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:42.594 position:50% align:center
Yaegashi.

00:21:42.677 --> 00:21:44.137 position:50% align:center
There's something that
Nagumo revealed to me

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.805 position:50% align:center
that I haven't mentioned yet.

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:48.850 position:50% align:center
Something he revealed?

00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:50.185 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:52.187 position:50% align:center
About the god the
church worships,

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.689 position:50% align:center
and what Nagumo's goal is.

00:21:54.773 --> 00:21:57.025 position:50% align:center
I don't have any proof
of what he said.

00:21:57.108 --> 00:21:59.736 position:50% align:center
But I believe it,
and it changes everything.

00:22:03.448 --> 00:22:05.075 position:50% align:center
I need to tell you about it,

00:22:05.158 --> 00:22:06.868 position:50% align:center
and I think I had
better do that soon,

00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:08.370 position:50% align:center
before it's too late.

00:23:41.546 --> 00:23:44.674 position:50% align:center
