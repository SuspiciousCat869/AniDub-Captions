[TIO roars]

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:49.150 position:50% align:center
[TIO]
Fear not, Aiko.

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:53.822 position:50% align:center
I understand that you're worried
about Master, but we must hurry.

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:56.074 position:50% align:center
I have to drop you off
as soon as possible,

00:01:56.157 --> 00:01:59.577 position:50% align:center
and then get back
to fight those scum.

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:02.414 position:50% align:center
I cannot allow them
to stand in Master's way.

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:05.583 position:50% align:center
[AIKO] If you'd only let me,
I know I can help!

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:08.044 position:50% align:center
I may not look it, but my
magic power is actually

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:10.463 position:50% align:center
on par with the hero, Amanogawa.

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:13.508 position:50% align:center
I might not have a lot
of experience, but...

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:16.219 position:50% align:center
...I can at least try
to back you up a little!

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:24.561 position:50% align:center
Most of the time, I'm afraid
to fight with anyone.

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.563 position:50% align:center
But there's no other choice!

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:29.858 position:50% align:center
It's time to fight
for my ideals!

00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:32.027 position:50% align:center
If I want to see my students
live through this ordeal

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.821 position:50% align:center
and make it back home
to Japan, it's clear.

00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:37.866 position:50% align:center
I, of all people,
can't run away!

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.826 position:50% align:center
Please, Tio!

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.164 position:50% align:center
[TIO] Okay, If you've made up
your mind, then it's settled.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:47.417 position:50% align:center
If this is what you believe
in your heart you must do,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.836 position:50% align:center
who is Master
to stand in your way?

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.880 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:55.425 position:50% align:center
[TIO] All right, let's go
demolish these fools together.

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:56.551 position:50% align:center
[AIKO]
Yes!

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.020 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
The hell?

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:09.189 position:50% align:center
What kinda magic power
is she using?

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:10.482 position:50% align:center
Limit Break?

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:54.192 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:57.779 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:02.367 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME growls]

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:44.200 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
I don't like this.

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.995 position:50% align:center
Her magic power
isn't decreasing at all.

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:06.890 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] My Limit Break isn't
gonna last indefinitely.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.558 position:50% align:center
What should I do?

00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
I need to create some space.

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:31.873 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:45.220 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Burn in hell!

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:57.273 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME panting]

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:03.405 position:50% align:center
[NOINT coughs]

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.871 position:50% align:center
Were you hoping to
take both of us out?

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:17.043 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Heh. Are you
freakin' kidding me?

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:18.712 position:50% align:center
What, do ya think you're funny?

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:20.880 position:50% align:center
I ain't dyin'.
You're the last person

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:23.675 position:50% align:center
I'd make a lovers'
suicide pact with, freak.

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:29.764 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:35.562 position:50% align:center
Oh, is that all you've got left?

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.063 position:50% align:center
Out of options so soon--?

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:55.081 position:50% align:center
[NOINT]
How? With that attack?

00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:58.710 position:50% align:center
This can't be--

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:05.759 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:14.809 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME yells]

00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:16.519 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:21.149 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME yells]

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.871 position:50% align:center
Now let's see if
you can survive this!

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:08.697 position:50% align:center
Not bad, Irregular.

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:26.256 position:50% align:center
I call that Irregular's Fang.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.883 position:50% align:center
I hope she was impressed
by it, at least.

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:36.766 position:50% align:center
Oh, boy.

00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:54.409 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Now, what the
hell happened here?

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:57.162 position:50% align:center
Oh, Ms. Aiko. You
didn't run away, huh?

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:58.955 position:50% align:center
I was going to drop
her off, as you said,

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:01.541 position:50% align:center
but she insisted on
coming to support me.

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:03.251 position:50% align:center
I-- I just--

00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:04.961 position:50% align:center
I just had to do
something to help.

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:06.546 position:50% align:center
I couldn't not.

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:09.924 position:50% align:center
Okay, in any case, it's good to
see that you're both all right.

00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:11.509 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Um, yes!

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:12.927 position:50% align:center
You, as well.

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:15.055 position:50% align:center
I'm so relieved to see you
made it through all right.

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:16.765 position:50% align:center
I'm incredibly relieved.

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:19.017 position:50% align:center
For a moment I thought
I was going to die,

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.645 position:50% align:center
and yet I made it
out alive. I must say,

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:26.983 position:50% align:center
I'm truly impressed by
your teacher, here, Master.

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:28.026 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:29.611 position:50% align:center
[TIO]
Don't look so surprised.

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:31.363 position:50% align:center
You augmented the
power of my breath

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:33.239 position:50% align:center
to such an incredible
degree that it tore down

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:34.616 position:50% align:center
the entire church.

00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:37.369 position:50% align:center
If that's not
impressive, what is?

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:38.370 position:50% align:center
Well, crap.

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:39.954 position:50% align:center
Ms. Aiko, what
exactly did you do?

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:43.166 position:50% align:center
No, hold on. It's
not what you think!

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:45.251 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean to be
so destructive!

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:48.004 position:50% align:center
The church's barrier
was tough to crack so...

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:49.547 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Okay, go on.

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:52.926 position:50% align:center
I was really only trying to
improve Tio's breath somehow.

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:55.845 position:50% align:center
You know, so we could break
the barrier, but then...

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:57.430 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
But, then, what?

00:09:57.514 --> 00:09:58.723 position:50% align:center
[AIKO]
Mm...

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:03.770 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Oh, I get it.
Your Farmer skill, right?

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:06.439 position:50% align:center
That "Fermentation
Acceleration" one.

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:10.068 position:50% align:center
You used that to create methane,
which is highly flammable.

00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:12.070 position:50% align:center
Then you used Tio's
wings to collect the gas

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:15.448 position:50% align:center
into one spot, and then, boom?

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:18.785 position:50% align:center
It blew us away,
too. The thrill!

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:21.579 position:50% align:center
It's been a while since
I felt so close to death.

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
Okay. So not only did you
destroy the barrier,

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.459 position:50% align:center
but you blew up
the whole church, too.

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:29.337 position:50% align:center
In all my long life,
never could I have imagined

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:32.716 position:50% align:center
such an innovative technique.
I'm simply awestruck.

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:35.093 position:50% align:center
No, Nagumo. Don't misunderstand!

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:38.096 position:50% align:center
I promise I really didn't know
it would explode like that!

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:42.100 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to
avoid half-measures.

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:44.477 position:50% align:center
Wait, what happened to
the people at the church?

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:46.354 position:50% align:center
Are they all okay?

00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:49.941 position:50% align:center
Um. Yeah, they probably
blew up with the building.

00:10:50.025 --> 00:10:51.776 position:50% align:center
[TIO]
They seemed to be overconfident,

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.530 position:50% align:center
and it was a surprise attack.
A true stroke of genius.

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:58.199 position:50% align:center
It was a huge explosion,
and their guard was down.

00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:00.243 position:50% align:center
It's not likely they survived.

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:04.039 position:50% align:center
No. You mean... They're dead?

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:07.083 position:50% align:center
I really thought
that I was ready,

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.210 position:50% align:center
but I don't think that I was.

00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:32.150 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
You gonna be okay, Ms. Aiko?

00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:39.199 position:50% align:center
[AIKO]
Mm-hm.

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
[TIO]
Excuse me, Master?

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:42.911 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:44.496 position:50% align:center
There's someone there.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:46.873 position:50% align:center
And it doesn't appear
to be a normal presence.

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:48.166 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:01.137 position:50% align:center
You think he wants us
to follow him?

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:02.681 position:50% align:center
Seems that way.

00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:05.517 position:50% align:center
Well, Master?
What do you propose?

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.310 position:50% align:center
Let me think.

00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:11.022 position:50% align:center
It'd be ideal to meet up
with Yue as soon as possible.

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:12.816 position:50% align:center
Then again, we did come
all the way out here

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:17.278 position:50% align:center
for the Age of God's magic.
So we'd better go.

00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:18.405 position:50% align:center
Ms. Aiko.

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:19.572 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:21.324 position:50% align:center
You're prob'ly not
gonna like this much,

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:23.785 position:50% align:center
but I'm gonna need you
to come along with us.

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.245 position:50% align:center
I don't know what's
gonna happen,

00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:28.164 position:50% align:center
but I do know we have to
figure out who that guy is.

00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:57.193 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] If you can talk,
tell us who you are.

00:12:57.277 --> 00:12:59.320 position:50% align:center
And what it is you want from us.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:26.139 position:50% align:center
Okay, then. Guess
you're a Liberator.

00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:45.784 position:50% align:center
So, um, what is this place?

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:49.329 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Huh?

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:57.045 position:50% align:center
[AIKO whimpers]

00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:59.673 position:50% align:center
This feels like spirit magic.

00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:01.257 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:04.928 position:50% align:center
That's a type of magic that can
manipulate a person's very soul.

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:07.222 position:50% align:center
Certain things are starting
to make sense here.

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:09.933 position:50% align:center
This has to be what Miledi used
to put her soul into a golem

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:11.851 position:50% align:center
in order to survive.

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:19.609 position:50% align:center
Laus Barn, huh?

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:22.904 position:50% align:center
The designer of the Divine
Mountain Great Labyrinth.

00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:26.825 position:50% align:center
Says here:
"To defeat this dungeon,

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:30.620 position:50% align:center
you must have defeated two other
labyrinths before this one.

00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:34.290 position:50% align:center
You must have no faith in God.

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.292 position:50% align:center
And you must also
defeat some effect

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:39.337 position:50% align:center
that is powered
by the force of God.

00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:41.464 position:50% align:center
When these three
conditions are met,

00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:44.884 position:50% align:center
a guide to this location
will appear." I see.

00:14:44.968 --> 00:14:48.179 position:50% align:center
So, when the weird apparition
of that guy showed up,

00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:52.475 position:50% align:center
it must have meant that we had
already defeated this labyrinth.

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:54.811 position:50% align:center
The concept of
the Divine Mountain

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:57.230 position:50% align:center
is to prove that a person
has a strong will

00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:59.399 position:50% align:center
that isn't swayed by God.

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:02.777 position:50% align:center
Ms. Aiko, are you okay?

00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:05.280 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'll be fine.

00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:08.283 position:50% align:center
I gotta admit, this magic
is pretty impressive.

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:11.077 position:50% align:center
Also, if such a thing exists,
then it might mean

00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:12.579 position:50% align:center
there's a kind of magic
that can take us

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:14.706 position:50% align:center
back to Japan, somehow, right?

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:16.124 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Yeah.

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:18.501 position:50% align:center
Not to be rude, Master,
but shouldn't we stop talking

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:19.377 position:50% align:center
and make haste?

00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:20.962 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, you're right!

00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:23.965 position:50% align:center
The royal capital
is still under attack!

00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:27.552 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. I hope everyone is okay.

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:30.055 position:50% align:center
Let's find Yue and the others.

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:41.900 position:50% align:center
[crash]

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:46.488 position:50% align:center
What?

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:57.916 position:50% align:center
[door clicks]

00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:02.379 position:50% align:center
Hey! Shizuku!

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:03.213 position:50% align:center
Quiet, dummy!

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:04.506 position:50% align:center
Yeah, come on!

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:06.549 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Sorry, jeez.

00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:12.847 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:13.848 position:50% align:center
Shizuku?

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:15.642 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Kouki, wise up!

00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:17.811 position:50% align:center
Can't you at least
be a little careful?

00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:19.521 position:50% align:center
I could've been anyone.

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:22.607 position:50% align:center
Did it even occur to you
to ask who was there first?

00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:24.818 position:50% align:center
What if I had meant you harm?

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:26.319 position:50% align:center
We're in the royal palace.

00:16:26.403 --> 00:16:28.822 position:50% align:center
Who here would have
meant me harm?

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:31.991 position:50% align:center
I agree with Kouki.
I think you're being paranoid.

00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:33.410 position:50% align:center
For real.

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:34.619 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU grumbles]

00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:37.205 position:50% align:center
So, what's going on?
And what was that noise?

00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:39.582 position:50% align:center
It sounded like
something big shattered.

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:42.335 position:50% align:center
I don't know,
but I don't like it.

00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:45.588 position:50% align:center
Let's wake everyone up
and go find out.

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:47.841 position:50% align:center
I have a bad feeling
about this.

00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:52.512 position:50% align:center
[KOUKI] Sorry to wake
you all up like this.

00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:54.389 position:50% align:center
But I'm sure you can guess why.

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:57.809 position:50% align:center
You may have heard that loud
shattering sound earlier.

00:16:57.892 --> 00:17:00.770 position:50% align:center
I've no doubt the
palace is safe, but still,

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:02.105 position:50% align:center
we should make sure
there's nothing weird

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:03.565 position:50% align:center
going on around here.

00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:07.027 position:50% align:center
And, just in case there is,
we should stick together.

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:16.661 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Nia.

00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:18.329 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Listen.

00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:22.625 position:50% align:center
[high-pitched ringing]

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:24.127 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.629 position:50% align:center
That sound was the
Great Barrier breaking.

00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:29.090 position:50% align:center
[gasps] That can't be!

00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:31.009 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
The Demons are invading.

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:34.554 position:50% align:center
But how? That seems impossible!

00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:35.764 position:50% align:center
I don't get it.

00:17:35.847 --> 00:17:38.683 position:50% align:center
They got to the royal
capital unnoticed?

00:17:38.767 --> 00:17:41.394 position:50% align:center
[KOUKI] We can figure that
out later, but for right now,

00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:44.397 position:50% align:center
we have to buy time so the
people here can evacuate.

00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:47.025 position:50% align:center
And also, so the army
and knights can regroup.

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:49.694 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute, Kouki.

00:17:49.778 --> 00:17:51.863 position:50% align:center
I think we should find
Meld and the knights,

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:54.532 position:50% align:center
not go off to fight on our own.

00:17:54.616 --> 00:17:55.408 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:56.785 position:50% align:center
So, Nia.

00:17:56.868 --> 00:17:59.287 position:50% align:center
How many Demons do you
think there are out there?

00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:02.665 position:50% align:center
I'd say about 100,000.

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:04.125 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
You see, Kouki?

00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:06.795 position:50% align:center
There's no way we can
fight back against so many.

00:18:06.878 --> 00:18:10.048 position:50% align:center
We need a much larger force
if we want to hold them off.

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:12.467 position:50% align:center
And in order to do that,
don't you think it would be best

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:15.095 position:50% align:center
for us to coordinate
properly with Meld?

00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:20.892 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Mm-hm. Oh, yeah,
I agree with Eri.

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:23.353 position:50% align:center
I think she's really,
really smart, you guys.

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:25.063 position:50% align:center
She doesn't wear
glasses for nothin'!

00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:28.858 position:50% align:center
The glasses are about my
vision, not my intelligence.

00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:32.028 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I gotta say,
I agree with Eri, too.

00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:34.698 position:50% align:center
We just got scared
before and lost our cool.

00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:35.782 position:50% align:center
Kouki?

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:37.075 position:50% align:center
Agreed.

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:39.285 position:50% align:center
At times like this,
we can't rush into action.

00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:41.830 position:50% align:center
It's better to coordinate.

00:18:41.913 --> 00:18:44.124 position:50% align:center
So, let's regroup with Meld.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.380 position:50% align:center
[JOSE]
Thank you for coming.

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:52.298 position:50% align:center
You're aware of the situation?

00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:55.135 position:50% align:center
Yes, we heard from Nia.

00:18:55.218 --> 00:18:58.430 position:50% align:center
So, um. Where is Meld?

00:18:58.513 --> 00:19:00.890 position:50% align:center
The Commander is taking
care of something.

00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:05.311 position:50% align:center
For now, please,
come with me to the center.

00:19:05.395 --> 00:19:07.814 position:50% align:center
As the hero, you're our
leader at the moment.

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:26.124 position:50% align:center
[YUUKA]
Hey, Shizuku, this feels off.

00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:29.502 position:50% align:center
I know. Stay on your guard.

00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:31.504 position:50% align:center
Something's very wrong.

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:37.427 position:50% align:center
Troops! Our present
situation is dire.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.763 position:50% align:center
But I urge you to have no fear.

00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:43.308 position:50% align:center
Let us all bid our hero welcome.

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:48.396 position:50% align:center
Today is the momentous day for
which we have all been created!

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.857 position:50% align:center
Now, hold your swords high!

00:19:55.904 --> 00:19:59.991 position:50% align:center
This beacon signals
the start! Behold!

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:07.874 position:50% align:center

No, Endo!

What the hell is going on here?

[VOICE]
Still standing?

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:57.674 position:50% align:center
I suppose I should be impressed.

00:20:57.757 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't I, Shizuku?

00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:04.055 position:50% align:center
Wha...?

00:21:04.139 --> 00:21:05.640 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Shizuku!

00:21:05.724 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center
Please, you have
to help me, Shizuku!

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:11.521 position:50% align:center
Nia! You okay?

00:21:12.981 --> 00:21:14.733 position:50% align:center

Why, Nia?

00:21:23.658 --> 00:21:27.871 position:50% align:center
How could you do--?

00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:29.622 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:21:33.084 --> 00:21:36.296 position:50% align:center
[VOICE laughs]
This is hilarious.

00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:39.758 position:50% align:center
Not even the great Shizuku
could have seen that coming.

00:21:40.967 --> 00:21:43.261 position:50% align:center
[VOICE]
I timed this out perfectly!

00:21:43.345 --> 00:21:45.889 position:50% align:center
I was right to wait until
the very last moment

00:21:45.972 --> 00:21:48.975 position:50% align:center
to "prepare" her.

00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:52.187 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] Who are you?
What's going on?

00:21:58.109 --> 00:22:01.154 position:50% align:center

Eri?
