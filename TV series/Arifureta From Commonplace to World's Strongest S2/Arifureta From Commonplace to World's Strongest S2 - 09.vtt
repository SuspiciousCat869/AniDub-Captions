00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:14.431 position:50% align:center
Irregular, my name is Noint.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:17.600 position:50% align:center
And as god's apostle,
it is my task to remove

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.228 position:50% align:center
unnecessary pieces
from the board.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.069 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well I'd like
to see you try.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.159 position:50% align:center
Bring it on, puppet of "God."

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.092 position:50% align:center
[LILIANA] At this hour, everyone
should still be asleep.

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:16.511 position:50% align:center
I say we head to
Shizuku's room first.

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:20.015 position:50% align:center
What is that? So loud!

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:23.893 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me!

00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:28.106 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:32.527 position:50% align:center
The Great Barrier.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.112 position:50% align:center
It's been shattered!

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:39.034 position:50% align:center
It's supposed to be
nearly impenetrable.

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:40.744 position:50% align:center
We're exposed to attack.

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:43.872 position:50% align:center
[TIO]
Can you hear me?

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:44.748 position:50% align:center
[KAORI]
Tio?

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:46.041 position:50% align:center
[TIO]
Oh, good!

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:48.376 position:50% align:center
I'm picking up your voice
loud and clear.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.003 position:50% align:center
Master's done it again!

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:52.922 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You're coming through
well on our side, too.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.008 position:50% align:center
[YUE] Tio, do you know
what's happening?

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:58.011 position:50% align:center
[TIO] Yes, a massive army
of Demons and monsters

00:02:58.094 --> 00:02:59.387 position:50% align:center
are gathering.

00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:01.806 position:50% align:center
They're about one kilometer
south of the capital.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.226 position:50% align:center
And that one white
dragon is among them.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.396 position:50% align:center
Its fire breath is what
pierced the barrier just now.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.899 position:50% align:center
And you're certain
they're to the south?

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.233 position:50% align:center
But how?

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:14.903 position:50% align:center
They'd need to have
crossed the entire nation.

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:18.865 position:50% align:center
A whole army couldn't just
sneak past border patrol.

00:03:18.948 --> 00:03:20.283 position:50% align:center
Spatial magic.

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:21.368 position:50% align:center
[KAORI]
Right.

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:22.994 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
That explains it.

00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:25.705 position:50% align:center
Well, regardless, we must
meet up with Shizuku

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:28.500 position:50% align:center
--and the others--
--[YUE] No.

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:30.543 position:50% align:center
We split up here.

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:32.295 position:50% align:center
But you can go if you want.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.005 position:50% align:center
[LILIANA]
I don't understand.

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:35.090 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:40.095 position:50% align:center
[YUE] The Demon riding
the white dragon is the one

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:42.222 position:50% align:center
that hurt Hajime.

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:43.598 position:50% align:center
And I want a piece of him.

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:46.226 position:50% align:center
Whoa, I know you're
mad, Yue, but...

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:47.519 position:50% align:center
What, are you not?

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:49.104 position:50% align:center
Oh, I am!

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:53.024 position:50% align:center
He could cry and beg for mercy,
and I'd still beat him silly!

00:03:53.108 --> 00:03:54.609 position:50% align:center
You guys go on ahead.

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:56.611 position:50% align:center
The two of us are gonna
pay that stupid lizard

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:58.154 position:50% align:center
and its master a visit.

00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:59.447 position:50% align:center
Someone's gotta
teach 'em a lesson,

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.991 position:50% align:center
so we're bowing out here.
See ya later!

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:05.412 position:50% align:center
[YUE] And a word of warning:
don't try to get in our way.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:06.579 position:50% align:center
[LILIANA]
What-- Hey!

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:35.025 position:50% align:center
[TIO]
Hmm...

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.693 position:50% align:center
What to do, what do do.

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:37.777 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
Tio.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.447 position:50% align:center
Have you found the scumbag?

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50% align:center
Where is that pompous,
no-good Demon

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:43.908 position:50% align:center
with the shit-eating grin?

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:45.577 position:50% align:center
You're worked up.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.788 position:50% align:center
Though I can't blame you,
I dislike him as well.

00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:51.374 position:50% align:center
But you didn't have to
leave Princess Liliana.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.918 position:50% align:center
She must feel so abandoned.

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:55.128 position:50% align:center
That's not important.

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.880 position:50% align:center
Don't sweat the small stuff.

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:58.465 position:50% align:center
[TIO]
Uh...

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:02.552 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Hey, Tio! Get over here, now!

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:05.013 position:50% align:center
Right away, Master,
but what's the trouble?

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:06.556 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Got a tough opponent.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.808 position:50% align:center
I need you to take
Ms. Aiko off my hands.

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:11.770 position:50% align:center
I can't fight at 100%
while I'm carrying her.

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:12.937 position:50% align:center
Understood!

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:14.522 position:50% align:center
I'll be there momentarily!

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.908 position:50% align:center
Yue, jump now!

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:42.258 position:50% align:center
[FREID] I knew you had some sort
of cursed precognition ability.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:43.927 position:50% align:center
Though I'd love to know
how you survived

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center
our last encounter.

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:48.264 position:50% align:center
Seems that white-haired
man you work with

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.725 position:50% align:center
has as a penchant for
survival that's as dangerous

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:52.227 position:50% align:center
as it is terrifying.

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:59.818 position:50% align:center
[DEMONS growling]

00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:08.076 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, I suppose I'll do
away with his companions.

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.162 position:50% align:center
We've met one too
many times already.

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:13.123 position:50% align:center
Well, I'd like to see you try.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.417 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, I'd like
to see you try, too!

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:19.546 position:50% align:center
If you insist.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:24.426 position:50% align:center
[SHEA chuckles]

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:31.224 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:44.946 position:50% align:center
Damn you.

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:47.782 position:50% align:center
[DEMON A]
Sir Freid, over there!

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:04.174 position:50% align:center
[FREID]
Listen up, men!

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.801 position:50% align:center
The blond-haired caster is mine!

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:10.513 position:50% align:center
Black Eagle squadron
will take the rabbitman!

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:13.016 position:50% align:center
They'll be far less
of a threat divided!

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:14.726 position:50% align:center
[DEMONS]
Yes, sir!

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:16.311 position:50% align:center
I don't care who's first!

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:17.979 position:50% align:center
You're both gonna pay!

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:31.326 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Yue!

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:32.952 position:50% align:center
Think we're gonna
have to split up!

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:43.880 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] You smile like you
haven't got a care in the world.

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:45.382 position:50% align:center
You sicken me!

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:49.386 position:50% align:center
I'll tear you limb from limb and
drag you before your man!

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.262 position:50% align:center
Okay, have we met before?

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:52.931 position:50% align:center
You've clearly got
a personal grudge,

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:55.058 position:50% align:center
and I don't have a clue why.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.393 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] Do you remember
a Demon woman

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:58.853 position:50% align:center
with beautiful red hair?

00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:00.063 position:50% align:center
Well, you'd better!

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:03.066 position:50% align:center
You murdered her in
the Orcus Labyrinth!

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:06.528 position:50% align:center
Oh! Yeah, her! I remember!

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:09.823 position:50% align:center
Cattleya, the woman
your group killed,

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:11.616 position:50% align:center
was my fiancÃ©e!

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.410 position:50% align:center
Oh, I guess that makes sense.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:14.744 position:50% align:center
So what?

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:16.371 position:50% align:center
So I hate you!

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:18.289 position:50% align:center
She was so kind and smart.

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:20.959 position:50% align:center
She put her nation
before everything else.

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:22.210 position:50% align:center
And yet you--

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:24.337 position:50% align:center
[SHEA] I don't really
care about any of that.

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:25.588 position:50% align:center
You what?!

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:27.132 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
If dying was such a big deal,

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:29.009 position:50% align:center
she shouldn't have
fought at all.

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:30.760 position:50% align:center
And plus, she was the
one that picked the fight

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:32.637 position:50% align:center
in the first place.

00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:35.056 position:50% align:center
Hajime even gave her
a chance to run.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.142 position:50% align:center
He didn't have to
be that generous.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.895 position:50% align:center
I get it, we killed
someone that you loved.

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:43.648 position:50% align:center
I'd be worried if you
didn't hate us for that.

00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:45.942 position:50% align:center
But I don't have the patience
to listen to sob stories

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:48.111 position:50% align:center
about every single
person we've killed.

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:49.821 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:51.948 position:50% align:center
[SHEA] I mean, would
you listen to that stuff?

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:53.908 position:50% align:center
You wanna hear about their
hopes and their dreams

00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:56.036 position:50% align:center
and their favorite color?

00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:57.370 position:50% align:center
Of course not.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:01.624 position:50% align:center
Silence!

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:03.418 position:50% align:center
I will avenge Cattleya!

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:12.510 position:50% align:center
[SHEA giggles]

00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:13.720 position:50% align:center
[DEMONS yell]

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:17.349 position:50% align:center
Now don't get in close range!
Just back up!

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:19.726 position:50% align:center
Then use your magic
and Petrifying Needles!

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:21.019 position:50% align:center
Oh, cool plan.

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:23.646 position:50% align:center
Be a shame if
somebody ruined it!

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.827 position:50% align:center
What a bizarre tactic
that she's using.

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:39.162 position:50% align:center
Ascend!

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.747 position:50% align:center
Attack from above, beyond
the reach of her chain,

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.248 position:50% align:center
and she'll be powerless!

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:43.333 position:50% align:center
[DEMONS]
Sir!

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.923 position:50% align:center
Yeah, right!

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:57.430 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
Surprise!

00:09:57.514 --> 00:09:59.015 position:50% align:center
I've got you now, you're--

00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:03.436 position:50% align:center
Bam!

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.147 position:50% align:center
Damn it!

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:08.483 position:50% align:center
[SHEA yells]

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:14.322 position:50% align:center
[BLACK EAGLE] We did it!
She'll be petrified in a second.

00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:17.742 position:50% align:center
I admit, I messed up.
But luckily, I've got this.

00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:20.870 position:50% align:center
My very own
Quasi-Restoration Magic!

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.957 position:50% align:center
[BLACK EAGLE]
Are you serious?!

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.084 position:50% align:center
Here I come!

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:35.176 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] Taste my lightning
crashing from the sky!

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.262 position:50% align:center
Your luck's run out!

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:38.888 position:50% align:center
Dodge this if you can!

00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:43.727 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
Dodge left. Right. Back.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.061 position:50% align:center
And front!

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:47.647 position:50% align:center
This is absurd!
What are you?!

00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:51.401 position:50% align:center
Just your friendly neighborhood
bunny-eared girl!
