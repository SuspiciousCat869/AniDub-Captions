[HAJIME]
I kill my enemies.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.182 position:50% align:center
No matter what they are.

00:00:57.265 --> 00:00:59.225 position:50% align:center
Even if they happen to be gods.

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:44.914 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] Your majesty,
the delays are indeed

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.416 position:50% align:center
rather regrettable.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.044 position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, we are quite
relieved to hear the Hero

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:50.545 position:50% align:center
is on his way back.

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:52.130 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:55.425 position:50% align:center
I hear talk that the demons are
becoming more active as well.

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:58.553 position:50% align:center
We will be requiring the
Hero's powers very soon.

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:02.724 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] Is something wrong,
Princess Liliana?

00:03:02.807 --> 00:03:05.602 position:50% align:center
I cannot help but notice
that you seem ill at ease.

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:10.565 position:50% align:center
Who, me? No, Pope Ishtar.
I'm feeling all right.

00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:13.193 position:50% align:center
Kouki and the others, they
were summoned to our world

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:15.236 position:50% align:center
from their own by an act of God.

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:17.822 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:24.037 position:50% align:center
The Hero has now returned.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:29.668 position:50% align:center
Why were they summoned?

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:33.713 position:50% align:center
To protect the humans of
this world from the demons.

00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:36.216 position:50% align:center
Without a way to go back
to their original world,

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.761 position:50% align:center
Kouki and the others had no
choice but to obey God's will.

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:41.471 position:50% align:center
While they were
training to go to war,

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:43.515 position:50% align:center
a horrible accident happened.

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.517 position:50% align:center
No! No more.

00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:54.442 position:50% align:center
Hey, Lily!

00:03:58.697 --> 00:03:59.739 position:50% align:center
[LILIANA]
Shizuku!

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:15.714 position:50% align:center
It took you so long to return
from the Great Orcus Labyrinth.

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:17.298 position:50% align:center
I was starting to get worried.

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:19.342 position:50% align:center
No need, we're fine, see?

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:20.969 position:50% align:center
How is everyone else?

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:22.887 position:50% align:center
[LILIANA] They're well,
the Second Party members

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:24.973 position:50% align:center
were all training as hard
as they could every day

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:26.808 position:50% align:center
that you were gone.

00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:29.728 position:50% align:center
They said they refused
to just sit idly by.

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:32.022 position:50% align:center
Always relying on Kouki
and the rest of you.

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:34.232 position:50% align:center
They wanted to be
strong enough to fight, too.

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:43.992 position:50% align:center
Hey, there, Eri!
Want something to drink?

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:45.035 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:49.414 position:50% align:center
I'm fine. Let's go get a drink.

00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:52.000 position:50% align:center
[LILIANA] Shizuku, if you
all hadn't returned,

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.336 position:50% align:center
they swore that they would
go out and track you down.

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.297 position:50% align:center
It's obvious they genuinely
care about their friends.

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:01.051 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's the matter with you?

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:02.844 position:50% align:center
Why are you acting so moody?

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:05.555 position:50% align:center
Were the monsters you saw
down there really that bad?

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:07.599 position:50% align:center
It's him, not them.

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.726 position:50% align:center
He's worse than the monsters.

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.144 position:50% align:center
[KENTAROU]
Kousuke!

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:12.771 position:50% align:center
Kousuke, you in here?

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.647 position:50% align:center
Where'd he go?

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:17.359 position:50% align:center
Now that you mention it,
I haven't seen him in a while.

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:18.735 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kousuke!

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:20.028 position:50% align:center
You hiding?

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:21.446 position:50% align:center
--[KENTAROU] Kousuke!
--[MELD] Kousuke!

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:23.490 position:50% align:center
Um, I'm right here, guys.

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:25.075 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.619 position:50% align:center
Blending into the
walls, as usual.

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:28.912 position:50% align:center
Can I cry now?

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:32.499 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry I worried you.

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to see everyone's
in good spirits, though.

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.587 position:50% align:center
[LILIANA]
Yes. What about Kaori?

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:41.549 position:50% align:center
Lily, we should talk about that.

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:48.348 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see.

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:51.017 position:50% align:center
So, you're saying
Kaori is with Nagumo.

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.477 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.022 position:50% align:center
Do you think that might by
why Kouki seems preoccupied?

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:59.025 position:50% align:center
Uh... Well, that's
probably part of it,

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:02.946 position:50% align:center
but Nagumo ended up
saving Kouki again, so...

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:04.114 position:50% align:center
[LILIANA]
I see.

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:07.117 position:50% align:center
That said, he is the Hero.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.744 position:50% align:center
We can't let him stay like
this for too much longer.

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:11.121 position:50% align:center
Yes, indeed.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:14.457 position:50% align:center
But, if it comes down to it,
I'll handle him.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.376 position:50% align:center
[LILIANA]
I'm so relieved.

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:19.462 position:50% align:center
I'm genuinely happy to
hear that Nagumo is safe.

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:22.007 position:50% align:center
It would've been best if
he'd come back with us.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.342 position:50% align:center
He said he's searching
for a way home.

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:26.469 position:50% align:center
Some other pathway to our world.

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:29.305 position:50% align:center
I admit I'm a little
disappointed I couldn't see him.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.974 position:50% align:center
You'd be surprised if you did.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:33.727 position:50% align:center
He looks totally different,
among other things.

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:38.273 position:50% align:center
By now, I'm sure he's...

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:52.328 position:50% align:center
[SHEA] It's really
awful out there, Tio.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:55.749 position:50% align:center
If it wasn't for Hajime's Brise,
we'd be in deep trouble.

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:57.417 position:50% align:center
You're right about that, Shea.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.045 position:50% align:center
This is no place I'd willingly
enter if I had any choice

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:01.421 position:50% align:center
in the matter.

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.882 position:50% align:center
It's very different from
the last time I was here.

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:06.593 position:50% align:center
It's much cooler, and my
eyes don't even hurt!

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:08.178 position:50% align:center
Papa is so awesome!

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:09.387 position:50% align:center
Well, I agree.

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:12.057 position:50% align:center
Papa Hajime is awesome, indeed.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.892 position:50% align:center
Do you want some
cold water, Myu?

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:17.395 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Yes, please! I am very thirsty!

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:18.772 position:50% align:center
Hey, Shirasaki.

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:25.028 position:50% align:center
Or-- Kaori, please stop
calling me Papa Hajime.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.447 position:50% align:center
It makes me feel
so uncomfortable.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.240 position:50% align:center
Huh? But that's
what Myu calls you,

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:30.825 position:50% align:center
and you don't seem to mind then.

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:32.369 position:50% align:center
That's way different.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.829 position:50% align:center
Myu is a kid, but having
a classmate call me Papa

00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:36.748 position:50% align:center
is just awkward and weird.

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:39.250 position:50% align:center
Okay. I won't call
you that, then.

00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:41.670 position:50% align:center
But just you wait. One day,
when I have a baby,

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:42.921 position:50% align:center
I'll teach them to--

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:45.674 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
Sorry. I have prior claim.

00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:46.883 position:50% align:center
He promised me.

00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:51.638 position:50% align:center
I have his word that he'll
take me to meet his parents.

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:55.100 position:50% align:center
Our baby-making days
are on the horizon.

00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:59.771 position:50% align:center
We have plans for a date
in Hajime's hometown, too.

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.484 position:50% align:center
[KAORI] There's so much
that I know about Hajime

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:05.902 position:50% align:center
that you don't, Yue!

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:09.572 position:50% align:center
Like his future aspirations,
his hobbies.

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:11.574 position:50% align:center
For example, do you
even know what Hajime's

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:13.702 position:50% align:center
favorite anime and manga are?

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:17.038 position:50% align:center
Well, I um...
That doesn't matter anymore.

00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:19.040 position:50% align:center
Those things don't
exist in this world.

00:08:19.124 --> 00:08:20.583 position:50% align:center
[KAORI]
Really?

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:23.294 position:50% align:center
Even though Hajime totally looks
like an anime character now?

00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:25.130 position:50% align:center
His weapons are familiar, too.

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:27.382 position:50% align:center
Like his new one.
What'd he call it again?

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:28.591 position:50% align:center
The Cross Bit, was it?

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.051 position:50% align:center
That's totally based
on the Funnel from that

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:31.344 position:50% align:center
one show, right?

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.305 position:50% align:center
Please. Please shut up.

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:37.559 position:50% align:center
[laughs] How can
you act like you've won

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:40.020 position:50% align:center
when you know nothing
about the things he loves?

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:42.605 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
Bold words, Kaori.

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:44.733 position:50% align:center
I can tell you
something he loves.

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:47.444 position:50% align:center
Something much more meaningful:

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:48.862 position:50% align:center
What he likes in bed.

00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center
[KAORI]
What he likes in b-bed?

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.910 position:50% align:center
So, you've already...?

00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:58.663 position:50% align:center
[YUE] Yes, let that sink in,
then go cry about it.

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:02.375 position:50% align:center
[MYU] Big Sister Yue
and Big Sister Kaori

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:03.918 position:50% align:center
are always fighting!

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:07.339 position:50% align:center
I don't like it when the big
sisters are mean to each other!

00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:08.798 position:50% align:center
Are you happy now?

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:11.051 position:50% align:center
Aren't you ashamed of acting
like that in front of Myu?

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:13.011 position:50% align:center
What kind of example
are you two setting?

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:15.555 position:50% align:center
Please act your age
and refrain yourselves!

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:18.516 position:50% align:center
For once, Shea makes
a very good point.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.894 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry, Myu, Shea.

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:27.984 position:50% align:center
Master, look, there appears
to be a disturbance up ahead.

00:09:30.862 --> 00:09:32.906 position:50% align:center
[TIO]
Oh, those are sand worms.

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:35.450 position:50% align:center
They are exceedingly common
in the Gruen Desert,

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:38.328 position:50% align:center
but something about their
behavior seems off.

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:42.499 position:50% align:center
What are they doing?

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:45.502 position:50% align:center
It looks like they're having
trouble making up their minds.

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:47.671 position:50% align:center
Like they're wary
of eating their prey.

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:49.881 position:50% align:center
Fair assessment, yeah.

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:51.299 position:50% align:center
Is that a thing with them?

00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:53.426 position:50% align:center
No, they literally eat anything.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.928 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine they
would ever hesitate

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:56.721 position:50% align:center
in front of a meal, normally.

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:06.398 position:50% align:center
Hold on!

[KAORI] It's dangerous!
The danger is dangerous!

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:43.101 position:50% align:center
I'm clinging to you because
of the dangerous danger!

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:46.896 position:50% align:center
Damn you, Kaori, a surprise
attack to get ahead of me?

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.231 position:50% align:center
Touché, indeed.

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:50.608 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to.

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:52.569 position:50% align:center
I had the purest
of intentions, I swear!

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.404 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to try playing
the damsel in distress

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:55.989 position:50% align:center
for once!

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:58.158 position:50% align:center
[YUE] And also to perhaps enjoy
a little Hajime if you could?

00:10:58.241 --> 00:10:59.242 position:50% align:center
[KAORI]
Yes, exactly.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:00.994 position:50% align:center
Wait, no!
Don't phrase it like that!

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:03.663 position:50% align:center
I'm not a loose woman
like you, Yue!

00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:05.040 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
You're calling me loose?

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:08.084 position:50% align:center
Well, I can't deny I am
when I'm alone with Hajime.

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:09.919 position:50% align:center
Will you two shut up
for one second?

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:12.756 position:50% align:center
Also, Yue, please keep the
conversation family friendly.

00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:18.219 position:50% align:center
Ah! We're going
backwards real fast!

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:19.721 position:50% align:center
[KAORI]
That's right! Papa Hajime

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:20.972 position:50% align:center
is a good driver, isn't he?

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:22.515 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] I told you to
stop calling me Papa!

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:24.351 position:50% align:center
[YUE] Hajime, I want
to have your babies.

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:25.935 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
Hey! Save the baby-making fun

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.854 position:50% align:center
for when we get
to the inn, please!

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:29.064 position:50% align:center
[TIO]
Will there be fun for me too?

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:30.357 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] I'll throw you
out into the desert.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.067 position:50% align:center
[TIO] Why are you harsh
to me and no one else?

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.570 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it, I've never
used this weapon before.

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:42.869 position:50% align:center
Wow, I wasn't even aware
Brise had something fancy

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:44.788 position:50% align:center
--like that.
--Brilliant, Hajime.

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:46.873 position:50% align:center
Master truly is the greatest.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:59.302 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Dammit! Make sure
Myu doesn't see this.

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:04.974 position:50% align:center
[TIO] All right, now let's
find out what's going on.

00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:10.397 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh, they're looking at us.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.691 position:50% align:center
That could be a bad thing,
right, Hajime?

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:15.443 position:50% align:center
It looks like a much bigger
crowd now than it did before.

00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:17.112 position:50% align:center
Watch and learn, ladies.

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:38.883 position:50% align:center
Hajime, look! There!

00:12:42.721 --> 00:12:44.389 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
A person?

00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:46.933 position:50% align:center
I wonder if that's what
the sandworms were after.

00:12:47.017 --> 00:12:49.352 position:50% align:center
Don't you think we
should go over there

00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:50.770 position:50% align:center
to see if he's okay?

00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:53.356 position:50% align:center
I dunno, we have Myu with us.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.941 position:50% align:center
That makes things much riskier.

00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:57.027 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Don't worry, I'll be okay!

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.862 position:50% align:center
You feel compelled to save them?

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:00.822 position:50% align:center
I mean, you are a
Priest, after all.

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:07.662 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Myu, stay in Brise with Shea.

00:13:07.746 --> 00:13:09.497 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank you!

00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:11.916 position:50% align:center
I'm not being altruistic.
I'm curious.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.209 position:50% align:center
Why didn't they eat him?

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:22.385 position:50% align:center
What the heck?

00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:31.019 position:50% align:center
A mana overload?

00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:33.605 position:50% align:center
An ingested poison,
causing this person's mana

00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:34.814 position:50% align:center
to go berserk?

00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:37.192 position:50% align:center
Hang on. Mana overload?

00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:39.736 position:50% align:center
[KAORI] I'm not certain,
but it seems like he's ingested

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:41.237 position:50% align:center
some kind of poison.

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:42.989 position:50% align:center
It's causing him to be
in a state referred to

00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:44.532 position:50% align:center
as mana overload.

00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:47.702 position:50% align:center
[TIO]
So, he's got too much mana?

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:50.246 position:50% align:center
His body seems unable
to release the excess mana.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.207 position:50% align:center
So the forced overload
coming from inside him

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
is causing pressure to build.

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.710 position:50% align:center
His systems are
unable to handle it.

00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:57.712 position:50% align:center
If we don't do something,
his organs and arteries

00:13:57.796 --> 00:14:00.340 position:50% align:center
will rupture.

00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:03.843 position:50% align:center
Heaven's blessing,
I hereby request recurrence.

00:14:03.927 --> 00:14:06.179 position:50% align:center
Grant him... Consecration!

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:09.891 position:50% align:center
My spell didn't have any effect.

00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:11.309 position:50% align:center
Why, though?

00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:13.186 position:50% align:center
Could that mean it's dissolved
too deeply in his body

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:14.646 position:50% align:center
to be cleansed?

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:18.942 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
Kaori?

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:23.196 position:50% align:center
[KAORI] May the grace
of divine light bless you.

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.990 position:50% align:center
May you be purified
in this holy sanctuary.

00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:28.743 position:50% align:center
No evil shall pass
while I hold the gates.

00:14:28.827 --> 00:14:29.994 position:50% align:center
Sanctorum!

00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:34.708 position:50% align:center
The high-rank light
magic, Sanctorum.

00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:37.419 position:50% align:center
It allows the caster
to transfer some mana--

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:39.337 position:50% align:center
To move it from one
person to another

00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:41.339 position:50% align:center
to prevent mana depletion.

00:14:41.423 --> 00:14:42.507 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.092 position:50% align:center
It can also be used
to forcefully drain

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:45.343 position:50% align:center
a person's mana.

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:47.137 position:50% align:center
It seems like that's how
she's using it now--

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.347 position:50% align:center
to siphon off some
of this man's excess.

00:14:49.431 --> 00:14:50.807 position:50% align:center
Let's hope it works.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.225 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:54.561 position:50% align:center
And the drained mana goes
into the Holy Crystal ring

00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:55.770 position:50% align:center
I gave her.

00:15:11.286 --> 00:15:14.122 position:50% align:center
I don't think he's in immediate,
mortal danger anymore,

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:17.292 position:50% align:center
but the root cause
hasn't been resolved yet.

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:19.794 position:50% align:center
If I drain too much of it,
then there's the danger

00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:21.921 position:50% align:center
of death by emaciation.

00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:24.716 position:50% align:center
So, I've depleted just enough
to relieve the pressure.

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:26.885 position:50% align:center
So he's still at risk.

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:29.179 position:50% align:center
And unless we act,
it's only a matter of time

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
before he goes into
mana overload again.

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:33.558 position:50% align:center
There's also a chance the
fatigue could cause him

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:35.810 position:50% align:center
to deteriorate and die.

00:15:35.894 --> 00:15:37.145 position:50% align:center
I've never seen
symptoms like these

00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:39.397 position:50% align:center
in any of the materials
I've studied.

00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:41.733 position:50% align:center
Yue, Tio, do you have any ideas?

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:47.238 position:50% align:center
--No?
--[HAJIME] Kaori.

00:15:47.322 --> 00:15:50.658 position:50% align:center
Just in case, do a
diagnosis on us, too.

00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:53.495 position:50% align:center
If this is an unknown disease,
it could be airborne,

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:54.913 position:50% align:center
so we should make sure.

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:09.135 position:50% align:center
Oh, my goodness, a goddess?

00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:12.097 position:50% align:center
I see. I must have
died back there.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.933 position:50% align:center
Now my time has
come to meet God.

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:17.811 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear goddess.

00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:19.270 position:50% align:center
--[BIZE grunts]
--Hajime!

00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:21.940 position:50% align:center
Stop spewing that
nonsense and get up already.

00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:23.191 position:50% align:center
You're still alive.

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:26.194 position:50% align:center
So, I didn't die?

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:28.655 position:50% align:center
I was certain that would
be the end of me.

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:30.198 position:50% align:center
But God had other plans.

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:32.409 position:50% align:center
I suppose I haven't
been forsaken yet.

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:34.911 position:50% align:center
Hajime, I think it would
be best if we brought him

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.287 position:50% align:center
into the car.

00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:38.748 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Agreed, it's too hot out here.

00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:44.004 position:50% align:center
[BIZE]
It's not hot.

00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:45.672 position:50% align:center
Where am I?

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.966 position:50% align:center
Is this a divine sanctuary?

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:49.968 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Here you go.

00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:51.386 position:50% align:center
Have some water.

00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:55.682 position:50% align:center
Wha--? Cold water?

00:16:58.226 --> 00:17:00.520 position:50% align:center
[BIZE] First of all,
thank you for saving my life.

00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:02.689 position:50% align:center
If I had died out there,
everything I hold dear

00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:04.816 position:50% align:center
would surely be wiped away.

00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:08.028 position:50% align:center
Oh. My name is
Bize Feuward Zengen.

00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:09.654 position:50% align:center
I am the son of the duke.

00:17:09.738 --> 00:17:12.407 position:50% align:center
Lanzwi Feuward Zengen of Ankaji.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.159 position:50% align:center
The Dukedom of Ankaji?

00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:16.327 position:50% align:center
An important trade
hub for seafood.

00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:19.581 position:50% align:center
It comes there from Erisen,
the city on the ocean.

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:22.417 position:50% align:center
And Myu was born
and raised in Erisen, too.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.794 position:50% align:center
My Mama is waiting for me there!

00:17:24.878 --> 00:17:26.087 position:50% align:center
How convenient.

00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:27.630 position:50% align:center
If I remember correctly, Master,

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:29.758 position:50% align:center
we were headed toward
Ankaji, weren't we?

00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:31.593 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Yeah, that's right.

00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:33.386 position:50% align:center
From what the man says,
it sounds like the town

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.430 position:50% align:center
is in a bit of trouble.

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:38.224 position:50% align:center
Tell us about what's
going on, then.

00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:41.102 position:50% align:center
A few days ago,
citizens all over Ankaji

00:17:41.186 --> 00:17:43.897 position:50% align:center
began to collapse
from a high fever.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.607 position:50% align:center
A poison that causes
mana overload

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.734 position:50% align:center
was found in our drinking water.

00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:50.320 position:50% align:center
Our oasis was
polluted by the stuff.

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:52.864 position:50% align:center
The oasis is protected,
maintained, and managed

00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:54.532 position:50% align:center
with the utmost care.

00:17:54.616 --> 00:17:56.284 position:50% align:center
No one knows how
it got poisoned,

00:17:56.368 --> 00:17:57.827 position:50% align:center
or who did it, if anyone.

00:17:57.911 --> 00:18:00.622 position:50% align:center
However, there is an
antidote to the poison.

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:03.083 position:50% align:center
It involves a special
mineral called Stillstone.

00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:05.251 position:50% align:center
This is exceedingly rare.

00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:08.088 position:50% align:center
When it's ingested, Stillstone
calms a person's mana

00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:09.339 position:50% align:center
a great deal.

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:11.883 position:50% align:center
It can only be mined
from the Gruen Volcano,

00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:13.760 position:50% align:center
which is quite dangerous.

00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:16.054 position:50% align:center
The Gruen Volcano?
Yes, it is!

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:18.848 position:50% align:center
[BIZE] And now, all the skilled
adventurers of Ankaji

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:20.558 position:50% align:center
have fallen ill.

00:18:20.642 --> 00:18:22.227 position:50% align:center
And the average adventurer?

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.689 position:50% align:center
They wouldn't get past the
sandstorm around the volcano.

00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:27.941 position:50% align:center
Powerful adventurers
are rare, too.

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:29.693 position:50% align:center
There's no time to find one.

00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:31.945 position:50% align:center
We're almost out of
safe drinking water.

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:34.781 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] So, in a nutshell, you
set out to track down help,

00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:36.157 position:50% align:center
then you collapsed, too.

00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:39.035 position:50% align:center
so Ankaji is in
deep trouble now.

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:41.287 position:50% align:center
Someone just needs
to cleanse the oasis

00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:43.123 position:50% align:center
and bring Stillstone
from the volcano

00:18:43.206 --> 00:18:45.375 position:50% align:center
to cure the afflicted
citizens, right?

00:18:48.253 --> 00:18:50.005 position:50% align:center
I see it now!

00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:52.048 position:50% align:center
You seem like
Gold-ranked adventurers!

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:53.925 position:50% align:center
And you are a goddess,
aren't you?

00:18:54.009 --> 00:18:56.720 position:50% align:center
This must truly be
the will of God!

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:59.097 position:50% align:center
He must have sent these
goddesses to save us!

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.890 position:50% align:center
The will of God, huh?

00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:02.058 position:50% align:center
Yes, indeed.

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:04.185 position:50% align:center
Therefore, I ask you,

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:09.024 position:50% align:center
as deputy of the Duke of Ankaji,
if you're able and willing...

00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:11.735 position:50% align:center
I beg you, please aid us
in this enterprise!

00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:20.744 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Papa.

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:22.495 position:50% align:center
Aren't you going to save them?

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:24.998 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Myu.

00:19:27.876 --> 00:19:31.629 position:50% align:center
Well, we were planning
to stop by Ankaji anyway.

00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:34.466 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm so glad!

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:37.177 position:50% align:center
We're going to get busy
again, and I like it.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.970 position:50% align:center
Let's hurry up and get there!

00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:40.555 position:50% align:center
Yay! Fun!

00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:44.392 position:50% align:center
We would prefer that you
go directly to the volcano,

00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:47.270 position:50% align:center
but we should stop first
in the royal capital.

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:48.688 position:50% align:center
We'll get water there--

00:19:48.772 --> 00:19:51.274 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] There's no need
to go to the royal capital.

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:53.693 position:50% align:center
We don't have to worry
about getting more water.

00:19:53.777 --> 00:19:55.445 position:50% align:center
We're heading to Ankaji now.

00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:57.864 position:50% align:center
Don't have to worry?

00:19:57.947 --> 00:19:59.282 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Isn't that right, Yue?

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:01.493 position:50% align:center
Yes, Hajime.

00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:03.036 position:50% align:center
[KAORI]
Oh, come on!

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:05.413 position:50% align:center
Can you stop drifting off into
your own little world together?

00:20:05.497 --> 00:20:06.831 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
I know, right?

00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:08.291 position:50% align:center
The two of them are always
leaving everyone else out.

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:09.417 position:50% align:center
Not fair!

00:20:09.501 --> 00:20:11.169 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Yeah, no fair!

00:20:23.014 --> 00:20:24.182 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
General Freid!

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:25.809 position:50% align:center
Is it true about Cattleya?

00:20:25.892 --> 00:20:26.976 position:50% align:center
She was defeated?

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:29.396 position:50% align:center
[FREID]
Yes, Mikhail.

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:30.647 position:50% align:center
No, no, it can't be true!

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.857 position:50% align:center
Cattleya could not
have perished!

00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:36.319 position:50% align:center
She was strong, with all
those monsters at her side!

00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:39.989 position:50% align:center
The mission at the town
of Ur was a failure, as well.

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:41.199 position:50% align:center
Not Ur, too.

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:43.201 position:50% align:center
[FREID] The operations
were a partial success.

00:20:43.284 --> 00:20:45.286 position:50% align:center
Sixty thousand monsters
were recruited,

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:46.788 position:50% align:center
poised to lay waste
to the town and kill

00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:48.206 position:50% align:center
the Fertility Goddess.

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:51.251 position:50% align:center
But then an Irregular
crushed our plan.

00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:52.961 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
An Irregular?

00:20:53.044 --> 00:20:56.589 position:50% align:center
Four individuals crushed
the entire monster army.

00:20:56.673 --> 00:21:00.176 position:50% align:center
Reiss, who was on the mission,
lost an arm in the fight.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.637 position:50% align:center
Reiss, too? That's impossible.

00:21:02.721 --> 00:21:05.557 position:50% align:center
[FREID]
The four Irregulars departed Ur

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center
and headed straight to
the Great Orcus Labyrinth.

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:11.438 position:50% align:center
Just when Cattleya was
about to encounter the Hero.

00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:14.524 position:50% align:center
So, then, these
Irregulars killed her?

00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:16.568 position:50% align:center
Our enemies are
stronger than we thought,

00:21:16.651 --> 00:21:19.946 position:50% align:center
so I must travel to
the volcano at once.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:23.533 position:50% align:center
I will acquire a new Age of God
magic and grow stronger,

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:25.702 position:50% align:center
whatever the cost!

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:27.328 position:50% align:center
General Freid.

00:21:27.412 --> 00:21:29.622 position:50% align:center
[FREID]
I do so in service of our king,

00:21:29.706 --> 00:21:32.208 position:50% align:center
and to honor the God
whom our people worship.

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:33.918 position:50% align:center
Defend this place
while I'm away,

00:21:34.002 --> 00:21:37.005 position:50% align:center
for war will be coming soon.

00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:39.674 position:50% align:center
I'll avenge Cattleya
and do as you command.

00:21:43.887 --> 00:21:46.222 position:50% align:center
You have dared to
thwart the sacred mission

00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:49.309 position:50% align:center
bestowed upon me by God himself.

00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:52.896 position:50% align:center
You shall pay dearly for that,
my unseen enemies.

00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:57.567 position:50% align:center
The moment you see me is
the last time you draw breath!

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.904 position:50% align:center
There is no place in this
world for heathens like you.

00:22:00.987 --> 00:22:03.782 position:50% align:center
Nor for Irregulars!

00:23:42.047 --> 00:23:44.257 position:50% align:center
