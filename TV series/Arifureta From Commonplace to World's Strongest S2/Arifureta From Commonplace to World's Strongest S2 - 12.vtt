[LILIANA] "Eri Nakamura,
who had a common interest

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:50.151 position:50% align:center
with the demons,
orchestrated the invasion

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:52.612 position:50% align:center
of the royal capital.

00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:55.281 position:50% align:center
Using her natural
talent for necromancy,

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:57.409 position:50% align:center
Eri employed the corpse
of the female demon

00:01:57.492 --> 00:01:59.911 position:50% align:center
that she had encountered
in the Great Orcus Labyrinth

00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:02.122 position:50% align:center
to deliver a message.

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:03.164 position:50% align:center
That is how she managed

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:06.126 position:50% align:center
to get in contact
with the demons.

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.003 position:50% align:center
Then, in exchange
for helping the demons

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:10.588 position:50% align:center
access the capital and
murdering both the knighthood

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:13.383 position:50% align:center
and her classmates,
Eri bargained with the demons

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:16.302 position:50% align:center
for her freedom, and that
of Kouki Amanogawa,

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.972 position:50% align:center
one of her classmates.

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:21.349 position:50% align:center
Because her unique magic,
Spirit Binding,

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:23.727 position:50% align:center
only works immediately
after her target's death,

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.646 position:50% align:center
and can therefore only be used
on one victim at a time,

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.067 position:50% align:center
we believe she picked off
her classmates slowly.

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:33.820 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, the invasion
was a failure,

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:37.615 position:50% align:center
but Eri Nakamura escaped
with the demons nevertheless.

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.201 position:50% align:center
We do not believe that Eri
brainwashed or murdered

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:42.662 position:50% align:center
our king herself,
rather that it was the nun

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:45.915 position:50% align:center
from the Divine Mountain,
the kidnapper of Aiko Hatayama,

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.418 position:50% align:center
who perpetrated
these atrocities.

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:51.504 position:50% align:center

is still at large.

I know she was taking
a break, though.

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:42.305 position:50% align:center

I see.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.308 position:50% align:center

Hajime. Kaori will be all right.

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50% align:center
Please go talk to Aiko.

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.021 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.571 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.170 position:50% align:center
You care about your students
more than anything

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.881 position:50% align:center
and I killed some of them.

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:19.175 position:50% align:center
I'm sure that's
weighing on you.

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:22.721 position:50% align:center
To be honest,

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:26.307 position:50% align:center
it's going to take me
a while to get over it.

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:28.143 position:50% align:center
I could never forgive
what Hiyama did,

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:29.936 position:50% align:center
and he didn't
deserve forgiveness.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.480 position:50% align:center
But if he were still alive,
if you hadn't killed him,

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:35.150 position:50% align:center
at least there'd be the
possibility he could atone.

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:37.360 position:50% align:center
And yet, at the same time,
I can understand the rage

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:40.155 position:50% align:center
you must have felt towards him.

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:42.615 position:50% align:center
Anyway, it's useless.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.910 position:50% align:center
I've no right to criticize you,
knowing my part in it.

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:48.038 position:50% align:center
Ms. Aiko, you were
just helping out.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.622 position:50% align:center
Don't be so hard on yourself.

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.666 position:50% align:center
At the end of the day, it was
Tio's breath that killed them.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.668 position:50% align:center
That isn't the point,
and you know it!

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:55.211 position:50% align:center
I helped Tio with
the full knowledge

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:56.755 position:50% align:center
that people could get killed!

00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:58.631 position:50% align:center
But I still did it,
don't you see?

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:02.260 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Are you saying that
you regret that choice?

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:03.553 position:50% align:center
No.

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:04.721 position:50% align:center
In that moment,

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:07.057 position:50% align:center
I felt justified in my choice.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.892 position:50% align:center
I couldn't just sit back
and let the church

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.561 position:50% align:center
continue doing
what it was doing.

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:14.981 position:50% align:center
I wanted to help you.
I had to stop them.

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:18.568 position:50% align:center
I knew if I didn't,
my students would suffer.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:23.948 position:50% align:center
So, no. I've no regrets.
It was worth it.

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:29.871 position:50% align:center
Well, that's good to hear.

00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:31.831 position:50% align:center
So, you'll act like
my teacher again?

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:33.708 position:50% align:center
[AIKO]
Huh?

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:35.543 position:50% align:center
If so, if you still
think you've got

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:38.129 position:50% align:center
what it takes to be
a role model for us,

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:41.966 position:50% align:center
then would you indulge me just
one, very selfish request?

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.719 position:50% align:center
A request? That depends.

00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:46.388 position:50% align:center
I want you to keep
feeling guilty

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:48.181 position:50% align:center
for the harm you've perpetrated.

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:51.851 position:50% align:center
And I want you to keep on
carrying that weight.

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.603 position:50% align:center
Fighting for the right reasons,

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:56.564 position:50% align:center
feeling the burden of violence,
always doing the right thing,

00:05:56.648 --> 00:05:58.775 position:50% align:center
and agonizing over every death.

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.944 position:50% align:center
In essence, knowing who you are.

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:03.738 position:50% align:center
Staying in touch
with your humanity.

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:05.740 position:50% align:center
All those degrees of
empathy are lost to me

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:08.743 position:50% align:center
at this point,
but, as my teacher,

00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:11.371 position:50% align:center
you can show me what
it means to be human.

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:13.581 position:50% align:center
I'll keep my eye on you.

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:16.126 position:50% align:center
That way, when I make it
back to Japan,

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:18.461 position:50% align:center
I can live a proper, human life.

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:23.174 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, Nagumo.

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:27.470 position:50% align:center
That said, if one day
you find that you're in

so much pain you feel like
you're about to break,

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:33.059 position:50% align:center
and it seems like there's
nobody else you can rely on...

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:38.690 position:50% align:center
...you can cry on my shoulder.

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:40.358 position:50% align:center
Thanks for that.

You're much nicer
than you think you are.

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:44.571 position:50% align:center
And if I need to,

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.282 position:50% align:center
I'll take you up on
that sometime, Nagumo.

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:49.993 position:50% align:center

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:58.658 position:50% align:center
What the heck is going on here?

00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:00.368 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Well, to put it simply.

00:11:00.452 --> 00:11:02.871 position:50% align:center
We used magic to
protect Kaori's soul,

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:04.289 position:50% align:center
then we repaired Noint's body

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:07.709 position:50% align:center
and transplanted
Kaori's soul into it.

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:10.503 position:50% align:center
Interesting. I don't get it.

00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:13.882 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Well, um.
Here's the deal.

00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:16.259 position:50% align:center
We learned before that
the magic we normally use

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:18.678 position:50% align:center
is just an inferior copy
of the magic from the era

00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:21.473 position:50% align:center
called the God's Age, right?
You with me so far?

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:23.350 position:50% align:center
Yes, the magic they mention

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:25.894 position:50% align:center
in this world's
creation mythology.

00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:27.812 position:50% align:center
It works on a fundamental level,

00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:31.483 position:50% align:center
unlike the elemental magic
we use in this age.

00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:32.984 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:34.694 position:50% align:center
Are you saying what
I think you are?

00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:37.989 position:50% align:center
That Nagumo can use God's Age
magic to manipulate souls?

00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:39.240 position:50% align:center
Is that right?

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:40.367 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Mm-hm.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:41.618 position:50% align:center
Now I get it.

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.037 position:50% align:center
You used that to protect
Kaori's soul from death

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.997 position:50% align:center
and transfer it to another body.

00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:49.250 position:50% align:center
Yes! I knew you'd
catch on, Shizuku.

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:52.045 position:50% align:center
But, like, why'd you
pick that body?

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:54.214 position:50% align:center
Was her old body
really that far gone?

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:56.966 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Nah, we were able to
restore Kaori's original one,

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.010 position:50% align:center
and we could have put
her soul back in it.

00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:00.512 position:50% align:center
Then why didn't you?

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:02.138 position:50% align:center
[KAORI]
Because I asked them not to.

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:03.348 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:07.310 position:50% align:center
It was my choice and
I wanted to be stronger.

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:11.147 position:50% align:center
You know Kaori. Gets an
idea and won't shut up.

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:13.441 position:50% align:center
As far as her original form,

00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:16.444 position:50% align:center
we stored it in a suspended
state using magic.

00:12:16.528 --> 00:12:20.323 position:50% align:center
She's free to go back
to it whenever she wants.

00:12:20.407 --> 00:12:21.741 position:50% align:center
That all makes sense.

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:24.244 position:50% align:center
Huh. Kaori always did get
the most hairbrained ideas

00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:26.204 position:50% align:center
in that head of hers,
but I gotta say,

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:27.789 position:50% align:center
this one takes the cake.

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:30.917 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Sorry again
for worrying you.

00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:33.628 position:50% align:center
Don't be. You're still
alive, aren't you?

00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:35.255 position:50% align:center
It's all good.

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:42.429 position:50% align:center
So, Nagumo, Yue, Shea,
Tio, I thank you.

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:44.180 position:50% align:center
I am eternally grateful to you.

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:46.808 position:50% align:center
You saved my best friend.

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.977 position:50% align:center
I can never repay this debt.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.147 position:50% align:center
If there is anything I can do,
you just have to ask.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.400 position:50% align:center
I'll do my best to make good.

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:57.902 position:50% align:center
You're as honorable
as ever, aren't ya?

00:12:57.986 --> 00:13:00.280 position:50% align:center
Don't make a big deal
out of it, 'kay?

00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:01.698 position:50% align:center
We didn't do anything crazy.

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:04.617 position:50% align:center
We just saved our
friend, that's all.

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:06.703 position:50% align:center
You say that,
but you did console me

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:08.204 position:50% align:center
when things went south,

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:11.833 position:50% align:center
and you used some of your
precious medicine on our Kouki.

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:15.295 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Meh, if you'd
had a total breakdown,

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:17.714 position:50% align:center
I never would have heard
the end of it from Kaori.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:21.301 position:50% align:center
Um, excuse me, sir?
That's pretty rude, Hajime.

00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:24.929 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] And besides.
According to a certain teacher,

00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:28.058 position:50% align:center
I should be shooting for
a less solitary existence.

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:29.642 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:34.439 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] I can do some things
by myself, but not everything.

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:36.066 position:50% align:center
He listened.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:39.778 position:50% align:center
[KOUKI]
What do you mean?

00:13:39.861 --> 00:13:42.197 position:50% align:center
Are you seriously telling me
we've been nothing but pawns

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.616 position:50% align:center
in some god's game
this entire time?

00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:47.243 position:50% align:center
Why the hell didn't you
tell us about this sooner?

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:49.162 position:50% align:center
And if I <i>had</i> told you sooner,

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:51.414 position:50% align:center
you think you would've
believed me?

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:52.957 position:50% align:center
That god is crazy,

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:56.294 position:50% align:center
and everything you guys are
doing is completely pointless.

00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:59.506 position:50% align:center
You would've gotten pissed
at me, called me a liar,

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:01.257 position:50% align:center
maybe even worse.

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:04.803 position:50% align:center
Maybe, but now we must
fight this god together.

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:06.638 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow your roll.

00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:09.182 position:50% align:center
I never said I was gonna
fight god or anything.

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:10.183 position:50% align:center
For real?

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:11.768 position:50% align:center
Don't you care
at all what happens

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.520 position:50% align:center
to the people of this world?

00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:15.522 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] I'm flattered you think
I have that kind of power,

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:18.149 position:50% align:center
but I'm not gonna risk my life
for people I've never met.

00:14:18.233 --> 00:14:19.484 position:50% align:center
Well, why not?

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:21.528 position:50% align:center
You're stronger than me.
I know that much!

00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:23.446 position:50% align:center
And what's the point
of having power

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.116 position:50% align:center
if you're not gonna use it
to do the right thing?

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:36.334 position:50% align:center
Use power for justice.
Right. This is your problem.

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:38.878 position:50% align:center
It's precisely why you always
end up shitting the bed

00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:40.547 position:50% align:center
just when it matters the most.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.090 position:50% align:center
'Scuse me?

00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:44.801 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] It's not enough to just
do what's within your power.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.386 position:50% align:center
You've gotta want to do
something so badly

00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:48.346 position:50% align:center
that you're willing to
gain the power to do it.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.514 position:50% align:center
But you weren't built that way,

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:51.808 position:50% align:center
you don't have that
kind of resolve.

00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:16.624 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
Hajime.

00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:17.709 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
What is it, Yue?

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:21.087 position:50% align:center
If we stayed,
wouldn't that be better?

00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:23.006 position:50% align:center
They have their
teacher with them.

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:24.257 position:50% align:center
They'll be all right.

00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:25.925 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
That's not what I mean.

00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:30.388 position:50% align:center
If you leave all your friends,
will you be okay?

00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:32.766 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'll have you.

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:35.060 position:50% align:center
Of course you will, always.

00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:38.438 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, everyone!

00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:40.315 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Hey! Mind if we sit with you?

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:42.484 position:50% align:center
Not at all, sit down!

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:45.695 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, miss,

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:48.448 position:50% align:center
is it all right if
I call you big sister?

00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:50.325 position:50% align:center
Uh, "big sister"?

00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:53.578 position:50% align:center
So, uh, Nagumo, where
are you headed to next?

00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:55.330 position:50% align:center
To a Great Labyrinth, right?

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:57.957 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Yeah, in the
great forest to the east.

00:15:58.041 --> 00:16:00.043 position:50% align:center
We happen to know there's
one of them there.

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:01.378 position:50% align:center
In that case,

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:03.380 position:50% align:center
you'll be passing through
the Empire's territory?

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:04.422 position:50% align:center
Oh, Lily.

00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:05.632 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
I guess so.

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:07.634 position:50% align:center
Well, um, would it
be too much trouble

00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:09.052 position:50% align:center
if I tagged along with you?

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:11.304 position:50% align:center
Huh? Tell me why.

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:13.473 position:50% align:center
In the fallout of
the recent invasion,

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.183 position:50% align:center
there are a number
of important matters

00:16:15.266 --> 00:16:17.268 position:50% align:center
we need to discuss
with the Empire.

00:16:17.352 --> 00:16:21.189 position:50% align:center
It's imperative we meet with
them as soon as possible.

00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:24.734 position:50% align:center
I don't mind taking you,
but not into the capital,

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:26.403 position:50% align:center
and I definitely
won't be joining you

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:28.363 position:50% align:center
when you meet
the emperor, either.

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:32.200 position:50% align:center
[giggles] Of course, I wouldn't
dream of asking so much of you.

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:34.744 position:50% align:center
In that case,
we're coming along, too.

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:36.454 position:50% align:center
We can't leave Lily
in the hands of someone

00:16:36.538 --> 00:16:38.832 position:50% align:center
who doesn't care what
happens to this world.

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:41.501 position:50% align:center
So! I'll protect her
along the way myself!

00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:43.962 position:50% align:center
If Nagumo isn't
gonna do anything,

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:46.631 position:50% align:center
then I'll just have
to save this world!

00:16:46.715 --> 00:16:48.633 position:50% align:center
To do that, I need power!

00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:50.927 position:50% align:center
The power of God's Age magic!

00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:54.389 position:50% align:center
If I follow you, then I
can get that magic, right?

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:56.307 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Well, I can
tell you where it is,

00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:57.767 position:50% align:center
but you're gonna have
to get it yourself.

00:16:57.851 --> 00:16:59.227 position:50% align:center
And you? Follow me?

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.688 position:50% align:center
That sounds like
a freaking nightmare.

00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:03.857 position:50% align:center
But think, Nagumo.
Didn't you say that,

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.234 position:50% align:center
in our current state,
if we went to the labyrinth,

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:08.695 position:50% align:center
we would all die
almost immediately?

00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:12.365 position:50% align:center
Huh? Nah, I didn't say that.
I mean, I was pretty useless,

00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:14.242 position:50% align:center
but I was still able
to pull it off, ya know?

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:17.704 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you'll be fine.
You'd ace it, fam.

00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:23.626 position:50% align:center
Not a sure thing though, is it?

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:26.629 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Can I come, too?

00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:28.214 position:50% align:center
I owe you one.

00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:29.758 position:50% align:center
Think of it this way.

00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:32.844 position:50% align:center
If I'm gonna take on all of
the Great Labyrinths myself,

00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:35.889 position:50% align:center
even one God's Age magic would
make a world of difference.

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:38.183 position:50% align:center
Oh, please let me
come along, too, Nagumo.

00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:41.728 position:50% align:center
I wanna get stronger, so I can
try to talk some sense into Eri!

00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:43.521 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I wanna go, too!

00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:44.856 position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:48.360 position:50% align:center
I wanna be able to protect
myself and my friends.

00:17:48.443 --> 00:17:49.861 position:50% align:center
Well, then?

00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:54.407 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:17:57.202 --> 00:17:59.120 position:50% align:center
Eh, fine then, we ride at dawn.

00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:01.164 position:50% align:center

this is gonna work?

wasn't" is a stretch.
