00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:10.385 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Our next order of
business was to explore

00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:12.846 position:50% align:center
the Sunken Ruins of Melusine.

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.764 position:50% align:center
In order to do this,
we had to leave Erisen

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:15.890 position:50% align:center
for a while.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:35.702 position:50% align:center
[KAORI]
Hajime?

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:38.246 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME sighs]

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.458 position:50% align:center
The Sunken Ruins of Melusine.

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:43.501 position:50% align:center
They're s'posed to be
around here somewhere.

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.229 position:50% align:center
Nature looks the same in
this world as it does in ours.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:29.274 position:50% align:center
This is just like ocean
sunsets I've seen in Japan.

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:32.444 position:50% align:center
Feels like another
lifetime, so long ago,

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:34.946 position:50% align:center
but it hasn't even been
six months yet.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.407 position:50% align:center
Probably 'cause our time
here has been so insane.

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:50.378 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
The moon!

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:00.263 position:50% align:center
Hajime?

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:01.765 position:50% align:center
What are you doing right now?

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.433 position:50% align:center
I recognize that thing.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.935 position:50% align:center
Isn't it the proof of
conquest from Gruen?

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:06.936 position:50% align:center
It is.

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:12.942 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
Whoa!

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.903 position:50% align:center
The center is
filling with light!

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:16.237 position:50% align:center
It's so pretty!

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:18.239 position:50% align:center
Sure is! Magical!

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.123 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.042 position:50% align:center
It's quite a lovely spectacle.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.419 position:50% align:center
Not like the tastes of
some other Liberators.

00:03:31.503 --> 00:03:32.837 position:50% align:center
You got that right.

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:34.547 position:50% align:center
Like fantasy come to life.

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:36.800 position:50% align:center
I have to admit,
I'm getting kind of emotional.

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:02.701 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Okay, then, no wonder
I couldn't find the entrance

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:04.452 position:50% align:center
the normal way.

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:05.995 position:50% align:center
Eff me for thinking
I'd just, you know,

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.205 position:50% align:center
stumble upon it.

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:08.915 position:50% align:center
Have I learned nothing
from this world?

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:13.962 position:50% align:center
The current is alarmingly
strong, is it not?

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:17.173 position:50% align:center
[SHEA] I'm still traumatized
from the last bumpy ride!

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.550 position:50% align:center
Is this safe?

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:31.896 position:50% align:center
Uh, it's all good.

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.069 position:50% align:center
Not trying to sound dirty,

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:39.988 position:50% align:center
but someone's
coming from behind.

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.240 position:50% align:center
Huh, its magic is glowing
red and black,

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:44.909 position:50% align:center
which can only mean a monster.

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.828 position:50% align:center
Time to test out my new weapons.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.921 position:50% align:center
Looks like I was able
to increase the power

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:58.173 position:50% align:center
of those torpedoes.

00:04:58.256 --> 00:04:59.799 position:50% align:center
I'd call that a decent upgrade.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:07.599 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
Hajime, look!

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.768 position:50% align:center
Another star-circle thingy!

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.561 position:50% align:center
It's the fifth one we've seen.

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:15.565 position:50% align:center
So that makes five pentagrams in
five different locations so far,

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.400 position:50% align:center
and the pendant still
has some light left in it,

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:18.610 position:50% align:center
as well.

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:23.573 position:50% align:center
Finding this place by magic
alone would've been difficult.

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.200 position:50% align:center
If we didn't notice
the pattern right away,

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:26.701 position:50% align:center
we'd have run out of power.

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:29.204 position:50% align:center
We never could have done it
without Master's magic ship.

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:30.705 position:50% align:center
You can say that again.

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:04.614 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Now this feels like
an actual starting point.

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:07.325 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's more just a regular
cave than a Sunken Ruin,

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:08.702 position:50% align:center
but still.

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:11.204 position:50% align:center
[YUE] I'm glad it's not
entirely underwater.

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:13.748 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Yue.

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.129 position:50% align:center
Yue can handle it.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:28.555 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
What's wrong?

00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:32.142 position:50% align:center
Oh, nothing. I just zoned out.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.643 position:50% align:center
Okay...

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.897 position:50% align:center
What is that up there
on the ceiling?

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.363 position:50% align:center
[SHEA grunting]
What are these things?

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:47.615 position:50% align:center
[grunting continues]

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:57.250 position:50% align:center
Yue.

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.171 position:50% align:center
Um, Hajime.

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.923 position:50% align:center
This is a little bit demeaning.

00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:06.760 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] The water's only
gonna get deeper from here.

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.928 position:50% align:center
What, don't you like
when I hold you?

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:10.096 position:50% align:center
Of course, but...

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:16.102 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Yue, you look
so adorable up there!

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:18.980 position:50% align:center
[TIO chuckles] Yes, you're
sitting in little Myu's

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:20.357 position:50% align:center
favorite spot!

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:24.402 position:50% align:center
Does this mean we can
officially call you Little Yue

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:25.737 position:50% align:center
from now on?

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.072 position:50% align:center
If you wanna die.

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:30.158 position:50% align:center
[KAORI] Gah! Oh, so only I
get threatened? Cool.

seem a little weak?

[KAORI]
What do you mean?

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.212 position:50% align:center
The monsters.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:43.588 position:50% align:center
I thought they'd be stronger,
since this is a Great Labyrinth

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:44.756 position:50% align:center
and all.

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:54.599 position:50% align:center

Um, Hajime, I got burned.

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:24.295 position:50% align:center
Would you be so kind
as to rub some medicine

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:25.839 position:50% align:center
on me, please?

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:27.799 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Are you seriously
doing this right now?

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:29.592 position:50% align:center
Yue and Tio seem
to be handling things,

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:31.845 position:50% align:center
so I thought we had
some free time.

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:34.222 position:50% align:center

respite and strength.

I wanted him to
touch my breasts.

00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:48.862 position:50% align:center
Hajime, it looks like
this jelly melts magic.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.493 position:50% align:center
I was beginning to
wonder why my flames

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:57.829 position:50% align:center
were losing their
strength so quickly.

00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:59.497 position:50% align:center
It would appear my

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:00.915 position:50% align:center

a Great Labyrinth.

I'm getting monster readings

it, it's transparent,

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:53.695 position:50% align:center

I think it's more
like the whole room.
