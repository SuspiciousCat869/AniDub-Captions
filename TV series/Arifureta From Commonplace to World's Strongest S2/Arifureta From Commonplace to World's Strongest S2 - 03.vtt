Grand Gruen Volcano,
conquest complete!

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:18.101 position:50% align:center
It's been fun, but it's done.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:21.771 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME gasps]

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.657 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
Hajime!

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:23.727 position:50% align:center
Updraft!

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:33.737 position:50% align:center
Hajime!

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.988 position:50% align:center
Say something!

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.086 position:50% align:center
You can't.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.971 position:50% align:center
Please, wake up!

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:02.223 position:50% align:center
[TIO]
On your guard, fool! Above you!

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.686 position:50% align:center
I've got it! Tempest Void!

00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:09.230 position:50% align:center
Hallowed Ground!

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.081 position:50% align:center
Hajime, no!

Shea!

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.542 position:50% align:center
Please, remain calm!

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:31.753 position:50% align:center
Without my spell's
protection right now,

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:33.505 position:50% align:center
not even you would survive this!

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:02.325 position:50% align:center
[FREID] Staging the ambush
here was an excellent idea.

00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:16.423 position:50% align:center
You pose too great a risk.

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:18.675 position:50% align:center
I couldn't just ignore you.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.260 position:50% align:center
That man in particular.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.599 position:50% align:center
How could he possibly have
survived a direct hit

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:28.643 position:50% align:center
from Uranus's breath?

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:31.062 position:50% align:center
Tell me who you are.
I demand it.

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:34.107 position:50% align:center
How many Age of Gods
magics have you learned?

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.026 position:50% align:center
First, are you gonna
introduce yourself

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:39.529 position:50% align:center
or should I call you
Uranus's Breath?

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:41.448 position:50% align:center
Typical demon.

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:44.284 position:50% align:center
I guess a lack of manners
is to be expected, though.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:45.368 position:50% align:center
Hajime!

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
Are you okay?

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:58.089 position:50% align:center
[TIO]
I'm glad to see you standing!

00:04:58.173 --> 00:05:00.508 position:50% align:center
I see no need for pleasantries.

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:03.053 position:50% align:center
After all, you're about
to meet your end.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
Come on, man, I was just
making a childish joke.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:08.933 position:50% align:center
I couldn't care any less
what your name is.

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:12.604 position:50% align:center
By the way, how's your
friend's arm situation going?

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:17.776 position:50% align:center
I think the new look
suits, him, personally.

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:24.532 position:50% align:center
You are speaking to Freid Bagwa.

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.785 position:50% align:center
I am God's obedient Apostle.

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:30.455 position:50% align:center
I bring divine punishment
to heathens.

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:33.083 position:50% align:center
God's Apostle, right.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.377 position:50% align:center
Let me venture
a wild guess here.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.920 position:50% align:center
You learned an
Age of Gods magic,

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.089 position:50% align:center
so now you can
call yourself that.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:41.675 position:50% align:center
You are sharper than
you look, heathen.

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:44.594 position:50% align:center
When the powers of the Age
of Gods were vested in me,

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:47.222 position:50% align:center
I heard the voice of my
God speaking to my heart,

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:50.183 position:50% align:center
saying, "You're my Apostle!"

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:51.518 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Cool.

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:53.937 position:50% align:center
[FREID] I made a vow: to
sacrifice all for the Will

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.146 position:50% align:center
of my God.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.107 position:50% align:center
Your existence stands
in the way of that,

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.443 position:50% align:center
a fact which makes you
my sworn, mortal enemy!

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:03.446 position:50% align:center
Therefore, heathen,
I shall now eliminate you!

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.077 position:50% align:center
Here's where I say,
"That's my line."

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.537 position:50% align:center
[FREID]
What does that mean?

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.830 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
You stand in my way.

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:13.957 position:50% align:center
That makes you my sworn,
mortal enemy.

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:17.961 position:50% align:center
And killing all my
enemies is my thing!

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.140 position:50% align:center
What, did you think only dragons
comprised my arsenal?

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:40.483 position:50% align:center
This defense can't be
penetrated as easily as that.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:42.527 position:50% align:center
Now you shall bear witness.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.530 position:50% align:center
I'll show you the Age of
Gods power I've earned!

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.784 position:50% align:center
I seek nothing
but the will of God.

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:52.162 position:50% align:center
I walk heaven and earth, my
hands reaching for nothing

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:55.165 position:50% align:center
but drifting in the ether
beyond dreams and reality.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:57.959 position:50% align:center
I shall create a fissure
in the seamless world.

00:06:58.043 --> 00:07:00.420 position:50% align:center
I rend the boundary and
bring about a corridor

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:01.963 position:50% align:center
into the divine realm!

00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:03.590 position:50% align:center
Cosmic Rift!

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.804 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
Behind you!

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:23.860 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:24.778 position:50% align:center
Hajime!

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:26.237 position:50% align:center
Hold on, Master!

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:34.704 position:50% align:center
[TIO] How could I let myself
become so complacent?

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:41.211 position:50% align:center
[TIO] Master is still
human, after all.

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:44.172 position:50% align:center
He could get hurt, and
one mistake could result

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:45.632 position:50% align:center
in instant death.

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:49.886 position:50% align:center
Then what should I do?

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:52.055 position:50% align:center
What can I hope to achieve here?

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:58.186 position:50% align:center
[KHARGA]
You must survive.

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:01.231 position:50% align:center
But Father, how can I
when we just--?

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:02.816 position:50% align:center
[KHARGA]
Everything's changed.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:06.611 position:50% align:center
Now the dragonborn must
stay hidden from the world.

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:08.905 position:50% align:center
The dragonborn are
now enemies of God.

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:11.950 position:50% align:center
If it becomes known that
any of us survived this,

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:14.035 position:50% align:center
they will surely start
a massive hunt,

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:16.996 position:50% align:center
and they will stop at
nothing, do you hear?

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.456 position:50% align:center
They won't rest
until we're dead.

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:22.752 position:50% align:center
You mean I have to
remain in hiding forever?

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:27.007 position:50% align:center
No. Only until the
right time comes.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.469 position:50% align:center
Remember this:
Without our virtue,

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:33.722 position:50% align:center
we are mere beasts,
nothing more.

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:38.184 position:50% align:center
However, as long as we wield
the sword of reason and virtue,

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.355 position:50% align:center
We are the dragonborn!

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:44.065 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
What is this power?

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:46.276 position:50% align:center
I can't hold my ground, dammit!

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.777 position:50% align:center
I have to act fast.

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:50.780 position:50% align:center
Let's see how it stands up
to my Limit Break!

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:01.458 position:50% align:center
Now, Cross Bit!

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.313 position:50% align:center
What astounding tenacity.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:26.775 position:50% align:center
I'm so close but can't
land the final blow.

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:29.110 position:50% align:center
--I desire...
--[TIO] Not on my watch!

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:39.871 position:50% align:center
No! Th-That's impossible!

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.210 position:50% align:center
A Black Dragon?

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:03.603 position:50% align:center
But... 

00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:06.022 position:50% align:center
I thought all the
dragonborn were wiped out!

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:09.317 position:50% align:center
[TIO] I won't allow you to
hurt my master anymore!

00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:11.069 position:50% align:center
Remember well, young lad!

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:15.824 position:50% align:center
This is what a real dragon's
breath feels like!

00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:29.170 position:50% align:center
[FREID] To encounter a
survivor of the dragonborn

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:31.631 position:50% align:center
in such a place is
almost unimaginable.

00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:35.427 position:50% align:center
You leave me no choice.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.721 position:50% align:center
This is going to be
riskier than I'd like,

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:39.764 position:50% align:center
but I'll use magic
on the entire area.

00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:41.099 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
I don't think so!

00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:57.907 position:50% align:center
[FREID yells]

00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:25.018 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Dammit, time's up.

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:34.819 position:50% align:center
[TIO]
I've got you, Master!

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:36.321 position:50% align:center
Please hold on!

00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:39.199 position:50% align:center
Good catch.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.296 position:50% align:center
[FREID]
Terrifying combat powers.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.550 position:50% align:center
Those women serving him
are extraordinary as well.

00:11:57.634 --> 00:12:00.011 position:50% align:center
A dragonborn,
thought to be extinct,

00:12:00.095 --> 00:12:01.930 position:50% align:center
a magic user who can
cast without chants

00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:03.264 position:50% align:center
or magic circles,

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:05.225 position:50% align:center
and a rabbitman
with inhuman strength

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:08.728 position:50% align:center
and an ability
to see the future.

00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:11.815 position:50% align:center
I never thought it possible that
I could feel this threatened,

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:15.068 position:50% align:center
even with my Age of Gods powers.

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:18.071 position:50% align:center
If I hadn't been lucky enough
to land that first blow,

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:21.533 position:50% align:center
then I might easily have been
the one defeated today.

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:24.786 position:50% align:center
Pretty cocky of you to be acting
as if you've already won.

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.581 position:50% align:center
Make no mistake.
I'm still in this fight.

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:31.584 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you are.

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:34.713 position:50% align:center
Now that I look at you, how
could I begin to doubt it?

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:36.506 position:50% align:center
The torrent of murderous
intent pouring out of you

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.008 position:50% align:center
is still quite strong.

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:43.179 position:50% align:center
Your most terrifying trait
may not be fighting,

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:46.016 position:50% align:center
but your unstoppable
drive to kill.

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:49.269 position:50% align:center
No, it's your insistence
on survival.

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:54.733 position:50% align:center
I had no intention
of using this tactic.

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:57.277 position:50% align:center
But I have to say, it seems
a worthy sacrifice

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.280 position:50% align:center
to kill a powerful foe
such as yourself.

00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:01.865 position:50% align:center
What are you babbling about?

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:04.534 position:50% align:center
[SHEA yelps]

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:12.042 position:50% align:center
Hajime! The lava is rising!

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.008 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
What did you do?

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:24.763 position:50% align:center
I just destroyed the
cornerstone, of course.

00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:26.681 position:50% align:center
The cornerstone, huh?

00:13:26.765 --> 00:13:29.225 position:50% align:center
Didn't you notice anything
odd about this lava?

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:33.355 position:50% align:center
It seems quite clear
the Grand Gruen Volcano

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:34.939 position:50% align:center
is an active one.

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:37.108 position:50% align:center
But interestingly enough,
there are no known records

00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:40.445 position:50% align:center
of it ever having erupted
at any point in the past.

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:42.030 position:50% align:center
Now, why would that be?

00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:47.577 position:50% align:center
Perhaps because there's
something controlling

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.371 position:50% align:center
the magma chamber
underneath, preventing it

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:52.665 position:50% align:center
from spewing forth its wrath.

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:53.792 position:50% align:center
You ass.

00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:11.351 position:50% align:center
The desire to survive
can only get you so far.

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:14.896 position:50% align:center
You will perish here, along
with the Great Labyrinth.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:21.861 position:50% align:center
Hajime?

00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:22.821 position:50% align:center
What now?

00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:23.947 position:50% align:center

Master?

00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:30.578 position:50% align:center
Tio, listen carefully.

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:35.333 position:50% align:center
I want you to take this and
escape through the mouth

00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:37.627 position:50% align:center
of the volcano.

00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:39.963 position:50% align:center
[TIO]
But why, Master?

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:43.049 position:50% align:center
Please. Have I not proved
myself worthy to share

00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:45.385 position:50% align:center
your final moments of life?

00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:47.178 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
That's not it.

00:14:47.262 --> 00:14:48.388 position:50% align:center
We're running out of time here,

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:50.807 position:50% align:center
so I'm only going
to say this once.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.059 position:50% align:center
I'm not calling it quits
on anything at all.

00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:57.480 position:50% align:center
I'll retrieve the
Age of Gods magic.

00:14:57.564 --> 00:15:00.150 position:50% align:center
Then I'll beat that guy
to a pulp one day,

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:02.152 position:50% align:center
and I'll deliver the
Stillstone to Ankaji,

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:04.612 position:50% align:center
just as I promised.

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:07.782 position:50% align:center
But I can't do it all alone,

00:15:07.866 --> 00:15:09.534 position:50% align:center
which is why I'm going
to need your help,

00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:10.994 position:50% align:center
you understand?

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:15.248 position:50% align:center
No one can do it but you.

00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:16.875 position:50% align:center
You're the only one of us
who can punch through

00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.586 position:50% align:center
every obstacle and
return to Ankaji quickly.

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:22.213 position:50% align:center
So fly for us, Tio!

00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:25.175 position:50% align:center
[TIO]
Understood!

00:15:31.348 --> 00:15:32.557 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

A message to Kaori and Myu:

00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:38.521 position:50% align:center

[TIO]
I shall deliver it, Master.

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:16.476 position:50% align:center
[TIO] Ha!
This pain is nothing to me!

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:18.937 position:50% align:center
In fact, it feels incredible!

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.855 position:50% align:center
Give me more!

00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:22.190 position:50% align:center

Pain Conversion.

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:41.126 position:50% align:center
Far from slowing me
down, receiving pain

00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:43.461 position:50% align:center
boosts my stats
across the board.

00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:47.007 position:50% align:center
Of course, it's all
Hajime's fault.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.091 position:50% align:center
What?

00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:51.970 position:50% align:center
Fine, do your worst!

00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:01.104 position:50% align:center
This is amazing!

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:03.565 position:50% align:center
It's so far beyond wonderful!

00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:10.155 position:50% align:center
Oh, how I love you, my master!

00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
The blasted creature actually
managed to escape?

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:14.743 position:50% align:center
What a group of monsters.

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:17.454 position:50% align:center
Still, the black dragon
took a lot of damage.

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:18.705 position:50% align:center
It won't get far.

00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:20.206 position:50% align:center
I'll finish it here--

Master, Yue, Shea, good luck.

00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:44.356 position:50% align:center

in here, little one?

I wonder if you're a noble's
pet or something.

Also a terribly
naughty li'l kitty

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:34.215 position:50% align:center
for running off and leaving
your poor master like that.

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:36.426 position:50% align:center
Shizuku will punish you
for being such a bad,

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:38.553 position:50% align:center
naughty kitty!

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:40.388 position:50% align:center
Hey, Hold on!

00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:42.599 position:50% align:center
Where are you going, meow?

00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:51.191 position:50% align:center
Sorry to interrupt,

00:19:51.274 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
but when I noticed you
weren't with Kouki,

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:56.279 position:50% align:center
I thought you might be training,
so I came to look for you.

00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:57.322 position:50% align:center

[SHIZUKU] So--what did the
church and castle officials say?

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.131 position:50% align:center
Well, they--

00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:17.717 position:50% align:center
they just kept going on and on
about how important it was

00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:21.096 position:50% align:center
for Kouki to get powerful
enough to fight the Demons.

00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:23.139 position:50% align:center
And they said the
sooner the better.

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:25.225 position:50% align:center
What was their take on Nagumo?

00:20:25.308 --> 00:20:27.811 position:50% align:center
It hasn't been fully

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:35.860 position:50% align:center
There's been some talk about

[ERI]
You don't seem very happy.

00:20:56.923 --> 00:20:59.968 position:50% align:center
I guess it's only natural,
especially considering

00:21:00.051 --> 00:21:02.846 position:50% align:center
that your precious little
princess was taken away,

00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:04.889 position:50% align:center
right in front of your eyes.

00:21:04.973 --> 00:21:05.932 position:50% align:center
Go away!

00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:07.350 position:50% align:center
He was alive!

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:10.520 position:50% align:center
So there's no reason for
me to obey you! Okay?

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:12.063 position:50% align:center

Don't you want her?

[ERI] He may have survived,
but that doesn't change

00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:23.283 position:50% align:center
the fact that you tried
to kill him, you know.

Attempted murder,
that's what it's called, right?

of the day,

00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:30.623 position:50% align:center
I'd rather not accuse a
classmate, if I had a choice.

obey me blindly or anything.

Well, then.
Let's wrap this up, shall we?

00:21:51.895 --> 00:21:55.565 position:50% align:center
After that, your wishes
