00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:56.324 position:50% align:center
Hajime, stop.

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:06.042 position:50% align:center
Kaori really does care
about the people here.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.670 position:50% align:center
Helpless in the face
of illness and injury.

00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:10.255 position:50% align:center
Hostage to her tender heart.

00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:12.298 position:50% align:center
I've never met anyone
as kind as her.

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:15.176 position:50% align:center
Big Sister Kaori's
the sweetest ever!

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.557 position:50% align:center
Well, she is a
healer, after all.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.144 position:50% align:center
[SHEA] Aww... I wish I could
use magic like Kaori.

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:26.104 position:50% align:center
That would be so amazing!

00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:30.358 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what is it?

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:36.906 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
Tips on using magic?

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.074 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
Pretty please!

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.701 position:50% align:center
I mean, we know you're
an absolute genius

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:41.202 position:50% align:center
when it comes to that stuff.

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:43.079 position:50% align:center
I'm absolutely terrible at it,

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:44.706 position:50% align:center
but that could change if
I had someone like you

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:46.041 position:50% align:center
to teach me.

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:48.251 position:50% align:center
I'd be thrilled if I could
just do a spell or two.

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:51.171 position:50% align:center
All right, then.

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:52.422 position:50% align:center
I might as well.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.549 position:50% align:center
The stronger our
group is, the better.

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.801 position:50% align:center
No way! You'll really do it?

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.678 position:50% align:center
Aww, you just made
my entire day.

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:00.680 position:50% align:center
Thank you so so much, Yue.

00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:02.223 position:50% align:center
I'm finally gonna get
out there and make

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:03.933 position:50% align:center
my magical debut.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.852 position:50% align:center
Yue giving magic lessons.

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:08.563 position:50% align:center
That sounds like a
fascinating experience.

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:11.232 position:50% align:center
Say, do you suppose
I might join in, as well?

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:13.193 position:50% align:center
And Myu too!

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:14.861 position:50% align:center
It's no trouble.

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:17.906 position:50% align:center
Imagine, me giving lessons
to one of the dragonborn.

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.866 position:50% align:center
It's pretty incredible, really.

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.410 position:50% align:center
Will you be joining us
for instruction, too?

00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:23.953 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna have to pass.

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:25.497 position:50% align:center
It's going to be fun, though.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.457 position:50% align:center
Wait, I think I might
know the problem.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.501 position:50% align:center
Is the all-powerful
Hajime suffering from

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.628 position:50% align:center
a little case of
performance anxiety?

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.254 position:50% align:center
Worried that you can't keep up?

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:34.339 position:50% align:center
Uh, no.

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:35.882 position:50% align:center
Way off the mark with that one.

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:37.258 position:50% align:center
[SHEA] Then stop fiddling
with that thing

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:39.135 position:50% align:center
and come practice magic with us!

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.804 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Yeah, Papa, please?

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:42.138 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Not happening.

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.140 position:50% align:center
And I promise, the rest
of you would be better off

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.809 position:50% align:center
ditching this class, too

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:49.479 position:50% align:center
For your own good, don't do it.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.398 position:50% align:center
Why would you say that, Hajime?

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.733 position:50% align:center
You think I'll do
that bad of a job?

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:54.901 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:56.403 position:50% align:center
You can't be good
at everything, you know.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.488 position:50% align:center
Huh?! Are you nuts?

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.281 position:50% align:center
I can't think of anyone
who could possibly

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:03.326 position:50% align:center
be better suited to
teach magic than Yue.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.370 position:50% align:center
Indeed, I have to agree.

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.288 position:50% align:center
I've lived a long life,
but I've never met one

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:09.666 position:50% align:center
as skilled as she in that area.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:13.545 position:50% align:center
I'm certain Yue will be
an exceptional teacher.

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:15.296 position:50% align:center
Come on, Papa!

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.506 position:50% align:center
You heard them.

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.594 position:50% align:center
Don't say I didn't
warn you guys.

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:22.804 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.266 position:50% align:center
[BIRD caws]

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:29.060 position:50% align:center
Listen up.

00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:30.770 position:50% align:center
It's not too complex.

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:33.398 position:50% align:center
Give the magic a "floom."

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:36.026 position:50% align:center
And behold! You're ready to go.

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:39.237 position:50% align:center
Deep breath, a nice,
big "gop," then "fooey"!

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.905 position:50% align:center
That's all there is to it.

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:46.036 position:50% align:center
See? Super simple.

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.246 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but I
don't see at all.

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:50.415 position:50% align:center
--[YUE] Huh?
--Um, how do you "floom"?

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:52.334 position:50% align:center
And what, precisely,
does "fooey" mean?

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:55.795 position:50% align:center
When the magic
changes from "squeeze"

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:59.215 position:50% align:center
onto the next phase:
"Shoop!"

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.092 position:50% align:center
Which is clearly
quite different.

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:04.721 position:50% align:center
Then it's time for the
final step: "Kawah,"

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:06.514 position:50% align:center
and there you have it.

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:08.808 position:50% align:center
Was that supposed to help?
Because it didn't!

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:10.852 position:50% align:center
If anything, I'm more
lost now than I was

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:12.437 position:50% align:center
a second ago!

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:15.148 position:50% align:center
Please, we're begging of you.

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:18.151 position:50% align:center
Use words that actually resemble
some form of language.

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:19.235 position:50% align:center
Myu!

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:23.615 position:50% align:center
That was nice, but perhaps
you could try giving us

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:26.284 position:50% align:center
a more human explanation
with a bit more detail?

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:30.288 position:50% align:center
In order to achieve
the "fooey" state,

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:32.499 position:50% align:center
the magic acceleration
ratio must be exactly

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:34.626 position:50% align:center
2.25 times the flat state,

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:38.546 position:50% align:center
which can fluctuate
between 2.25 and 2.277

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.340 position:50% align:center
depending on both the
attribute and the element

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:41.716 position:50% align:center
of magic that's in play.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.510 position:50% align:center
By applying resistance
to this at a factor

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:46.096 position:50% align:center
of 3.95, you can almost
automatically achieve

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:48.390 position:50% align:center
the necessary final values
for the focus ratio

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:50.225 position:50% align:center
and the fluctuation
post-liberation.

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:52.769 position:50% align:center
I think I understood
maybe five of those words.

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:56.106 position:50% align:center
[YUE] That's why I started
with a simple explanation,

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:59.401 position:50% align:center
so you could begin
to grasp it naturally.

00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:01.528 position:50% align:center
Why is this so
difficult for you?

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:04.155 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:07.575 position:50% align:center
[TIO grunts]

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:10.495 position:50% align:center
So, have I been fooling
myself all this time?

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:12.288 position:50% align:center
Thinking I was skilled
at magic when in truth

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:15.333 position:50% align:center
I can't even comprehend its
most fundamental aspects.

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:17.585 position:50% align:center
This is beyond humiliating.

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:20.005 position:50% align:center
Big Sister Tio,
are you all right?

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:23.049 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
Yue, please!

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:25.176 position:50% align:center
Tio's pride can't take
much more of this.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.928 position:50% align:center
You just need to practice.

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:28.138 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.515 position:50% align:center
Do as I say, and you'll
grasp it in no time.

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:31.433 position:50% align:center
Now get up.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:32.892 position:50% align:center
Let's try this again.

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:35.395 position:50% align:center
Here we go.

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:37.188 position:50% align:center
Simply repeat after me.

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:38.690 position:50% align:center
Floom-floom. Bar-bar.

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:40.942 position:50% align:center
Bar. Fooey!

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:43.778 position:50% align:center
[GROUP] Those words don't
make sense either!

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:45.280 position:50% align:center
Come on, ladies.

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:46.740 position:50% align:center
Show me what you can do.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:50.285 position:50% align:center
Everybody ready? Set? Go!

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:51.619 position:50% align:center

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:57.292 position:50% align:center
Floom-floomy-floom?

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:59.210 position:50% align:center
Right. Floomy-floom.

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:01.463 position:50% align:center
Floom!

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:03.715 position:50% align:center

Then a nice, big "gop."

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:05.300 position:50% align:center
A nice big "gop."

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:06.634 position:50% align:center
A big "gop"!

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:07.969 position:50% align:center
And now with emotion.

00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:09.179 position:50% align:center

00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:15.393 position:50% align:center
I knew something like this
was gonna happen,

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:16.895 position:50% align:center
but did any of 'em listen to me?

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:18.605 position:50% align:center
No, of course they didn't.

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:22.859 position:50% align:center
Shea, Tio, stand up now.

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:24.027 position:50% align:center
You can do this.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.820 position:50% align:center
Okay, I'm all finished.

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:28.031 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's going on?

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:30.617 position:50% align:center
It has nothing to do with you.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.244 position:50% align:center
We... we were learning
some magic from Yue,

00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:35.080 position:50% align:center
but it's not as
easy as it looks.

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:36.956 position:50% align:center
Oh, how fun.
I want to learn, too.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.375 position:50% align:center
Can I join you?

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:39.459 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
Kaori.

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:40.794 position:50% align:center
You don't want to do that.

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:42.921 position:50% align:center
Just trust me on this one.

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:44.673 position:50% align:center
[KAORI]
But why not?

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:46.508 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
As much as I hate to say it,

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:48.009 position:50% align:center
the truth is...

00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:51.763 position:50% align:center
...Yue might be the worst
teacher in the history of ever!

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:54.724 position:50% align:center
Although, she does excel at
shattering a person's will.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:01.356 position:50% align:center
Kaori, You really want
to learn, ask Tio.

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:02.440 position:50% align:center
Trust me.

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:04.025 position:50% align:center
We'll all be better
off that way.

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:07.821 position:50% align:center

You jerk.

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:12.033 position:50% align:center
What do you say, Teacher?

00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:13.535 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
I'd rather die.

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:15.620 position:50% align:center
[KAORI] Now, that's no way
to treat a potential student.

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:16.955 position:50% align:center
I'm beginning to understand
why the others

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:18.456 position:50% align:center
are so discouraged.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.291 position:50% align:center
The wrong attitude can
have quite a negative

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:22.544 position:50% align:center

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:24.963 position:50% align:center
Why don't we see if you
do better teaching me.

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:26.840 position:50% align:center
So, what'll it be?

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:29.175 position:50% align:center
Your Hallowed Ground
spell, maybe? Yeah?

00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:32.971 position:50% align:center
[YUE] You're just going
to laugh and say it makes

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:34.055 position:50% align:center
no sense.

00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:38.351 position:50% align:center
First, you want
to grab, like so.

00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:40.270 position:50% align:center
Then you give it a
good wiggle, wiggle,

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:42.605 position:50% align:center
and at that point, you
should feel it go "shoop,"

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:44.482 position:50% align:center
bringing you at last to "fooey."

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:47.736 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:49.821 position:50% align:center
First, grab like so.

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:51.072 position:50% align:center
Wiggle, wiggle.

00:08:52.574 --> 00:08:54.242 position:50% align:center
Okay, I can feel the "shoop."

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:56.619 position:50% align:center
Which brings me
at last to "fooey"!

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:02.042 position:50% align:center
What the hell?! How?!

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:06.629 position:50% align:center
Wow! Big Sister Kaori! Amazing!

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:08.048 position:50% align:center
There, did you see that?

00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:10.091 position:50% align:center
You aren't a bad teacher, Yue.

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:12.260 position:50% align:center
I got the hang of
that spell super-fast.

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:14.095 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You really did.

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:15.347 position:50% align:center
Can you do it again?

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.389 position:50% align:center
[KAORI]
Of course!

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:17.724 position:50% align:center
First you grab.

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.017 position:50% align:center
And wiggle, wiggle.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.519 position:50% align:center
Then feel the shoop,
and "fooey"!

00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:25.148 position:50% align:center
Just like that. So easy.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.441 position:50% align:center
So easy!

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:28.234 position:50% align:center

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:29.611 position:50% align:center
Stand up, you two.

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:31.112 position:50% align:center

Repeat after me, everyone.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.912 position:50% align:center
Grab, then wiggle, wiggle,
shoop, and fooey!

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:40.246 position:50% align:center
Come on, you can do it.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.957 position:50% align:center
Grab! Grab! Let me hear you!

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:44.459 position:50% align:center
[KAORI, MYU]
Grab!

00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:46.378 position:50% align:center
[SHEA, TIO]
Ugh, grab.

00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:47.462 position:50% align:center

Louder!

00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:53.802 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Grab! Then wiggle, wiggle.

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:56.096 position:50% align:center
Feel the shoop! And fooey!

00:09:56.179 --> 00:10:00.433 position:50% align:center
And fooey! Fooey! Fooey!

00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:03.520 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Uh, Myu, do you think
maybe we could save that

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.146 position:50% align:center
for another time?

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:09.984 position:50% align:center
Wow, would ya look
at this place?

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:12.362 position:50% align:center
Sure is a lot going
on here, isn't there?

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.614 position:50% align:center
Do all the shops
sell pretty clothes?

00:10:14.698 --> 00:10:16.741 position:50% align:center
I've never seen
anything like it!

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:19.744 position:50% align:center
[TIO] This town specializes
in dyed textiles.

00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:22.205 position:50% align:center
The citizens proudly
display its wares.

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.833 position:50% align:center
Yes. You can tell the
clothing's well-crafted.

And colorful.
It's all so lovely.

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:29.587 position:50% align:center
I'm glad that we
took this detour.

[HAJIME]
Hey, Myu.

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:31.923 position:50% align:center
Myu?

00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:33.258 position:50% align:center
That makes me wonder.

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:35.385 position:50% align:center
Is there some type of
clothing that merfolk

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:36.594 position:50% align:center
consider traditional?

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:38.346 position:50% align:center
We mostly don't wear any!

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.431 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:41.266 position:50% align:center
So you're a bunch
of nudists, then?

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:43.268 position:50% align:center
What was that? Ooh!

00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:45.395 position:50% align:center
So you just let it
all hang out, huh?

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:48.815 position:50% align:center
No clothing? I'm not sure
how well I'd do in Erisen.

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:50.316 position:50% align:center
Then here's an idea.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.068 position:50% align:center
The three of us can live there.

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:53.945 position:50% align:center
Me, Hajime, and Myu.

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:55.488 position:50% align:center
[KAORI]
No! Wait a second!

00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:57.657 position:50% align:center
I can learn to be
a nudist if I have to.

00:10:57.741 --> 00:10:58.908 position:50% align:center
Yep, count me in, too!

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:00.368 position:50% align:center
Where do I sign up?

00:11:00.452 --> 00:11:01.953 position:50% align:center
You're all hopeless.

most, and I'll buy it for you.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.932 position:50% align:center
So, Myu, which one
of 'em is it gonna be?

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center

I dunno. There are so many.

enough to buy your own.

Hajime, that's not
the issue, here.

Yes, what's going on, Myu?

00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:24.090 position:50% align:center
And you too, Shea.
Looks lovely.

00:15:24.174 --> 00:15:26.384 position:50% align:center
Thanks for saying so, Hajime.

00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:28.678 position:50% align:center
Big Sister Tio and
Big Sister Shea,

00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:30.221 position:50% align:center
you two look so cute!

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:34.100 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
What about Kaori?

00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:35.185 position:50% align:center
Where is she?

00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:37.020 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
Right. She's still back there.

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:38.563 position:50% align:center
I'll go drag her out.

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:39.898 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Yue?

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:43.234 position:50% align:center
[KAORI gasps] No!
Shea's outfit is like nothing!

00:15:43.318 --> 00:15:45.362 position:50% align:center
I feel totally naked!

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:46.446 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
We all did it.

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:47.781 position:50% align:center
Don't chicken out!

00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:50.200 position:50% align:center
[KAORI] I can't! I can't!
You can't make me!

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:52.118 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
Come on! Don't be like that!

00:16:04.381 --> 00:16:06.966 position:50% align:center
I'm exposed, nobody look at me!

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.969 position:50% align:center
Especially not you,
Hajime, avert your eyes!

00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:37.414 position:50% align:center
[YUE] A merfolk girl, curled up
just like a little kitten,

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:39.124 position:50% align:center
the cuteness is off the charts.

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:40.208 position:50% align:center
I can't resist.

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:41.334 position:50% align:center
I must pet her.

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:44.421 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
I must be careful!

00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:47.382 position:50% align:center
I shall pet her using my
extreme, gentle petting skills!

00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:49.551 position:50% align:center
If I wake her, it's all over!

00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:52.762 position:50% align:center
[YUE chuckles]

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:54.973 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh! I made a noise!

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:56.725 position:50% align:center
I couldn't hold it!

00:16:58.476 --> 00:17:00.270 position:50% align:center
Her cuteness is almost scary.

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:02.313 position:50% align:center
She's too precious.

00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:06.735 position:50% align:center
Wow, Yue.

00:17:06.818 --> 00:17:08.486 position:50% align:center
I've never seen you
make a face like that.

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:10.905 position:50% align:center
Did you melt?
Cuz you've gone soft.

00:17:10.989 --> 00:17:13.408 position:50% align:center
You almost look like
some kind of pervert.

00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:16.578 position:50% align:center
[YUE] An actual pervert calling
me a dangerous pervert.

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:18.038 position:50% align:center
The shame is unbearable.

00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:20.081 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME chuckles]

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:22.917 position:50% align:center
Priceless. Totally priceless.

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:25.003 position:50% align:center
To the max!

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:28.131 position:50% align:center
[YUE] Hajime's using strange
words from his world again.

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:30.675 position:50% align:center
"To the max"?
What's he talking about?

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:33.845 position:50% align:center
Well, it doesn't matter.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:39.476 position:50% align:center
She did say yesterday that I'm
the coolest big sister, but...

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.561 position:50% align:center
I have one gripe.

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:43.313 position:50% align:center
She won't call me mama.

00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:46.608 position:50% align:center
And why not?

00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:49.361 position:50% align:center
Why not call me mama, Myu?

00:17:49.444 --> 00:17:52.072 position:50% align:center
I suppose, for Myu, her
real mother is her mama,

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:53.239 position:50% align:center
so it makes sense.

00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:55.158 position:50% align:center
I get that, but...

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:57.619 position:50% align:center
And yet,
I also don't get it!

00:17:57.702 --> 00:18:01.247 position:50% align:center
I think it's okay to have
more than one mama!

00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:03.249 position:50% align:center
In fact, having two mamas?

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:05.710 position:50% align:center
Who could ask for a
better deal than that?

00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:07.671 position:50% align:center
Um, hold on, Yue.

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:10.298 position:50% align:center
You can't make mothering
into a two-for-one deal.

00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:13.635 position:50% align:center
I think this is where we
say our piece quietly.

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:16.429 position:50% align:center
And look, you woke up poor Myu.

00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:18.473 position:50% align:center
Wha--? Oh, no.

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:22.852 position:50% align:center
Myu.

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:25.063 position:50% align:center
Um, yes, what is it?

00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:26.523 position:50% align:center
Just forget what I said.

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:29.025 position:50% align:center
"Big Sister Yue"
is quite satisfactory.

00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:30.610 position:50% align:center
Really, you can call me that.

00:18:33.405 --> 00:18:34.781 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
This is unbearable.

00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:37.742 position:50% align:center
This ranks in the top three
worst moments of my life.

00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:40.495 position:50% align:center
I wish the abyss would
swallow me whole.

00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:44.457 position:50% align:center
What would mama do right now?

00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:45.625 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:48.753 position:50% align:center
My mama would want me to say.

00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:51.339 position:50% align:center
Big Sister Yue, I love you lots!

00:18:52.924 --> 00:18:55.635 position:50% align:center
You're so strong and
cool and pretty and nice.

00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:58.930 position:50% align:center
You're awesome!
You're the best!

00:18:59.014 --> 00:19:00.682 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Myu.

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:01.933 position:50% align:center
What is this?

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:04.185 position:50% align:center
This feeling, is it comfort?

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:05.770 position:50% align:center
Like a mother's love?

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:07.313 position:50% align:center
What is happening right now?

00:19:09.524 --> 00:19:12.193 position:50% align:center
My energy is being drained.

00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:14.863 position:50% align:center
If I had a mama just
like Big Sister Yue,

00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:17.365 position:50% align:center
that would be so awesome!

00:19:17.449 --> 00:19:20.618 position:50% align:center
But I already have a
mama, and I love her.

00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:22.537 position:50% align:center
She is my only mama.

00:19:24.581 --> 00:19:25.707 position:50% align:center
Oh, but wait!

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.625 position:50% align:center
I don't have a real sister!

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.715 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
Yes!

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:35.800 position:50% align:center
I do want to be your big sister!

00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:41.222 position:50% align:center
I am your big sister now!

00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:43.183 position:50% align:center
Big Sister Yue!

00:19:43.266 --> 00:19:46.102 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much!

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:49.147 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
Gah! Myu is petting me.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.107 position:50% align:center
What a healing experience!

00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:53.443 position:50% align:center
Big Sister forever!

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:55.695 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Her cuteness melted Yue?

00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:56.905 position:50% align:center
Yes, indeed.

00:19:56.988 --> 00:19:58.782 position:50% align:center
It's terrifying.

00:19:58.865 --> 00:20:01.076 position:50% align:center
[TIO]
Myu's emanating maternal energy?

00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:04.913 position:50% align:center
And her power caused Yue to
regress to an infantile state?

00:20:04.996 --> 00:20:06.581 position:50% align:center
Impossible.

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:08.541 position:50% align:center
"The Phe-mom-enon"
seems to be taking place

00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:10.960 position:50% align:center
right now between Myu and Yue.

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:13.922 position:50% align:center
Master, you mean you've
witnessed something like this?

00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:15.715 position:50% align:center
Let me explain.

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:17.509 position:50% align:center
In Japan, there's
a thing known as

00:20:17.592 --> 00:20:20.178 position:50% align:center
"feeling the Babumi
and going Ogya."

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:21.888 position:50% align:center
Well, that sounds terrifying!

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:23.306 position:50% align:center
I've never heard of it!

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.892 position:50% align:center
Is that what's happening
between Yue and Myu?

00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:29.729 position:50% align:center
To sum it up, Myu is showing
an atypical motherly side,

00:20:29.813 --> 00:20:32.691 position:50% align:center
and all that maternal
energy is making Yue

00:20:32.774 --> 00:20:35.235 position:50% align:center
want to cuddle up
to Myu like her baby!

00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:38.780 position:50% align:center
This is gold.

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:40.824 position:50% align:center
So hilariously priceless!

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:43.910 position:50% align:center
The roles reversed like that?
It's ridiculous!

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:46.162 position:50% align:center
We are witnessing
Master's breakdown.

00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:48.748 position:50% align:center
The man is falling apart
right before our very eyes!

00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:50.250 position:50% align:center
Yes, I see.

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:52.794 position:50% align:center
Hajime's mental state does
seem to be disproportionately

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:55.171 position:50% align:center
affected by anything
related to Yue.

00:20:55.255 --> 00:20:58.174 position:50% align:center
And what happened just now
was pretty extraordinary.

00:20:58.258 --> 00:20:59.551 position:50% align:center
A full reversal.

00:20:59.634 --> 00:21:01.970 position:50% align:center
Yue was in mother mode
and Myu was baby.

00:21:02.053 --> 00:21:04.597 position:50% align:center
Now Myu is the mom
and Yue is baby!

00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:06.016 position:50% align:center
It's crazy!

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:08.351 position:50% align:center
[TIO] And Master's psyche
couldn't hold out against

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:10.979 position:50% align:center
an adorability assault
of such magnitude!

00:21:12.981 --> 00:21:15.775 position:50% align:center
[YUE] I understand the appeal
of being a big sister, too,

00:21:15.859 --> 00:21:18.361 position:50% align:center
but the pull of motherhood
is so powerful!

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:21.114 position:50% align:center
And yet, if I can't
be Myu's mama...

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.869 position:50% align:center
...then perhaps I should
start thinking seriously

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:28.580 position:50% align:center
about having my own baby.

00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:30.582 position:50% align:center
The journey continues.

00:21:30.665 --> 00:21:32.417 position:50% align:center
I can't jump Hajime's bones--

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.961 position:50% align:center
I mean, I can't start my happy
family plan with Hajime

00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:37.297 position:50% align:center
right at this second.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.050 position:50% align:center
I have enough self-control
to understand that much.

00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:42.135 position:50% align:center
At the same time,
I can't keep using Myu

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:44.637 position:50% align:center
as an outlet for my
maternal instincts!

00:21:47.057 --> 00:21:48.058 position:50% align:center
Hajime.

00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:50.560 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Hm?

00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:52.103 position:50% align:center
Go "ogya?"

00:21:52.187 --> 00:21:53.772 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Ogya?!

00:21:53.855 --> 00:21:56.107 position:50% align:center
[GROUP yells]

00:21:56.191 --> 00:21:57.359 position:50% align:center
Hold up!

00:21:57.442 --> 00:21:59.652 position:50% align:center
You cannot be saying you
want me to be the baby!

00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:02.739 position:50% align:center
You should know
that's not how I roll!

00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:04.199 position:50% align:center
[YUE chuckles]

00:22:05.492 --> 00:22:09.621 position:50% align:center
[GROUP yells]

00:22:09.704 --> 00:22:12.499 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Ogya!
