[MYU]
Papa!

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:20.478 position:50% align:center
It's morning! Wake up!

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.528 position:50% align:center
Come on! Wakey!

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:31.239 position:50% align:center
It's morning. Time to get up.

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:33.908 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Hey, Myu. You win.

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:36.536 position:50% align:center
I'll get up now, but you have
to stop slapping me first.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.564 position:50% align:center
G'morning. Hi, Myu.

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:32.902 position:50% align:center
[MYU] Papa, why are you
and Big Sister Yue

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.821 position:50% align:center
always naked in bed together?

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.160 position:50% align:center
You'll understand more
once you grow up,

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:42.078 position:50% align:center
but don't worry
about it right now.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.539 position:50% align:center
I'll understand when I grow up?

00:02:44.622 --> 00:02:45.832 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
Yes, you will.

00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:51.087 position:50% align:center
Papa, do you understand
because this part of you

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.006 position:50% align:center
has grown up?

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.467 position:50% align:center
Because I don't have
one of those.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.802 position:50% align:center
So will I never understand?

00:02:57.886 --> 00:02:58.845 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:01.806 position:50% align:center
Myu, it's not like that,

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.434 position:50% align:center
and it's normal for a little
girl not to have one of those.

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:05.977 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:07.479 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about it.

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.439 position:50% align:center
You won't need to,
for at least ten years.

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:10.940 position:50% align:center
Maybe 20.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:13.318 position:50% align:center
Actually, try not to have
anything to do with those, ever.

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:16.988 position:50% align:center
[REMIA] Good morning!
Breakfast is ready.

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:18.948 position:50% align:center
Myu, everyone pitched
in together to cook

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:21.368 position:50% align:center
a lovely breakfast
for you this morning.

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:24.329 position:50% align:center
And it's a full-course fish
meal, your favorite.

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:26.790 position:50% align:center
So I think both of you should
get up and get dressed!

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.208 position:50% align:center
I have to agree.

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:31.127 position:50% align:center
After all, this isn't good
for Myu's education!

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.754 position:50% align:center
Fine, will you relax?

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.475 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] It's been six days
since we got back from

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:47.977 position:50% align:center
the Sunken Ruins of Melusine.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.605 position:50% align:center
I've clearly stayed too long.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:51.690 position:50% align:center
We should...

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.861 position:50% align:center
Papa, what are we
going to do today?

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:58.196 position:50% align:center
Oh, let's, uh...

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:01.783 position:50% align:center
We need to talk about that.

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:07.247 position:50% align:center
Well, I mean, um...

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.916 position:50% align:center
I think my plan might be to make
some new equipment today,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.126 position:50% align:center
or maybe not.

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.628 position:50% align:center
That's great!
And I can help you do that!

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:15.046 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Oh! Thanks.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.214 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Of course!

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:19.759 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
All right!

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:23.054 position:50% align:center
I think it's a perfect day
for all of us to play tag!

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:25.974 position:50% align:center
[KAORI] Oh, so we're gonna
be chasing after you, huh?

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:28.560 position:50% align:center
[TIO] I see, that sounds
very interesting.

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:29.894 position:50% align:center
You ready, Myu?

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.855 position:50% align:center
Best of luck getting
away from us!

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.481 position:50% align:center
Yes! Ready!

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:35.775 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
Here we go!

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:37.610 position:50% align:center
--Stop right there!
--[MYU laughing]

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.248 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] We really need
to get going soon.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.086 position:50% align:center
What should I tell Myu?

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:03.470 position:50% align:center
Will she cry?

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:05.847 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
Stop!

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.557 position:50% align:center
She'll definitely cry.

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:10.727 position:50% align:center
I do not want your life
to be an empty one.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.730 position:50% align:center
And it will be if you forget how
to care about other people.

00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:20.153 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
This is on you, teach.

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.829 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:30.747 position:50% align:center
Myu?

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.540 position:50% align:center
Come on, where did you go?

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:35.835 position:50% align:center
[SHEA yells]

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:39.589 position:50% align:center
I got it!

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:43.802 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:45.303 position:50% align:center
How did that...

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:46.971 position:50% align:center
Myu, I don't think this
is part of the game

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:48.390 position:50% align:center
we're playing today, okay?

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:49.557 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Sure it is!

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:51.184 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
Myu, this is embarrassing!

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:52.352 position:50% align:center
Please give it back!

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:53.645 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
No way!

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:57.774 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Remia.

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:03.238 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Hajime. Truly.

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:05.073 position:50% align:center
Wait, what for?

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:07.492 position:50% align:center
I don't feel like I've done
anything to deserve your thanks.

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:09.285 position:50% align:center
[REMIA laughs]

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.079 position:50% align:center
You're spending so much
effort thinking about

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:12.872 position:50% align:center
my daughter's happiness.

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:15.625 position:50% align:center
Nothing could mean more
to a mother, so thank you.

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:19.421 position:50% align:center
You could tell?

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:21.756 position:50% align:center
I was kind of trying to hide it.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.508 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's funny,
because I'm pretty sure

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:25.593 position:50% align:center
everyone knows.

00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:27.178 position:50% align:center
And it seems as though
the ladies are thinking

00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:29.848 position:50% align:center
the same way, too.

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:32.642 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad Myu has met
such wonderful people.

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:35.520 position:50% align:center
Hajime?

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.398 position:50% align:center
You've all done
so much for us here.

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.191 position:50% align:center
I can never thank you enough.

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:44.112 position:50% align:center
So please, don't
concern yourself.

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:47.449 position:50% align:center
Do nothing more or less
than what you must.

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:49.159 position:50% align:center
Remia.

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:53.580 position:50% align:center
After meeting you, suddenly it
was like she was growing up.

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:55.915 position:50% align:center
She used to be such a baby,

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:58.877 position:50% align:center
but now she can think
about others beyond herself.

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:06.718 position:50% align:center
She already knows the truth.

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:09.220 position:50% align:center
She knows you can't stay.
That you have to leave.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.765 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
Myu, stop!

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:15.393 position:50% align:center
However, she is
still very young,

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:18.396 position:50% align:center
so the baby-ways do pop up.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.941 position:50% align:center
But she hasn't ever said "don't
go" or anything, has she?

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:25.737 position:50% align:center
Please, don't worry.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.364 position:50% align:center
She understands that she
can't possibly keep you here

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:28.490 position:50% align:center
any longer.

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:31.868 position:50% align:center
Though she doesn't
like it, she's fine.

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.745 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Heh.

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:36.331 position:50% align:center
No kid should have to
concern themselves over me.

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:39.501 position:50% align:center
That said,

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:42.087 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna tell her that
we'll be leaving tomorrow,

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.838 position:50% align:center
and I'll try to be
as clear as I can.

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:51.638 position:50% align:center
In that case, we'll prepare
a feast for tonight.

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:55.850 position:50% align:center
It'll be a farewell party
for you before you go.

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:57.519 position:50% align:center
Sounds like fun.

00:07:57.602 --> 00:08:00.522 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'll make sure
it's a nice affair.

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.899 position:50% align:center
Sweet, darling boy.

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:04.359 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:06.444 position:50% align:center
Prob'ly best if you
don't call me that.

00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:10.573 position:50% align:center
Bold move, Remia.

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:12.659 position:50% align:center
So it's like that, is it?

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:14.327 position:50% align:center
I can't let my guard down.

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:16.454 position:50% align:center
You know, depending
on the angle,

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:18.498 position:50% align:center
it looks a bit like she's
performing a certain act

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.709 position:50% align:center
I won't mention in front of Myu.

00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:22.377 position:50% align:center
At least not in public!

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.087 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'll try--

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.964 position:50% align:center
Thank you, sir!

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:29.300 position:50% align:center
[SHEA]
Um, Myu?

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.219 position:50% align:center
Do you think I could get
my bathing suit back now

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:33.013 position:50% align:center
so I can stop doing this?

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:34.431 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Are you sure?

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.354 position:50% align:center
Yue.

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:44.149 position:50% align:center
Kaori?

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:46.526 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:48.653 position:50% align:center
You can have it, Papa!

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:50.947 position:50% align:center
Wait, Myu, did Papa ask
you to steal my top

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:52.949 position:50% align:center
especially for him?

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:56.745 position:50% align:center
Oh, gosh, Hajime.
All you had to do was ask!

00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:59.205 position:50% align:center
Actually, you can
have mine, too.

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:00.707 position:50% align:center
You can feel free
to take mine, too,

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:01.875 position:50% align:center
if you'd like to have it!

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.377 position:50% align:center
Oh, in that case, have mine too.

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:06.546 position:50% align:center
Maybe the top? Or the bottom?

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:08.131 position:50% align:center
Ooh, perhaps both?

00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:11.009 position:50% align:center
[KAORI]
Remia, that's not fair!

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:13.845 position:50% align:center
[chattering]

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.777 position:50% align:center
[MYU sniffling]

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.988 position:50% align:center
We can't see each other anymore?

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:32.989 position:50% align:center
Myu.

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:40.205 position:50% align:center
[MYU] Papa, will you always be
my Papa, even if we're apart?

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:42.457 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course,
if that's what you want.

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:57.305 position:50% align:center
Then I'll just say
have a safe trip.

00:09:57.389 --> 00:10:00.809 position:50% align:center
And one day, later on,
I'll come pick you up!

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:03.061 position:50% align:center
Pick me up?

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:07.148 position:50% align:center
Listen, I have to go someplace
very far away from here.

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:09.776 position:50% align:center
[MYU] But if you can go,
Papa, I can go too.

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:11.027 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:12.779 position:50% align:center
After all, I'm your kid.

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:14.072 position:50% align:center
I can do it.

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:30.005 position:50% align:center
All right, you wait for me.

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:31.297 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Papa?

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:32.924 position:50% align:center
Once everything's over,
I'll come back here

00:10:33.008 --> 00:10:35.760 position:50% align:center
and I'll make sure
to find you, 'kay?

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:38.096 position:50% align:center
I'll bring folks.
You should meet them.

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:39.848 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:41.266 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
I really do.

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:43.560 position:50% align:center
And anyway,
have I ever lied to you?

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:48.857 position:50% align:center
When I come back here,
I'll take you along with me.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.400 position:50% align:center
Show you my hometown,

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.652 position:50% align:center
and then you'll get
to see where I grew up.

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:54.696 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Really? I get to see it?

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:56.781 position:50% align:center
Don't get too excited.

00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:59.909 position:50% align:center
My hometown's not much bigger
than a jack-in-the-box toy.

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:01.327 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
I wanna see it!

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:02.328 position:50% align:center
So, are you excited?

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Yeah, very!

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:07.625 position:50% align:center
Well, then, be good,
and wait with your mom.

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:09.502 position:50% align:center
And be careful.

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:11.379 position:50% align:center
Don't do anything too dangerous.

00:11:11.463 --> 00:11:13.048 position:50% align:center
And listen to your mom, okay?

00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:14.257 position:50% align:center
I will!

00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:22.599 position:50% align:center
Papa. My Mama! Can she come too?

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:24.434 position:50% align:center
Well, we'll see.

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:25.685 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:27.479 position:50% align:center
Come on, you wouldn't
actually leave me out,

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:28.938 position:50% align:center
would you?

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:32.776 position:50% align:center
Uh, I guess not, but it's a
radically different world.

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:34.110 position:50% align:center
Who cares?

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:35.945 position:50% align:center
Why would I not follow my
daughter and my husband

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.405 position:50% align:center
wherever they may go?

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:45.955 position:50% align:center
Now Myu, I could use a little
help preparing for dinner.

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:47.248 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Yes, Mama!

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:57.425 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
You'll take her with you?

00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:59.928 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Should I not?

00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:03.014 position:50% align:center
[YUE] If that's what you've
decided, who am I to say?

00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:04.557 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
I see.

00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:07.185 position:50% align:center
[SHEA] It's not what I expected
you to do, though!

00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:09.396 position:50% align:center
[KAORI] Yeah. I thought,
given how you are now,

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:11.272 position:50% align:center
you'd say goodbye
and leave it at that.

00:12:12.816 --> 00:12:16.486 position:50% align:center
Wow, did meeting Myu turn you
into a bit of a softie, Master?

00:12:19.114 --> 00:12:22.450 position:50% align:center
[YUE] But can you just
decide when to return?

00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:24.494 position:50% align:center
Even if you found
a way to go home,

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:26.371 position:50% align:center
it might not be a method
that you can just use

00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:29.332 position:50% align:center
whenever you want to.

00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:31.459 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
I'll do whatever it takes.

00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:34.170 position:50% align:center
I'll come back here
for Myu no matter what,

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:36.506 position:50% align:center
and I will show her Japan.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:39.259 position:50% align:center
And if it happens that
I cross over without her,

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:40.552 position:50% align:center
I'll have no choice.

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:42.220 position:50% align:center
I'll stop at nothing
to come back.

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:46.683 position:50% align:center
We'll find a way to cross
worlds whenever we need.

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:48.393 position:50% align:center
We'll make it work, ya know?

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:54.315 position:50% align:center
That's exactly right.

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:58.194 position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:01.031 position:50% align:center
Ooh, being ignored like
this really gets me going!

00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:03.116 position:50% align:center
Papa!

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.745 position:50% align:center
Dinner is ready now!

00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:09.039 position:50% align:center
All right, let's go eat, then!

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:10.623 position:50% align:center
--[MYU] Yeah!
--[HAJIME] Yeah!

00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:11.791 position:50% align:center
[MYU laughs]

00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:23.386 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
A good luck charm?

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.889 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
Yes, Papa, that's right!

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:26.931 position:50% align:center
Pretty.

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:28.475 position:50% align:center
That's so sweet, Myu.

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:31.394 position:50% align:center
Sure is!
What a beautiful present!

00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:32.854 position:50% align:center
I'll treasure mine.

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:34.939 position:50% align:center
I got you all the same ones!

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.987 position:50% align:center
We love them. Thanks.

00:13:41.071 --> 00:13:42.822 position:50% align:center
Well, time to go.

00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:49.120 position:50% align:center
Have a safe trip!

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:08.348 position:50% align:center
And you have a safe trip,
too, okay, big sisters?

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:09.974 position:50% align:center
We'll see you soon, 'kay?

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:11.101 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Myu.

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:12.769 position:50% align:center
We'll all be back
before you know it!

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:15.355 position:50% align:center
And you have to promise us
you'll be good until then.

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:16.731 position:50% align:center
[MYU]
I promise!

00:14:18.733 --> 00:14:20.735 position:50% align:center
You'll be careful out there?

00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:21.820 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:04.696 position:50% align:center
[LILIANA]
What was that about?

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:06.239 position:50% align:center
And not only that. 

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:08.616 position:50% align:center
Father has been acting
strangely of late, too.

00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:13.747 position:50% align:center
Feels like there's nobody
here I can trust or rely on.

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:19.669 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
That's it.

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:22.714 position:50% align:center
The preparations
are finally complete.

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:24.924 position:50% align:center
This is such a thrill!

00:15:25.008 --> 00:15:28.511 position:50% align:center
The moment I've been
waiting for has finally arrived!

00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:36.478 position:50% align:center
[AIKO] What are you trying
to do to my students?

00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:38.396 position:50% align:center
Why are you locking
me up like this?

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.567 position:50% align:center
Wait! Please don't
leave me here!

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.695 position:50% align:center
[NOINT] Everything shall
be as he wills it.

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:47.655 position:50% align:center
Now that you're no
longer on the board,

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:49.866 position:50% align:center
there's no need for you to know.

00:16:03.046 --> 00:16:04.464 position:50% align:center
[AIKO]
Oh, Nagumo.

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:11.262 position:50% align:center
Come here if you
dare, Irregular,

00:16:11.346 --> 00:16:14.265 position:50% align:center
but know this:
it will be the end of you.

00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:18.269 position:50% align:center
[FREID]
The oracle has spoken.

00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:20.980 position:50% align:center
The Demon Lord, the very
voice of our god himself,

00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:23.149 position:50% align:center
has issued his holy decree.

00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:25.318 position:50% align:center
We shall destroy the infidels!

00:16:25.402 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
[CROWD yelling[

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:37.414 position:50% align:center
We shall deliver his
Divine Will to them!

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:39.833 position:50% align:center
May they feel our strength!

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:41.292 position:50% align:center
May those fools who
think they control

00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:43.420 position:50% align:center
the northern continent
learn their place.

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:45.672 position:50% align:center
Let us make sure
they never forget!

00:16:59.728 --> 00:17:01.604 position:50% align:center
[MELD] This phenomenon that's
been spreading through

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:02.981 position:50% align:center
the castle,

00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:05.233 position:50% align:center
the void that's infecting our
troops with weakness

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:07.944 position:50% align:center
and lethargy.
What could be the cause?

00:17:08.028 --> 00:17:09.029 position:50% align:center
[JOSE]
Commander.

00:17:10.447 --> 00:17:11.948 position:50% align:center
[MELD]
Is everything in order, Jose?

00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:13.992 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir, and nobody
saw, either.

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:17.370 position:50% align:center
[MELD]
How is the army?

00:17:17.454 --> 00:17:19.289 position:50% align:center
Many are showing symptoms,

00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:20.915 position:50% align:center
including the leader
and officers.

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:23.585 position:50% align:center
It appears to be the void.

00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:26.755 position:50% align:center
Thirty percent of the
armed forces of Heiligh.

00:17:26.838 --> 00:17:27.839 position:50% align:center
[JOSE]
Is it true?

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:30.300 position:50% align:center
That it's some new
form of attack?

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:31.801 position:50% align:center
Couldn't they just
be losing focus?

00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:33.803 position:50% align:center
[MELD]
That's wishful thinking!

00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:36.681 position:50% align:center
Jose, it could get you as well.

00:17:36.765 --> 00:17:39.517 position:50% align:center
[JOSE]
Yes. My apologies.

00:17:39.601 --> 00:17:41.436 position:50% align:center
What about you, commander?

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:43.605 position:50% align:center
And the King, how is he?

00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:46.608 position:50% align:center
[MELD] He is currently not
showing any signs of the void.

00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:49.861 position:50% align:center
In fact, he seems more
energized than ever.

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:51.529 position:50% align:center
In the name of God,
he will punish

00:17:51.613 --> 00:17:53.573 position:50% align:center
the barbarism of the Demons.

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:54.949 position:50% align:center
I don't doubt that.

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:57.786 position:50% align:center
And yet...

00:17:57.869 --> 00:17:59.871 position:50% align:center
[JOSE]
Commander?

00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:03.083 position:50% align:center
Jose, gather all those
who possess knowledge

00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:04.584 position:50% align:center
of Dark Magic.

00:18:04.668 --> 00:18:07.045 position:50% align:center
Have them investigate
the true nature of the void

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:08.588 position:50% align:center
and prepare countermeasures.

00:18:08.672 --> 00:18:09.798 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:18:09.881 --> 00:18:11.758 position:50% align:center
As for Kouki and the others?

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:13.802 position:50% align:center
I will speak with them.

00:18:13.885 --> 00:18:16.638 position:50% align:center
Right now, they're
a bit too unstable.

00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:20.517 position:50% align:center
I don't want to agitate
them if I can avoid it.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.519 position:50% align:center
Though it is inevitable.

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:37.033 position:50% align:center
[MELD]
Magic that only affects morale.

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:39.536 position:50% align:center
The natural assumption,
of course, is that the demons

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:40.912 position:50% align:center
are behind this.

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:43.456 position:50% align:center
But a direct attack
on the royal palace?

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:44.499 position:50% align:center
Impossible.

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:46.334 position:50% align:center
Even if such a thing
were possible,

00:18:46.418 --> 00:18:49.337 position:50% align:center
why not use a more
powerful magic?

00:18:49.421 --> 00:18:52.132 position:50% align:center
If they could use magic
without being detected,

00:18:52.215 --> 00:18:54.551 position:50% align:center
why wouldn't they go after me?

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:56.386 position:50% align:center
Killing the Knight
Commander would surely

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:59.639 position:50% align:center
damage morale more than
some strange, new magic.

00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:03.935 position:50% align:center
Who knows?

00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:06.438 position:50% align:center
I can't help but
analyze their strategy.

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:11.526 position:50% align:center
Please, God.

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:13.737 position:50% align:center
If anything were
to happen to me,

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:17.449 position:50% align:center
I beg you, may this letter
reach Duke Zengen,

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:19.993 position:50% align:center
and especially Hajime Nagumo.

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:21.453 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:25.623 position:50% align:center
Who's there?

00:19:25.707 --> 00:19:27.917 position:50% align:center
[HIYAMA]
Um, Commander Meld?

00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:30.503 position:50% align:center
It's me, Hiyama.

00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:32.172 position:50% align:center
Daisuke?

00:19:32.255 --> 00:19:34.382 position:50% align:center
What could you want
at this hour?

00:19:34.466 --> 00:19:35.633 position:50% align:center
[HIYAMA]
Well, sir.

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:37.927 position:50% align:center
There's something really
important that I need

00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:39.888 position:50% align:center
to discuss with you immediately.

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:45.810 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

I know this might
be out of line,

00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:51.858 position:50% align:center
but my classmates, they
can't hear what I tell you.

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:53.276 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.112 position:50% align:center
No, you coming here's not
out of line in the least.

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:58.073 position:50% align:center
Go ahead, son, what is it?

00:20:09.668 --> 00:20:12.462 position:50% align:center
Don't be afraid, just tell
me what's on your mind.

00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:15.715 position:50% align:center
Whatever it might be,
it can't be all that bad.

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:17.676 position:50% align:center
You and I can
work it out together.

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:25.475 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:27.185 position:50% align:center
Who is it?

00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:29.104 position:50% align:center
[JOSE]
Commander, it's me.

00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:30.605 position:50% align:center
Jose?

00:20:30.689 --> 00:20:33.775 position:50% align:center
[JOSE] There's an urgent report
I have to deliver at once.

00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:38.363 position:50% align:center
It's all right, Commander
Meld, let him in.

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:40.281 position:50% align:center
I'll wait outside until
you're done and figure out

00:20:40.365 --> 00:20:42.075 position:50% align:center
how to say what I came to say.

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:44.953 position:50% align:center
[MELD]
All right. Thank you, Daisuke.

00:20:45.036 --> 00:20:46.121 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:20:59.843 --> 00:21:00.885 position:50% align:center
[MELD]
Jose!

00:21:05.223 --> 00:21:06.266 position:50% align:center
[MELD]
What's going on?

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:15.108 position:50% align:center
No.
Has he been brainwashed?

00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:17.360 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for what
I must do, Jose!

00:21:42.052 --> 00:21:44.012 position:50% align:center
What is this power?

00:21:44.095 --> 00:21:46.681 position:50% align:center
Daisuke, run!

00:21:46.765 --> 00:21:48.767 position:50% align:center
I don't want to kill
you, Lieutenant!

00:21:50.769 --> 00:21:53.271 position:50% align:center
All winds! Howl with
the force of--[grunts]
