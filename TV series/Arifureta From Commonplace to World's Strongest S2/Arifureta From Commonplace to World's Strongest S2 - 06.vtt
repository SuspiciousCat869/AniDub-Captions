[HAJIME]
Let's get something straight.

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.388 position:50% align:center
The only reason I agreed to
let you tag along with me

00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:16.141 position:50% align:center
is because you felt it was
in your own best interest.

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:18.435 position:50% align:center
Just like what
happened with Shea.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:22.647 position:50% align:center
You knew I had feelings for Yue,
but you still wanted in.

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:24.858 position:50% align:center
At that point, I figured, fine.

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:26.943 position:50% align:center
You can make your own decisions.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.112 position:50% align:center
You're a big girl, right?

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.573 position:50% align:center
But now you don't seem too
happy to be in that position.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:36.745 position:50% align:center
So maybe it's time
for a reevaluation.

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:38.163 position:50% align:center
Why did you come along?

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:40.206 position:50% align:center
And should you
really stick around?

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:42.625 position:50% align:center
Kick and scream all you want,

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:45.420 position:50% align:center
I'll take you back to Yaegashi
myself if it comes down to it.

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:49.132 position:50% align:center
I just...

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:32.068 position:50% align:center
I gotta admit,
building such a huge ship

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.987 position:50% align:center
out of nothing but
wood is impressive.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.635 position:50% align:center
This again.

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.554 position:50% align:center
Kaori, you know what this means.

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:02.349 position:50% align:center
Get ready for another
weird game.

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:04.142 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I can handle it.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.781 position:50% align:center
[DEMON A chuckles]
Yes.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.282 position:50% align:center
[DEMON B]
It's delicious.

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:20.992 position:50% align:center
[DEMON C]
Indeed.

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:22.952 position:50% align:center
A party, looks like.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:26.039 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and not just a human one.

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:28.708 position:50% align:center
There are demons and
beastmen here too.

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:30.293 position:50% align:center
Pretty ritzy, if you ask me.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.342 position:50% align:center
Everyone!

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:39.010 position:50% align:center
Thank you for coming.

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:40.970 position:50% align:center
All of you here have
prayed for peace

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:43.098 position:50% align:center
and risked your lives
in the fires of war

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:44.599 position:50% align:center
to achieve it.

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:46.976 position:50% align:center
I am truly delighted to
have gathered you aboard

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.395 position:50% align:center
this ship today.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:51.314 position:50% align:center
I didn't think I'd live to
see the end of this war,

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:52.649 position:50% align:center
and yet here we are.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.859 position:50% align:center
Not only were we able
to stop the fighting,

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:57.237 position:50% align:center
but we did so with
a peace treaty!

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.489 position:50% align:center
And now, but a
single year later,

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.950 position:50% align:center
the view before me
has become a reality.

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:04.494 position:50% align:center
I can't help but feel
overcome with emotion...

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:05.829 position:50% align:center
[KAORI]
They're celebrating.

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.330 position:50% align:center
The end of a war, then.

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:08.748 position:50% align:center
I'd say, given the context,

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:11.459 position:50% align:center
that's the only
real explanation.

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:14.462 position:50% align:center
Maybe we assumed wrong
about this labyrinth's concept.

00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:17.465 position:50% align:center
I certainly like this
vision more than the last.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.010 position:50% align:center
They clearly put in the work
to get where they are now.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.761 position:50% align:center
Overcoming prejudice is no joke.

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.223 position:50% align:center
Don't get me wrong,
I doubt they've gotten over

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:27.183 position:50% align:center
every single grudge,

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.310 position:50% align:center
but they're havin' a good
time together, at least.

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:32.272 position:50% align:center
As today is the
anniversary of said treaty,

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:34.607 position:50% align:center
I've been reflecting
on the past year.

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:38.570 position:50% align:center
And how foolish this has been.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.449 position:50% align:center
It's simply preposterous.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.993 position:50% align:center
Exchanging a toast
with filthy animals.

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:47.120 position:50% align:center
Discussing our future
with heathens.

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:49.330 position:50% align:center
It's the pinnacle of absurdity.

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:53.168 position:50% align:center
Do you still not understand?

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:56.046 position:50% align:center
Yes. I'm talking about you!

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.923 position:50% align:center
What are you saying?
Is this some sick joke?

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.633 position:50% align:center
It's not funny--[grunts]

Panic won't help.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.142 position:50% align:center
As I said moments ago,

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:11.186 position:50% align:center
I'm truly delighted to have
gathered you aboard

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:12.771 position:50% align:center
this ship today.

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:17.567 position:50% align:center
Your foul blood has
been forsaken by God,

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.527 position:50% align:center
and yet you're so arrogant.

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:22.447 position:50% align:center
Pretending you've created
nations and are on

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.075 position:50% align:center
equal footing with us humans.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:29.037 position:50% align:center
You've turned your backs on
Ehit, our one true creator,

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.790 position:50% align:center
to worship some worthless,
pagan god.

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:34.876 position:50% align:center
We'll no longer tolerate
you heretical idiots!

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:36.795 position:50% align:center
As of this very moment,

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:38.505 position:50% align:center
there shall be no peace
for this world

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:40.924 position:50% align:center
without your total annihilation!

[ALEISTER]
Luckily, that won't take long.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.809 position:50% align:center
I'll slaughter the leaders
of every nation today

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:53.895 position:50% align:center
and begin to cleanse
the universe of your kind!

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:57.148 position:50% align:center
Now, faithful servants of Ehit,

00:05:57.232 --> 00:06:00.819 position:50% align:center
unleash upon them
the judgment of God!

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:32.767 position:50% align:center
All right, you need a break.

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:35.103 position:50% align:center
No, it's okay, I'm fine.

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:36.771 position:50% align:center
That was just hard to watch.

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:39.065 position:50% align:center
Anyway, why did it just end?

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:41.109 position:50% align:center
We didn't even do
anything this time.

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:42.819 position:50% align:center
The old guy went inside.

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.612 position:50% align:center
Since that's the last
thing that happened,

00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:46.656 position:50% align:center
maybe we're supposed to
poke around in there too.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:51.244 position:50% align:center
I get the feeling that was
basically just a history lesson.

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:52.662 position:50% align:center
To show us the kind
of screwed up shit

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:55.081 position:50% align:center
that can happen when
you blindly follow Ehit,

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:57.625 position:50% align:center
and a heavy-handed
hint to search the ship.

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:02.213 position:50% align:center

put someone through,

[KAORI]
So, do I have this right?

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:17.312 position:50% align:center
In that last vision, the war
had been over for a year,

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:19.230 position:50% align:center
but that old man
betrayed everyone.

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:21.232 position:50% align:center
Sure seemed like it,
but there's still

00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:23.318 position:50% align:center
one part that doesn't
make sense to me.

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:26.529 position:50% align:center
When he went up on that stage,

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:28.323 position:50% align:center
everyone looked
at him with respect,

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:30.867 position:50% align:center
like he was someone
they'd grown to love.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.619 position:50% align:center
If he'd been harboring
such deep hatred

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:35.538 position:50% align:center
for beastmen and demons,
it's hard to believe

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:37.791 position:50% align:center
he'd have gained that
much admiration from them.

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:39.542 position:50% align:center
Good point.

The way he spoke, it sounded
like something happened.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:45.173 position:50% align:center
Something changed his mind
in the year since the war.

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:47.425 position:50% align:center
It's just such a 180, though.

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:57.198 position:50% align:center
Hey! What are you, insane?

00:10:57.282 --> 00:10:59.576 position:50% align:center
Don't you care about
this woman at all?

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.202 position:50% align:center
Even if I did stop shooting you,

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:04.205 position:50% align:center
I know you're not gonna
give Kaori her body back.

00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:05.999 position:50% align:center
Besides, you said it yourself:

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:09.669 position:50% align:center
If I don't destroy you,
Kaori's soul is fine, isn't it?

00:11:09.753 --> 00:11:12.130 position:50% align:center
Then I gotta make you
wanna leave her body.

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:13.548 position:50% align:center
I'll just torture you
while being careful

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:14.841 position:50% align:center
not to kill you.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.263 position:50% align:center
You threatened someone
who's important to me.

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:22.724 position:50% align:center
So don't expect
a painless death.

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:26.353 position:50% align:center
I'll do everything in my
power to keep you alive.

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:27.979 position:50% align:center
[KAORI]
What's wrong with you?

00:11:28.063 --> 00:11:30.190 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] I'll show you pain
worse than you can imagine,

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:32.609 position:50% align:center
and I'll make sure you're
conscious for it all.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:35.320 position:50% align:center
You may be my enemy...

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.530 position:50% align:center
...but I won't ever kill you.

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:02.180 position:50% align:center
[KAORI]
Don't worry.

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:04.140 position:50% align:center
I'll send you off properly.

00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:20.490 position:50% align:center
I guess it got scared.

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:22.909 position:50% align:center
Looks like that thing's
completely gone.

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:39.592 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:41.261 position:50% align:center
Giving my answer.

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:42.470 position:50% align:center
Answer?

00:12:42.554 --> 00:12:45.598 position:50% align:center
Yes, to your question
from earlier.

00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:48.643 position:50% align:center
Of why I came along with
you and whether I should

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:50.687 position:50% align:center
really be staying
right by your side.

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:54.649 position:50% align:center
I love you, okay, Hajime?

00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:56.317 position:50% align:center
I'm serious.

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:59.529 position:50% align:center
That's all the reason
I need to be near you.

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.906 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Isn't that just
gonna torment you?

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.700 position:50% align:center
You're not Shea,
you don't want to share me

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.493 position:50% align:center
with Yue.

00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:07.162 position:50% align:center
[KAORI]
You're not wrong.

00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:09.914 position:50% align:center
I do want to have
you all for myself.

00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:12.667 position:50% align:center
I want to be your one and only.

00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:16.504 position:50% align:center
I'm sure I'll be jealous of
Yue and feel less than her.

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:18.298 position:50% align:center
Exactly.

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:20.592 position:50% align:center
I know it'll be painful
for me sometimes.

00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:21.676 position:50% align:center
Then don't do it.

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:28.850 position:50% align:center
But I also know, if I backed
off now, I'd regret it.

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:30.977 position:50% align:center
So, I'm not going to.

00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:33.188 position:50% align:center
I know what's best
for me, got it?

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:36.524 position:50% align:center
And right now,
that's being next to you.

00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:38.651 position:50% align:center
If that's really what you want,

00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:41.363 position:50% align:center
then I have nothing
more to say about it.

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:42.405 position:50% align:center
Deal.

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:54.584 position:50% align:center
Hey Hajime, could you
maybe repeat that thing

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:55.960 position:50% align:center
you said earlier?

00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:56.961 position:50% align:center
What thing?

00:13:57.045 --> 00:13:58.213 position:50% align:center
You know!

00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:00.215 position:50% align:center
Who did they threaten
to make you so angry?

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:03.593 position:50% align:center
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:05.345 position:50% align:center
[KAORI]
Come on, don't be like that!

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:06.554 position:50% align:center
Just say it!

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.734 position:50% align:center
The hell?

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:23.238 position:50% align:center
Is that a magic circle?

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:25.532 position:50% align:center
Are we at the end
of this place already?

00:14:25.615 --> 00:14:26.991 position:50% align:center
Are you complaining?

00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:30.036 position:50% align:center
No. I just didn't expect
it to end so soon.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.205 position:50% align:center
It almost feels too easy,
especially compared

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:33.623 position:50% align:center
to the other labyrinths.

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:36.334 position:50% align:center
I don't know, I thought
it was hard enough as is.

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:37.752 position:50% align:center
Besides, it's like you said,

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:40.422 position:50% align:center
to the people who've
always lived in this world,

00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:42.298 position:50% align:center
those visions would
be extra rough.

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:46.511 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:48.555 position:50% align:center
It'd be like going
through hell to them.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.396 position:50% align:center
Damn, look at that timing.

00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:58.606 position:50% align:center
Everything all right
on your side?

00:14:58.690 --> 00:14:59.691 position:50% align:center
How about you?

00:15:01.026 --> 00:15:02.193 position:50% align:center
Wait, is she hurt?

00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:04.863 position:50% align:center
[SHEA] Hey Kaori,
did you hurt your legs?

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:06.489 position:50% align:center
[TIO]
How is it that you're injured?

00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:08.366 position:50% align:center
Have you forgotten
your healing magic?

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.410 position:50% align:center
I appreciate the
concern, everyone,

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:12.787 position:50% align:center
but don't worry,
I'm totally fine.

00:15:12.871 --> 00:15:15.040 position:50% align:center
I'm kinda just being
spoiled at this point.

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:16.624 position:50% align:center
The hell? If you can
walk on your own now,

00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:17.751 position:50% align:center
you should've told me.

00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:18.877 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but...

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.463 position:50% align:center
Truth is, I could do
it the whole time.

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:23.798 position:50% align:center
Whatever, just get off.

00:15:23.882 --> 00:15:26.968 position:50% align:center
[TIO] So, what happened
while we were gone? Eh?

00:15:27.052 --> 00:15:28.970 position:50% align:center
Please spare no detail, Master!

00:15:29.054 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
Did you get down
and dirty with Kaori?

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:31.723 position:50% align:center
I must know!

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:35.602 position:50% align:center
[TIO] Oh, haven't felt
that in a while.

00:15:37.187 --> 00:15:39.564 position:50% align:center
So, what did happen?

00:15:39.647 --> 00:15:42.192 position:50% align:center
Oh, I just shared a
little kiss with Hajime.

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:45.987 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Really? Who like,
initiated it? You? Him? Both?

00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:47.572 position:50% align:center
[KAORI]
I did.

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:50.408 position:50% align:center
Hajime got angry that
something bad happened to me

00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:52.660 position:50% align:center
and my brain just
said go for it.

00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:55.622 position:50% align:center
Wow! That's like beat-for-beat
what happened to me!

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:57.374 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:59.793 position:50% align:center
And here I thought you'd
give up and go away.

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:02.921 position:50% align:center
Makes sense.

00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:05.215 position:50% align:center
Hajime recommended that,
and to be honest,

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:06.966 position:50% align:center
I considered it.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.343 position:50% align:center
But nope.

00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:11.054 position:50% align:center
It's not like you being special
to him is news anyway.

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:12.847 position:50% align:center
So you don't mind?

00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:14.474 position:50% align:center
I guess you could say that.

00:16:14.557 --> 00:16:17.185 position:50% align:center
And besides, I didn't
listen to him when I first

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:18.436 position:50% align:center
tagged along.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.355 position:50% align:center
So why start now,
just because I remembered

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:22.107 position:50% align:center
how far ahead of me you are?

00:16:24.526 --> 00:16:26.695 position:50% align:center
Wish he didn't see
me like that, though.

00:16:26.778 --> 00:16:30.115 position:50% align:center
If you're so torn up,
you could always quit.

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:32.325 position:50% align:center
What's this? Am I a threat?

00:16:32.409 --> 00:16:33.743 position:50% align:center
Don't get carried away.

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:38.331 position:50% align:center
After today, I know that I'm
someone important to Hajime.

00:16:38.415 --> 00:16:39.457 position:50% align:center
So, from now on,

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:42.293 position:50% align:center
I'll try to become
someone special,

00:16:42.377 --> 00:16:44.212 position:50% align:center
no matter who wants
to get in my way.

00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:47.298 position:50% align:center
Fine.

00:16:47.382 --> 00:16:49.926 position:50% align:center
In that case, I accept
your challenge again.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.026 position:50% align:center
Found it.
The power of restoration.

00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center
I warn you,
don't cling to that god.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.174 position:50% align:center
Make your own decisions.

00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:31.676 position:50% align:center
Move forward on your own feet.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.096 position:50% align:center
Only those with a free
will shall be happy.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.607 position:50% align:center
The proof of conquest.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.068 position:50% align:center
If my math is right,
we've got four now!

00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:49.527 position:50% align:center
Which means we can
take on the labyrinth

00:17:49.611 --> 00:17:50.904 position:50% align:center
at the Sea of Trees!

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:51.905 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:01.331 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Ah, great!

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:03.625 position:50% align:center
This one's forcing us out too!

00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:05.210 position:50% align:center
Yue, spatial magic!

00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:11.132 position:50% align:center
Where the hell are we now?

00:18:24.229 --> 00:18:25.605 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:27.649 position:50% align:center
We knew it's unkillable
and can melt stuff,

00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
but it can control water, too?

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:31.403 position:50% align:center
What are we supposed to do?

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:34.698 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
This isn't good.

00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:37.075 position:50% align:center
Last time we
attacked it with fire,

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:38.993 position:50% align:center
but we were in
an air pocket then.

00:18:41.913 --> 00:18:42.956 position:50% align:center
I know!

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:51.548 position:50% align:center
Safe to assume we can't
use Yue and Tio's fire magic.

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.008 position:50% align:center
So instead...

00:18:53.091 --> 00:18:55.593 position:50% align:center
[YUE]
Hajime, you have an idea?

00:18:55.677 --> 00:18:58.179 position:50% align:center
There's one way to
use fire underwater.

00:18:58.263 --> 00:19:00.807 position:50% align:center
We vaporize that sludge
faster than it can regenerate

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.851 position:50% align:center
with a barrage of bombs.

00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:04.477 position:50% align:center
Maybe we'll get lucky.

00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:06.563 position:50% align:center
Really? Do you think
that could work?

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:08.189 position:50% align:center
Yeah, if I have enough time.

00:19:08.273 --> 00:19:09.566 position:50% align:center
Gimme three minutes.

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:11.526 position:50% align:center
Then we obliterate
the son of a bitch.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.198 position:50% align:center
It's gonna swallow us whole!

00:19:17.282 --> 00:19:21.286 position:50% align:center
If it comes down to it, I'll
transform to protect everyone!

00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:23.163 position:50% align:center
Dammit. I need more time.

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:25.331 position:50% align:center
[LEHMAN]
Hey, Hajime, my boy!

00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:26.875 position:50% align:center
Lemme lend you a fin.

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:35.717 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Lehman?!

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.262 position:50% align:center
That's right! It's your ol'
buddy Lehman, in the flesh!

00:19:39.346 --> 00:19:41.097 position:50% align:center
So lemme make
sure I got this right,

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:43.099 position:50% align:center
you need three minutes to prep
and then you can take out 

00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:44.476 position:50% align:center
the Devourer?

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:46.561 position:50% align:center
I don't know why you're
here or how you heard that,

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:47.937 position:50% align:center
but yeah, thanks!

00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:49.773 position:50% align:center
[LEHMAN]
Hey, Shea's here too.

00:19:49.856 --> 00:19:51.649 position:50% align:center
I didn't expect to run
into you, Lehman!

00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:52.859 position:50% align:center
What're you doing here?

00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:54.986 position:50% align:center
Eh, nothing special,
just swimmin' around,

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:57.197 position:50% align:center
like you do, when
suddenly I noticed a huge,

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.199 position:50% align:center
familiar magic power.

00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:01.659 position:50% align:center
I sensed trouble,
so I rushed in.

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:04.996 position:50% align:center
Are those other fish
your friends, or?

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.164 position:50% align:center
[LEHMAN]
You could say that.

00:20:06.247 --> 00:20:08.333 position:50% align:center
I guided them using my powers.

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:09.834 position:50% align:center
Oh...

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:12.587 position:50% align:center
Say, I've got the lowdown on
this Devourer monster thing.

00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:15.799 position:50% align:center
It is an ancient creature that
lives right in this here sea.

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:17.967 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's practically a
sentient natural disaster,

00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:19.052 position:50% align:center
if you ask me!

00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:20.136 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Done!

00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:29.396 position:50% align:center
You seemed hungry, so...

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:30.522 position:50% align:center
Eat up!

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.568 position:50% align:center
[GROUP yells]

00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:38.196 position:50% align:center
[LEHMAN] Warn me before setting
off an explosion next time!

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:40.031 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Sorry! See ya!

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:46.204 position:50% align:center
[YUUKA] Pope Ishtar said
Ms. Aiko would be back

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:48.540 position:50% align:center
from the Divine Mountain soon.

00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:51.960 position:50% align:center
It's already been three
days with no sign of her.

00:20:52.043 --> 00:20:54.004 position:50% align:center
Lily's not back either.

00:20:54.087 --> 00:20:57.340 position:50% align:center
The king said there's
nothing to worry about, but...

00:20:57.424 --> 00:21:00.427 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which,
Nia's gone too, isn't she?

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:01.594 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Yeah.

00:21:01.678 --> 00:21:04.347 position:50% align:center
So many people missing
at once is scary.

00:21:04.431 --> 00:21:07.517 position:50% align:center
Hey, why don't we ask the
guards what's going on?

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.145 position:50% align:center
[ATSUSHI] I had the exact
same thought, but I looked,

00:21:10.228 --> 00:21:12.105 position:50% align:center
and I can't find them anywhere.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.233 position:50% align:center
[MELD]
What's wrong?

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:16.401 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Captain Meld.

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:18.611 position:50% align:center
[YUUKA]
We're worried about Ms. Aiko.

00:21:18.695 --> 00:21:20.280 position:50% align:center
What's your concern?

00:21:20.363 --> 00:21:22.365 position:50% align:center
I know she went to the
Divine Mountain to discuss

00:21:22.449 --> 00:21:24.034 position:50% align:center
the Nagumo issue.

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:26.077 position:50% align:center
[TAEKO] That's the problem,
she hasn't come back.

00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:27.537 position:50% align:center
I hadn't heard that.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.498 position:50% align:center
And that's not all,
the guards are gone, too.

00:21:30.582 --> 00:21:33.251 position:50% align:center
A single missing person
is one thing, but this many?

00:21:34.586 --> 00:21:35.879 position:50% align:center
I was afraid of this.

00:21:37.964 --> 00:21:41.426 position:50% align:center
Truthfully, we've been
doing our own investigation.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:52.395 position:50% align:center
[NOINT] You must understand
that my lord feels

00:21:52.479 --> 00:21:55.774 position:50% align:center
what you are trying to do
is an inconvenience.

00:21:55.857 --> 00:21:58.068 position:50% align:center
He's far more interested
in what your student

00:21:58.151 --> 00:22:01.154 position:50% align:center
is attempting to do, you see.

00:22:01.237 --> 00:22:03.573 position:50% align:center
Therefore, you will stay here.

00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:06.743 position:50% align:center
Until the right time comes,
you will temporarily leave

00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:08.286 position:50% align:center
my lord's game board.

00:23:41.796 --> 00:23:44.132 position:50% align:center
