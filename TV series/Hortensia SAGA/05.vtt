We're Camellian warriors,
so show them what that means!

Huh?

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.423 position:50% align:center
I know you've been waiting.
My apologies.

Olivier's Dominion.

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:35.071 position:50% align:center
One of two great principalities

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:38.283 position:50% align:center
that served the
Kingdom of Hortensia.

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:40.410 position:50% align:center
The wise leader Leon D. Olivier

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:42.871 position:50% align:center
saw the land through
a prosperous era,

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:44.914 position:50% align:center
but the beloved duke
met his demise

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:47.417 position:50% align:center
the night of Rugis's uprising.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.044 position:50% align:center
The late duke's
adopted daughter,

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:52.672 position:50% align:center
Adelheid was to succeed him
as ruler of Olivier.

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:54.132 position:50% align:center
However, due to objection by

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:56.468 position:50% align:center
an orthodox faction
of the nobility,

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:59.346 position:50% align:center
the once proud dominion
was stripped of its title

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:03.266 position:50% align:center
and annexed into the kingdom
as one of its territories.

I knew this Rugis fellow was
low, but I did not fully fathom

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:17.072 position:50% align:center
the depths to which
he would sink.

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:18.281 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON]
I believe an all-out war

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.950 position:50% align:center
with Camellia is
inevitable at this point.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:24.162 position:50% align:center
And unfortunately,
those we once called allies

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:25.872 position:50% align:center
have yet to align with us.

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
You mean Olivier.

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:30.835 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON] Anyone who
chooses to harbor a witch

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.588 position:50% align:center

Ooh! Those look yummy, moru!

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:50.980 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
It's pretty smart of them to use

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.941 position:50% align:center
canals to transport goods.

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:54.651 position:50% align:center
But of course,
they'd make use of the water

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:56.486 position:50% align:center
since Olivier's
so close to the sea.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.697 position:50% align:center
Wow! You sure do know
a lot about this place!

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.573 position:50% align:center
Hey, stay sharp.

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:02.992 position:50% align:center
We didn't come here
to admire the scenery.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.203 position:50% align:center
I know. We're just
talking, is all.

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:06.913 position:50% align:center
Why are we here?

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:08.540 position:50% align:center
The captain has
plenty of messengers

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:11.084 position:50% align:center
at his disposal,
so, why send us?

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:13.420 position:50% align:center
You have something better to do?

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:15.672 position:50% align:center
Georg is forced to be
a little more discreet

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:18.550 position:50% align:center
because of the position he's in.

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:20.510 position:50% align:center
Presently in the
Orthodox Church,

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:23.138 position:50% align:center
two sizable factions
have emerged.

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.056 position:50% align:center
Those of us who are
considered moderates

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center
and choose to follow
the original teachings,

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:31.146 position:50% align:center
and a more radical group
centered around Sir Didier.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.356 position:50% align:center
They heavily tax the people
under the pretext

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.983 position:50% align:center
of strengthening the nation

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:37.569 position:50% align:center
and believe in ruling
with an iron fist.

00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:39.696 position:50% align:center
Then the knights who attacked us

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.698 position:50% align:center
were a part of
this faction, yes?

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:43.283 position:50% align:center
Probably.

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.118 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] Things will most
likely get more difficult

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center
for the moderates
now that the pope has

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:49.039 position:50% align:center
promoted Sir Didier.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:53.209 position:50% align:center
It would be reassuring
to have trustworthy allies.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.503 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] Olivier has
always had a fair amount

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:57.547 position:50% align:center
of influence over the kingdom.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he'll go
to great lengths

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:00.175 position:50% align:center
to have them on his side.

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:02.344 position:50% align:center
And we'll walk those
great lengths.

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:03.970 position:50% align:center
I can't believe we
came all the way here

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:05.555 position:50% align:center
just to deliver a message.

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:07.682 position:50% align:center
I might change my tune
if we had the promise

00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:10.352 position:50% align:center
of beautiful women
or treasure, but we don't.

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:13.605 position:50% align:center
You know, Commander Adelheid
is a fairly impressive woman.

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:15.106 position:50% align:center
And she's the one we're meeting.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.734 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you tell me this
delightful news sooner, huh?

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:19.944 position:50% align:center
Would you say
she's pretty or cute?

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:22.489 position:50% align:center
I prefer ladies who're pretty,
but cute ones are okay.

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:23.740 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Who cares?

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
She's "pretty" good
with a spear.

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:26.826 position:50% align:center
For whatever that's worth.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.621 position:50% align:center
That's not the kind of pretty
I meant, m'lord! Let me...

00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:31.748 position:50% align:center
Hope she's been well.

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:33.041 position:50% align:center
Maybe you should hide.

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:36.378 position:50% align:center
I was just thinking
the same thing, moru.

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:37.796 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Sorry, Qoo.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:45.261 position:50% align:center
Greetings, Lord Alfred.
It's been a while.

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.847 position:50% align:center
In fact, I thought
this day might never come.

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.433 position:50% align:center
You remember me.
I'm truly honored.

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:51.768 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID]
And you, Maurice?

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:54.562 position:50% align:center
I'm fine. Glad to see
that you haven't changed.

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:57.565 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes. My squire,
Marius Casterede.

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:59.275 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Wait.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:03.279 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] And me? I am the
one and only Deflotte Danois.

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:07.033 position:50% align:center
After seeing my combat skills,
Alfred took me on as a squire.

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:08.993 position:50% align:center
It's my intent to become
a full-fledged knight

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:11.371 position:50% align:center
and devote myself
to the kingdom.

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:15.333 position:50% align:center
Which of course means
I am at your service, my lady.

00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:18.545 position:50% align:center
My! How very chivalrous.

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:21.423 position:50% align:center
I'm so pleased to see you have
such love for Hortensia.

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:23.550 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] Oh, but serving
Hortensia isn't even

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:25.802 position:50% align:center
half as appealing as serving
an exquisite woman

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:27.470 position:50% align:center
such as yourself, Lady Ad--

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:28.722 position:50% align:center
Stop, she's heard enough.

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:30.682 position:50% align:center
What do you mean
she's heard enough?

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.058 position:50% align:center
I didn't even get to
the good part!

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:33.351 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] You shouldn't
have spent so much time

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:35.103 position:50% align:center
on the bad part.

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:37.647 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] What part of
that sounded bad? Hm?

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:42.152 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID] I see. Among the
Ecclesiastical Knights,

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:43.987 position:50% align:center
Captain Georg's
one of the few who's

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.740 position:50% align:center
maintained his integrity
all these years.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:49.701 position:50% align:center
I would like to be able to
comply and offer support.

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:51.202 position:50% align:center
Then I'll inform the captain.

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:54.706 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID] Not yet.
I haven't given you my response.

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.666 position:50% align:center
Is something the matter?

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.376 position:50% align:center
For the past few days,

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.087 position:50% align:center
we've had reports of
suspicious activity.

00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:02.422 position:50% align:center
They've all occurred
at the mouth

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.966 position:50% align:center
of the Torrent River
to the southeast.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.843 position:50% align:center
It would be careless
to call back the men

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:09.679 position:50% align:center
we used to strengthen
security in the area.

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:13.350 position:50% align:center
My apologies,
but I can't help just yet.

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:16.061 position:50% align:center
That's my response to
the captain as of now.

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:18.855 position:50% align:center
[QOO]
It'd be less disappointing

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:21.024 position:50% align:center
if we hadn't traveled
so far, moru.

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.443 position:50% align:center
All it took was an
eyeful of Lady Adelheid

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:26.654 position:50% align:center
to make the journey
completely worthwhile to me.

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:28.907 position:50% align:center
Ooh! Though I guess
there's one more thing

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.201 position:50% align:center
that'd make this trip
worthwhile and that's

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.703 position:50% align:center
downing a few pints
of some nice, cold ale!

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:36.664 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] Does his
buffoonery never cease?

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:40.669 position:50% align:center
Um. Do you know why
Lady Adelheid told us

00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:43.421 position:50% align:center
we could go but asked
Alfred to stay behind?

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:45.090 position:50% align:center
The night Rugis
struck the capital

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:48.051 position:50% align:center
and staged his insurrection,
they both lost their fathers.

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.469 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:51.846 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] I imagine they have
some catching up to do.

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:58.812 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID] I'm sorry I can't be
of more help at this time.

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:01.731 position:50% align:center
Don't be. Had our roles
been reversed,

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:04.109 position:50% align:center
I would've made
the same decision as you.

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:09.239 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID] My first priority
is keeping Olivier safe

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:11.116 position:50% align:center
no matter what the cost.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:14.869 position:50% align:center
My father loved this land,
therefore I'll protect it.

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:18.498 position:50% align:center
Duke Leon, an impeccable
knight till the end.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.875 position:50% align:center
When I was younger,
I actually thought

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:23.211 position:50% align:center
I'd be able to catch up to him.

00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:30.844 position:50% align:center
You've learned a lot,
but not nearly enough.

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:33.346 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID]
You won't beat me this time!

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.682 position:50% align:center
You definitely have the spirit.

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:38.435 position:50% align:center
That said, you need to
close in more.

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:39.644 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:42.313 position:50% align:center
Don't rely on
mere reach, Adelheid.

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:44.941 position:50% align:center
Not if you want to
claim victory, at least.

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:48.028 position:50% align:center
[LEON]
Just think of it this way.

00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:50.572 position:50% align:center
Tides of battle are much
like tides of the sea.

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:53.158 position:50% align:center
They can change in an instant.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.076 position:50% align:center
You must anticipate
those changes

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.579 position:50% align:center
and charge in when
an opening presents itself.

00:08:57.662 --> 00:08:59.581 position:50% align:center
But if for some
reason you can't,

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:02.751 position:50% align:center
I guarantee you'll never
win a fight against me.

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:06.504 position:50% align:center

[CAMELLIAN SOLDIER 5L]
Hurry!

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center
Uh, am I missing
something here?

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:01.229 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Hold it! Come back and fight!

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:03.189 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID]
Why are you running?

00:17:03.273 --> 00:17:06.776 position:50% align:center
Did you not invade so you could
claim Olivier as your own?

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:10.655 position:50% align:center
My actions were
meant to protect you.

00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:14.701 position:50% align:center
That doesn't make sense!
Roy, we're no longer comrades!

00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:19.873 position:50% align:center
Ha. Same old Adelheid.
No matter what.

00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:22.459 position:50% align:center
Always so straightforward.

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:24.002 position:50% align:center
So noble.

00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:33.887 position:50% align:center
[VICE COMMANDER 5A]
You will now accompany us

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.514 position:50% align:center
to the capital,
just as you agreed.

00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:39.017 position:50% align:center
Are you guys really
still barking about that?

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.977 position:50% align:center
Perhaps if we talked--

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:42.562 position:50% align:center
It's okay, Alfred.

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:45.523 position:50% align:center
Think of it as another way
I'm protecting Olivier.

00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:53.740 position:50% align:center
Come on, Alfred, please!
Do something!

00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:57.786 position:50% align:center
My actions were
meant to protect you.

00:17:57.869 --> 00:18:02.248 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Um, just a moment,
Sir Didier!

00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:03.792 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
Is this important?

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:06.753 position:50% align:center
Yes, I think you'll find it is.

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:09.339 position:50% align:center
We managed to repel
the Camellian forces.

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:10.465 position:50% align:center
But without the
commander's help,

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:12.592 position:50% align:center
the battle would've been lost.

00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:15.553 position:50% align:center
I assure you today's victory
is only temporary.

00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:17.180 position:50% align:center
Their attacks are
likely to continue until

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:19.474 position:50% align:center
they achieve their
desired outcome.

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:21.017 position:50% align:center
Removing the commander
from her station

00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:23.645 position:50% align:center
will prove much too dangerous.

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:25.438 position:50% align:center
It was mentioned before,

00:18:25.522 --> 00:18:28.108 position:50% align:center
but if this land falls,
the capital's next.

00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:32.237 position:50% align:center
And as the order charged with
keeping the entire kingdom safe,

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.988 position:50% align:center
I'm very curious
to know how you'll

00:18:34.072 --> 00:18:37.158 position:50% align:center
motivate Adelheid's
troops in her absence.

00:18:37.242 --> 00:18:39.619 position:50% align:center
[VICE COMMANDER 5A] Her arrest
is not open for discussion!

00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:42.455 position:50% align:center
Try all you like,
but our judgment is final!

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:44.165 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
No, release her.

00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:45.875 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:49.879 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] Your words are indeed
laced with quite a bit of logic.

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:52.632 position:50% align:center
I witnessed Lady Adelheid's
loyalty to the kingdom

00:18:52.716 --> 00:18:56.386 position:50% align:center
firsthand as she bravely fought
to drive back the enemy.

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:59.222 position:50% align:center
Therefore, we'll hold off
on taking her for now.

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:01.057 position:50% align:center
[ALL sigh]

00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:02.892 position:50% align:center
Thanks for reconsidering.

00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:05.145 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] I hope you understand
this does not mean

00:19:05.228 --> 00:19:07.981 position:50% align:center
she is completely
cleared of suspicion.

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:10.608 position:50% align:center
In time, we shall return.

00:19:13.194 --> 00:19:15.238 position:50% align:center
Bastard. Who's he think he is?

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:18.950 position:50% align:center
Cuttin' it real close,
but it turned out all right.

00:19:19.034 --> 00:19:20.368 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:27.250 position:50% align:center
It's been a while since
I've seen Alfred, moru.

00:19:27.334 --> 00:19:31.046 position:50% align:center
Where do you think he
wandered off? Qoo!

00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:37.218 position:50% align:center
[QOO] So, he's been with
Adelheid this whole time, moru.

00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:40.638 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID]
I don't know how to thank you.

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:43.099 position:50% align:center
I only did what
needed to be done.

00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:46.144 position:50% align:center
Should you encounter any trouble
further down the road,

00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:48.855 position:50% align:center
you will always be welcome
within our borders.

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:53.443 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Lady Adelheid.

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:59.908 position:50% align:center
Our true enemy, no,
the enemy of all Hortensia.

00:19:59.991 --> 00:20:01.493 position:50% align:center
Who is it?

00:20:02.869 --> 00:20:04.662 position:50% align:center
I wish I knew.

00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:06.331 position:50% align:center
Why is the church
depriving citizens

00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:08.291 position:50% align:center
of their peaceful lives?

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:10.502 position:50% align:center
Why target you, of all people?

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:12.962 position:50% align:center
Just for trying to
find the princess.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.840 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] When I took up
my father's sword,

00:20:15.924 --> 00:20:18.426 position:50% align:center
I chose the path of a fighter.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.553 position:50% align:center
But what is it I'm fighting now?

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:30.730 position:50% align:center
[ROY]
Theresia.

00:20:30.814 --> 00:20:32.190 position:50% align:center
What's going on with Adelheid?

00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:34.401 position:50% align:center
I can't tell for sure.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.362 position:50% align:center
Despite having precognition,

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:39.781 position:50% align:center
you have no idea what
became of her afterward?

00:20:39.864 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:44.744 position:50% align:center
My powers can be confusing
even to me at times.

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:46.538 position:50% align:center
What a crazy plan.

00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:49.874 position:50% align:center
I can't help but wonder what
goes on in his head sometimes.

00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:51.376 position:50% align:center
[RUGIS]
Hmm.

00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:54.713 position:50% align:center
So, you say Adelheid is
going to be thrown in prison.

00:20:54.796 --> 00:20:58.049 position:50% align:center
As of now,
that is the future I saw.

00:20:59.092 --> 00:21:00.468 position:50% align:center
Ready our soldiers.

00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:02.220 position:50% align:center
And set a course for Olivier.

00:21:02.303 --> 00:21:03.638 position:50% align:center
Yes, m'lord.

00:21:03.722 --> 00:21:06.516 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I fail to see how
attacking her solves this!

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:08.560 position:50% align:center
It gives her a chance
to prove herself.

00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:10.103 position:50% align:center
It's smart, yes?

00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:12.397 position:50% align:center
She'll defend her land
right before their eyes.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.565 position:50% align:center
Who'd imprison someone who

00:21:13.648 --> 00:21:15.650 position:50% align:center
fought the kingdom's
primary foe?

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:16.818 position:50% align:center
So, you mean you're actually

00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:18.737 position:50% align:center
protecting her from
the Orthodox Church!

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.865 position:50% align:center
Do not presume
to know my methods.

00:21:21.948 --> 00:21:23.742 position:50% align:center
She sides with
a faction of the kingdom

00:21:23.825 --> 00:21:25.869 position:50% align:center
that opposes the pope.

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:29.080 position:50% align:center
The more divided
Hortensia becomes, the better.

00:21:29.164 --> 00:21:31.958 position:50% align:center
It stacks more odds
in our favor.

00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:34.169 position:50% align:center
Nothing more and nothing less.

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:37.881 position:50% align:center
Do you really believe
that he meant what he said?

00:21:37.964 --> 00:21:39.007 position:50% align:center
As I mentioned before,

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.217 position:50% align:center
there's no telling
what he's thinking.

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:44.179 position:50% align:center
And yet, it's fine.

00:21:44.262 --> 00:21:47.265 position:50% align:center
I know why I put
my faith in him.

00:21:47.349 --> 00:21:49.434 position:50% align:center
Because he's
a knight among knights.

00:21:49.517 --> 00:21:51.519 position:50% align:center
He dedicates every
second of every day

00:21:51.603 --> 00:21:53.563 position:50% align:center
to fighting for his people,

00:21:53.646 --> 00:21:57.901 position:50% align:center
his friends, and those
he holds most dear.

00:23:33.163 --> 00:23:35.373 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] I shall fulfill
my duty to lead the people.

00:23:35.457 --> 00:23:37.542 position:50% align:center
[JIM] Your wish is my command,
Princess Marielle.

00:23:37.625 --> 00:23:38.918 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
That's not why we came, though.

00:23:39.002 --> 00:23:40.253 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
And I do want to be free.

00:23:40.337 --> 00:23:41.838 position:50% align:center
[JIM]
I will protect her with my life!

00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:43.715 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] She has got to be
stopped at any cost!

00:23:43.798 --> 00:23:46.468 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Farewell. For now!
