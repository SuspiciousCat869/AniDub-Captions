[MAURICE] It'd be best
if you cut your hair.

00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:18.059 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:20.687 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] I realize the
affront of this suggestion,

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.024 position:50% align:center
but we don't have the option of
altering your face or voice.

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:25.525 position:50% align:center
We need to fool people,

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:27.819 position:50% align:center
and cutting your hair
would do the trick.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:36.119 position:50% align:center
I'll give you a moment.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:39.873 position:50% align:center
We'll have to
think of a new name

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:41.583 position:50% align:center
to go with your
disguise as well.

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.585 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE gasps]

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:45.712 position:50% align:center
From this day forward,
you have no choice

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:48.340 position:50% align:center
but to live under
an assumed identity.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.691 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] First, she witnessed
her father's murder,

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:09.569 position:50% align:center
now she's being
driven from her land.

00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:12.906 position:50% align:center
Anyone would have a hard time
accepting what happened.

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:16.159 position:50% align:center
The princess's young age
makes it even harder.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:19.371 position:50% align:center
But this is her reality.

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:56.259 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] The fantastical
paradise, Magonia.

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:58.386 position:50% align:center
A place only spoken of
in legends,

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.597 position:50% align:center
brimming with a
"great power" that is said

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.640 position:50% align:center
to make any wish come true.

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:04.517 position:50% align:center

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:10.690 position:50% align:center
The stories detailed
in Magonian lore

00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:12.650 position:50% align:center
were as old as time itself.

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.694 position:50% align:center
Known by every man,
woman, and child

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:17.489 position:50% align:center
throughout the kingdom
of Hortensia.

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:19.574 position:50% align:center
But then, what were
once believed to be

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:21.701 position:50% align:center
imaginary creatures
began appearing

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.787 position:50% align:center
right before their eyes.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.538 position:50% align:center
As days turned into months,

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:29.167 position:50% align:center
the people of Hortensia came to
accept the horrifying truth

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.213 position:50% align:center
that these mythical
monsters were very real.

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.188 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED sighs]
That should do it.

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:53.149 position:50% align:center
Not that there were many
monsters to slay to begin with,

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:56.486 position:50% align:center
but I have to wonder why
you're slaying them yourself.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.365 position:50% align:center
Because it's my job, that's why.
I have to safeguard my people.

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:02.283 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] I could've sworn
knights and mercenaries

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:03.743 position:50% align:center
have that job, too.

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:06.621 position:50% align:center
We'll have to cross blades
with Camellia again one day.

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:09.457 position:50% align:center
I'd rather keep their
loads light before then.

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:13.503 position:50% align:center
Another reason is I need
the training more than anybody.

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:16.131 position:50% align:center
I can't beat Roy as I am now.

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:22.595 position:50% align:center
I just realized it,
but you're short a squire.

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:26.266 position:50% align:center
Doesn't Marius usually
tag along on these patrols?

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.476 position:50% align:center
He's already improved
enough as it is.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.271 position:50% align:center
So, I entrusted him
with another mission.

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:36.651 position:50% align:center
My arms, moru.
I can't take it any-moru!

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:38.695 position:50% align:center
This errand was
a lot livelier than usual

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:40.864 position:50% align:center
thanks to the two of you!

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:43.366 position:50% align:center
Alfred is gonna pay.
Just wait and see.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.243 position:50% align:center
Moru.

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:47.871 position:50% align:center
If you're starting to get tired,
then maybe we should switch.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.832 position:50% align:center
This is a man's job, so I've
got it all under control!

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
[QOO] Huh? I didn't notice
you had flowers, moru.

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:59.215 position:50% align:center
Oh. These are for a place I'd
like to visit along the way.

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:07.015 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA]
Whenever I go out on an errand,

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
I always come and
offer a prayer to

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.478 position:50% align:center
the members of the Albert
family who've passed.

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:13.438 position:50% align:center
Lord Fernando,
his wife, Hortense,

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:15.774 position:50% align:center
and their little daughter,
Berna, as well.

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:18.234 position:50% align:center
Berna. That's short
for Bernadette,

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:20.070 position:50% align:center
who was Alfred's younger sister.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:22.906 position:50% align:center
Aw. Would've been
nice to meet her.

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:26.201 position:50% align:center
It's been about four
years since she died.

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:27.619 position:50% align:center
Lord Fernando took me in

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:30.205 position:50% align:center
when my own family
had passed on.

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:32.082 position:50% align:center
And though I may have
been just a maid,

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:33.792 position:50% align:center
he, Alfred, and Berna
welcomed me

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:37.671 position:50% align:center
with such unbelievably
warm, open arms.

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:40.173 position:50% align:center
Berna and I
hit it off right away!

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:43.426 position:50% align:center
I think it helped that
we were the same age.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.097 position:50% align:center
But she was born with
a very weak constitution,

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.349 position:50% align:center
so she spent
every day in her room,

00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:51.267 position:50% align:center
gazing out her window.

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:54.104 position:50% align:center
She was the nicest,
most intelligent girl!

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:56.898 position:50% align:center
She would even take
the time to read to me!

00:05:56.981 --> 00:06:00.110 position:50% align:center
I used to really
cherish those moments.

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.653 position:50% align:center
I still do.

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:06.032 position:50% align:center
But then, without any warning,
Berna said goodbye to us.

00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:07.742 position:50% align:center
The carriage she was
riding in that day

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:10.495 position:50% align:center
got caught in
a terrible landslide.

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:13.832 position:50% align:center
She was like family.

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:15.250 position:50% align:center
All of the Alberts are.

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:18.670 position:50% align:center
Precious family members
that I hold close to my heart.

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:22.549 position:50% align:center
That's why I keep Alfred
company the best that I can!

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:24.134 position:50% align:center
Whether that be through
doing laundry,

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:26.845 position:50% align:center
or cooking, or cleaning,
or some other chore.

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:31.307 position:50% align:center
If it's bringing life
to the manor, then I'm in!

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:34.352 position:50% align:center
I wish that I could do
as much as you do, Nonnoria.

00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:36.021 position:50% align:center
I won't even entertain
that notion

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:37.564 position:50% align:center
when you practically
have the world

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:38.898 position:50% align:center
on your shoulders as it is!

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:42.277 position:50% align:center
Wait! As a man, I refuse
to let you carry that!

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:49.075 position:50% align:center
[DORIS]
Marius! Nonnoria!

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:51.036 position:50% align:center
Hey, you two! How goes?

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:55.206 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA] Conny and Dorris!
Two of my favorite people ever!

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.332 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't happen
to know when

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:57.876 position:50% align:center
the lord's gonna
take care of the monster

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:00.003 position:50% align:center
that lives in
Tron Cavern, would you?

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.255 position:50% align:center
That is a very good
question, indeed.

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:03.506 position:50% align:center
There's a monster?

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.758 position:50% align:center
You're kidding, right?

00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:07.010 position:50% align:center
It's a creature from
Magonian lore.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:08.636 position:50% align:center
According to the legends of old,

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.347 position:50% align:center
there's a shape-shifting
monster that dwells

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.599 position:50% align:center
at the spring inside
Tron Cavern.

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:14.267 position:50% align:center
They say the monster
can transform

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:16.019 position:50% align:center
into anything in the world!

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:19.481 position:50% align:center
It could be a dragon, or a
snake, or even a giant wolf!

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:20.523 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:26.780 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:28.990 position:50% align:center
No. I'm just thinking, is all.

00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:32.869 position:50% align:center
Aw. It'd be neat if I
could see it in real life.

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:36.039 position:50% align:center
I feel like there's an important
detail I'm forgetting.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:39.084 position:50% align:center
Don't be dumb.
There's no way it really exists.

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:40.335 position:50% align:center
Well, I think it does!

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:42.087 position:50% align:center
You better think again, Conny!

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.798 position:50% align:center
'Cause the priest says
Magonian stories aren't real!

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:46.549 position:50% align:center
They are too real, so hush!

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:50.136 position:50% align:center
Then why don't you go
see for yourself and prove it?

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.429 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Hey, now.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.640 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA]
Hello, my lord!

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:55.225 position:50% align:center
I trust your patrol
went smoothly.

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:56.893 position:50% align:center
Ah! My lord!

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:59.104 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Listen, Tron Cavern
is like a labyrinth.

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:00.522 position:50% align:center
It's dangerous.

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.941 position:50% align:center
Which means children
shouldn't venture there alone.

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:07.362 position:50% align:center
Aw. But I wanna see the monster
shape-shift so bad!

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:09.948 position:50% align:center
Like into a dragon, or a
snake, or even a giant--

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:10.949 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey!

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:12.325 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:14.661 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Did you just
remember something?

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:17.247 position:50% align:center
I, uh... Yeah.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.666 position:50% align:center
I remembered I'm mad at you
'cause you tricked me!

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:21.167 position:50% align:center
What?

00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:22.669 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] You said it was an
escort mission for Nonnoria,

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:24.546 position:50% align:center
but all I did was
carry her stuff!

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:27.424 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah, about that.

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:29.342 position:50% align:center
She tends to struggle
with loads like this,

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:31.094 position:50% align:center
so I felt kind of guilty.

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:32.512 position:50% align:center
You should carry it
to really feel

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:33.722 position:50% align:center
the weight of your conscience.

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:35.640 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA gasps]
No! Don't you dare!

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:37.100 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Why not? He has it coming!

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.184 position:50% align:center
[DORIS]
Conny!

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:41.479 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna prove it's real
with my own two eyes!

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:43.106 position:50% align:center
[DORIS]
Don't be ridiculous, Conny.

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:44.733 position:50% align:center
You're the biggest
scaredy-cat I know.

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:46.067 position:50% align:center
[CONNY]
No, I'm not!

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:50.655 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Considering
the safety of the children,

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:53.324 position:50% align:center
I think maybe we should
go and check it out.

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:56.369 position:50% align:center
Are you listening?

00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:57.370 position:50% align:center
Wah! Hot! Hot! Hot!

00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:58.705 position:50% align:center
Ah! Sorry, Qoo!

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.540 position:50% align:center
You poor little thing!

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:03.877 position:50% align:center
That was mean, moru!

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.253 position:50% align:center
Are you okay, Qoo?

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:06.379 position:50% align:center
Moru.

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:08.131 position:50% align:center
Let's go get you washed up!

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:09.507 position:50% align:center
Yes, let's, moru.

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:10.550 position:50% align:center
So, you were saying?

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:12.552 position:50% align:center
We should investigate
Tron Cavern.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:13.928 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:16.681 position:50% align:center
You do realize the beast
is a myth, it's not real.

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:19.476 position:50% align:center
They used to say the same thing
about a lot of monsters,

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.186 position:50% align:center
but ever since Rugis's uprising,

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:23.563 position:50% align:center
they've been appearing
all over Hortensia.

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:26.107 position:50% align:center
You think this monster
is somehow the exception?

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:27.776 position:50% align:center
Because I don't.

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:29.402 position:50% align:center
I see your point.

00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:31.905 position:50% align:center
What are your thoughts, Marius?

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:34.032 position:50% align:center
Well, um-- Honestly?

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:37.619 position:50% align:center
I think that, yes,
we should go check it out.

00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:39.829 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] All right,
no time like the present.

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:42.457 position:50% align:center
If we're doing this,
let's be off at once.

00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:49.422 position:50% align:center
[howling]

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:51.424 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:53.760 position:50% align:center
Sorry! Thought I
heard something.

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:55.804 position:50% align:center
Tron Cavern is just up ahead.

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:57.055 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Good to know.

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:59.724 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?
Please, tell me if you're not.

00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:01.393 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
I'm fine.

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:05.271 position:50% align:center
I just really
can't stand wolves.

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:08.233 position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone has
things that get to them.

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:11.903 position:50% align:center
If a wolf shows up, Maurice and
I will handle it for you.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.242 position:50% align:center
Alfred, wait.

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:22.122 position:50% align:center
I heard the creature
that struck your father down

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:23.248 position:50% align:center
was a werewolf.

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:24.916 position:50% align:center
Is that not true?

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.295 position:50% align:center
It's true.

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:33.049 position:50% align:center
You harbor no fear or
hatred of wolves, though.

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:35.760 position:50% align:center
Father always stood by
his code of chivalry.

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:37.846 position:50% align:center
Right up until the very end.

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:41.516 position:50% align:center
Bearing a whole species ill will
because he died is wrong.

00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:45.478 position:50% align:center
Wow. Is that honestly
how you feel?

00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:50.025 position:50% align:center
Say a werewolf didn't
cause his death.

00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:51.651 position:50% align:center
Say it was something else.

00:10:51.735 --> 00:10:54.612 position:50% align:center
Do you think you'd see it
a little differently?

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:57.574 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] Hey! We'd burn
a lot less daylight

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:59.284 position:50% align:center
if you two'd pick up the pace!

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:01.036 position:50% align:center
Oh! Sorry!

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:12.672 position:50% align:center
[CONNY'S MOTHER] My lord!
Please, let me in! Please!

00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:15.675 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA]
Coming! Hello!

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:16.676 position:50% align:center
Nonnoria!

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.678 position:50% align:center
Whoa, calm down!
What's going on?

00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:20.055 position:50% align:center
Is the lord here?

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:21.973 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid he's out
on another patrol,

00:11:22.057 --> 00:11:25.727 position:50% align:center
ridding the area of monsters.
Did something happen?

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.605 position:50% align:center
My sweet, little, defenseless
Conny has gone missing!

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.023 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:32.567 position:50% align:center
I dunno for sure, but I think
he went to Tron Cavern.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.361 position:50% align:center
Why would he do that?

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:36.696 position:50% align:center
He wants to prove to me that

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.282 position:50% align:center
the monster at
the spring there is real!

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:40.992 position:50% align:center
So, this is all my fault!

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:43.370 position:50% align:center
It's actually a good thing
if he's at Tron Cavern,

00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:45.246 position:50% align:center
because that's where
Lord Alfred is, too.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.582 position:50% align:center
But he said it's a
labyrinth in there, right?

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:49.376 position:50% align:center
They may not even
see each other, moru.

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:53.171 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA gasps]
Don't you worry, Doris!

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:54.923 position:50% align:center
Just leave everything to me!

00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:57.467 position:50% align:center
I'll go find him
and bring him back!

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.054 position:50% align:center
This is terrible!
Truly and utterly terrible!

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:03.890 position:50% align:center
It's way too dangerous for you
to go there alone, moru.

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:06.768 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA]
I am well aware! But so what?

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:10.522 position:50% align:center
No time to second-guess
when time is of the essence!

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.148 position:50% align:center
[QOO]
Wait for me, moru!

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:14.401 position:50% align:center
Sit tight wherever
you are, Conny!

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:18.697 position:50% align:center
Nonnoria is coming to
rescue you and save the day!

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:26.496 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Watch out!

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:31.584 position:50% align:center
Didn't expect this place
to be a goblin den.

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:34.379 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'm already glad
that we came.

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:36.715 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
It's a dead end.

00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:39.634 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] Perhaps a sign
we should call it a day.

00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:42.971 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't be hard
to retrace our steps.

00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:46.516 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Let's just be
cautious not to get lost.

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.893 position:50% align:center
We're so lost.

00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:50.729 position:50% align:center
[QOO] I have a pretty
strong feeling we've been

00:12:50.812 --> 00:12:53.189 position:50% align:center
going in circles
for a while, moru.

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:57.777 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Where could
he be? Conny!

00:12:57.861 --> 00:12:58.945 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:05.410 position:50% align:center
[BOTH scream]

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:07.328 position:50% align:center
Why are there bones here? Why?

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:09.080 position:50% align:center
You don't think they're
Conny's bones, do you?

00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:11.374 position:50% align:center
No, there's absolutely no way!

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:14.627 position:50% align:center
[crying]

00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:16.963 position:50% align:center
It sounds like crying, moru.

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:20.342 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA]
You don't suppose...?

00:13:23.762 --> 00:13:24.846 position:50% align:center
Conny!

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:26.431 position:50% align:center
[CONNY]
Nonnoria!

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:28.183 position:50% align:center
You're okay, moru!

00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:30.393 position:50% align:center
Oh! What a relief!

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:34.731 position:50% align:center
I lost my way.
And then my lamp went out!

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:37.275 position:50% align:center
I thought I was gonna be
trapped in here forever.

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:38.818 position:50% align:center
Well, you can ease
your worried mind,

00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:40.987 position:50% align:center
because I'm here now.

00:13:41.071 --> 00:13:42.947 position:50% align:center
Let's hurry and
get you home, sound good?

00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:45.617 position:50% align:center
--[CONNY] Yeah.
--Moru!

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.701 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:48.620 position:50% align:center
[CONNY]
What's the matter?

00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:50.705 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA]
I forgot, we're lost, too.

00:13:50.789 --> 00:13:51.664 position:50% align:center
[QOO]
Moru.

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:52.791 position:50% align:center
[CONNY sighs]

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
It's no big deal!

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.711 position:50% align:center
We'll find an exit
if we keep moving!

00:13:56.795 --> 00:13:58.546 position:50% align:center
[ALL scream]

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.465 position:50% align:center
Run like the wind, moru!

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:03.009 position:50% align:center
[CONNY]
Your ribbon!

00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:05.220 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA]
Never mind that! Just run!

00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:07.347 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA screams]

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.808 position:50% align:center
[QOO] If anyone has a plan,
I am all ears!

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:12.143 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, this might
be it, moru!

00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:16.314 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA] Desperate times call
for desperate, secret weapons!

00:14:17.232 --> 00:14:18.149 position:50% align:center
[QOO gasps]

00:14:18.233 --> 00:14:19.401 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA grunts]

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:21.528 position:50% align:center
We'll wait until they're

00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:23.780 position:50% align:center
completely occupied
with the meat.

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.907 position:50% align:center
Then we'll run for it.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.327 position:50% align:center
Now's our chance to ge-- [gasps]

00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:31.371 position:50% align:center
[CONNY]
Why'd you bring this?

00:14:31.454 --> 00:14:32.664 position:50% align:center
It did have the meat, you know!

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:34.374 position:50% align:center
We need to hurry, moru!

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:38.420 position:50% align:center
--[CONNY] Oh, no!
--[QOO] We're blocked in! Moru!

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:40.380 position:50% align:center
This is bad.

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:42.549 position:50% align:center
[QOO]
We're done for, moru.

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:43.633 position:50% align:center
[CONNY]
Mama!

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:45.510 position:50% align:center
Hey, it'll be all right.

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:47.303 position:50% align:center
It's moments like this when he's

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:49.431 position:50% align:center
guaranteed to come
to our rescue.

00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:52.100 position:50% align:center
I have absolute faith
he'll save us!

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:55.562 position:50% align:center
Just like he did
before! I'm sure.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.149 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA]
Lord Alfred!

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:05.405 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You're actually here!

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:08.742 position:50% align:center
Maurice and Marius, too?

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:12.120 position:50% align:center
Is everyone okay?
Are you hurt?

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:13.955 position:50% align:center
Sorry for the delay.

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:20.295 position:50% align:center
[cries]

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:22.922 position:50% align:center
I believed in you
with all my heart!

00:15:23.006 --> 00:15:24.883 position:50% align:center
I just knew you could
sense we were in danger

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:26.926 position:50% align:center
and were on your way to save us!

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.428 position:50% align:center
Well, I had a little hint.

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:31.514 position:50% align:center
What? So, my ribbon helped?

00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:34.642 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Marius found it and
knew exactly whose it was.

00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:37.604 position:50% align:center
The three of us would be dead
right now if not for you!

00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:40.315 position:50% align:center
"Thank you" doesn't
seem like enough!

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:42.650 position:50% align:center
There.

00:15:43.735 --> 00:15:47.489 position:50% align:center
Now don't do anything
too crazy. All right?

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:50.450 position:50% align:center
I'll try not to.

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:52.118 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] Let's get out
of here before any other

00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:54.204 position:50% align:center
uglies decide to show up.

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:58.917 position:50% align:center
Good idea! Sorry in advance
if I slow you down!

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.085 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:01.252 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
What's that?

00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:02.337 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA]
Huh?

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center
[QOO]
Something there's glowing, moru.

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:06.591 position:50% align:center
You all wait here.

00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:09.094 position:50% align:center
Hey! Like hell I'm waiting!

00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:22.399 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] This must be
the Tron Cavern spring.

00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:27.195 position:50% align:center
Find anything?

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:30.490 position:50% align:center
Not really, just moonlight.

00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:32.242 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:36.329 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS gasps]

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:42.460 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:16:42.544 --> 00:16:45.171 position:50% align:center
Is that a werewolf?

00:16:45.255 --> 00:16:49.009 position:50% align:center
It can't be.
What is he doing here?

00:16:57.684 --> 00:17:00.437 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
C'mon! Pay attention!

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.272 position:50% align:center
So, was it you, then?

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:05.275 position:50% align:center
Are you the werewolf
who killed my father?!

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:06.818 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
This thing is an imposter!

00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:09.779 position:50% align:center
It has nothing to do with
you or my brother!

00:17:09.863 --> 00:17:10.989 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS gasps]

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:12.282 position:50% align:center
Marius!

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:22.292 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE]
Why? Why did this happen?

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:28.089 position:50% align:center
To my father,
and Leon, and Fernando.

00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:31.176 position:50% align:center
Princess, I know a lot of things
are running through your mind.

00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:33.053 position:50% align:center
Just bear with it for now.

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:34.804 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE]
You got hurt, too.

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:37.015 position:50% align:center
I assure you that I'll survive.

00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:39.934 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE]
What in the world was that?

00:17:40.018 --> 00:17:41.728 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] I don't know
why it appeared here,

00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:43.021 position:50% align:center
nor do I have any idea as to

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:45.023 position:50% align:center
why that thing
attacked your father.

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:49.569 position:50% align:center
But I do know it was a werewolf,
straight out of Magonian lore.

00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:51.571 position:50% align:center
A werewolf?

00:17:53.198 --> 00:17:54.074 position:50% align:center
[BALTHAUSER]
Maurice!

00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:55.283 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE gasps]

00:17:56.868 --> 00:17:59.662 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] Balthauser!
You're a sight for sore eyes!

00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:01.414 position:50% align:center
[BALTHAUSER]
This way, hurry.

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:09.339 position:50% align:center
[BALTHAUSER] You should be
able to get outside the castle

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:11.341 position:50% align:center
without encountering
any Camellian forces

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:14.052 position:50% align:center
or monsters if you
go through here.

00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:16.096 position:50% align:center
I'm in your debt, old man.

00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:18.264 position:50% align:center
Hopefully we're
almost in the clear.

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:19.641 position:50% align:center
Come on, we need to move!

00:18:19.724 --> 00:18:21.518 position:50% align:center
[BALTHAUSER]
Listen to me, Maurice.

00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:24.854 position:50% align:center
This day didn't come
out of the blue.

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:26.940 position:50% align:center
People have been trying
to turn the royal family

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:29.818 position:50% align:center
into their puppets for a while.

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:31.695 position:50% align:center
And though I don't know
what to make of it yet,

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:34.155 position:50% align:center
Pope Vall d'Hebron managed
to secure Prince Charlot

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:35.949 position:50% align:center
in the midst of this chaos.

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:37.867 position:50% align:center
So. The pope?

00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:40.036 position:50% align:center
[BALTHAUSER]
Hard to say what he intends.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.789 position:50% align:center
But ever since that man
assumed the papal throne,

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:46.876 position:50% align:center
His Majesty started
changing, bit by bit.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.838 position:50% align:center
He may have even helped
spark this uprising.

00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:52.966 position:50% align:center
Wait, will Charlot be all right?

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:54.092 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:55.760 position:50% align:center
[BALTHAUSER]
That's why I'll stay.

00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:57.429 position:50% align:center
Even if the pope
means him no harm,

00:18:57.512 --> 00:18:59.597 position:50% align:center
I'll protect him
from those who would.

00:18:59.681 --> 00:19:01.099 position:50% align:center
You do the same
for the princess.

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:03.184 position:50% align:center
No! I want to help my brother!

00:19:03.268 --> 00:19:04.477 position:50% align:center
You mustn't!

00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:05.979 position:50% align:center
Princess Marielle.

00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:07.856 position:50% align:center
Please leave this castle
and go with Maurice

00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:10.275 position:50% align:center
to a place beyond
the pope's reach.

00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:13.236 position:50% align:center
Keep yourself in hiding
until the time comes.

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:16.573 position:50% align:center
Charlot! Charlot!

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:22.162 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] We're going to
head for Albert's Dominion.

00:19:22.245 --> 00:19:24.664 position:50% align:center
It's the territory that
my brother governed.

00:19:24.748 --> 00:19:27.584 position:50% align:center
I believe it to be the safest
place for you, Princess.

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:30.211 position:50% align:center
[gasps] It's Fernando's land?

00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:34.716 position:50% align:center
No! There's no way
my father's dead!

00:19:36.718 --> 00:19:38.178 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
He can't be!

00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:43.767 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry, Alfred.

00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:47.562 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Marius.

00:19:49.147 --> 00:19:52.776 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Marius! Open your eyes
if you can hear me!

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:03.078 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Thank you.

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:06.414 position:50% align:center
That's good.

00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:08.208 position:50% align:center
Where's the werewolf?

00:20:09.668 --> 00:20:11.670 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
There never was any werewolf.

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:16.633 position:50% align:center
That was the monster
of Tron Cavern.

00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:18.760 position:50% align:center
Berna told me about
it a long time ago

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:20.762 position:50% align:center
because it's in
one of her books.

00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:22.597 position:50% align:center
It mentions the
mysterious spring

00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:25.475 position:50% align:center
we're standing on
at this very moment.

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:27.060 position:50% align:center
And how there's a monster
that dwells there

00:20:27.143 --> 00:20:29.020 position:50% align:center
with the power to read minds.

00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:31.773 position:50% align:center
If someone dare approach it,
the creature takes on the form

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:34.442 position:50% align:center
of what that person
despises most.

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:38.196 position:50% align:center
That makes sense.
Must've been reading my mind.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.834 position:50% align:center
[CONNY]
I'm back! I made it home!

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:52.836 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
You're okay!

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:54.713 position:50% align:center
[CONNY'S MOTHER] Oh, sweetheart,
I was worried sick!

00:20:54.796 --> 00:20:56.423 position:50% align:center
[CONNY]
I'm so sorry.

00:20:56.506 --> 00:20:59.134 position:50% align:center
I should've never said
that you needed proof.

00:20:59.217 --> 00:21:02.012 position:50% align:center
[CONNY]
Mm-mm. It doesn't matter.

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:05.265 position:50% align:center
I love stories
with happy endings.

00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:06.391 position:50% align:center
Nonnoria.

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:07.225 position:50% align:center
My lord?

00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center
And Qoo.

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:09.227 position:50% align:center
Moru?

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.229 position:50% align:center
I know that your
intentions were pure,

00:21:11.312 --> 00:21:13.940 position:50% align:center
but that place was
way too dangerous.

00:21:14.024 --> 00:21:17.569 position:50% align:center
I don't even wanna think about
what I'd do if I lost you, too.

00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:24.367 position:50% align:center
You all are the only
family I have left.

00:21:24.451 --> 00:21:28.621 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I feel the same way!

00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:33.585 position:50% align:center
We're so sorry! [cries]
We'll never do it again!

00:21:33.668 --> 00:21:37.797 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] From this day forward,
you have no choice

00:21:37.881 --> 00:21:40.633 position:50% align:center
but to live under
an assumed identity.

00:21:43.011 --> 00:21:43.845 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Marius.

00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:48.475 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS gasps]
Yes, my lord?

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:50.185 position:50% align:center
Let's go home.

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:52.812 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Okay.

00:23:32.746 --> 00:23:35.248 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] Because of all those
accusations are a load of bull!

00:23:35.331 --> 00:23:36.624 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] We're honored that
you called upon us yourself.

00:23:36.708 --> 00:23:38.001 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] What you
described sounds a lot like

00:23:38.084 --> 00:23:39.627 position:50% align:center
the undead from Magonian lore.

00:23:39.711 --> 00:23:41.671 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] No! What you're
implying is ridiculous!

00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:42.881 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
The past only happened 'cause

00:23:42.964 --> 00:23:44.424 position:50% align:center
the Church left
the village for dead.

00:23:44.507 --> 00:23:47.052 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] None of your
damn business, that's why.
