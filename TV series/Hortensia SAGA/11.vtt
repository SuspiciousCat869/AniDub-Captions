Onward men!

[HORTENSIAN SOLDIERS yell]

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:29.988 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID]
War is a chaotic sea.

00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:32.866 position:50% align:center
And the tides are
turning in our favor.

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.993 position:50% align:center
At last, your dream
is coming true.

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:37.078 position:50% align:center
You can finally
reclaim the throne.

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:39.414 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE] It's still too soon
for that kind of talk.

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:40.790 position:50% align:center
Even if we succeed in battle,

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:44.210 position:50% align:center
there's a personal mission
I have yet to carry out.

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:47.255 position:50% align:center
I must bring down the pope
and rescue my younger brother.

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:48.923 position:50% align:center
Then there's the
matter of the relic.

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:52.719 position:50% align:center
I have to ensure it doesn't fall
into anyone's hands but my own.

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:55.263 position:50% align:center
Yes, it's a personal mission,
but I would be a fool

00:00:55.347 --> 00:00:58.767 position:50% align:center
to think I could do it
all alone. Luckily...

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.019 position:50% align:center
...I have no shortage
of friends by my side.

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:04.981 position:50% align:center
Their encouragement gives me the
strength I need to persevere.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:08.401 position:50% align:center
I act on their behalf.
For everyone who wants peace.

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:11.154 position:50% align:center
Such a world shouldn't
be a fantasy. A wish.

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:13.490 position:50% align:center
It should be real.

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:15.742 position:50% align:center
And I'll be the one
to make it so!

00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:25.543 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] So, you rallied your
troops and made it this far.

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:30.298 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] I could very well
fall in battle today,

00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:32.884 position:50% align:center
though my faith in you
shall remain.

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.347 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] I'll simply count
my blessings and rejoice

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.600 position:50% align:center
in knowing I can
die without regrets.

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:20.992 position:50% align:center
Behind you!

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:26.831 position:50% align:center
[BALTHAUSER]
Hate to say it, but I think

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:28.833 position:50% align:center
you're losing
your edge, Maurice.

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:30.710 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
Old Man Balthauser!

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:32.754 position:50% align:center
I can't decide if they're
giving you a hard time

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:35.048 position:50% align:center
or if you're just
going easy on them.

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:43.682 position:50% align:center
[BALTHAUSER]
Princess Marielle!

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.266 position:50% align:center
Though I'm late to arrive,

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.144 position:50% align:center
I pray there's still a place for
me somewhere among your ranks.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.897 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I'm just glad to
see you're alive and well!

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.233 position:50% align:center
We feared your grandson
might've done you in.

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:54.567 position:50% align:center
Poppycock!

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:57.028 position:50% align:center
You realize who you're
talking to, Adelheid.

00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
It'll take more than a
cheap shot from the shadows

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:02.075 position:50% align:center
and a drop off a cliff
if they want to end me!

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:03.493 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:05.328 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You're no pushover.

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:06.913 position:50% align:center
Since you're called
"the immortal hero,"

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:08.123 position:50% align:center
they should've known.

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:10.500 position:50% align:center
Hero? He's more like
an immortal monster.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:13.336 position:50% align:center
All right. Now that you're
officially on our side,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.464 position:50% align:center
your top priority is to regain
command of Squad Two.

00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:18.758 position:50% align:center
[BALTHAUSER]
Of course, but before that.

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:23.722 position:50% align:center
[BALTHAUSER]
Forgive me, Your Highness.

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:25.557 position:50% align:center
I stayed in the capital
during your absence,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.852 position:50% align:center
but I was powerless to
stop Pope Vall d'Hebron.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.270 position:50% align:center
Nor could I keep King Charlot

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.564 position:50% align:center
out of that malicious
man's grasp.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.190 position:50% align:center
And the battle at
the Racines River

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.734 position:50% align:center
wouldn't have been
half as grueling

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:38.653 position:50% align:center
had Flegel not taken
charge of my unit.

00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:41.072 position:50% align:center
An apology just doesn't
seem like enough.

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:43.825 position:50% align:center
Balthauser, if anyone
is at fault here,

00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:46.578 position:50% align:center
it has to be my father and
his twisted way of thinking.

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:47.996 position:50% align:center
He started all this.

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:50.331 position:50% align:center
It's only fitting that
I be the end of it.

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:53.251 position:50% align:center
As princess of this land,
it's my sworn duty.

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.588 position:50% align:center
You've grown so much
since we last spoke.

00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:58.423 position:50% align:center
What a fine leader you are.

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:00.508 position:50% align:center
Let's take back
our home together.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.805 position:50% align:center
[ROY]
Will you be heading out?

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.476 position:50% align:center
[RUGIS] Yes. You stay behind and
lead the troops in my stead.

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.604 position:50% align:center
[ROY]
And if I decline? What then?

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:16.733 position:50% align:center
No one else can take my place.
You know as well as I do.

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:17.692 position:50% align:center
Hya.

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:23.239 position:50% align:center
[RUGIS]
All right, you two. Move out.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.408 position:50% align:center
[THALIA sighs]
It took you long enough.

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:28.286 position:50% align:center
This time around,
we get to kill a ton, right?

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:32.207 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] The advance force
has been divided?

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.583 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
They're planning to lure us in

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:36.419 position:50% align:center
and then pick us off
one unit at a time.

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:39.464 position:50% align:center
Such a tactic doesn't
require good leadership.

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:42.384 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
What is it?

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.928 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] Coordinating soldiers
to make sport of the enemy.

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.388 position:50% align:center
It's a strategy
I've seen perfected

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:48.640 position:50% align:center
by one person in particular.

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:51.059 position:50% align:center
You are to divert them
and create disorder!

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:53.311 position:50% align:center
Impede them by
whatever means you can!

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:56.022 position:50% align:center
The Ecclesiastical Order's
dignity's at stake!

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:58.692 position:50% align:center
But why would Captain Georg
be fighting against us?

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:00.819 position:50% align:center
I thought the two of
you go way back.

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:03.738 position:50% align:center
Friendship has nothing
to do with one's convictions.

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:05.448 position:50% align:center
Just leave Georg to me.

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:07.826 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Hold on. Are you sure?

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:11.204 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] I know how that man
operates better than anybody.

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:14.124 position:50% align:center
So, yes. I'm very sure.

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:19.671 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] The rebels were
successful in breaking through

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:20.964 position:50% align:center
the main gate and are now

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:24.426 position:50% align:center
gradually filtering
into the city streets.

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.553 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON] Perhaps if our
knights had a bit more nerve,

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:28.680 position:50% align:center
this report wouldn't be
so underwhelming.

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:31.141 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] The good news is
Captain Georg is in command,

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:33.435 position:50% align:center
but I still think it's
only a matter of time.

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:36.021 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid that is unacceptable.

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:38.273 position:50% align:center
The ritual has
yet to be completed.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:42.527 position:50% align:center
Didier, if you're not busy,
lend them a hand.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.696 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
As you wish, Your Holiness.

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:51.327 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:55.540 position:50% align:center
We'll go offer support
to the isolated men!

00:06:55.623 --> 00:06:56.666 position:50% align:center
Better be quick then!

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.376 position:50% align:center
You heard him,
Deflotte! Let's go!

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.794 position:50% align:center
Right behind you!

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:02.255 position:50% align:center
[ECCLESIASTICAL KNIGHT 11E]
Reinforcements?

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.594 position:50% align:center

[HORTENSIAN SOLDIERS yell]

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.348 position:50% align:center

to assist the advance force.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:12.223 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER SOLDIERS]
Yes, ma'am!

00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:13.516 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE]
Wait a moment!

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.893 position:50% align:center
Princess, I must hurry.

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:16.770 position:50% align:center
Please allow me
to accompany you!

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:18.271 position:50% align:center
What? Your Highness.

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:20.607 position:50% align:center
You'll be putting yourself
in danger if you come.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.235 position:50% align:center
I realize that. But I can't
shake this bad feeling.

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:27.489 position:50% align:center
[HORTENSIAN SOLDIERS yelling]

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:32.327 position:50% align:center
[PALADIN 11A] That looks like
the entire Olivier army!

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.162 position:50% align:center
Send word to pull
the front line back!

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:36.456 position:50% align:center
Bring the advance guard
within the castle walls!

[HORTENSIAN SOLDIERS yell]

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:41.044 position:50% align:center

To preserve the light!

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:42.337 position:50% align:center
[PALADIN 11C]
In the name of the pope!

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.797 position:50% align:center
Think, men!

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.758 position:50% align:center
What we need to do is band
together and hold the line!

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.720 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] I was wondering
when I'd see you.

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.263 position:50% align:center
Since the battle's all but won,

00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:55.183 position:50% align:center
what you should wonder about
are your terms of surrender!

00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:57.394 position:50% align:center
There's no hope for you now!

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:58.687 position:50% align:center
[GEORG]
Be that as it may,

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.356 position:50% align:center
I refuse to abandon
my post or my duty.

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:03.149 position:50% align:center
You will not
bring down the pope.

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:05.902 position:50% align:center
For the ideals of
the Orthodox Church!

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:08.321 position:50% align:center
I don't buy that
for a second, Georg.

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:11.241 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
I'm sure you have your reasons

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:12.909 position:50% align:center
for staying faithful
to the church,

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:16.037 position:50% align:center
but I don't believe you actually
support their principles.

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:20.208 position:50% align:center
I see. Guess you'll have to
force the truth out of me.

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:22.836 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Everyone all right?

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.963 position:50% align:center
Yes, though till you arrived,
I thought we were done for.

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:27.674 position:50% align:center
Not today. Now let's go
join up with the main force.

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:28.550 position:50% align:center
[ROYAL KNIGHTS]
Sir!

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:30.385 position:50% align:center

Alfred!

[ALFRED]
What're you doing here?

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:32.971 position:50% align:center
Be careful!

Aw, for cripes' sake!

None of you are getting away.

[ADELHEID]
Oh, no you don't!

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:55.827 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
You certainly are persistent.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.163 position:50% align:center
It's the day of reckoning
for you and your church!

00:08:58.246 --> 00:08:59.664 position:50% align:center
So, prepare!

00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:08.381 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE]
Are you injured?

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:12.552 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] I'll survive. More
importantly, why did you come?

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:15.096 position:50% align:center
I needed to be here.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.058 position:50% align:center
I just sense something bad
is going to happen to you.

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:20.810 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Sorry to interrupt!

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:22.854 position:50% align:center
But Adelheid could
use some support!

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:23.938 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED, MARIELLE gasp]

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:25.940 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE]
Wait!

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.319 position:50% align:center
Black Knight Didier.

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:30.653 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
Hm?

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:33.782 position:50% align:center
Please, sir. I ask you
to lay your weapons down.

00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:35.909 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
Right in the midst of combat?

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:37.660 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE] That's the thing
I don't understand.

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:39.537 position:50% align:center
Why are you fighting us?

00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:41.206 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] I would've thought
that was obvious,

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:43.083 position:50% align:center
but I'm an
Ecclesiastical Knight.

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.668 position:50% align:center
I adhere to the ideals of

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:46.753 position:50% align:center
the Orthodox Church
and defend its pope,

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:49.506 position:50% align:center
whom you happen to be
assaulting at the present time.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:52.425 position:50% align:center
And you're telling me
that's how you really feel?

00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:55.762 position:50% align:center
Princess. You're
speaking to a traitor

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:57.472 position:50% align:center
who helped to
overthrow the kingdom.

00:09:57.555 --> 00:09:59.557 position:50% align:center
Reasoning with him is pointless.

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:02.602 position:50% align:center
Even if you weren't
an enemy of Hortensia,

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:04.187 position:50% align:center
you're still an
enemy of Adelheid,

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.897 position:50% align:center
which makes you as good as dead!

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.942 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] You can either stand
down by choice or by force!

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:17.200 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON] Such a
tremendous flow of emotions.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:21.663 position:50% align:center
The people's hatred,
their fear, and bloodlust.

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:24.582 position:50% align:center
It's all combining
into one and shall serve

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:27.460 position:50% align:center
as the perfect energy
source for me.

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:29.295 position:50% align:center
Not much longer.

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:33.174 position:50% align:center
The relic's power
shall soon be mine!

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:36.594 position:50% align:center
[cackles]

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:40.348 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] I thought you three
were going to give me a fight.

00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:42.350 position:50% align:center
You assumed you'd have
strength in numbers,

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:45.020 position:50% align:center
but quantity
can't match quality.

00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:47.105 position:50% align:center
He's so strong.

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:49.274 position:50% align:center
We might've bitten off
more than we can chew.

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:51.818 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
I don't care! I won't give up!

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:54.446 position:50% align:center
Even if it's futile, I'll see
this fight through to the end!

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:56.406 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
At least you know it's futile.

00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:03.538 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
Time to finish this.

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:09.002 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
A fatal mistake.

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:12.839 position:50% align:center
Your skills are laughable
in comparison to mine.

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:14.132 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:27.979 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER gasps]

00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:42.952 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
Yes, that's right.

00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:45.663 position:50% align:center
I nearly forgot that
you're a Bearer.

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:48.792 position:50% align:center
What?

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:52.796 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] For now,
I shall take my leave.

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:00.303 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] You just beat
a literal one-man army!

00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:01.846 position:50% align:center
I can't believe it!

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
He did more than
beat him, Deflotte.

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:06.309 position:50% align:center
Nobody could survive
a wound like that.

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:09.479 position:50% align:center
What was that light?
What'd you do?

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:24.077 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] I think it's fair
to say I've forced your hand.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.870 position:50% align:center
So, after all was said and done,

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:28.081 position:50% align:center
what made you choose
to side with the pope?

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.713 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] Some time ago, Vall
d'Hebron and I studied together

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:39.092 position:50% align:center
as fellow men of the cloth and
were both eventually ordained.

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:41.845 position:50% align:center
His sanctity was truly
something to behold,

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
and people became
absolutely riveted by it.

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:46.307 position:50% align:center
I, too, was convinced
he would one day be

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:50.437 position:50% align:center
the man who led the
Hortensian Orthodox Church.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.480 position:50% align:center
The more time I spent
around him, though,

00:12:52.564 --> 00:12:56.985 position:50% align:center
the more things I saw.
His true nature bled through.

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:01.322 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] If he didn't see
eye-to-eye with someone,

00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:04.075 position:50% align:center
Vall d'Hebron would purge
them one way or another.

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:05.535 position:50% align:center
They were either slain or set up

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:07.746 position:50% align:center
and driven out of the
church on his orders.

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:09.914 position:50% align:center
I witnessed it myself.

00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:11.374 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] Now your motives
for protecting him

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:13.668 position:50% align:center
are more confusing than ever.

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:18.298 position:50% align:center
There are very few people who're
aware of his crooked ways.

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:20.759 position:50% align:center
His naïve yet devout
disciples mean well

00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:23.094 position:50% align:center
but are blind
to his darker side.

00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:24.179 position:50% align:center
And I could not bring myself

00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:26.806 position:50% align:center
to desert such
pure-hearted souls.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.850 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] Protecting a monster
like that for the sake of

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:30.977 position:50% align:center
his followers
is quite the burden.

00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:32.604 position:50% align:center
You jackass.

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:36.733 position:50% align:center
[GEORG]
Sorry, Maurice. I truly am.

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:47.494 position:50% align:center
Ah, magnificent.

00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:51.623 position:50% align:center
How many can proclaim they've
achieved divinity itself?

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:55.293 position:50% align:center
And now that I finally
have this power.

00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:58.963 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON]
Don't leave me, Mother. Please!

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:02.133 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER] Alexis. There's
something you need to know.

00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:05.845 position:50% align:center
You're the king's son.
His blood flows within you.

00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:07.847 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON]
Wh-What?

00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:09.683 position:50% align:center
It didn't last all that long,

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:13.061 position:50% align:center
but there was a point
when I lived by his side.

00:14:13.144 --> 00:14:17.065 position:50% align:center
I know this must be quite a
shock. I should've told you.

00:14:17.148 --> 00:14:21.069 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for that, and for not
giving you a happy life.

00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:25.657 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON] You had nothing
to apologize for, Mother.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.992 position:50% align:center
No, I blame the man
who used you

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:31.287 position:50% align:center
and tossed you aside the moment
you were inconvenient.

00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:33.665 position:50% align:center
I swear I'll make him pay.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:36.418 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON]
And pay he has.

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:38.712 position:50% align:center
All that's left is to finish
exacting my revenge

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:40.380 position:50% align:center
on the royal family
and bring about

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:42.340 position:50% align:center
true peace for the kingdom.

00:14:42.424 --> 00:14:44.342 position:50% align:center
Good things come
to those who wait,

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:47.721 position:50% align:center
and I've waited
for this a long time.

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:54.811 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON cackles]

00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:00.608 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE] Have you petitioned
them to surrender, Adelheid?

00:15:00.692 --> 00:15:01.985 position:50% align:center
As soon as I could,
Your Highness,

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:03.403 position:50% align:center
but no one's replied as of yet.

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:05.363 position:50% align:center
Securing the castle
and defeating the pope

00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:06.906 position:50% align:center
are the only measures
that might make his

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:09.826 position:50% align:center
loyal believers
come to see reason.

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:12.662 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
This unusual attraction that

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:15.206 position:50% align:center
Pope Vall d'Hebron possesses.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.667 position:50% align:center
Do you think some other power
could be at work here?

00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:19.210 position:50% align:center
Like Magonian magic?

00:15:19.294 --> 00:15:20.086 position:50% align:center
What?

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.588 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
It's possible.

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:23.965 position:50% align:center
I know we're on
opposing sides, but still.

00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:26.843 position:50% align:center
Those knights are
Hortensian, same as us.

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.637 position:50% align:center
I do not want this war
to claim any more lives.

00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:32.599 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE] Tell our forces to
refrain from engaging the enemy

00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:35.226 position:50% align:center
unless absolutely necessary.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.187 position:50% align:center
We, on the other hand,
will infiltrate the castle

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.814 position:50% align:center
with a small team and
subdue the pope ourselves.

00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:42.859 position:50% align:center
How, may I ask,
do you plan to get in?

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:44.652 position:50% align:center
[BALTHAUSER]
Through an underground tunnel.

00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:46.780 position:50% align:center
[gasps] The escape route.

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:49.074 position:50% align:center
Though I might not
agree with this decision,

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:50.408 position:50% align:center
that determined
gleam in your eye

00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:52.452 position:50% align:center
is the kind that
can't be dissuaded.

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:54.537 position:50% align:center
So, I won't try to stop you.

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:56.831 position:50% align:center
I'll take over here
while you're gone.

00:15:56.915 --> 00:15:59.834 position:50% align:center
No matter what transpires,
keep the princess safe.

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:02.295 position:50% align:center
Is that clear?

00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:03.755 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.761 position:50% align:center
That should do it!
You're good to go!

00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:11.638 position:50% align:center
All thanks to your handiwork.

00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:14.349 position:50% align:center
Don't push yourself
too hard, okay?

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:16.059 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Nonnoria.

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:18.228 position:50% align:center
Alfred, you're actually here!

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:20.271 position:50% align:center
You're helping out with
the medical corps, too?

00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:21.272 position:50% align:center
Lucky for us.

00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:22.482 position:50% align:center
Patching my comrades up,

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:25.568 position:50% align:center
shooting enemies down,
I can do it all!

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:28.488 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
You're hurt.

00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:30.865 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's just a scratch!
They barely broke the skin!

00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:31.991 position:50% align:center
I'm fine! Honest!

00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:35.286 position:50% align:center
Calm down.
Let me take a look. Please?

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:40.625 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
A group of us are planning to

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:42.085 position:50% align:center
sneak into the castle.

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:45.422 position:50% align:center
It'll be dangerous,
and you're already injured, so.

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:48.550 position:50% align:center
I'd prefer you stayed here.

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:49.884 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA]
All right.

00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:54.139 position:50% align:center
There. Well, I'm off.

00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:58.309 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA]
Uh, wait! Before you go!

00:16:58.393 --> 00:17:02.147 position:50% align:center
My lord. Promise me
something first!

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.442 position:50% align:center
I want you to swear that you're
going to return safe and sound.

00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:10.822 position:50% align:center
I want your word
that you'll come back to me.

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:19.581 position:50% align:center
I promise I will.

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:28.840 position:50% align:center
[RUGIS] Stop. There's
no need to kill them.

00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:31.217 position:50% align:center
Aww. But I really wanted to!

00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:32.677 position:50% align:center
Why shouldn't we?

00:17:32.761 --> 00:17:35.638 position:50% align:center
We came here for
the relic, not their blood.

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:39.142 position:50% align:center
[RUGIS] You two go check
the underground temple.

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:41.686 position:50% align:center
[THALIA] Where will you be
while we're doing that?

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.104 position:50% align:center
[RUGIS]
The castle.

00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:47.275 position:50% align:center
[ELVA] Hey, Thalia.
Suppose we do find the relic.

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:49.235 position:50% align:center
Are we gonna
hand it over to Rugis?

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:51.321 position:50% align:center
Oh, please.
Of course we're not.

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:54.199 position:50% align:center
Why would we give it to him when
the master wants it as well?

00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:56.868 position:50% align:center
That's true. Very good point.

00:17:56.951 --> 00:18:00.121 position:50% align:center
Ah! But I'd rather give it to
Theresia before anyone!

00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:01.581 position:50% align:center
[THALIA]
Same here.

00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:04.125 position:50% align:center
Let's hurry up and find it
so we can go play with her.

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:09.381 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID] I never knew
there was a passageway

00:18:09.464 --> 00:18:11.549 position:50% align:center
such as this beneath the castle.

00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:13.385 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't be much of
a secret escape route

00:18:13.468 --> 00:18:15.845 position:50% align:center
if the royal family
told everybody.

00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:20.684 position:50% align:center
You're positive
there's not a bridge

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:22.143 position:50% align:center
or something farther down?

00:18:22.227 --> 00:18:24.521 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE] I'm sorry, but we
don't have time to look.

00:18:24.604 --> 00:18:26.106 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE sighs]

00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:31.069 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE gasps]

00:18:31.152 --> 00:18:32.487 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Easy does it.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.240 position:50% align:center
Whoa, weird. It felt like
something just grabbed me.

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:36.700 position:50% align:center
Hey, none of that now.

00:18:36.783 --> 00:18:39.244 position:50% align:center
This mission's hard enough
without you getting spooked.

00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:40.870 position:50% align:center
Um, guys?

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:47.711 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Not here, too.

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:53.091 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] Why do I see
these things everywhere I go?

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:58.680 position:50% align:center
This is no time
to panic, Deflotte!

00:18:58.763 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:04.227 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the reminder, Marius!

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.311 position:50% align:center
Get out of there!

00:19:05.395 --> 00:19:06.938 position:50% align:center
Can't strike 'em down
if I do that!

00:19:07.022 --> 00:19:08.440 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
There're too many of them!

00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:10.442 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] I have a score to
settle with these monsters!

00:19:10.525 --> 00:19:12.485 position:50% align:center
So, you all go on without me!

00:19:12.569 --> 00:19:14.195 position:50% align:center
There's a gut-wrenching
fear that grips me

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:16.656 position:50% align:center
every time I encounter
these hideous things.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.700 position:50% align:center
And if I don't shake it,
I'll keep searching for

00:19:18.783 --> 00:19:20.952 position:50% align:center
the faces of the people
from Petale Village!

00:19:21.036 --> 00:19:23.538 position:50% align:center
Acting recklessly
won't solve anything!

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:25.540 position:50% align:center
I already said I don't want
anyone else to die,

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:26.624 position:50% align:center
and that includes you!

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:27.959 position:50% align:center
Listen to me.

00:19:28.043 --> 00:19:30.170 position:50% align:center
Do you know how
you can tell a man's worth?

00:19:30.253 --> 00:19:33.840 position:50% align:center
Count how many beautiful women
cry over him after he dies.

00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:35.383 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:35.467 --> 00:19:37.719 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] If I end up
biting the big one here,

00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:39.220 position:50% align:center
I don't mind.

00:19:39.304 --> 00:19:41.348 position:50% align:center
Because a princess of a whole
kingdom would cry for me.

00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:43.308 position:50% align:center
And if that doesn't
add value to my life,

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:45.018 position:50% align:center
I don't know what does.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.981 position:50% align:center
Godspeed, then.

00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:52.901 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare
make the princess grieve.

00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:56.738 position:50% align:center
That was never the plan.
I do have one question, though.

00:19:57.822 --> 00:19:59.908 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Say I slip up and die after all.

00:19:59.991 --> 00:20:01.659 position:50% align:center
Would you cry for me?

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:04.704 position:50% align:center
How 'bout I make you deal?

00:20:04.788 --> 00:20:07.040 position:50% align:center
Find me later and I'll tell you.

00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:11.336 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
In that case...

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:14.964 position:50% align:center
I wanna know her answer,
so let's make this snappy.

00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:17.384 position:50% align:center
You undead should be
dead-dead anyway!

00:20:17.467 --> 00:20:20.470 position:50% align:center
Give me everything
you've got and then some!

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:31.356 position:50% align:center
How strange.

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:33.858 position:50% align:center
There isn't a single
guard in sight.

00:20:33.942 --> 00:20:35.694 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] It's likely they were
sent out into the streets

00:20:35.777 --> 00:20:37.362 position:50% align:center
when we attacked earlier.

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:38.780 position:50% align:center
Now's our chance.

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:41.199 position:50% align:center
Let's sneak into the throne room
before we're spotted.

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:44.285 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:20:44.369 --> 00:20:47.163 position:50% align:center
Something is approaching.
I'll handle it.

00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:48.331 position:50% align:center
What?

00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:49.374 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID]
This shouldn't take long.

00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:50.875 position:50% align:center
No, wait! Let's stay together.

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:52.460 position:50% align:center
Come on. We should keep going.

00:20:52.544 --> 00:20:53.294 position:50% align:center
Alfred.

00:20:53.378 --> 00:20:55.505 position:50% align:center
We don't have time to spare.

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:57.799 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] Adelheid can
take care of herself.

00:21:00.343 --> 00:21:02.262 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE]
Fine. Let's hurry.

00:21:07.017 --> 00:21:10.020 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID] I heard someone
calling me. But who?

00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:13.023 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID]
Come! Show yourself!

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:19.070 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE] The throne room
is just up ahead.

00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:20.405 position:50% align:center
Wait a moment!

00:21:26.036 --> 00:21:27.245 position:50% align:center
Someone's here.

00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:29.372 position:50% align:center
Maybe an ambush.

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:33.001 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE] No. It looks like
it's only one person.

00:21:33.084 --> 00:21:34.252 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.383 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
It can't be. How?

00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:45.972 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID]
No way. I don't believe it.

00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:48.725 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID]
Father?

00:21:54.564 --> 00:21:55.982 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Father.

00:23:33.663 --> 00:23:35.957 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID] How are you here?
I buried you myself.

00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:37.334 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Which means
this war is almost over.

00:23:37.417 --> 00:23:39.586 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE] I wish I had
better words, but thank you.

00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:40.670 position:50% align:center
For all you've done.

00:23:40.754 --> 00:23:41.671 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON]
I'll put the detestable

00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:43.048 position:50% align:center
Hortensia family to shame.

00:23:43.131 --> 00:23:46.301 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Everything I love,
I'll protect it all!
