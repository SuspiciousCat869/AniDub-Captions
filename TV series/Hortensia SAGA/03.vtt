[KNIGHT 3A]
Hey! You with the spear! Halt!

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:19.894 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE sighs]
Not again.

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:21.813 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 3A]
You're Deflotte Danois.

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:23.356 position:50% align:center
The wanted criminal suspected of

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.900 position:50% align:center
larceny, assault,
and arson in Tours!

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:27.402 position:50% align:center
That's you, right?

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:29.404 position:50% align:center
Just shut up, will ya?

00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:33.324 position:50% align:center
Because all those accusations
are a load of bull!

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:34.492 position:50% align:center
He had a smoke bomb?

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.327 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Bye, now!

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:37.162 position:50% align:center
Damn him!

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:38.580 position:50% align:center
Where did he go?

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:40.165 position:50% align:center
We can't let that fiend escape!

00:00:40.248 --> 00:00:41.791 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 3A]
Right!

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.460 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] You'd have
better luck finding things

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:45.503 position:50% align:center
if you opened your eyes
every once in a while.

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:49.799 position:50% align:center
What? Five measly
gold coins for my arrest?

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:53.428 position:50% align:center
Well, at least
the picture's not half bad.

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:27.856 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Following
Duke Rugis's rebellion,

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.026 position:50% align:center
Prince Charlot ascended
to the Hortensian throne,

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.945 position:50% align:center
and Pope Vall d'Hebron
became his guardian,

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:35.530 position:50% align:center
advising the
young king throughout

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:38.074 position:50% align:center
the early years of his rule.

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.869 position:50% align:center
As a result, the Orthodox
Church of Hortensia

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:42.996 position:50% align:center
assumed control of the land,

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.040 position:50% align:center
and command of the
royal knights was placed

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:48.793 position:50% align:center
under the supervision of
the Ecclesiastical Order.

00:02:54.716 --> 00:02:56.885 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] I haven't been to
the capital in a long time.

00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:58.386 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Yeah.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.681 position:50% align:center
Well, looks like most everything
has recovered since then.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.267 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:08.355 position:50% align:center
Oh, I suppose my mind's still
wrapped up around Marius.

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.482 position:50% align:center
You're going to the capital?

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:12.609 position:50% align:center
There's obviously
something strange here!

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:15.070 position:50% align:center
Don't you think you're
overreacting a little bit?

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:16.363 position:50% align:center
This is a summons
from the captain

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:18.740 position:50% align:center
of the Ecclesiastical
Order himself.

00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:21.117 position:50% align:center
The Ecclesiastical Order
is precisely the reason

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.328 position:50% align:center
I'm worried about
you going, Alfred!

00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:24.662 position:50% align:center
What if they get you
thrown in jail?

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:26.915 position:50% align:center
Well, they don't have
any grounds to arrest him.

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:28.500 position:50% align:center
Have to break the law for that.

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:30.001 position:50% align:center
But still.

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:33.088 position:50% align:center
Marius, I wasn't always
the Lord of Albert.

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
I used to be a knight.

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:40.136 position:50% align:center
I'm well aware.
But even so, I still--

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.805 position:50% align:center
Marius.

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:47.936 position:50% align:center
I'm sure there's a good
reason he feels that way.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.271 position:50% align:center
So, keep an open mind
with him, eh?

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:51.564 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:57.445 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
It is strange.

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:00.198 position:50% align:center
I don't often get a call-up
notice that's practically blank.

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:02.659 position:50% align:center
What was Georg thinking
when he sent this?

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:05.036 position:50% align:center
You and Captain Georg
are acquaintances, right?

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.871 position:50% align:center
I know him from my time
in the royal order

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:08.832 position:50% align:center
way back in the day,

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.710 position:50% align:center
and he's someone
I'd trust with my life.

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:16.214 position:50% align:center
[GEORG]
I apologize for the wait.

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:22.762 position:50% align:center
Especially since I requested
you both report directly to me.

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:26.349 position:50% align:center
It's fine. We're honored that
you called upon us yourself.

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:27.976 position:50% align:center
It's good to see you again.

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.103 position:50% align:center
I feel it's been
far too long, Captain.

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:33.898 position:50% align:center
I agree. Your inauguration
seems like ages ago.

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:35.275 position:50% align:center
But I'll never forget
the day I got to

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:38.069 position:50% align:center
stand shoulder-to-shoulder
with Fernando's son.

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:40.655 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] I think that's enough
with the pleasantries.

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:44.743 position:50% align:center
Come on. You didn't summon us
to reminisce, right?

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:45.994 position:50% align:center
We're here because
there's something

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:48.747 position:50% align:center
you don't want others to know.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.750 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] You're as perceptive
as ever, Maurice.

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:54.669 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] Do you recall
the petridermic plague

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:57.839 position:50% align:center
that erupted in Petale
Village two years ago?

00:04:57.922 --> 00:05:00.842 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Yes. The disease
that made skin hard and gray,

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:02.927 position:50% align:center
essentially turning
victims to stone.

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.054 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
They gathered physicians from

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:05.221 position:50% align:center
every corner of the kingdom,

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.599 position:50% align:center
but they couldn't find
a way to treat it,

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.267 position:50% align:center
and the Orthodox Church
had no choice

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:11.436 position:50% align:center
but to quarantine
the whole village.

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:13.480 position:50% align:center
I hear that it's a
ghost town and nobody is

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:16.191 position:50% align:center
allowed to go in or
out to this very day.

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:17.859 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] I want you to
conduct an off-the-books

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:20.904 position:50% align:center
investigation into that village.

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:22.364 position:50% align:center
There's been more than
a fair share of

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:24.783 position:50% align:center
monster sightings
in that area recently,

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:28.036 position:50% align:center
all of which claim the
creatures resemble humans.

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:30.747 position:50% align:center
According to the reports
that we received,

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.707 position:50% align:center
people once thought
to be dead are rising

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:34.584 position:50% align:center
and walking among us.

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:35.960 position:50% align:center
Walking corpses?

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:37.671 position:50% align:center
What you described
sounds a lot like

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:39.714 position:50% align:center
the undead from Magonian lore.

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:42.300 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] I don't know if this is
connected with that plague,

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:44.260 position:50% align:center
but we must prevent
the name of Petale Village

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:47.597 position:50% align:center
from causing a new wave of
terror to sweep the kingdom.

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.933 position:50% align:center
But, sir. I don't get it.

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:53.478 position:50% align:center
Why not dispatch your
own men to handle this?

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:54.521 position:50% align:center
Uh--

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.274 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] Who cares!
What matters is he's asking us!

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:01.194 position:50% align:center
So, let's show him
what we've got!

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:02.862 position:50% align:center
Very well then, Captain.

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:05.907 position:50% align:center
And don't worry, I promise
we'll be discreet.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.283 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:11.454 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] How far back you guys
go is irrelevant to me.

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.748 position:50% align:center
This investigation
involves the church!

00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:15.458 position:50% align:center
I sympathize with him.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.294 position:50% align:center
He wants to try to prevent
the past from repeating itself.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:19.629 position:50% align:center
The past only happened 'cause

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:21.589 position:50% align:center
the church left
the village for dead.

00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:22.882 position:50% align:center
And I'm sure you've
heard tales about

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:24.801 position:50% align:center
the witch involved
in this whole mishap.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:27.679 position:50% align:center
There was a witch involved
in all this, moru?

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:30.223 position:50% align:center
They say the plague
was a curse invoked by

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
a witch who wanted
to destroy the land.

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.353 position:50% align:center
It was decreed Petale
Village be sealed off

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:37.397 position:50% align:center
from the rest of the kingdom
for fear the "curse"

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.608 position:50% align:center
might engulf the
entirety of Hortensia.

00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:42.485 position:50% align:center
As a means to calm
the panicked people,

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.696 position:50% align:center
the Orthodox Church
pledged to find and kill

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:47.198 position:50% align:center
the witch responsible
for the outbreak.

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:51.453 position:50% align:center
But the lockdown they placed
on Petale was never lifted.

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:55.248 position:50% align:center
Because their witch hunt was
more like a wild-goose chase.

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:59.461 position:50% align:center
So, does this witch
even really exist?

00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:01.004 position:50% align:center
They have nothing to show
for their search

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.464 position:50% align:center
after two whole years!

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.007 position:50% align:center
Did they make that
whole story up just to

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.010 position:50% align:center
prey on people's fear
and manipulate them?

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:08.136 position:50% align:center
Careful now.

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:11.598 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS gasps]
I'm sorry.

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:12.724 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
I get that you don't have

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.934 position:50% align:center
a very high opinion
of the church.

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:17.020 position:50% align:center
You can't spout off
like that, though.

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.314 position:50% align:center
You're more liable to
get arrested that way.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:23.485 position:50% align:center
That's very true.
I'll mind my tongue.

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:26.696 position:50% align:center
[QOO]
Moru...

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:34.162 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] There's definitely
an ambience about the place.

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:35.830 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Someone broke through the fence.

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:37.957 position:50% align:center
Or, more than likely, something.

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:40.960 position:50% align:center
So then, you think it's
the work of the "undead"?

00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:44.881 position:50% align:center
I really hope this is effective.

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:45.882 position:50% align:center
Those flowers.

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:47.592 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Oh! They're, um...

00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:48.843 position:50% align:center
Sure takes me back.

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:50.345 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:52.597 position:50% align:center
They were mentioned a few times
in some of Berna's books,

00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:54.557 position:50% align:center
so Nonnoria used to pick them.

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:56.476 position:50% align:center
Do you know why, though?

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:59.479 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA] This little beauty
is no ordinary flower!

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:01.314 position:50% align:center
It can drive away the undead!

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:03.942 position:50% align:center
Geh-- Whoa! Just like that?

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:05.318 position:50% align:center
What's it called, moru?

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:08.029 position:50% align:center
Good question!
They're Requiem flowers!

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:11.700 position:50% align:center
Simply hold some up, then recite
the incantation like so!

00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:13.827 position:50% align:center
"Hinfort, hinfort"...

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.203 position:50% align:center
Hold on! The heck's a "hinfort"?

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:16.913 position:50% align:center
Nonnoria!

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:19.207 position:50% align:center
It's a fabled passage
primarily meant to

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.167 position:50% align:center
soothe the souls of
the dearly departed.

00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:22.794 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's not like
I'm afraid of

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:25.088 position:50% align:center
the undead or anything,
I was just curious!

Stop! Stay back!

There's someone here!

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:36.474 position:50% align:center
[ZOMBIES groaning]

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:39.894 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
What the hell's going on?

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:50.989 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:56.036 position:50% align:center
[QOO]
Over there, moru!

00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:57.996 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE yells]

00:08:58.079 --> 00:08:59.622 position:50% align:center
Whoa.

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:00.498 position:50% align:center
Damn.

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:01.875 position:50% align:center
So, are these things the undead?

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.753 position:50% align:center
Hurry up!
Recite the incantation!

00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:07.714 position:50% align:center
Right. I hope it works.

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:10.508 position:50% align:center
Hinfort, hinfort.

00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:13.511 position:50% align:center
Bevor das Lied endet.

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:14.846 position:50% align:center
What in the?

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:19.309 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Bevor de Duft der Blume vergeht!

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:20.185 position:50% align:center
They're paralyzed!

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:22.312 position:50% align:center
You really did it, moru!

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:23.605 position:50% align:center
[ZOMBIES groaning]

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:24.981 position:50% align:center
You didn't do a thing, moru!

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:27.609 position:50% align:center
Why're they all coming this way?

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:29.152 position:50% align:center
[QOO, MARIUS scream]

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:35.825 position:50% align:center
Hold up! Or not.

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:41.915 position:50% align:center
Whoa.

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:46.920 position:50% align:center
Alfred sure is something.

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:49.964 position:50% align:center
He slayed them all
practically singlehandedly.

00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:01.476 position:50% align:center
Do you know what
happened here?

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:03.436 position:50% align:center
Haven't got a clue in the world.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.605 position:50% align:center
The real question is
why are you here?

00:10:05.689 --> 00:10:08.191 position:50% align:center
We came 'cause the Orthodox Ch--

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
You just say the
Orthodox Church?

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:14.197 position:50% align:center
Take it easy.
I'm a pleasant old man,

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.825 position:50% align:center
but I'm also formerly
of the royal knights.

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:18.660 position:50% align:center
Same goes for my nephew.

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:20.912 position:50% align:center
We won't be pushovers
if you fight us.

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:22.414 position:50% align:center
You were royal knights?

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:24.457 position:50% align:center
So, then the church
did send out their dogs!

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:28.294 position:50% align:center
We came to this place to slay
the undead by circumstance.

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:30.463 position:50% align:center
I'm Alfred of Albert.

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:32.549 position:50% align:center
Why did you violate the
mandate prohibiting people

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:34.759 position:50% align:center
from coming and going
to this village?

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:37.345 position:50% align:center
None of your damn
business, that's why.

00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:38.596 position:50% align:center
And you with the flowers!

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.765 position:50% align:center
What were you
trying to do anyway?

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:42.934 position:50% align:center
It's from Magonian lore.

00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50% align:center
Requiem flowers are
said to ward off the undead.

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:47.731 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:49.733 position:50% align:center
Well, I dunno what
"circumstance"

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:52.360 position:50% align:center
brought you to
Petale for monsters...

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:56.072 position:50% align:center
...but keep outta my way.

00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:59.200 position:50% align:center
Hang on.

00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:04.164 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
I wonder what his deal is.

00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:15.967 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] Amazing how much
things fall apart when

00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:18.345 position:50% align:center
people aren't around
to maintain them.

00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:20.096 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] It's not that
they weren't around.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.307 position:50% align:center
The plague prevented
its victims from moving,

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.018 position:50% align:center
so it's only natural the place
would be a little rundown.

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:27.896 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] The entire town
feels neglected, though.

00:11:27.979 --> 00:11:29.147 position:50% align:center
You'd think there'd
be a few people

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.484 position:50% align:center
left to tend to the sick
or bury the deceased.

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:35.195 position:50% align:center
Right? Even if most of
them are dead and buried,

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:37.197 position:50% align:center
there should be
at least one survivor.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.909 position:50% align:center
Because we haven't found
a single body as of yet.

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:42.494 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:47.791 position:50% align:center
The village cemetery should be
our next stop, I think.

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:51.461 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
That's probably by the church.

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:54.089 position:50% align:center
[QOO]
Marius, what's wrong, moru?

00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:55.465 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] You know how
we were talking about

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:56.800 position:50% align:center
the lack of bodies?

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:57.926 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
Yeah?

00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:59.177 position:50% align:center
You don't think it's
because the undead

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.138 position:50% align:center
we fought earlier were
the villagers, do you?

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:04.849 position:50% align:center
Has that prospect been
eating at you all this time?

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:06.226 position:50% align:center
Kind of.

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:09.938 position:50% align:center
Wait. The monsters here
were just like-- That's it.

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:11.106 position:50% align:center
What's it?

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.026 position:50% align:center
The way he acted. I get it now.

00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:20.824 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] That man.
He's most likely from Petale.

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:23.660 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
What? He can't be!

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:28.581 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
This church.

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:31.292 position:50% align:center
It really is a fine work
of architecture.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:35.255 position:50% align:center
Had a fine priest, too.

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:37.382 position:50% align:center
Held his services
all the damn time.

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:40.510 position:50% align:center
I thought you only just arrived,
but this is where you're from?

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:44.389 position:50% align:center
It was my hometown,
but I left it a long time ago.

00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:45.974 position:50% align:center
Didn't stop my ears
from perking up

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:48.226 position:50% align:center
when I heard about the stories.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.272 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
I didn't wanna forsake Petale

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:54.649 position:50% align:center
like the rest of
the kingdom did.

00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:56.026 position:50% align:center
So, I thought the
least I could do was

00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:58.278 position:50% align:center
stop by and leave some flowers.

00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:01.614 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] You came back to
mourn the other villagers?

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:03.742 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] That was my plan,
but there's no sign

00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:07.203 position:50% align:center
of them being buried.
What happened here?

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.039 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
Just curious, but did you see

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.374 position:50% align:center
any familiar faces
among the undead?

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:14.044 position:50% align:center
No! What you're
implying is ridiculous!

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:17.297 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE laughs]
You make a very good point.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.632 position:50% align:center
Try talking some sense, old man.

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:22.010 position:50% align:center
There was an instance
about four years ago

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:25.430 position:50% align:center
where I witnessed how monsters
came to be in our kingdom.

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:27.390 position:50% align:center
They travel here
from some other dimension

00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:29.893 position:50% align:center
through the use
of magic circles.

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:32.437 position:50% align:center
I've seen and heard
a lot of things in my life,

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.981 position:50% align:center
but people originally
from this world

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:37.525 position:50% align:center
turning into monsters
isn't one of them.

00:13:37.609 --> 00:13:39.027 position:50% align:center
If you were worried
the citizens were

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.738 position:50% align:center
transformed into the undead
because of resentment,

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:44.407 position:50% align:center
or a curse, or what
have you, don't.

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:47.202 position:50% align:center
Those things were never human.

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:52.123 position:50% align:center
That explains why you were
acting so strangely before.

00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:53.667 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
What's your name, lad?

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.920 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm Deflotte of Petale.

00:13:57.003 --> 00:13:59.839 position:50% align:center
Would you mind showing us
around the church, Deflotte?

00:13:59.923 --> 00:14:01.633 position:50% align:center
Could hold a clue of sorts.

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:03.009 position:50% align:center
Once we're done with that,

00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:05.261 position:50% align:center
we can pick flowers and
help you mourn your people.

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:06.346 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:09.140 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
With your blessing, of course.

00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:11.976 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Do whatever you want.

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:23.238 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] I'll be shocked if
you find anything worthwhile.

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:28.326 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
What's this?

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:30.870 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Hm?

00:14:30.954 --> 00:14:33.415 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] Looks like the
priest's journal. Interesting.

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:34.582 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Let's see what it says.

00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:36.292 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Here! I'll read it!

00:14:38.837 --> 00:14:41.214 position:50% align:center
[PRIEST] September 20th.
The word of the pope

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:43.800 position:50% align:center
has reached the ears
of our village.

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:46.136 position:50% align:center
He states the sickness
that turns people to stone

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:48.722 position:50% align:center
is a trial bestowed
upon our land by God

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:51.016 position:50% align:center
and we must endure it.

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:53.226 position:50% align:center
The Church has
also seen fit to ordain

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:56.187 position:50% align:center
that we are forbidden
from leaving the village.

00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:57.772 position:50% align:center
November 2nd.

00:14:57.856 --> 00:15:00.400 position:50% align:center
Those who could not see
this trial through to the end

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:03.778 position:50% align:center
are at least granted
salvation in death.

00:15:03.862 --> 00:15:06.448 position:50% align:center
I feel the most powerless
I have ever felt.

00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:08.742 position:50% align:center
Will God forgive me?

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:10.368 position:50% align:center
November 18th.

00:15:10.452 --> 00:15:15.331 position:50% align:center
All we can do is stay here
and pray, and pray, and pray.

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:17.709 position:50% align:center
We ask our Lord God
over and over.

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:19.377 position:50% align:center
Why our village?

00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:21.254 position:50% align:center
There are so many
people in this world,

00:15:21.338 --> 00:15:23.214 position:50% align:center
and yet it seems
we're the ones forced

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:26.926 position:50% align:center
to bear the entirety
of their suffering.

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:32.640 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] Why? Why'd you rely
on God till the very end?

00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:35.643 position:50% align:center
Why, Father?

00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:37.395 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS gasps]
Wait a minute!

00:15:37.479 --> 00:15:40.190 position:50% align:center
Like, a heavenly
father or literal?

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:43.943 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] Literal. And I hated
being the priest's son.

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:46.696 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] That wasn't
always the case, though.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.324 position:50% align:center
My father was one of the most
respected men in the village,

00:15:49.407 --> 00:15:51.618 position:50% align:center
and I was proud of him for it.

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:53.953 position:50% align:center
But when my mother passed,

00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:55.789 position:50% align:center
he insisted I take up
the cloth, too,

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:58.333 position:50% align:center
and we fought about it
every single day.

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.585 position:50% align:center
So, he drove me out,
I left my home

00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:03.088 position:50% align:center
as the disowned son of a priest.

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:06.299 position:50% align:center
But when I think about how much
he and the others suffered,

00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:10.220 position:50% align:center
I feel like I
should've been here.

00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:11.846 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:13.723 position:50% align:center
[ECCLESIASTICAL KNIGHT 3A]
Nobody move!

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:15.141 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:16:15.225 --> 00:16:16.434 position:50% align:center
[ECCLESIASTICAL KNIGHT 3A]
Stay right where you are!

00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:18.645 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
What? Ecclesiastical knights?

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:21.439 position:50% align:center
This might be a fairly
sizable problem.

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:22.941 position:50% align:center
[ECCLESIASTICAL KNIGHT 3A]
You are trespassing on

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
forbidden ground, no doubt
trying to bring back those who

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:28.613 position:50% align:center
died of the petridermic
plague back to life!

00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:30.573 position:50% align:center
Despite whether you were
successful or not,

00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:32.367 position:50% align:center
the attempt itself is treason.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:33.868 position:50% align:center
We'll burn you with
the rest of the village

00:16:33.952 --> 00:16:36.663 position:50% align:center
and purge our world of
this curse once and for all!

00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:37.789 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Are you insane?

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:39.708 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Obviously!

00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:41.167 position:50% align:center
You damn bastards!

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:42.752 position:50% align:center
[ECCLESIASTICAL KNIGHT 3A]
Hm?

00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:45.171 position:50% align:center
You forsake the village only to
come back so you can burn it?

00:16:45.255 --> 00:16:46.381 position:50% align:center
[ECCLESIASTICAL KNIGHT 3A]
We forsook this village

00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:48.383 position:50% align:center
so we could allay
the witch's curse.

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:50.260 position:50% align:center
It was a necessary sacrifice.

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:52.053 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Necessary, my ass!

00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:53.346 position:50% align:center
The people of Petale died

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.849 position:50% align:center
seeking answers from
the God you serve!

00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:58.435 position:50% align:center
What kind of monster
is your Lord and Savior

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:02.605 position:50% align:center
if the answer they were
looking for is to burn it down?

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:03.898 position:50% align:center
[ECCLESIASTICAL KNIGHT 3A]
I've heard enough.

00:17:03.982 --> 00:17:06.985 position:50% align:center
Clearly death by fire
is too kind for you.

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:13.742 position:50% align:center
[ECCLESIASTICAL KNIGHT 3A]
Are you not a royal knight?

00:17:13.825 --> 00:17:16.036 position:50% align:center
To defy us is to defy
all of Hortensia,

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.329 position:50% align:center
the very same kingdom
you swore to protect!

00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:19.748 position:50% align:center
We don't want violence.

00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:21.875 position:50% align:center
He only came to mourn
his family and friends.

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.084 position:50% align:center
Leave him be!

00:17:23.168 --> 00:17:25.170 position:50% align:center
I don't care if you
were the pope himself!

00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:27.756 position:50% align:center
You have no right to
stop him from doing that!

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:29.341 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you...?

00:17:29.424 --> 00:17:31.259 position:50% align:center
[ECCLESIASTICAL KNIGHT 3A]
Such insolence.

00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:32.802 position:50% align:center
[ECCLESIASTICAL KNIGHTS gasp]

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:34.679 position:50% align:center
What in God's name
is that thing?

00:17:34.763 --> 00:17:37.223 position:50% align:center
Did you summon it
while we weren't looking?

00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:43.938 position:50% align:center
[ECCLESIASTICAL KNIGHTS scream]

00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:47.192 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Is this another undead?

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:49.527 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
A big one.

00:17:49.611 --> 00:17:51.571 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:17:57.202 --> 00:18:00.455 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] Huh? The ugly oaf
can regenerate!

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:04.918 position:50% align:center
[QOO]
Marius! In front of you, moru!

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:06.169 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Good eye!

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center
It's a treasure trove of
Requiem flowers, moru!

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:10.632 position:50% align:center
Maybe even enough
to take on a giant!

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:12.050 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
You idiots!

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:14.469 position:50% align:center
Most of the flowers in this plot
are called Immortelles!

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:16.721 position:50% align:center
According to legend,
they're the main food source

00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:19.140 position:50% align:center
undeads use to try
and sustain themselves!

00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:21.309 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] Is that how you think
this one got so big?

00:18:21.393 --> 00:18:23.520 position:50% align:center
By eating flowers?

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
You wanna fight?

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:26.648 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:28.983 position:50% align:center
Crap!

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:30.193 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Deflotte!

00:18:33.822 --> 00:18:35.115 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] There's a way
to return the dead

00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:36.741 position:50% align:center
back to the earth, if I recall.

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:38.576 position:50% align:center
There should be
a lone Requiem Flower

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.745 position:50% align:center
blooming among
the Immortelles! Find it!

00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:43.081 position:50% align:center
Only one out of all of these?

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:45.667 position:50% align:center
[QOO]
Where, though, moru?

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.544 position:50% align:center
The grave! Hurry up!

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:49.587 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS gasps]
That's right!

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:52.132 position:50% align:center
Here goes!

00:18:52.215 --> 00:18:54.050 position:50% align:center
Like Nonorria taught me.

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.386 position:50% align:center
Hinfort, hinfort.

00:18:56.469 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
Bevor das Lied endet.
Bevor de Duft.

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:05.186 position:50% align:center
der Blume vergeht.
Bevor der Wunsch vergessen ist.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.939 position:50% align:center
Hinfort mit euch ein Jenen ort!

[ZOMBIE SPIDER GIANT 3A screams]

00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:24.789 position:50% align:center
[ZOMBIE SPIDER GIANT 3A screams]

00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:37.260 position:50% align:center
Thanks for this. It helped.

00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:38.636 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:42.557 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] My mother always
did like these flowers.

00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:51.900 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE'S FATHER]
Petale Village is all but

00:19:51.983 --> 00:19:56.154 position:50% align:center
abandoned now.
I am the only one who remains.

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:58.740 position:50% align:center
Though our situation
has been dire, O Lord,

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:02.660 position:50% align:center
I praise your name for
sparing Deflotte this sorrow.

00:20:02.744 --> 00:20:04.621 position:50% align:center
If the trade for my
health and wellbeing

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:08.875 position:50% align:center
ensures my son's, then it is
a trade I will gladly make.

00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:13.129 position:50% align:center
I will accept this trial
so that he doesn't have to.

00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:14.464 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Thinking of your son instead of

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:17.717 position:50% align:center
yourself till the
very end. Sheesh.

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:22.555 position:50% align:center
Now rest in peace,
Father. Please.

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:29.270 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] That Ecclesiastical
goon knew you were

00:20:29.354 --> 00:20:31.439 position:50% align:center
a royal knight, Alfred.

00:20:31.523 --> 00:20:34.943 position:50% align:center
But the only way he'd know that
is if Captain Georg told him.

00:20:35.026 --> 00:20:36.695 position:50% align:center
We don't have solid proof
that the captain

00:20:36.778 --> 00:20:39.239 position:50% align:center
was the one who sent those men.

00:20:39.322 --> 00:20:42.283 position:50% align:center
That's why we'll go to the
capital and deliver our report.

00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:45.078 position:50% align:center
We'll confront him about
his real motives then.

00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:51.835 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] Still here?
Knights sure move slowly.

00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:54.170 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE chuckles]
Sometimes.

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:56.715 position:50% align:center
But this particular time,
we were waiting on you.

00:20:56.798 --> 00:20:58.466 position:50% align:center
What? You want a hug?

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.760 position:50% align:center
Now that you mention it, I do!

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:03.179 position:50% align:center
How would you feel about
coming along with us?

00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:04.681 position:50% align:center
Why me of all people?

00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:07.559 position:50% align:center
Simple. You have what it
takes to be a knight.

00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:09.102 position:50% align:center
Are you crazy?

00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:12.731 position:50% align:center
I'd need the recommendation
of someone important for that!

00:21:12.814 --> 00:21:16.693 position:50% align:center
My apologies. I told you
my name when we met,

00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:18.862 position:50% align:center
but didn't say
I'm the lord of Albert.

00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:20.989 position:50% align:center
And from what I've seen
of your skills and heart,

00:21:21.072 --> 00:21:22.240 position:50% align:center
I'm willing to back you.

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:24.159 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:21:24.242 --> 00:21:28.371 position:50% align:center
Your dedication to your homeland
was enough to convince me.

00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:31.374 position:50% align:center
As a lord, I need men
with that kind of devotion

00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:33.585 position:50% align:center
to guard my people
with their lives.

00:21:33.668 --> 00:21:36.546 position:50% align:center
So, please. Come with us.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.720 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess it could be worse,
so why the hell not?

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.848 position:50% align:center
All right then.

00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:49.351 position:50% align:center
You have my spear,
Lord Alfred of Albert.

00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:52.687 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Thanks.
Here's to a brighter future.

00:23:33.455 --> 00:23:35.331 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON] What shall
we do, Sire? Any thoughts?

00:23:35.415 --> 00:23:36.458 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
They were slave traders?

00:23:36.541 --> 00:23:37.667 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
You have nothing to fear now.

00:23:37.751 --> 00:23:39.127 position:50% align:center
[SARIA]
I don't remember saying that.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.171 position:50% align:center
[ELVA] You did, because now
it's my turn to be right.

00:23:41.254 --> 00:23:43.006 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] I can't sit
idly by--I have to act!

00:23:43.089 --> 00:23:44.424 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
I'm not afraid of you.

00:23:44.507 --> 00:23:46.593 position:50% align:center
I'll fight you
like the knight I am!
