00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.433 position:50% align:center
How are you here?

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:20.145 position:50% align:center
I buried you myself.
With my own two hands!

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.566 position:50% align:center
It can't be.

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:27.819 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Father.

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:15.760 position:50% align:center
[KING] Why? Why has
my wish not been fulfilled?

00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:18.513 position:50% align:center
Because it's no small feat.

00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:21.307 position:50% align:center
Reviving the dead requires
the greatest of skill,

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:23.727 position:50% align:center
even for those who
have powers of legend.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.813 position:50% align:center
We must locate a Magonian witch.

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:28.815 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON] I don't believe
that will be necessary,

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:30.775 position:50% align:center
for the source of
this magic is derived

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:33.528 position:50% align:center
from hopes and aspirations.

00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:35.780 position:50% align:center
No use finding a witch
when you already have

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:37.907 position:50% align:center
the perfect person to draw from.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:40.160 position:50% align:center
[KING]
You don't mean Rugis?

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:42.245 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON] It takes a fair
amount of ambition to become

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:45.749 position:50% align:center
a celebrated hero throughout
an entire kingdom.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.667 position:50% align:center
[KING] So, I should
utilize those ambitions

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:49.377 position:50% align:center
that exist within him?

00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:51.588 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON]
Yes. Take hold of his dreams

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:54.507 position:50% align:center
as well as his strength of will.

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:57.344 position:50% align:center
[KING] But to exploit
a faithful subject.

00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:00.347 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON] Faithful.
Such an interesting adjective.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.556 position:50% align:center
Was he being "faithful" when he

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.059 position:50% align:center
objected to you
cutting off your support?

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:07.479 position:50% align:center
Lest we forget the whispers
regarding a mutiny.

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:12.442 position:50% align:center
You have a choice and it's
an easy one, my lord.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:15.362 position:50% align:center
You will be thwarting the duke
before he can even make a move.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:17.364 position:50% align:center
And best of all,
the wish you hold

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:20.283 position:50% align:center
deep in your heart
will be realized.

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:24.162 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON chuckles]

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.875 position:50% align:center
[RUGIS] My soldiers are
exhausted from fighting Daire,

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.795 position:50% align:center
and the people are stretched
to the breaking point.

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.464 position:50% align:center
My lord. For the sake
of all Camellians,

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:37.467 position:50% align:center
please extend your
support to us once again.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.554 position:50% align:center
I can't recall your military
doing anything for years now.

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:44.432 position:50% align:center
Why should you be rewarded
for nothing, Rugis?

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:46.768 position:50% align:center
I take no pride in this.

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:48.311 position:50% align:center
And what's more.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:51.523 position:50% align:center
You still have not brought me
the head of Daire's emperor.

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:54.734 position:50% align:center
I believe I may have
put too much faith in you.

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:58.405 position:50% align:center
For if you were capable of it,
the deed would be done already!

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:01.741 position:50% align:center
[RUGIS]
I agree, Your Majesty.

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:03.118 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON]
Anger is the strongest,

00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:05.370 position:50% align:center
most primitive of emotions.

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:08.331 position:50% align:center
Which is why it should be
the one you seek to trigger.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:09.582 position:50% align:center
You're sure of this?

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.918 position:50% align:center
His anger's the key
to his power?

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:14.045 position:50% align:center
Yes, if you go
about this correctly.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.924 position:50% align:center
Cause him to release his
inhibitions with your words.

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:20.343 position:50% align:center
Perhaps granting you
the title "Templar Knight"

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:21.928 position:50% align:center
made you overconfident!

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:24.806 position:50% align:center
If I may, Rugis has risked
his life for the kingdom

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.307 position:50% align:center
time and time again.

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:27.434 position:50% align:center
He's loyal to you, sire!

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
Leon, don't.

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:29.894 position:50% align:center
Rugis.

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:32.731 position:50% align:center
Are you knights
conspiring against me?

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:34.399 position:50% align:center
Oh, but of course you are!

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:37.819 position:50% align:center
You're planning a revolt, so
you'd want Olivier on your side!

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:38.737 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.322 position:50% align:center
Seize these traitors!

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.908 position:50% align:center
[LEON]
Your Majesty, be rational!

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:45.118 position:50% align:center
[KING]
But I am!

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:46.745 position:50% align:center
The duke of Camellia
thought I was unaware

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:49.330 position:50% align:center
of his scheme,
but he was mistaken!

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:51.541 position:50% align:center
Hortensia shall strike first!

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:54.794 position:50% align:center
All that will remain
of your land is ashes!

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:57.213 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't dare!

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.262 position:50% align:center
[KING]
What's the matter, Rugis?

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:06.890 position:50% align:center
Have I struck a nerve with you?

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:12.270 position:50% align:center
What brought about
this wrath? This betrayal?

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:16.566 position:50% align:center
My lord, is this how you treat
your devoted retainers?

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:19.027 position:50% align:center
Tell me!

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:25.200 position:50% align:center
What is happening to me?

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:28.203 position:50% align:center
At last! It's undeniable!

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:30.830 position:50% align:center
Your entire body is
brimming with power!

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:33.249 position:50% align:center
I can feel it from
where I stand!

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
Is he transforming?

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:43.426 position:50% align:center
[RUGIS]
This sorcery. What've you done?

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.012 position:50% align:center
Answer me now!

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:51.518 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE gasps]

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:55.772 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:00.068 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA]
It's snowing.

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:01.736 position:50% align:center
[QOO]
Is that bad, moru?

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.822 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA] When Maurice
returned to Albert's Dominion

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:05.740 position:50% align:center
after Lord Fernando passed,

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:08.034 position:50% align:center
he told me it snowed
the night he was slain.

00:06:08.118 --> 00:06:10.829 position:50% align:center
[QOO]
Yeah, it did, moru.

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:12.080 position:50% align:center
Do you know the path
the others took

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:13.498 position:50% align:center
to get inside the castle?

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:14.541 position:50% align:center
Moru?

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:16.835 position:50% align:center
I wanna help! Please, Qoo!

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:19.629 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE]
No way.

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:23.591 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] Brother. But how
is this even possible?

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:26.219 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE]
Stop! Please, stand down!

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:27.429 position:50% align:center
Get back, Your Highness!

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:28.596 position:50% align:center
How can I?

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.807 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
This is our fight, not yours.

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:36.604 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID] His swordsmanship
is identical to my father's.

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.775 position:50% align:center
Damn that pope to hell and back.

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:45.989 position:50% align:center
If you're in there, then come
to your senses, Brother!

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:48.366 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE screams]

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:51.953 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED gasps]
Are you all right?

00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:53.663 position:50% align:center
Pay attention!

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:05.383 position:50% align:center
[FERNANDO]
You must defeat me, Alfred.

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:08.970 position:50% align:center
The pope is controlling my body
despite my mind's objections.

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:10.513 position:50% align:center
There's nothing I can do.

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:14.517 position:50% align:center
Unless you can stop me,
I will kill you all.

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:15.727 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
No.

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:19.522 position:50% align:center
[LEON] If you refuse,
then you choose death.

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:20.899 position:50% align:center
I could never!

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:26.654 position:50% align:center
[LEON] Adelheid.
I'm asking as your father.

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:29.074 position:50% align:center
Will you set me free?

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:30.950 position:50% align:center
Please, don't.

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:39.376 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED, MARIELLE]
No, Maurice!

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.211 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
You won't be killing anyone.

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:43.338 position:50% align:center
I'll defend both
the princess and Alfred,

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:45.882 position:50% align:center
no matter what it takes.

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:48.510 position:50% align:center
That's what I promised you
before you died,

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:51.012 position:50% align:center
and it's an oath
I intend to keep!

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:57.018 position:50% align:center
Run, Maurice. Or you'll perish!

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.314 position:50% align:center
[LEON] Take that last step
and surpass me.

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:02.691 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:05.235 position:50% align:center
[LEON]
Show me how much you've grown.

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:10.240 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] If your soul
is being held captive,

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.826 position:50% align:center
then I'll be the one to save it!

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:15.912 position:50% align:center
Doing otherwise would go
against my code of chivalry.

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:19.040 position:50% align:center
Everything I love.
I'll protect it all!

00:08:19.124 --> 00:08:21.668 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID] I won't rely on
the mere reach of my spear.

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:23.878 position:50% align:center
I'll predict the changing tides,

00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:26.214 position:50% align:center
and relieve Father
from his agony!

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:32.470 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID]
No way!

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:34.389 position:50% align:center
Am I dreaming,
or did I really beat you?

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:37.642 position:50% align:center
[LEON chuckles]
It's no dream.

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:41.021 position:50% align:center
I've met my match in you.
Nicely done.

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:44.399 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:52.574 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID]
It's strange.

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:55.827 position:50% align:center
Because you were dead and gone,

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.456 position:50% align:center
I never thought we'd be able
to exchange blows again.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.875 position:50% align:center
So, I can't help but be glad.

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:06.755 position:50% align:center
Look how strong you've become.
You've made me proud.

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:09.883 position:50% align:center
You'll soon outdo me
in every sense of the word.

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:11.926 position:50% align:center
I wish it had been
under better circumstances,

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.429 position:50% align:center
but to witness
your growth like this.

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:16.181 position:50% align:center
I'm so grateful.

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:20.935 position:50% align:center
Father. There's so much
that I want to say to you.

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:23.396 position:50% align:center
I never got the chance.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.815 position:50% align:center
[LEON] Everything you're
feeling was conveyed to me

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.901 position:50% align:center
through the strike
of your blade.

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:30.653 position:50% align:center
Surely, you must
have felt it, too.

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:34.074 position:50% align:center
[FERNANDO] Now, move forward.
Together with the princess.

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:36.993 position:50% align:center
I'll continue to watch over you

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:39.412 position:50% align:center
and pray for
a prosperous future.

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:42.207 position:50% align:center
May it burn as bright
as your heart does.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:51.758 position:50% align:center
Farewell.

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:55.303 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE groans]

00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:56.680 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED gasps]

00:09:56.763 --> 00:10:00.517 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE chuckles]
Fernando's fairly impressive,

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.519 position:50% align:center
even in death.

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:03.436 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Maurice!

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.313 position:50% align:center
We should get you treated!

00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:07.816 position:50% align:center
I'm fine. You two go on ahead.

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:10.068 position:50% align:center
We can't just
leave you in this state!

00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:12.487 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] But if you take me
with you in this state,

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.572 position:50% align:center
I'll only slow you down.

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.910 position:50% align:center
And besides, I wanna
take this chance

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:21.037 position:50% align:center
to spend time with my brother.

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:23.206 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
All right.

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:25.750 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE]
Please. Don't do anything rash.

00:10:30.422 --> 00:10:32.340 position:50% align:center
What you do think, huh?

00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:36.219 position:50% align:center
That good? I kept them
safe just like I said.

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:39.848 position:50% align:center
And I got to fight you
once more in the end.

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:42.976 position:50% align:center
I can die happily now.

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:59.117 position:50% align:center
You're absolutely positive
this is the right way?

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.119 position:50% align:center
[QOO] All I've got is my gut,
and it's telling me

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:03.246 position:50% align:center
we have to cross here, moru.

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:04.956 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA sighs]
Is it me,

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.709 position:50% align:center
or are those bodies
in the water?

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:10.253 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA screams]

00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:11.338 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Huh?

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:12.297 position:50% align:center
[QOO, NONNORIA]
Huh?

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.965 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA]
Deflotte?

00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:16.301 position:50% align:center
Why the heck are you two here?

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:17.594 position:50% align:center
We were worried about Alfred,

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:18.928 position:50% align:center
so we came to
help him out, moru.

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:21.306 position:50% align:center
You could've been a little
more vague, you know!

00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:22.474 position:50% align:center
Ah, I gotcha now.

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:24.893 position:50% align:center
--Moru?
--Huh?

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:27.771 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] Right then. Better
hustle if we wanna catch up.

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:29.064 position:50% align:center
Moru!

00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:35.570 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE] The pope should be
just beyond there.

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:37.989 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Which means
this war's almost over.

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:40.742 position:50% align:center
Without you, I'd be dead.

00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:43.119 position:50% align:center
I never would've
gotten even half this far.

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:44.621 position:50% align:center
I'm your knight, Princess.

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:47.040 position:50% align:center
I shall follow you
wherever you go.

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:49.209 position:50% align:center
And the path you're
walking feels right.

00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:52.712 position:50% align:center
I wish I had better words,
but thank you.

00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:54.172 position:50% align:center
For all you've done.

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:58.385 position:50% align:center
Heh. Your thanks is more
than I deserve, Princess Mari--

00:11:58.468 --> 00:11:59.678 position:50% align:center
You look a bit perplexed.

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:02.514 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Uh... I'm fine.
C'mon. We should hurry!

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:03.765 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:11.022 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE gasps]
Charlot!

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:13.650 position:50% align:center
You're okay!

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:19.948 position:50% align:center
Wait... is it really you?
When did I get here?

00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:22.033 position:50% align:center
If you only knew how much
I worried about you

00:12:22.117 --> 00:12:24.494 position:50% align:center
over the years
we were torn apart!

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:26.454 position:50% align:center
Marielle, don't cry.

00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:29.082 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON chuckles]

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:30.959 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE]
Vall d'Hebron!

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:33.712 position:50% align:center
So touching to see
siblings reunite like this.

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:35.964 position:50% align:center
I practically
felt my heart melt.

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:38.550 position:50% align:center
And while we're on
the subject of reunions.

00:12:38.633 --> 00:12:41.428 position:50% align:center
How was it seeing
your father after so long?

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:42.929 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE gasps]

00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:45.640 position:50% align:center
Honestly? I'm grateful to you.

00:12:45.724 --> 00:12:47.475 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:49.477 position:50% align:center
I didn't just see my father.

00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:52.397 position:50% align:center
I got to show him that I'm
living as he hoped I would.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.066 position:50% align:center
That miracle would've been
impossible if not for you.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.110 position:50% align:center
Or your Magonian power,
at least.

00:12:57.193 --> 00:13:01.740 position:50% align:center
Ah. You may be as sharp as the
blade strapped to your belt.

00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:05.869 position:50% align:center
Pope Vall d'Hebron.
Why do you seek this magic?

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:08.329 position:50% align:center
And what are you planning
to do to Hortensia with it?

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:10.582 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON] I really don't
think it's worth mentioning.

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:12.876 position:50% align:center
But I suppose if you
must know, my true goal

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.669 position:50% align:center
is to preserve peace
in the kingdom.

00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
What peace do you speak of?

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:17.881 position:50% align:center
The kind I know
doesn't require you

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:20.508 position:50% align:center
to defile the dead
and control monsters!

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:22.344 position:50% align:center
Dear princess,
the most efficient way

00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:25.180 position:50% align:center
to unify people is to
give them a common enemy.

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:28.600 position:50% align:center
And what better foe than things
you see in nightmares?

00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:30.435 position:50% align:center
So, while you may
not see this power

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:35.190 position:50% align:center
as a necessity in order to rule,
I very much beg to disagree.

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:39.277 position:50% align:center
Charlot! Go hide somewhere safe!

00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:44.908 position:50% align:center
Only when a threat appears
do people band together.

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:48.244 position:50% align:center
Opposing sides that butted heads
find themselves joining hands.

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:51.498 position:50% align:center
It's their nature to survive.

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:52.791 position:50% align:center
And my power grows with

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:55.502 position:50% align:center
every despairing plea
they offer to God.

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:57.087 position:50% align:center
Little do they know
their prayers

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.214 position:50% align:center
are what fuels the
source of their grief.

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:01.841 position:50% align:center
You're not the pope for
that sole reason, are you?

00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:04.594 position:50% align:center
I keep accumulating
more and more of this power.

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:06.680 position:50% align:center
It's an ingenious cycle,
you must admit.

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:09.683 position:50% align:center
And it will bring about
eternal prosperity.

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:14.229 position:50% align:center
I'll put the detestable
Hortensia family to shame.

00:14:14.312 --> 00:14:16.439 position:50% align:center
Your father did shamefully
cast out my mother

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:19.651 position:50% align:center
once he had his fun,
so I'd say he got a head start!

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:21.444 position:50% align:center
He what?

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:23.571 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON] It's poetic
justice for me to take control

00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:27.075 position:50% align:center
of his kingdom and destroy the
family he actually claimed.

00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:30.787 position:50% align:center
And soon I'll have it!
Ultimate retribution!

00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:50.890 position:50% align:center
[cackles]

00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:51.891 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE gasps]

00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:54.644 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Are those
things monsters?

00:14:54.728 --> 00:14:55.895 position:50% align:center
[DIABLE VALL D'HEBRON]
Oh, no, dear boy.

00:14:55.979 --> 00:14:57.731 position:50% align:center
Not even remotely close.

00:14:57.814 --> 00:15:00.442 position:50% align:center
We are divine beings
with godlike powers.

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:04.237 position:50% align:center
If we must have a title,
you may call us diables.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.906 position:50% align:center
I think you're confusing
divine with demonic!

00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:14.664 position:50% align:center
It healed itself?

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:16.624 position:50% align:center
No!

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:19.669 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Please stay back!

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.590 position:50% align:center
Are you really
so foolish to believe

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:26.468 position:50% align:center
mortals have any hope
of defeating diable?

00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:32.724 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:33.850 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE]
Look out!

00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:37.812 position:50% align:center
Impossible!

00:15:37.896 --> 00:15:39.606 position:50% align:center
I'm not here
just to cheer you on.

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:41.232 position:50% align:center
Plus, how can I be
a leader to others

00:15:41.316 --> 00:15:43.985 position:50% align:center
if I can't even
fight my own battles?

00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:47.155 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] This power.
She used it on Didier.

00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:52.118 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
It extends to my sword!

00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:54.496 position:50% align:center
You impudent fools
are going to pay!

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:56.289 position:50% align:center
I'll make you feel
the pain of my wrath

00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:58.875 position:50% align:center
if it's the last thing I do!

00:16:02.087 --> 00:16:08.343 position:50% align:center
[cackles] Now submit and
vanish into nothingness!

00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:11.304 position:50% align:center
[cackles]

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:14.641 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:16.101 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Duke Rugis!

00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:18.395 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE]
What are you doing here?

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:20.647 position:50% align:center
I was hoping I could thank you.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.108 position:50% align:center
Because of your army's invasion,
I managed to make it

00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:25.860 position:50% align:center
all the way to the throne room
without any trouble.

00:16:25.944 --> 00:16:26.861 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED gasps]

00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:30.156 position:50% align:center
[groans] I see.
You kept it quiet,

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.575 position:50% align:center
but it seems you're
another daft Bearer!

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:35.120 position:50% align:center
It's been four years
since we last met,

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:37.163 position:50% align:center
yet my anger still feels fresh.

00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:39.499 position:50% align:center
I remember it like
it was yesterday.

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:41.292 position:50% align:center
Monsters only plague
this world now

00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:44.087 position:50% align:center
because of the anger you've
clung to for all these years.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.507 position:50% align:center
A kingdom brought to its
knees from one bad temper.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:51.720 position:50% align:center
So really my judgment was
as sound then as it is now.

00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:53.013 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Wait a moment!

00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:54.931 position:50% align:center
Did you stage that coup
of your own volition,

00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:56.641 position:50% align:center
or were you a puppet?

00:16:56.725 --> 00:16:58.977 position:50% align:center
Makes no difference
at this point.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.104 position:50% align:center
We need to focus on
finishing off this eyesore

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:04.357 position:50% align:center
and bringing the tragedy of
the past four years to a close.

00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:07.569 position:50% align:center
I fought hard to gain the
power to control this land.

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:10.488 position:50% align:center
So, I'll fight even harder
to maintain my rule!

00:17:10.572 --> 00:17:11.322 position:50% align:center
[RUGIS]
After you.

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:12.741 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE, ALFRED]
Right!

00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:14.659 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE, ALFRED yell]

00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:23.918 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:25.420 position:50% align:center
Go, now!

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.158 position:50% align:center
If ever a man lived up
to his father, it's you.

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:59.037 position:50% align:center
I appreciate that.
Thanks for lending a sword.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.748 position:50% align:center
Truly! We couldn't have
done it without you.

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:05.585 position:50% align:center
[RUGIS] Save your gratitude
for someone worthy of it.

00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:09.214 position:50% align:center
My purpose for fighting him was
not to win you back your crown.

00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:11.174 position:50% align:center
You came for the relic.

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:13.009 position:50% align:center
So, then you know of it.

00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:14.302 position:50% align:center
I don't know much,

00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:17.055 position:50% align:center
but I do know its
magic creates conflict.

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:18.264 position:50% align:center
It's bound to bring ruin,

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:21.309 position:50% align:center
even in the hands of
someone who's honorable.

00:18:21.393 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
Such evil shouldn't
exist in our world.

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:27.482 position:50% align:center
My, you have grown.

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:29.317 position:50% align:center
I know now without a doubt.

00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:31.069 position:50% align:center
You're the leader
this land needs.

00:18:31.152 --> 00:18:33.863 position:50% align:center
With the means to usher in
a new age of peace.

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:35.240 position:50% align:center
But to do that,

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:38.326 position:50% align:center
I'll need the support of
heroes such as yourself.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:41.204 position:50% align:center
All right. Let's make
this official.

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:44.332 position:50% align:center
Will you take up your sword
for Hortensia's sake, again?

00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:46.835 position:50% align:center
Princess, are you certain?

00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:49.796 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON cackles]

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:51.172 position:50% align:center
Don't mind me.

00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:53.925 position:50% align:center
I'm just enjoying watching
this farce play out.

00:18:54.009 --> 00:18:56.136 position:50% align:center
Some people should
learn when to die.

00:18:56.219 --> 00:18:57.721 position:50% align:center
Oh, I can't die yet.

00:18:57.804 --> 00:19:00.724 position:50% align:center
There's a secret
I want brought to light.

00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:02.767 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:05.020 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
What's happening?

00:19:05.103 --> 00:19:06.646 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE]
Look at the sky!

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.608 position:50% align:center
Tell me where the
relic is right now!

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:13.862 position:50% align:center
The one place that
I know it's not, is here.

00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:15.905 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] The relic's
no longer in the castle,

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:18.324 position:50% align:center
yet you could still
use Magonian magic?

00:19:18.408 --> 00:19:20.618 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON]
Didier took it and disappeared.

00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:24.706 position:50% align:center
Since it was his to begin with,
who was I to stop him?

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:37.927 position:50% align:center
Is he...?

00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:40.096 position:50% align:center
[RUGIS growling]

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
So it was you?

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:44.642 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:46.353 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE]
He's the werewolf!

00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:51.316 position:50% align:center
A superb ending
to this little tale.

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:56.738 position:50% align:center
Alfred, no!

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:06.748 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Rugis, you killed
my father and so many others!

00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:07.707 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:09.501 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
You stole everything!

00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:12.212 position:50% align:center
Do you know how much pain
and suffering you've caused?

00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:13.755 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED grunts]

00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:24.557 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE gasps]

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:28.186 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE]
Alfred!

00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:38.071 position:50% align:center
Open your eyes and
stay with me, please!

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:42.075 position:50% align:center
Princess? Is that
your voice I hear?

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:45.912 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm right here.
I have you in my arms.

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:48.415 position:50% align:center
You're okay. What a relief.

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:51.626 position:50% align:center
You protected me.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:55.422 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] I wasn't very good
at upholding my oath.

00:20:55.505 --> 00:20:57.048 position:50% align:center
Yes, you were.

00:20:57.132 --> 00:21:00.677 position:50% align:center
You kept me from harm
just like you said you would.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.928 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
The other one.

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:03.763 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:06.850 position:50% align:center
I made you a deal that day.

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:11.021 position:50% align:center
I said I'd call you Marius
when we were alone.

00:21:11.104 --> 00:21:13.398 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That's right.

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:16.151 position:50% align:center
But why think of that now?

00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:18.987 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Promises should be remembered.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.572 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:22.490 position:50% align:center
You're here.

00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:25.910 position:50% align:center
Your long journey
has come to an end.

00:21:25.994 --> 00:21:27.287 position:50% align:center
Which means I--

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.123 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare
tell me goodbye! Not yet.

00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:31.416 position:50% align:center
You're the princess's knight

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:33.585 position:50% align:center
and one of the best friends
I've ever had!

00:21:33.668 --> 00:21:36.838 position:50% align:center
And what's even more,
is that I'm your squire.

00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:39.966 position:50% align:center
That means wherever you go,
I follow right behind.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:43.595 position:50% align:center
But it only works in
this world, so don't leave.

00:21:43.678 --> 00:21:45.930 position:50% align:center
That's very true.

00:21:46.014 --> 00:21:48.433 position:50% align:center
Let's go home to Albert.

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:52.437 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Our hill's waiting for us.

00:21:54.439 --> 00:21:57.734 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Once again, you and I...

00:21:57.817 --> 00:21:59.694 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE gasps]

00:21:59.778 --> 00:22:04.407 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE crying]

00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:12.916 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE] After witnessing
the way the pope

00:22:12.999 --> 00:22:15.251 position:50% align:center
broke our kingdom,
I sought to repair it.

00:22:15.335 --> 00:22:17.087 position:50% align:center
Our future was stolen.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:18.588 position:50% align:center
Though not for long.

00:22:18.672 --> 00:22:21.758 position:50% align:center
I was able to rise up and
reclaim what was taken from us.

00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:25.387 position:50% align:center
That being said, I didn't
accomplish this by myself.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:28.098 position:50% align:center
I had an army of
people helping me.

00:22:28.181 --> 00:22:30.475 position:50% align:center
And I doubt there's a
single soul in all of Hortensia

00:22:30.558 --> 00:22:35.271 position:50% align:center
who wasn't wounded, killed,
or somehow affected by this war.

00:22:35.355 --> 00:22:36.773 position:50% align:center
Although they may be gone,

00:22:36.856 --> 00:22:38.566 position:50% align:center
if your loved ones
died for the kingdom,

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:40.068 position:50% align:center
then they died heroes!

00:22:40.151 --> 00:22:46.616 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheers]

00:22:56.209 --> 00:22:59.629 position:50% align:center
The princess has committed
a grave taboo.

00:22:59.713 --> 00:23:02.298 position:50% align:center
There was a latent
power within her.

00:23:02.382 --> 00:23:04.843 position:50% align:center
And it should've
stayed that way.

00:23:06.511 --> 00:23:09.889 position:50% align:center
Come back to me!

00:23:29.576 --> 00:23:32.287 position:50% align:center
[LACROIX] She's blind to the
truth right in front of her,

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:34.122 position:50% align:center
but make no mistake.

00:23:34.205 --> 00:23:37.751 position:50% align:center
That young man did,
in fact, die that day.
