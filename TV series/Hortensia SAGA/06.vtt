00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:15.932 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] Once upon a time,
in a faraway kingdom,

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:19.185 position:50% align:center
there was a beautiful,
kindhearted princess.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.563 position:50% align:center
Alas, she was forced
to flee her realm

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:24.399 position:50% align:center
and take refuge
on a small island.

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:25.900 position:50% align:center
While wandering this island,

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:29.404 position:50% align:center
she came across a massive,
ancient statue made of stone.

00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:31.197 position:50% align:center
Eventually, those
pursuing the princess

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:34.325 position:50% align:center
managed to track her down,
but before they could attack,

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:35.994 position:50% align:center
the statue suddenly
sprang to life

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:38.329 position:50% align:center
and protected the runaway royal.

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:42.959 position:50% align:center
Her heart had been pure enough
to spur the giant into action.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:45.670 position:50% align:center
With her new, colossal
ally by her side,

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:49.549 position:50% align:center
the princess returned home
to her kingdom and reclaimed it.

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:53.595 position:50% align:center
The Legend of the
Princess and the Giant

00:00:53.678 --> 00:00:55.805 position:50% align:center
has been told for ages.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:59.476 position:50% align:center
Juin Island is said to be where
this tale actually took place.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.644 position:50% align:center
And we're standing
on it right now!

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.772 position:50% align:center
Hold on! Are you even listening?

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:05.607 position:50% align:center
I told that entire story
for your sake,

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.442 position:50% align:center
but it seems you
couldn't care less!

00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:09.444 position:50% align:center
Story time isn't
really my priority

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:11.780 position:50% align:center
when it's all sunny at
the beach, you know?

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:14.032 position:50% align:center
You should take your
shirt off and join us, Marius.

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:16.951 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Now that's just silly!

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:19.537 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Leave him be.

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:21.247 position:50% align:center
You've had your fun, Deflotte.

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:22.540 position:50% align:center
That's not why we
came here, though.

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:25.502 position:50% align:center
Huh? Remind me
why that is again?

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:29.005 position:50% align:center
We received yet another
request from Captain Georg.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:30.340 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
A young woman claiming to be

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:32.217 position:50% align:center
the missing Princess
Marielle has turned up

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.135 position:50% align:center
here on Juin Island.

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.846 position:50% align:center
What's more, is an army
made up of volunteers

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.348 position:50% align:center
has centered around this woman

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:41.142 position:50% align:center
and their numbers are steadily
growing by the day.

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:46.356 position:50% align:center
[JIM]
Princess Marielle.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.692 position:50% align:center
It's nearly time
for your address.

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:49.901 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Right.

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:54.948 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] I shall fulfill
my duty to lead the people.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.462 position:50% align:center
[JIM] Members of the volunteer
army and those who wish to be.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:35.173 position:50% align:center
Your wait is over,
the princess'll be here soon!

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:37.801 position:50% align:center
[ARMY, CANDIDATES cheer]

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:40.053 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] I think they
might like this girl.

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:42.263 position:50% align:center
Maybe she's
the real deal after all.

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:43.973 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll see.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.518 position:50% align:center
She's garnered
quite a following.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.605 position:50% align:center
Marius. Don't worry, moru.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.232 position:50% align:center
It's not that I'm worried, Qoo.

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:53.817 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.570 position:50% align:center
I'm wondering how long I'll
have to keep up this facade.

00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.864 position:50% align:center
Adelheid is searching
for me, too.

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:03.535 position:50% align:center
I wish I could be honest and
tell everyone who I really am.

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:04.786 position:50% align:center
Moru.

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:06.871 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
There isn't any rush.

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:08.707 position:50% align:center
But when you do
decide to come clean,

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.959 position:50% align:center
we'll protect you
with all we have.

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.878 position:50% align:center
Please just be sure to
think it through first.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:19.509 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] I need to
stand firm in my resolve.

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:21.052 position:50% align:center
The commotion
this imposter started

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:23.805 position:50% align:center
only came about because
of my choice to hide,

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:26.433 position:50% align:center
and is therefore
my responsibility.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.935 position:50% align:center
[ARMY, CANDIDATES]
Marielle! Marielle!

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:33.732 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] Ta-da! Your favorite
princess is here to stay!

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:40.572 position:50% align:center
[ARMY, CANDIDATES cheering]

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:42.198 position:50% align:center
I suppose good news travels fast

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.117 position:50% align:center
since there are
so many people here!

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.162 position:50% align:center
First, we have
the volunteer army!

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:49.664 position:50% align:center
[VOLUNTEER ARMY cheers]

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:53.460 position:50% align:center
Then there's also army wannabes!

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
[CANDIDATES cheer]

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.796 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED, DEFLOTTE]
Uh. Yeah.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.757 position:50% align:center
[QOO]
Yoo-hoo?

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.675 position:50% align:center
Please, lend me your ears!

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.887 position:50% align:center
Everywhere I look,
I see fierce monsters and war.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.723 position:50% align:center
I see terrible diseases
plague our land.

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:09.351 position:50% align:center
And yet the Orthodox
Church does nothing.

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:11.770 position:50% align:center
But we won't stand
for that behavior!

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:14.230 position:50% align:center
Divided, we may be weak,
but together we're strong,

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.524 position:50% align:center
so let's defend Juin Island
from the church!

00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:19.569 position:50% align:center
Because I believe in you!

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:21.363 position:50% align:center
So, she's the princess
of Hortensia.

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.198 position:50% align:center
You have more sense than that.

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:24.783 position:50% align:center
Check it out!

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:27.160 position:50% align:center
The legendary giant can carry
the weight of all your dreams

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
and still march
proudly into action!

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:33.083 position:50% align:center
That story about
the giant is real, moru!

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.793 position:50% align:center
Qoo, don't be ridiculous.

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:37.504 position:50% align:center
That's faker than
my enthusiasm right now.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.387 position:50% align:center
[ARMY, CANDIDATES cheer]

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.889 position:50% align:center
And thus concludes
our gathering today!

00:05:47.972 --> 00:05:50.767 position:50% align:center
Farewell for now!

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:55.814 position:50% align:center
Well, I had a gut feeling
it would be something like this.

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:56.815 position:50% align:center
Ready to leave?

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:58.817 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.277 position:50% align:center
Uh, what's wrong?

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.114 position:50% align:center
This so-called princess
is making a fool of herself!

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
She has got to be
stopped at any cost!

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:12.205 position:50% align:center
[JIM] That was another
phenomenal performance,

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:13.707 position:50% align:center
Princess Marielle.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.500 position:50% align:center
Thanks to your efforts,
new applicants are

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:18.461 position:50% align:center
coming out to join
our cause in droves.

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:20.755 position:50% align:center
You've assured peace
and safety for Juin Island.

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.007 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.008 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.221 position:50% align:center
Are you tired?
Perhaps you should rest.

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:31.641 position:50% align:center
[JIM] I can handle
everything from here.

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:33.643 position:50% align:center
I, uh--

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.270 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 6A]
Princess Marielle!

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:37.022 position:50% align:center
We come bearing urgent news!

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:38.440 position:50% align:center
Go on, what is it?

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:40.483 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 6B] Right.
The Orthodox Church is currently

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:42.736 position:50% align:center
on the lookout for
Princess Marielle.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:44.070 position:50% align:center
And they're doing so
under the guise

00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:45.905 position:50% align:center
of witch-hunts
throughout the kingdom.

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:47.032 position:50% align:center
You're sure?

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:48.283 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 6B]
Yes, and if they discover

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:50.368 position:50% align:center
the real one is on our island--

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:54.581 position:50% align:center
Your Highness! Now's the time
for us to strike back!

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:56.082 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:57.542 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 6A] You easily have
more than enough supporters

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.002 position:50% align:center
for us to charge the capital!

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50% align:center
That no-good Orthodox
Church is goin' down!

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.173 position:50% align:center
Well, let's not be rash.

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:05.842 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 6B] This is our true
freedom on the line here!

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:08.887 position:50% align:center
I understand.
And I do want to be free.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.389 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 6A] Hear that?
The princess agrees with us!

00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:12.766 position:50% align:center
No! I, uh...

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:15.685 position:50% align:center
Aren't you getting
a bit carried away?

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:16.770 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 6A]
Let's go strategize!

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:18.188 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 6B]
And spread the word!

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:20.690 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS]
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:21.775 position:50% align:center
This is bad.

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:24.110 position:50% align:center
They can't just advance
on the capital.

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.237 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm well aware.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:28.907 position:50% align:center
[JIM]
I'll go speak with them.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.909 position:50% align:center
You go to your room
and lie down.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.089 position:50% align:center
Took forever to get here.

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:47.300 position:50% align:center
[ELVA] No kidding.
It was way too much work.

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:49.511 position:50% align:center
But you just had to see
this legendary giant

00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:51.805 position:50% align:center
in person, didn't you, Thalia?

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:53.807 position:50% align:center
Nuh-uh. You're the one
who said that.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.017 position:50% align:center
That definitely never happened.

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:58.728 position:50% align:center
But now it's my turn
to be right, Elva.

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:01.064 position:50% align:center
Fine. Then I said it.

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:03.900 position:50% align:center
So, do you think the princess
and the giant are real?

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:05.902 position:50% align:center
Or a couple of fakes?

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:08.071 position:50% align:center
[THALIA]
I'd be happy either way.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.824 position:50% align:center
Because if they're real,
we'll take them back with us.

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:13.576 position:50% align:center
If they're fake,
we can destroy them.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.872 position:50% align:center
[THALIA, ELVA laugh]

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:27.465 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] How long do I
have to keep this up?

00:08:27.549 --> 00:08:28.800 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:30.135 position:50% align:center
There you are!

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:31.970 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Who's there?

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:34.222 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] Say your prayers,
you big phony!

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:37.434 position:50% align:center
I am Alfred Albert,
lord of Albert's Dominion.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:40.395 position:50% align:center
I came to this island
on Captain Georg's behalf

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:44.024 position:50% align:center
to investigate the woman
claiming to be the princess.

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:46.359 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] We already know
those claims are false.

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:47.360 position:50% align:center
So, resisting us is fut--

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:49.404 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry!

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:51.156 position:50% align:center
If I knew things would
turn out like this,

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:53.199 position:50% align:center
I never would've done it.

00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:55.869 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
Sounds like there might be

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:58.121 position:50% align:center
a good reason you did, though.

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:03.126 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Mind telling me your real name?

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:04.419 position:50% align:center
My name's Marie.

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:06.796 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] All right.
So, what made you pretend

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.590 position:50% align:center
to be the missing
princess, Marie?

00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:10.383 position:50% align:center
Will you tell me that, too?

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:16.890 position:50% align:center
When it first started,
it was nothing more than a game.

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:19.642 position:50% align:center
My childhood friend, Jim,
would pretend he was a knight,

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:21.853 position:50% align:center
and I, his princess.

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:23.897 position:50% align:center
Is the rumor about
the monsters true?

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.609 position:50% align:center
It is. It attacked the
village and hurt people.

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:30.195 position:50% align:center
Ever since Princess
Marielle went missing,

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:33.448 position:50% align:center
the state of the kingdom
grows more dire.

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:36.493 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry.
I promise I'll keep you safe.

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.536 position:50% align:center
[MARIE giggles]
Yeah, you better.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.539 position:50% align:center
What's a knight captain
without his princess to protect?

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:45.251 position:50% align:center
[JIM chuckles] Wanna play
that again, like old times?

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.633 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 6C]
Haven't seen him around.

00:09:56.388 --> 00:09:58.056 position:50% align:center
Who is she?

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.768 position:50% align:center
I'd like a royal milk tea.

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:04.562 position:50% align:center
Your wish is my command,
Princess Marielle.

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:05.939 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 6A]
Princess?

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:10.151 position:50% align:center
You must be the princess that
got driven out of the capital.

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:12.737 position:50% align:center
To think we're actually in
the presence of Her Highness.

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:15.699 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, no!
We're just playing.

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:18.910 position:50% align:center
It's terrible.

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:21.705 position:50% align:center
We want to keep our loved ones
safe from the monsters.

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:24.040 position:50% align:center
However, the taxes
imposed by the church

00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:26.209 position:50% align:center
make it hard to do anything!

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:27.711 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 6C]
At this rate, the whole island

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:29.838 position:50% align:center
will be wiped out before long.

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:32.465 position:50% align:center
We need hope! Juin needs hope!

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:34.300 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:35.635 position:50% align:center
We heard you!

00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:37.804 position:50% align:center
You referred to this girl
as Princess Marielle!

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:40.056 position:50% align:center
Well, uh, actually...

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.266 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Jim.

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:45.937 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
I had no idea how overblown

00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:48.481 position:50% align:center
our little charade would become.

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:50.817 position:50% align:center
Before I knew it,
word that Princess Marielle

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.028 position:50% align:center
was leading a revolt
against the Orthodox Church

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:56.239 position:50% align:center
spread beyond the island
to other parts of the kingdom.

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.783 position:50% align:center
And then people
began to gather here.

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:01.745 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] By which point,
you were already committed.

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:03.913 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Mm-hm.

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:05.623 position:50% align:center
I don't want to
continue this lie.

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:07.000 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:10.712 position:50% align:center
That said, I also don't want
to disappoint everyone.

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:13.715 position:50% align:center
So, how can I fix this?

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:17.010 position:50% align:center
Now that I know the story,
I feel bad, moru.

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:20.513 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] It's all right, Marie.
I'm going to help you.

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:22.474 position:50% align:center
We'll get through this together.

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:25.643 position:50% align:center
What's the deal?

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:26.936 position:50% align:center
Thought you were
ready to lock 'er up

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.646 position:50% align:center
and throw away the key.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.066 position:50% align:center
She's been denying
who she truly is,

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:33.818 position:50% align:center
and the weight of that
is suffocating her.

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:34.944 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Marie.

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:37.364 position:50% align:center
You need to assemble
your followers

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:38.698 position:50% align:center
and let them know who you are.

00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:41.534 position:50% align:center
What? And why should
that be her next step?

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:43.703 position:50% align:center
So, she won't become
a target of the witch hunt.

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:46.164 position:50% align:center
You're not thinking of
the consequences, though!

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:48.667 position:50% align:center
A lot of people have
put their hope in her!

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.918 position:50% align:center
That's a valid point.

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:51.169 position:50% align:center
If you destroy people's hope,

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:53.296 position:50% align:center
they'll turn on you
in an instant.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.840 position:50% align:center
Nothing good comes from
hiding one's true self.

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:56.883 position:50% align:center
From spreading lies.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:58.134 position:50% align:center
I know you're right.

00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:02.347 position:50% align:center
Lies have consequences,
too! But, still--

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.391 position:50% align:center
"But still" what?

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:07.394 position:50% align:center
[JIM] Marie! I don't think
I can stop them!

00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:08.395 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Jim!

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:10.271 position:50% align:center
Wait, who the hell
are you people?

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:12.190 position:50% align:center
Get away from Princess Marielle!

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:14.567 position:50% align:center
--What's all this?
--Looks like intruders!

00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:16.695 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:19.698 position:50% align:center
[JIM]
Marie!

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:38.758 position:50% align:center
[screeches]

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:43.138 position:50% align:center
My comrades and I have
no wish to fight you!

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:44.347 position:50% align:center
Pretty hard to believe.

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:46.808 position:50% align:center
Since you're clearly
the church's minions!

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:50.895 position:50% align:center
You came to arrest her, yeah?

00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:53.314 position:50% align:center
Which means you
can't leave here alive!

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:55.692 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
If I possessed your skill level,

00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:58.153 position:50% align:center
I'd choose less
threatening words.

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:01.031 position:50% align:center
Shut up! I will
protect her with my life.

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:03.283 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
You still don't get it, do you?

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:04.534 position:50% align:center
Get what?

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:06.911 position:50% align:center
Marie doesn't like lying
and hiding who she is.

00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:07.746 position:50% align:center
She hates it!

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:08.955 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:19.924 position:50% align:center
I believe that
we'll be safe here.

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:21.176 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Good.

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:25.096 position:50% align:center
So, earlier,
you said you would help.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.058 position:50% align:center
But I don't understand
why you would even want to.

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:31.436 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] Let's just say
I can kinda relate.

00:13:32.354 --> 00:13:34.439 position:50% align:center
Heh. You know,
'cause name's Marius,

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:36.232 position:50% align:center
which sounds a lot like Marie.

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:37.859 position:50% align:center
Okay, but more importantly,

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:39.694 position:50% align:center
what's up with
that Jim guy, huh?

00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:41.946 position:50% align:center
You said the two of you
are childhood pals.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.699 position:50% align:center
But why does he keep fueling
the lie despite how you feel?

00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:46.534 position:50% align:center
'Cause he's incorrigible!

00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:48.286 position:50% align:center
Not true!

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:49.662 position:50% align:center
That's backwards.

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:52.415 position:50% align:center
Jim thinks about me more than
anyone else I know.

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:55.168 position:50% align:center
The reason I even began this act

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:57.253 position:50% align:center
was because of
what he did for me.

00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:59.005 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:02.425 position:50% align:center
Back then, it felt like
all I ever did was cry.

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:05.512 position:50% align:center
A definitive trait of
most orphans, I suppose.

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:08.056 position:50% align:center
[MARIE crying]

00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:10.684 position:50% align:center
[JIM]
Come on, Marie. Don't cry.

00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:13.144 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:14.604 position:50% align:center
I have an idea!

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:17.232 position:50% align:center
Let's play make-believe
for a little while!

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:43.800 position:50% align:center
[JIM] You look pretty,
as always, Princess Marielle.

00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:49.973 position:50% align:center
Why, thank you, Captain Jim
of the Royal Order!

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:53.435 position:50% align:center
It's amazing how much a smile
brightens up your face!

00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:57.689 position:50% align:center
[JIM] I'll protect that smile
forever and ever.

00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:01.484 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Suddenly it all makes sense.

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:03.278 position:50% align:center
Your big game of
"princess and knight" began

00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:05.780 position:50% align:center
as a little game
to make Marie happy.

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:10.326 position:50% align:center
Okay, then. So why is she
still playing the part?

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:11.953 position:50% align:center
Because of our army.

00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:13.204 position:50% align:center
'Cause of how
the Orthodox Church

00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:15.957 position:50% align:center
has been oppressing
those people.

00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:19.669 position:50% align:center
To our volunteers, the princess
is the very essence of hope.

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:22.380 position:50% align:center
You can't expect us to
take that away from them.

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:27.177 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Is your army what
you honestly want to protect?

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.720 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:31.473 position:50% align:center
You're allowing the one
closest to you to suffer.

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:32.682 position:50% align:center
All for their sake.

00:15:32.766 --> 00:15:34.142 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:36.853 position:50% align:center
So, you see.

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
We've become good friends with

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:40.565 position:50% align:center
the people in
the volunteer army.

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:44.444 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] If they find out
we've been lying to them...

00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:48.740 position:50% align:center
Actually, I know what you mean.

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:51.242 position:50% align:center
I'm keeping something
from my friends, too.

00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:54.621 position:50% align:center
[gasps] No way!
What are you hiding?

00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:56.456 position:50% align:center
Oh! Please forget I said that!

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:58.124 position:50% align:center
Why would you tell me a secret

00:15:58.208 --> 00:16:00.710 position:50% align:center
you can't even
tell your friends?

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:02.253 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] Not being
honest with the people

00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:04.881 position:50% align:center
you care most about
in the world...

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:07.258 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:10.553 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
...is harder than anything.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.309 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
I've made up my mind!

00:16:16.393 --> 00:16:17.894 position:50% align:center
I'll do it!
I'll tell 'em the truth

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:19.437 position:50% align:center
and show 'em the real me!

00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:20.522 position:50% align:center
You sure?

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:21.773 position:50% align:center
I'll explain it to Jim first,

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:22.982 position:50% align:center
but I just know
he'll feel the same!

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:24.943 position:50% align:center
[JIM]
Marie!

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:26.486 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Jim!

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:27.862 position:50% align:center
I had a feeling you'd be here.

00:16:27.946 --> 00:16:30.073 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] Listen, I kinda
came up with a plan.

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:32.784 position:50% align:center
Me, too. I say we
tell everyone the truth.

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:35.036 position:50% align:center
[MARIE gasps]
Really?

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.872 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It'll work out somehow.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:42.085 position:50% align:center
So, would you care to
break the news? Together?

00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:51.928 position:50% align:center
