[ROY] So, the Royal Order
and Ecclesiastical Order

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:16.891 position:50% align:center
have come to blows?

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:18.059 position:50% align:center
[CAMELLIAN MESSENGER 9A]
That's correct.

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:20.395 position:50% align:center
Squad Five,
alongside Olivier's forces,

00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:24.024 position:50% align:center
was said to have taken up arms
to rescue a single witch.

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:25.650 position:50% align:center
A witch?

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.278 position:50% align:center
Princess Marielle, Roy.

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:31.322 position:50% align:center
Think. Why else would
Adelheid mobilize troops?

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:33.074 position:50% align:center
It's only logical.

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:34.826 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:37.495 position:50% align:center
[RUGIS]
The time is ripe.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:38.747 position:50% align:center
This may be a turning point

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.458 position:50% align:center
that goes down in
Hortensia's history.

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:48.840 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID] As word that
Princess Marielle still lives

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:50.342 position:50% align:center
spreads throughout the kingdom,

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:53.470 position:50% align:center
more anti-church factions
will rise up in revolt.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:56.097 position:50% align:center
Like a wave washing
over the land.

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:57.891 position:50% align:center
In light of the situation,

00:00:57.974 --> 00:00:59.976 position:50% align:center
our castle will become
a stronghold.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.312 position:50% align:center
A safe haven for
those who choose

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:04.606 position:50% align:center
to stand by Princess Marielle.

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.649 position:50% align:center
You men must go out
and tell these people

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.986 position:50% align:center
they'll find sanctuary and
like-minded comrades here.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.697 position:50% align:center
Oliver will gladly welcome them!

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:13.990 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER SOLDIERS]
Right!

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:19.412 position:50% align:center
And, while we're at it, let's
send to Albert for the princess.

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:22.749 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID]
Yes. But before we do.

00:01:22.832 --> 00:01:24.834 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's wrong?

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:29.297 position:50% align:center
This war's not over.
It's just begun.

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:32.926 position:50% align:center
It'll take much more than
sovereign authority to triumph.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:38.807 position:50% align:center
Soon. The time is
close at hand now.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:43.812 position:50% align:center
[LACROIX] I have to assess
Marielle Le Hortensia.

00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:19.824 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA]
In you go.

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:22.911 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Can't believe they're
planning to head out again,

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:25.622 position:50% align:center
even though everyone
only just returned.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.500 position:50% align:center
But this time--

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:31.628 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.214 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE gasps]

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:36.299 position:50% align:center
Why are you walking
backwards like that?

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:40.637 position:50% align:center
Uh, exercise? I see you're
busy packing again.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.348 position:50% align:center
Huh? What're you
making that face for?

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:47.060 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA]
Really? Because I'm anxious!

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:49.854 position:50% align:center
I've been worried out of my mind
for every single one of you!

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:51.731 position:50% align:center
Oh. Sorry.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:54.109 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA] After hearing
you were all taken prisoner,

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:56.111 position:50% align:center
I was beside myself
with joy upon

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:58.196 position:50% align:center
seeing you safely back at home.

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:01.825 position:50% align:center
But now you're off to
yet another great battle.

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.994 position:50% align:center
The truth about Marius
is also a lot to take in.

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:08.206 position:50% align:center
He was actually a she this
entire time. A princess!

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center
I know what you mean! I'm
all kinds of awkward around her!

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:15.797 position:50% align:center
Well, that's because you haven't
owned up to it yet, right?

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.215 position:50% align:center
Up to what?

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:19.843 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Princess Marielle.

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:21.761 position:50% align:center
Until word arrives
from Adelheid,

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:24.389 position:50% align:center
we must bide our time
here in Albert.

00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:28.727 position:50% align:center
Oh. Is something the matter?

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:32.105 position:50% align:center
Are you feeling unwell,
Princess?

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:35.191 position:50% align:center
No. I'm fine.
Better than normal, actually.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.402 position:50% align:center
It's just, I don't believe
I'll ever get used to

00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:39.738 position:50% align:center
you calling me a princess.

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:42.198 position:50% align:center
But it's your proper title,
Your Highness.

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.576 position:50% align:center
Given time, it's how
everyone shall address you.

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.870 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE] No! That's not
what I'm talking about!

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.246 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:49.581 position:50% align:center
It's one thing for the people
to call me a princess,

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.916 position:50% align:center
but when you do it,
it's plain weird!

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.085 position:50% align:center
Oh! I, uh...

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.379 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I can already
tell I'm only gonna get

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:58.423 position:50% align:center
increasingly annoyed by this.

00:04:58.506 --> 00:04:59.549 position:50% align:center
Scrap the title.

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:01.426 position:50% align:center
Call me "Marius,"
and be done with it!

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.345 position:50% align:center
Treat me the way
you always have!

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:05.847 position:50% align:center
Um. But you're a
member of royalty.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.183 position:50% align:center
To impudently
disrespect you like that.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:09.225 position:50% align:center
I don't care!

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.977 position:50% align:center
In fact, drop all
the formalities!

00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:12.812 position:50% align:center
No. That's not
something I can do.

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:15.023 position:50% align:center
It's okay if I'm
the one saying so!

00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:16.191 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:17.400 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
The sooner you stop fighting,

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:19.527 position:50% align:center
the sooner this
will all be over!

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:21.571 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Fine! Now let go!

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:26.993 position:50% align:center
So, Princess Marielle,

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:29.621 position:50% align:center
I pray that this day finds you
happy and healthy.

00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:32.582 position:50% align:center
Is Deflotte tongue-tied?
Cute, moru!

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:35.001 position:50% align:center
Well. You can't
blame him, can you?

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:36.336 position:50% align:center
He's unknowingly been very rude

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.130 position:50% align:center
to the last person
you'd want to insult.

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:41.549 position:50% align:center
Now. You have
a decision to make.

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:44.260 position:50% align:center
This man has been faithless
and irreverent toward you,

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:46.971 position:50% align:center
Your Highness, for more days
than I care to count.

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:48.807 position:50% align:center
What would you like
to do with him?

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.058 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:52.435 position:50% align:center
I think a punishment
is definitely in order.

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.814 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE gasps]
I beg of you to have mercy!

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.442 position:50% align:center
Deflotte Danois of Petale.

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:01.653 position:50% align:center
As punishment for
the disdain you've shown,

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.196 position:50% align:center
you will hereby
serve as a knight

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:05.490 position:50% align:center
and join Alfred
in protecting me.

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:06.825 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:09.828 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE chuckles]
Well, what do you know?

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:11.329 position:50% align:center
Dreams can come true,
because you're

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:13.581 position:50% align:center
officially invested as
a knight, my friend.

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:14.791 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:17.502 position:50% align:center
So, you have no choice
but to stay by my side.

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:18.795 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Huh?

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:21.214 position:50% align:center
The way that you perceive me
may have changed.

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:24.551 position:50% align:center
But I'd like to believe
that our friendship hasn't.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.512 position:50% align:center
Princess Marielle.

00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:32.267 position:50% align:center
All right. I accept
this sentence.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.144 position:50% align:center
I, Deflotte Danois of Petale,

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:36.980 position:50% align:center
pledge to keep you safe,
no matter what happens!

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:38.231 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:41.067 position:50% align:center
Moru!

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:42.819 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] Although,
considering the current state

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:45.613 position:50% align:center
of the kingdom, your investiture
doesn't mean much.

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:48.533 position:50% align:center
Don't get lazy on me.
The battles ahead will be tough.

00:06:48.616 --> 00:06:50.160 position:50% align:center
So, fight for all you're worth!

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:51.703 position:50% align:center
Well, of course!

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:54.205 position:50% align:center
I know the enemy we're
facing now is the church.

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.000 position:50% align:center
But I'll be damned if I
let them hurt the princess!

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:59.669 position:50% align:center
Gotta say, I do
admire your spirit.

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:02.255 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] I'm just raring
to go. When do we leave?

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.215 position:50% align:center
Once we receive
word from Olivier.

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:06.718 position:50% align:center
Alrighty! That means
it could be any day!

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.178 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE laughs]

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:09.929 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:12.682 position:50% align:center
I'll accompany you
this time, if that's okay!

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:14.059 position:50% align:center
Nonnoria.

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:15.769 position:50% align:center
Where'd this come from?

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:18.063 position:50% align:center
I have always stayed
behind and waited.

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:19.522 position:50% align:center
I've stood and watched
your carriage leave

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:21.900 position:50% align:center
more times than I can bear.

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:24.903 position:50% align:center
Because I never know for certain
that you'll be coming back.

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:27.447 position:50% align:center
I worry the whole
time you're gone!

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.034 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I cannot tolerate
waiting around another day!

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:33.661 position:50% align:center
But it's not just any fight.

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:36.247 position:50% align:center
This next battle will be
on a whole other level.

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.375 position:50% align:center
Although we'll need
a supply corps,

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:40.460 position:50% align:center
I can't guarantee your safety.

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
That's amazing.

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:51.554 position:50% align:center
She's got skills.

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:52.722 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA]
While you were out and about

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:54.265 position:50% align:center
fighting monsters and whatnot,

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:56.476 position:50% align:center
Maurice has been
giving me archery lessons.

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:59.938 position:50% align:center
Which is why I'm confident
I can fight by your side!

00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:03.692 position:50% align:center
She's demonstrated her
conviction and craft.

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:04.776 position:50% align:center
So why not?

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:07.946 position:50% align:center
I will be her personal
bodyguard, moru!

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:11.199 position:50% align:center
All right then.

00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:14.661 position:50% align:center
Nonnoria, we could
use your help.

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:18.164 position:50% align:center
All right! You just
tell me where to shoot!

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:19.958 position:50% align:center
I appreciate your contribution.

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:21.418 position:50% align:center
But I want you to
promise me you'll always

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.586 position:50% align:center
put your safety
before anything else.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.464 position:50% align:center
Yes. Of course.
I promise you.

00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:27.632 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.676 position:50% align:center
Princess Marielle!

00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:33.847 position:50% align:center
If your aim's as true as true
as your heart, you'll be fine.

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:37.726 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you.
Protect her.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:39.602 position:50% align:center
You got it, moru!

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:41.855 position:50% align:center
Princess Marielle!

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:44.691 position:50% align:center
This soldier came bearing
a letter from Oliver!

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:52.157 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
Hey, Adelheid!

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.783 position:50% align:center
Why'd your summons
request we meet you

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:55.035 position:50% align:center
all the way out here
in the sticks?

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:56.786 position:50% align:center
She picked this scenery because

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.913 position:50% align:center
she knew I'd be
guarding the princess.

00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:01.416 position:50% align:center
It's a very subtle way of
asking me on a date!

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:04.044 position:50% align:center
I apologize for making you
travel such a distance.

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:05.128 position:50% align:center
I know it's tough.

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.629 position:50% align:center
Completely ignored.

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:08.548 position:50% align:center
The distance is not our concern.

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:10.592 position:50% align:center
But your priorities
at this time are.

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:13.428 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't we be gathering our
forces and prepping for war?

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:16.639 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID]
Yes. But first thing's first.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.060 position:50% align:center
Beyond here,
there's someone I'd like

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:22.354 position:50% align:center
the princess to
be acquainted with.

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:34.574 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE, NONNORIA]
A child?

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:37.744 position:50% align:center
Um, I was informed I
need to meet somebody here.

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:39.371 position:50% align:center
Would that be you?

00:09:41.873 --> 00:09:43.667 position:50% align:center
Greetings, Princess Marielle.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.002 position:50% align:center
The affront I'm about to
commit may alarm you.

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.504 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me.

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:48.797 position:50% align:center
What?

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:56.471 position:50% align:center
What'd you do?

00:09:56.554 --> 00:10:00.850 position:50% align:center
Wait. I assure you she means
no harm to the princess.

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:05.355 position:50% align:center
I do believe you.

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:08.650 position:50% align:center
But you mind explaining
exactly who this girl is?

00:10:09.693 --> 00:10:11.319 position:50% align:center
Her name is Lacroix.

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.407 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID]
And she's a witch.

00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:21.162 position:50% align:center
[ÉLÉANORE chuckles]
I knew you'd be in here.

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:22.288 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE]
Huh?

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:24.290 position:50% align:center
You're the only one
who's missing now.

00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:29.379 position:50% align:center
Come, we don't want to keep our
guests waiting do we, Marielle?

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:31.881 position:50% align:center
Right! Thank you, Mother!

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.272 position:50% align:center
You're positive she's
not in any pain, right?

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:50.066 position:50% align:center
I understand your concern,
but she's not in danger.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.609 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA]
Okay.

00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:54.029 position:50% align:center
So. You called this
young girl a witch,

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:55.155 position:50% align:center
but what does that mean?

00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:56.448 position:50% align:center
Aren't they fake?

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:58.575 position:50% align:center
A mere pretext the
Orthodox Church came up with

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.785 position:50% align:center
to get rid of those
they deem inconvenient?

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:02.829 position:50% align:center
That's what I thought, at least.

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:05.915 position:50% align:center
Yes, I used to think
the same thing.

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:08.043 position:50% align:center
Then I happened upon Lacroix.

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
She wasn't always
forced to hide.

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:14.507 position:50% align:center
There was a time she traversed
the kingdom selling medicine.

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:16.509 position:50% align:center
Her wares worked a bit too well.

00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:19.137 position:50% align:center
People claimed the effects
were almost magical.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.182 position:50% align:center
And when she drew the attention
of the Orthodox Church,

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:23.516 position:50% align:center
she took shelter in Olivier.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.893 position:50% align:center
Lemme get this straight.

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:27.479 position:50% align:center
Witches are just people
who make medicine?

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:30.148 position:50% align:center
No. Being a healer
was a disguise

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:32.776 position:50% align:center
to conceal my true identity.

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:38.490 position:50% align:center
If you really must know.
We're Magonian sentinels.

00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:40.867 position:50% align:center
There are powers spoken of
in tales of old,

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.536 position:50% align:center
and we have knowledge
of every last one.

00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:47.791 position:50% align:center
[COURT]
It's so good to see you!

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:51.378 position:50% align:center
Happy birthday!
And may you have many more!

00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:55.423 position:50% align:center
You sure took
your time, Marielle.

00:11:55.507 --> 00:11:57.258 position:50% align:center
Then again, it is
your special day,

00:11:57.342 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center
so you can arrive
at your leisure.

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:01.096 position:50% align:center
Thanks for coming, everyone!

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:04.516 position:50% align:center
[COURT gasps]

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:07.977 position:50% align:center
Hard to believe the princess
is already six years old.

00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:13.066 position:50% align:center
Princess. You have
your fair mother's grace.

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:14.943 position:50% align:center
Yet you're still so young.

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:16.152 position:50% align:center
Not for long, though.

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:19.072 position:50% align:center
She'll be all grown up
in the blink of an eye.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:20.573 position:50% align:center
You know something?

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:22.659 position:50% align:center
My son is training
to become a knight.

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.786 position:50% align:center
And when his hard work pays off,

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:26.913 position:50% align:center
perhaps he'll have
the same honor I have

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:29.207 position:50% align:center
and be assigned to
protect you, Princess.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.835 position:50% align:center
[LEON] Hold on. Are we
making future plans?

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:34.671 position:50% align:center
For my daughter's been
busy training as well.

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:37.757 position:50% align:center
Lately, she's become even
more proficient with a spear.

00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center
From what I've seen
of her abilities,

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.511 position:50% align:center
she would make a fine
knight for you, Princess.

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:43.555 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID gasps]
Oh, Father!

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:47.183 position:50% align:center
Adelheid! You'd really be
okay with protecting me?

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:49.269 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID] Much more
than okay, Your Highness.

00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:50.645 position:50% align:center
It'd be an honor.

00:12:50.729 --> 00:12:52.272 position:50% align:center
Even if I'm not assigned
as your knight,

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:54.065 position:50% align:center
I'll still protect you.

00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:56.526 position:50% align:center
My, how nice! Isn't it?

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:57.777 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:01.573 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE] My birthday wish
is that life will go on

00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:04.284 position:50% align:center
just like this,
forever and ever!

00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:07.120 position:50% align:center
[ÉLÉANORE]
Indeed. I hope so, too.

00:13:12.334 --> 00:13:17.422 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE crying]
I'll take care of Charlot.

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:20.800 position:50% align:center
So don't cry because
we'll both be fine.

00:13:20.884 --> 00:13:24.137 position:50% align:center
[ÉLÉANORE]
Thank you, Marielle.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.015 position:50% align:center
Having you for a daughter
makes me happier

00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:29.059 position:50% align:center
than you'll ever know.

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Mother!

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.692 position:50% align:center
Don't do this to me.

00:13:37.776 --> 00:13:41.613 position:50% align:center
Don't leave me in a world
without you, Éléanore!

00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:44.908 position:50% align:center
Come back to me!

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:48.828 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON]
Now, Your Majesty.

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:52.082 position:50% align:center
Concentrate on the relic
as hard as you are able.

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:55.627 position:50% align:center
Focus on your wishes.
Your desires.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.630 position:50% align:center
I wonder what's going on.

00:13:58.713 --> 00:14:00.757 position:50% align:center
[LACROIX]
I see. The king was trying to

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.676 position:50% align:center
bring the queen back to life.

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.302 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:04.386 --> 00:14:07.806 position:50% align:center
[LACROIX] Something capable of
making any wish come true.

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:10.475 position:50% align:center
That's what the relic is.

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:13.645 position:50% align:center
Pure Magonian power
resides within.

00:14:13.728 --> 00:14:16.314 position:50% align:center
That's the relic?

00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:17.774 position:50% align:center
[LACROIX]
I haven't a clue when it first

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:19.859 position:50% align:center
came to exist in this world.

00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:22.404 position:50% align:center
But if you manage to
control its awesome power,

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:26.449 position:50% align:center
you can realize the most
outrageous wishes imaginable.

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:28.993 position:50% align:center
Even bringing
the dead back to life.

00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:32.706 position:50% align:center
Or creating your ideal world,
right down to every last part.

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:35.208 position:50% align:center
It can do that?

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:37.085 position:50% align:center
[LACROIX] The prior king
and Pope Vall D'Hebron

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:39.546 position:50% align:center
both had large
appetites for power.

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:41.006 position:50% align:center
And once they
acquired the relic,

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:42.716 position:50% align:center
they hoped to gain
knowledge concerning

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:46.094 position:50% align:center
Magonian magic to further
satisfy their hunger.

00:14:46.177 --> 00:14:49.097 position:50% align:center
They were also searching
for witches just like me.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.933 position:50% align:center
So that's the story behind
those unfounded hunts.

00:14:52.017 --> 00:14:56.021 position:50% align:center
[LACROIX] Yes. Magonian power
is incredibly vast.

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:57.689 position:50% align:center
You've seen it yourself
if you've encountered

00:14:57.772 --> 00:14:59.649 position:50% align:center
the monsters
throughout the land,

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:02.193 position:50% align:center
for it's what suddenly
brought them here.

00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:03.778 position:50% align:center
Such a shame.

00:15:03.862 --> 00:15:06.990 position:50% align:center
The king's fascination with this
power caused so much tragedy.

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:08.324 position:50% align:center
If he'd just let it go,

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:10.452 position:50% align:center
many tears would never
have been shed.

00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:12.037 position:50% align:center
What tragedy is that?

it's not too late to make
a wish upon the relic.

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:48.782 position:50% align:center
You could get back
the world you desire

Through Magonian power,

you could lead

00:16:51.428 --> 00:16:53.346 position:50% align:center
We have our own power,
and we'll do

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.932 position:50% align:center
what needs to be done
with that alone!

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:04.065 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Princess Marielle!

00:17:04.149 --> 00:17:06.735 position:50% align:center
What a relief, moru!

00:17:06.818 --> 00:17:08.361 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys.

00:17:10.572 --> 00:17:14.284 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED gasps] Pardon me. I was
just trying to calm you down.

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:16.244 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.125 position:50% align:center
I apologize for
putting you through that.

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:23.626 position:50% align:center
Incredibly so.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.338 position:50% align:center
Such a violation is
highly inappropriate.

00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:29.382 position:50% align:center
No, please. It's nothing
you need to worry about.

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:32.177 position:50% align:center
What's more concerning is
the relic's whereabouts.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.679 position:50% align:center
It's in Pope Vall
D'Hebron's possession.

00:17:34.763 --> 00:17:36.264 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:38.683 position:50% align:center
If he has that kind of
power at his disposal,

00:17:38.767 --> 00:17:40.185 position:50% align:center
then we're in danger.

00:17:40.268 --> 00:17:41.686 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE]
I know.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.773 position:50% align:center
Which is why we'll devise
a plan to get it away from him!

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:46.232 position:50% align:center
Princess Marielle?

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:49.027 position:50% align:center
It's my duty to watch over
all things Magonia,

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.571 position:50% align:center
and you successfully
passed my trial.

00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:54.866 position:50% align:center
Find the relic, and it
will not enchant you.

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:56.534 position:50% align:center
I've no doubt you'll
keep a clear head

00:17:56.618 --> 00:17:59.537 position:50% align:center
and make the correct decisions
when they need to be made.

00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:03.500 position:50% align:center
Yeah. When I finally come face-
to-face with Pope Vall D'Hebron,

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:05.877 position:50% align:center
I will personally
secure the relic.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.713 position:50% align:center
That said, I'd greatly
appreciate some assistance.

00:18:08.797 --> 00:18:09.923 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Right!

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:11.174 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.972 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
Now we can start getting ready

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:19.516 position:50% align:center
to liberate the capital.

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:21.851 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID] Yes. Consider
yourselves cordially invited

00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:23.687 position:50% align:center
to Oliver's Dominion.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.815 position:50% align:center
Aw, yeah! Now I'm excited!

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:30.944 position:50% align:center
Even now, you still
call me Marius.

00:18:31.027 --> 00:18:32.320 position:50% align:center
What?

00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:35.865 position:50% align:center
Back there. Didn't you
call out to me at some point?

00:18:35.949 --> 00:18:37.242 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Marius!

00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:40.120 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:44.207 position:50% align:center
Seriously, though.
It's easier for us both.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.501 position:50% align:center
I really want you to
call me Marius.

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:52.924 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Okay, Marius.
But only when no one's around.

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:54.217 position:50% align:center
Deal.

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:56.886 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:00.807 position:50% align:center
[THERESIA gasps]

00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:05.061 position:50% align:center
[RUGIS]
Theresia?

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:07.731 position:50% align:center
[THERESIA]
I had a premonition!

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:09.566 position:50% align:center
What did you see?

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:12.485 position:50% align:center
Sure enough. It's the
princess and her faction.

00:19:12.569 --> 00:19:16.072 position:50% align:center
They're making plans to invade
the capital and seize the relic.

00:19:16.156 --> 00:19:18.867 position:50% align:center
And if they do,
you-know-who will...

00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:23.580 position:50% align:center
I'm going to make my way to
the capital, too, Lord Rugis!

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:24.664 position:50% align:center
Maybe--

00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:27.250 position:50% align:center
You're spent.

00:19:27.334 --> 00:19:29.210 position:50% align:center
That vision must've
drained your energy.

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:31.254 position:50% align:center
You'll remain here.

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:32.213 position:50% align:center
No.

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:34.549 position:50% align:center
I'll handle the rest.

00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:43.058 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE]
Valiant comrades of Hortensia!

00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:45.101 position:50% align:center
The time has come at last!

00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:46.853 position:50% align:center
Not to usurp the throne.

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:49.230 position:50% align:center
Nor to lash out in vengeance!

00:19:49.314 --> 00:19:50.732 position:50% align:center
We have a greater goal.

00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:53.151 position:50% align:center
As the Liberation Army,
our main objective

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:55.779 position:50% align:center
is to save the people
of the kingdom!

00:19:55.862 --> 00:19:57.739 position:50% align:center
Loyal and trusted knights.

00:19:57.822 --> 00:19:59.032 position:50% align:center
Beloved friends.

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:00.325 position:50% align:center
It's a dark path ahead,

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:03.787 position:50% align:center
but I will be the torch
that guides you!

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.289 position:50% align:center
Follow my sword and
its brilliant light!

00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:07.415 position:50% align:center
Before it, lies the road

00:20:07.499 --> 00:20:10.627 position:50% align:center
that leads to peace
for all Hortensia!

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.379 position:50% align:center
Now, we fight!

00:20:12.462 --> 00:20:15.632 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS cheer]

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:16.800 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 9A]
Let's take the kingdom back

00:20:16.883 --> 00:20:18.968 position:50% align:center
from the Orthodox Church!

00:20:19.052 --> 00:20:21.638 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 9B] In the name of
Princess Marielle!

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:27.477 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
You surprised me.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.895 position:50% align:center
To think the charming Marius was

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:31.189 position:50% align:center
the genuine princess
in disguise.

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:32.649 position:50% align:center
Jim! Marie!

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:34.150 position:50% align:center
I can't express
how much it means to me

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:36.027 position:50% align:center
you both joined
the Liberation Army.

00:20:36.111 --> 00:20:37.487 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Well, of course, silly!

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.406 position:50% align:center
I told you I'd come running
to the princess's aid

00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:41.324 position:50% align:center
if trouble reared its ugly head.

00:20:41.408 --> 00:20:43.827 position:50% align:center
We're here to help
in any way that we can.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.413 position:50% align:center
Even if that help involves
taking the capital.

00:20:46.496 --> 00:20:50.166 position:50% align:center
Wuh-ho! Well now.
This some turnout or what?

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:54.045 position:50% align:center
Yes. Thanks to the princess's
popularity, no doubt.

00:20:54.129 --> 00:21:00.010 position:50% align:center
Huh? I haven't seen Old Man
Balthauser among our ranks.

00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:02.971 position:50% align:center
Well. He never
replied to my message.

00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:05.724 position:50% align:center
And his whereabouts
are a complete mystery.

00:21:05.807 --> 00:21:07.142 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:24.200 position:50% align:center
The Racines River is
right up ahead, isn't it?

00:21:24.284 --> 00:21:27.412 position:50% align:center
Yeah. If the Ecclesiastical
Knights are going to engage us,

00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:29.789 position:50% align:center
then we're about to see
a whole bunch of them there.

00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:32.542 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Deflotte. Can you
swiftly alert the front line?

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:35.754 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Hey! On your right!

00:21:36.838 --> 00:21:38.965 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
Camellian troops!

00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:40.925 position:50% align:center
Why is Camellia here?

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.055 position:50% align:center
That blast!

00:21:46.056 --> 00:21:49.726 position:50% align:center
[ELVA] When the seeds of strife
are oh so close at hand...

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:53.188 position:50% align:center
[THALIA] It would be a waste to
just stand around and watch.

00:21:53.271 --> 00:21:55.440 position:50% align:center
Let's try and
destroy one another.

00:21:55.523 --> 00:21:57.609 position:50% align:center
Like they could kill us!

00:23:33.663 --> 00:23:34.956 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
You don't have to do this!

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.207 position:50% align:center
[ROY]
Don't push your luck.

00:23:36.291 --> 00:23:37.959 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] So destructive.
And the church has more.

00:23:38.043 --> 00:23:39.669 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL] I doubt there's
a story as perfect as this

00:23:39.753 --> 00:23:41.254 position:50% align:center
even in Magonian legends.

00:23:41.338 --> 00:23:42.589 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
I'll be counting on you.

00:23:42.672 --> 00:23:45.508 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL]
Do me a favor, Alfred Albert.
