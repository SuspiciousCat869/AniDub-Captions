00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:24.399 position:50% align:center
What's going on?
What do you need Marius for?

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:26.401 position:50% align:center
The idea of him being
a witch is a joke!

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:29.154 position:50% align:center
He's a boy, for crying out loud!
And a squire, at that!

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:31.906 position:50% align:center
[GUARD 8A] Quit your bellyaching
and get off the bars!

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:36.161 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
What the hell am I doing here?

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:38.663 position:50% align:center
I swore to protect my friends

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:41.583 position:50% align:center
and everything
that's dear to me.

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:42.834 position:50% align:center
[LUCAN]
What's all the racket?

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:44.794 position:50% align:center
Oh. Greetings, Commander Lucan.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.921 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Who?

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:52.052 position:50% align:center
So, you're the new
prisoner I heard about.

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:54.262 position:50% align:center
The lord in league with
the petridermic witch

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:55.889 position:50% align:center
and plotting a rebellion.

00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:57.599 position:50% align:center
Alfred Albert.

00:00:57.682 --> 00:01:00.268 position:50% align:center
It can't be. I know you!

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:03.563 position:50% align:center
You're the Royal Order's
Squad Five commander, Lucan!

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:05.065 position:50% align:center
But why visit us?

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:07.067 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Wait, is he an old buddy?

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.693 position:50% align:center
That's fantastic news!

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:10.737 position:50% align:center
You can release us
in light of your friendship!

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.781 position:50% align:center
[GUARD 8B] Now you're just
being ridiculous!

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:13.865 position:50% align:center
Why would the
captain of the guard

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:15.909 position:50% align:center
at this prison set you free?

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:19.120 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] Jeez. Is there
anything royal knights don't do?

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:21.998 position:50% align:center
Lucan, please. It's my friend.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.416 position:50% align:center
He's in grave danger right now,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.627 position:50% align:center
all because he was
falsely accused!

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.545 position:50% align:center
Please, help him!

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:28.505 position:50% align:center
No can do.

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:29.631 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED gasps]

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:31.966 position:50% align:center
Your "friend" is
sentenced to death.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.385 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:35.387 position:50% align:center
[LUCAN] You two will receive
sentences of your own

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.180 position:50% align:center
in the Tower of Justice.

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.140 position:50% align:center
Guards, ready them.

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:40.850 position:50% align:center
You know this isn't fair!

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.436 position:50% align:center
You see how unjust
this witch-hunt is!

00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:46.272 position:50% align:center
[LUCAN]
Take them away.

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:50.568 position:50% align:center
No, wait! Come back here!
You holier-than-thou mongrel!

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.154 position:50% align:center
Marius!

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:32.504 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] I knew full well
what Alfred was doing,

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:35.840 position:50% align:center
what he was trying to protect.

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:38.927 position:50% align:center
He wants to keep
everyone in Albert safe.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.637 position:50% align:center
Though some days
are harder than others,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.222 position:50% align:center
he never stops striving to be

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:45.141 position:50% align:center
the best lord
he can for his people.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.477 position:50% align:center
I understood all of that.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.855 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] Yet I still
selfishly dragged him

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.775 position:50% align:center
into the middle of my fight.

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:56.528 position:50% align:center
No! I didn't want things
to end up this way!

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:59.948 position:50% align:center
All I wanted was peace!
I'm just like Alfred!

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:03.243 position:50% align:center
I want to keep everybody
safe and happy!

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:04.494 position:50% align:center
[CHARLOT]
Are you really, though?

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:07.122 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE gasps]
Charlot?

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:10.000 position:50% align:center
[CHARLOT] Were you genuinely
trying to keep everyone safe?

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.335 position:50% align:center
Do you truly wish
for their happiness?

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.254 position:50% align:center
I've always tried to
put the kingdom first

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:16.339 position:50% align:center
for as long as I can remember.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:18.299 position:50% align:center
And I think of you the same way.

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.010 position:50% align:center
We both know that
the only person

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.803 position:50% align:center
you ever think of is yourself.

00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:23.388 position:50% align:center
No, you're wrong!

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.682 position:50% align:center
If it were for the sake of
protecting other people,

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:28.184 position:50% align:center
I would gladly lay down my life!

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:31.187 position:50% align:center
Oh? What's preventing you
from saving me, then?

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.939 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE gasps]

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:35.984 position:50% align:center
[CHARLOT] I've been locked up
inside this castle for years.

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:37.777 position:50% align:center
Alone and afraid.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.613 position:50% align:center
[CHARLOT] You say you want
peace for everybody,

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:42.615 position:50% align:center
yet you have no problem
letting others suffer

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.243 position:50% align:center
so you can enjoy your
own slice of paradise.

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:47.704 position:50% align:center
Wait. Charlot, I--

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:50.623 position:50% align:center
No. He's come again.

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.376 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.339 position:50% align:center
[CHARLOT] Why? Why won't
you save me, dear sister?

00:04:57.422 --> 00:05:02.594 position:50% align:center
Our father, Fernando,
and Leon are all dead.

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:07.891 position:50% align:center
Please come and
rescue me. I beg of you.

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:10.310 position:50% align:center
[CHARLOT]
Save me--!

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.608 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE]
Stop it. Just go away!

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:23.490 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 8A] Tell me, witch, are
there more of your ungodly kind?

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:26.201 position:50% align:center
And how do we lift
the petridermic curse?

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:32.290 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 8B] I guess she's
not in a very talkative mood.

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:33.124 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:36.211 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 8B chuckels]

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.131 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
That's quite enough.

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:41.549 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 8B]
Sir Didier!

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:46.388 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] Torturing her any
further will do us no good,

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:48.640 position:50% align:center
so I'll be taking
over from here.

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:49.933 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHTS]
Yes, sir.

00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:59.442 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] I am terribly sorry
for the harsh treatment

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:03.613 position:50% align:center
you've had to endure,
Princess Marielle.

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:23.425 position:50% align:center
Why, you!

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:28.763 position:50% align:center
Hey! You better have
some kinda plan!

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:30.140 position:50% align:center
We're rescuing Marius!

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:31.599 position:50% align:center
Wait. What?

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:33.852 position:50% align:center
They intend to execute him,
so I have to do something!

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:36.855 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] That part I get,
but can we really escape?

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:38.815 position:50% align:center
[GUARD 8C] What do you two
think you're doing?

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:40.734 position:50% align:center
Well, we'll find out!

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:46.364 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] Allow me to
apologize on behalf of my men

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:50.368 position:50% align:center
for their barbaric treatment
of you, Princess Marielle.

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:52.620 position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastical Knights
are useful pawns,

00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:54.247 position:50% align:center
but due to their ardent faith,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.418 position:50% align:center
they have a tendency to act
a bit, shall we say, fanatical.

00:06:58.501 --> 00:06:59.836 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS gasps]

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.338 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
It's hard to admit.

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:04.341 position:50% align:center
But I'm ashamed I did not
recognize you at first.

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:06.593 position:50% align:center
As a knight who has
long sworn allegiance

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:07.969 position:50% align:center
in service to the kingdom,

00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:11.097 position:50% align:center
it was a disgraceful
error on my part.

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:14.059 position:50% align:center
Those words do not
become a traitor!

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:15.810 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
Speaking of traitors.

00:07:15.894 --> 00:07:18.480 position:50% align:center
King Charlot has decreed
a rather severe punishment

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:20.648 position:50% align:center
for the witch bringing
the kingdom to ruin

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:22.192 position:50% align:center
with her sorcery.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:25.153 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] Only because the pope
told him to make such a decree!

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:26.488 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
Is it truly, though?

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:27.697 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:34.037 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
Unfortunately for you, princess.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.247 position:50% align:center
You will pay for the crime
of turning against us

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:37.916 position:50% align:center
with your life.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.879 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] That said, I think it
would be more than I could bear

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:46.132 position:50% align:center
to simply let you die
without knowing the truth.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:47.759 position:50% align:center
What truth?

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:51.221 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] This is the least
I can do to pay tribute.

00:07:56.226 --> 00:08:00.522 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Are these my memories?

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:03.024 position:50% align:center
The few traces I have of Mother?

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:11.282 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE crying]
I'll take care of Charlot.

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:16.121 position:50% align:center
So don't cry because
we'll both be fine.

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:19.499 position:50% align:center
[ÉLÉANORE]
Thank you, Marielle.

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:21.918 position:50% align:center
Having you for
a daughter makes me

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:24.212 position:50% align:center
happier than you'll ever know.

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:31.886 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Mother!

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:39.602 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Huh? What is this memory?

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:41.479 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON]
Now, Your Majesty.

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:44.691 position:50% align:center
Concentrate on the relic
as hard as you are able.

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:48.278 position:50% align:center
Focus on your wishes.
Your desires.

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:50.071 position:50% align:center
That's Mother.

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:52.866 position:50% align:center
I wonder what's going on.

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:55.994 position:50% align:center
You startled me.

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:57.996 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] This is no place
for a young princess

00:08:58.079 --> 00:09:00.206 position:50% align:center
to be wandering around.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.083 position:50% align:center
Do you know what they're doing?

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:04.210 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] His Majesty fell
into an extreme state

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:07.380 position:50% align:center
of grief after losing
Queen Éléanore.

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:09.799 position:50% align:center
He's endeavoring to
alleviate his sorrow by

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:12.093 position:50% align:center
offering a prayer that
might summon the queen

00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:14.220 position:50% align:center
back down from Heaven.

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:18.892 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE] I miss Mother,
too, with all my heart.

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:22.270 position:50% align:center
But, once people pass away,
they don't come back.

00:09:22.354 --> 00:09:24.314 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
That isn't entirely true.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.815 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:28.526 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] There is a great power
that exists in our world,

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:32.864 position:50% align:center
Princess, and it transcends
the laws of all creation.

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:40.872 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What was that?
And why'd I forget?

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:43.249 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] Because your
memories of that moment

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:46.711 position:50% align:center
were long since locked away
at my suggestion.

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:49.005 position:50% align:center
This power which you spoke of.

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:51.800 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] Your father was
captivated by it and wound up

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:55.428 position:50% align:center
committing a grave taboo
as a result of his fascination.

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:59.516 position:50% align:center
And he, along with his kingdom,
suffered the consequences.

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.309 position:50% align:center
Rugis's rebellion.

00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:04.604 position:50% align:center
The monsters that suddenly
started appearing in our world.

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:07.941 position:50% align:center
Your naïve younger brother
becoming a puppet of the pope.

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:10.610 position:50% align:center
Every last one of these
instances came to pass

00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:13.279 position:50% align:center
because of the
late king's actions.

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:18.660 position:50% align:center
You're lying. It can't be.

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:22.163 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] He wished to bring his
beloved wife back from the dead.

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:25.250 position:50% align:center
But all that arrogant fool
brought was misery and suffering

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:28.336 position:50% align:center
upon the innocent
people of Hortensia.

00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:31.381 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
Come to think of it.

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:34.759 position:50% align:center
Sanctions against Albert's
Dominion should be underway.

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:36.052 position:50% align:center
I suppose when it comes to

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:38.805 position:50% align:center
bringing misfortune
upon loyal subjects,

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:41.933 position:50% align:center
the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:43.893 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
Come.

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:45.228 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS gasps]

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.313 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] You have
one final act to perform,

00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:50.567 position:50% align:center
so please permit me
to escort you.

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:55.864 position:50% align:center
Damn!

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:58.491 position:50% align:center
[GUARD 8C] Surrender!
You have nowhere to run!

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.244 position:50% align:center
Just our luck.

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:03.580 position:50% align:center
[GUARD 8C groans]

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:07.375 position:50% align:center
Are they turning on each other?

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:09.461 position:50% align:center
Hey! Sorry I'm late.

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:11.546 position:50% align:center
Maurice? That means...

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:14.466 position:50% align:center
Here! Catch, moru!

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:20.930 position:50% align:center
[QOO]
Alfred, I'm so glad you're okay!

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:23.016 position:50% align:center
I was really worried, moru!

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Qoo. Thanks for coming.

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:27.437 position:50% align:center
Nice work, little guy!

00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:32.192 position:50% align:center
[GUARDS gasp]

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:33.777 position:50% align:center
They're going to kill Marius!

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.362 position:50% align:center
That's what I've heard.

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:36.613 position:50% align:center
If I had gotten here sooner,

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.698 position:50% align:center
they wouldn't even be
at the execution ground!

00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:40.158 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] Doesn't it strike
you as odd that they're

00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:42.452 position:50% align:center
in such a rush to
get rid of Marius?

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:45.080 position:50% align:center
And for being a witch,
of all things.

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:46.998 position:50% align:center
That's because...

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:50.585 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.257 position:50% align:center
This is as far as you shall go.

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:59.886 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE chuckles] Aren't you
a sight for sore eyes.

00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:01.596 position:50% align:center
I guess the stories were true.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.974 position:50% align:center
You've become an obedient
watchdog of the church.

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:08.561 position:50% align:center
Quite strong words from
someone as low as you.

00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:10.188 position:50% align:center
You're leading a prison break.

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:11.648 position:50% align:center
You think what I'm
doing is worse than

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:13.900 position:50% align:center
a royal knight
who's lost his pride?

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:16.194 position:50% align:center
Well, I don't see it that way!

00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center
So pathetically daft!

00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:23.868 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
What's the matter, Lucan?

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:26.413 position:50% align:center
Your spears seem
as misguided as you are.

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:28.581 position:50% align:center
Or are you just messing around?

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:31.710 position:50% align:center
Silence! You fled
after the revolt!

00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:32.711 position:50% align:center
Like a coward!

00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:35.547 position:50% align:center
You don't get to
talk down to me!

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.798 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:39.217 position:50% align:center
Now, the pope has seized
control of the throne

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.761 position:50% align:center
and the princess's life
was snuffed out.

00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:45.682 position:50% align:center
As such, I have no reason to
devote myself to the kingdom!

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.934 position:50% align:center
And you're in the same
sinking boat as me!

00:12:48.018 --> 00:12:50.562 position:50% align:center
Same sinking boat? No.

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:54.524 position:50% align:center
Not only do I still
have my pride,

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:57.569 position:50% align:center
but I also serve the one
to whom I swore my loyalty!

00:12:57.652 --> 00:12:59.029 position:50% align:center
[LUCAN]
What?

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:01.239 position:50% align:center
And if I weren't trying
to save that person,

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:03.283 position:50% align:center
you wouldn't be
talking to me now!

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:04.868 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED gasps]

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.415 position:50% align:center
Alfred! Take that
carriage and go!

00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:13.877 position:50% align:center
Please, rescue Marius!
It's all up to you!

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:27.599 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON] Hmm. So, Squad
Four is missing in action?

00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:30.060 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 8C] Yes. They were
exterminating monsters

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:31.603 position:50% align:center
when we lost contact.

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:34.147 position:50% align:center
Commander Bertrand's
status is unknown.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.900 position:50% align:center
I understand. You're dismissed.

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:38.109 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 8C]
Sir.

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:44.366 position:50% align:center
What a time for Olivier
to mobilize their army.

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:46.451 position:50% align:center
Though they claim
they're running drills.

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:48.244 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
A little too suspect.

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:51.414 position:50% align:center
It's possible they realized
who the witch actually is.

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:52.999 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON]
Didier.

00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:55.001 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] If that's indeed the
case, it's a clear declaration

00:13:55.085 --> 00:13:59.506 position:50% align:center
they've chosen to side with her
instead of the Orthodox Church.

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:01.049 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON]
Use whatever means necessary

00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:05.178 position:50% align:center
to dispose of them. That goes
for anyone who supports her!

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:09.015 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] Very well.
Please forgive my haste.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.351 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON gasps]

00:14:15.647 --> 00:14:17.982 position:50% align:center
That technique he used
is spatial shifting.

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:19.859 position:50% align:center
Straight out of the myth.

00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:23.113 position:50% align:center
My, he truly knows
no bounds, does he?

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:25.365 position:50% align:center
Someday, I'll see to him.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.086 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] I bring misery
to those around me,

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:41.756 position:50% align:center
and it feels like I'm
constantly being protected.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:46.052 position:50% align:center
I only managed to survive thanks
to the sacrifices of others.

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:50.473 position:50% align:center

So, this is for the best.

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:53.601 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
If I'm gone, then nobody else

00:14:53.685 --> 00:14:56.271 position:50% align:center
will be endangered for my sake.

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:04.946 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Marius was carrying
this burden the whole time.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.698 position:50% align:center
I knew there was
something going on,

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:08.908 position:50% align:center

to figure out what!

Everyone. I'm sorry.

00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:15.206 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] I could have
at least offered my hand.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.083 position:50% align:center
I could've done anything!

00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:20.295 position:50% align:center

Forgive me, Qoo and Charlot.

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:22.088 position:50% align:center
We won't meet again.

You'll free Marius!

think yourself a match for me?

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.197 position:50% align:center
That miscalculation
will be your downfall.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.532 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID]
Not today.

00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:38.118 position:50% align:center
I think you're the one
who miscalculated.

00:18:41.913 --> 00:18:45.250 position:50% align:center
Is this a better match?
Former comrade?

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:47.252 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
Adelheid.

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:49.921 position:50% align:center
Since the glory of Olivier
rests on my spear,

00:18:50.005 --> 00:18:52.465 position:50% align:center
I'll sear that
splendor into you!

00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:57.303 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 8A] Stop that fool!
Don't let him reach her!

00:18:57.387 --> 00:19:00.557 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] I don't think so.
Leave 'im alone!

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.142 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:19:02.225 --> 00:19:03.143 position:50% align:center
I'm here, Marius!

00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:04.269 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:06.521 --> 00:19:09.816 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 8A] You dare defy
the Orthodox Church, heretic?

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:18.074 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
If there's room for me,

00:19:18.158 --> 00:19:20.326 position:50% align:center
I'll gladly join the fray!

00:19:25.457 --> 00:19:27.125 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 8A] This witch'll
meet her death at my hands

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:28.877 position:50% align:center
if it's the last thing I do!

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.713 position:50% align:center
For Pope Vall D'Hebron!

00:19:32.964 --> 00:19:35.342 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 8A]
Now die!

00:19:36.426 --> 00:19:37.635 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:45.352 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] Looks like
it's time for us to part.

00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:47.103 position:50% align:center
[LUCAN]
What is that?

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:50.648 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Get back here!

00:19:56.613 --> 00:20:00.116 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED panting]

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:10.919 position:50% align:center
Why did you come?

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.756 position:50% align:center
Why would you risk
your life for mine?

00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:18.677 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Up until now, I deceived you.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.513 position:50% align:center
I caused nothing but despair.

00:20:21.596 --> 00:20:23.014 position:50% align:center
I don't deserve to live.

00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:25.850 position:50% align:center
Honestly. I should've died here!

00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:29.521 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't be so grim.

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:35.443 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter to me
who you are. Not at all.

00:20:35.527 --> 00:20:38.363 position:50% align:center
Because you're still
my precious family.

00:20:40.448 --> 00:20:45.078 position:50% align:center
Albert's waiting.
So, let's go home.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.142 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED gasps]
Marius.

00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:10.770 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] Listen.
Before another word is spoken,

00:21:10.854 --> 00:21:13.148 position:50% align:center
there's something
I need to tell you.

00:21:14.733 --> 00:21:20.155 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. Marius is--
That's not my name.

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:27.078 position:50% align:center
The name given to me at birth
was Marielle Le Hortensia.

00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:29.873 position:50% align:center
The princess who went missing
all those years ago

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:32.208 position:50% align:center
was actually me.

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:34.794 position:50% align:center
I survived not on my own merit,

00:21:34.878 --> 00:21:36.921 position:50% align:center
but because I had kind people
like your father

00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:38.465 position:50% align:center
looking out for me.

00:21:38.548 --> 00:21:41.092 position:50% align:center
And yet, I haven't
done anything.

00:21:41.176 --> 00:21:43.136 position:50% align:center
Not for the kingdom, at least.

00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:44.637 position:50% align:center
The only thing I've
done successfully

00:21:44.721 --> 00:21:47.891 position:50% align:center
is drag you and
Albert into this war.

00:21:47.974 --> 00:21:51.394 position:50% align:center
Words can't convey how
deeply sorry I am for that.

00:21:52.437 --> 00:21:54.272 position:50% align:center
I was born into royalty,

00:21:54.356 --> 00:21:57.609 position:50% align:center
but the title of "princess"
doesn't suit me.

00:21:59.069 --> 00:22:00.862 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
My father had a saying.

00:22:02.072 --> 00:22:04.324 position:50% align:center
Be as a torch to
guide your people.

00:22:04.407 --> 00:22:05.492 position:50% align:center
Light the darkness.

00:22:05.575 --> 00:22:07.827 position:50% align:center
Warm them to their core.

00:22:07.911 --> 00:22:09.913 position:50% align:center
To be like a flame
and burn fiercely,

00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:13.667 position:50% align:center
come what may, is the duty
of those destined to rule.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:14.959 position:50% align:center
And to preserve
that flame so that it

00:22:15.043 --> 00:22:18.755 position:50% align:center
never once goes out,
is the duty of a knight.

00:22:21.883 --> 00:22:25.220 position:50% align:center
From what I've seen,
you embody that fire.

00:22:25.303 --> 00:22:28.014 position:50% align:center
Your soul burns bright
for the kingdom.

00:22:28.098 --> 00:22:30.558 position:50% align:center
You also made me
realize something.

00:22:30.642 --> 00:22:33.019 position:50% align:center
What I should actually
be protecting.

00:22:38.858 --> 00:22:41.653 position:50% align:center
You can guide more people
the way you did me.

00:22:41.736 --> 00:22:44.739 position:50% align:center
You'll make them the happiest
they've ever been.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.743 position:50% align:center
There's no telling what
obstacles lie ahead.

00:22:48.827 --> 00:22:54.749 position:50% align:center
Even so, I vow to
keep you safe. Always.

00:22:54.833 --> 00:22:57.419 position:50% align:center
Because I want you to be
the flame that shines the way

00:22:57.502 --> 00:23:00.797 position:50% align:center
for the people and
leads us into the future.

00:23:11.558 --> 00:23:14.644 position:50% align:center
Princess Marielle,

00:23:14.728 --> 00:23:19.941 position:50% align:center
I, Alfred of Albert, swear on
the very blade I owe my life

00:23:20.025 --> 00:23:22.736 position:50% align:center
that you have my
absolute allegiance.

00:23:33.038 --> 00:23:35.373 position:50% align:center
[LACROIX] Soon. The time
is close at hand now.

00:23:35.457 --> 00:23:36.750 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE] I don't believe
I'll ever get used to

00:23:36.833 --> 00:23:38.335 position:50% align:center
you calling me a princess.

00:23:38.418 --> 00:23:39.711 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] So that's the story
behind those unfounded hunts.

00:23:39.794 --> 00:23:41.504 position:50% align:center
[LACROIX] Pure Magonian
power resides within.

00:23:41.588 --> 00:23:43.840 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE] My birthday wish
is that life will go on

00:23:43.923 --> 00:23:46.676 position:50% align:center
just like this,
forever and ever!
