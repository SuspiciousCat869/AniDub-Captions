[NONNORIA gasps]
But how can this be?

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.646 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Is something
the matter, Nonnoria?

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.565 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, there is.

00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:25.984 position:50% align:center
This isn't even close to the
number of medicinal herbs

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:27.944 position:50% align:center
I originally ordered.

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:30.697 position:50% align:center
Sorry, it's all I could
manage to scrounge up.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.449 position:50% align:center
And why is that, sir?

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:35.535 position:50% align:center
Well, 'cause, rumor is
Cocon Village is a ghost town.

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:38.288 position:50% align:center
Huh? Cocon Village?

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:39.706 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Are you familiar?

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.001 position:50% align:center
Once upon a time, they traded
goods with my hometown.

00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:44.210 position:50% align:center
That place must supply over half

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:47.088 position:50% align:center
the medicinal herbs
in the whole kingdom.

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:49.799 position:50% align:center
It wouldn't suddenly
just become abandoned.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:52.510 position:50% align:center
Either way, they're a
rarity these days.

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:54.804 position:50% align:center
Reason why they're
priced so high.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:58.099 position:50% align:center
Sir. My people need those
herbs for their wellbeing.

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:00.393 position:50% align:center
I can arrange the
funds to buy them.

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.354 position:50% align:center
So, I'll ask this
request of you.

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:04.814 position:50% align:center
Can you gather more
for the sake of Albert?

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:07.275 position:50% align:center
Aw, jeez. You don't
hold back, huh?

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:08.568 position:50% align:center
Well, all right.

00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:10.070 position:50% align:center
Since the lords of Albert
have been good to me

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:13.948 position:50% align:center
for two generations now,
I'll see what I can do.

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:15.367 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.868 position:50% align:center
That's such a relief!

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:18.244 position:50% align:center
Moru!

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:19.829 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER 7A]
We appreciate it, my lord.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:23.458 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER 7B] Such a noble deed!
That's Fernando's son for you!

00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:28.213 position:50% align:center
Cocon Village. I smell
a big, stinkin' rat.

00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:05.769 position:50% align:center
So, in the end, this is all
we were able to buy, moru?

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:08.063 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA] Sadly, yes.
Oh, we're going to go through

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:10.982 position:50% align:center
such a limited supply
in no time.

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:12.650 position:50% align:center
We'll really be in
trouble if Alfred

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:15.236 position:50% align:center
or the others
get seriously hurt.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.072 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Hey, don't mind me.

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:18.073 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA]
Deflotte!

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:19.699 position:50% align:center
[QOO]
Whacha doin', moru?

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:21.493 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna visit Cocon Village.

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:24.537 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA] What? But I thought
it's uninhabited now.

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:26.414 position:50% align:center
That's what the rumors say.

00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:27.749 position:50% align:center
Figured I'd see for myself

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:29.709 position:50% align:center
and get some herbs
while I'm there.

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:30.794 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
I'll go with you.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.754 position:50% align:center
Huh? Hold on.

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:36.216 position:50% align:center
Lords help move things along,
especially in terms of business.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.175 position:50% align:center
--Then, I'm coming, too!
--Thank you,

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:38.718 position:50% align:center
but I'll be fine on my own.

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:40.428 position:50% align:center
It's for my people.

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:43.598 position:50% align:center
Besides, I have a genuine
concern for Cocon.

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:45.850 position:50% align:center
A village getting abandoned
overnight sounds bizarre

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:47.936 position:50% align:center
no matter how you look at it.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.646 position:50% align:center
Good grief.

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.606 position:50% align:center
If it's quite all right
with you, my lord,

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.191 position:50% align:center
I wish to join you.

00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:54.776 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Why so eager?

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.780 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Nonnoria,
but it's quite a long trek.

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:01.116 position:50% align:center
And I'd rather not
put you in harm's way.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.577 position:50% align:center
I know. You're right.
But, still.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.833 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Look after things for
me while we're gone, Maurice.

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:12.335 position:50% align:center
Right. I'll hold down the fort.

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:18.174 position:50% align:center
Please, take care, my lord.
And come back to Albert safely.

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.183 position:50% align:center
Listen, Maurice.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:28.268 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
Hm?

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:31.855 position:50% align:center
May I ask a favor of you?

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:38.611 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] The reason Cocon
grows various herbs

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:41.197 position:50% align:center
is because of their
rich water supply.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.741 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] This, in turn,
led to the development

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:44.451 position:50% align:center
of the town's medical skills.

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:47.829 position:50% align:center
People from all over Hortensia
depend on them for cures.

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:49.497 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Which means
this won't just be a problem

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:51.958 position:50% align:center
for Albert if the
rumors are true.

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:56.546 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.256 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] Speaking of problems,
looks like we have

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.342 position:50% align:center
another one straight ahead.

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:01.760 position:50% align:center
[MERCHANT 7B]
What's going on here?

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:03.345 position:50% align:center
None of your concern!

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:05.305 position:50% align:center
They're from the church.

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:06.514 position:50% align:center
Due to flooding,

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:08.683 position:50% align:center
Cocon Village has been
completely deserted.

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:09.893 position:50% align:center
We've blocked this path because

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.145 position:50% align:center
it's much too dangerous
for travelers.

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:14.773 position:50% align:center
But where can I go to get
herbs if not from Cocon?

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.649 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 7A] You'll have to
manage without them.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:18.360 position:50% align:center
Oh no.

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:24.866 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] That knight said
it's because of flooding.

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.576 position:50% align:center
[QOO]
Which is major, moru.

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:30.705 position:50% align:center
I don't believe it
for a second. This way.

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.332 position:50% align:center
You know of another route?

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:35.001 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] I did tell you
we used to trade with them.

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:36.670 position:50% align:center
So, I learned about
plenty of shortcuts

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:38.672 position:50% align:center
we can take our pick from.

00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:46.763 position:50% align:center
Hey, we're not lost, are we?

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.765 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] There's nothing
for you to worry about.

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:51.101 position:50% align:center
--I'm sure.
--Moru.

00:05:55.146 --> 00:06:00.527 position:50% align:center
Lo and behold, Cocon Village.
Ye of such little faith.

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:09.619 position:50% align:center
[QOO] There's no
flooding anywhere, moru.

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:11.913 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Yep, called that one.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:16.418 position:50% align:center
Excuse me.
Do you have a minute?

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:19.170 position:50% align:center
[COCON VILLAGER 7A]
Uh... Who are you people?

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:21.840 position:50% align:center
You didn't come from
outside the village, did you?

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:22.966 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.759 position:50% align:center
We heard a rumor
this town was abandoned,

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:26.261 position:50% align:center
so we came to investigate.

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:28.680 position:50% align:center
[COCON VILLAGER 7A]
Ah. That's the story.

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:32.017 position:50% align:center
Mister, is the Orthodox Church
somehow involved, by any chance?

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.478 position:50% align:center
Yes. It is.

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:39.941 position:50% align:center
[COCON VILLAGER 7A] About two
years ago, some Ecclesiastical

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:43.194 position:50% align:center
Knights marched into town
with no advanced warning.

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:44.988 position:50% align:center
Said they were
placing the hospital,

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:48.533 position:50% align:center
as well as the whole village,
under the church's control.

00:06:48.616 --> 00:06:50.493 position:50% align:center
They then took it
upon themselves to

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.746 position:50% align:center
set up a checkpoint
at the entrance before

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:55.582 position:50% align:center
eventually locking
everything down entirely.

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:57.751 position:50% align:center
Every last one of
them is a jerk.

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:00.962 position:50% align:center
I mean, why go through the
trouble of doing that, anyway?

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:02.088 position:50% align:center
[COCON VILLAGER 7A]
Well, you see.

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:03.381 position:50% align:center
[ADEL]
Hold on.

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:06.426 position:50% align:center
It would be best
if you refrained from

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:08.511 position:50% align:center
speaking out of turn.

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:11.473 position:50% align:center
[ADEL] For what reason
are you here asking about

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.433 position:50% align:center
the Orthodox Church's business?

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:16.019 position:50% align:center
Heh. Guess they sent
one of their mangy mutts

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.687 position:50% align:center
to keep people in line.

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:21.816 position:50% align:center
Oh. So, you dare to challenge
the will of the church?

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.401 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:25.278 position:50% align:center
Stand down.

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:27.405 position:50% align:center
[ADEL]
You need not draw your blade.

00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:28.865 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:32.702 position:50% align:center
I'm a former priest.
You may call me Adel.

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.537 position:50% align:center
"Former," you say?

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:37.165 position:50% align:center
Yes, for I lost any right
to serve God and have

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:40.293 position:50% align:center
broken away from the Orthodox
Church and its followers.

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:41.836 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] If the only reason
you're saying that

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.506 position:50% align:center
is so you can try
and trick us, I swear--!

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:47.217 position:50% align:center
When I was of
the cloth, years ago,

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.802 position:50% align:center
I was assigned to Petale Village

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.887 position:50% align:center
to contain their
widespread plague.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.555 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:55.767 position:50% align:center
So many tragedies that
sickness left in its wake.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.062 position:50% align:center
I forsook them
and fled in fright.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:03.608 position:50% align:center
Ever since that day I've been
walking an apostate's path.

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:08.113 position:50% align:center
I reside here in Cocon
to atone for my sins.

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:09.948 position:50% align:center
Which is why I have
no qualms telling you

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:13.159 position:50% align:center
exactly what the church
is doing in this village.

00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:14.411 position:50% align:center
Come with me.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:30.385 position:50% align:center
Hey. Ever meet the priest
from Petale? Just curious.

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:32.762 position:50% align:center
Do you mean Father Danois?

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:37.892 position:50% align:center
[ADEL] That man was
a pillar of pure strength

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:40.478 position:50% align:center
to those who lived
in terror of the plague.

00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:42.272 position:50% align:center
His faith was strong as well.

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:45.400 position:50% align:center
He was the epitome of
what a priest should be.

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:46.985 position:50% align:center
That so?

00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:52.532 position:50% align:center
[ADEL]
I believe our meeting like this

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:54.743 position:50% align:center
may not be mere happenstance.

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:56.327 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED gasps]

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:57.954 position:50% align:center
Look over there.

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:02.125 position:50% align:center
[ADEL] Gnoll Hospital.
Now, of course,

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:05.128 position:50% align:center
placed under the Orthodox
Church's control.

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:07.547 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] It appears their
security is fairly tight.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.300 position:50% align:center
Are they even serving
a purpose by standing guard?

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:11.718 position:50% align:center
I imagine they are.

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:13.970 position:50% align:center
They keep petridermic
plague victims in there.

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:14.929 position:50% align:center
What?

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:16.348 position:50% align:center
Absurd!

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:18.725 position:50% align:center
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but didn't the plague die out?

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:22.479 position:50% align:center
It might have if Petale had been
the only place affected by it.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:25.648 position:50% align:center
At some point, gossip about
the sickness managed to quiet.

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:27.650 position:50% align:center
And all the afflicted
went missing.

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:30.779 position:50% align:center
I've yet to hear of a single
case where someone recovered.

00:09:30.862 --> 00:09:32.155 position:50% align:center
Are you being serious?

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:34.407 position:50% align:center
That hospital is
treating plague victims?

00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:36.242 position:50% align:center
[ADEL]
Yes, I believe so.

00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:37.744 position:50% align:center
The church is
attempting to cover up

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:39.996 position:50% align:center
the disease as well
as contain it.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.290 position:50% align:center
And what's worse,
I also fear the doctors

00:09:42.374 --> 00:09:45.335 position:50% align:center
are conducting experiments
on those poor people.

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:47.087 position:50% align:center
Those fiends!

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.880 position:50% align:center
I wish to free the patients.

00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:52.842 position:50% align:center
But I simply cannot accomplish
such a feat all on my own.

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:56.221 position:50% align:center
Therefore, I would
appreciate your help.

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:57.180 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
You have it.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:58.807 position:50% align:center
How can we help you?

00:09:58.890 --> 00:09:59.849 position:50% align:center
I'll take you to a channel

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50% align:center
leading to the
hospital's basement.

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:03.061 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] All right.
Let's not waste any time.

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:04.229 position:50% align:center
Just a moment.

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:05.313 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:07.148 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
What's the hold up, Alfred?

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:13.154 position:50% align:center
Before we act, we should
notify Captain Georg first.

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:15.281 position:50% align:center
No! We don't have time for that!

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:17.033 position:50% align:center
People could be losing
their lives right now,

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:20.161 position:50% align:center
yet you would rather
go give a report?

00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:21.663 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] We can't
overlook what's happening

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:24.207 position:50% align:center
in this village, nor can we
ignore those still suffering

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.835 position:50% align:center
from the petridermic
plague. But--

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:28.128 position:50% align:center
What is there to consider?

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:30.964 position:50% align:center
You know how much power
the Orthodox Church has.

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:33.258 position:50% align:center
It's undeniable.

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:35.093 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
Careful, Lord Albert.

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:36.845 position:50% align:center
This isn't your
typical fight and

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:39.931 position:50% align:center
drawing your sword
will have repercussions.

00:10:40.015 --> 00:10:42.183 position:50% align:center
You do realize that, yes?

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:44.728 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Wait.

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:46.980 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you're actually
afraid of the Church.

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:49.733 position:50% align:center
I expected better
from you, Alfred.

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:51.192 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Let's go, Adel.

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:52.444 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:53.486 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Yeah.

00:10:57.157 --> 00:10:58.450 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Come on!

00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
This is one atrocity they're
not gonna get away with!

00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:30.148 position:50% align:center
It's really dark
and damp in here.

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:33.109 position:50% align:center
Feels like something
might jump out, moru.

00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:37.322 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Save me! Please, Moru!

00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:39.407 position:50% align:center
Ouch.

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:41.618 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, moru.

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:46.581 position:50% align:center
You're not hurt,
are you, Marius?

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:48.875 position:50% align:center
I'm fine. Thanks.

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.461 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Jeez. You sure are a handful.

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:54.422 position:50% align:center
Clear the air by
spelling it out for the kid.

00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:56.966 position:50% align:center
I mean, you've got a lot more
riding on this decision

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.302 position:50% align:center
than the church's
respect, don't you?

00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:06.643 position:50% align:center
You're right. I do fear them.

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.937 position:50% align:center
I'm scared of
the Orthodox Church.

00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:14.317 position:50% align:center
If a territorial lord
were arrested for rebelling,

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:15.568 position:50% align:center
do you know what would happen?

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:17.028 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Huh?

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:20.115 position:50% align:center
I'd be stripped of
every piece of property I own.

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:22.283 position:50% align:center
And my people would be
placed under their control.

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:24.327 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:26.329 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] The Ecclesiastical
Order would then be likely

00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:29.791 position:50% align:center
to oppress the citizens
of Albert without mercy.

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:33.169 position:50% align:center
That's why it's no easy matter
for me to go against them.

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:35.338 position:50% align:center
But I've seen the awful
things they do as well as

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:37.549 position:50% align:center
the miserable state
the kingdom's in,

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:40.051 position:50% align:center
and I can't say I'm not
having second thoughts.

00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:46.266 position:50% align:center
Is there something I can do?
Because there's no justice.

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:54.149 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Sorry, let's keep moving.

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:00.488 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] Alfred has been
acting as a lord.

00:13:00.572 --> 00:13:04.242 position:50% align:center
Restraining himself in order
to protect his people.

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:07.579 position:50% align:center
Which begs the question,
what am I doing?

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:13.835 position:50% align:center
[ADEL]
Up ahead is where the hospital

00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:16.546 position:50% align:center
draws water from the channel.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:19.799 position:50% align:center
There shouldn't be
anybody around at this hour.

00:13:19.883 --> 00:13:21.426 position:50% align:center
This is the perfect
time and place for

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:23.428 position:50% align:center
a ghost to make
its appearance, moru.

00:13:23.511 --> 00:13:24.971 position:50% align:center
Why keep bringing that stuff up?

00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:27.932 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be something super
scary, like an undead, moru!

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:30.143 position:50% align:center
Come on, you moru
-monster. Relax.

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:31.811 position:50% align:center
There are
no undead down here.

00:13:31.895 --> 00:13:32.812 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:33.688 position:50% align:center
[QOO]
I hate being right, moru!

00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:35.565 position:50% align:center
Why are there undead down here?!

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.692 position:50% align:center
So, these things
aren't just in Petale?

00:13:37.776 --> 00:13:38.735 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:48.828 position:50% align:center
You sure don't make it easy!

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:50.330 position:50% align:center
I have no idea
where you come from,

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:52.248 position:50% align:center
but it ain't my hometown!

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:56.044 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?
You're frozen stiff!

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:06.888 position:50% align:center
Is everyone all right?

00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:10.809 position:50% align:center
Yeah. But why were
there undead here?

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:12.268 position:50% align:center
[ADEL] It's the first
time I've ever seen

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:14.604 position:50% align:center
those creatures in this place.

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:17.524 position:50% align:center
Are you well?
You seem somewhat paler.

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:19.192 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
I don't know what you mean,

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:21.361 position:50% align:center
but I do know we
should keep moving.

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:37.293 position:50% align:center
[ADEL] The patients are
likely being held in there.

00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:39.129 position:50% align:center
Ready?

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:40.588 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:59.190 position:50% align:center
[PATIENTS groaning]

00:14:59.274 --> 00:15:00.025 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Voices?

00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:02.068 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE gasps]
Over here!

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:06.114 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:19.669 position:50% align:center
It's just as I thought.

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:21.504 position:50% align:center
They're all victims
of the plague.

00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:25.550 position:50% align:center
What sane person would confine
the sick down in a basement?

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:27.135 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] It's like
they're waiting for death

00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:28.636 position:50% align:center
to release them.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.982 position:50% align:center
Is anyone here
from Petale Village?

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:47.530 position:50% align:center
Someone's coming!

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:49.657 position:50% align:center
This is more than enough proof,
so let's withdraw.

00:15:49.741 --> 00:15:50.950 position:50% align:center
Good idea.

00:15:58.416 --> 00:15:59.459 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Hurry!

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:02.629 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:05.173 position:50% align:center
Deflotte!

00:16:08.385 --> 00:16:11.012 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:12.722 position:50% align:center
Who the heck is this guy?

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:15.183 position:50% align:center
Damn, that hurt.

00:16:15.266 --> 00:16:17.435 position:50% align:center
That's a whole lotta man.

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:20.814 position:50% align:center
[GRAFF chuckles]
So, you're the intruder

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:22.399 position:50% align:center
that's been tiptoeing about.

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
Good gracious.
You filthy rats sneak in

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:27.904 position:50% align:center
from the smallest nooks
and crannies imaginable.

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:31.616 position:50% align:center
That's Doctor Graff.
He practices at this hospital.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.535 position:50% align:center
I was growing weary
dealing with people

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:36.371 position:50% align:center
on the brink of death,
so perfect timing.

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:38.957 position:50% align:center
Have fun with your
new playmate, Gaston.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.962 position:50% align:center
Oh, but be sure to leave
a little life in him. [cackles]

00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:56.349 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Those might as well be scratches

00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:58.768 position:50% align:center
from how he's reacting!

00:16:58.852 --> 00:17:02.147 position:50% align:center
[ADEL] He must be an experiment
in physical modification.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.107 position:50% align:center
Hey, you! What the
hell are you doing

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.067 position:50% align:center
to these all these
people down here?

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:08.903 position:50% align:center
Treating them. What else?

00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:11.448 position:50% align:center
I drug them up until
they can't understand

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:14.409 position:50% align:center
the meaning of the word
"pain "anymore.

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:16.161 position:50% align:center
And when a body feels no pain,

00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:19.581 position:50% align:center
I can perform whatever
experiments I want to on it.

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:22.292 position:50% align:center
They're the exact opposite of
people on the verge of death

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:25.503 position:50% align:center
who scream about the most
insignificant things.

00:17:25.587 --> 00:17:27.756 position:50% align:center
[cackles]

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.467 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] You're the worst
kind of scum in existence.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.260 position:50% align:center
Oh, so I'm scum?

00:17:32.344 --> 00:17:34.304 position:50% align:center
I don't think someone
carrying out direct orders

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:36.723 position:50% align:center
from the pope
qualifies for that word.

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:38.183 position:50% align:center
The pope?

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:40.560 position:50% align:center
Idiot!

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.776 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
You all need to get outta here!

00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:49.277 position:50% align:center
What is it you're planning?

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:51.529 position:50% align:center
Can't plan when
fate's in control.

00:17:51.613 --> 00:17:52.906 position:50% align:center
I was led here for a reason.

00:17:52.989 --> 00:17:54.532 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Please, don't do this!

00:17:54.616 --> 00:17:55.825 position:50% align:center
It's a job for
the guy who doesn't

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:58.286 position:50% align:center
shoulder other responsibilities.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:59.621 position:50% align:center
Think about it.

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:02.040 position:50% align:center
What if you get recognized
by one of them?

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:06.711 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] You can't afford
to be caught trespassing.

00:18:06.795 --> 00:18:08.922 position:50% align:center
You have to protect Albert.

00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:10.674 position:50% align:center
You're part of Albert.

00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:13.718 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:14.886 position:50% align:center
Alfred!

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:23.978 position:50% align:center
Marius!

00:18:24.062 --> 00:18:25.897 position:50% align:center
I told you to get outta here!

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.900 position:50% align:center
Alfred wouldn't abandon you
in a million years!

00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:32.320 position:50% align:center
But he also has to protect
his dominion which means--

00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:34.322 position:50% align:center
As his squire,
it's my duty to carry out

00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:36.741 position:50% align:center
my lord's wishes
when he's not able to!

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:38.576 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:42.914 position:50% align:center
More and more rats are
coming to play! [chuckles]

00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:45.834 position:50% align:center
This should expedite
my experiments!

00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:53.550 position:50% align:center
No, Marius! Moru?

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:55.301 position:50% align:center
You can't join the fight.

00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:57.303 position:50% align:center
Because you have to
get outta here.

00:18:57.387 --> 00:18:59.931 position:50% align:center
Go report our
findings with Adel.

00:19:00.015 --> 00:19:02.934 position:50% align:center
Please, Qoo. Do it in my stead.

00:19:09.524 --> 00:19:12.402 position:50% align:center
I've learned
something for myself.

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:14.571 position:50% align:center
From seeing the
plight of this village

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:18.199 position:50% align:center
and the other vile crimes
the church has done.

00:19:18.283 --> 00:19:21.619 position:50% align:center
I've learned simply protecting
my people isn't enough.

00:19:21.703 --> 00:19:25.665 position:50% align:center
I have to protect both
my people and my friends!

00:19:25.749 --> 00:19:28.126 position:50% align:center
As the reigning lord
of Albert's Dominion,

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:32.797 position:50% align:center
and as the son of Sir Fernando,
that's my just cause!

00:19:34.758 --> 00:19:36.176 position:50% align:center
I really hope you know
what you're doing.

00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:39.179 position:50% align:center
You certainly are one
hell of a lord, Alfred.

00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:40.722 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter if
there's an entire

00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:42.682 position:50% align:center
nest of rats hiding
in the walls.

00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:45.685 position:50% align:center
Gaston will crush you all!

00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:09.668 position:50% align:center
You beat my specimen
as if he were nothing.

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:11.002 position:50% align:center
You'll bring all the atrocities

00:20:11.086 --> 00:20:12.921 position:50% align:center
the church committed
here to light.

00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:16.549 position:50% align:center
And you'll do so truthfully.
In the name of Albert.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.303 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Sir Didier!

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:21.888 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
When did he get here?

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:23.390 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
What in the world are you doing

00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:26.184 position:50% align:center
in a place like this,
Lord Albert?

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:28.103 position:50% align:center
You're rather far from home.

00:20:28.186 --> 00:20:30.855 position:50% align:center
I was just about to
ask you the same thing!

00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:33.233 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] I'm here to provide
aid for those suffering

00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:35.902 position:50% align:center
from disease as
a result of their sins.

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:37.070 position:50% align:center
Thank you for asking.

00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:38.405 position:50% align:center
The last thing you're
doing is "aiding"!

00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:41.199 position:50% align:center
Hah! Who'd believe
such a blatant lie?

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:42.492 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
The one who concocted this

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:44.994 position:50% align:center
whole idea is
Pope Vall d'Hebron.

00:20:45.078 --> 00:20:48.081 position:50% align:center
Then until I'm able to
speak with the pope directly,

00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:51.084 position:50% align:center
Didier, you're my prisoner!

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:53.294 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] If you had just
minded your own business

00:20:53.378 --> 00:20:54.713 position:50% align:center
on the land you were given,

00:20:54.796 --> 00:20:57.799 position:50% align:center
you could have lived out
your life in peace and safety.

00:20:57.882 --> 00:20:59.509 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
Wretched fool!

00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:05.390 position:50% align:center
No!

00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:06.433 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] I can't fathom
why someone would

00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:08.268 position:50% align:center
cast away his security

00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:11.479 position:50% align:center
and stray from the path to the
idyllic future he was promised.

00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:13.273 position:50% align:center
It's beyond baffling.

00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:15.191 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
Hm?

00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:17.736 position:50% align:center
Are you two okay?

00:21:21.865 --> 00:21:25.910 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] And just like that,
the mystery is solved.

00:21:25.994 --> 00:21:28.413 position:50% align:center
You tried to survive
by posing as a boy

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:32.250 position:50% align:center
to deceive everyone,
and it actually worked.

00:21:32.334 --> 00:21:34.836 position:50% align:center
Stop it. Let him go!

00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:37.464 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
But I've finally caught you.

00:21:37.547 --> 00:21:41.301 position:50% align:center
This girl is the
petridermic plague witch.

00:21:41.384 --> 00:21:43.428 position:50% align:center
There's no way!

00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:44.888 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
Seize those two.

00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:47.974 position:50% align:center
They are criminals who are
in league with the witch.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.771 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Wait! Didier!

00:21:55.273 --> 00:21:56.608 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Marius!

00:23:33.413 --> 00:23:35.373 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
I swore to protect my friends

00:23:35.457 --> 00:23:37.000 position:50% align:center
and everything
that's dear to me.

00:23:37.083 --> 00:23:38.668 position:50% align:center
[LUCAN] "Your friend"
is sentenced to death.

00:23:38.752 --> 00:23:40.420 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
If I'm gone, then nobody else

00:23:40.503 --> 00:23:42.130 position:50% align:center
will be endangered for my sake.

00:23:42.213 --> 00:23:43.673 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
It can't end like this!

00:23:43.757 --> 00:23:46.426 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Farewell, Alfred.
