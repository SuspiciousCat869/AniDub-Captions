00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.775 position:50% align:center
The princess's army, you say?

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.485 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] She has banded
together with rebels

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.154 position:50% align:center
from every corner
of the kingdom,

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:31.698 position:50% align:center
and they're presently
advancing on the capital.

00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:34.492 position:50% align:center
My memory may be a bit hazy,

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.036 position:50% align:center
but weren't you
supposed to execute her

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:37.662 position:50% align:center
so this wouldn't happen?

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:39.873 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] Seems I'd
miscalculated her strength,

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:41.541 position:50% align:center
as well as her allies.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:45.337 position:50% align:center
A mistake I will not be
making again, rest assured.

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:49.090 position:50% align:center
I'd certainly like to
hope so, Sir Didier.

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:52.302 position:50% align:center
She's no longer the
weak child she once was.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:56.097 position:50% align:center
Now, if I may be excused.
I need to offer up a prayer.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.809 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL]
Pope Vall D'Hebron.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.397 position:50% align:center
Royal Order Squad Two
is standing by.

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:07.192 position:50% align:center
We can make haste to the
battlefield right away.

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:09.152 position:50% align:center
I swear to you, here and now,

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:12.489 position:50% align:center
the princess and those foolish
rebels shall meet their demise.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:15.909 position:50% align:center
I do admire your spirit.
It's refreshing.

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:17.827 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL] And when
everything's said and done,

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:21.247 position:50% align:center
I trust you'll consider
that matter I mentioned before.

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:23.249 position:50% align:center
That's all I'm asking.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.086 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] I think your request
is a little premature.

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:27.337 position:50% align:center
We still haven't received word

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.215 position:50% align:center
on Balthauser's
whereabouts or status.

00:01:30.298 --> 00:01:31.800 position:50% align:center
But if he is, in fact, dead,

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:35.345 position:50% align:center
I would be the most fitting
replacement for my grandfather.

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.515 position:50% align:center
Were you aware among
the rebel army's ranks

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:39.974 position:50% align:center
is the young lord of Albert?

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:44.312 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL gasps]
I am now.

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:47.649 position:50% align:center
You may use my
Paladin Corps as you wish.

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:49.859 position:50% align:center
I'll give you full command.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:52.654 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL] I'm most appreciative,
Your Holiness.

00:01:52.737 --> 00:01:54.614 position:50% align:center
Then I'd best go ready them.

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:57.867 position:50% align:center
What are the chances
Fernando's son

00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:00.245 position:50% align:center
would actually be
the enemy I'm facing?

00:02:00.328 --> 00:02:03.081 position:50% align:center
Guess the time has come
to settle the score.

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:43.223 position:50% align:center
All right, guys. You tell me.
Who should I kill first?

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:45.767 position:50% align:center
I think I recognize
some of these soldiers.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.520 position:50% align:center
They're the jerks who
keep getting in our way!

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:49.938 position:50% align:center
[ELVA]
Oh, you're right.

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.816 position:50% align:center
They're definitely
overdue for a punishment!

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.902 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
It's those two again?

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:57.904 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] It's a lot more
than two, Deflotte.

No, that's the princess faction!

Ready, men?

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:06.788 position:50% align:center
[HORTENSIAN SOLDIER 10F]
Prepare for a counterattack!

00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:09.708 position:50% align:center
Stay your blades!
I want you to re-form ranks!

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.209 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mister.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.379 position:50% align:center
Today's the day you die!

You don't have to do this!

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.467 position:50% align:center
Get back here, Elva!

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:24.180 position:50% align:center
And what was that for?

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:27.392 position:50% align:center
The number of people getting
in our way keeps on growing.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.399 position:50% align:center

You've overstepped your bounds.

[ROY] Who would've thought the
naÃ¯ve boy I once crossed blades

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:41.448 position:50% align:center
with years ago would
grow up to be a leader

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.908 position:50% align:center
of the princess's forces?

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:46.327 position:50% align:center
You've changed so much.

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:50.790 position:50% align:center
[ELVA] Boring! If you're
gonna spoil our fun,

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:52.292 position:50% align:center
at least be entertaining!

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.794 position:50% align:center
[THALIA] Or we could just
kill you and be done with it.

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:56.212 position:50% align:center
Don't push your luck.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50% align:center

over your "entertainment."

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:00.091 position:50% align:center
What plans?

'Cause we don't!

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.430 position:50% align:center

then you should play fair!

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.192 position:50% align:center
[ROY] Camellia didn't
intend for any of this.

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:21.821 position:50% align:center
It was all one big accident.
I apologize for the confusion.

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:23.865 position:50% align:center
So, we'll be taking
our leave of you now.

take your pride lightly.

the smartest choice?

but seems difficult to wield.

And the church has more.

step out of line again.

too lenient with them?

should befit their offense.

from our allied nation.

exists as it is today

In any case.

I'm curious to know

[ROY] Alfred,
Lord of Albert's Dominion.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.933 position:50% align:center
Heh. He chose to honor
a truce for his men

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:58.269 position:50% align:center
rather than settle
his personal affairs.

00:07:58.353 --> 00:08:00.563 position:50% align:center
I highly respect that.

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:04.943 position:50% align:center
The Camellian army
continues to maintain distance.

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:07.028 position:50% align:center
Are we sure this isn't
some kind of ploy

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:09.739 position:50% align:center
to lure us into
a false sense of security?

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:11.366 position:50% align:center
Roy gave his word.

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:14.244 position:50% align:center
He said they intend us
no harm, and he meant it.

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:15.578 position:50% align:center
You would be amazed by how much

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:17.747 position:50% align:center
Camellian knights
value their pride.

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.582 position:50% align:center
And he chose to swear on his.

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:22.335 position:50% align:center
So that's an oath I do not
forsee him breaking.

00:08:22.419 --> 00:08:24.963 position:50% align:center
That said, regarding
the rest of Hortensia,

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:27.549 position:50% align:center
he made no such claims.
Just us.

00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:30.593 position:50% align:center
Because we support the princess,
not the Orthodox Church.

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:32.887 position:50% align:center
We share a common enemy,
so now we're friends?

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:35.306 position:50% align:center
Yes. At least
that's my thinking.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.060 position:50% align:center
Makes sense. So, their
objective's the same as ours.

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:40.270 position:50% align:center
We shouldn't provoke them

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:42.230 position:50% align:center
if they're going to
avoid combat with us.

00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:43.940 position:50% align:center
Let's leave them alone for now.

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:45.859 position:50% align:center
Right. Freeing the
oppressed people

first and foremost.

[ADELHEID]
Muskets.

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:53.992 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
You know what they are?

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:57.454 position:50% align:center
I do. Our secret agent's
reports have mentioned them.

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:58.705 position:50% align:center
They're weapons
designed to shoot out

explosive force.

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:02.500 position:50% align:center

I honestly didn't expect to see

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:04.502 position:50% align:center
muskets in battle so soon.

00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:07.005 position:50% align:center
They don't look it, but these
devices can penetrate

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:10.258 position:50% align:center
iron armor even if you're firing
them from across the field.

00:09:10.342 --> 00:09:12.677 position:50% align:center
The best part is they
don't require much training.

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:13.511 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry!

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:15.055 position:50% align:center
You can't be serious.

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:17.474 position:50% align:center
[BERTRAND] Sure, I can!
It's fine, though.

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:18.850 position:50% align:center
Apparently, hitting what
you're aiming for

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:20.602 position:50% align:center
is easier said than done.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:23.646 position:50% align:center
And preparing the shots
is also a bit of a hassle.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.108 position:50% align:center
Depending on the formation,
those could pose a real threat.

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:29.319 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID] What's more,
the main Ecclesiastical Order

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.571 position:50% align:center
is probably equipped with them.

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:34.240 position:50% align:center
[MESSENGER 10A]
Our reconnaissance unit

00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:36.951 position:50% align:center
came into contact with the enemy
and after engaging with them,

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:38.578 position:50% align:center
were wholly annihilated.

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:39.829 position:50% align:center
More than anything,

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.748 position:50% align:center
that mission was a
trial run for the muskets.

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:44.918 position:50% align:center
The casualties were
well within our expectations.

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:46.795 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL]
Is that all?

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:48.838 position:50% align:center
No. Despite the loss,

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:52.425 position:50% align:center
the force of the muskets proved
to be considerably effective.

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:57.514 position:50% align:center
Also, Alfred Albert was spotted
fighting on the forefront, sir.

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.099 position:50% align:center
Oh, was he?

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:00.892 position:50% align:center
So, the princess
deemed that infernal man

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:04.104 position:50% align:center
worthy of commanding
her ragtag team of fools?

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:07.399 position:50% align:center
It's extraordinarily poetic
if you think about it.

00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:09.776 position:50% align:center
He's the son of the
Templar knight, Fernando.

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:10.944 position:50% align:center
While I'm the grandson of the

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:13.488 position:50% align:center
distinguished immortal
hero, Balthauser.

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:15.782 position:50% align:center
It's fate at its finest,
if you ask me.

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:17.575 position:50% align:center
I doubt there's a story
as perfect as this

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:19.744 position:50% align:center
even in Magonian legends.

00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:21.287 position:50% align:center
[PALADIN 10B]
Greetings, Lord Flegel.

00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:22.956 position:50% align:center
You'll be pleased to
know the Paladin musket

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:24.499 position:50% align:center
detail has arrived.

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:30.422 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL] Hmm. Sensational.
The time is ripe.

00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:34.175 position:50% align:center
Let us drop the iron hammer of
justice on these rebel scum!

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:36.219 position:50% align:center
And as for Alfred Albert.

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:40.682 position:50% align:center
May his humiliating defeat pave
the way for my glorious triumph!

00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:57.032 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] They took position
here, just as we thought.

00:10:57.115 --> 00:10:58.867 position:50% align:center
I know those banners!

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.203 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID] It looks like
Squad Two. Balthauser's unit!

00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Is that bad?

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:06.374 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] They're one of the most
elite squads of the Royal Order.

00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:07.917 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
The old man must've gone senile

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:10.170 position:50% align:center
if he's allying with the church!

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:11.755 position:50% align:center
[ROYAL KNIGHT MESSENGER 10A]
I bring a report!

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:14.341 position:50% align:center
We've managed to identify
the enemy's leader.

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center
It's Flegel Dreadnought.

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:17.844 position:50% align:center
[BERTRAND]
What? I don't believe it!

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:21.014 position:50% align:center
The only Flegel I know of
is Balthauser's grandson!

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:23.099 position:50% align:center
That mediocre young boy?

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
Why would they give
Balthauser's troops to him?

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:27.020 position:50% align:center
I don't want to
imagine the worst,

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:28.438 position:50% align:center
but then what else could it be?

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:30.607 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
I'm gonna stop you right there.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.485 position:50% align:center
[BERTRAND] So, we're up against
the Paladin unit, Squad Two,

00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:34.819 position:50% align:center
and, most likely,

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
an unfortunate number of
soldiers wielding muskets.

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:39.032 position:50% align:center
Anyone got a plan?

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:41.659 position:50% align:center
[ECCLESIASTICAL MESSENGER 10A]
They're here.

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:42.994 position:50% align:center
And they've deployed
in front of the bridge

00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:44.454 position:50% align:center
just as expected, sir.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:45.914 position:50% align:center
Well, of course.

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:48.166 position:50% align:center
An army of inferior
amateurs could never

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:50.335 position:50% align:center
withstand a long,
drawn-out fight.

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:51.711 position:50% align:center
If they want any
hope of winning,

00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:53.046 position:50% align:center
they'll have to cross over.

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:55.298 position:50% align:center
Though even that hope
will soon disappear.

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.384 position:50% align:center
Our troops contain
select individuals and

00:11:57.467 --> 00:12:00.679 position:50% align:center
our weaponry is unlike
anything they've ever seen.

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:03.014 position:50% align:center
Victory is practically
within reach.

00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:06.267 position:50% align:center
No matter how many lives it
costs, the day will be mine!

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:10.146 position:50% align:center
Then I'll finally have the
respect and honor I deserve.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.731 position:50% align:center
These are no pushovers, men.

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:15.110 position:50% align:center
It's the primary Paladin force
and the Royal Order's Squad Two.

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:17.028 position:50% align:center
And they won't just
be shooting arrows at us.

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:18.446 position:50% align:center
Any which way
you look, there'll be

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.573 position:50% align:center
soldiers equipped with muskets.

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:21.866 position:50% align:center
First, we'll position
our archers

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.535 position:50% align:center
on both sides of the bridge.

00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:26.037 position:50% align:center
Maurice and Bertrand Squads
will reinforce their defenses

00:12:26.121 --> 00:12:27.288 position:50% align:center
and then make their way across.

00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:29.457 position:50% align:center
You realize those squads
will be sitting ducks

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:31.126 position:50% align:center
for those musket things, right.

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:32.585 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
That's why I hate to ask,

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:34.170 position:50% align:center
but it's key they persevere.

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:36.464 position:50% align:center
We aren't going to
last very long out there.

00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:38.216 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] You won't have to
because a separate squad

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:41.428 position:50% align:center
will come around and strike the
musket detail from their flanks.

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.805 position:50% align:center
So, it's a sneak attack?

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:45.098 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Those muskets will chew us up

00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:46.975 position:50% align:center
if we attempt
a head-on approach.

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:48.810 position:50% align:center
Our best bet is to
take them by surprise

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:50.812 position:50% align:center
and advance
amidst the confusion.

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:53.148 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] Do you really
think that will work?

00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:54.566 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] If those of us
in the detached force

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:56.735 position:50% align:center
can collapse their formation.

00:12:56.818 --> 00:13:00.071 position:50% align:center
And by "those of us,"
did you mean me, too?

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:03.033 position:50% align:center
I'll be counting on you.

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:04.909 position:50% align:center
Gee, I'm honored.

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:07.620 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID chuckles]
What's the matter?

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:09.539 position:50% align:center
I thought you were
ready to offer yourself up

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:11.750 position:50% align:center
to me upon our first meeting.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:14.919 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:17.255 position:50% align:center
Count me in! Don't just
stand there, Alfred!

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:19.049 position:50% align:center
We've got a mission
to carry out!

00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:20.091 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:28.475 position:50% align:center
Push! Let's go!

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:33.146 position:50% align:center
[PALADIN 10B laughs]
They're using wagons?

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:34.981 position:50% align:center
[PALADIN 10C]
Fire!

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:37.025 position:50% align:center
So, what're we supposed
to do if we get hit?

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:38.735 position:50% align:center
[BERTRAND laughs]

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:41.946 position:50% align:center
Consider yourself as
unlucky and curse the day!

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:46.659 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] That's our cue.
Get ready to circle around!

00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:56.461 position:50% align:center
[ROY]
They've started.

00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:59.422 position:50% align:center
[RUGIS]
Yes. It's only just begun,

00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:02.217 position:50% align:center
but the ending won't be pretty.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.928 position:50% align:center
[ROY]
What shall we do, my lord?

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:09.015 position:50% align:center
[cackles]

00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:10.433 position:50% align:center
We'll sweep them away like the

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:13.478 position:50% align:center
insignificant specks
of dust they are!

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:15.063 position:50% align:center
Fernando's son being in command

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:19.275 position:50% align:center
just makes this win
even sweeter. [cackles]

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:22.696 position:50% align:center
I can hardly wait to hear your
cries of agony as you die.

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:24.364 position:50% align:center
It'll be the music
that plays in my head

00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:26.700 position:50% align:center
when they make me
an official commander!

00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:29.536 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL AIDE 10A]
Flegel!

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:31.287 position:50% align:center
Have we won already?

00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:32.997 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL AIDE 10A]
No. On the left flank, uh...

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:34.249 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL gasps]

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:40.255 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL AIDE 10A] They suddenly
rushed in from upstream, sir.

00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:44.050 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL]
Give me that!

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:49.431 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL]
Do me a favor, Alfred Albert.

00:14:50.849 --> 00:14:52.392 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL]
And die!

00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:55.228 position:50% align:center
What? Who has aim like that?

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:56.396 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:05.822 position:50% align:center
Second volley, release!

00:15:10.702 --> 00:15:15.248 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL] Camellia?
And just who invited you?

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:19.127 position:50% align:center
Looks like Alfred has
the mind of a true tactician.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:22.297 position:50% align:center
I, for one, did not count on
this kind of back up.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.507 position:50% align:center
We have to make the
most of this opportunity!

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:25.717 position:50% align:center
Don't waste it!

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:30.430 position:50% align:center
Show me what you men
are made of and charge!

00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:32.640 position:50% align:center
Cover them as
they advance, archers!

00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:35.143 position:50% align:center
Don't have to tell me twice!

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:42.400 position:50% align:center
[BERTRAND yells]

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:46.446 position:50% align:center
What do we do now?
They've breached our defenses,

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:49.407 position:50% align:center
and the Camellians
aren't letting up at all!

00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:50.992 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL] Send Squad Two
to intercept them

00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:52.452 position:50% align:center
before they get any farther!

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:54.371 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL AIDE 10A] I'm sorry,
sir, but the musket detail

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:55.997 position:50% align:center
is essentially done for!

00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:58.750 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL] Send the Ecclesiastical
Knights to the left flank and--

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:01.920 position:50% align:center
Follow behind the advance force!
All units, charge!

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:05.131 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER SOLDIERS yell]

00:16:05.215 --> 00:16:07.258 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL]
This is almost laughable!

00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:09.761 position:50% align:center
Truly. You call
yourselves "elite"?

00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:11.596 position:50% align:center
Then how is this happening?

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.014 position:50% align:center
With all due respect, sir,

00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:15.266 position:50% align:center
we have suffered
catastrophic losses today.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.811 position:50% align:center
Our best option
would be to fall back.

00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:21.272 position:50% align:center
Shut up! I didn't ask
for your opinion!

00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:23.608 position:50% align:center
Do you know how many
sacrifices I've made?

00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:26.653 position:50% align:center
Just for the chance to take
the helm of my own force!

00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:29.114 position:50% align:center
I even went so far as
to dispose of my grandfather!

00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:30.448 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL AIDES gasp]

00:16:32.409 --> 00:16:35.370 position:50% align:center
Things turned sideways
because of Fernando's son!

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:39.082 position:50% align:center
It all would've worked
perfectly if not for him!

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:41.543 position:50% align:center
So, if I take him out
of the picture, too,

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:44.170 position:50% align:center
next time, I will win!

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:46.715 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL gasps]
Wait, where are you going?

00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:49.175 position:50% align:center
Hey! Nobody gave you
permission to leave!

00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:50.719 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL AIDE 10C] Getting rid
of the lord of Albert

00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:53.430 position:50% align:center
would not affect his army
in the drastic way you envision.

00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:55.974 position:50% align:center
That's the last opinion
I wanna hear out of you!

00:16:56.057 --> 00:16:58.018 position:50% align:center
I don't need people to
tell me their perspectives,

00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:00.437 position:50% align:center
I need them to follow my orders!

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:07.110 position:50% align:center
[panting] How'd it come to this?

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:08.695 position:50% align:center
And why?

00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:10.572 position:50% align:center
Where did I go wrong?

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:14.200 position:50% align:center
Well, desperate times.

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:19.706 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID]
Status?

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:21.624 position:50% align:center
It's all but decided now.

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:24.002 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID] I heard Camellian
forces aided our assault.

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:24.919 position:50% align:center
Is that true?

00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:26.296 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they were here.

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:28.548 position:50% align:center
Came outta nowhere and
then left like the wind.

00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:30.216 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.011 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Squad Two appears to
be relocating to the capital.

00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:35.055 position:50% align:center
I think we, too, should regroup
with our remaining forces.

00:17:35.138 --> 00:17:36.931 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Behind you!

00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:38.099 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.106 position:50% align:center
Who are you?

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:47.609 position:50% align:center
Flegel Dreadnought,
the commander of

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:49.486 position:50% align:center
those troops you demolished.

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:51.738 position:50% align:center
And you're a
commander, too, right?

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:55.617 position:50% align:center
Alfred Albert, I challenge you
to settle matters with a duel.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.994 position:50% align:center
Adelheid, please keep
the princess safe.

00:17:58.078 --> 00:17:59.162 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:04.000 position:50% align:center
Listen here. This battle
is already decided.

00:18:04.084 --> 00:18:04.959 position:50% align:center
So, sheathe your sword.

00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:06.336 position:50% align:center
You listen here!

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:08.171 position:50% align:center
The battle's outcome
didn't matter to me.

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:10.256 position:50% align:center
I really couldn't care less!

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.800 position:50% align:center
Proving my worth
by taking you out

00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:14.260 position:50% align:center
is the only thing I care about!

00:18:14.344 --> 00:18:17.263 position:50% align:center
So, brace yourself,
because I'm tired of waiting!

00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:19.891 position:50% align:center
That's enough!
There's no point to any of this!

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:24.270 position:50% align:center
Silence! The point is I was
born Balthauser's grandson!

00:18:24.354 --> 00:18:27.440 position:50% align:center
I've been compared to you
for as long as I can remember!

00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:30.193 position:50% align:center
I grew up in the
darkness of your shadow!

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:36.408 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL] You've had nothing
but love and adoration.

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:40.787 position:50% align:center
I, on the other hand, was called
a disgrace to the family!

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.331 position:50% align:center
You were always superior to me!

00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:46.209 position:50% align:center
My pride took blow after blow!

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:47.627 position:50% align:center
And then!

00:18:47.711 --> 00:18:50.422 position:50% align:center
You found the princess and
became her personal hero!

00:18:50.505 --> 00:18:52.173 position:50% align:center
What are you doing that I'm not?

00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:54.843 position:50% align:center
What's the difference
between us?

00:18:54.926 --> 00:18:57.303 position:50% align:center
I suppose it doesn't
matter if I know

00:18:57.387 --> 00:19:00.640 position:50% align:center
because your reign of
supremacy ends today!

00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:17.907 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:20.577 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:35.925 position:50% align:center
If only I had been born into the
same life of privilege as you.

00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:40.096 position:50% align:center
Life would be much easier if
things were just handed to me.

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:42.307 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.392 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL]
You, who have everything,

00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:46.353 position:50% align:center
couldn't possibly
understand how I,

00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:47.729 position:50% align:center
who have nothing, actually feel.

00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:48.980 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:49.064 --> 00:19:51.941 position:50% align:center
So just go ahead and die!

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:56.363 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:03.286 --> 00:20:06.289 position:50% align:center
Why, though? Tell me.

00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:09.250 position:50% align:center
Why were you
the only special one?

00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:10.543 position:50% align:center
[MARIELLE]
He's not.

00:20:10.627 --> 00:20:11.795 position:50% align:center
You seem to be
under the impression

00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:14.172 position:50% align:center
Alfred has everything
a man could wish for.

00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:15.507 position:50% align:center
But that's far from the truth.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.760 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL gasps]
Princess Marielle.

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:20.220 position:50% align:center
He's suffered.

00:20:20.303 --> 00:20:21.596 position:50% align:center
Alfred lost his whole family

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.556 position:50% align:center
yet climbed his way
out of that despair.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.892 position:50% align:center
Since he's had to
take his father's place.

00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:27.977 position:50% align:center
His people were in
need of a protector,

00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:29.604 position:50% align:center
so he grew strong for them.

00:20:29.688 --> 00:20:32.607 position:50% align:center
He became the lord
he is for their sake.

00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:34.150 position:50% align:center
Is that something you can do?

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:35.902 position:50% align:center
Or are you different?

00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:54.504 position:50% align:center
[PALADIN 10I]
Lord Flegel.

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:58.341 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL] Not yet. I can't
bear for it to end this way.

00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:00.760 position:50% align:center
Go and assemble
the remaining troops.

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:03.722 position:50% align:center
We can attack them from
behind if we're fast enough!

00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:05.974 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't just stand
there like a moron!

00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:07.809 position:50% align:center
Why won't anyone
do as they're told?

00:21:07.892 --> 00:21:09.561 position:50% align:center
It's annoying as he--

00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:13.648 position:50% align:center
[FLEGEL] Why are you
pointing that thing at me?

00:21:13.732 --> 00:21:15.567 position:50% align:center
I'm the one in charge.

00:21:33.418 --> 00:21:34.711 position:50% align:center
As I thought.

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:37.964 position:50% align:center
So headstrong yet all he
really did was stall for us.

00:21:38.048 --> 00:21:40.508 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
It was the natural outcome.

00:21:40.592 --> 00:21:43.720 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON] Which is fine.
He served his purpose.

00:21:44.763 --> 00:21:46.973 position:50% align:center
Soon it will be time.

00:23:33.663 --> 00:23:34.956 position:50% align:center
[BALTHAUSER]
No matter what transpires,

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.416 position:50% align:center
keep the princess safe.

00:23:36.499 --> 00:23:37.792 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] Guess you'll have to
force the truth out of me.

00:23:37.876 --> 00:23:39.336 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
So, yes. I'm very sure.

00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:41.421 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA] My lord,
promise me something first!

00:23:41.504 --> 00:23:43.423 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] I have a score to
settle with these monsters!

00:23:43.506 --> 00:23:45.675 position:50% align:center
So, you all go on without me!
