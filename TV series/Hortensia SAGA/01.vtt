[NARRATOR] On the Iepetas
Peninsula lies Hortensia,

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:09.698 position:50% align:center
a great kingdom
more than 700 years old.

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:11.533 position:50% align:center
While Hortensia was haunted by

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:13.993 position:50% align:center
the threat of invasion
from surrounding nations

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:16.121 position:50% align:center
who desired its fertile soil,

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:20.000 position:50% align:center
it had two territories acting
as its sword and shield.

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:22.419 position:50% align:center
Thanks to Olivier and Camellia,

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.087 position:50% align:center
the prosperous
kingdom was able to

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.924 position:50% align:center
remain unscathed by
the brutal fires of war.

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:33.138 position:50% align:center
Then came December 5th
of the year 767, New Holy Era.

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:37.517 position:50% align:center
Grand Duke Rugis F. Camellia,
of the principality of Camellia,

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.854 position:50% align:center
suddenly rose up in revolt
against the kingdom.

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:43.565 position:50% align:center
Though an overthrow of
the capital was prevented,

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:45.859 position:50% align:center
the king of Hortensia was slain,

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:49.070 position:50% align:center
and his daughter, Princess
Marielle, has disappeared.

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:51.990 position:50% align:center
Due to his sister's absence
and his father's death,

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:55.118 position:50% align:center
young Prince Charlot
assumed the throne.

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.662 position:50% align:center
The rebellion sparked
just as monsters

00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:59.956 position:50% align:center
began appearing in Hortensia.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.958 position:50% align:center
Thus, the once peaceful
land was ushered

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:06.171 position:50% align:center
into a new age of
turmoil and despair.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.467 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] If I hadn't
been there, I wouldn't believe

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.385 position:50% align:center
what we saw in that throne room.

00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:14.346 position:50% align:center
A giant werewolf,
the likes of which

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:16.306 position:50% align:center
I've only heard of in legends.

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:19.726 position:50% align:center
I'm proud to say your father
didn't back down a single step.

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:21.686 position:50% align:center
He fought to protect
the princess even when

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.647 position:50% align:center
he had death
staring him in the face.

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.066 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Fighting for as long as he lived

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:28.610 position:50% align:center
in defense of the country.

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:31.237 position:50% align:center
That sounds like how he'd
want to meet his end.

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.406 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
Are you all right?

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.034 position:50% align:center
I know this is a lot to take in.

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:39.746 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] From here on, I'm going
to have to govern Albert.

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:42.540 position:50% align:center
Which means I'll have to
dry my tears sooner or later.

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:46.211 position:50% align:center
Besides, I made
my father a promise.

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:49.839 position:50% align:center
I told him I'd become
a great knight, like he was.

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:52.008 position:50% align:center
Ambitious of you.

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:54.260 position:50% align:center
Uncle, I was hoping
that you could train me

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:57.972 position:50% align:center
to better wield a sword so that
I can keep my promise to him.

00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:01.059 position:50% align:center
Fine by me. On one condition.

00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:03.311 position:50% align:center
I'd prefer if you called me
Maurice from now on.

00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:05.063 position:50% align:center
"Uncle" doesn't sound right.

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:06.523 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Hm?

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:08.400 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] 'Specially when
you take into consideration

your own castle here.

What's that have
to do with training?

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:14.656 position:50% align:center
I'm officially resigning
from the royal order

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:16.866 position:50% align:center
and staying in Albert with you.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.451 position:50% align:center
Settling down and
serving my nephew

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:20.370 position:50% align:center
actually sounds kinda nice.

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:24.499 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE chuckles]

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:28.128 position:50% align:center
Well, to be completely honest,
I do, my lord.

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:29.504 position:50% align:center
Thank you, sir.

00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:32.340 position:50% align:center
Oh, um, thanks, Maurice.

00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:35.135 position:50% align:center
There! Now that wasn't so hard.

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:38.013 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA] Come quick!
It's absolutely terrible!

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:41.099 position:50% align:center
Marius has somehow
vanished into thin air!

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.310 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA] And right when
he was acting healthier

00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:46.187 position:50% align:center
and moving around more, too.

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:49.274 position:50% align:center
You don't think that
he ran away, do you?

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:51.401 position:50% align:center
I doubt that's even
a slight possibility.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:52.736 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA]
How can you be so sure?

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:55.196 position:50% align:center
It's not like he told us
where he was going!

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.491 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] He's had
a rough past few days, too.

00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
Probably needs
a little time to himself.

00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:11.296 position:50% align:center
[QOO]
Marius, you'll worry the others

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:13.298 position:50% align:center
if you wander off on your own.

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.675 position:50% align:center
Let's go back, moru.

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:19.596 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but could you
please leave me be?

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.222 position:50% align:center
[QOO]
Moru.

00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:30.190 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] I heard Marius's home
was burned to the ground

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:32.609 position:50% align:center
during the rebellion
at the capital.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:34.235 position:50% align:center
He lost his family in the fire,

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:37.238 position:50% align:center
but then your old man
came along and helped him out.

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:46.081 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Father.

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:47.707 position:50% align:center
Fernando.

00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:49.209 position:50% align:center
Leon.

00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:51.127 position:50% align:center
They're all dead.

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:57.258 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] I'm sorry, Charlot.
You're all alone now.

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:00.637 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
So, this is where you went.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.515 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Alfred? Where'd you come from?

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:06.351 position:50% align:center
Wow, she was right.

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:08.269 position:50% align:center
You do look healthier.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.272 position:50% align:center
I take it you don't
like living here?

00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:13.149 position:50% align:center
That's not true at all.

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:17.320 position:50% align:center
I heard you've lost
family members as well.

00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:18.446 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:20.532 --> 00:12:23.451 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] This place.
It's my family's gravesite.

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:25.412 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:29.082 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] My mother and sister
were laid to rest here.

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:32.794 position:50% align:center
And, pretty soon,
my father will join them.

00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:37.590 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Father, he--he was
always risking his life,

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:40.719 position:50% align:center
and he always stuck
to his code of chivalry.

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:44.639 position:50% align:center
For his kingdom and for
the sake of the princess.

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:46.725 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS cries]

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:48.309 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:51.354 position:50% align:center
I never thought
it'd be like this.

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:53.940 position:50% align:center
That things would
end up so terribly!

00:12:54.024 --> 00:12:55.650 position:50% align:center
How could I?

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] I never thought
it'd be like this either.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:05.577 position:50% align:center
Yet somehow, it is.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.247 position:50% align:center
I get the feeling that you've
endured a lot of hardships.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.958 position:50% align:center
You're still alive, though.

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:15.420 position:50% align:center
I lost my father, and that's
a scar that will never fade,

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:18.048 position:50% align:center
but what I haven't
lost yet is hope.

00:13:19.174 --> 00:13:22.177 position:50% align:center
Meeting the boy Father saved
gave me that hope.

00:13:24.054 --> 00:13:25.513 position:50% align:center
Listen, Marius.

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:28.767 position:50% align:center
The toughest hardship
we face is life itself,

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
but we keep on living anyway.

00:13:32.354 --> 00:13:35.148 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
So, what do you want to do now?

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:36.566 position:50% align:center
Right now?

00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:42.655 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Right now!

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:46.951 position:50% align:center
What I want is to
become stronger!

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:47.952 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:50.205 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
I need to become stronger!

00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:53.625 position:50% align:center
So, my tears have to
dry sometime, right?

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:12.352 position:50% align:center
As soon as we clear this forest,

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:14.437 position:50% align:center
we'll be at the
Erp Heights front line.

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:17.440 position:50% align:center
If it's as our scout said,

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:19.609 position:50% align:center
their advance force
is just one unit.

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:21.403 position:50% align:center
Once we meet up
with our allies here,

00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:22.696 position:50% align:center
then we'll attack.

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:23.988 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHTS]
Right!

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:27.867 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the save.

00:14:27.951 --> 00:14:30.995 position:50% align:center
We're about to fight
a battle. Stay on guard.

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:32.247 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
You really have become quite

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.249 position:50% align:center
the dependable squire, Marius.

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:36.751 position:50% align:center
It's a duty I take
very seriously.

00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:39.629 position:50% align:center
Someone has to pick up the slack
whenever you fall short.

00:14:39.713 --> 00:14:42.590 position:50% align:center
You can count on me to have
your back out there, Alfred.

00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:44.217 position:50% align:center
Plus, it's about time.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.553 position:50% align:center
I finally get to
show off my training!

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:48.888 position:50% align:center
But you won't get
too carried away. Right?

00:14:48.972 --> 00:14:50.557 position:50% align:center
Uh, right.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.143 position:50% align:center
Though our allies' forces
are more than ample,

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50% align:center
it's still your first time
seeing a fight. Be careful.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.732 position:50% align:center
--Sure.
--Yeah.

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:00.442 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Everyone,
let's get through this

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:02.777 position:50% align:center
with our lives intact
and go home!

00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:12.037 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:15:16.458 --> 00:15:19.336 position:50% align:center
There's just no way.

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:21.504 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
It's a bloodbath.

00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:25.717 position:50% align:center
The main force has been
completely annihilated!

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.595 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED gasps]
Look! There's a survivor!

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:34.976 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] I know those scarlet
colors. Must be Roy's unit.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:36.478 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
What?

00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:38.271 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] We're up against
Camellia's most elite archers.

00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:39.647 position:50% align:center
Everyone, split into teams!

00:15:39.731 --> 00:15:42.192 position:50% align:center
And see to the survivors!

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:43.026 position:50% align:center
Let's go, Marius!

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:44.235 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
Right!

00:15:44.319 --> 00:15:46.196 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Hey! If you're
well enough to walk,

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.322 position:50% align:center
we'll get you out right now!

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:48.198 position:50% align:center

You're not hurt, are you?

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:25.610 position:50% align:center
I'm, uh, fine, thanks.

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:27.862 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Where'd
those knights go?

00:16:27.946 --> 00:16:29.197 position:50% align:center
They're over there.

casting your pride

The precious keepsake

Which, of course, would make you
the current lord of Albert.

You're finally awake.
I was so worried!

00:18:55.677 --> 00:18:59.389 position:50% align:center
If you only knew how long
you've been unconscious for.

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:02.017 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I'm up now.

00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:06.062 position:50% align:center
Do you know where Alfred is?

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:17.365 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Father, why did you
become a knight?

00:19:17.449 --> 00:19:19.909 position:50% align:center
[FERNANDO]
Hmm, I suppose I did it

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:21.953 position:50% align:center
in order to protect
the ones I love.

00:19:22.037 --> 00:19:24.247 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
And who do you love?

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.875 position:50% align:center
[FERNANDO] The king and people
of this land, for starters.

00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:29.377 position:50% align:center
Then there're all of my friends
in the royal order.

00:19:29.461 --> 00:19:31.880 position:50% align:center
But you and Berna are
at the top of that list.

00:19:31.963 --> 00:19:33.882 position:50% align:center
I love you more than anything.

00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:36.634 position:50% align:center
And I'll continue to love you
for as long as I live.

00:19:36.718 --> 00:19:40.472 position:50% align:center
I'll act as the sword and shield
that protect you from harm.

00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:42.432 position:50% align:center
It's my wish for you,
too, though.

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:44.351 position:50% align:center
To be a knight
who's pure of heart.

00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:47.062 position:50% align:center
One who can defend those
he holds most dear.

00:19:47.145 --> 00:19:49.022 position:50% align:center
Well, then that's what I'll do!

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:52.442 position:50% align:center
I promise to make your wish
come true and become a knight!

00:19:53.777 --> 00:19:57.280 position:50% align:center
Father left me all of Albert
so that I could defend it.

00:19:57.364 --> 00:19:59.032 position:50% align:center
I swore to him I'd
protect it because

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:01.618 position:50% align:center
I love its people
as much as he did.

00:20:02.869 --> 00:20:04.037 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
So, this is where you went.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:08.458 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Marius, are you
feeling all right?

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:11.086 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I heard everybody
that went with us

00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:14.172 position:50% align:center
made it back to Albert
safe and sound.

00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:16.049 position:50% align:center
I don't understand
why you're so discouraged.

00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:18.593 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Because that's not good enough.

00:20:18.677 --> 00:20:22.555 position:50% align:center
Even if I give it everything
I have, I'll still fail.

00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:26.726 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm gonna
have to get stronger.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:28.019 position:50% align:center
And I'm talking about
the strength that

00:20:28.103 --> 00:20:30.271 position:50% align:center
has to do with more
than wielding a sword.

00:20:30.355 --> 00:20:33.650 position:50% align:center
Whatever strength you find,
you better save some for me.

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:34.651 position:50% align:center
You mean--?

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:36.444 position:50% align:center
I intend to get
stronger as well!

00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
As your squire, it's the
least I can do. My lord--

00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:43.159 position:50% align:center
Don't try and shoulder this
burden alone when you have me.

00:20:44.661 --> 00:20:48.039 position:50% align:center
I guess I won't. Thanks, Marius.

00:20:48.123 --> 00:20:50.375 position:50% align:center
Now that we've got that
matter all cleared up.

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:51.584 position:50% align:center
We should start
making our way back

00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:53.503 position:50% align:center
since everyone's waiting on you.

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:56.006 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA]
Lord Alfred!

00:20:56.089 --> 00:20:58.008 position:50% align:center
Marius!

00:21:04.222 --> 00:21:07.225 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] It was a historic
tragedy for their kingdom,

00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:09.561 position:50% align:center
but it's what brought
the two of them together.

00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:11.396 position:50% align:center
And, given time,
these young fighters would

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:14.357 position:50% align:center
bring about a new era
for the world they knew.

00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:16.317 position:50% align:center
But the grueling
battles it would take

00:21:16.401 --> 00:21:18.945 position:50% align:center
to reach that future
were yet unbeknownst

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:22.699 position:50% align:center
to the fledgling knight
and his trusty squire.

00:23:02.298 --> 00:23:05.510 position:50% align:center
My lord, the border forces
have been wiped out.

00:23:05.593 --> 00:23:09.139 position:50% align:center
Hortensia won't be taking any
action against us for some time.

00:23:09.222 --> 00:23:12.976 position:50% align:center
What's more, is this should also
serve as an example to Daire.

00:23:13.059 --> 00:23:15.186 position:50% align:center
Excellent work, Roy.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:18.898 position:50% align:center
However, there's a little bit
more to my report.

00:23:18.982 --> 00:23:20.442 position:50% align:center
[RUGIS]
Oh?

00:23:20.525 --> 00:23:26.031 position:50% align:center
[ROY] I came across
Sir Fernando's keepsake.

00:23:26.114 --> 00:23:27.574 position:50% align:center
[RUGIS]
Well then.

00:23:27.657 --> 00:23:30.535 position:50% align:center
Now I have something
to look forward to.

00:23:32.579 --> 00:23:33.580 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
You think this monster is

00:23:33.663 --> 00:23:35.123 position:50% align:center
somehow the exception?
Because I don't.

00:23:35.206 --> 00:23:36.875 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] I wish that I could do
as much as you do, Nonnoria.

00:23:36.958 --> 00:23:38.460 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA] I won't even
entertain that notion

00:23:38.543 --> 00:23:39.586 position:50% align:center
when you practically have

00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:41.379 position:50% align:center
the world on your
shoulders as it is!

00:23:41.463 --> 00:23:42.922 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] I just really
can't stand wolves.

00:23:43.006 --> 00:23:44.299 position:50% align:center
[NONNORIA]
But so what?

00:23:44.382 --> 00:23:46.885 position:50% align:center
No time to second guess
when time is of the essence!
