[MESSENGER 4A]
I bring news, my king!

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.891 position:50% align:center
Both the Camellian
and Dairen armies

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:19.894 position:50% align:center
are exhibiting menacing
behavior near the borders.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:24.941 position:50% align:center
What shall we do, Sire?
Any thoughts?

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:27.610 position:50% align:center
My thoughts are
to let you decide.

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:34.159 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] I think it best
we dispatch reinforcements

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:36.453 position:50% align:center
from the Ecclesiastical Order.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:37.787 position:50% align:center
Very well, then.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.914 position:50% align:center
The arrangements
will be made swiftly.

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:40.999 position:50% align:center
[MESSENGER 4A]
Sir!

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.419 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] So, this Georg
fellow you mentioned

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:45.712 position:50% align:center
is a shady one, yeah?

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:48.048 position:50% align:center
I've no conclusions, as of yet.

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:49.549 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] You aren't
thinking of starting trouble

00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:51.051 position:50% align:center
in the capital, are you?

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:53.386 position:50% align:center
I'd rather act
my age, thank you.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.057 position:50% align:center
Truth be told, trivial stuff
like that just ain't my style.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.935 position:50% align:center
The only thing I wanna do
in the capital is have some fun.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.190 position:50% align:center
Bye! I packed plenty
of food and medicine

00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:07.317 position:50% align:center
and whatever else
I could think of for you!

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.651 position:50% align:center
Please, be careful!

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.404 position:50% align:center
I hear the capital is just
swarming with monsters!

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:15.825 position:50% align:center
I know that's nothing new.
But I still hope they stay safe.

00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:50.253 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
The Daire Empire.

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:53.923 position:50% align:center
This nation lies on the eastern
side of the Iepetas Peninsula

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:56.134 position:50% align:center
and has been plotting to
invade and overthrow

00:02:56.217 --> 00:03:00.055 position:50% align:center
the Kingdom of Hortensia
for over seven hundred years.

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:02.307 position:50% align:center
Their plans of conquest
had been quelled

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.018 position:50% align:center
by Hortensia's border defense.

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:07.228 position:50% align:center
The dominion of Camellia.

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:09.522 position:50% align:center
However, it was
clear that Camellia

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:11.483 position:50% align:center
no longer held favor
with the kingdom

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:13.693 position:50% align:center
following Duke Rugis's uprising.

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:17.947 position:50% align:center
They joined forces with Daire
and changed from ally to foe.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.496 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Are you
absolutely sure about this?

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.623 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Sure about what?

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:28.249 position:50% align:center
Before, when we
received that summons

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:29.876 position:50% align:center
from the Orthodox Church,

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.629 position:50% align:center
you refused to go
to the capital.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:33.922 position:50% align:center
Well, I won't lie to you.

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:36.675 position:50% align:center
I am not exactly
happy right now.

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:37.967 position:50% align:center
But, when we were
in Petale Village

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.803 position:50% align:center
and those Ecclesiastical
Knights attacked us

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.680 position:50% align:center
without being provoked,

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:45.058 position:50% align:center
it made me realize
something is clearly amiss.

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:47.268 position:50% align:center
I can't sit idly by
with that knowledge

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:50.939 position:50% align:center
in the back of my mind.
I have to act!

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:55.944 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE gasps] Hey!
What the hell happened here?

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
What seems to be
the problem, Deflotte?

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:58.947 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center
They were all merchants.
What a terrible fate.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.207 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
Their cargo's still here,

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.419 position:50% align:center
which means it wasn't
the work of bandits.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.421 position:50% align:center
No. Monsters did this.

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.131 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:19.592 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?
Is something there, moru?

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:25.306 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] Sure enough.
I knew I saw this wagon move.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.891 position:50% align:center
There're survivors?

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:33.690 position:50% align:center
Children?

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:36.026 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS gasps]
Are the two of you okay?

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.153 position:50% align:center
Can you tell us
what happened here?

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:40.405 position:50% align:center
Probably not.

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:42.824 position:50% align:center
They look like they
came from Daire, don't they?

00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:45.410 position:50% align:center
So, I doubt they
understand our language.

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:47.328 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] My guess is
these kids were wandering

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:48.955 position:50% align:center
too close to the border one day

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.166 position:50% align:center
and those late merchants
snatched 'em up.

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:52.208 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
They were slave traders?

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.002 position:50% align:center
[QOO]
That's awful, moru.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:56.713 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] Question is what're
we going to do with them?

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.798 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Varila Village is up ahead.

00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:01.343 position:50% align:center
Maybe their lord
can give them a home.

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:03.345 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
That sounds reasonable.

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:06.514 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
You have nothing to fear now.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.685 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED gasps]

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:23.823 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] It's a lot more
rundown than I expected.

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:25.408 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] You'd think
a town built for travelers

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:27.869 position:50% align:center
to stop and rest
would be thriving.

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:29.287 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Blame the monsters.

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:32.165 position:50% align:center
It's more dangerous than fun
to travel these days.

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:34.209 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] We came here
for a reason, didn't we?

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:36.002 position:50% align:center
Let's figure out
where the lord is.

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:38.254 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE gasps]
You can leave that to me!

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.673 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:44.219 position:50% align:center
I beg your pardon, beautiful,
but can you help us?

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:46.888 position:50% align:center
We're humble travelers
just passing by.

00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:49.057 position:50% align:center
We need to speak with
the lord of Varila.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.226 position:50% align:center
Might you direct us to him?

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:52.477 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.688 position:50% align:center
I guess that's one way
to do it, moru.

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.231 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.900 position:50% align:center
I'd direct you if the lord was
actually here, but he isn't.

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:01.903 position:50% align:center
Then, will you join me
for some tea? We'll wait for--

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:05.365 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] Hey! That's enough
out of you, lover boy!

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:08.243 position:50% align:center
Any idea when this absent lord
of yours is set to return?

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:10.620 position:50% align:center
No, no. You misunderstood me.

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:12.122 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:15.750 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, sir, but our village
isn't what it used to be.

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:19.337 position:50% align:center
Not since monsters began
taking the place of visitors.

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:21.715 position:50% align:center
And to make matters worse,
our lord did nothing

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:24.050 position:50% align:center
but siphon away
our taxes and food.

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:26.469 position:50% align:center
Until eventually he abandoned
the village altogether

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:27.762 position:50% align:center
and went to live in the capital.

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:28.638 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:30.807 position:50% align:center
He abandoned all of his people?

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.435 position:50% align:center
There is no way
that can be allowed!

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:35.270 position:50% align:center
It's okay, though.

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:37.272 position:50% align:center
After he made his
decision to leave,

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:40.108 position:50% align:center
we made our own decision
to remodel his mansion

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:42.902 position:50% align:center
and transform it into a church.

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:45.488 position:50% align:center
Things got so bad 'cause
we didn't have a church.

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:46.448 position:50% align:center
Now we will.

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:47.907 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's only natural for

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:50.535 position:50% align:center
God to forsake a village
that didn't praise Him.

00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:53.371 position:50% align:center
Once we get this built,
we'll have our lives back.

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:55.498 position:50% align:center
I'm sure the monsters
will leave, too!

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:58.752 position:50% align:center
No. It doesn't work like that.
Building a church won't do--

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:00.503 position:50% align:center
Just leave it alone, Marius.

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:03.298 position:50% align:center
How can I? They're wasting
resources on building

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:05.425 position:50% align:center
something that won't
do them any good.

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:07.010 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
I know.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:10.972 position:50% align:center
That said, the one thing this
is doing is giving them hope.

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:14.267 position:50% align:center
Far be it from us to strip
that away from these people.

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:22.442 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE sighs]
Time to take a load off.

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:25.820 position:50% align:center
By the way, my lord.
What do we do with these two?

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:27.989 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] This village can't
afford to take in outsiders,

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:29.574 position:50% align:center
let alone children.

00:07:29.657 --> 00:07:31.951 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Which is why they're
coming with us to the capital.

00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:35.997 position:50% align:center
Fair enough.
Hear that? Good news!

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:41.086 position:50% align:center
Don't have to reject me
that hard, do ya?

00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:43.630 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] It seems our
new companions have taken

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:45.715 position:50% align:center
quite a liking to Alfred.

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:49.761 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] You've been stuck
in a carriage for too long.

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:52.263 position:50% align:center
We could play cards
to liven things up.

00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:58.478 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Hm? Oh.
How 'bout the four of us play?

00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:01.356 position:50% align:center
Hey! Do you want
some fruit, too?

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:04.734 position:50% align:center
[gasps] They must
not be that hungry.

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:08.196 position:50% align:center
All right. It's time for bed.

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:13.034 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED gasps] This bed wasn't
built with three people in mind!

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:18.957 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] I won't be far,
so you two sleep over here.

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:25.839 position:50% align:center
We're all nice to them,

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:28.091 position:50% align:center
but you're the only one
they've gotten attached to.

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.802 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'm just used to
handling children

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:32.595 position:50% align:center
because I used to
play with Berna.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.639 position:50% align:center
I have a little bro--

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:35.682 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:40.478 position:50% align:center
Uh, never mind.
I'm going to sleep.

00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:41.771 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Sure.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:49.237 position:50% align:center
Those were the days.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:59.998 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Good night.

00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:08.381 position:50% align:center
[THALIA] Who would have
guessed that things

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:10.258 position:50% align:center
would turn out this way?

00:09:10.342 --> 00:09:11.885 position:50% align:center
[ELVA] You know,
you're the one who said you

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:13.845 position:50% align:center
wanted to ride in
the wagon, Thalia.

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:15.638 position:50% align:center
[THALIA]
I don't remember saying that.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:16.848 position:50% align:center
[ELVA]
Well, you did.

00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:18.308 position:50% align:center
[THALIA]
No, I didn't.

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:21.728 position:50% align:center
[ELVA] You did. Because now
it's my turn to be right.

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.813 position:50% align:center
'Kay. Then I said it.

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:25.899 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:29.110 position:50% align:center
[THALIA] Since it is, in fact,
your turn to be right, Elva,

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:31.446 position:50% align:center
what do you think we should do?

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:32.947 position:50% align:center
[ELVA]
I can't explain why,

00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:35.742 position:50% align:center
but I really like
that man who found us.

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.494 position:50% align:center
[THALIA]
Yes. Me, too.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:38.578 position:50% align:center
So then?

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:42.332 position:50% align:center
[ELVA] Mm-hmm.
We wait a little longer.

00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:00.350 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE sighs]
Finally reached the capital.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:02.602 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Extra emphasis on "finally."

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:03.687 position:50% align:center
Listen, Qoo.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.105 position:50% align:center
Please stay hidden
while we're here.

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:05.980 position:50% align:center
Can you do that?

00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:07.941 position:50% align:center
But of course, moru!

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:10.652 position:50% align:center
[BERTRAND] Well, well.
Look what the horse dragged in.

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:12.779 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
Bertrand! How goes?

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:15.240 position:50% align:center
Haven't seen your face
around here in a while!

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:18.243 position:50% align:center
My lord wanted to make this
trip, so I'm here on his behalf.

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:20.578 position:50% align:center
Good seeing you.
It's been too long.

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:23.581 position:50% align:center
Hold on. You're Fernando's
boy, aren't you?

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:28.920 position:50% align:center
You're so tall I didn't
recognize ya! [laughs]

00:10:29.004 --> 00:10:31.423 position:50% align:center
Nice to see that you're
as robust as you ever were.

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:33.466 position:50% align:center
Huh? Am I seeing things,

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.385 position:50% align:center
or are those
little ones Dairens?

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:36.678 position:50% align:center
They are.

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:39.097 position:50% align:center
We, uh, helped 'em out of
an unfortunate mishap.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.599 position:50% align:center
Oh. How lucky for them.

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:44.102 position:50% align:center
Normally, I'd suggest taking
them to the orphanage,

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:47.022 position:50% align:center
but there's one problem.

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:50.859 position:50% align:center
People don't exactly take kindly
to Dairens these days.

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:54.070 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:57.532 position:50% align:center
I'll give you a hand
with this, anyway! [laughs]

00:10:57.615 --> 00:11:00.160 position:50% align:center
To the orphanage! Let's go!

00:11:00.243 --> 00:11:02.662 position:50% align:center
Hey, hold on for just a minute,
Commander Bertrand!

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:04.706 position:50% align:center
[BERTRAND]
Huh? Sure.

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:07.000 position:50% align:center
Listen to me. Both of you.

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:09.002 position:50% align:center
I want you to accompany
the commander.

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:11.546 position:50% align:center
Just in case there's
trouble along the way.

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:12.756 position:50% align:center
While you're doing that,

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:15.216 position:50% align:center
Maurice and I will go
deliver our reports.

00:11:17.469 --> 00:11:18.845 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
As you wish.

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:22.599 position:50% align:center
We have to part ways now.

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:24.059 position:50% align:center
But you'll be okay.

00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:26.853 position:50% align:center
The capital's orphanage
is a safe place.

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:33.568 position:50% align:center
How 'bout I buy you a drink
after we run our little errand?

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.362 position:50% align:center
The capital does have
the best drinks!

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:39.115 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah! I like you already!

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:41.159 position:50% align:center
[BERTRAND] Because you
like alcohol already!

00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:42.786 position:50% align:center
[BERTRAND laughs]

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:45.038 position:50% align:center
Charlot.

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:48.792 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] Marius! As soon as
we drop these two off--

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:50.210 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:54.297 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Wait, where'd the kids go?

00:11:54.381 --> 00:11:56.633 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] No! They were
right behind me!

00:11:57.884 --> 00:12:00.637 position:50% align:center
You were attacked by
Ecclesiastical Knights?

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.555 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Yes. It happened when we were

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:06.643 position:50% align:center
investigating Petale Village
under your orders, sir.

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.144 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see.

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:11.398 position:50% align:center
You're wondering if they acted
under my orders as well.

00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:15.402 position:50% align:center
I swear on the blood
and soul in my body.

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:18.863 position:50% align:center
I did not send you out there
just to have you struck down.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.408 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.660 position:50% align:center
We had a feeling that
would be your response.

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.203 position:50% align:center
Which, of course,
is why we came

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:27.038 position:50% align:center
and asked you personally.

00:12:27.122 --> 00:12:29.290 position:50% align:center
Our deaths would be
of no benefit to you.

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:31.042 position:50% align:center
Sir, something's wrong.

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:32.460 position:50% align:center
And if you have any idea as to

00:12:32.544 --> 00:12:36.172 position:50% align:center
what that something
may be, tell us. Please.

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:44.055 position:50% align:center
Let me start by saying
the Orthodox Church

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:47.392 position:50% align:center
is by no means
a monolithic organization.

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:49.978 position:50% align:center
And as for Petale's
quarantine order,

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:51.771 position:50% align:center
it's clear to me now
there is something at work

00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:55.400 position:50% align:center
in the shadows that was never
in my control to begin with.

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:58.069 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't have been attacked
if that were not the case.

00:12:58.153 --> 00:12:59.320 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately.

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:02.198 position:50% align:center
Somebody doesn't want
you snooping around.

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.702 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] There's an individual
within the Orthodox Church

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:07.662 position:50% align:center
who knows my tendencies
and is able to

00:13:07.746 --> 00:13:11.583 position:50% align:center
engage the Ecclesiastical
Knights without my knowledge.

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:14.836 position:50% align:center
It's the one person I believe
is capable of this.

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:16.796 position:50% align:center
It has to be.

00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:20.008 position:50% align:center
[rumbling]

00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:20.842 position:50% align:center
[GEORG]
Hm?

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:22.218 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:24.763 position:50% align:center
Come quick, Captain!
Monsters are in the cathedral!

00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:25.847 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:36.691 position:50% align:center
[ROY] Did you really send them
to the capital of Hortensia?

00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:37.984 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me she's the one

00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:40.737 position:50% align:center
who's pulling the
strings on this.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.322 position:50% align:center
[RUGIS]
Perhaps.

00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:45.658 position:50% align:center
[ROY] And what, may I ask, did
you order them to do exactly?

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:47.952 position:50% align:center
Nothing of particular of merit.

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:50.372 position:50% align:center
I thought they might be bored,
so I suggested they go out and

00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:53.249 position:50% align:center
see some sights,
like the capital.

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:55.710 position:50% align:center
Oh, and then,
I told them if they find

00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:59.297 position:50% align:center
what I've been looking for,
bring it back to me.

00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:01.466 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Well? Any luck?

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:04.511 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS] Mm-hm. Sorry.
It's my fault.

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:06.888 position:50% align:center
Why did I take my eyes off them?

00:14:07.806 --> 00:14:09.015 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:10.892 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
What is that?

00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:14.312 position:50% align:center
[MARIUS]
The cathedral!

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:18.858 position:50% align:center
[ECCLESIASTICAL KNIGHT 4B]
Your Holiness!

00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:20.860 position:50% align:center
Yes, what is it?

00:14:20.944 --> 00:14:22.570 position:50% align:center
Please! Run--

00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:27.992 position:50% align:center
[ELVA]
Hmm, so this is the cathedral.

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:30.286 position:50% align:center
[THALIA]
I wonder if it's here or not.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.789 position:50% align:center
Just who are you people?

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:36.793 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! This one's still alive!
That's really impressive!

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:38.628 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 4C groans]

00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:39.671 position:50% align:center
[ECCLESIASTICAL KNIGHT 4B]
Please, run away!

00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:41.423 position:50% align:center
I'll buy you some ti--

00:14:43.258 --> 00:14:44.426 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:46.469 position:50% align:center
[ELVA] If he's "His Holiness,"
he's the pope!

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:48.471 position:50% align:center
[THALIA] Which means
our task is complete.

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:50.181 position:50% align:center
We actually pulled it off!

00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:52.642 position:50% align:center
That we did, Elva.

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:54.185 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON]
What do you want?

00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:57.105 position:50% align:center
[ELVA] The thing!
What else would we want?

00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:59.607 position:50% align:center
We were told to
bring it back with us.

00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:04.029 position:50% align:center
You have it, right?
And by "it," we mean the relic.

00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:05.280 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:08.700 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] The pope is the heart
of the Orthodox Church.

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:11.244 position:50% align:center
We cannot afford to lose him!

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:12.495 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:18.126 position:50% align:center
[GEORG]
That's the devil's power!

00:15:18.209 --> 00:15:20.962 position:50% align:center
Those can only be summoned
using foreign magic!

00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:23.089 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] I don't care if
they're magic or mortal.

00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:24.341 position:50% align:center
I'm takin' 'em out!

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:26.176 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
Well, if it isn't the cavalry.

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:27.385 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:39.356 position:50% align:center
[DEVILS growl]

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.778 position:50% align:center
Is there no end to them?

00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:46.696 position:50% align:center
The person responsible
for summoning them

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.281 position:50% align:center
must be nearby.

00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:51.326 position:50% align:center
They're most likely
inside the cathedral.

00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:56.915 position:50% align:center
[BERTRAND chuckles]
Take this!

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:02.879 position:50% align:center
And that's how you clear a path!

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:06.132 position:50% align:center
Thank you, sir.
Your effort won't be in vain.

00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:08.510 position:50% align:center
Now let's go rescue the pope!

00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:09.886 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Right!

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:12.180 position:50% align:center
[ELVA] Come on!
We know you have the relic.

00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:15.058 position:50% align:center
So, stop wasting time
and hand it over!

00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:18.645 position:50% align:center
[THALIA] I suppose we could
try something else.

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:22.565 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] Are you all right,
Your Holiness?

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:25.235 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:26.736 position:50% align:center
It's our favorite person!

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.572 position:50% align:center
We really appreciate you all
bringing us to the capital!

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:32.325 position:50% align:center
We've had an amazing time!

00:16:32.409 --> 00:16:36.496 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
No. So, all of this chaos

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:38.581 position:50% align:center
was at the hands of you two?

00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:40.709 position:50% align:center
You summoned those
monsters here,

00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:42.877 position:50% align:center
and slaughtered these men?

00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:45.588 position:50% align:center
Yep! We killed every
single one of them!

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:48.091 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] But why?
Why would you do this?

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:51.219 position:50% align:center
[THALIA, ELVA] Huh? Why else?
Because there's nothing

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:53.471 position:50% align:center
more fun than killing people!

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:57.684 position:50% align:center
[ELVA] We're also doing
a little favor for Rugis.

00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:58.935 position:50% align:center
For Rugis?

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:01.646 position:50% align:center
Must be Camellian assassins!

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.024 position:50% align:center
[THALIA] We were originally
gonna slit all of your throats

00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:05.442 position:50% align:center
when we first met you.

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:07.360 position:50% align:center
[ELVA] But since we
came to like you, Mister,

00:17:07.444 --> 00:17:09.696 position:50% align:center
we decided to let you
and your friends live.

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:10.989 position:50% align:center
[THALIA]
So, don't make us regret it

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:13.074 position:50% align:center
by getting in our way now, okay?

00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:15.493 position:50% align:center
[ELVA]
That's fair. Right, Mister?

00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:18.830 position:50% align:center
What're you doing?

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:20.707 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
What do you think?

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.292 position:50% align:center
I'm going to stop you!

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:23.710 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:26.254 position:50% align:center
Just because you're kids,
don't think we won't give

00:17:26.338 --> 00:17:28.840 position:50% align:center
everything we've got
to take you down!

00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:31.051 position:50% align:center
[ELVA]
Would you be quiet?

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:34.512 position:50% align:center
[THALIA]
Those who interfere with us...

00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:36.097 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
...will die!

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.520 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE]
Whoa! If that thing had hit us,

00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:44.272 position:50% align:center
there'd be nothing left!

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:46.232 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna miss this time.

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:48.234 position:50% align:center
I hope you like pain!

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.072 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:53.782 --> 00:17:56.326 position:50% align:center
[THALIA gasps]
Where did they go?

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:58.870 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON] You would
do well to remember this!

00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:01.498 position:50% align:center
The vulgar powers of
the devil may be strong,

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:03.083 position:50% align:center
but they will never
be able to stand up

00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:05.794 position:50% align:center
against the power of
righteous teachings!

00:18:05.877 --> 00:18:07.754 position:50% align:center
That's it! That's the relic!

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:08.880 position:50% align:center
[ELVA gasps]

00:18:10.048 --> 00:18:12.258 position:50% align:center
I never intended to
do you any harm.

00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:14.594 position:50% align:center
So, please, stop this now!

00:18:16.388 --> 00:18:18.932 position:50% align:center
[roaring]

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:19.974 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:18:20.058 --> 00:18:21.142 position:50% align:center
It sounds big!

00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:23.603 position:50% align:center
Yes! She came!
She's really here!

00:18:23.687 --> 00:18:26.356 position:50% align:center
[ELVA] She flew all this way
just to save us!

00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:31.444 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:18:35.073 --> 00:18:36.950 position:50% align:center
What the hell is that thing?

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:38.284 position:50% align:center
[GEORG]
A salamandre!

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:40.203 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] It's the
mightiest creature there is

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:42.414 position:50% align:center
in all of Magonian lore.

00:18:42.497 --> 00:18:46.084 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:47.210 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
Who in their right mind would

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:49.629 position:50% align:center
bring salamandres to life?

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.173 position:50% align:center
I'm not afraid of you.

00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:54.175 position:50% align:center
I'll fight you
like the knight I am!

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:55.427 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:59.556 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] I wasn't expecting
such an unusual visitor

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:02.225 position:50% align:center
to grace us with its presence.

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:05.353 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE] Wait. He's the
Black Knight, Didier!

00:19:05.437 --> 00:19:08.398 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] I beseech you,
please protect the pope!

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:10.025 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
Of course.

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:18.241 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] Now that dragons exist,
so too must dragon slayers.

00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:30.337 position:50% align:center
Who's this guy?

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.380 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED] A knight who's on
a completely different level

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:34.424 position:50% align:center
than anyone I've ever met!

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:41.056 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
It may be legendary,

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:43.975 position:50% align:center
but it bleeds just as red
as the next beast.

00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:47.145 position:50% align:center
Which means it has a weakness
that can be exploited.

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:50.315 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right,
crimson dragon?

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
Hey, it's time to move.

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:53.985 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:57.655 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE gasps] The kids're
makin' a break for it!

00:19:58.656 --> 00:20:00.825 position:50% align:center
[ELVA]
See ya later, everybody!

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:02.077 position:50% align:center
[THALIA]
It's been fun!

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
Maybe we can
play again sometime!

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:07.540 position:50% align:center
Ya damn cowards! Get back here!

00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:24.891 --> 00:20:27.394 position:50% align:center
[DEFLOTTE] Damn those brats
to hell and back.

00:20:27.477 --> 00:20:30.522 position:50% align:center
I'll show them no mercy
the next time we meet!

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:34.192 position:50% align:center
[ALFRED]
Yeah. Right.

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:37.237 position:50% align:center
You're not hurt, are you?

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.114 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON]
Mm-mm.

00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:41.700 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] I am terribly
sorry, Your Holiness.

00:20:41.783 --> 00:20:44.411 position:50% align:center
I should've done more
to halt their escape.

00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:46.663 position:50% align:center
Though, it seems all
signs of the other monsters

00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:47.997 position:50% align:center
have vanished as well.

00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:49.582 position:50% align:center
[VALL D'HEBRON]
What of King Charlot?

00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:51.626 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER]
He is safe.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:53.837 position:50% align:center
[GEORG] There's an individual
within the Orthodox Church

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.463 position:50% align:center
who knows my tendencies and is

00:20:55.547 --> 00:20:57.632 position:50% align:center
able to engage the
Ecclesiastical Knights

00:20:57.716 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
without my knowledge.

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:03.596 position:50% align:center
It's the one person
I believe is capable of this.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.974 position:50% align:center
[MAURICE]
So, is it Pope Vall d'Hebron

00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:08.309 position:50% align:center
or the Black Knight, Didier?

00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:37.964 position:50% align:center
[THALIA] Thank you, Theresia!
I love you more than ever!

00:21:38.048 --> 00:21:39.924 position:50% align:center
I love you just as much, though!

00:21:40.008 --> 00:21:42.886 position:50% align:center
I'm relieved that both of you
returned in one piece.

00:21:42.969 --> 00:21:44.471 position:50% align:center
[ELVA] Yeah, but we
weren't able to finish

00:21:44.554 --> 00:21:46.890 position:50% align:center
what we went there for
in the first place.

00:21:46.973 --> 00:21:48.725 position:50% align:center
All we managed to do
was confirm that

00:21:48.808 --> 00:21:51.227 position:50% align:center
the pope really does
have the relic.

00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:55.732 position:50% align:center
Yes. We must inform
Rugis about this.

00:23:33.496 --> 00:23:35.248 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID] When I was younger,
I actually thought

00:23:35.331 --> 00:23:36.708 position:50% align:center
I'd be able to catch up to him.

00:23:36.791 --> 00:23:39.002 position:50% align:center
[DIDIER] You are suspected of
instigating a rebellion.

00:23:39.085 --> 00:23:40.086 position:50% align:center
[ADELHEID]
I should have known you'd be

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:41.296 position:50% align:center
the one calling the shots.

00:23:41.379 --> 00:23:42.380 position:50% align:center
[ROY] If you only knew
the reality of what

00:23:42.464 --> 00:23:44.174 position:50% align:center
this actually means
for the kingdom.

00:23:44.257 --> 00:23:47.052 position:50% align:center
[THERESIA] As of now,
that is the future I saw.
