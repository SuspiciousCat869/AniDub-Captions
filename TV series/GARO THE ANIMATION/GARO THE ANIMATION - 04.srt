1
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:15,125
[GAEL] I will employ all of
my remaining power to see

2
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:17,583
the Madou ring made whole again.

3
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:18,708
[GERMÁN]
León! He's one of them!

4
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,166
[ZARUBA]
My name is Zaruba.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,250
When Garo came
to be, thus did I.

6
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,833
[EMA] Perhaps our paths will
cross again in Santa Bard.

7
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:28,541
[ALFONSO gasps]

8
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:31,000
I defy you in the
name of Valiante!

9
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,208
Know you this, demon!

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,208
[ALFONSO groans]

11
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,125
[gasps]

12
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:58,708
In such armor, he's an echo of
Valiante's legendary savior:

13
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,416
The Knight of Light!

14
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:12,416
Hurry up, let's go.

15
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,333
[gasps]

16
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:20,291
[RAFAEL] Where the human heart
embraces evil, Horrors feast,

17
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,333
possessing those
who invite them.

18
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,333
Such vile, poisonous creatures

19
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:27,208
have been hunted
since time out of mind.

20
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:30,333
Relentlessly pursued
by Men of the Armor:

21
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,666
The Makai Knights!

22
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:14,458
[LEÓN] Old man. Wait,
where are we going?

23
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,125
Hey, are you listening to me?

24
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:19,500
--[GERMÁN] No. Come again?
--[LEÓN] Of course you're not.

25
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:20,875
[LEÓN]
Where are we even headed?

26
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,541
These woodlands are far off
from our original route.

27
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,041
Oh, you noticed that, did you?

28
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,833
Well, then, suppose I'd
best keep you informed.

29
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,166
There's a village nearby,

30
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,916
lots of dark rumors
have come out of late.

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,333
The map says we should
be right on top of it.

32
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,958
This is waste of our time.

33
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,625
No harm in taking
a quick peek, Leon.

34
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:39,833
But you're always going on

35
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,375
about our sacred mission
to vanquish Horrors.

36
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,958
How it's our knightly duty.

37
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,791
[GERMÁN laughs] All right, son.
Heed your father's wisdom.

38
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,500
Sacred missions are all
well and good, my boy,

39
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,291
but sampling the wine and women
of small country towns,

40
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,958
these are the moments you
treasure for a lifetime.

41
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,166
[LEÓN grunts]

42
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,916
[barking]

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,208
[GERMÁN] Now this is
the true countryside.

44
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,500
[LEÓN sighs]

45
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,500
Well this place doesn't
even have a bar!

46
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,541
How's a man supposed
to sample the wine?

47
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,708
[GERMÁN]
Good day, young miss.

48
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,625
Ha, ha, ha!

49
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,166
Ee!

50
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,500
Guess you won't be sampling any
of the local women, either.

51
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,000
[GERMÁN chuckles]

52
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,125
[VILLAGE CHIEF] Your raiment
would name you as travelers.

53
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,083
I am known as the mayor
of our tucked away haven.

54
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,416
What brings you so far afield?

55
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Ah, well met.

56
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,625
[VILLAGE CHIEF grunts]

57
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,625
[GERMÁN]
My son and I are mere pilgrims,

58
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,041
traveling to the Holy Land.

59
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,500
Some small piece of
gossip drew us here.

60
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,541
[laughs] Rumors of the
mysterious always

61
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,708
pique our curiosity.

62
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,708
[VILLAGE CHIEF] It seems
this small gossip of yours

63
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,791
has led you astray. Ours is
a simple village that keeps to

64
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,333
a simple faith. We know
little misfortune here.

65
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:01,458
Oh? We had heard whisperings
of strange disappearances.

66
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,958
A monk and a church official,
if I recall it true.

67
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:08,208
No such thing, good sir,
you must have been mistaken.

68
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:11,458
Truth be told, it is the sudden
appearance of wandering folk

69
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,791
that drives our citizens back
to the safety of their homes.

70
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:18,208
Travelers are often known
to bring ill fortune.

71
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,458
I must insist you
be on your way.

72
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,083
[GERMÁN]
Heh.

73
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,125
[LEÓN exhales]

74
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,250
It appears your leads
were wrong this time.

75
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,791
Come on, let's get outta here.

76
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,833
Why so eager to put
this place behind you?

77
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,000
[LEÓN]
You should know best.

78
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,000
[GERMÁN]
Don't go on about revenge again.

79
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,333
God above!

80
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,375
Sometimes I think you've
been replaced by a Horror!

81
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,625
[gasps] Have you?

82
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,791
[LEÓN gasps]
Get off!

83
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,666
[GERMÁN] This drive for
vengeance will tear you apart.

84
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,250
If you insist on getting torn
to shreds, it's much more fun

85
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,333
if you let women do the honors.

86
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,041
[LEÓN grunts]

87
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,458
[GERMÁN]
Huh?

88
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,541
[BOY A] Hey, maybe you didn't
get it after last time,

89
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:05,125
you gotta pay the toll if you
ever trespass over here again!

90
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,375
[BOY B]
You scared now, boy?

91
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,916
Got no more smart comebacks?

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,250
[BOY C] We'll take
that stupid doll first!

93
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:14,083
Give it here!
I said give it to me!

94
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,000
[BOY C groans]

95
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,958
What'd he do? What happened?

96
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,541
Damn!

97
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,500
[gasps]

98
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,000
[LEÓN]
Let him go!

99
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,958
Three on one's kind of unfair.

100
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,916
[BOY A] We weren't gonna
do nothin' to the kid.

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,250
Oh, I think you were.

102
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,416
Maybe we'll jump in and
even up the numbers a bit,

103
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,625
what do ya think boys?

104
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,541
You should leave this
place while you can.

105
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,750
That's right, the whole
village has been cursed.

106
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:39,000
His mom's an evil witch who
cast a spell on this place!

107
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,291
If you don't get the hell out,
you'll be her next victims!

108
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,000
[BOYS chuckle]

109
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:49,666
Guess the village has
a mystery after all.

110
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,250
You snapped at the hand
of that mean bully.

111
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,958
Thank you.

112
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,583
It's late.

113
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:59,000
We'll take you back home,
if you show us the way.

114
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,333
[ALOIS]
I'm back.

115
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,416
Alois? Welcome home!

116
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,625
[gasps]

117
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,416
[AURELIA]
Oh! And who are these two?

118
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,666
[ALOIS] They saved my doll
and me from the other boys.

119
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,166
Did they now? I do hope you
said thank you, Alois.

120
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,375
[AURELIA sighs]

121
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,583
[GERMÁN clears throat]

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,375
[GERMÁN]
He seems a good boy,

123
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,375
if perhaps a little impetuous.

124
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,291
Truth be told, he only
began acting so heedlessly

125
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,208
after his father passed.
Since then, the only company

126
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,916
he's kept is with that doll
he found in the forest.

127
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,625
Ah, I am grateful, and very
sorry for the trouble, good sir.

128
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,916
Come, none of that.
Call me Germán.

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,375
This is my son, León.

130
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,000
I am Aurelia.

131
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,666
So, a pilgrimage
brings you hence?

132
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,041
[GERMÁN]
Yes and no.

133
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,916
We heard some kind of curse
had befallen the area,

134
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,125
so we thought,
"that's worth a look."

135
00:07:56,208 --> 00:08:00,083
[bell chimes]

136
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,416
[AURELIA]
Ah, you're both witch hunters.

137
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,791
[GERMÁN grunts]

138
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,125
The townsfolk told you I was
some kind of sorceress.

139
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,958
Please, worry not.

140
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,208
I have no curses at my disposal.

141
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,833
Seems only fair to tell you,

142
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,208
my charm is often
called quite bewitching.

143
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,500
[AURELIA laughs]
Are you certain you're a pilgrim

144
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,041
and not a jester, Germán?

145
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,416
[GERMÁN]
Eh? Touché.

146
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,583
[AURELIA] I'm happy to offer
you a place by the fire.

147
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,625
You won't find similar welcome
elsewhere in town, I fear.

148
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh! That would be wonderful.

149
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:30,625
I've spent many nights outside,
nodding off to my son's griping.

150
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:31,791
[LEÓN]
Mm.

151
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,500
[BOY A] Y'know, better
not be lying to us.

152
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,458
[BOY B] You said a band
of thieves hid all their

153
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,958
treasure somewhere out here.

154
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,875
[BOY C] He's not lying if he
knows what's good for him!

155
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,250
[BOY A]
Wait!

156
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,208
You brought us to the swamp?
This place is haunted!

157
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,541
Uh! He's right!

158
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,125

[GERMÁN] Why would folks
think you're a witch?

162
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,541
They've always been
untrusting because

163
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,083
I wasn't born in this village.

164
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,708
My husband was a wanderer,
and one day we settled here.

165
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,250
After he was taken from us,

166
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,833
all manner of ill
fortune befell the town.

167

I'm sure the
disappearances don't help.

168
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:26,500
[AURELIA] True. Nothing
remains of them afterwards,

169
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,958
it's as though they've
fallen into the ether.

170
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:32,000
That's what happened
to the lad's father?

[AURELIA]
No.

172
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,958
He was set upon
by a band of thieves,

173
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,666
on the road to the capital.

174
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,333
That hardly seems enough
to name you a sorceress.

[AURELIA]
I am easy to hate.

176

They need someone to
heap their scorn upon.

Why not the outsider? The one
who never truly belonged.

Why did the Mayor try
so hard to deceive us?

179
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,166
He decried the
disappearances as rumor.

180
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,750
[GERMÁN] He was trying
very hard to hide something,

If some children are missing,
we want to help search for them.

Why don't you tell
us what you know?

[MOTHER] We know that
the witch's child led them

You're no better than her!

you told us that this was
a village of faith, sir.

go there because it's haunted.

[ALOIS]
An old woodcutter's.

He was the person
the villagers used to hate.

[LEÓN]
And, where is he now?

[LEÓN]
Hm?

[ALOIS] Why did you come
to this forgotten village?

286

Because we think that something
here is hurting innocent people.

It's our job to
put an end to it.

No.

We aren't bounty hunters who can
chase after any common brigand.

have to cut down a child.

[LEÓN]
Then don't treat me like one!

A Horror must be ended, be it
in the form of a man or a boy.

remains is a force from

Mm?

I found Alois at a
hut in the forest.

314

[AURELIA] The villagers

But he knew it to be wrong

He tried. He wanted to tell
the Church what they had done.
