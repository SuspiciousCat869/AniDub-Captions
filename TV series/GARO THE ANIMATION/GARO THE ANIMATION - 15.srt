3
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,291
[GERMÁN]
Garo chose you.

4
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:36,125
I suggest you take
pride in that.

5
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:39,666
[ALFONSO] I make this pledge
to you here and now!

6
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,875
Valiante will again
see the light!

7
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,916
[VILLAGERS]
Salve! Salve, Valiante!

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,916
Salve! Salve, Prince Alf--!

00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,083
[JULIO] When I inherited
this place from the boss,

10
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,583
people were really supportive.

11
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:56,291
"You'll do Jordi proud," they
said. "Give it your best."

12
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,750
Of course, to be honest,
even with all the encouragement,

13
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,000
I didn't exactly feel confident.

14
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:04,875
Oh, you can hear me, right?
Great. Visual good? 'Kay.

15
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:06,708
At the moment, we're
in the weapons store

16
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,458
of Jordi's old workshop.

17
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,125
My name is Julio.

18
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:14,000
These guys? Only the most
skilled trades-people in town!

19
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:17,250
All gathered here to marshal
their talents toward one goal.

20
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,875
What might that
goal be, you ask?

21
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,041
Nothing less than creating

22
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,333
the kingdom's Legendary
Knight of Light!

23
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,458
Do you love it?

24
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:27,166
Consider it our gift
to Santa Bard.

25
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:35,166
[JULIO] The great fire that
nearly reduced our town to ashes

26
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,166
wasn't some natural disaster.

27
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,208
But the work of a giant,
diabolical monster.

28
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,958
When all seemed lost,
out of nowhere appeared a hero

29
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,875
who cut the infernal beast
down in one fell swoop.

30
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:47,541
It's was incredible!

31
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:50,791
Legend calls him
the Knight of Light.

32
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:55,666
"Like a wolf forged of gold,
impervious to flame."

33
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,250
That's how eyewitnesses
described him, anyway.

34
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,958
Talk about a beacon of hope.

35
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,875
And this is where we come in.

36
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,666
Amazing as the
Knight of Light is,

37
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,708
he can't be everywhere at once.

38
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:10,375
So, we're crafting a duplicate.

39
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,166
Now, granted from a
logical perspective

40
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,333
the whole idea seems
reasonably impossible.

41
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:18,583
And it is, if I'd tried
to do by myself.

42
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:23,000
Luckily, though, I cast
my net pretty wide.

43
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,291
Ha! Forge one with our
own hands, you say?

44
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,166
There's a capital idea.

45
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,791
Yes! He'll gleam like Phoebus!

46
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,625
The pinnacle of
our craftsmanship!

47
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,125
It will be splendid!

48
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,708
Trust me, Julio,
that sort of strength

49
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,500
only comes at great
personal cost.

50
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,750
A man's heart can only bear
so much enforced solitude.

51
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,291
Señor Pancho, I'm not
exactly sure what you mean,

52
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,666
but be careful.

53
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,041
A worthy enterprise, indeed,

54
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,750
or I don't know the
meaning of the word.

55
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,666
To protect our neighbors
through craftsmanship,

56
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,375
I am thrilled to take part.

57
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,500
Yes, indeed! What are
we waiting for?

58
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:54,083
Let's pool our talents
and get it done.

59
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:58,333
[JULIO] And so, with the best
and brightest under one roof,

60
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:02,666
the time has finally come,
to bring it to life.

61
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,916
[RAFAEL] Where the
human heart embraces evil,

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,333
Horrors feast, possessing
those who invite them.

63
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:13,208
Such vile, poisonous
creatures have been hunted

64
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,333
since time out of mind.

65
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:21,000
Relentlessly pursued by Men of
the Armor: The Makai Knights!

66
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,125
[PANCHO] No, no. The
original didn't have those.

67
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,666
Certainly not there.

68
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,500
[MANUEL]
I'm telling you he did!

69
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,958
I saw it with my own two eyes!

70
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,166
[PETRONA]
Well, either way,

71
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,000
one thing I'm certain
he had was a scarf.

72
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,041
Some shade of red,
if memory serves.

73
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,083
[BRUNO]
Wait, what about his sword?

74
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,750
Idiots. If I didn't know better,

75
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,708
I'd think you'd never
laid eyes on the man.

76
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,958
You're describing a
nobleman on holiday.

77
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,041
His eyes burned like
the embers of a furnace,

78
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,416
of that much I'm sure.

79
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,166
One arm was longer
than the other.

80
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,291
Yes, possibly retractable.

81
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,541
What if we gave him wings?

82
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,708
Do you think we
could make him fly?

83
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,041
Correct me if I'm wrong,

84
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,250
but I believe he could
open his mouth to bellow.

85
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,916
There can be no argument;
his armor glowed like the sun.

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,833
He resembled a wolf all aflame.

87
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,583
So lovely! Whatever else we
do about his appearance,

88
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,916
we mustn't overlook
that dazzling sheen!

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,125
[MANUEL]
Right. Agreed.

90
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,208
Oh, and, Julio, about the head.

91
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,833
Do your damnedest to
make it awe-inspiring.

92
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,250
[JULIO]
Um...

93
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,250
Let's just be sure we're
consulting the drawings, okay?

94
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,208
All the parts have to fit.

95
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,250
[ALL gasping]

96
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,541
[EMERICO]
Well, seems only fair

97
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,333
we should let the
boy hop in first.

98
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,583
[JULIO]
Oh, that's nice of you,

99
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,791
but you all will be the
ones wearing it, not me.

100
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,958
[PANCHO]
Ah, good point.

101
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,250
Didn't think of that.

102
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,541
I'm the burliest here,

103
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,666
so it makes sense for me
to have a go, I s'pose.

104
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,541
[MANUEL]
No offense, Pancho, but, uh,

105
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,250
it seems like it'd be a bit
of a snug fit for you.

106
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:29,458
Hell, Petrona has to make
half your wardrobe.

107
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:33,166
Uh. Perhaps it oughta
be me. I'm trim.

108
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,333
[EMERICO]
Oh-ho! And fit as a fiddle!

109
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:38,000
Excellent idea! I second Bruno!

110
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:43,625
[EMERICO]
Perfect!

111
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,791
[JULIO]
Okay, try moving around.

112
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,333
[BRUNO]
It's too heavy.

113
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,666
I can't so much as wiggle a toe.

114
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,583
Aw, now what? The armor
looks so spectacular!

115
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:00,708
Please tell me this doesn't mean

116
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,041
we have to start back
at square one.

117
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,958
What if we made it
self-propulsive, you know,

118
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,083
something like a
clockwork doll, maybe?

119
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,166
[EMERICO]
Hmm.

120
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,916
That might be
beyond our abilities.

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,750
Besides, it's not a toy!

122
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,166
[JULIO]
Actually, give me a night.

123
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,875
I think Señora Petrona might
really be on to something.

124
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,083
With these modifications,

125
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,083
Señor Bruno should be
able to maneuver it.

126
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,833
[PANCHO]
Hold on a moment there, lad.

127
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,208
Wouldn't these make
the outfit even heavier?

128
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,791
No! Just the opposite!

129
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:47,208
Julio, these modifications
just might be a game-changer.

130
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:50,541
'N fact, you may have stumbled
on the invention of the century!

131
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,666
Oh, this gets my
gears a-turnin'!

132
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,083
Indeed. This is brilliant.

133
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:57,125
I say we enlist Camillo
from the bath house.

134
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,916
[BRUNO] Yes, yes. I know it's
intricate and time consuming,

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,416
but you owe me. Just
follow these schematics.

136
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,333
The sooner you start,
the sooner you can be done.

137
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,583
[EMERICO]
Julio? Believe I'll call it day.

138
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,458
See you bright
and early tomorrow.

139
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:36,000
[EMERICO]
Jordi, I hope you can see this.

140
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,041
The apprentice appears
to be surpassing the master.

141
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:44,541
[EMERICO] I guess the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

142
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,375
[BRUNO]
Sorry for the wait.

143
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,125
Behold!

144
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,541
Yes. The fruits of Camillo's
intense all-nighter.

145
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,916
[JULIO]
Wow!

146
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,541
Señor Camillo's outdone
himself! This is amazing!

147
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,208
[EMERICO] Indeed, so why isn't
the man here to unveil it?

148
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,583
Ah. The poor devil
worked himself sick.

149
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,208
He's laid up now. Got
a touch of the fever.

150
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,458
Not a dull fellow, but
not exactly acclimated

151
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,791
to mental acrobatics
of this caliber.

152
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,500
Well, when he's done
being an invalid,

153
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,166
we'll have to
thank him properly.

154
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,666
Ha! Just look at it!

155
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,166
Now all we have to do is attach
it and we're ready to go.

[metal clinking]

[PETRONA] Let me just
come right out and say it.

160
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:38,166
I think we've gone a tiny bit
afield of our original design.

[MANUEL] Bah! We'll slap
some gold paint on it later.

Huh?

Well, Señor Pancho.

Uhh. What is that?

00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,291
[PANCHO]
Well, it ain't Sunday dinner.

176
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,166
[PANCHO]
This is no normal cut of meat.

177
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,250
See, a thought occurred to me

178
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,375
when I was lookin'
over your plans.

179
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,500
Metal pipes around
the waist are too rigid.

180
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:42,041
Their joints aren't articulated
enough to keep from snapping

181
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,750
under the strain
when the suit moves.

182
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,583
Oh! I follow you! Why,
Pancho, that's ingenious!

183
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,916
I'm embarrassed to say
I don't quite understand.

184
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,416
What's being proposed?

185
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,916
That's it! Of course!

186
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,625
The pipes connecting
the engine to the limbs

187
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,000
aren't flexible enough.

188
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,250
They either restrict our
movement or bust altogether.

189
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,916
But, if we used
another material--

190
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,750
[EMERICO]
Yes! Absolutely right!

191
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,833
If you want durability
and flexibility,

192
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:06,000
this stuff's precisely what you
need. Mother Nature's piping.

193
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,625
Surely he's not suggesting
what I think he is?

194
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,083
Using intestines
instead of pipe? Yes!

195
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,541
You'll need several layers
to withstand the pressure,

196
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,916
and it just so happens I have
some to spare right here.

197
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,041
We'd be fools not to use it.

Hm. Good point.

314
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,250
Easy. It's a bit too
soon to get cocky.

315
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,625
[JULIO]
Stay vigilant.

316
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,458
The sun's only just gone down.

317
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,041
Remember what
the villagers said.

318
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,500
This demon appears under
the cover of darkness.

319
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,458
Julio, would it be all right
if I was off to bed soon?

320
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,333
Anything less than eight
hours of sleep at night

321
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,416
is bad for the skin.

322
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,291
[chuckles]

323
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,333
Huh?

[BEAR growling]

00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,708
[JULIO]
Here it comes!

328
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:41,791
That's your cue!

329
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,250
[BRUNO]
Tally-ho!

330
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,166

00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,041
[PETRONA]
Outstanding!

335
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,458
Bruno took the full brunt
of that creature's momentum

336
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,375
and he's still doing just fine!

337
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,625
[MANUEL]
No!

338
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,708
My invincible armor
is fracturing!

339
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,041
[BRUNO]
Damn it, man!

340
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,958
If you must give a running
commentary, be positive!

341
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,208
I'm all the stands
between this monster

342
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,916
and his reign of terror!

343
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,083
This is the village
where he's been seen.

344
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,166
An unlikely location for the
stories we've been hearing.

345
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,041
[BEAR roars]

346
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,666
[ALFONSO]
We must go!

347
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,833
[GERMÁN]
Right.

348
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:36,625

[BRUNO yells]

351
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,583
[BRUNO]
What? It's a bear!

352
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,125
[EMERICO]
He's stunned!

353
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:55,458
What're you waiting for?! Finish
it with your special attack!

354
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:58,375
Wait, special attack?
That wasn't part of our design.

355
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,500
[BRUNO]
Right! Here we go!

356
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,000
[BRUNO]
Take this, foul thing!

357
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,000
[BRUNO]
Uhh.

358
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,833
Oh, dear!

359
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:19,375
The Garo Punch doesn't appear
to have made much of an impact.

[ALFONSO]
Do you see it?

364
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:40,333
[GERMÁN] Yes.
Quite the spectacle.

365
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:41,791
Huh?

366
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,458
Alfonso, wait, one moment.

367
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,791
I don't believe there's a
role for us to play in this.

368
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,125
The creature is no
more than a bear.

369
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,791
Yes! Now grab on to it
and self-destruct!

370
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,125
What?! That's not--

371
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,458
[gasps]

372
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,625
Señor Bruno! Quick.
Up the pressure to maximum!

373
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,333
The pneumatic
device will explode

374
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,875
and take the bear with it!

375
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,916
Julio! Are you crazy?!
Do you want Bruno to die?!

376
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,750
No, there's an escape hatch.

377
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,125
Trust me. If he wraps
himself around the bear

378
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,125
and slips out through the access
panel we installed in the back,

379
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,875
he'll have time to
clear the blast area

380
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,708
before the suit explodes.

381
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,833
And if the poor man
screws it up, he's dead!

382
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,541
It's all right. Just give
my bones a proper burial.

383
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,750
It's been a pleasure
serving with you.

[BRUNO grunting]

00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,125
Señor Bruno!

387
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,625
You're a tough one, aren't ya?

388
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:58,208
[BRUNO]
Uh.

389
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,000
Sir Germán!

[ALFONSO yelps]

391
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,583
[ALL]
Hm?

392
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,250
Prince Alfonso?!

393
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,750
What are you doing
all the way out here?

394
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,333
Uh--

395
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,000
You see,

396
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:16,500
I heard rumors and thought it
would be prudent to investigate.

397
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,875
Then we stumbled across you

398
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,541
engaged in combat with
this behemoth, so...

399
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,916
Fancy His Highness
traveling all the way here.

400
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,291
This'll be a story to
tell your grandchildren.

401
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,500
[ALFONSO]
Come now.

402
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,125
'Tis a prince's duty
to protect his people.

403
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:34,333
My appearing among you
ought not be so strange.

404
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:37,041
Hm.

405
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:40,833
At any rate,
good work, all of you.

406
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,916
I am deeply impressed.

407

[MAN]
Uh, excuse me.

411
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,625
Not to put a damper on the mood,

412
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,666
but if someone could help
me put out this fire,

413
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,750
that'd be helpful.

414
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,875
It's just shy of the barn.

415
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,750
[GERMÁN] Never underestimate
the people we protect.

416
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,250
They are anything but weak.

417
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,333
Their strength abides
in the everyday.

418
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,583
The ebb and flow of life itself.

419
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:22,958
[ALFONSO]
Yes.

420
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,500
Precisely why I'm devoted.

421
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,708
I wish to see them thrive.

422
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,958
[GARM]
Alas, once planted and watered,

423
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,458
a blossom finds
the hand that tends,

424
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:12,291
and the hand that plucks,
are one and the same.
