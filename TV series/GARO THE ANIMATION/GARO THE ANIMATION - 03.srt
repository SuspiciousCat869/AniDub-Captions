Ema.

00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,583
Oh, yes. Come, my
petulant little vixen!

[LEÓN gasps]

5
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:30,708
The Golden Knight?

6
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:34,041
[GERMÁN] León! You must
turn from the fire within!

7
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,083
You cannot let
yourself be consumed!

[gasping]

[GAEL]
Mado Ring Zaruba.

10
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:50,750
A Horror that has no enmity
toward man is sealed within it,

11
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:55,583
ready to grant its power to he
who forges a contract with it.

12
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:58,916
It shall serve as that knight's
companion all the days

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,625
of his life, ready to
light the way for him.

14
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,875
[RAFAEL] Where the human
heart embraces evil,

15
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:10,333
Horrors feast, possessing
those who invite them.

16
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:13,875
Such vile, poisonous creatures
have been hunted since time

17
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:18,333
out of mind, relentlessly
pursued by Men of the Armor.

18
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:20,541
The Makai Knights!

Hm.

00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,583
"My work on Zaruba draws
near to its completion,

leaves me. Gael."

25
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,458
[GERMÁN]
Can't argue with that.

26
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,416
We'll take to the
road at first light.

27
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,625
He's living in a cave somewhere
between Arzhala and Rox.

28
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,000
What the hell? That's
clean the other way!

29
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,458
I know. it's a pain in the ass.

30
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,291
I guess we could skip it.

31
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:38,750
Not like either of us has burst
into flames anytime lately.

32
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:42,458
[LEÓN grunts]
In time, I'll snuff them.

33
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,791
If you think I need some ring
to serve as a crutch,

34
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,083
you're mistaken.

35
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,416
Easy, I said it mostly in jest.

36
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,583
But a Golden Knight
without his Madou Ring

37
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,166
definitely fights at
a disadvantage.

38
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,375
Better to claim it sooner,
rather than later.

39
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,791
Hey--

40
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,166
[EMA] Quite the intriguing
conversation you're having.

41
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,083
I think I'll join in.

42
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,416
[LEÓN]
You again?

43
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,250
Hard to believe we're all
staying at the same inn.

44
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,291
[chuckles] How serendipitous.

45
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:15,166
[LEÓN] I thought you
hated us Makai Knights!

46
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,500
Oh, I do.

47
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:19,125
Especially those who've only
seen a bared breast

48
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,041
while they're nursing.

49
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,000
What?

50
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,375
[GERMÁN]
Hold your tongue, boy!

51
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,625
I'm sure the pretty lady
meant you no offense by it.

52
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,125
Have a seat!

53
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:29,375
Beg your pardon. I don't think
I ever introduced myself,

54
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,958
I'm Ema Guzmán,
pleased to meet you.

55
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,875
Germán Luís, and this
is my son, León--

56
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,791
[LEÓN]
I'll tell her my damned self!

57
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:37,833
[TAVERN-GOERS gasp]

58
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,666
[EMA]
So, does the boy still have

59
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,541
a problem with
premature conflagration?

60
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:46,791
[LEÓN grunts]

61
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:50,625
Hm. I'm afraid so.
Hence, a trip to see Gael.

62
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,708
Really?! In alchemical circles,

63
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,875
Gael is thought of as a
living legend, even now!

64
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,541
He wasn't even as old as this
sourpuss here by the time he

65
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,958
had invented the Mado Bell!

66
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,958
Indeed, That's why I asked
Gael years ago if he would

67
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,041
repair the Madou Ring for León.

68
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,416
Once you take possession
of the ring, I doubt you'll set

69
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,208
things on fire nearly as much
as you did the other night.

70
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,250
[LEÓN grunts]
That's enough!

71
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,541
Why are you telling her this?

72
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,125
We don't know the first
thing about this woman!

73
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,750
[GERMÁN] No one said
you had to trust 'em!

74
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,625
[EMA]
Huh? Your arm.

75
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,375
[LEÓN grunts]

76
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,833
My God!

77
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,333
[LEÓN grunts]
I'm heading to bed.

78
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,333
León!

79
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:33,666
I didn't mean to offend you.

Uh?

00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,083
My thanks for the drink.
Have a good night, Germán.

84
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:50,291
What? This is beginning
to be a pattern.

85
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,916
Guess I'll drink alone. Barkeep!

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,750
I do not want to see
the bottom of this mug!

87
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,000
[LEÓN]
Well, are we going or what?

[groans]

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,166
[GERMÁN]
I don't see Ema anywhere.

90
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,500
[LEÓN] What did you
expect? A goodbye kiss?

[GAEL]
I'm fine, Marcelo.

00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:45,791
My work here is nearly
at an end, till Roberto

95
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,791
makes his return, this body
of mine must not fail me.

96
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,750
[GAEL]
I will rest awhile.

97
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,875
See that everything's put away.

98
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,416
Right.

[GERMÁN grunts]

104
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,291
Careful!

105
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,000
Damn it all, Gael!
It's me and my boy!

106
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,166
You told us we should
come for the ring!

107
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,208
This is one hell of a welcome!
C'mon, Gael, it's Roberto!

108
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,541
Wait, Roberto?

[GAEL]
You simpering dunce!

110
00:07:56,583 --> 00:08:00,166
How do you mistake a Makai
Knight for a Horror?

111
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,833
That's why after all this time,

112
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,791
no one at the Watchdog Center's
seen fit to knight you!

00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:05,791

Now, now!

[MARCELO grunts]

You get back here! I'm not
done scolding you yet!

116
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,250
[GAEL sighs]
A thousand pardons, Roberto.

117
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,625
Or perhaps I should call you
Germán now instead?

118
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,625
[GERMÁN laughs]
Either one, old friend.

119
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,500
I guess we're both having
trouble getting our successors

120
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,833
ready to fill our shoes, eh?

00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,583

[rain, thunder]

124

[GAEL] The hellish witch
hunts of Valiante thin our

[MARCELO cries]

128

Bloodied as we are, Roberto,
the day when Horrors

reign supreme cannot be far off.

[MARCELO cries]

132
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,666
Hush, Marcelo. Dry your eyes.

Tears are not becoming
of a knight.

134
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,375
[GERMÁN]
Master Gael.

135
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:18,583
[GAEL grunts]
This is the Mado Ring.

136
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,250
Yes, as heir to his bloodline,

137
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,208
Anna's father passed
it down to her.

138
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:26,000
Well, the demon sealed
within has long since

139
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,291
fled his broken prison cell.

140
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:33,041
Yes, but what is broken now
can be made whole again.

141
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:36,958
So the child is to inherit Garo?

142
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,583
Very well.

143
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,041
[GERMÁN]
Speaking of the boy...

144

Hm?

Flames, eh?

Whatever it may be, it doesn't
seem to torment León any.

00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,875
[GERMÁN]
I do so hope you're right.

148
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,541
[GAEL]
Mm.

149
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,916
It will take me a long time.

I'm in no hurry.

Though he'll be wielding
a sword soon enough.

152
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,541
I'll fix it. Though I think

153
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,708
it'll take whatever
years I have left to do so.

[MARCELO gasps]

155
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:21,708
And now, the time has come.
There's nothing to fear, my lad.

156
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:25,791
The flames shall be quelled.
The demon Zaruba will serve

00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:30,416
you in good stead, as befits he

I've met that alchemist woman.
I've seen her cords in action,

00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,750
More's the pity.

317
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,000
If only you'd attached
it to my clothing,

318
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,625
think of the fun
we could've had.

319
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:38,666
[EMA chuckles]

320
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,083
What was that about?

321
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,416
Don't tell me you didn't know.
She put a tracker on you!

322
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,458
[LEÓN]
Tracker?

323
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,250
[gasps] That woman!

324
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,708
[SOLDIER] The traitorous Prince
Alfonso has been spotted nearby!

325
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,875
It is your duty as a
subject of King Fernando

326
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,791
to report any
sightings immediately!

327
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,041
Harbor this man,
or aid in his escape,

328
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,166
and your life is forfeit!

329
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,000
[ALFONSO]
Father.

330
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,416
Mother.

331
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,708
[HORROR SOLDIER grunts]

332
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,000
[gasps]

333
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,125
Your true face is
known to me now.

334
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,541
You monsters serve Mendoza,

335
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,541
that he may steal
my father's kingdom!

336
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,458
[yells]

337
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:48,000
[HORROR SOLDIER growls]

338
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,958
Know you this, demon!

339
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:53,083
I won't let your kind
sully my country!

340
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:56,041
I defy you in the
name of Valiante!

341
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,000
[HORROR SOLDIER grunts]

342
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,916
[ALFONSO groans, coughs]

343
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:21,750
[gasps]

344
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,250
[GARM] Horrors feed off the
darkness within human hearts.

345
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:09,500
No one born is immune
to such shadows.

346
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,958
That is why the enemy endures.
