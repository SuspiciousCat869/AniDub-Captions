1
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:29,000
Master.

2
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,666
[LEÓN]
Alfonso?

3
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,916
Let me help you
build a grave marker.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,416
Thank you, but I'll
wield this blade

5
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,291
and don his armor in
tribute to his legacy.

6
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,875
His memory defends me,

7
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:43,500
as this sword does, and every
day I shall honor him with it.

8
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,458
As you honor the
blood of your mother

9
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:49,291
with the sword you bear, León.

10
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,708
Huh? You knew?

11
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:54,458
You knew the
whole time, didn't you?

12
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,541
[ALFONSO]
You are the Golden Knight, Garo.

13
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,916
A title of legend.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,958
You are a myth, a hero
spoken of in countless stories.

15
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:06,458
All those that live beneath
Valiante's skies know the name.

16
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:09,666
[LEÓN sighs]
Such titles are only words.

17
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,208
I'm simply a Makai Knight

18
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:14,625
with aims to slay
Mendoza and his Horrors.

19
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:18,708
Yes, and that
is all that I am.

20
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,375
True or not,

21
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:24,000
you and I are both striving
toward the same goal.

22
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,666
Upon my sword I vow:

23
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,291
We will rid our fair
country of Mendoza.

24
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:31,458
Valiante will be free again.

25
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,958
Come! Let us so swear.

26
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,333
Huh?

27
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,958
[sighs] Right!

28
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,583
[EMA] You do so love
to put yourself in danger.

29
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,291
It actually pains me.

30
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,458
[LEÓN]
Ema!

31
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,083
Doing well, León?

32
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,458
What the hell?

33
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,083
Really? Is that how
you choose to address

34
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,750
the person who
just saved your life?

35
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:01,458
Thank you. I'm...
I'm in your debt.

36
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,333
Next time, why don't
you try looking me

37
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,375
in the eyes when
you say that, chico?

38
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,333
Now, thank me proper.

39
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:12,625
[grunts] I owe you my life!
Now get your hands off me!

40
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,041
That'll do. So...

41
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:18,833
Why would you risk life and limb
just to come back to this place?

42
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:22,333
I doubt you're here for
that naked fool of a father.

43
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,708
[LEÓN]
Hey, you in there?

44
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:28,666
You're back!

45
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,333
I found the supplies
we'll require

46
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,750
and something to eat, too.

47
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,000
[ALFONSO]
Thank you, León.

48
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,500
It's good to see you safe.

49
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,916
[LEÓN]
Safe is not how I'd put it.

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,333
You see--

51
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,333
[ALFONSO] Tell me, did you
happen to find your father

52
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:40,666
in the city as well?

53
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,833
I am quite anxious to
know that he's all right.

54
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,083
[gasps]

55
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,291
That idiot doesn't
deserve the name "father."

56
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,250
[ALFONSO] Come, I won't
have you speaking ill of the man

57
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,416
who's technically my uncle--
Who goes there?!

58
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,083
A simple Makai Alchemist
by the name of Ema Guzman.

59
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,083
It's such a pleasure
to finally meet you, Sire.

60
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,750
An alchemist?

61
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,250
You too fight for the freedom of
this land? I beg your pardon.

62
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,708
You are ever welcome here.

63
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,458
[EMA] Worry not,
Alfonso, pardon granted.

64
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,000
Now then.

65
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,708
I believe you said Germán is
your uncle, if I'm not mistaken.

66
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,708
He's an empty cask of a man,
ever beholden to his rudder,

67
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,500
so if it's true,
you have my condolences.

68
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,125
--[LEÓN sighs]
--[ALFONSO] Uh... Thank you?

69
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,333
[CUCKOLDED HUSBAND A]
Hold it right there,

70
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,000
you accursed weasel!

71
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,458
[GERMÁN] Wait! Just wait!
I can explain, I swear!

72
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,916
I was just helping your wife
with her stiff shoulders.

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,333
It's a serious problem!

74
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,500
[CUCKOLDED HUSBAND A]
That doesn't do a damned thing

75
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,000
to explain your own stiffness.

76
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,833
[GERMÁN chuckles]
Well, no, maybe not!

77
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,416
Ah! Look over there,
a witch soaring past!

78
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,458
She's naked as a jaybird!

79
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,625
[CUCKOLDED HUSBAND A]
Where?

80
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:40,000
Dammit! Where'd
that snake run off to?

81
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,833
What kind of woman would
marry a man like that?

82
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,916
Oh. Good morning, everyone.

83
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,541
The hell were you thinking?

84
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,958
[GERMÁN]
Hmmm...

85
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,625
Stay your hand, León.
This rake IS your father.

86
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,208
If that can even be possible.

87
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,666
Sad but true, young prince.

88
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,208
Who are you, exactly?

89
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,166
Oh. Right.

90
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,000
Please, call me Alfonso.

91
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:04,500
I'm a Makai Knight, descended
of Garo, like your son, here.

92
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:08,583
Huh...? "Descended
of Garo." But how?!

93
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:13,583
It can't be! Impossible!
Still, you do have her eyes.

94
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:14,125
Hey!

95
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,375
Could it be?

96
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,500
Could my sweet Anna have
loved another in secret?

97
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,000
Tell me, quickly, what kind
of man was your father?

98
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:21,833
[ALFONSO]
Uh...

99
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,250
No, speak not another word!

100
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,750
Will you stop spouting
nonsense for one second?

101
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,333
[GERMÁN]
No matter.

102
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:31,833
You are a son of my beloved Anna
and I will raise you as my own.

103
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:32,958
[LEÓN]
What?

104
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,208
[GERMÁN]
I must be alone.

105
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,333
There is much to think on.

106
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,500
[EMA laughs]

107
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,291
Who'd have thought the
consummate home-wrecker

108
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,875
had such a glass jaw?

109
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,500
This is all a misunderstanding.
We must put his mind to rest.

110
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,750
Let him stew a bit.

111
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,000
[ALFONSO] But--

112
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,416
She's right, though it's
hardly punishment enough

113
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,125
for all the crap he's pulled.

114
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:53,166
How can he doubt Mother when
he finds a new bed every night?

115
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,291
He loves her so much that
it's impossible to trust her.

116
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,458
[chuckles] He's almost
cute all flustered.

117
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,791
[GERMÁN]
My Anna.

118
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,541
How could you keep
another love from me?

119
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:10,625
Was I not man enough?
[sobs]

120
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,541
Santa Bard's Royal
Palace is built

121
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,500
upon the ruins of an old temple.

122
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,791
There should still be an
entrance tucked away

123
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,791
somewhere near the
base of the eastern cliff.

124
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,208
Through the temple,
there's a tunnel,

125
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,208
which connects to
the bowels of the castle.

126
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,083
It once served as
a royal escape route,

127
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,291
and with any luck,
it's still undefended.

128
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,041
[EMA] Maybe,
but Mendoza is certainly

129
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,291
aware of its existence.

130
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,583
[ALFONSO] Yes, perhaps,
but it's far less risky

131
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,958
than attacking
head on. However...

132
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,541
What?

133
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,833
Surely the castle is filled to
the brim with Mendoza's Horrors.

134
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,000
We have no way of
knowing what awaits us.

135
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,500
[EMA] Nothing good.

136
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,458
He controls the Horrors by use
of a forbidden Madou tool,

137
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,625
Zirkiel's Circle.
He stole it from the council.

138
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,833
It functions like the rings you
wear but on a grander scale.

139
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,416
[BERNARDO] The Orvien
Chimera has been slain

140
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,125
at the hand of our
little prince Alfonso.

141
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:08,291
Another soul to the ranks
of the Makai Knighthood.

142
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,916
[MENDOZA sighs]

143
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,291
[MENDOZA] I put one down
and yet another rises.

144
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,958
Such curs are naught
but mindless dogs,

145
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,208
good only for hunting
and birthing more.

146
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:26,208
Though, Rafael's death
comes as welcome news to me.

147
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,208
I am glad of your victory.

148
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,833
I pity the ground stained
by his filthy Makai blood.

149
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,916
Death has taken all those
who stood in judgment.

150
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,791
[YOUNGER MENDOZA]
Excommunication?

151
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:40,208
For serving our order,
you would see me exiled from it?

152
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,291
I have created a miracle!

153
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,958
A Madou tool of
infinite potential!

154
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:48,208
You saw my results,
you saw what it can do!

155
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,958
[MASTER]
Silence, do not speak.

156
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,208
That which you call
a miracle, Mendoza,

157
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,750
is but defilement and betrayal.

158
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:58,458
Your vile use of human blood
breaks our most sacred pact,

159
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,583
for we are sworn
above all things to guard

160
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,625
and keep mortal life.

161
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,958
Our pact is so
ancient it crumbles!

162
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:07,625
We are more than humanity could
ever dare dream of becoming!

163
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,250
Why should we
kneel at their feet?

164
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,083
Why should we serve?!

165
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,291
Let us rule over them

166
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,875
and see their precious
freedom brought low!

167
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,333
They should beg and scrape

168
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:20,458
for the privilege of
bleeding at our hands!

169
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,958
How I pity you, Mendoza.

170
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,625
You are blind to
your sins, even now.

171
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:32,750
Were we not fettered by our
oath, you would meet your end.

172
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,291
However, we may brand you

173
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,833
as chastisement
for your corruption.

174
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:39,958
But Master!

175
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,625
My tool can do more
than you've seen!

176
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,750
It can grant you eternal life!

177
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,250
You are long lost, alchemist.

178
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,916
It is in the birth of new life
that mankind achieves eternity.

179
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,291
[MENDOZA]
You fool!

180
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,708
[MASTER] We purge our
order of your tainted blood.

181
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,291
Never again will
it cross our own.

182
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:00,041
Written in thy veins
shall be this mark.

183
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:03,875
Seared upon thy children
and thy children's children.

184
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:08,125
Eternally shall they inherit
the punishment for your sin.

185
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,291
[MENDOZA]
Why, master?

186
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:32,791
Why have you forsaken me? Why?

187
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,375
[YOUNGER MENDOZA]
Damn you!

188
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:50,333
I will see you suffer
for every mark on my skin!

189
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,541
Your name is Mendoza?

190
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,875
I understand you're
the one whose medicines

191
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,708
saved my fair city from
the ravages of the plague.

192
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:03,708
Many thanks.

193
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,708
Yes, Your Majesty.

194
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,791
[FERNANDO]
You are a wanderer, yes? A sage?

195
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,208
It would give me great pleasure
to have you stay a while.

196
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:14,125
Why don't you enter my
service here at the castle?

197
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,875
I will serve with
pride, Highness.

198
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,291
[FERNANDO]
Mendoza! Hahaha!

199
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,541
Ah, good to see you, my friend!
I bring happy news!

200
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,083
Haha! Your strategy
was a great success!

201
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,750
The battle's won! I owe this
conquest to your advice!

202
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,750
I live to serve, my liege.

203
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,458
Your wisdom is unparalleled--

204
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,541
you must have been
blessed with divine insight

205
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,125
to know that their army
would fall to our assault.

206
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:41,333
Blessed with the might
of Horrors, my good lord.

207
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,041
Huh?

208
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:42,666
[MENDOZA]
Nothing.

209
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,083
Well, 'tis fine!

210
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,750
Just see to it that
you keep my rewards

211
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,791
as close as you keep
your many secrets.

212
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,375
M'lady, please join us inside!

213
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,416
[gasps]

214
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,958
Meet your wife.

215
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,416
This young maid is
Angelina--eldest daughter

216
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,583
of my esteemed bannerman,
the Count of Gostilia.

217
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,375
I confess it a part of my plot

218
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:08,666
to keep you ever at my side,
Mendoza! Hahahaha!

219
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,625
[woman screaming]

220
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,750
[MIDWIFE A]
Huh? No. Please, sir.

221
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,791
You mustn't come closer. Ah!

222
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:24,000
[sobs]

223
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,750
[MASTER] We purge our
order of your tainted blood.

224
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,416
Never again will
it cross our own.

225
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,125
Written in thy veins
shall be this mark.

226
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:36,041
Seared upon thy children
and thy children's children.

227
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,083
Amor.

228
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,916
Accursed Makai...
Knights, Alchemists...

229
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,166
I shall sever clean
your bloodlines

230
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,125
from this earth
'til not one remains!

231
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,875
Who approaches?

232
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,291
You're the handmaid
to Her Highness.

233
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,416
[OCTAVIA] My name
is Octavia, good lord.

234
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,791
[MENDOZA]
Why do you come to me?

235
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,583
I was raised to
believe in God,

236
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,541
a Master I have
never laid eyes on,

237
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,083
but each day I have seen
demons that bring suffering,

238
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,083
with no intervention
from Heaven.

239
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,291
But your coldness,
your strength,

240
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,916
this is a power
I can believe in.

241
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,375
The Horrors, then.
You saw them, girl?

242
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,916
[gasps] Is that the
title you gave them?

243
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,291
Your God's betrayal
still lingers within you.

244
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,708
Do you forsake all other oaths,
and swear fealty to me?

245
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:58,958
[OCTAVIA]
Yes.

246
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,958
I am yours within and
without, I do so swear.

247
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,625
[MENDOZA]
Octavia.

248
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,416
Listen well to my words.

249
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,750
I shall never forsake you,
nor ever discard you.

250
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:13,083
Your God, in His
arrogance, already has.

251
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:20,125
But you are not permitted to
ever lay your hand upon me.

252
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,333
[MENDOZA]
Bernardo. I have faith

253
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:29,166
that your knights will locate
the traitorous prince soon.

254
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,958
Ensure it is done
with no mistakes.

255
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,708
Maybe the boy will give
me a fight worth my time.

256
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,916
Not yet.

257
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,083
Choose well the place
you'll cut him down.

258
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,041
Hmph.

259
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,666
[MENDOZA]
Come along.

260
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,250
We have much to prepare
for the hero's return.

261
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,833
[GERMÁN sighs]
Oh, Anna.

262
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:10,208
Was our perfect
love just a façade?

263
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,833
And what then of León?

264
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:15,000
Did he inherit your
hidden hatred for me?

265
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:19,041
Oh! Whoa! Ahh...

266
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,125
[sighs]

267
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,041
Hey! What was that for?

268
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,166
Just shocking you
out of your depression.

269
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,333
Let's go.

270
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,458
But you very nearly
killed me! [growls]

271
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,375
[ALFONSO chuckles]

272
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,916
Eh... Where're we off to?

273
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,583
[LEÓN] A secret passage
into the castle.

274
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,458
If you are not opposed,
I'll lead the way.

275
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,125
I believe you said
your name was Alfonso.

276
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,333
[ALFONSO]
Sir.

277
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,000
First, I apologize.

278
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,958
This time alone helped me to
put order to my manly thinking.

279
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,000
Uh?

280
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,500
[GERMÁN]
You're still Anna's blood,

281
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,666
no matter the father, and
I will raise you like my own.

282
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,500
We've got a lot of lost
time to make up for, son.

283
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,500
Thank you, but, I, uh...

284
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,541
[LEÓN]
Seriously?

285
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,125
What kind of idiot are you?

286
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,375
We don't share the
same mother, you moron!

287
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,916
[GERMÁN]
Wha?

288
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,291
[GERMÁN laughs]
Of course! I get it!

289
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,500
Of course she
had a little sister!

290
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,625
I knew all along Anna would
never have betrayed me!

291
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,291
How did this never come up?

292
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,916
She was probably so lost
in my eyes, she just forgot.

293
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,416
Hey, hold on
just a minute there.

294
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,541
That would make me the
uncle to the heir apparent

295
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,833
of Valiante's throne which,
in turn, would make me

296
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,666
almost a part of
the royal bloodline!

297
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,333
Now! Let us strike fast and
capture Santa Bard Castle!

298
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,083
As uncle to Valiante's
beloved prince-in-exile,

299
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,666
I'll have my royal hands
full of all the handmaidens!

300
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,125
Maybe a harem!

301
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:38,958
[GERMÁN screams]

302
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,166
How'd he make
it down so fast?

303
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,041
We should catch up.

304
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,958
Here. And up you go.

305
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,250
You're a great help.

306
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,375
[GERMÁN sneezes]

307
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,583
We'll begin scouting
at the top, Uncle.

308
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,833
Yeah, I'm right behind ya.
Just give me a minute.

309
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,583
Germán, do you think
that boy can handle it?

310
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:06,875
Hmm? Well, he's faced much
since this mad quest began.

311
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:10,250
It's nice to see that you're
worried about León, though.

312
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,250
There's danger in
those marks on his skin.

313
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,541
Over time, he may succumb.

314
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,666
Oh? So you noticed that?

315
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,250
I notice much.

316
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,750
They respond aggressively when
his passions run the hottest.

317
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,500
The flames protect him,

318
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:28,291
yet that same inferno
could burn him to cinders.

319
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,875
I've no doubt the fire's
a trait of his mother.

320
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,583
All the rest is a mystery,
save that it's dangerous

321
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,541
and we can't do a
damn thing about it.

322
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:38,625
[LEÓN] Come on!
We don't have all day!

323
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,708
Wait. Are you not
along for the ride?

324
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,375
My role in this siege
has already been played.

325
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,166
Besides, I know
the thing I'm hunting

326
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,708
won't be found in Santa Bard.

327
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,625
Hunting, you say?

328
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,583
I've a Horror in mind.

329
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:56,041
Look who's got a mysterious
back-story ferretted away.

330
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,250
I should've known.

331
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,166
My apologies.

332
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,875
I'll leave charging into
certain death up to you, sir.

333
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:05,750
Certain death always
sounded kinda romantic to me.

334
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:10,125
Hey, if I do make it outta here,
why don't we have a drink?

335
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,916
With that sentiment, you won't.

336
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,083
So you know,

337
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,458
I'm gonna go ahead
and count that as a yes!

338
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,833
Only if I'm up for it.

339
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,166
Ah...

340
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:37,041
I never thought I'd
come home this way.

341
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,541
What of your mother?

342
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,041
If she's being held captive
inside the castle somewhere,

343
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,208
do you know where she'd be?

344
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,458
Yes.

345
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,625
They'd have moved her
to the Prisoner's Tower.

346
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:50,208
There's only one entrance,
and the bridge is always held.

347
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,833
[LEÓN] Right.
We make for the bridge.

348
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,250
We cannot.

349
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,708
I want my mother freed,
but I returned to save Valiante.

350
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:57,708
Huh?

351
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,500
[ALFONSO]
My land must come first.

352
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,208
My mother would say the
same thing in my place.

353
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,083
Even while imprisoned.

354
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,666
It is the truth.

355
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,416
This is the way of kings.
But I am grateful.

356
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,083
[SOLDIER 10A]
Well. Any change?

357
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:32,875
[SOLDIER 10B] None. She's still
quiet as the grave. [yawns]]

358
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,125
[SOLDIER 10A]
We must be vigilant.

359
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,750
Rumor is Prince Alfonso
has appeared in town.

360
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,083
[SOLDIER 10B]
He came back?

361
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,083
[SOLDIER 10A] Should he
come to rescue the Queen,

362
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,083
we won't survive the day.

363
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,416
Mendoza wants her ready to move

364
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,000
in case she must be
used to trump the prince.

365
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,166
[SOLDIER 10B]
Damn.

366
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,833
Of all the days to
get stuck guarding her.

367
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,625
[ESMERALDA]
My son.

368
00:19:53,708 --> 00:20:00,041
For Valiante's future, you must
see through the devil's traps.

369
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,500
This I pray!

370
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:14,041
[LEÓN] What are those?
There must be dozens of them.

371
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:18,000
They are certainly not ancient
enough to be part of the temple.

372
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,541
Which means all of this,

373
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,541
everything, has fallen
under Mendoza's spell.

374
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,125
[ALFONSO]
The Royal Tomb.

375
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:30,333
This is where the temple
and the palace become one.

376
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:34,000
Well this is a suitably creepy
foundation for the castle above.

377
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,708
I'm not sure I could sleep at
night knowing this was here.

378
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,083
[LEÓN]
Hmm?

379
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,666
What was that sound just now?

380
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,083
[ALFONSO]
I've never seen this place.

381
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,708
[LEÓN]
That smell is like rotted meat!

382
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:03,000
What the hell has Mendoza
been up to, hiding down here?

383
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,333
Nothing pleasant,
I can assure you.

384
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,125
We should keep moving.

385
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,625
[LEÓN]
Damn!

386
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,333
Come on, we keep
heading for the top!

387
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,750
[GERMÁN]
Right.

388
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,666
[LEÓN]
Horrors!

389
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:37,625
[ALFONSO]
Uncle!

390
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:38,375
[LEÓN]
Come on!

391
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,083
[ALFONSO]
Hurry!

392
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:47,333
[GERMÁN]
Get back in there now!

393
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,250
Now, on to find Mendoza.

394
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,791
[GERMÁN]
Damn.

395
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:05,291
And here I thought
this was going to be easy.

396
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,250
[gasps]

397
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:14,791
Good to see you again, Roberto.

398
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,000
What fun.

399
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,875
I guess neither one
of us is the same man

400
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,208
we were when
last we spoke, friend.

401
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:24,166
You have opted to
become a lunatic's hound.

402
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,250
[BERNARDO]
Very witty.

403
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:31,875
Finally, I can test
those blades of yours!

404
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,958
[GARM] They made
an oath long ago.

405
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:07,458
They smiled
in days past.

406
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:11,916
All that remains now
is dust and memory.
