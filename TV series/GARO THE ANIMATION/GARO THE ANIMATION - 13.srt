1
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,333
[LARA sneezes]

2
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,500
[LARA]
Where're you going?

3
00:01:58,583 --> 00:01:59,875
[LARA'S DOG barking]

4
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,583
[LARA] What's the
matter, silly? D'you--?

5
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:02,875
[gasps]

6
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:45,958
My dear mother, I vow,
from this day forward,

7
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,208
that the Knight of Light shall
be a champion of the people.

8
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,875
[ALFONSO]
Our tragedies are beyond count!

9
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,708
We have lost our families!

10
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,375
We have lost our friends!

11
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:05,083
Evils multiply!
Darkness prevails!

12
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,833
But I make this pledge
to you here and now!

13
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,041
Valiante will again
see the light!

14
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,083
[VILLAGERS]
Salve! Salve, Valiante!

15
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:18,000
Salve! Salve, Prince Alfonso!

16
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,958
[MAN A] My understanding is this
chaos was the work of demons.

17
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,416
Even the death of Her Majesty.

18
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,666
[MAN B] Word has it, Prime
Minister Mendoza made a pact

19
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,208
with one of those
vile creatures.

20
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,208
[MAN C]
Dark days indeed.

21
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,791
Is there any truth in what they
say of the Black Knighthood?

22
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,666
Yes, but at least
the worst is over.

23
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,041
The prince himself drove
the infernal horde back

24
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,166
from whence they came.

25
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,958
Wow! He must be really strong!

26
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,333
[MAN E]
Very much so.

27
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,666
Robust enough that even
now, after all his travails,

28
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,083
he happily stewards the country

29
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,333
in place of his infirm
father, the king.

30
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,750
[OLD WOMAN A] Thank heavens
for the flaxen-haired lad.

31
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,583
With Prince Alfonso
looking after us,

32
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,208
the people can at
last rest easy.

33
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,500
[XIMENA] Seems that tales of
His Highness's brave deeds

34
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,000
live on every tongue.

35
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,500
Charcoal renderings of his
face are a hot commodity

36
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,666
in the city plazas.

37
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,708
Artists are making
money hand over fist.

38
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:18,333
It's nice to see the people
get their zest back, I suppose.

39
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,916
Well, it does us no good
to be downtrodden forever.

40
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,541
An excellent point.

41
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,833
[XIMENA] Why don't I bring
you something to eat.

42
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,375
Aren't you at all curious?

43
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,791
Y'know, about how
I came to be wounded?

44
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,625
For all you can say, I owe
my condition to the prince.

45
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,666
Perhaps you're harboring
an evil guest.

46
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,250
[XIMENA chuckles]

47
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,041
Perhaps, but there again: I am a
woman who counts her blessings

48
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,583
and you did at least
have clothes on this time.

49
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,083
One can hardly call
them clothes any longer.

50
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,416
You might've said as much

51
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,041
before I went to the trouble
of laundering them.

52
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,416
May I use them as rags then?

53
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,083
[GERMÁN]
You may not! I need them!

54
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,875
They're the only clothes
I have in this world!

55
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,000
[XIMENA]
There you have it.

56
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,208
[sighs]

57
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,416
I don't know what
it is about her,

58
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,875
but that woman throws me off.

59
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,125
[GERMÁN]
Valiante's in good hands now.

60
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,791
What's left of it.

61
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,333
[GERMÁN]
Where have you gone, son?

62
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,166
[GARM]
All apologies.

63
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,375
I have no information
at the moment.

64
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,166
As far as can be ascertained,
he may be sitting on a cloud

65
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,916
or fathoms deep beneath
the farthest sea.

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,250
We're doing what we can, but
personnel is sorely lacking.

67
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,791
So hard to find good help.

68
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,625
[EMA]
No excuses necessary.

69
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37,208
I wasn't expecting
much from you lot.

70
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:40,375
[GARM] Will you continue
your own search?

71
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,750
Of course.

72
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,291
[GARM]
Then may your quest bear fruit.

73
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,166
[LARA]
I'm back!

74
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,958
[GRANDMA]
Welcome home, Lara.

75
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,375
[LARA]
Where's mama?

76
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,375
[GRANDMA] At the gathering
of the Village Chief.

77
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,875
She shouldn't be very much
longer, I don't think.

78
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:12,875
[LARA] And how are we
feeling today, Traveler?

79
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,500
We should wash your wounds.

80
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,791
It may not be
this warm tomorrow.

81
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,833
Why did you bother
to save me?

82
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:27,166
Oh, dear. So you
can talk after all.

83
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,458
Abuela! The traveler
isn't actually a mute!

84
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,375
Well, that's quite a turn.

85
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,375
My, my, words are handy.
Good to know you can use 'em.

86
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,125
We were sure whatever
brought you to this pass

87
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,083
must've also struck you dumb.

88
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,375
Help yourself.

89
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,375
Or, maybe, I should
feed it to you?

90
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,291
[LEÓN]
Why did you save me?

91
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,458
[LEÓN]
You should've let me alone.

92
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,416
I'd be better off dead.

93
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,375
If you died on our
land, young man,

94
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,375
we'd be responsible for
giving you a proper burial.

95
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,166
We're just three women
and one decrepit old sod.

96
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,250
Backbreaking work
isn't our forte.

97
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,875
If you're better off dead,
by all means die,

98
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,083
but at least dig
your own grave first.

99
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,083
He won't even have the strength
to do that if he doesn't eat.

100
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,583
I see our fare's
not to his liking.

101
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,000
Well, I'll gladly
eat his portion!

102
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,916
[chuckles]

103
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,791
[LARA]
Um...

104
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,833
If you need help, just say so.

105
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,375
[LEÓN]
I'm fine.

106
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,333
Right. I'll be back by evening.

107
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,625
[GRANDMA]
Ah, farewell.

108
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,583
Give our regards to
his lordship, my dear.

109
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,583
[LARA]
Traveler?

110
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,333
Abuela would like to air
out the sheets today

111
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,083
if that's okay with you.

112
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,291
[LARA] His lordship's house
is just there on the horizon.

113
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,416
Mama goes every day to help
the staff with odds and ends.

114
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,333
And there's the acorn forest.

115
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,875
See? Every household with a pig

116
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,125
is allowed to let them
roam there to fatten up.

117
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,416
You should see
what one looks like

118
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,250
when you've let it eat its fill.

119
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,500
We had a pig of our own
back when Papa was alive.

120
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,875
That was few years
ago now, though.

121
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:43,666
[LARA]
You all right?

122
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,833
[LEÓN]
Uh?

123
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,208
[LARA]
We can rest if you want.

124
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,000
[LEÓN grunts]

125
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,333
[LEÓN]
No...

126
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,250
[LARA]
The thing about onions

127
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,833
is they get sweeter once they've
made it through the winter.

128
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:12,125
[LEÓN]
Why am I still alive?

129
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,458
Why?

130
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,250
[LARA]
Here.

131
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:21,958
[LARA]
Sorry.

132
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,750
It's not much,
but it's all we have.

133
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,750
Tastes kinda like dirt.

134
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,083
It's fine.

135
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,250
Yeah, told you so.

136
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,708
I bet the food they have in
other places is a lot better.

137
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,916
I envy travelers, all the
tasty things they get to try.

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,458
You're lucky.

139
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,833
Hey, today's Thursday!

140
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,541
Mama always comes back
from his lordship's

141
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,041
with a basket of
fish on Thursdays,

142
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,416
so tonight's supper'll be
something to look forward to.

143
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,041
It's pretty good.
I think you'll like it.

144
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,958
[LARA]
Owww.

145
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,958
[LARA] We had more
when Papa was around.

146
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,125
Not much, but more
than we do now.

147
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,125
We kept chickens, pigs...

148
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,625
Oh! And he was an
excellent hunter, too.

149
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:15,708
One time, he brought home a deer
this big! Lasted us weeks!

150
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,458
[LARA giggles]

151
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,375
I miss Papa.

152
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,958
Three years ago he was
out hunting in the woods...

153
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,208
Wild animals attacked and killed
him. It was a pack of wolves.

154
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,125
Was it... possibly a Horror?

155
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,500
[LARA]
It was pretty horrible...

156
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,666
[LEÓN]
No, that's... I'm sorry.

157
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,291
[LARA]
We're back!

158
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,458
[GRANDMA]
Welcome home.

159
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,500
[LARA] You'll never guess
what happened, Abuela.

160
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,916
On the way home,

161
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,791
there was this big animal
that came out of the brush

162
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,875
and ran across our
path; scared me...

163
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,166
[LEÓN]
Compared to where I come from,

164
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,958
this is a very different world.

165
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,583
[LARA] ...I told him about the
fat pigs in the acorn forest,

166
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,166
and where his lordship lives.

167
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,041
We're both looking forward
to fish for supper!

168
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,333
[HORROR A roars]

169
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:17,625
[HORROR A roaring]

170
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:18,833
[ALFONSO grunts]

171
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,916
[HORROR A roars]

172
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,500
[HORROR B growling]

173
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,583
[ALFONSO grunts]

174
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,041
I am in your debt,
good uncle. Many thanks.

175
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,958
Bravo. Excellent work.

176
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:07,250
By day, you toil to restore
the kingdom's former glory.

177
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,875
By night, you hunt down
the Horrors that remain.

178
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,250
'Tis the sacred duty of
those who inherit this armor

179
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,666
and I take it very seriously.

180
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,375
May I assume that you
are fully recovered

181
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,666
from your injuries, sir?

182
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,208
[GERMÁN]
More or less.

183
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,250
Honestly, I'm just sick and
tired of lying in bed all day.

184
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,166
High time I resumed hunting
nocturnal butterflies.

185
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, forgive me.

186
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:31,000
I... didn't realize there were
butterflies of that variety.

187
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,791
[GERMÁN]
Uh, what I mean by that...

188
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:37,291
...is perhaps I should choose
my euphemisms more carefully.

189
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,000
And what of... him?

190
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:43,833
León do you know what
came of him, by chance?

191
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,708
I don't.

192
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,541
Whether he stands or falls,

193
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:52,083
it's his decision to
make... no one else's.

194
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:55,458
He's beyond all help,
save his own.

195
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,208
[GERMÁN]
Guilt is a useless emotion.

196
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,791
Garo chose you.

197
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,333
I suggest you
take pride in that.

198
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,708
[ALFONSO]
Yes.

199
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,875
[LARA]
Here. Safe travels.

200
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,083
[MOTHER]
Thank you, darling.

201
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,500
Now remember,

202
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,583
I'm counting on you to handle
the rest of the onions.

203
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,791
I oughta finish planting
them by dusk.

204
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,541
[GRANDMA]
Lara.

205
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,958
Be a dear and fetch the pajamas
off that worthless so and so,

206
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,208
would you?

207
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,500
[LARA]
Good morning, Traveler!

208
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,250
[laughing]

209
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,000
[LARA]
Sorry about this.

210
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,083
[LARA laughs]

211
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,416
[LARA]
Abuela's doing laundry.

212
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,791
[LEÓN]
I can undress myself, thank you.

213
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:11,833
After we're done
with the onions,

214
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,375
our next task is
collecting plenty of wood.

215
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,833
Abuelo says, from
the look of things,

216
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,666
winter'll come a
little early this year.

217
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,291
Mind if I ask where you're
headed after you leave us?

218
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,333
If I were you, I'd go
somewhere nice and warm.

219
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,541
[LEÓN]
Do you ever get sick of this?

220
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,875
[LARA]
Huh?

221
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,500
Following the same routine
every day of your life.

222
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,125
Don't you ever feel like
walking away from it?

223
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:38,875
Just giving up on making
this work and... moving on?

224
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,458
Did you give something
up to become a traveller?

225
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,583
Uh.

226
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,125
[LARA]
I mean,

227
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,291
there's probably a whole lot
of wonderful places out there,

228
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,708
other lands, other climates,
other ways of living.

229
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,291
But I could never
walk away from this.

230
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,500
Papa left us this land.

231
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,375
It's his legacy.

232
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,916
Look there, I planted
every seed myself.

233
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,083
Autumn, wheat, and rye.

234
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,916
Come spring, we'll
start to see sprouts.

235
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,916
By summer, they'll be
mature enough to harvest,

236
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,708
and then all the hard work
will have been worth it.

237
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,125
And that field over there?
In spring, it'll be covered

238
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,666
with white chamomile
blossoms everywhere.

239
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,083
They'll spread all
the way to the horizon.

240
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,416
It'll be so pretty.

241
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,833
[MOTHER]
Last year's debts are heavy.

242
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,916
No question, we could've
done without the hail.

243
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,500
[GRANDPA] Only a fool
counts broken stalks of wheat.

244
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,833
I like that. Is that
one of your old sayings?

245
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,833
His lordship said
he was more than happy

246
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,958
to let us pay him back
at our convenience.

247
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,833
So, we've nothing
to worry about.

248
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,958
How you can be so nonchalant
I'll never understand, Mother.

249
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,750
I wish I had your spirit.

250
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,250
[GRANDMA]
At my age,

251
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,416
you've seen many a bad year
followed by a good harvest.

252
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,541
Then I'd say we're definitely
due for a windfall.

253
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,666
[GRANDPA]
The old woman sent you, did she?

254
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,125
[GRANDPA]
An irrigation canal.

255
00:17:56,208 --> 00:18:00,083
Nasty hailstorm destroyed
it some time ago.

256
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,041
Be my guest.

257
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,625
This old back could use a rest.

258
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:21,041
[grunting]

259
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,416
Strength alone isn't
the way to do it.

260
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,291
[gasps]

261
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,541
Looks like somebody's worn out.

262
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,041
[laughing]

263
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,833
[LARA]
It works!

264
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:53,083
Splendidly done. We can
breathe all the easier.

265
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:57,000
Oh my heavens. To see it fixed
before the first touch of ice.

266
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,208
Lad, your hard work made
all of this possible!

267
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,375
[LARA] Thank you, Traveler.
We're very grateful.

268
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,666
The name's León.

269
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,541
Huh?

270
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,666
I had never said.

271
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,541
Thought you should know.

272
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:20,916
Good work.

273
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,125
Something tells me
Abuela's right.

274
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:31,208
Next year's going to
be a good harvest.

275
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,833
[ALFONSO] The city's marketplace
reopened today, Your Majesty.

276
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:47,375
Merchants are coming back.
Meat is in ample supply.

277
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,291
Well, adequate supply.

278
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,083
Those in want can finally
be provided for at least.

279
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,250
[FERNANDO sighs]

280
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,458
[FERNANDO]
Forgive me, Alfonso,

281
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,416
that this terrible burden
should fall to you.

282
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,916
[ALFONSO]
Tis no burden.

283
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,333
Do not think it so. The worry
will hamper your recovery.

284
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,458
The people long to see their
king once again standing tall.

285
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:10,291
Do not deny them, Father.

286
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:13,708
Quite right. Thank you, son.

287
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,708
What His Majesty
needs now is rest.

288
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:22,083
Please, see that he's
attended to, constantly.

289
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,583
[OCTAVIA]
As you wish.

290
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,375
[GARM]
Comparison is all too human.

291
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:06,833
For even as things change,

292
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:09,375
they bear the mark of
their former selves.

293
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:12,250
Dreams become phantoms.
