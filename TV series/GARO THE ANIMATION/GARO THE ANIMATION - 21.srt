1
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:15,833
[LEÓN]
To protect even just one person.

2
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,458
That they might see another day.

3
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:21,458
For them, I will pay any
price you deem worthy.

4
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:25,458
[LEÓN]
Help me.

5
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,333
[EMA]
Mendoza's a gifted Alchemist.

6
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,500
It's possible he
crafted some illusion

7
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,458
whereby he only
appeared to have died.

8
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,375
Alas, I haven't yet searched
the subterranean temple.

9
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,708
[MENDOZA] Let the retinue
of fools occupy themselves

10
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,625
as the please, I am impervious.

11
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:40,875
[OCTAVIA]
Damn them to hell!

12
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:44,166
May the Makai Knights
burn for all eternity!

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,291
[GERMÁN] I'll thank
you all to leave it be.

14
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,416
Not that you'll listen.

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,833
[LEÓN]
Old man.

16
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:54,416
Out of our way,
or I'll cut you down.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,625
[chuckles] Quite the
look of determination

18
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,958
you've got there, son.

19
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:11,916
How could you?

20
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,458
Bastard. What the hell
would possess you

21
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:19,125
to protect the
likes of Mendoza?!

22
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,000
Tell me it's all a lie!

23
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:22,333
Uh...

24
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,791
[gasps]

25
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,875
Blame the Watchdog Center, Leon.

26
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,791
Que sera, we're knights.
A mission is a mission.

27
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:32,458
[gasps] I'm asking for your
personal reason, old man!

28
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:34,166
[GERMÁN chuckles]

29
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,708
Yeah. I know how
your mind works.

30
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:38,291
You'd have seen them
all rot in hell

31
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:41,208
before you accepted a mission
you didn't believe in.

32
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,291
At least the man
I know would have.

33
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,250
Perhaps you're mad,
or a doppelgänger.

34
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:48,958
Well said.

35
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,291
[gasps]

36
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,375
[GERMÁN] But if you wish
to get through to me,

37
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,208
you'll have to speak in steel.

38
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:58,458
Words be damned.
The deed is all.

39
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:01,458
A Makai Knight's
tongue is his blade.

40
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,208
[LEÓN grunts]

41
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,833
[GERMÁN]
Or is my son's so blunted

42
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:08,666
he can only hope to stammer?

43
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,166
Did your fall from grace
leave no impression?

44
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,291
Did the world welcome you?

45
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,833
Or can it be you're
still a willful upstart

46
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,500
with no sense of his duty?

47
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:18,958
[LEÓN growls]

48
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,416
[LEÓN, GERMÁN grunt]

49
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:06,541
[MENDOZA] I beheld last night's
misfortune with some interest.

50
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,250
You were, without reservation,

51
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,541
prepared to sacrifice life
and limb for your master.

52
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,875
Do not imagine I
shall forget that.

53
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,375
Please, sir.
It was merely my duty.

54
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,875
No more, and no less. As
undeserving of remark as can be.

55
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,083
[rumble]

56
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:26,291
Regardless, their search has
brought them to the chapel.

57
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,625
And for the time being
I am confined to bed.

58
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,750
I fear something might befall
you while I convalesce.

59
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,166
[MENDOZA]
Do not be troubled.

60
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,166
They will learn the
truth, only too late.

61
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,000
Our friend takes great
pride in his chivalry.

62
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,791
He intends to be my shield,
let him prove equal to it.

63
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,333
[OCTAVIA] Is he equal
to your trust, master?

64
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,125
My dear child.

65
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,583
'Tis no matter when one's
enemies are powerless.

66
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,833
[LEÓN, GERMÁN grunting]

67
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:02,666
[GERMÁN]
Hi-yah!

68
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,291
[LEÓN groaning, yells]

69
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,250
[GERMÁN groans]

70
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,041
[GERMÁN growls]

71
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,416
[LEÓN, GERMÁN grunting]

72
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,916
They're both so... serious.

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,666
By which I'm sure you
mean they're stupid.

74
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,458
[GERMÁN, LEÓN grunting]

75
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,166
[LEÓN]
This can be no one else.

76
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,416
But he's not in
thrall to some spell.

77
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,000
It's him! What's become
of my old man?!

78
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,125
[LEÓN, GERMÁN grunting]

79
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:02,750
[LEÓN] Answer me, damn
you! What's going on?!

80
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:03,583
[GERMÁN]
Heh.

81
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,833
[LEÓN]
Uh... Uh!

82
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,750
[GERMÁN grunts]

83
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,291
'S that all you got?

84
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,375
I wasn't expecting miracles,
but for the love of God, León.

85
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,208
That's enough, dammit!

86
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,708
I won't ask again,
you piece of shit!

87
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,500
Bit sensitive, huh?
That's adorable.

88
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,708
[GARM]
Stand down, Garo!

89
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,875
[LEÓN gasps]
Is that Garm?

90
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,583
[GARM]
Makai Knight Zoro is assigned

91
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,791
to the protection of Mendooza.

92
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:39,166
He has, in fact, pledged
his life to the task.

93
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,500
This is our consensus.

94
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,666
[GARM] The former Makai
Alchemist's twisted plot

95
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,875
has at last come to light.

96
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:51,041
Where advantage presents
itself, we must take it.

97
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,166
Particularly where it concerns
the slaying of Horrors

98
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,750
on an unprecedented scale.

99
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,625
[GARM]
Tonight is the lunar eclipse.

100
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,000
When the moon is
awash in darkness.

101
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:06,291
A demon of incomprehensible
size will awaken from its

102
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,833
ages-long slumber
beneath Valiante.

103
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:13,666
Mendooza, you see, has
already released its seal.

104
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,375
The black moon shall rise to its
highest point in the firmament.

105
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,208
And the Gates of Makai
will yawn asunder,

106
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,541
spilling a vile company
into this world.

107
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,416
The throng of Horrors
will be beyond count.

108
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,000
They will break in wave
upon infernal wave.

109
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,375
Many souls are likely to perish.

110
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:37,291
This night begins Hell on Earth
such as we've never seen.

111
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,541
In short, a golden opportunity.

112
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,958
[gasps]

113
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,041
What?

114
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,625
What are you talking about?

115
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,041
We're just going
to let this happen?!

116
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,750
[ALFONSO] You're using
an unthinkable threat

117
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,833
against Valiante as
a pretext to hunt?!

118
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,291
[EMA]
How is your threadbare company

119
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,916
of Knights and Alchemists
any match against a throng?

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,458
Yes, well, our strength
shall not in fact be key.

121
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,416
[XIMENA gasps]

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,416
[GARM] We anticipate a goodly
number to be dispatched

123
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,916
before our intervention
is required.

124
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Many will escape,
make no mistake.

125
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,666
They will gnaw away at the
world of man for all eternity.

126
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:36,458
Nonetheless, their ranks will
be significantly thinned.

127
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:41,166
For that, you would sacrifice
the people of Valiante?

128
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,791
[GARM] Stand down, Gaia.
The decision has been made.

129
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,250
[ALFONSO, EMA gasp]

130
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:58,333
Dammit. That Garm always takes
the best lines for herself.

131
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,875
[chuckles]

132
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:03,666
At any rate, that's how it is.
Mendoza's evil ambition and

133
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,708
a volley of Horrors will soon
be extinguished, end of story.

134
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,416
Foolish uncle.

135
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,750
You cannot consent to a plan
that would destroy this country!

136
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,250
Look, it's not a
pleasant thought,

137
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,125
and I appreciate the dilemma.

138
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,583
But, do you see any alternative?

139
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,791
This has been a losing battle
since time out of mind.

140
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,000
[gasps]

141
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,291
[GERMÁN] The Makai Knights
have dwindled to nothing.

142
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:33,250
Only so many lives can be
spared by what's left of us.

143
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:37,291
Now is our chance to tip the
balance. Drastically, yes.

144
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,875
At great cost, yes.

145
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,250
But such have always been
the terms. This is our lot.

146
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:46,208
These are the decisions duty
compels protectors to make.

147
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,666
Sacrificing so many
to save that many more?

148
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,958
Exactly the reason why I'm
asking you to back off.

149
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,541
We are sworn to
protect the world.

150
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:03,791
[gasps]

151
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,541
Yes. Yes, we are.

152
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,250
And yet somehow we're
expected to stand idly by

153
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,875
while innocent people
are slaughtered.

154
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,875
So many more can live.

155
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,708
I won't do it.
Those terms are unacceptable!

156
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,666
[LEÓN] I don this armor
to protect the powerless.

157
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,666
Every last innocent soul.

158
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,166
That is what it means

Of course we do. Even so,
we do not accept defeat.

told to suckling children.

it is futile.

318
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,333
It will awaken and engorge
itself on the Horrors pouring

319
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,958
through the Makai Gates.

320
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:39,666
And when its power
is bridled to my will,

321
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,250
the secret of immortality
will be mine.

322
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,041
[ALFONSO]
León! Are you all right?!

323
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,458
[ALFONSO, EMA gasp]

324
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,666
[LEÓN whimpers]

325
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,583
[LEÓN]
Old man...

326
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,416
[GARM]
The moon darkens.

327
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,041
Broken gears turn and grind.

328
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:11,083
The awful Day of
Judgment has come.
