[SHOPKEEPER 6A]
Ya got that right!

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,875
[GERMÁN] Do you mind if I
ask about the Knighthood?

160
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,208
I forgot!

161
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,208
That's what we were
talking about before!

162
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,458
It's old enough news
in these parts,

163
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,791
but the knight who'd been
heading up the King's army

164
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,291
lost his life in some
sort of accident.

165
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,958
The man's body wasn't even
cold when a new fellow

166
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,083
showed up to fill the vacancy.

167
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:36,958
[JORDI] Armor dark as the abyss.
Cut a dire figure, he did.

168
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,666
Folks took to calling
him the Black Knight.

169
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,375
[GERMÁN]
Naturally.

170
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,333
[JORDI]
He founded a new military order,

171
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,333
deep within the castle's walls.

172
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,166
They call themselves the
Brotherhood of the Black.

173
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,000
Between their fighting prowess
and their dark armor,

174
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,333
their foes are right
to be terrified.

175
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:56,416
They sound like a force
to be reckoned with.

176
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,375
Their numbers were low, so in
a move to fill their ranks,

177
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:03,083
they cast their nets far and
wide in the hunt for able men.

178
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,583
[GERMÁN]
Even the peasantry?

179
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,166
[JORDI]
Even us.

180
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,625
They took in hopefuls from
all over the kingdom,

181
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,083
money and birth be damned.

182
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,875
They said that if you passed
the real combat test

183
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,291
at the end, you could
even be knighted.

184
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,208
Hell of an incentive,
wouldn't you agree?

185
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:21,208
[GERMÁN] Hm. So they'd
fight to the death?

186
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:25,416
That they would, my friend.
I know better than most,

187
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,708
for I have got a personal
connection to it.

Sergi, my son.

191

Took everything
they threw at him,

192

and passed with flying colors.

193

Call it empty bragging,

194
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,041
but I'm proud as hell
of that boy.

195

Would've been easier
just to learn my craft

196
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,333
and live a simple life,
but he wanted to do

right by the kingdom.

00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,250
[JULIO]
Please, wait! Forgive him!

315
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,916
He didn't mean anything by it!

316
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,291
We were acting like
a pair of donkeys.

317
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,791
He was right to get angry.

318
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:23,666
[JULIO]
Mm...

319
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,541
What is it?

320
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,166
You can trust us, we're friends.

321
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,458
At the tavern.

322
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,125
Remember when the
Boss was telling you

323
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,250
about the knights at the castle?

324
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,291
Yes.

325
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,500
And he said his son
was among them.

326
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,583
[JULIO]
Big Brother Sergi isn't there.

327
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,083
Come again?

328
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,458
[JULIO] He didn't survive
the trial by combat.

329
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,458
[GERMÁN, LEÓN gasp]

330
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,875
They brought his
sword to the shop

331
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,958
so the Boss would have
something to remember him by.

332
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,458
Ever since that day,
he's been different.

333
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,333
He sent away the
other apprentices,

334
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,333
and the fire's gone dark.

335
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:56,291
When he looks at me,
it's like I'm a stranger!

336
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,375
I'm sure it sounds
foolish, but it's like

337
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,666
he's been possessed
by something!

338
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,458
I'm afraid all the time!

339
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,750
I keep thinking about it,
but I don't know what to do!

340
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:05,916
Please listen to me.

341
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,250
There's something
you need to hear.

342
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,041
Huh?

343
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,791
[door creaks]

344
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,833
No doubt about it.

345
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,458
There's a fiend on
the loose out there!

346
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,958
[SOLDIER 6D yelps]

347
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:30,458
[SOLDIER 6E screams]

348
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,166
I swear to God! Your son
is dead, all right?

349
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,166
He died right in front of me!

350
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,416
[HORROR JORDI]
He's not dead, but you are.

351
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,041
[whimpers]

352
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,375
[screams]

353
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,791
[HORROR JORDI]
Liars, every last one of you.

354
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:50,041
Give Sergi back to me.

355
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,000
[screams]

356
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:57,791
[JULIO] Please, Boss!
Sergi is gone, forever!

357
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,125
He's not coming back!

358
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,541
[HORROR JORDI]
Why would you lie to me, Julio?

359
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,500
After all I've done for you.

360
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,375
But it's true!

361
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,375
[GERMÁN]
León!

362
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,375
[GERMÁN]
Leave this one to a father.

363
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,875
[HORROR JORDI grunts]

364
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,750
[HORROR JORDI grunts]

365
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,041
[GERMÁN]
That's a new one.

366
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,208
[HORROR JORDI grunts, groans]

367
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,333
You know I would've broken
that little boy in half!

368
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,541
[BOTH gasp]

369
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,416
[BOTH yelp]

370
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,833
[HORROR JORDI grunting]

371
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,541
[GERMÁN yells]

372
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,500
[HORROR JORDI groans]

373
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,708
[GERMÁN yells]

374
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,791
[HORROR JORDI groans]

375
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,791
[GERMÁN grunts]

376
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:22,875
[HORROR JORDI groans]

377
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:41,958
Why'd he have to die?
He was a good man!

378
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,541
He saved me.

379
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:47,416
But when he needed saving,
I couldn't do anything for him!

380
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,833
I'm sorry, Boss!

381
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,708
[GERMÁN] You know, people are
pretty damn fragile, at heart.

382
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,583
Hit them in the wrong
spot, and it all comes

383
00:19:56,666 --> 00:20:00,333
tumbling down in a
landslide of raw emotion.

384
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,916
The past is dead
and gone, Julio.

385
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,166
All you can do now is set
your gaze to the future.

386
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,083
I'm afraid. But I'll try.

387
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:17,041
[EMA] Hm... Well, Germán,
even a broken clock

388
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,875
is right twice a day.

389
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,875
[JULIO] I wonder if people
will ever respect me,

390
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,958
the way they did the Boss.

391
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,083
[LEÓN] "You can forge
yourself into the man

392
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,125
you want to be," remember?

393
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,458
[JULIO]
Words to live by.

394
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:42,500
[metal clangs]

395
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,500
[GERMÁN]
So, wherefore this tête-à-tête?

396
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,416
[EMA] You know how they've
been recruiting new knights?

397
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,291
Yes, the Brotherhood
of the Black.

398
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,416
Candidates kill each other
for the privilege of joining.

399
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,916
Uh-huh. What you might
not know is they take

400
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,666
the winners down underground
before the ceremony

401
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,041
to initiate them
as knights begins.

402
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,583
[GERMÁN]
What awaits them?

403
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,125
Painted ladies and
booze aplenty?

404
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,416
Not likely.

405
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,333
A chambermaid said
she heard screaming

406
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,625
as she passed by
the door one night.

407
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,791
It was a man's voice.

408
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh, what did he say?

409
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:20,291
"Save me. Don't let that
demon take my body."

410
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,083
[GERMÁN] Either way, those
poor bastards are done for.

411
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:27,166
Perish in trial by combat,
or get devoured by a Horror.

412
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,833
What the hell is this?

413
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,125
[HORROR VOICE 6A]
If you want glory...

414
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,875
[HORROR VOICE 6B]
I'll let you feed...

415
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,083
[HORROR VOICE 6C] Honor and
admiration will be yours...

416
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:41,708
God above!

417
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:42,458
Save us!

418
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:45,500
[screaming]

419
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,291
It seems the creation
of our knights

420
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,125
continues apace.

421
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:03,250
[BERNARDO] Yes, but I'm
afraid one of your Horrors

422
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,375
has met with an abrupt end.

423
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,583
Was it a Makai Knight?

424
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,375
[BERNARDO]
Most likely, though I've reports

425
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,416
of a Makai Alchemist, as well.

426
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,291
[MENDOZA] Have the
Brotherhood of the Black

427
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,791
look into this matter
with all due haste.

428
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,666
[BERNARDO]
What? And deny myself?

429
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,958
[BERNARDO]
I will kill them.

430
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,875
See that you do, then.

431
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,625
[chuckles]

432
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:05,375
[GARM] Where do the children
go when the harlequin

433
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:09,000
plays upon his pipe and
music's on the wind?

434
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:12,041
To paradise or perdition?
