1
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,208
[LARA] Where are you
headed after you leave us?

2
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,833
If I were you, I'd go
somewhere nice and warm.

3
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:20,541
[MOTHER] Your hard work
made all of this possible!

4
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:21,958
[LARA]
If you had a mind to,

5
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,791
you'd be welcome to stay
with us indefinitely.

6
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,250
[GRANDPA]
Good work.

7
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:27,958
[LARA] Something tells
me Abuela's right.

8
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:31,000
Next year's going to
be a good harvest.

9
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,625
[LEÓN]
Here, let me.

10
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,291
[LARA]
Thank you.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,916
[LEÓN]
Something wrong?

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,833
No it... it's just not that
long ago I had to help you.

13
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:49,916
Doesn't seem fair.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,666
[LEÓN chuckles]
You prefer me lazy?

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,125
[LARA laughs]

16
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,208
Oh, look.

17
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:58,041
They used to call this place
the old fairy mound. Neat, huh?

18
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,375
Stories about it
go way, way back.

19
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,833
The fairies were said to
hold grand banquets here

20
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,625
once upon a time,
supposedly every night.

21
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,125
If you were traveling after dark

22
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,916
and some awful creature chased
you, you could hide here.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,666
Comforting, right?

24
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,125
But like I said,
the stories are old.

25
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,458
The Watchdog Center.

26
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:25,250
[LEÓN] This is an entrance.
No mistake, it must be.

27
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,708
How long has this
place been in ruins?

28
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:31,958
Still an effective barrier
against Horrors though. Huh.

29
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,208
[LARA]
León, hello?

30
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,666
What's gotten into you?

31
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,375
You do realize that there's
no such things as fairies?

32
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:38,791
Yeah, 'course.

33
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:42,166
Even if there were, this
village would hardly need 'em.

34
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:47,916
[LEÓN] It's obsolete.
All but forgotten.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,041
A lot like... me.

36
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,541
[LEÓN]
Let's go home, shall we?

37
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:01,750
[LARA] That look.
I've never seen it before.

38
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,458
[LARA]
We're home!

39
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,250
You two took your time.

40
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,916
How anyone can be so leisurely
gathering wood, I'll never know.

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,458
[GRANDMA] The prince himself
has come, young lady.

42
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,958
He's visiting his lordship at
the manor house as we speak.

43
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,000
Isn't that exciting?

44
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,166
[LORD]
As you see, Your Highness,

45
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,958
the land is rich in
beauty, but little else.

46
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,750
What we posses in quietude,
we lack in arable soil.

47
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,750
Do not underestimate
your treasure.

48
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,208
Peace is a thing to take
pride in, your lordship.

49
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,416
To have it as a neighbor
is a blessing.

50
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,458
Indeed, I am inspired.

51
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,958
[LORD]
We are not worthy, Your Grace.

52
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,583
The people will
thrill to see you.

53
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,625
How fares the city
of Santa Bard?

54
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,916
I trust the rebuilding
is near completion.

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,250
Yes.

56
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,708
That being said, one does
still hear of demons.

57
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,291
A handful are wreaking havoc
where there is quarter.

58
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,291
The wind of rumor reaches far.

59
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,416
A shame about Valdona
of Romero and Orvien.

60
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,875
Fortunately, rumor is
all that reaches us.

61
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,833
The demons keep their distance.

62
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,958
That is good to hear.

63
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:49,208
[VILLAGERS chatting]

64
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,833
[ALFONSO chuckles]

65
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:54,458
[DOG barking]

66
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,708
Uh! León.

67
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,083
[ALFONSO] I knew in
my heart you'd survived.

68
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,208
[LEÓN]
Yes.

69
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,958
I am glad to find
you in good health.

70
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,875
Uncle says precious
little on the subject,

71
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,833
but I know he's been worried.

72
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,541
[LEÓN]
I'm sure he has been.

73
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,958
Forgive me. Words fail--

74
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,958
[LEÓN]
Alfonso.

75
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,000
I understand the
weight of what I did.

76
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,875
And I know that
my agonizing over it

77
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,833
doesn't change a damn thing.

78
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,416
[LEÓN]
Little though it's worth,

79
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,083
for my crimes against
Valiante, I am deeply sorry.

80
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,750
I have done an evil thing.

81
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:40,583
I no longer have the right
to be a Makai Knight.

82
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,375
Wisdom often comes too late.

83
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,708
Only now do I understand
what my father meant.

84
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:48,250
What it is that compels men
of the armor to act as they do.

85
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,333
Why they fight.

86
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,166
Why they protect.

87
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,666
I was unfit to wield a sword

88
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,166
because I couldn't see
past my own hatred.

89
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,708
All of that feels like
another life to me now.

90
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,625
Yet I remember when
our paths first crossed

91
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,500
as though it were yesterday.

92
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,000
[ALFONSO]
I as well. Orvien.

93
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,583
I'm ashamed to say it,

94
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,875
but at the time I thought you
no more than a naïve squire.

95
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:16,000
[chuckles] Yes, well,
hardly an unfair assessment.

96
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:19,125
[LEÓN]
No. The real naïve one was me.

97
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,875
Without question.

98
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,541
So, were you as shocked as me?

99
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,333
Who'd have ever guessed he
knew such highborn people?

100
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:38,416
He comes from a
different world than us.

101
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,541
If I was him, I'd
pro'bly wanna go back.

102
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:46,875
Sooner or later, anyway.
It's bound to be warmer there.

103
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,958
[LEÓN] I didn't know what
it was to live under one roof.

104
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,666
We always just kept moving.

105
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,708
Home for me was a campfire
and the open road.

106
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,250
I thought I was worldly,
thought I had some experience.

107
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,625
But for all my travels,

108
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,875
I might as well have stayed
in my mother's belly.

109
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,916
All I cared for was revenge.

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,458
All I saw was fire.

111
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:11,083
It consumed me,
blinded me to the world.

112
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,666
Like I said, wisdom
often comes late.

113
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,208
León,

114
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:25,458
I used to wonder if I would've
handled things differently.

115
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,458
Were I in your shoes,

116
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:30,708
I'm not certain I could've
fulfilled my duties either.

117
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,625
Had it been my mother.

118
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:38,250
In truth, only the slightest
twist of fate separates us.

119
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:43,125
My condolences. I heard
about the queen.

120
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,333
When all's said and done,

121
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:47,375
'tis impossible to know
another man's mind.

122
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,958
People cannot know,
unless they have actually

123
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,916
experienced something
for themselves.

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,375
[LEÓN]
I agree.

125
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:58,125
Nicely said, and exactly why
they need your protection.

126
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,250
May I be the last
to bear such sorrow.

127
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:05,750
No one should ever have
to suffer like that again.

128
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,541
[ALFONSO]
I take pride in being chosen.

129
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,625
I will live up to
the honor as best I can,

130
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,666
doing right by the
armor at every turn.

131
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,375
Thinking always of you.

132
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,666
Yes, well, it's an honor
you were born for, cousin.

133
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,166
[ALFONSO]
León!

134
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,333
If I speak out of turn,
forgive me, but... you seem...

135
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:27,583
...you seem to have found
something you wish to protect.

136
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,750
[LEÓN]
That may be.

137
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,625
[LARA]
Uh.

138
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,541
[LEÓN]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

139
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:37,875
Let's go.

140
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,708
Oh. I thought...

141
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,625
[LEÓN] We were just
having a little talk.

142
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,666
Catching up, so to speak.

143
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,166
Don't act like
you're not leaving.

144
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,333
[LEÓN]
What?

145
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,333
[LARA] A man who
"catches up" with princes

146
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,666
isn't the kind of man who
settles in a place like this.

147
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,208
[LEÓN]
Think again.

148
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,458
I'm not going anywhere.

149
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,041
'Less, you're tired of me?

150
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,708
[LARA]
Mh-mh.

151
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:03,625
[LARA chuckles]

152
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,083
[LARA]
Race you home!

153
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,583
We'd best hurry. It'll be
dark 'fore you know it!

154
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,541
[LEÓN]
Whoa!

155
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,791
--[LARA] C'mon, find your feet!
--[LEÓN] Give me a chance!

156
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,916
[ALFONSO]
I'm not certain.

157
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,666
All signs point to it
being the work of a Horror.

158
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,416
Evidence suggests

Goodbye, Traveler.

321
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,375
It was nice having you.

322
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,541
I wish you could stay here.

323
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,250
Maybe next time,
take me with you.

324
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:04,625
[LEÓN crying]

325
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,875
[GARM] His only wish was to
protect that precious smile.

326
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:09,166
Yet again, he takes
up the blade,

327
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,208
consumed by the fires of hatred.
