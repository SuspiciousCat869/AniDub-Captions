1
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:27,125
[LEÓN]
I'm sorry. So sorry.

2
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,916
I wanted to protect you, but I--

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,291
Lara.

4
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,375
[LEÓN]
I wanted to protect you, but I--

5
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:44,750
Lara.

6
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,541
[ALFONSO]
León.

7
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,041
León, if there's anything
in the world I can do...

8
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:06,125
Here. This village
is no longer safe.

9
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,916
Protect yourself.

10
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,541
[ALFONSO]
That poor girl.

11
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,958
[ALFONSO]
You seem...

12
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,791
You seem to have found
something you wish to protect.

13
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,041
[LEÓN]
Uh.

14
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:30,750
[LEÓN]
That may be.

15
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,833
[ALFONSO]
Why did this happen?

16
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:35,625
León was finally at
peace with himself.

17
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:38,833
He had a sense of
purpose beyond revenge.

18
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:40,750
Should I have stayed with him?

19
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,416
Was I wise to leave?

20
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,583
What if--

21
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:47,250
What if vengeance
consumes him again?

22
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,291
[ALFONSO]
Oh, León.

23
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:01,666
[LARA chuckling]

24
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,458
[XIMENA]
Coming!

25
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,208
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

26
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,166
[ALFONSO]
Forgive me for intruding.

27
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,500
Would I be correct to assume
that Sir Germán is staying here?

28
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,583
May I speak with him?

29
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,416
[XIMENA]
Germán?

30
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,000
[ALFONSO]
That's right.

31
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,625
It's true he was lodging with
us, but now he's disappeared.

32
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,708
[ALFONSO]
Disappeared?

33
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes, sir.

34
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,416
I found his quarters
abandoned without warning.

35
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
To be honest, I'm a bit worried.

36
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,875
As am I, madam.

37
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,625
He's not a man to just vanish,

38
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,083
not without at least
leaving some word

39
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,458
as to when he'd be back.

40
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,875
Yes, exactly!

41
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:19,000
Germán is many things, but
to leave so unexpectedly--

42
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:22,625
I-- Uh, that is to say,
one can't imagine the reason.

43
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,625
[ALFONSO] Oh, but I can.
Shameless philanderer.

44
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,416
[XIMENA]
Your Grace?

45
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes, well,

46
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:31,291
on second thought I shouldn't
agonize over it. He'll be back.

47
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,208
Indeed. I certainly hope so.

48
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,291
[ALFONSO]
Blast it all, uncle.

49
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,666
I was eager to pick your brain
about what do with León.

50
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,833
Wherever he's gone, he'd
better have a good excuse.

51
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,916
[XIMENA]
Uh.

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,708
Germán!

53
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,291
You frightened me
to death, you fool!

54
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,041
Where on earth were you hiding?

55
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,125
[gasps] The prince
was only just here!

56
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,125
If you run quickly,
you'll catch--

57
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,500
[GERMÁN]
'S all right.

58
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,791
He and I will speak
soon enough, I'm sure.

59
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,666
There are far more
pressing matters at hand.

60
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,541
Such as reckoning the bill.

61
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,208
[XIMENA]
So you are leaving?

62
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,500
Can't be helped.
Business keeps moving.

63
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:19,875
Is it far?

64
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,708
[GERMÁN]
I don't know. Possibly.

65
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,458
But it will bring you
back through here?

66
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,000
It might at that.
Wish I could say.

67
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,250
[GERMÁN]
Huh?

68
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,500
I'm really sorry.

69
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,875
Oh, don't be. It's the
nature of these things.

70
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,791
No innkeeper expects the tenants
to stay on indefinitely.

71
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,416
Particularly ones
such as yourself.

72
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,125
You have ample coin, after all.

73
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,333
If you'd planned on settling in

74
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,166
for any appreciable
length of time,

75
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,625
you'd have rented
a room somewhere.

76
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,583
Much more cost efficient,
not to mention private.

77
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,416
I've lived in a lot of
places up till now.

78
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,000
Yet, this inn is the closest
I've ever come to having a home.

79
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,833
Because of you.

80
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,916
I shall miss you sorely.

81
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,208
[GERMÁN]
Please, Ximena.

82
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,583
[ALFONSO]
Huh?

83
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:15,250
Next year's wheat harvest
is going to be great!

84
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,416
[LEÓN] It might've been,
had you lived to see it.

85
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,875
I couldn't even get
you through the night.

86
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:24,083
All your hard work.
All your dreams.

87
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,291
Dust in the wind because
I couldn't protect you.

88
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,833
[FLAME] Because of
the Horrors, you mean.

89
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,083
[FLAME]
The Horrors destroy everything.

90
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:29,208
[LARA chuckling]

91
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:33,958
[FLAME]
Poor girl.

92
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,000
[LEÓN]
Uh.

93
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:41,000
[FLAME] Nothing left
for her now but to rot.

94
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,375
The Horrors stole her from you.

95
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,958
[LEÓN gasps]

spread, engulf, consume.

97

00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:07,583
[FLAME] If only I would.
If only I could.

99
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,958
Your hatred keeps me alight.

100
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:14,375
No, your very nature fans
the embers of my existence.

101
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,708
I am your hate.
Do not fight me.

102
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,208
Fight the Horrors that
brought us to this pass.

103
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,416
Destroy them! Annihilate them!

104
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,041
Go away!

[LEÓN yelling]

106
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,708
[LARA]
And that field over there.

107
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,041
In spring, it'll be covered

108
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,166
with white chamomile
blossoms everywhere.

109
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,541
They'll spread all the way to
the horizon. It'll be so pretty.

110
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,666
[gasps]

111
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,875
[FLAME]
She'll never see them.

112
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,416
Not one. Not a single blossom.

113
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,708
Her young life is folded
now in the common clay.

--Stop this.
--[FLAME] No tears.

Stop!

00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,833
[FLAME]
Tears are a weakness.

118
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,625
Let ash fall where
you would weep

119
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:24,041
and make the Horrors pay for
the pain they have wrought.

I was to leave you be.

Forgive me.

[LEÓN]
Alfonso, I beg of you.

127
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:14,958
Please, let me don the
Golden Armor once again.

128
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,833
[ALFONSO]
You wish to wear the armor?

129
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,000
Just like that?

130
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,041
[LEÓN]
Yes.

131
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,041
[ALFONSO]
Why?

132
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,916
[LEÓN]
To have power.

133
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,166
León, you mustn't let the
fires of revenge guide you!

134

Have you forgotten
the devastation

135
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,833
you brought to Valiante?!

136

'Course not.

137
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,458
I don't want revenge.

138
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,750
I only ask for
the power to defend.

139
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,291
To protect even just one person.

140
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,833
That they might see another day.

141
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:58,916
For them, I will pay any
price you deem worthy.

142
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,250
Help me honor the armor.
Help me... protect.

143
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:08,000
Very well. I shall.

144
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,333
But... we speak of
the Golden Armor.

'Tis not a thing to be
lent out like a toy.

Let us first test what
you say about its price.

Show me the heat
of your resolve.

Convince me you're equal
to the honor I would bestow.

However, should the
flames of your hatred

150
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,375
burn half as fiercely as
they did that fateful day.

151
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,250
[LEÓN]
Then please.

152
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,041
Cut me down.

00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,416
The spring you'll never see.

163
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,416
The flowers.

164
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,250
From this day forward,

165
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,291
I will protect all the
things you held dear.

166
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,666
Yes! That's the way:
control the fire within you!

167
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,250
Let it not light
the way to revenge!

168
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,416
[LEÓN grunts]

169
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:53,416
[yelling]

170
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,958
[FLAME] Let the fire
within you run wild!

171
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,458
Farewell.

172
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,333
Germán?

173
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,500
Dear god.

174
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,375
Trotting back to the frontlines
like this, must still be young

175
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,791
--to be such--
--[JIRUBA] You've aged without

176
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,000
[JIRUBA]
the benefit of wisdom.

177
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,625
Huh. Jiruba.

178
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,000
Certainly feels like an age
since last you spoke,

179
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,041
and here I thought you
rusted over years ago.

180
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,375
I speak when there is need;

181
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,458
particularly when
the need is desperate.

182
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,625
You'd do well to take heed, sir.

183
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,791
Still quick on
the uptake, I see.

184
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,416
And as friendly as ever.

185
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,375
How 'bout a favor?

186
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,416
Keep your eyes on me! Whatever
you do, don't look back!

187
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,208
You're going too fast!

188
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,458
[BOTH gasp]

189
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,875
[BOTH gasp]

190
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,458
[DORA]
Are you okay?!

191
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:31,958
[DORA gasps]

[HORROR howling]

193
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,916
Dora, make it stop!

194
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,958
God almighty, protect us!

195
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,541
[DORA gasps]

196
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,708
[LEÓN]
Hide.

197
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:05,666
[HORROR howling]

198
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,583
[ZARUBA] The Unruler
is a humanoid Horror.

199
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,208
If I may be so bold,
let me advise caution.

200
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,791
You haven't worn
the armor in a while.

201
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:14,833
[LEÓN]
Right.

202
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,708
Let us remedy that.

203
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:50,041
[HORROR howling]

204
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,541

[BOTH gasp]

211
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,791
[LEÓN]
Are you all right?

212
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,125
Thank you so much!

213
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,041
[rustling]

214
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,125
[LEÓN]
Uh.

215
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:49,916
[LEÓN growls]

216
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,166
Hello.

217
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,583
Where have you been?!

218
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,666
What the hell are you doing?!

219
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,416
Oh, just putting you
through your paces, m'boy.

220
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,958
I have to say:
a fine thing it is

221
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,166
to have you back in
the thick of it with us.

222
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,541
[LEÓN]
Likewise.

223
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,083
And what's this I see?
Zaruba on your finger again?

224
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,625
Can it be you've matured to the
point of earning his loyalty?

225
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:13,666
By all criteria, he is more
than qualified to don the armor.

226
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,833
[ALFONSO]
Uncle!

227
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:15,958
León has newfound
purpose in his vow and--

228
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,458
Oh, he's great, I know.

229
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,500
Congratulations, son!

230
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,458
I'm proud of ya.
There's one less thing

231
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,583
for me to worry about
on the job, at least.

232
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:25,875
[LEÓN]
On the job?

233
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,208
Ah, you mean the hunt.

234
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,708
No.

235
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,291
[GERMÁN]
Actually.

236
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,250
My orders involve yours
truly serving Mendoza

237
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,333
for the time being.

238
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,125
[LEÓN]
Old man!

239
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,625
I couldn't have heard you right!

240
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:44,875
[ALFONSO]
Or else,

241
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,458
you can't mean for us
to take that seriously.

242
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,458
Is it even possible
the man still lives?

243
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:52,166
[GERMÁN] Surprise, surprise.
Miracles never cease. It is.

244
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,000
[ALFONSO]
How can that be?

245
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,458
You're out your mind!

246
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:57,125
Even if he is alive,
why would you help him?

247
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,833
Because the Watchdog
Center tells me to.

248
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,875
The idea actually
has some merit.

249
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:04,166
Being a protector
works both ways.

250
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,708
What the--

251
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,625
[GERMÁN] Well, time waits
for no man, least of all me.

252
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,041
Safe travels.

253
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,041
I didn't want you to fret over
what came of ol' Germán.

254
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,041
Now, promise not to follow.

255
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,000
Uncle, please!

256
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,125
See you 'round, gentlemen.

257
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,333
[LEÓN]
Old man! Wait!

258
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:21,875
[ALFONSO]
I don't understand.

259
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,541
[LEÓN]
Neither do I.

260
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,416
[GARM]
The freedom he so desired.

261
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,166
The wings he so
longed to spread.

262
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:12,208
And alas, the future he lost.
