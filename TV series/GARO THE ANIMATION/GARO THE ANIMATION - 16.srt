161
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,708
at the peak of recovery, the
human body is an apothecary,

162
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:44,291
producing substances
irresistibly delicious!

163
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,666
[VILLAGER B gasps]

164
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,208
[XIMENA gasps]

165
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,708
Including last night, ten people
have disappeared in two weeks.

166
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,000
Most certainly the
work of a Horror.

167
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,708
This is a map on which the home
of each victim has been marked.

168
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,416
[GERMÁN] Our culprit's hunting
grounds are expansive.

169
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,375
[ALFONSO]
Yes.

170
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,708
In spite of my efforts,

171
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,250
I cannot determine where
the next strike will fall.

172
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,875
I'm inclined to think
the monster itinerant.

173
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,125
Very well, I shall begin
making rounds this evening.

174
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,125
I am in your debt, good uncle.

175
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,791
Ugh! Stop! That obsequious
manner is driving me crazy!

176
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,083
[gasps]

177
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:52,625
[XIMENA]
That's Prince Alfonso. Why?

178
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,333
Y'see, our ruler pays
no mind to such trifles.

179
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,833
A noble fellow indeed.

180
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:01,291
Germán... is more than he seems.

181
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,500
[XIMENA]
Excuse me, Señor Germán?

182
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,708
Yes? At your service.

183
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,333
[XIMENA] Well, you see, when
I found you in the street

184
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,333
don't misunderstand I was very
grateful you chose our inn.

185
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,833
I can't quite tell
where this is going.

186
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,291
Ah. Then let me be upfront.
Do you or don't you

187
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,500
have ulterior motives
for lodging here?

188
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,125
That's a loaded question.

189
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,083
I, guess...

190
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:28,166
Well... Uh... To be
fair, not really?

191
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,791
Sorry! I shouldn't've asked!

192
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,375
Whatever wind brought you here,
thank you for your business.

193
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,500
Up to now, anyway!

194
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,291
[GERMÁN]
Wait! Uh.

195
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,208
What just happened?

196
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,750
[ALFONSO] I apologize for
keeping you waiting, uncle.

197
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,166
[sighs]

198
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,500
[grunts] Uh. You-You look
like you've been to hell.

199
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,500
Think nothing of it, m'boy.

200
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,458
Whatever inferno my
personal life may be,

201
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,791
my duties as a Makai
Knight stand firm.

202
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,250
Let's go.

203
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,375
[MIKEL]
Something troubles you, my dear.

204
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,083
What?

205
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,291
I've not been sleeping
very well of late.

206
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,291
[MIKEL]
Oh?

207
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,625
Insomnia portends
many an illness.

208
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,375
What robs you of your slumber?

209
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,916
I'm afraid I haven't a clue.

210
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,833
[MIKEL] I've no particular
need of you today.

211
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,791
Suppose you go home and
catch up on your rest.

212
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,666
[MIKEL]
Miss Ximena!

213
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,125
[MIKEL]
Oh, no.

214
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,041
[XIMENA'S DAD]
Damn.

215
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:23,041
This is intolerable.

216
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,916
Ah. It's you.

217
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,375
Uh, sir, might I ask
where your daughter is.

218
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,041
Poor Ximena's in the
care of Doctor Fabian.

219
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:34,291
She collapsed unaccountably
just a few days ago.

220
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,083
[MIKEL] Four nights gone
since the malady appeared.

221
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:44,500
Her fever remains high,
but the boils have subsided.

222
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,666
A hopeful sign.

223
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,750
The symptoms lingering
are treatable.

224
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,208
A combination of ma huang,

225
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:54,791
licorice, and cinnamon will
hasten her convalescence.

226
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,791
I have outshone my predecessor.

227
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,208
The plague which brought
Doctor Fabian to his knees.

228
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,083
is mine to conquer.

229
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,333
How rich and succulent
her flavor will be

230
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,875
as she wards off this
pestilence. I cannot wait!

231
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,666
[GERMÁN]
Doctor! How is she?!

232
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,708
[MIKEL]
Better than you suppose.

233
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,541
[GERMÁN]
Ximena.

234
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,083
Germán.

235
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,833
Come, be strong.

236
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,000
You will beat this.

237
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,166
[MIKEL]
She's fine.

238
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,833
By nightfall, she'll be
able to take solid food.

239
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,625
[GERMÁN]
That's good.

240
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,875
[MIKEL] I'll be moving on once
she's made a full recovery.

241
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:45,041
I admire your efforts on behalf
of the townsfolk, doctor.

242
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,416
You're a true Samaritan.

243
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,208
[MIKEL]
I'm pleased to be of service.

244
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,458
Alas, as sickness admits of
no border, I must be itinerant.

245
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,416
[grunts]

246
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,041
[MIKEL]
Señor Germán?

247
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:58,166
Uh, I... must be going myself.

248
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,000
I thank you for
taking care of her.

249
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,166
Clearly, she is in gifted hands.

250
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,958
[MIKEL laughing]

251
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,458
[MIKEL]
Exactly as I predicted.

252
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,791
I will take my time savoring
this triumphant body.

253
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,083
An ultimate reward for
the ultimate physician.

254
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:28,041
[GERMÁN] Your prey never
brought you off the beaten path.

255
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,083
[MIKEL yelps]

256
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,250
They flocked to you from
every corner of the realm,

257
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,458
did they not, Doctor?

258
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,666
[MIKEL]
A Makai Knight?

259
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,708
You devoured your patients
like a wolf in winter.

260
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,416
[MIKEL]
That's not true.

261
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,333
I didn't devour all of them.

262
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,750
I eat only one human
being per day.

263
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:49,708
To permit binging is to court
distemper of the humors!

264
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,291
[MIKEL] I've treated far more
than I've treated myself to.

265
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,875
Let me assure you, sir,

266
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,333
The number of lives I've ended

267
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:03,333
are nothing compared
to the ones I've saved.

268
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,666
Would you destroy me?.

269
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,208
I'll wager that you've
saved fewer than you think.

270
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:11,958
The human will to survive is
much stronger than you realize.

271
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,416
We rise above and
carry on, come what may.

272
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,500
That will is what a Makai
Knight is sworn to defend!

273
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,083
[MIKEL]
I see.

274
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:22,250
If only there were a cure for
such stubborn pig-headedness!

275
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,166
[GERMÁN grunts]

276
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,375
[MIKEL groans]

277
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:45,666
[gasps]

278
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,083
[GERMÁN]
What is that?!

279
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,208
[MIKEL] Nothing less than
the glorious culmination

280
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:52,083
of my acumen as a
healer, foolish knight!

281
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,916
I'm a genius, you see!

282
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,291
A practitioner of my
art like none other.

283
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,916
[MIKEL]  My strength waxes.
My power overflows!

284
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
[GERMÁN grunts]

285
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,291
[GERMÁN yells]

286
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,541
[MIKEL roars]

287
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:15,375
[MIKEL]
Ah.

288
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,875
Lacerations on head,

289
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:20,166
left antebrachial region
and right brachial region.

290
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,250
Compound fracture of
the right femoral bone.

291
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,583
Slight damage of
the internal organs.

292
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,333
[MIKEL groaning]

293
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,583
[MIKEL]
I must treat you!

294
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:30,916
What?

295
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
[MIKEL] Damn it! The urge
to heal is too strong!

296
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:37,333
Stay away from me! No!
What the hell are you doing?!

297
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,500
[MIKEL]
Calm yourself.

298
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:41,250
You'll be right
as rain in no time.

299
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,541
[GERMÁN groaning]

300
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,166
[GERMÁN]
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

301
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,791
[MIKEL] This is much too
potent for a normal person.

302
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,958
But for a Makai Knight?

303
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:54,458
[GERMÁN groaning]

304
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,250
Seriously?

305
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,083
I feel like a powerhouse!

306
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,875
[MIKEL]
No infirmity is beyond my skill.

307
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,958
Let us test it further.

308
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,125
You'll probably regret that.

309
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,791
[GERMÁN yelling]

310
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,375
[MIKEL]
No! No, how dare you?!

311
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,500
Bastard.

312
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,291
Germán.

313
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,041
Ximena. You-You've awakened.

314
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,208
Seems I have. How
observant of you.

315
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,916
'S good to see you well.

316
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,791
You caught a touch
of the plague.

317
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,125
Oh, dear.

318
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,916
Father's had to manage alone.

319
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,583
Don't give it a thought.

320
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,833
Doctor's orders are
uninterrupted rest.

321
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,666
You mustn't let the pestilence
get a foothold again, my dear.

322
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,458
[gasps]

323
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,291
I mean, my friend!

324
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:29,333
Germán, I saw you meeting
with His Highness the Prince.

325
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,375
I can't imagine what brings
an aristocrat like you here,

326
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,958
but it's none of my affair.

327
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,500
Wait... I'm an aristocrat now?

328
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:37,708
You must be.

329
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,125
What other reason
would a prince have

330
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,583
for paying deference to you?

331
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,791
You're a very silly woman.

332
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:46,791
I resent that. I saw it.
Do not mock me.

333
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,333
Let's mull it over
carefully for a moment.

334
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,125
Can someone as
unsophisticated as me

335
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,583
be so high born as all that?

336
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,625
Now, I shan't deny
what you witnessed,

337
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,500
but your interpretation's
a bit romantic.

338
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,000
[XIMENA]
Oh, is it?

339
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,750
I'll explain some other time.

340
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:06,750
So, you don't consider this
place beneath you? Really?

341
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,958
I don't stay where
I don't feel at home.

342
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,958
[XIMENA] Please, if you felt at
home you wouldn't be so polite.

343
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,083
Ugh. There's no
winning with you.

344
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,208
Is it my peasant hands
that repulse you?

345
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,708
Or my clothes?

346
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,750
Uh. What are you
babbling about, Ximena?!

347
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,166
Your hands are adorable
And your clothes.

348
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,541
Ugh! Now you're
teasing me, ogre.

349
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,708
Ogre? Your fire's back
at full bore again, eh?

350
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,000
Would you please shut up?

351
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,041
I must give thanks
to Doctor Fabian.

352
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,416
Imagine if he hadn't
come to our town.

353
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,875
Indeed.

354
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,625
Alas, I'm afraid the good
doctor had to be on his way.

355
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:43,708
He asked for me offer you
a farewell in his stead.

356
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,458
So it goes.
He follows his calling.

357
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:51,500
There are many people out there
yet to benefit from his help.

358
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,750
Oh. What a strange little bird!

359
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,750
Hello there!

360
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,958
Aw. I guess no one stays.

361
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,375
[GERMÁN]
Hmm.

362
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,375
[XIMENA]
Germán?

363
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,958
Your face is enviable.

364
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,541
What?

365
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:10,833
I, uh... I should like to see
it around for a good while yet.

366
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,125
You know, the things you say

367
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,875
leave me feeling
quite perplexed.

368
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,500
[XIMENA]
What does that mean?

369
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,500
[GERMÁN] Nevertheless, if the
lady wishes to behold my face,

370
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,708
let her sleep content to
see it when she awakens.

371
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,250
I take special pride in
this illustrious beard.

372
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,958
[chuckles] Yes, you do.

373
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,500
Now. Trade the
chit-chat for rest.

374
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:31,416
Germán?

375
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,083
[GERMÁN]
Hm?

376
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,541
Thank you very much.

377
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,000
[GERMÁN]
Of course.

378
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:55,458
It is exceedingly rare
for you to call upon me.

379
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,375
Rest assured I did
not summon you here

380
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,250
for the pleasure
of your company.

381
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,458
State your business
and be done with it.

382
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:04,166
I'd much prefer to
be in a warm bath.

383
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,666
Very well. Until further notice,

384
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,208
you and Mendoza will
be partners in the field.

385
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:13,166
What? Surely you're joking.

386
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:20,958
[knocking]

387
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,333
[XIMENA]
Germán?

388
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:24,625
[door closes]

389
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,916
Where'd you go?

390
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,541
[GARM]
The quiet dark of night.

391
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:08,916
The heavens bestow
a delicate, white gift.

392
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,250
Why must the snowfall
be so fleeting?
