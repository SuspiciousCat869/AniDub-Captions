1
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,333
[LEÓN]
I couldn't have heard you right!

2
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:15,916
[ALFONSO]
You don't seriously mean that?

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,916
Is it even possible
the man lives?!

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,291
[GERMÁN] Surprise, surprise.
Miracles never cease.

5
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:21,208
It is.

6
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:22,416
[LEÓN]
You're out your mind!

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,083
Even if he is alive,
why would you help him?!

8
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,541
[GERMÁN] Because the
Watchdog Center tells me to.

9
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,583
The idea actually
has some merit.

10
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,541
Being a protector
works both ways.

11
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,083
I didn't want you to fret
over what came of ol' Germán.

12
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,166
[ALFONSO]
Uncle, please!

13
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,041
[GERMÁN]
Now, promise not to follow.

14
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:36,083
[LEÓN]
Old man!

15
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,416
Wait!

16
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:53,583
[ALFONSO]
Hm.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,375
[ALFONSO sighs]

18
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,000
[gasps]

19
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:07,583
[LAURA gasps]

20
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:08,958
--[ALFONSO] Uh.
--[LAURA] Ah!

21
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,250
[ALFONSO]
Forgive my carelessness.

22
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:15,083
[LAURA] Uh! I-I'm sorry,
your Highness!

23
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,750
The fault was mine entirely!

24
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,291
I ought to have moved.

25
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,416
[OCTAVIA]
Our apologies, Your Grace.

26
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,125
You attend to the king.

27
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,583
My utmost gratitude, ma'am.

28
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,125
You do me a great honor.

29
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,000
Uh, yes! A great honor!

30
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,291
[ALFONSO chuckles]

31
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:34,375
[sighs] Well, that
was unexpected.

32
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:36,416
Uh... uh!

33
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,583
Laura. You are a
lady-in-waiting.

34
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:40,541
Pray, look sharp.

35
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:41,916
Yes! Look sharp!

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,291
Thank you, Miss Octavia.

37
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,291
Sorry.

38
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,208
[MAID A] How many times
must that girl be told?

39
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,708
One does not envy Octavia
having such a novice

40
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,083
constantly underfoot.

41
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:56,375
God's truth, she's not worth
the breath to scold.

42
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,583
Thank heavens! Miss Ema! León!

43
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,333
You're unharmed!

44
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,000
Forgive me, Alfonso,

45
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,666
but there was no reason
for you to worry about me.

46
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,708
Your injuries rather
give the lie to that.

47
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,333
And what's become of your hair?

48
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:14,958
[EMA]
I'll ignore that last remark.

49
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,583
But if by injuries you mean
these minor scratches,

50
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:18,666
I have just the thing.

51
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,208
She's slowly pickling herself.

52
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,291
Is that so? Who are
you to criticize?

53
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,708
Someone who cares more for
your health than you do!

54
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,166
Uh, now now friends!

55
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,208
Other matters require
our attention.

56
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,875
Please, come inside.

57
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,250
So, cousin.

58
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,583
Did she fare as well
as you hoped?

59
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,625
Should I even know what
that is intended to mean?!

60
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh. Have I offended you?

61
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,333
If you'll allow it,

62
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:42,875
I'm more than happy to
answer in the boy's place.

63
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,500
Shut your mouth!

64
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,500
I've been given to
understand she's hunted

65
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,541
that particular Horror
for quite some time.

66
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,708
Oh, uh. It's over now.

67
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,541
She did her duty admirably.

68
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,000
[ALFONSO]
I see.

69
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,250
Well. That's a blessing.

70
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,166
[LEÓN sighs]

71
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,041
I know my old man.

72
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,041
He probably made
the whole thing up.

73
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,375
[ALFONSO]
No.

74
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,333
I beg your pardon, but not
even he's that careless.

75
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,666
And lest we forget,
Mendoza's a gifted Alchemist.

76
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,000
It's possible he
crafted some illusion

77
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,875
whereby he only
appeared to have died.

78
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,458
His conjurings are vivid.

79
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,791
When we fought, I'd never
seen anything like them.

80
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,750
I've been investigating
on my own.

81
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,875
Thus far, I've rifled
through his old quarters.

82
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,791
And down in the cellar where
Zirkiel's Circle was stored.

83
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:17,458
Alas, I haven't yet searched
the subterranean temple.

84
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,875
[LEÓN]
That place.

85
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,541
I wouldn't be surprised
to find something there.

86
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:25,416
There's also a maid.
Her name is Octavia.

87
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,291
What about her?

88
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,708
She is a lady-in-waiting,

89
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,833
responsible for the
care of my father.

90
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,416
Last night, quite late,

91
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,333
she was seen leaving
the palace chapel.

92
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,500
So, can we not assume
the woman was praying?

93
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,916
[ALFONSO] Perhaps, but her
doing so in the dead of night,

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,250
alone, seems worthy of note.

95
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,833
The chapel connects with
the underground temple.

96
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,500
You are a godsend, Octavia.

97
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,916
Truly. Where would I be
without your kindness?

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,166
[OCTAVIA]
I am flattered, Your Majesty.

99
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,958
[MAID B] His Highness,
Prince Alfonso, Your Grace.

100
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,791
Let him come in.

101
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,000
[footsteps]

102
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,375
[ALFONSO]
Father!

103
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,291
I've brought the friends
I was telling you about,

104
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,166
if you've the strength
for company.

105
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,958
What say you?
May they come in?

106
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,625
Ha! Of course.

107
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,583
Please. Bid them to enter.

108
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,625
León. Miss Ema.

109
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,958
[LEÓN]
León Luís, Your Majesty.

110
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,166
[EMA] Ema Guzmán,
it's indeed an honor.

111
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,333
Yes. You've helped my son
in times of great need.

112
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,583
I've looked forward
to meeting you both.

113
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,541
Sire. If I may be so bold,

114
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,041
I presumed to bring
Your Highness tribute.

115
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,208
Wine. From the vineyards
of Paolagena.

116
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,708
Famed far and wide for
its medicinal properties.

117
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,208
[OCTAVIA gasps]

118
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,583
I cordially accept
your offering.

119
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,166
A word of caution Sire,

120
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,666
sufficient quantities
can numb the senses.

121
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,375
Duly noted, young lady.

122
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,541
That may be the quickest
way to recover.

123
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,666
[EMA, FERNANDO laugh]

124
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,708
[LEÓN]
She certainly isn't a Horror.

125
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:14,791
[ALFONSO]
No.

126
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,375
Perhaps my suspicions
were unfounded.

127
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,500
For now, though, let
us think of dinner.

128
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,583
You must be famished
from travel.

129
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,666
Please, won't you
dine with me tonight?

130
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,250
Oh! Oh, my, I couldn't turn
down such royal hospitality.

131
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,750
I won't make you insist.

132
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,500
You'll want us to stay
the night as well?

133
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:36,375
[LAURA] May I ask a question,
Lady Octavia? I, uh...

134
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,666
Sorry, I shouldn't babble.

135
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,291
Out with it, girl.

136
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,708
Um, well you see...

137
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,625
I was curious as to your
opinion of Prince Alfonso.

138
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:45,958
Oh, dear! I'm sorry!

139
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,000
It's terribly presumptuous
of me to ask!

140
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,875
I'm simply overwhelmed
by the kindness

141
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,500
he showed me this afternoon.

142
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,583
That kindness had nothing
to do with you,

143
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,041
it is simply in his nature.

144
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,000
Don't read so much into it.

145
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,708
No, yes, of course, ma'am.
I understand perfectly.

146
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,250
But bearing that in mind.

147
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,041
You care for His Majesty's every
need, supposing he were to,

148
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,291
that is to say, if he asked--

149
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,000
Yes. Without a second thought.

150
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,458
[gasps]

151
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,208
They say to covet is a sin,
but even ladies in waiting

152
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,083
may dream of better
for themselves.

153
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:17,000
Uh... Yes, but dreaming a
thing doesn't make it so.

154
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,875
Believe me, Laura.

155
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,333
I am aware.

156
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,916
[LAURA gasps]

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,583
One almost covets your
simple-mindedness.

00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,875
Well, I never...!

159

[ORLETTA]
Well, I never...!

160

Do you hear what comes
out of your mouth, Tavia?!

161

[OCTAVIA]
Should the King ever see fit

00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,208
to take me as a wife, you
can be my lady in waiting.

163
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,083
[LAURA]
Uh! You don't mean that?!

164
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,250
Of course you don't,
you're only teasing me.

165
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,833
I assure you I'm not.

166
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:45,083
Loyalty is dear, I prefer the
company of those I may count on.

167
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:48,875
Oh, but, Surely there is
someone more capable than me?

168
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,750
Truth be told, Laura,
you remind me of someone.

169
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:52,625
[LAURA]
Uh?!

170
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,500
Let's finish clearing the table,

171
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,250
there's something special
I'm eager for you to see.

172
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:07,541
[footsteps]

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,291
Good evening, Octavia.

174
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,333
[OCTAVIA] I've brought
you something to eat.

175
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:27,625
It is a meager repast, to be
sure, and for that I am sorry.

176
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,875
I do not mind.

177
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,708
His Highness the Prince
moves ever closer.

178
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:36,291
May I ask if we really
intend to leave the boy be?

179
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,833
He and his comrades amuse me.

180
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,125
Let the retinue of fools
occupy themselves

181
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,500
as they please, I am impervious.

182
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,625
I care not the cost,
I will not allow them

183
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,333
to cause you the
slightest inconvenience.

184
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:51,166
Even if it means
sacrificing my life.

185
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,500
[MENDOZA]
Do not speak of death

186
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,291
as though it's what
I wish for you.

187
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,708
[gasps]

188
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,541
[MENDOZA]
Octavia. You are my servant.

189
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,875
Please, am I to toss you
aside like battered toy?

190
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,833
[OCTAVIA sighs]

191
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,041
Take care to stay alive.

192
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,083
'Twould cause no end
of inconvenience

193
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,208
should you be cleft from me.

194
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,583
I understand, sir.

195
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,958
--[ALFONSO] Where were you?
--[WOMAN gasps]

196
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,625
Do not think to answer
me with silence.

197
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,875
Would you dare play the mute?

198
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:05,125
[LAURA gasps] I know this looks
terribly questionable, but-- Uh!

199
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,250
Laura, what are you...?!

200
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,583
[screams]

201
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,041
What is the meaning
of all this?

202
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,541
I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to!

203
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,875
I, uh, I'll clean
this up at once!

204
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,333
That's not what I meant.

205
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,875
What is someone like you
doing in a place like this?

206
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:25,458
[LAURA] I-I was collecting water
from an underground spring.

207
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,875
It was discovered not long
after the castle was damaged.

208
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,166
Water began bubbling up

209
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,500
from one of the broken
flagstones down here.

210
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:36,250
I can't tell you the last time
I've known water of this purity.

211
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:41,250
So, we're using it
in the King's meals.

212
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,333
Oddly enough,
it dries up at sunrise.

213
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,291
It has quite a clean taste.

214
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,916
How did you find this place?

215
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,041
I'm not the one
who found it, sire.

216
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,541
It was my Lady Octavia.

217
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,125
Lady Octavia?!

218
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,708
[LAURA]
Yes, sir.

219
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,125
She mentioned having discovered
it during the reconstruction.

220
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,041
[ALFONSO sighs]
Interesting.

221
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,791
She thought it prudent
to collect water

222
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,416
herself at first, you see.

223
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,041
However, recently,
we've been taking turns.

224
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,166
The care she gives to
His Majesty commands

225
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,875
so much of her time.

226
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,875
Is that so? Clearly measures
must be taken to increase

227
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:16,791
the number of servants.

228
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,958
Oh! You don't have to!

229
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,458
I wasn't complaining, really!

230
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,625
I didn't think you were.

231
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,625
[sighs] Thank goodness.

232
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:30,291
Oh! I mean...
that is to say, um...

233
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,375
You... seem to get thrown
out of sorts rather easily.

234
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,000
A calmer demeanor might
be worth cultivating.

235
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,750
I hear that a lot.

236
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,208
[chuckles] I'm sure you do.

237
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,208
[ALFONSO] Sorry to have
given you such a start.

238
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,916
Treat yourself
to a spot of rest.

239
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,375
Thank you! That would be
wonderful, Your Highness!

240
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,666
I apologize if this exchange
has inconvenienced you.

241
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,250
Good night!

242
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,333
[ALFONSO]
Mm... Good night.

243
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,708
[EMA] There's no sign
the seal's been broken.

244
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,875
All right, friends.
Let's see what terrors await us.

245
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,333
Uh?!

246
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,625
Ah. I'll just take
the rear, then.

247
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:33,750
Oh, my I've never felt more
like a princess in my life!

248
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:38,208
[LEÓN] Pillars once
stood here, I believe.

249
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,250
[ALFONSO] I suspect so,
but they were gone

250
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,625
before Miss Ema and
I sealed the entry.

251
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,875
In all likelihood,
Mendoza created them to

252
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,625
summon the Makai beast.

253
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,000
[EMA] As if my flesh weren't
already crawling.

254
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:54,000
We should've paid attention
the last time we were here.

255
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,833
Indeed.

256
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,375
[ALFONSO]
What's wrong?

257
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,791
[EMA gasps]

258
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,541
Zaruba, do you sense
anything at all?

259
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,000
Nothing out of the ordinary, no.

260
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,416
Just a fancy.

261
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,791
Let us go.

262
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,250
[EMA exhales]

263
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,958
You really expect Mendoza
to be on the castle grounds?

264
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,125
I'd have a better idea

265
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,875
if I could speak to
uncle on the matter.

266
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,708
[LEÓN] Maybe we should
interrogate Garm?

267
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,666
And waste our time?

268
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,500
'Twould be a much finer thing
to douse ourselves in drink

269
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,583
and let the clues seek us.

270
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,250
[MENDOZA]
Excellent. Admittedly,

271
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:58,250
I was fretful of Zaruba and the
meddlesome Makai Alchemist.

272
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,666
Our reservations were
unfounded, master.

273
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,250
[MENDOZA]
So it would seem.

274
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,333
I am amused at the effort spent

275
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,583
creating such a powerful
barrier in the first place.

276
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:11,041
Their suspicions are quickly
dropping by the wayside.

277
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,875
[MENDOZA]
I am pleased to hear it.

278
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,041
[knocking]

279
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,875
I shall be in touch.

280
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,458
[LAURA]
It's Laura.

281
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,625
Yes. You may enter.

282
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,833
The bath has been drawn and is
ready for His Majesty, ma'am.

283
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,500
That's excellent.

284
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:28,708
And, were there any problems?

285
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,375
None to speak of!

286
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,083
For the moment, all is well.

287
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:35,583
In that case, report back
to me only after His Majesty

288
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:39,291
has retired to bed. Later
tonight, I shall look in on him.

289
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,708
Uh. Yes, ma'am. Very good.

290
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:42,500
[OCTAVIA]
And Laura?

291
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,875
Uh, yes?

292
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,875
Carry yourself with confidence.

293
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,833
Should you misstep,
be willing to learn from it.

[ALFONSO]
Which way?!

Above us!

302
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,083
Is that possible?!

been praying every single day.

00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,958
If he was capable of saving us,
he'da done it by now.

I never...!

308
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,875
Do you hear what comes
out of your mouth?

309
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,583
Lucky for you, God is
merciful to wayward souls.

310
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:32,875
I'd watch myself, though.

God will save us!

Believe it in your

We have but to wait.

323

We pray every day!
He'll show us mercy!

324

I know He will! Please, Tavia!

325

For once, you must
have faith in Him!

I promise He will save us.

This I swear.

For when you've exhausted
all other options.

suffice to release it.

Father and I have
just had a word.

377
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,000
Forgive me, please,
but I have to ask,

378
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,166
did anything about her strike
you as odd before tonight?

379
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,541
Would that it had, my prince.

380
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,916
I know.

381
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,333
The mind struggles
to believe it of her.

382
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,708
Your Highness.

383
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,166
May I be allowed to
rest now, please?

384
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,041
Yes. Of course.

385
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:06,416
I'm very sorry for what you've
had to endure tonight, Octavia.

Thank you for so bravely
protecting my father.

[LEÓN] Well, whoever was
here, they clearly used

395
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,083
another way to make
their escape.

396
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,166
Yes, there may be a
number of other ways

397
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,583
in and out of which
we know nothing.

you all to leave it be.

Let's be plain. Continue to
pursue this line of inquiry

404
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,375
and things will get
unpleasant.

00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,958
Will you just do me the
kindness of retreating now?

Of course not.

you would listen to your father?

out of our way...
