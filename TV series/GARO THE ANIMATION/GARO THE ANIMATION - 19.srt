[NICHOLAS]
Oh, I see.

2
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:15,958
I take it you're
a Makai Alchemist?

3
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:17,458
[EMA]
Tell me something, you wretch.

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,541
Does the name Luciano
mean anything to you?

5
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:21,458
[LEÓN] I thought you
hated us Makai Knights.

6
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:25,166
Oh, I do. Especially those
who've only seen a bared breast

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,250
while they're nursing.

8
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,833
[GARM] Will you continue
your own search?

9
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:30,958
Then may your quest bear fruit.

the thing I'm hunting

Hunting, you say?

13
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,166
I've a Horror in mind.

14
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,708
[GERMÁN] I have to say,
a fine thing it is

15
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,791
to have you back in
the thick of it with us.

16
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,291
Actually.

17
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,250
My orders involve yours
truly serving Mendoza

18
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:46,458
for the foreseeable future.

What's the meaning of this?

[ALFONSO]
Oracle, please!

22
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,000
He asked you a question!

23
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,083
What in God's name
would possess my old man

24
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,875
to align himself with Mendoza?

25

How does the serpent still
live?!

00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,541
And why weren't we
told this before?!

27
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,166
We have the right to an answer.

28
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,750
I cannot for the life of me
conceive of exoneration

29

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,458

[ZARUBA]
It is fruitless, León.

34
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,875
Garm is not to be pried.

35
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:25,416
She discloses only that which
she wishes to disclose.

36

Ah, incidentally,

there's another matter the

Very soon... she is
going to meet her demise.

It's almost time, Luciano.

Almost time.

[ALFONSO]
Her blatancy rattles me.

43
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,250
Though 'tis clear Garm
is merely attempting

44
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,000
to deflect our misgivings.

45
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,250
Yes, but it's equally clear

46
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,750
we can't abandon Ema
to face her doom.

47

I'm aware of that.

48
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,125
Garm is a damnably
effective manipulator.

[ALFONSO grunts]

50

Leave it to me, Alfonso.
You dare not stray away

great length of time.

[LEÓN]
Garm told us about you.

Said you were hell-bent on
tracking a particular Horror.

That you were willing
to sacrifice your life

No offense, but you first

How could you?!

00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,708
You vowed to deliver us from
this fate! You're a monster!

00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,083
What you've done
is unforgivable!

We did everything we could.
There was no saving the man.

Once a Horror, there
is no hope of return.

I'm very sorry.

175

You at least were saved. Yes?

For that much I am grateful.

Don't touch me!

[MAKAI KNIGHT A] And, of
course, that Luciano fellow

00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,458
is brooding again.

184
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,750
He's still convinced
there must be some way

185
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,000
to keep human beings
from becoming Horrors,

in lieu of hunting them.

187
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,291
Many a mind has
pondered the question

188

before that damned fool.

189
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,083
If there was a way, we'd
have discovered it long ago.

190
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,458
[MAKAI KNIGHT A] Yes, precisely.
That's my entire point.

191
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,208
There are limits to what
even the most accomplished

192
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,750
of Alchemists can do.

193
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:29,375
Horrors are dealt with by steel,

[HORROR D]
You cannot save them.

Toil as you might,
they are a lost cause.

196
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,166
You grapple with
an impossibility.

197
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,750
They cannot be saved.

198
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,291
The world is
shrouded in darkness

199
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,791
and there is nothing to be done.

200
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,666
In the end, we're
only saving those

201
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,333
who've yet to become
Horrors themselves.

If all we do is kill,

203
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:17,166
those we vow to protect
eventually become our quarry.

204

If a Horror can be

Yes, yes. I know.

I'm an incurable romantic.

207

But I have to believe
there's a spell

00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:30,541
that can keep the Horrors
from getting a foothold.

209

You'll find it one day.

This isn't your fault.

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,208
There's no reason we
have to keep doing this.

220
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:22,083
We can carve out a new
life somewhere else.

though everyone is gone.

Beyond pathetic!

What have I always said about
the blasted Makai Alchemists?

233
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,625
They're only one step removed
from Horrors themselves.

234

Don't worry, Ema Guzmán, you did
well in coming to us with this.

Even as we speak,
our comrades in arms

are leaving no stone
unturned in their search.

Thank you, sir.

238

Now, I would like to join them
without delay. He's my husband.

239
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,958
I feel it only proper that I
should be the one to seal him.

240
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,625
Not only is there
no need, it's unwise.

241
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,541
Because Luciano Guzmán
is your husband,

242
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,875
you stand a great chance of
becoming a Horror yourself

243
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,416
before this is over.

I'm afraid we've little choice

but to restrain you
for the time being.

This is absurd! For God's
sake, I know my heart!

It is clear I cannot rely

257
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,750
on the power of
the Makai Knights.

258
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:43,666
I must end this myself...
as I promised.

259
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,791
[EMA] The Horror that played
on Luciano's despair must die.

By my hands alone.

261
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,750

The search has taken years,

262

but I finally tracked
him here to Paolagena.

263
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,750
And this is where
it all has to end.

264
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:07,375
I would gladly kill you before
I let you interfere again.

265
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:10,750
I didn't come here to serve
a Horror our kind of justice.

I came to protect
the townspeople

and, incidentally, you.

for hunting Luciano.

figure out why he would though.

isn't special to him.

Hey...

321
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,375
What's the matter?
Can't you hear?

322
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,666
You have a fever.

323
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,541
You don't need another
drink. You need rest.

324
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,291
[EMA]
Ugh. Cabrón!

325
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,208
Don't tell me what I
need! I'm celebrating!

326
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,541
Now! Another! Immediately!

327
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,000
I won't ask you again!

328
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,041
[LEÓN]
Stop!

329
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,833
You'll tear the
stitches wide open!

330
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:15,583
And you reek!

331

[EMA]
Cállate, chico!

332
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,333
Dammit, Ema!

[LEÓN] Talk to me.
Where are you in pain?

335
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,166
[EMA]
It's finally over.

336
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,416
[LEÓN]
Yes, finally.

337
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,708
Luciano has found his peace.

338
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,875
Get some rest. Everything will
be all right now, I promise.

Don't you dare!

341
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,625
You were a child the
last time I saw you

342
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,541
and now you talk to me
like an goddamned adult?!

[GARM] It is no small thing,
putting one's trust in another.

348
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:12,208
Having done so, all roads
lead to the same end.
