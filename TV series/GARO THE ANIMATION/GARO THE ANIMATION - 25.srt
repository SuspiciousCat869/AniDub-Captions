These children were

Look. You can tell it's special.

Mother never said what kind
of magic it possesses,

happen to know this thread

to open her door.

He is a very kind man.

downtrodden orphans like us.

He's promised to watch
over us. I don't want to...

How did it go?

Round and round, spinning

All the love I have
growing faithfully

If I guard it carefully I pray

That our lives, then woven,
evermore will stay

Tina would be the one to inherit

But not now, once she's grown.

Care to explain to me

Because it looks as
though you're making off
