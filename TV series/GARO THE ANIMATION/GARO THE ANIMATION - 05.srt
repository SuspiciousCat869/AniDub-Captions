'Tis plain they're not human!

If they answer to Mendosa
as you say, what is their aim?

17
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:13,083
What could they possibly want?

18
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:16,125
They are known as Horrors.
Creatures of the dark.

19
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:19,750
Beings of evil that
live to consume us.

Horrors, you say?

21
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:24,875
[RAFAEL] Mendoza exploits
a forbidden Madou device

22
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:28,250
that bridles and directs
Horrors to answer to his will.

him, he would use

to rule the kingdom

Sir, as heir apparent,
I have a duty to this land!

My mother needs me, as do the

Yet, as I am, my skills
are unequal to the task.

I haven't the prowess to slay
these things as you do.

if you do not know yourself?

37
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:17,125
The truth must be
brought to light.

The truth of what?

Such vile, poisonous creatures

have been hunted

go to bed at a reasonable hour.

Ah, yes, of course.
I see the logic.

[sighs, gasps]

70
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,166
[RAFAEL] In ages past,
Horrors were a bane of which

71
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,333
every man, woman,
and child were aware.

72
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:06,791
Those who fought them
were lauded as heroes,

73
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,291
but time wore on,
and people forgot,

74
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,583
as they are wont to do.

75
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,958
Now those who fight Horrors
are persecuted as witches,

76
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,833
tortured, burned.

77
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,166
[ALFONSO grunts]

78
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,375
[RAFAEL] Your kingdom has
set its share of fires.

79
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,416
Violence against man
is forbidden to us.

80
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,000
Unable to defend themselves,
dozens, no, hundreds

81
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:34,041
of my comrades have lost their
lives to ignorance and ambition.

82
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes, Mendoza had a
singular passion for

83
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,458
inciting hatred against witches.

84
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,833
Was that part of his plan?

85
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:46,750
Aye, he reviles our kind.
Knights, alchemists, allies.

86
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,750
He would have us, and
our kin, all murdered.

87
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,250
[ALFONSO] Then the Knight of
Light isn't just a legend,

88
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,208
he's real.

89
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,583
[RAFAEL]
The Golden Knight, Garo.

90
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,416
The blood that coursed through
his veins is within you.

But of course, there's
a new moon tonight.

93
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,250
[GERMÁN]
I should've known.

94
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,875
This is the one day
of the month when

95
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:20,083
the Golden Knight lies
in torpor. The day when

96
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:24,291
Madou Ring Zaruba claims a
portion of the vessel's life.

97
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:28,208
[sighs] And that's
all I can remember.

98
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,375
I should've asked your
mother for more detail.

99
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:35,333
[RAFAEL] The armor of a Makai
Knight is passed down by blood,

100
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,750
so it is with the Golden Knight.

101
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,291
Once there lived in
Valiante a witch,

102
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:45,833
sentenced by Mendoza to burn for
the crime of hexing the king.

103
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,375
In truth, she was
a Makai Alchemist,

104
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:52,041
and she carried within her the
grandson of the Golden Knight.

105
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,500
Even as she died,
she gave birth.

106
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,833
An infant emerged
from the flames.

107
00:07:56,916 --> 00:08:00,000
Thus the Golden Knight's
bloodline survived.

108
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,333
I know the story well.

109
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,875
A man rescued the boy,
and there's been no sign

110
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,666
of either of them since
that fateful day, long ago.

111
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,833
[RAFAEL]
Yet as it happens,

112
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,500
the child was not
the woman's only kin.

113
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,083
She also had a sister.

114
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,541
[ALFONSO]
What were their names?

115
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,458
Anna Luis. She was
the condemned.

116
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,125
Her younger sibling...

117
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,041
[RAFAEL]
...Esmeralda.

118
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,625
[gasps]

119
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:30,333
Anna Luis held a sacred duty,
to fight as a Makai Alchemist,

120
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,000
but also to continue
her father's bloodline,

121
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:36,500
so that his golden armor
could be passed down.

122
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,000
Esmeralda was
adopted by nobility,

123
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,916
spared the life of a warrior.

124
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,958
She lived happily, her
every need attended to.

125
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,791
[RAFAEL] She's a fine woman,
but she's lived in ignorance:

126
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:56,000
of her elder sister, of Horrors,
of the truth of her own birth.

127
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,500
[ALFONSO gasps]

128
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,083
She was kept unaware.

129
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,791
Only two people knew the secret,

130
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,791
myself and the
man who possessed

131
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,375
the golden armor of old.

132
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,375
Your own grandfather.

133
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,958
Mother wore this from
the time she was a girl.

134
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,791
She said it acted as a kind
of protective talisman,

135
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,375
but she didn't
know against what.

136
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,375
After Anna's son inherited
the Golden Armor,

137
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,750
my role consisted
in keeping vigil.

138
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:28,208
To watch from the shadows.
Only if misfortune befell

139
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,166
you was I to make
my presence known.

140
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,208
[gasps]

141
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,541
Mendosa now realizes
you're of the blood.

142
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,166
His hatred of the Makai Knights
cannot be overstated,

143
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,500
believe you me.

144
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,750
Hence the man's mendacity.

145
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:49,250
Please, you must answer me this,
if I am indeed descended

146
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,958
from the blood of those
who fight Horrors,

147
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,791
this means that I too have
the power to defeat them?

148
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,375
[RAFAEL]
Mm.

149
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,291
[ALFONSO gasps]

[MENDOZA]
What of the Queen?

187
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,708
[OCTAVIA] She has been
vigorously questioned.

188
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,333
The interrogators are
confident of her ignorance.

189
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,375
[OCTAVIA] She knows
nothing of her pedigree.

190

What would you
have me do with her?

191

disappear at our leisure.

to the Vatican, sir?

200
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:21,750
That is impressive.

203
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,416
[RAFAEL] Your grandfather
excelled in battle as few men

204
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,458
before him, a warrior
from head to toe.

205
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,958
However, a worldly
man he was not.

206
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,791
Concealing your mother's
origins fell to me.

207
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:39,291
I personally arranged
her adoption by nobility.

208
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:42,625
Your grandfather hadn't
the nuance for such things.

209
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,958
Not that I orchestrated her
ascension to Queen, mind you.

210
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,375
That twist of fate
surprised even me.

Valdona.

214
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,041
Count Romero's domain.
Do you know of it?

215
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,875
[ALFONSO] Of course. The Land
of Grapes, they call it.

Circumstances, namely you,

224
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:46,250
led me from my intended path.

225
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,875
This was to be my
original destination.

226
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:03,125
But, sir, Count Romero is held
in great esteem far and wide.

227
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,250
He is a lover of
music and literature,

the proud patron
of many an artist.

I'm sure that was all
true at some point.

be in Sahnta Bard.

318
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,250
[GERMÁN]
We've made it.

319
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,291
[LEÓN grunts]

320
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:05,875
[GARM] A man who once
called himself friend.

321
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,916
Now a light extinguished.

322
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,833
What depths of night
do those eyes reflect?
