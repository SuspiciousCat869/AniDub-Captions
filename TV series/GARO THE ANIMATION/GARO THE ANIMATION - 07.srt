Please, hold on!

Earlier with Agatha,
you called me Pepe.

211
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,125
But how do I know if
that's true or not?

212
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,541
You mean to say
you have no memory

213
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,625
of who you are?

214
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,083
Yes.

215
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,500
I see.

216
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,500
We're only here
talking like this

217
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,541
because I saved your life.

218
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,208
You needed to get out
of the village in a hurry.

219
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,458
So I approached a band of
acrobats and convinced them

220
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,666
to spirit you away to one
almshouse in particular.

221
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,458
One only meant for the
children of Lograja.

222

[LEÓN] Lograja. I've
heard that name before.

223
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,500
I'm almost certain of it.

Look, I have much to do,
and little time to do it.

Wait for me, Agatha, right here.

Pepe needs to see the priest
before we can embark.

Okay, sure!

251
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,208
Agatha's the daughter
of a close friend.

A fellow Makai Alchemist.

253
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,333
Her husband died young.

254
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:47,166
Happily, though, she was able
to fall in love again,

255
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,375
the second time
around with a barber.

256
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,333
He'd been married before, too,

257
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,333
and had a son named Pepe.

258
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:57,416
The boy grew to become one
of Agatha's favorite people.

259
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,791
But five years ago,
a rumor spread

260
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,750
that the barber was a werewolf.

261
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,458
Both husband and wife were
slaughtered in their home

262
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,208
by a band of panicked townsfolk.

263
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,500
I dreamt about that night.

264
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,958
How did a little girl
survive the carnage?

265
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,666
Her brother was wise.

266
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,041
He hid the child in the attic
at the first sign of trouble,

267
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,208
then he made his own escape.

268
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:22,416
That was the last
anyone ever saw of Pepe.

269
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,291
There was talk that a
traveling band of acrobats

270
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,291
lured the boy into
their clutches.

271
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,500
What do you believe?

272
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:34,041
[VASCO] I think they sold
him into slavery long ago.

273
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,666
Agatha had no one left,
so I took her in

274
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,625
and raised her as my own.

275
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,833
She'd been sick at heart
over the loss of her family,

276
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:45,958
so she's hung all the hope she
could muster on the dream that,

277
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:50,083
one day, her brother Pepe
would return for her.

Pepe. You hunger for revenge.

You're a damned waste of space!

Hey! Answer me!

What are you afraid of?
You gonna cry?

Is it really?

Ema told me what happened
during the fight.

That you lost to the
man in the dark armor.
