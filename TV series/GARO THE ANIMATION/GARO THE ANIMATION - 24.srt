1
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:53,500
[ANIMA roars]

2
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,833
That's great.

3
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,625
The monster has a force field?

4
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:10,333
[ANIMA roars]

5
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:11,291
[LEÓN]
Uh!

6
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,541
[ZARUBA]
The chance is slight,

7
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:16,083
but we have some capacity
to neutralize it.

8
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,458
[LEÓN] Yes, well, some is
more than enough for me!

9
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:23,041
[MENDOZA] How disappointing.
Seems not even this creature

10
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:27,125
is invincible. Death
is still its master.

11
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:30,666
Alas, no living thing
escapes the icy grip.

12
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,291
This flesh and blood are
forever moored to decay.

13
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:39,250
Fate is cruel. Wouldn't
you agree, Golden Knight?

14
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:42,416
I don't know about all that, but
you're about to know firsthand.

15
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,458
[MENDOZA] A-ha! I am not
subject to the same laws!

16
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:50,333
I shall drink of
immortality. Mark me!

17
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:54,375
Now, this moment,
I alone will transcend!

18
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,500
[MENDOZA gagging]

19
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:57,541
Uh!

20
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,541
[EMA groans]

21
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,833
[ALFONSO grunting]

22
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,250
[LEÓN panting]

23
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,708
[MENDOZA]
A curious sensation.

24
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:07,375
I imagined the power of God
as a searing white flame.

25
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:12,583
Rather, 'tis cold like a vein
of some implacable ore.

26
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:17,458
[EMA grunts, panting]

27
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,208
[ALFONSO groans]

28
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,416
[MENDOZA] However this gift
chooses to manifest itself.

29
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,041
Let us test its boundaries.

30
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,416
[LEÓN]
Mendoza!

31
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,583
[LEÓN yells]

32
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,958
[MENDOZA chuckles]

33
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:56,750
This power surpasses the wildest
boundaries of imagination!

34
00:04:56,833 --> 00:05:02,291
Death is my master
no more. I am eternal.

35
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:05,000
Really? Live it up now,
freak of nature!

36
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:08,208
Damned if I'll let whatever you
are run loose in this world!

37
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,000
You wound me in vain.
Can you not see that

38
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:33,750
my destruction is simply
beyond the skill of any man?

39
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,833
Indeed, not even God
himself can stop me.

40
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,250
And you are an insect.

41
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:43,625
[LEÓN groaning]

42
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,208
You are not the end of me, boy.

43
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:50,041
No mere Makai Knight shall
have the pleasure of undoing

44
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:54,500
such unfathomable power.
Impossible.

45
00:05:55,958 --> 00:06:01,333
[ALFONSO groaning]

46
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,875
On your feet! Rise like a man!

47
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,416
Once you've taken
up the sword,

48
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,250
you've made a solemn pact until
your last shuddering breath!

49
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,416
If there's a drop of
blood left in your veins,

50
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,708
how dare you give up?!

51
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,125
Master, I...

52
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:22,166
Now stand! Your fight
has only just begun!

53
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,375
Draw deep and recommence!

54
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,125
You must fulfill your
sworn duty Alfonso,

55
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:30,208
to protect this land
as a Makai Knight!

56
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:39,416
Master, thank you.
Duty ever comes first.

57
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,125
I'm coming, Keep fighting, León.

58
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,375
The Golden Knight is
to me but a child.

59
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,583
Thus wound I the Council
fools who spurned me.

60
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,416
You vile, pitiable saplings.

61
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,750
Grasping at the shadow of
immorality through procreation.

62
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:01,875
Blood is meaningless.
You inherit only death.

63
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,500
Should you succumb before
passing on your seed,

64
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,125
you leave a barren legacy.

65
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:12,541
[MENDOZA] The very idea is
contemptible! A fool's gamble.

66
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:17,291
Look upon me. This body's
the realization of what man

67
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,583
only dreams of!

68
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:19,541
[LEÓN]
You're wrong.

69
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,166
[MENDOZA]
Mm?

70
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,875
[LEÓN]
I understand now.

71
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:26,500
I know the nature of
what I've inherited.

72
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,000
[LEÓN yelps]

73
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,041
[LEÓN] Our forebears
passed down something.

74
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,666
Beyond themselves.

75
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,708
Beyond death.

76
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,541
[LEÓN groans]

77
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,333
They were merely animals
that reveled in carnality.

78
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,750
Foolish and desperate
to extend their blood.

79
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,250
They barely had a taste
of the immortal life.

80
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:57,541
Sewer rats are nobler. At
least they are not deceived.

81
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,375
[LEÓN] Our legacy is more
than just bloodlines.

82
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,625
It's our desire to protect!

83
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:15,875
[panting] We are not cowards.

84
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:19,375
We face death for the
sake of the future!

85
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,000
Naïve boy.

86
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:26,958
[EMA groaning]

87
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,000
[gasps]

88
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,250
Germán's blade!

89
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,958
[EMA]
Of course.

90
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:46,958
Now, let us have done
with this once and for all.

91
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:50,250
I'm not about to let you rest
on your laurels yet, friend.

92
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,791
Damn fool.

93
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,458
León!

94
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,666
[EMA]
Alfonso!

95
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,916
[EMA yells]

96
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,916
You're still alive! Uh!

97
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,333
[ALFONSO grunts]

98
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:19,375
Uncle... No...

99
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:24,375
[ALFONSO yells]

100
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:28,083
León!

101
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:16,041
[LEÓN] What we inherit
is larger than ourselves.

102
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,458
[LEÓN roars]

103
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,500
[LEÓN grunting]

104
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,041
[LEÓN] Someone like you could
never hope to understand.

105
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,416
Why should one such
as I even care

106
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,250
to comprehend a
vermin's feelings?

107
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,875
[LEÓN]
Well, Old man. Here we go!

108
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,166
[LEÓN yells]

109
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:09,583
You still fail to comprehend.
I cannot be slain boy.

110
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,375
[LEÓN grunting]

111
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,916
[ZARUBA]
León! The gate is closing!

112
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,375
[LEÓN gasps]

113
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,250
[MENDOZA]
And now what are you doing?

114
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,375
[ALFONSO] León! He means to
banish Mendoza to Makai!

115
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,333
Don't do it! You won't
be able to return!

116
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,666
León!

117
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,125
[MENDOZA]
Clever, aren't we?

118
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,958
You intend to keep me
here indefinitely?

119
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:05,083
Alas, that won't be so easy!

120
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,458
[LEÓN]
Uh!

121
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,875
[LEÓN]
I don't think so!

122
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,833
[MENDOZA] You do realize you'll
be trapped here as well?

123
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,625
[LEÓN]
It doesn't matter.

124
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,291
[MENDOZA]
Hmph.

125
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:38,041
Not a very fast learner,
I see. I told you I cannot--

126
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,875
[MENDOZA gasping]

127
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,583
[LEÓN roars]

128
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,708
What are you doing?

129
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,500
[MENDOZA screams]

130
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,791
[LEÓN grunts]

131
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,916
You are the epitome
of foolishness.

132
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,375
León!

133
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,625
[ALFONSO]
Miss Ema.

134
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,458
--Hold on.
--[EMA groans]

135
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,041
Listen, Alfonso!

136
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:32,666
I... If I lose consciousness,
just strike me until I awaken.

137
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,000
We cannot let this gate close.

138
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,708
León will be trapped
in Makai forever!

139
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,541
[ALFONSO]
Understood.

140
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:44,041
[MENDOZA] It appears your
idiotic friends beg to differ

141
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,541
on the issue of you
remaining here.

142
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,416
[MENDOZA]
Heh. Concede defeat.

143
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,333
Can you not see this
struggle is pointless?

144
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,750
Even if the gate closes,

145
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,125
for me it's merely a
matter of outliving you.

146
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,708
And so I shall. Before long,

147
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:02,291
some cretinous soul
will open another gate,

148
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:06,000
once more unleashing me
upon the world above.

149
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,333
[LEÓN]
The defeat is yours to concede.

150
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:12,000
I will die, but another
Knight will rise in my place.

151
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:15,208
And after him,
another, and another!

152
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,083
As long as the line
of Makai Knights

153
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,291
and their Alchemist
allies carries on,

154
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,750
you will never know freedom!

155
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,833
And someday, maybe
centuries from now,

156
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:30,666
maybe eons, they will find a way
to end you, once and for all!

157
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,625
If I cut the string,
it will all be over.

158
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,583
Witch's bastard.

159
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,916
[LEÓN]
Ema...

160
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,541
Alfonso...

161
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,125
[LEÓN screams]

Give our precious son the
honor of carrying on this fight.

Loving fire.

were stoked by revenge.

is the meaning of this?!

She shouldn't be
pushing herself.

You may interpret my silence
to mean there is not a problem.

my words are necessary.

Calm down, León.
