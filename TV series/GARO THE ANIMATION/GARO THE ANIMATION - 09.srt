I am Rafael Banderas.

A friend of the late Golden
Knight, God rest his soul.

3
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:21,708
[ALFONSO]
Please, sir!

4
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,166
Teach me to drive these
devils back to the hell

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,958
from whence they came!

6
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,375
[RAFAEL]
How can you know the enemy

7
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,375
if you do not know yourself?

8
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,750
The truth must be
brought to light.

[RAFAEL]
So be it, then.

12
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,291
From this moment forward,
you'll come to know

13
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,333
all that falls within
my power to teach.

14
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,791
[RAFAEL]
Any fool can just swing a sword!

15
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,208
Allow the knight's blood
within you to guide

16
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:03,041
the path of your blade, for only
then may you vanquish your foe!

[GARM]
The Knight of Defense, Gaia.

27
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,083
You've grown rather haggard

28
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,083
since last you showed
your face here.

29
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,458
Meanwhile, you're
the same as ever.

30
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,083
Maybe to mortal eyes.

31
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:38,000
These days, it's all I can
do to stay awake up here.

32
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,625
The moment of well-deserved
retirement draws near

33
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,208
for the both of us.

34
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,416
[RAFAEL] I have come in search
of a Horror with which

35
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,291
to train my young protégé.

36
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,125
The more brutal the demon
you can find, the better.

37
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,541
Oh?

38
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:54,583
Perhaps the Chimera of
Orvien would suffice you.

39
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,833
It takes its name from
the ancient highway

40
00:03:56,916 --> 00:04:00,250
along the length of which
the beast is known to appear.

41
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,541
Wherever it goes,
the Chimera has been known

42
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:06,583
to sate its hunger on
entire villages at a time.

43
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,041
If rumors ring true,
the creature is swathed

44
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,666
in the ghastly remains
of its victims,

45
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,541
skulls and rotting flesh
telling of its past victories.

46
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,958
A few intrepid souls
have set off to hunt it

47
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:22,125
over the years, never to be
seen or heard from again.

48
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,375
[RAFAEL] And you've been
content to just let the beast

49
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,041
continue its reign of terror?

50
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,750
[GARM] We've been short handed.
It's on our to-do list!

51
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,458
[RAFAEL]
Orvien, you say?

52
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,375
[GARM] The Chimera may be
more than you want to throw

53
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,250
at the boy for mere training.

54
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:39,500
After all, he's no
good to you dead.

55
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,250
[RAFAEL]
There is no time.

56
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,041
Oh?

57
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,208
If he dies, that's
the end of it.

58
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,333
He was never going
to be the one.

59
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,666
[GARM]
Hm.

60
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:02,500
My. This parlor is
seeing many a guest.

61
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,500
Well met, Garo.

62
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:10,333
You've never had occasion
to pay me a visit ere now.

63
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,166
Tell me, Miss.

64
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,916
In this place, are you master?

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,500
You may call me Garm.

66
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,250
You come without your
father, young knight.

67
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,000
For the moment, I pursue
my training alone.

68
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,250
Such growth requires
a worthy foe.

69
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,208
Know you where I might find one?

70
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,333
[sighs] That's all you
knights ever want.

71
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,000
It's not as though our world is
just chockablock with Horrors

72
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,625
of awesome power, you know.

73
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,375
But you're in luck.

74
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,958

your needs like a glove.

Come, let's eat.

[ALFONSO]
Sir?

85
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,916
I've taught you everything
within my power

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,125
to pass along.

87
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,666
[gasps]

88
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,916
Nothing is left but
to vanquish a Horror.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,291
A Horror? I'm to kill one alone?

90
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,291
Are you afraid?

91
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,375
No, sir.

92
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,416
It's just for all
of my training,

93
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,291
I have yet to land
a single hit on you.

94
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,291
Mendoza's scheme continues apace

95
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,416
whether you're ready
for him or not.

96
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,375
The day draws near when he will
fill the land of Valiante

97
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:45,875
with as many Horrors
as Hell can vomit forth.

98
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,958
Once he does, we'll
have lost our chance

99
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,208
to defeat him.

100
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,791
Mendoza will claim Valiante
and your parents

101
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,000
will be put to the sword.

102
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,291
Tell me how I can stop
this from coming to pass!

103
00:06:56,375 --> 00:07:00,083
The Orvien highway is home
to a particularly brutal beast.

104
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:04,708
Many a brave knight has lost his
life in attempting to defeat it.

105
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,583
[ALFONSO]
So I'm to vanquish it, then.

106
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,791
[RAFAEL]
Can you, boy?

107
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,125

Yes.

[HORROR 9A roars]

109
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,166
No, it's useless.

110
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,666
That fight posed no
challenge in the slightest.

111
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:29,291
[LEÓN]
I need more power.

112
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,916
Which means a greater foe.

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,041
It seems that the
Chimera must be my fate.

114
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,500
Once you have successfully
overcome this trial,

115
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,666
you may then don the sacred
armor of the Makai Knighthood.

116
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,083
Indeed!

117
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,958
[ALFONSO] Ah-- Are you coming
along with me, Master,

118
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,541
or am I to travel
to Orvien alone?

119
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,583
Does it matter?

120
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,666
No, Master. I'll
take my leave now.

The highway is just ahead.

That was one of
my finest pieces,

127
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,625
brought here from
distant shores!

128
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,125
That was worth a fortune!

129
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,625
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,791
But I'm afraid you're the one
who came crashing into me,

--my good sir.
--First you destroy my pot

132

and now you're making excuses?
I should charge you double!

133
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,625
Wait, charge double?

134
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,291
[MERCHANT 9A] That pot would
still be in one piece

135

if it weren't
for you, young man,

136
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,291
and you're gonna pay me for it!

137
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,208
[ALFONSO] But, sir,
I'm not to blame for this.

138
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:55,708
Hold on. Your "finest piece"
is not what it seems.

139
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,916
You. Stop exploiting the man.

140
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,541
I've never been so offended
in my whole life!

141
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,541
One of you had better pay me
for that pot before I go and--

142
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,458
[whimpers] Nevermind!

143
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,416
Just watch where you're going!

144
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,958
[LEÓN]
It's a common trick. Be careful.

145
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,416
I never would have guessed it.

146
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,375
I'm grateful for your
help here, sirrah. Ah--!

Well hello, handsome!

148
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,458
New in town? Decided
where to stay yet?

149

[ALFONSO]
No. Not really.

150

[BROTHEL WOMAN 9A]
That's perfect!

00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,833
You can stay at our place!

It's not much to look at, but
the perks are out of this world!

[ALFONSO]
I'm in your debt.

157
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,458
I much prefer this tavern to
what that woman had in mind.

Is it your first
time passing through

159
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,750
a place like this?

160
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,125
Ah. You can tell?

161
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,041
It's true, I suppose I
should have guessed as much.

162
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,125
I stick out a bit.

163
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,708
Come to think of it, I never
did introduce myself.

164
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:53,875
I'm León Luis.

165
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,208
It's a pleasure to
meet you. I'm Alfonso.

166
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,875
Huh? Same as the crown prince.

167
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,083
It's been a burden on me,
ever since he ran away.

168
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,666
What're the odds of that?

169
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,166
Look, Alfonso?

170
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,375
Tomorrow, I must be on my
way again, so do you think

171
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,916
you'll be all right on your own?

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,458
Worry not.

173
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,791
You see, my destination lies
not very far from this place.

174
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,291
Does it, now?

175
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,125
[ALFONSO chuckles]

176
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,125
[PREVIOUS GARO] When you
are lost, consult your blade

177
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:34,166
and ask "Who is it
I must protect?"

178
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,958
[LEÓN]
Who is it I must protect?

179
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:39,375
[PREVIOUS GARO] Therein lies
the answer to everything.

180
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,416
[LEÓN]
Whatever it is I'm lacking,

181
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,541
the Chimera shall grant it!

182
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,958
In the dead of night?
A man? Or devil?

[ALFONSO, LEÓN grunt]

185
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,916
What? Alfonso?

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,583
Huh? León? What are
you doing about?

187
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,166
Uh, the same question,
my friend, I could ask of you!

188
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,166
I was sure that a thief
haunted my steps.

189
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,625
As for me. I just wanted
to get some fresh air.

190
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,750
You know, clear my
head a bit. Bye!

191
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:17,833
Hey!

192
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,125
[ALFONSO] What? León?
Are you following me?

193
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,583
[LEÓN] Maybe I wanted to
clear my head as well!

194
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,416
Don't you think it's time
you went back to the inn?

195
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,500
[ALFONSO] Not really.
Won't you please turn around?

196
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,583
[LEÓN]
You should take your own advice!

197
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:46,166
[RAFAEL panting]

198
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,125
[RAFAEL]
Stay with me, son!

199
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:55,375
[RAFAEL'S SON] Father,
I-I hope you can forgive me.

200
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:59,375
Your Gaia armor no
longer has an heir.

201
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,791
[RAFAEL gasps]

202

[RAFAEL groans]

203
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,958
Look at you.

204
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:28,000
Here to goad me
back up onto my feet?

205
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,500
Don't worry, old friend.

206
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,250
I still have work to do
ere I breathe my last.

207
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,375
[LEÓN] Go back to the
damn inn, Alfonso!

208
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,208
Where I'm going is
no place for you!

209
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,583
Your life is in grave
danger out here, so go!

210
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:57,000
[gasps] Yes, it is.

211
00:12:57,083 --> 00:13:00,708
But my duty spurs me onward
to valor, come what may.

212
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:01,958
What duty?

213
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,375
Clearly, you've come
here for a purpose.

214
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,500
But I wonder if maybe our
reasons for walking this highway

215
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,166
are one and the same--

216
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,000
What the--?

217
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,541
Beware. The Chimera
of Orvien is coming.

218
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,083
Where did you hear that name?

219
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,500
León.

220
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,125
You and I are both on the
hunt for the same Horror.

221
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,375
[LEÓN, ALFONSO gasp]

222
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,333
What the hell is that thing?

00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:46,791
[LEÓN grunts]

224
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:49,750

León!

225
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,958
[LEÓN]
Alfonso! Get to safety!

226
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,708
This is my prey, and mine alone!

227
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,625
[ALFONSO]
Forgive me, León.

228
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,833
I must be the one
to fell the beast!

229
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:03,458
Only then will I be a Makai
Knight in word and in deed!

230
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,916
Much depends on my
success here tonight!

231
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,750
That sword will do nothing!

232
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:18,583
Maybe not. But
vanquish it I shall!

233
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,500
If my lack of strength is
the death of me this night,

234
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:25,166
then I have failed
a most sacred trust!

235
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,666
My family and my people
will reap the consequences!

236
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,750
And so! I must become
a Makai Knight,

237
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,833
no matter what the task
may take from me!

[gasps]

239
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,708
Then you just leave
those scythes to me,

240
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,875
and stay focused on attacking
the bulk of the edifice!

to finish it, I'm sorry.

You and I are not
the only people

259
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,875
that thing could kill!

260

I'm sorry, Mother.
Forgive me, Father...

Up and on your feet, Alfonso!

shuddering breath!

You're ready, boy!
Take up my blade!

I leave it to you, Alfonso.
The armor of Gaia!

297
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,958
No, Master. You can't!

298
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,750
Quickly! You have
to slay the beast

before it's back
at full strength!

much I don't know!

I am still your master.

Listen to me as I give
this last command.

303
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,416
With this armor and blade,

304
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,916
henceforth become
a Makai Knight!

like you is more

320
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:39,333
For everything you have
taught me, I-I thank you.

321
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,916
[RAFAEL]
Enough! Get you hence, Gaia!

322
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,666
Surpass me. Become the knight
who serves as a shield for all!

323
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:11,500
[ALFONSO sobbing]

324
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,708
[ALFONSO]
My Master.

325
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:19,208
I swear, on blade and soul
alike, I will defeat the Horrors

326
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:24,541
that plague Valiante and guard
its people to the very last!

327
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:30,708
[ALFONSO sobbing]

328
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:06,208
[GARM] Ambition is the
deadliest of poisons.

329
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:10,458
Plant it within a human,
and watch the sins blossom.

330
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:11,750
Forever.
