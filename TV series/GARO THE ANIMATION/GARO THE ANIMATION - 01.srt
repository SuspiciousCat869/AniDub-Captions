The witch hunts of Valiante.

While being burned at the stake
for cursing King Fernando,

64
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,666
the witch Anna gave
birth to a child.

She bartered away her soul
to Hell in trade for magic,

How'd you like me to tell you
the God's honest truth

about witches? Far from
being in league with demons,

130
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,708
it's a witch's job
to seal 'em away.

Seal away?
How so?

132
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,083
Shouldn't that be
handled by a priest?

133
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,208
Priests can't do
anything about 'em,

after they executed that witch

who was said to have cursed him?

142
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,625
That means the hex died with
the woman who placed it.

[GERMÁN] Maybe.
Maybe it was just a coincidence,

00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,166
or maybe the witch was framed.

[PROSTITUTE]
By who?

147
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,166
A demon.

Or a human who's in league
with 'em, at the very least.

149
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:07,208
[laughs] Impossible.

If they were real,
these demons of yours,

151
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:15,083
we'd be hearing about attacks
damn near every day.

152
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,333
You know, this work's had me

warming beds in capitols
and backwaters alike,

154

and I've never laid eyes
on a single one

[PROSTITUTE] Easy now!

you for the type.

my lust for life, though.

love thy neighbor as thyself!

[MENDOZA] Ah, so my

I've received word of
a father and child

near the outskirts of Leiden
whose deeds are passing strange.

195

Leiden. So they fled
the kingdom after all.

[MENDOZA sighs] It's no wonder
we couldn't find them.

you speak of,

did they mention whether
it's a boy or not?

If it is,

200
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:14,500
he could ruin everything
we've been working so hard for.

I've been thinking about
what you told me before.

205
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,583
Have you ever seen a demon?

206

Not about that.
Thing is,

209
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,583
they don't look the way priests
always make them out to.

210
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,166
In fact, a lot of the time,
they're closer to animals.

211
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,125
They devour the unwitting
from the inside out.

212
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,333
After that, they assume
the prey's identity.

213
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,125
No one's the wiser,

gets hungry again.

All right, let me ask
you something.

I've been hearin' rumors
about this place,

make it back to their homes.

That kind of thing
happens a lot.

that simple, but it's not.

That symbol.

00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,208
[MENDOZA]
The time draws near.

321
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:26,833
Once our preparations
are finished,

00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:30,875

Heaven that can stop us.

Tell me, O Golden Knight,

that destroys evil?
