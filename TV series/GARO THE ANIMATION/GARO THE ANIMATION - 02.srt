[NICHOLAS]
My child, you needn't utter

3
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,125
a single word of confession.

4
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:23,125
For those with eyes to see,
the truth is plain as day.

5
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,458
It's clear to me only a fool

6
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:28,000
would levee the charge
of witchcraft against you.

7
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:31,125
Father, I... please.

8
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,291
[WOMAN screams]

9
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:40,000
You are a man of the cloth.
How could you do this, Father?

10
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:47,083
[NICHOLAS] Where the human
heart embraces greed,

11
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,458
wickedness, and depravity,

12
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,875
the Gates of Makai
are thrown wide.

13
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,166
[NICHOLAS yells]

14
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,416
Those consumed by the Horror,
become Horrors themselves,

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,458
in turn seeking to
consume others.

16
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,708
[NICHOLAS]
Such vile, poisonous creatures

17
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:10,875
hath been hunted
since time out of mind.

18
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:14,166
Relentlessly pursued
by Men of the Armor,

19
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,791
the Makai Knights!

20
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,500
[GARM sniffs]
That smell.

21
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:08,208
The elusive Zoro returns.
How long it has been.

22
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,750
[GERMÁN] A Watchdog
betrayed by his own scent.

23
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,416
Your nose is as sharp as ever.

24
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,333
Oh, my, and your
wardrobe as childish.

25
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,541
I can don my true form,
if that is what you prefer.

26
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:23,250
[GERMÁN] No! I wouldn't
dream of troubling you.

27
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,083
Quite. Then you may address
me at leisure, knight.

28
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:29,458
I cannot even remember the
last time I gave an audience.

29
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,000
The company of your
kind has ebbed of late.

30
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:35,875
In all my years, this is
the loneliest I've been here.

31
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,666
The witch hunts of Valiante.

32
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,875
Listen, there's no point
beating around the bush.

33
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,791
Such a tragedy.

34
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:46,875
Your acting is deplorable.
Casualties are a tragedy,

35
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,666
but it was your kind's orders
that sent so many of my brethren

36
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,041
to their doom.

37
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,125
Do you deny it?

38
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,375
The dispatches were forged.

39
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,875
Your brethren died for
want of perception.

40
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,041
[GERMÁN] The writ I received
looked genuine enough.

41
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,666
[GARM]
Because you are blind!

42
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,583
All dispatches from the
Watchdog Center were suppressed.

43
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,416
Any you received
were counterfeit,

44
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,875
meant to lead you astray.

45
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:10,708
A bold move that only one man
had the means to make.

46
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,625
Mendoza.

47
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,458
[GARM]
Precisely.

48
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,166
The Makai Alchemist we once
so staunchly supported.

49
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,291
The gambit would have
been child's play for him.

50
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,083
[MENDOZA]
What? Impossible.

51
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,541
Are you absolutely certain?

52
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,500
Yes. My eyes
did not deceive me, sir.

53
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,375
The queen herself
gifted it to the prince

54
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,333
in honor of his birthday.

55
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,750
How can such a thing be true?

56
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,500
The blood of the Makai
beneath my nose, and I,

57
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,416
foolish sod that I am,
stood by completely oblivious?

58
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,125
[OCTAVIA]
Master Mendoza!

59
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,250
Get away!

60
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,625
I-I didn't mean to
touch you, sir. I...

61
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:53,250
[groaning] Their blood,

62
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,375
their blood is an aberration.

63
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,541
I must expunge every last drop!

64
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,791
[GERMÁN] Mendoza's hatred
for our order is fathomless.

65
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,250
Why does he hold such venom

66
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,250
for those he was once
in league with?

67
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,291
Whatever you did
to spark his ire,

68
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,208
I'll bet he had it coming.

69
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,125

00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,083
[GERMÁN] ] Are all the rumors
floating around true,

71
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,083
that he commands the Horrors?

72
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,166
I rifled through
the Council archives,

73
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,958
but alas, someone's made off
with all the relevant documents.

74
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,541
Care to explain?

75
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,125
[sighs]

76
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,625
Come now.

77
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,166
[GARM] Horrors descend upon
Valiante and its capitol,

78
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,000
Sahnta Bard, in great numbers.
Eliminate the threat.

79
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,166
We will see to it that Mendoza
reaps what he has sown.

80
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,458
Makai Knight, this charge
is your sacred duty.

81
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,250
[GERMÁN] The world has precious
little need of us anymore,

82
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:45,416
but it's comforting to know
that some things never change.

83
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,166
[GARM] Zoro,
what of your son?

84
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,583
I trust the Golden Armor
rests easy upon him?

[grunts]

95
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,625
[GERMÁN] Thought you
could use a dip.

[LEÓN sighs]

97
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,625
[GERMÁN] Whenever you're done
down there, we should go.

98
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,625
[LEÓN] Sure you don't want
to take a dip first?

99
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,500
[GERMÁN]
Nah, maybe later.

100
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,583
[GERMÁN]
For the love of God, Leon.

101
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,000
[LEÓN]
What?

102
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,833
Your face is so grim.
Would it kill you to smile?

103
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:55,083
Kill me? Not exactly,
but it wouldn't be natural.

104
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,541
This is the face I was
born with, you know that.

105
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,250
[GERMÁN]
Boy, please!

106
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:02,250
Ladies require a more
inviting expression.

107
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,458
[LEÓN] Good. Then they'll
keep their distance.

108
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,666
[GERMÁN] Huh??
That's the opposite of good.

109
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,083
Do you want the fire markings
to keep coming back?

110
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,208
Uh? What's that to do with it?

111
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:14,083
It's time to grow up and
be more like dear ol' Dad.

112
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:17,000
Submit to the charms of the
fairer sex and those markings--

113

Oh! Ha, ha, ha.

114
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,958
Shut up! You are disrespecting
my mother talking like that,

115
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,250
and I won't allow it!

116
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,875

Very well done,

Thank you.

Though I can't help but feel
he went easy on me.

Whether he did or not,
Your Highness,

127

it's poor form of
you to suggest it.

128

Uh? Quite right.
I apologize.

[SOLDIER]
Cretin!

Royal Emblem to pieces!

Forgive me! It was an accident,

[SOLDIER] Your Highness,
what are you doing?

139

[ALFONSO] An emblem can
be repaired, can it not?

140
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:17,416
It is but an object, or would
you have me whipped as well?

141

[SOLDIER]
Of course not! The very idea.

142

[MENDOZA] That I am.
Forgive the outrage, my liege,

160
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,875
I had no choice. It has recently
come to my attention

161
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,791
that the root of your august
person's decline is poison.

162
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:16,875
[ESMERALDA]
What?!

163
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,083
[MENDOZA]
Yes, the wine administered

164
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,208
at the royal table
has been tainted,

165
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,791
as is the very elixir
your wife would have us believe

166
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,500
carries the power
to restore you!

167
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:25,666
[ESMERALDA]
It can't be!

168
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,208
[shattering sound]

169
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,791
[MENDOZA] This questionable
physic was concocted by you,

170
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,125
my queen. Is that not so?

171
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:35,166
[gasps] What are
you insinuating?

172
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,000
High treason. A base act
of treachery executed

173
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,416
by you against your royal
husband and master!

174
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,708
This is outrageous! Why would
I poison the man that I love?

175
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,916
What could I possibly
stand to gain by it?

176
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,125
Enough, your lie is found out;
your stake is Alfonso.

177
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,625
After all, what is a decrepit
husband to a son on the throne?

178
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,958
You speak nonsense!

179
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,500
Is his Majesty
really the father?

180
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:04,208
[ESMERALDA] How dare you.
How can you ask such a thing?

181
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,625
Mark me, basilisk,
I won't forgive this!

182
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,375
Hey, hey! Not a bad bargain,
if you ask me.

183
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,458
What possessed you
to sell them?

184
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,333
Are we to make the
rest of our way on foot?

185
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,166
Battle cannot be
waged without coin,

186
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,583
or stealth. Horses are
too conspicuous.

187
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,291
So we're at war?

188
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,666
You're such a cad! You know
I can't stand to be bored!

189
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,875
For heaven's sake, Mani,
give Lydia a kiss!

190
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,750
[LYDIA]
Let's find a nice, quiet place

191
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,875
to divert ourselves for a while.

192
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,833
Listen up, son. There's
something you need to know.

193
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,166
You inherited your armor
from your mother, granted,

194
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,041
which means you're the only one
who can summon it.

195
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,333
I know.

196
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,916
Trouble is, who then inherits
your father's armor?

197
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,500
See, that's a problem. My legacy
still waits for an heir.

198
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,583
Therefore, I need to breed.

199
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:04,500
I need another son to
groom as the Zoro knight.

200
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,666
Son of a bitch.

201
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,916
[grunts]
Fine!

202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,833
Uh?!

203
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,208
[GERMÁN]
Glad you understand!

204
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,375
Incidentally, you're on your
own for dinner tonight.

205
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,083
[LEÓN growls] You are the
worst father imaginable!

206
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:18,083
I hope your armor
rusts, jackass!

207
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,041
Bastard. What could my mother
have possibly seen in him?

208
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:38,500
[MAN] Lit only yesterday,
the embers are still warm.

209
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,291
Young maidens have been
disappearing left and right.

210
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,750
The work of a witch, people say.

211
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:47,791
And so, the hunt has
escalated most terribly.

212
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,333
[chuckles]

213
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:53,375
Authorities just took another
poor wench from the outside.

214
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,333
Perhaps when she burns,
these horrors will end.

215
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,791
[chuckles]

216
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,291
[MAN]
Good of you to come, Father.

217
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,625
We've been waiting.

218
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,541
Well done. Another witch
captured is a boon to all.

219
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,666
[MAN] Yes, sir. The wanton slut
maintains she's but a traveler.

220
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,375
However, several
witnesses reported

221
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:22,000
seeing her heal the carpenter's
daughter with strange magic.

222
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,500
What is your name?

223
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:28,458
[MAN] The Priest is
speaking to you, answer!

224
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,458
My name? Ema.

225
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,958
You smile, my child.

226
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,708
Can it be you fail to grasp
the weight of the charges

227
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:35,916
levied against you?

228
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,333
Witches are tortured
and burned at the stake.

229
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:41,250
Of course, those who confess
early are spared the rack,

230
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,875
and their pyres arranged so that
death is quick and painless.

231
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,250
I see, a lingering demise
versus one that comes quick.

232
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,708
What a fine choice.

233
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,875
Do you not see?
She is insolent!

234
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,416
Let us torture the wicked
creature and be done with it.

235
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,833
[NICHOLAS] Mm. Do not
be so quick to condemn.

236
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:01,875
Let us give her the night.
Perhaps she will reconsider.

237
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,333
Perhaps.

238
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,000
Hear that?

239
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,500
Just be grateful you found
Father Nicholas

240
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,625
in a merciful vein!

241
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,625
I'd thank the man,
except he's not my type.

242
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,125
Hold your tongue, serpent!

243
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,833
[groans]

244
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:19,041
[screaming]

245
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,750
[gasps] Let go! Let go!

246
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,125
[thuds]

247
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,458
Maybe I'm hard of hearing,

248
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,750
but weren't you told
to wait till tomorrow?

249
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,458
[BOTH whimper] Yes ma'am.

250
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,750
What a catch.

251
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:41,708
[bell rings]

252
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:45,791
[LEÓN] Women are disappearing.
I smell a Horror.

253
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,291
Yes, I agree.

254
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,083
This situation reeks
of the enemy,

255
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,041
but the new girl
is an alchemist.

256
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,666
And how can you know that?

257
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,666
[GERMÁN laughs] Your old man
wasn't just frolicking 'tween

258
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,666
the sheets all day.
How I know's not important.

259
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,666
If this woman is an Alchemist,
she could be an invaluable ally.

260
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,666
I think an alchemist
worth her salt

261
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,708
wouldn't've been captured
in the first place.

262
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,458
What could she have done
against normal human beings?

263
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,083
Those of Makai blood are not
permitted to harm people,

264
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,916
regardless of circumstances.

265
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,500
[LEÓN] Yeah, yeah.
We have to protect them.

266
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,541
[GERMÁN]
Never forget it.

267
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:54,000
Ah. Hello, your Grace.
How goes it?

268
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,708
Fine, Miss Ema, and you?

269
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,458
Bit late for a priest to be up,
don't you think, love?

270
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,875
I was hoping to divert myself
with conversation,

271
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,708
if you're amenable.

272
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,000
Don't worry,
you needn't utter a word.

273
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:09,166
Your body and I
shall do the talking!

274
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,625
Truly, I'm not
worthy of the honor.

275
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:17,000
Ha, ha, ha. Shall I tell
you a secret?

276
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,583
A witch's flesh
is full of mystery.

277
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,166
Somewhere on her body is
a place which knows no pain,

278
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,875
even when pierced
with a needle.

279
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,166
During interrogation,
every inch of her is

280
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,375
plumbed and prodded, until
that special place is found.

281
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,958
Delicious acreages of skin,
pricked over and over and over.

282
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,333
Don't you know an old
wives' tale when you hear it?

283
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,333
Superstitions often mask
an underlying truth.

284
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,750
Perhaps the fabled spot
is merely the witch's body

285
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,500
retreating to merciful
numbness, or worse,

286
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,625
perhaps her threshold for pain
can be overwhelmed to a point

287
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,875
at which 'tis no longer
possible to shriek or weep,

288
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,791
though the agony surges on.

289
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,416
Let us now discover
your threshold!

290
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,875
Be my guest.

291
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,041
[gasps]

292
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,625
As I suspected.

293
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,208
What does that mean?

294
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:07,083
I breeze into town and ferret
out a Horror almost immediately.

295
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,166
[gasps] Oh, I see.

296
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,958
I take it you're
a Makai Alchemist?

297
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,541
Tell me something,
you wretch,

298
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,083
does the name Luciano
mean anything to you?

299
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,291
Alas, not a twinge
of recollection.

300
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,666
Right. Okay, then.

301
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,375
Never mind, forget
I brought it up.

302
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,625
Quite.

303
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,416
My dear girl, even if
you are an alchemist.

304
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,708
there exist a variety
of ways to enjoy you!

305
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,125
Oh, yes! Come, my
petulant little vixen!

306
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,583
Let me hear the sound your
kind makes under the blade!

307
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,041
[chuckles]

308
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,333
[door opens]

309
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,250
[LEÓN]
A Horror!

310
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,958
León, this one's
all yours, son!

311
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:45,541
[HORROR NICHOLAS roars]

312
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,833
[LEÓN panting]

313
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,250
Are you all right?

314
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,250
We made it just in time.
Allow me to introduce myself,

315
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,250

00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,666
Charmed, Ger.

317
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,041
Thank you, but your
help was not needed.

Uh? Uh. Okay.

What?

321
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,375
Move it, chico,
you're in the way!

322
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:24,708
Excuse me? You're the

León!

My, my. What's his story?

00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:43,083
I'd say the firebrand is lucky
his power didn't eat him alive.

360
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:46,083
I've seen some pathetic
Knights in my time, but this?

My lady, if you only knew. He's
still "mastering" his abilities.

[chuckles] What about you?
Are you hurt?

Of course not.

364
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:57,541
I see the Makai Knights
are as presumptuous as ever.

far away from here as possible!

What's happened? Tell me!

It's not safe! They'll come
for you in a trice!

376
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,583
Mendosa has betrayed our trust!

377
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,708
Then he will pay!

and return to liberate us as
the Golden Knight did long ago!

[grunts] As you wish.

son from the reach of harm.

385
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,666
an infestation,

slinking like rats into every
crevice, fouling all they touch!

387
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:27,833
[ALFONSO] Mother, father,
I will return, I swear it!

388
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:31,125
God be with you until that day.

389
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:07,541
[GARM] The sharpened fang
is a double-edged sword.

390
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:10,625
A naked blade with no scabbard.
