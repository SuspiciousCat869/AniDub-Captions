[MENDOZA]
Ages ago,

6
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,916
our forebears the Knights
and Alchemists who founded

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,166
the once thriving network
of Watchdog Centers,

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,541
sealed a certain demon
within this cave.

9
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:35,083
[GERMÁN gasps]
My God.

10
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:38,666
[MENDOZA] The great demon,
Anima, will be resurrected.

11
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,791
It will waken and engorge
itself on the Horrors

12
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,416
pouring through the Makai Gates.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,166
And when its power is
bridled to my will...

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,625
the secret of immortality
will be mine.

15
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,583
[LEÓN]
Old man.

16
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,583
[JIRUBA] Quickly now.
Germán is waiting for you.

17
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,791
[ALFONSO] León, are you
certain you're all right?

18
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:33,541
Yes. Try not to worry.

19
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,250
Come on.

20
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,583
[JIRUBA] You must hurry.
Germán is waiting.

21
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,958
[LEÓN]
After all that? Really?

22
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,125
[JIRUBA]
His actions were a ruse.

23
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:52,541
Mendoza must work without
obstruction. Anima must awaken.

24
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:55,750
He intends to let the beast
rise to fight it head on.

25
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,750
Earning Mendoza's trust was
a tactic all along.

26
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:01,583
He's a sly old fox, you have
to give him that much.

27
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:06,208
[JIRUBA] "I shall clear the way
for all of you. Please, hurry."

28
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:10,083
That is your father's message.
Hear, and heed well.

29
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,333
Now, I retire to silence.

30
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:16,458
The toil of words
I leave behind.

31
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,250
Reckless old scoundrel.

32
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,958
Exactly the sort of
thing he'd pull.

33
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,750
[EMA] The moon is on
the wane, gentlemen.

34
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:35,458
There's a certain thrill in this
if one has the heart for it.

35
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:39,541
Ah. Never mind. Just try not
the spoil the mood by dying.

36
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,583
But of course. Now
courage, friends.

37
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,416
For the good of Valiante!

38
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,125
Indeed.

39
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,458
This time without fail.

40
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:36,208
[GHOSTLY VOICES scream]

42
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:52,625
Are they... Makai?!

43
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,041
They're knights,
and alchemists!

44
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,583
[MENDOZA] Quite a few.
Drawing out Anima's power

45
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,375
requires proportional sacrifice.

46
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,625
Monstrous, even for you.

47
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,250
In ancient times, normal
humans would suffice.

48
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:08,625
As a summoning medium
they were easily accessible.

49
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,708
The Council believes I harvest
my offerings from the general

50
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:15,625
population, but, as in much
else, they are wrong.

51
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,708
The witch hunts were not
chiefly an effort to chip away

52
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,375
at your brothers and
sisters, my friend.

53
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:25,416
For this ritual, I needed
souls of a special caliber.

54
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,166
Come, Knight. You must
admit, t'was quite clever.

55
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,666
And we were convinced you'd
burned those men and women

56
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,916
to quell the fires
of your own hatred.

57
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,750
Oh, I take great satisfaction
searing the Council

58
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,541
with its own idiocy.

59
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,500
Ha! If you have the chance.

60
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,833
Garm, whatever else may be
said of her, is not dense.

61
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:48,333
She's far too sly to engage in
a battle she knows is lost.

62
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:51,333
At the end of the day, the
Watchdog Center's Oracle

63
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,750
is prepared to destroy
this whole land.

64
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,666
You may wager she did
not come to that lightly.

65
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,333
She is a formidable tactician.
As oracles go, her decisions

66
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:03,833
display a modicum of what
might be called good sense.

67
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:07,333
Yet, for all the warp and
weft of her stratagems,

68
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,583
many details slip past.

69
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:13,125
Yes, All just as well,
honestly speaking.

70
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:17,833
As I intend to foil her
plan, and cut you down.

71
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,708
That is my hope, at any rate.

72

What a quandary!

76
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,208
Does the gallant Zoro become the
dog that turns on its master?

77
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,291
Well, I'm not sworn to protect
their interests, am I?

78
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:39,166
Nor yours either. I'm in the
business of protecting lives.

79
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,875
[MENDOZA] Mm. You disappoint me,
Germán Luís. I expected better.

80

I've not fallen far enough
for you to expect

81

anything of me save enmity.

Bound by your duty to protect.

But naïveté is a darkness.

[GERMÁN] Heh. I'll just
leave this here for now.

161
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,625
Can't have you closing on us.

What a glorious sound.

168
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:33,750
[MENDOZA] My bitterness softens
with each anguished scream.

169
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:43,416
Mendoza was clearly equipped
for our infiltration in advance.

170
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,333
I fear this augurs rather
poorly for uncle's charade.

171
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:49,500
That jackass couldn't even last
long enough for us to reach him.

172
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,291
The man put Mendoza off
his guard the best he could.

[EMA] Ha! Got 'em!
Right, here's the plan.

175
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,708
Destroy the objects at the
ends of these threads.

176
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:10,791
No time to lose!

We're coming, old man.

Hold on just a bit longer.

I'm still kicking!

191
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:37,250
Ha. I'd love to oblige you.
Regrettably, I've never been

192
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:40,541
the sort of fellow who's
had the good sense to die!

Don't patronize me.
Now, come on.

199
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,083
We haven't the luxury
to slow down.

200

[EMA gasps]
What?!

201
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,791
What is this?

202
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:38,041
Someone's notion of a joke that
isn't remotely humorous.

203
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:45,083
[ALFONSO] Impossible. This may
well take ages to break through.

204
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,666
Then we've no choice
but to use force.

205
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,250
Spoken like an imbecile!

206
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,083
Damn it, there's
no other option!

207
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,958
Do you know how
powerful this is?

208
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,750
Think strategically for once.
If you could break though,

209
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,708
you'd be in no shape
to fight afterwards!

210
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,583
My old man is waiting for me.

can to get to him,

00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,208
he'll piss and moan for days.

214

Well, we can't abide that.

215
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,333
Very well. We'll take
turns with the barrier.

216

All right.

217
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,875
Great. That's settled.
Now get to it!

Master, allow me to annihilate
them on your behalf.

My child, you haven't the power.

But, sir! I beg you to
witness my devotion!

Please. Lend me the
power to smite them.

I will not disappoint!
I would see the world

228

your genius has conceived
at last come to pass.

229
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,166
Master Mendoza, I long for
the honor to contribute!

230
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:11,750
I care not the cost! I will
destroy the Makai Knights!

true, take up the staff.
