1
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,416
[MENDOZA] It seems the creation
of our knights continues apace.

2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,500
[JORDI]
Armor dark as the abyss.

3
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,500
Cut a dire figure, he did.

4
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:24,083
Folks took to calling
him the Black Knight.

5
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,458
[BERNARDO]
The choreography of his blade.

6
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:30,375
I know it from a lifetime ago.

7
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:33,041
[BERNARDO chuckles]
Of course.

8
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,666
[GERMÁN humming]

9
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,041
[LEÓN]
Hey.

10
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:42,416
When are we going to
storm the castle already?

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,041
C'mon! There's no point
in being hasty!

12
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,250
We still don't know
what we're up against.

13
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:50,833
For now, we wait for the ladies
to dig up more information.

14
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:53,791
God forbid you ask beyond
the walls of the brothel!

15
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:56,375
[chuckles] Horrors
tend to manifest

16
00:00:56,458 --> 00:01:00,875
where passions run highest.
It's a dirty job, but, ha.

17
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:01,875
Really?

18
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,875
Then what's with
the fancy mirror?

19
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,750
Is it part of your arsenal?

20
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:10,333
So to speak.

21
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:13,041
There's not a woman alive
who'd spurn a gift.

22
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,250
It renders them zealous.

23
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,166
Fatherly wisdom!

24
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,958
You'll understand when
you're older, son.

25
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,333
[LEÓN]
You jackass!

26
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,541
Are you ever not thinking
with your codpiece?

27
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:30,000
[GERMÁN groans]

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,875
And that is how your
most lovely gift

29
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,291
met its sad demise.

30
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:36,250
A tragic tale to be sure,

31
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,458
but not half as tragic
as this son of yours.

32
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,375
No, no, no, no, no.

33
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:41,958
That's enough about him.

34
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,875
Though I do know another
little boy of mine

35
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,833
that understands
your special gift.

36
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:47,250
Quite enough!

37
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,333
--You cheeky rogue.
--[rattling]

38
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:51,541
[SOLDIER 8A]
Circle 'round! He was wounded!

39
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,750
He won't get far like that!

40
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,750
What the hell's
going on out there?

41
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,125
I wonder who they're
chasing down this time.

42
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,250
The soldiers always seem
to be after some witch.

43
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,833
[GERMÁN]
Hm...

44
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:04,333
[PROSTITUTE 8A] Maybe one day
they'll hunt girls like me.

45
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,125
Name me a witch who deceives men

46
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,416
with her pretty words
and her soft kisses.

47
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,166
I wonder if I would survive it.

48
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,791
They'll have to send eunuchs
to capture you, my dear.

49
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,041
Flattery earns you no extra.

50
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,208
But I must say there is
something oddly appealing

51
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:20,250
about a man in armor.
Bound up so tight.

52
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,541
Maybe so, but, dear heart,
all of my best battles

53
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,083
were fought completely naked!

54
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:29,666
[PROSTITUTE 8A laughs] Naughty
boy! I'll show you a battle!

55
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,166
[GERMÁN]
However will I take victory?

56
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,041
I've a sharp sword but no armor!

57
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,250
[RAFAEL] Where the human
heart embraces evil,

58
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:41,291
Horrors feast, possessing
those who invite them.

59
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,375
Such vile, poisonous
creatures have been hunted

60
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,791
since time out of mind,
relentlessly pursued

61
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:51,791
by Men of the Armor.
The Makai Knights!

62
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:35,625
[GERMÁN yawns]

63
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,541
Ew... I'll never hear
the end of it from León

64
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:42,541
if I show up like this.
Better avoid him.

65
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:47,375
Huh?

00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:54,083
[IRENE panting]

[IRENE yelps]

68
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,708
Running awfully quick,
wouldn't you say?

69
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,458
Please, help! I beg of you!
Don't let them take me!

70
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:00,416
Huh?

71
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,666
[CAPI cackles]
There you are!

72
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,500
[BIGAS]
No chance you're gonna escape!

73

[IRENE whimpers]

74
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,125
[GERMÁN]
Hm?

75
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,333
Hey, pink shirt!

76
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,458
Why don't you send
that waif our way?

77
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,500
No, I don't think so.

78
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,791
I'm pretty sure she'd
rather stay with me.

79
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,625
Give up the girl
and you can still

80
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,208
walk away clean from all this.

81
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,500
I see. However will we get by?

82
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,625
This guy's just tryin'
to piss us off!

83
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,000
Come on, Donato.

84
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,375
Why don't we slit his
smartass cavalier throat!

85
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,666
I am growing tired of
his chivalrous hero act.

86
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,500
I think you have the
right idea there, Capi.

87
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,666
[GERMÁN]
Mm-hm...

[BIGAS, DONATO, CAPI gasp]

90
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,958
[GERMÁN laughs]
I see now!

91
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,125
Discretion is the
better part of valor!

92
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,625
[BIGAS]
Get back here with that girl!

93
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,666
[CAPI]
You can't outrun us, bastard!

94
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,000
[BIGAS]
We'll get you!

95
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,041
Now, what's your
name, young lady?

96
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,833
It's Irene, my good sir!

97
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:11,083
Irene, a name fit for an angel.
Tell me, are they behind us?

98
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,458
Not that I can tell.

99
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,791
Aha. But what if they return?

100
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:19,250
Well, we should hide ourselves.
I know of a place nearby.

101
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:27,166
[IRENE] We'll be safe here,
I'm positive. No one uses it.

102
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,541
[GERMÁN]
Very sly.

103
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:32,041
Let's get comfortable while
they tire of the chase.

104
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,750
[IRENE] I can't believe
you'd risk your life

105
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,166
to save a stranger.

106
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,083
[GERMÁN] What can you tell
me about those brigands?

107
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,125
Well, a few nights ago
they were getting rowdy

108
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,583
in a tavern. The big one
tried to grab me,

109
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,750
so I hit him with
a bottle and fled.

110
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,333
They didn't chase after me then,
which I thought was strange,

111
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,583
but when I was walking today,

112
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,958
I ran into them on
the street and, well...

113
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,583
I suppose you had
no bottles on hand.

114
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,375
No. How can I
thank you, good sir?

115
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,125
Worry not.

116
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,083
[IRENE]
Please, I must!

117
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,625
I guess that a kiss
would suffice.

118
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,333
Huh? Uh...

119
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,208
That was quick.

120
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:10,458
I guess I should have asked
for a greater reward then.

121
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:14,500
Silly. No one said
that's off the table.

122
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,875
No, no. I wasn't-- Wait, what?

123
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:20,166
Let's be honest.
You saved my life.

124
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,250
You would be gentle,
wouldn't you?

125
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,208
Uh...

126
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,416
[laughs]

127
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,541
Very well! If you desire,

128
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,875
I, Germán, shall storm
the castle of thy love!

[gasps]

130
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,125
By this heart.

131
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,416
I swear to treat you with
passion and tenderness.

132
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,250
Sir, I...

133
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,416
Be gentle.

134
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,041
Come. Let me lead.

135
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:43,708
[BIGAS grunts]

136
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:44,541

[IRENE gasps]

138
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,750
Somebody tell me why the
hell he's naked in here!

139
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,375
Quick! Irene!

140
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,666
We have... to get out
of here right away.

141
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,958
Wait. You seem very calm.

142
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,291
[chuckles] Thanks for
the coinpurse!

143
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,791
No! But...

144
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:02,125
I was moments away from storming
the castle of thy love!

145
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,416
You mean you really believed
that whole virgin maiden act?

146
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,750
[GERMÁN]
Yeah.

147
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,666
Well, Donato, when you're
right, you are right.

148
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,583
Eh. Anyone with eyes can see
the man's desperate for it.

149
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,583
[GERMÁN] It seems that
I have been beaten.

150
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,166
I will accept my loss.

151
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,625
But, please, if you have any
honor at all, take the money,

152
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,541
yet leave the clothes behind.

153
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,208
[IRENE chuckles]

154
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,583
You just pluck my heartstrings

155
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,458
Ain't no fun to be
had in your version.

156
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:32,000
[CAPI] Who are you to rob us
of some entertainment, huh?

157
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,833
[sighs] Well, Irene...

158
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,333
Got somethin' to say?

159
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,375
We could've had

[LADY 8A] With all of that

I couldn't get a wink of sleep.

Did you hear if the
guard caught them yet?

I heard it was a man
and some kind of witch!

Plenty of soldiers out
today, that's for sure.

But it seemed like you
were having such fun.

Your definition of fun is
a very broad one, indeed.

My word.

Your son almost dies last
night and I find you naked.

Oh? What happened to him?

259
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,791
He fought the Black Knight.

260
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,000
León was no match
for one such as him.

261
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,875
The Black Knight?

262
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,583
Yes. His name is Bernardo Dion.

Where's León?

He managed to escape,
although not by much.

00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,500
I'd have followed,
but the guard was after me.

[sighs]

269

What, not rushing to his side?

270
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,583
It's enough that León is alive.

I only hope that he
can take this defeat

as something to learn from.
The day draws near.

I pray my son will discover
what he lacks in time.

It is the sworn duty
of you Makai Knights

to defend and protect.

If the boy only
seeks to gain power

277
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,041
out of his desire for revenge...

278
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,375
He may never be worthy
of the Golden Armor.

279

rescue. As for him...

is what needs doing.

U-Uh-- Ahem.
Bernardo still lives,

288

and yet you said nothing.

289
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,000
It wouldn't change your
hunt for Mendooza,

290
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,458
now would it?

291
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,208
I simply neglected to tell
you he was likely to appear.

292
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,500
It seemed rather
irrelevant information.

293
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:25,666
It's about time I tell you this.
You can sometimes annoy.

294
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,333
[GARM] You wound me,
sweet Zoro. Don't you see?

295
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,958
I kept silent to keep
your pretty mortal heart

296
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,875
from quivering and breaking
at the very thought.

297
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,250
The truth. Is he fallen?

298
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,250
He yet lives, drowned
in the shadows.

299
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,541
I do weep for his loss.

300
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:48,083
Tch. We are but dogs
for your purpose.

301
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,833
Come, Anna! Keep up with us!

302
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,625
You can shout back
at me all you want,

303
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,458
but it doesn't mean the horse
will suddenly do what I say!

304
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,875
Too bad about Anna.

305
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,833
Her hands spur neither
horses nor men to action.

306
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,333
That's quite uncouth.

307
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,500
No, this is uncouth.

308
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,625
If you catch me, Anna,
you can have me!

309
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,208
God, you're such a letch.

Ow. Ow, ow, ow.

Are you all right, Anna?

315
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,625
Uh, yes. Think so.

316
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,333
[GERMÁN]
Truly an astounding dismount.

Thank God you're unharmed.

318
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,333
Or perhaps you just owe it all
to your "natural cushioning"?

319
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,291
[ANNA] Your cushioning's
all in your skull.

Here. Hop up.

321
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,000
[ANNA]
Fine.

322
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:41,916
Thank you.

323
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:52,833
[GERMÁN, BERNARDO grunting]

324
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:53,916
One of these days,

325
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,708
I'd like to take you on
in a true fight!

326
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,125
Just say the word, then.

327
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:01,250
You know that we can't!
Our code forbids us such duels.

328
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,958
You never were one to
break the rules, were ya?

329
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,875
[BERNARDO]
Hm? I wish that I could.

330
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:07,875
Huh?

331
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,666
Many's the time my
soul has cried out

332
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,291
for me to spurn
our oath altogether.

333
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,333
In a voice loud as thunder.

334
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,375
Truly?

335
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,458
[BERNARDO grunts]

336
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,416
Well! That was creative.

337
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,416
[BERNARDO] Hmph. That was
a victory, friend.

338
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,208
[GERMÁN]
Victory? Anna!

339
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,833
Can you believe this cheater?
He's still counting it!

340
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,541
Better keep your eye on him!

341
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,916
[ANNA giggles]

342
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,041
[SOLDIER 8L] The witch!
They're fleeing with her!

343
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,000
[SOLDIER 8K]
After them! Quick!

344
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,250
[SOLDIER 8M]
Hurry, men!

345
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,833
[GERMÁN grunts, groans]

346
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,291
Roberto!

347
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,916
[GERMÁN]
Anna! Are you all right?

348
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,666
[ANNA]
Ah. Yes. We are.

349
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,666
[gasps]

350
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,666
[BERNARDO]
Roberto! We must fly!

351
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,791
You're right. Let's go, then.

352
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,916
[gasps]

353
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,416
[GERMÁN] Just a nick.
Here, you should take Anna.

354
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,666
Quickly, now. Both of
you mount up.

355
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,541
I can lead them down
another street.

356
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:13,750
[GERMÁN]
Are you an idiot?

357
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:14,958
You know that I'm
the better swords--

358
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,291
Listen to me!

359
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:19,416
You haven't much chance
with one arm running red!

360
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,750
What're you gonna do?

361
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,458
You damn well can't fight
them all on your own.

362
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,750
I'll find a way.

363
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,375
This, is our only
option, my friend.

364

[GERMÁN grunts]

365
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,125
You think you can ride?

366
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,666
I think so.

367
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:37,583
[hooves clacking]

368
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:38,833
Now go!

369
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:39,583
Fight well.

370
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,333
We will find you!

371
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,291
Ride hard.

372
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,458
Thank me when next we meet.

[BERNARDO]
Forgive me, Roberto.

378
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,916
As of tonight, I wear the
armor of righteousness,

379
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,541
no longer.

380

[BERNARDO]
Face me, Roberto.

381
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,000
[GERMÁN sneezes]

382
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:46,333
Bernardo's alive. He'll come.

383
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,333
And I can do naught
but brace myself.

384
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:58,416
Just my luck.

385
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,791
My clothes are
nowhere to be found.

386
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,625
It's that kinda day.

Oh, now what?

[gasps] Not you again!

Good sir. Thank
heavens it's you!

Huh? You can spare me the tears.

392
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,166
I have nothing else you
can steal. You took it all!

393
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,791
Look, twice in one day
seems a little ambitious.

394
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:25,791
How about you go ply
your con elsewhere.

[IRENE sobs]

396
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,166
Tell me what happened.

397

I can't even be sure.

398
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,750
But, well,

399
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,916
after you ran away,
Donato got really angry,

400
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,708
worse than I'd ever seen before!

please, believe me!

Please tell me where
I can find my clothes.

[GERMÁN] Continue down
this path, and you, too,

will become a monster.

But, I can be
pretty intimidating.

Is it really?

during the fight.

That you lost to the
