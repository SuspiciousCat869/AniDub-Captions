00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:16,875
[ALFONSO yelling]

2
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:20,833
[FERNANDO]
Forgive me, Alfonso.

3
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:24,625
[ALFONSO] Father, such worry
will hamper your recovery.

4
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,083
[GERMÁN]
Aren't you, curious?

5
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,666
For all you can say, I owe
my condition to the prince.

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,750
Perhaps you're harboring
an evil guest.

7
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,041
Perhaps, but there again:

8
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,833
I am a woman who
counts her blessings

9
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,708
and you did at least have
clothes on this time.

10
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,166
[CHAMBERLAIN]
After the portrait,

11
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,666
today's schedule is as follows:

12
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,916
We have astronomy, then
math, followed by theology.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,750
After which, some thirty-odd
matters of state

14
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,250
require your attention as proxy.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,708
[CHAMBERLAIN] Next is a light
luncheon with Count Delgado.

16
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,875
[ALFONSO sighs, chuckles]

17
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,375
[CHAMBERLAIN]
You've also an audience

18
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:14,666
with the delegate of a church

19
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,333
seeking to enlarge its
charitable endowment.

20
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:19,833
And a brief appearance at
the Consortium of Investiture

21
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:22,875
for the Progeny of
the Noble Class.

22
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,208
[ALFONSO]
Lord Chamberlain.

23
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,625
[CHAMBERLAIN]
Yes?

24
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:27,041
[ALFONSO] The days have
been filled with such errands

25
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:30,458
since my return. Will the
clamor never end?

26
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:31,458
End?

27
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,333
Granted, much ill
has befallen us.

28
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:35,041
And the time
necessary for castle

29
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:37,958
and township to recuperate
cannot be helped, I suppose.

30
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:41,291
Yet, one hopes against hope
this climate of unending strife

31
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,125
will soon yield to normality.

32
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,625
Ah, but I would suggest

33
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:46,916
that for a Prince's itinerary
to be so clamorous,

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,291
strife has yielded to
normality, Your Grace.

35
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,500
Oh, is that so?

36
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,541
Now. If His Highness
would make haste.

37
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:56,791
The royal portrait.

38
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,500
[ALFONSO groans]

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,500
[PAINTER] I am not worthy of
your patience, Your Majesty.

40
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,166
Quite so.

41
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,583
Highness, could you?

42
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:20,916
[yelps]

43
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,166
[PAINTER]
Oh! Oh dear!

44
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,250
What's become of the prince?!

45
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,958
[RAFAEL] Where the human
heart embraces evil,

46
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:33,291
Horrors feast, possessing
those who invite them.

47
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:36,250
Such vile, poisonous
creatures have been hunted

48
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,375
since time out of mind.

49
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,458
Relentlessly pursued
by Men of the Armor.

50
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,083
The Makai Knights!

51
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:25,666
[SOLDIER A]
Well?!

52
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,541
[SOLDIER D]
Nothing!

53
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,583
[SOLDIER B]
That way! Go!

54
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,750
[SOLDIER D]
Sir!

55
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,250
[sighs]

56
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,583
Gracious.

57
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,875
I'm sorry to cause the
sentries so much trouble,

58
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,875
but stealing away to connect
with the common folk

59
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,458
far outweighs the
import of standing

60
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,708
for some frivolous portrait.

61
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,666
And besides, I am
tired beyond words.

62
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,583
[MAN] You gudgeons slink
from Laviestlá, do you not?

63
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,333
Um, yes.

64
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,791
Gaspard Montess at your service.

65
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,166
Assuming you love your life,

66
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,041
decamp from this
carriage and fly.

67
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,875
Ga-Gaspard?!

68
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,166
Ah!

69
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,125
--Have mercy, I beg of you!
--[MEN laughing]

[ALFONSO]

71
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,458
Ha, ha. Convey our
spoils to the castle.

72
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,916
Yes, right away, sir.

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,416
How 'bout that.

[whimpering]

76
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,291
[ALFONSO]
Gaspard.

77
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:42,833
I've heard that name
before... recently.

78
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:46,166
[CHAMBERLAIN] Your Highness,
this man hails from Laviestlá.

79
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,791
He implores your help
in warding off bandits.

80
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,250
Go on.

81
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,958
Your Grace, a band of ruffians

82
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,833
has lately taken up residence
in a nearby castle.

83
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,583
They've laid siege to and
robbed every merchant carriage

84
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,083
that passes through our town.

85
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,625
Their lair is just
outside Laviestlá?

86
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:03,875
A castle once lived in

87
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,416
by the renowned Count
Juste himself, no less.

88
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,416
Surely you don't mean
the Count Juste

89
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,916
from the stories every
boy knows by heart?

90
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,708
I do.

91
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,333
There's not a soul
in all the kingdom

92
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,291
who fails to delight at
tales of the man's valor.

93
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,458
While he fought wars
in heathen lands,

94
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,250
a wife of surpassing beauty
mourned his absence.

95
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,875
He is said, in all his days,

96
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,250
never to have been
bested by another man.

97
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:29,291
Aye, but he laid down
his sword for one peer.

98
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,625
His equal in might and valor:
arch-rival, Lord Roland.

99
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,833
Ah, Count Juste and
Lord Roland, indeed.

100
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,000
I read the stories
when I was a boy.

101
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,416
Their rivalry was
the stuff of legend.

102
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,791
The two men fought for and gave
their love to the same muse:

103
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:48,458
The Count's incomparable
wife, Lady Isabelle.

104
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,041
She planted white lilies
in her husband's absence,

105
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,000
awaiting his safe return.

106
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,583
The blooms were said to
have flourished year round,

107
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,958
sustained by her love.

108
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,833
You may know the story, but
aspects of it are occult to all

109
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,916
but those of us native to
the area, Your Highness.

110

--What are you implying?
--[bell tolls]

111

more about the bandits!

114
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,750
Their leader's name is Gaspard!

115
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,666
Gaspard Montes!

116
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,166

And here he is, it would seem.

with the bristle end
of her broom.

Yes.

00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,000
Honestly, I'm starting to wonder

133
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:04,083
how long I can keep up
this sort of life.

134

such a pleasant
future for yourself.

How is Santa Bard doing?
Have they recovered yet?

Oh, I'd say they're more
or less back to normal.

Alfonso is well-suited
for the role of protector.

The lengths he's gone to
helping the city rebuild

[MINION A yelps]

163
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,250
Surrender, thieves! At once!

164
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,208
Damn.

165
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,916
[MINION C]
Skewer the li'l fop!

166
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,541
[gasps]

167
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,916
[GASPARD yelling]

168
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,875
You're a quick little
brat, aren't you?

169
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,625
You're not bad.

170
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,791
[GERMÁN]
By the flaming moons of hell!

171
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,083
Can't a man get some sleep?

172
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,958
Señor Germán! Save my father!

173
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,000
Fana, please, I've said,

174
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,500
my blade's edge will never be
turned on humans, period.

175
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:55,416
[GERMÁN gasps]

176
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,875
Wait, uncle?

177
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,000
[GASPARD grunts]

178
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,916
[GASPARD laughing]

179
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,333
[GASPARD] To think he's
your nephew, Señor Germán.

180
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,208
Now that is rich.

181
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,375
Accounts for his skills, though.

182
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:12,125
Damn those beetle-scuts
from Laviestlá.

183
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,791
Spreading rumors far and wide

184
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:17,041
that we're but a band of
landlocked privateers.

185
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,500
I take it that is not the case.

186
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:23,208
No. This is a bonafide personal
vendetta. A blood feud!

187
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,875
And let me tell you,
Your Highness,

188
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,041
they're the jackanapes
who started this confrontation

189
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,625
in the first place.

190
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,583
That li'l piss-ant there had the
brass to disrespect my daughter.

191
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,208
No, I didn't! I swear!

192
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,625
You're overstating it, Daddy.

193
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,375
All the man did was write
me a beautiful letter.

194
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,541
Oh my, you should've read it!

195
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,291
Sheer poetry from
beginning to end!

196
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,708
I'll wager my right eye he paid
someone to compose it for him.

197
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,666
The only thing he and his
kin know how to scribble

198
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,375
are receipts and deeds of title.

199
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,833
I'll have you know I wrote
that letter myself, sir!

200
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,375
It's clear they're fond
of each other.

201
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,458
Let love bloom,
that's what I say.

202
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,916
Keeping them apart only brings
them together you know.

203
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
He speaks wisdom.

204
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,625
[GASPARD]
Hmph.

205
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,375
Love or not, he owes me for
deigning to court my daughter

206
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,125
without a by your leave.

207
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:06,208
I demanded remuneration.
His people said go to hell.

208
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,916
So, I've taken to
waylaying merchants

209
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,291
en route to their estate.

210
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,958
Today, I found the li'l
clodpoll nearby and thought,

211
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,666
"Why not truss him up like a
prize stag and bring him here?"

212
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,125
I'll have what's owed me,
even if by ransom.

213
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,208
[GERMÁN, ALFONSO] His ethics
leave much to be desired.

214
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,125
Be that as it may, it doesn't
explain your presence.

215
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,500
[GERMÁN]
Huh?

216
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,416
He's here gathering flowers
for a love of his own.

217
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,208
Señor Germán is
a true romantic--

218
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,333
Uh, actually, I--

219
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,958
And such commendable taste.

220
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,250
Our lilies are a
connoisseur's dream.

221
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,833
Oh, yes, I've heard of them.

222
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,916
At first, we thought your
uncle had come to pick us,

223
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,916
so we came out
blades a-clankin'!

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,250
Indeed. But a few words,
delicately chosen,

225
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,541
and altogether we bonded.

226
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,291
[MAURO]
They're accursed!

227
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,083
[BOTH]
Huh?

228
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,708
The lilies that bloom the
year round are accursed.

229
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:56,083
They thrive by dark magic!
Lady Isabelle was a sorceress!

230
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,958
Mauro! What in
heaven do you mean?

231
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,916
The wife of Count Juste feared
her beauty would wither.

232
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,500
She had waited so very long.

233
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,625
Who could tell when her
husband might return?

234
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:10,875
So, she stole youth from local
maidens, drinking their blood.

235
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,250
[FANA]
Oh, my!

236
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,500
One day, Lord Roland
discovered Isabelle's witchery

237
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,333
and tried desperately
to stop her.

238
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:19,375
He couldn't bear to see
the love of his heart damned.

239
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,833
But she resisted
and killed him,

240
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:25,083
hiding his body somewhere
within the castle walls.

241
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,666
Even so,

242
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,583
when the interminable wars at
last brought Count Juste home.

243
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,625
Albert.

244
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,708
Damnable witch.

245
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:54,125
[MAURO] He impaled her.
That they might die together.

246
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,291
I would stop at nothing
to save my beloved Fana

247
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,541
from the confines
of this evil place.

248
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,958
Enough!

249
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,416
Away with this caterwauling imp!
Lock him in the dungeon!

250
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,000
[MINION C]
Sir!

251
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,041
[MAURO yelps]

252
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,000
[FANA]
Daddy! What are you doing?!

253
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,625
Don't be absurd! Mauro!

254
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:12,500
[GASPARD] Now I've lost my
appetite. I shall retire.

255
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,166
Well, good night.

256
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,041
Bravo, uncle.

257
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:16,958
[GERMÁN]
Hm?

258
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,875
I expected as much, of course.

259
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:19,708
[GERMÁN]
Huh?

260
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,458
As vigilant as ever, I see.

261
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,708
You suspect a Horror might
lurk behind the rumors

262
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,125
and have come to investigate.

263
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,666
No fooling you.

264
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,333
Having them think you're here
to pick flowers for a lass.

265
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,750
A very tasteful lie,
uncle. Well played.

266
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,458
Uh. Yeah.

267
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,708
[chuckles]

268
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,125
[laughs nervously]

269
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,250
Good morning to you,
Señor Germán.

270
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,083
Thank you. Same to you.

271
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,125
Say, Your name's
Ximena, isn't it?

272
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,583
It is.

273
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,458
I'd like to thank you for
taking such good care of me.

274
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,916
What can I give you?

275
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,250
Oh, now, don't bother.
Virtue is its own reward.

276
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,125
I like to show my gratitude.

277
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,666
Hm. What is that?

278
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,458
There's going to be a wedding
at Casa Lomeli tomorrow.

279
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,958
Lovely.

280
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,958
Hm. And what flowers would
you use were it your wedding?

281
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:11,333
Oh, dear. Hard to say,
I like them all, really.

282
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,583
Suppose you could
only pick one.

283
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,375
[XIMENA]
Mmm.

284
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,333
White ones, perhaps?

285
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,625
[GERMÁN]
I don't dare tell the boy

286
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,500
tonight's the first I've heard
of this curse business.

287
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:30,958
[ALFONSO gasps]

288
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,166
[ALFONSO]
Hmm.

289
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,291
[footsteps]

290
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,458
Mauro! Let's get
you out of here.

291
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,666
Fana!

292
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,000
[MINION A]
What is this?

293
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,333
[MINION A] Can you hear me?
Somebody get help!

294
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,750
[MINION B]
What's the meaning of this?!

295
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,208
[MAURO]
Uh-oh.

296
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,375
This way!

297
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,166
I haven't the faintest idea
where we are right now!

298
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,625
[FANA gasping]

299
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,166
What is that?

[BOTH gasp]

301
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,708
[GERMÁN]
Huh. I'll be damned.

302
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:38,416
[GASPARD] I was born in the
wrong era, but Count Juste...

303
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,791
...now there was a man
exemplary of his own time.

304
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,583
[VOICE]
I share your sorrow, old soul.

305

[GASPARD]
Huh?

306
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,083
Who's there?!

307
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,416

the bloody days of yore.

Come out! Show me
your face, swine!

309

[VOICE] Days when you might've
indulged your bloodlust

310
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,000
with impunity.

00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,500

What if you could do so now?

[MAURO gasps]

I think this must be the
Lady Isabelle's chamber.

00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:38,708
Just as I imagined a witch's
inner sanctum would look.

321
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,250
[yelps]

322
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,208
This is Lady Isabelle's
private journal.

323
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,458
How can this be?

324
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,750
Don't tell me. The poor
woman wasn't a witch,

325
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,708
but a Makai Alchemist. Yes?

326
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,291
And far from valorous.

327
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,750
Count Juste and Lord Roland were
in fact full-fledged Horrors.

328
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:03,583
[GERMÁN] Lord Roland became
one first, apparently.

329
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:07,291
He longed to best his rival
for strength and accomplishment.

330
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,750
And Count Juste,

331
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,625
desperate to outstrip
Roland, sold his own soul.

332
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,625
The poor idiots.

333
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,333
Both Horrors adopted the
personalities of their hosts

334
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,875
and continued the rivalry
on an epic scale. For them,

335
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:23,875
the competition was about
consuming the most human souls.

336
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,791
They moved from war to war,

337
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:30,916
scouring villages, and drinking
the blood of young maidens.

338
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,625
Upon discovering their secret,

339
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,208
Isabelle sealed
Roland in the walls.

340
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:38,416
To seal her husband,
she used her own blood,

341
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,458
knowing full well she
would perish in the offing.

342
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,833
So, the lilies were just
one of several Madou tools

343
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:54,041
Isabelle made use of. Huh.

344
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,750
Hm? What's wrong?

345
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:59,083
To think the knights I admired
since my boyhood were Horrors.

346
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,333
You admired what you
thought was strength.

347
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,666
Still, one more lesson
about boyhood heroes,

348
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,083
they always look their
best in storybooks.

349
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,583
[FANA screaming]

350
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:09,708
[ALFONSO]
Uh!

351
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,625
[MINION B]
Who the hell are you?!

352
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,458
[MINION A] Stop! Let go
of Miss Fana at once!

353
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,125
[sword scraping]

354
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,041
[MINION A screams]

355
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,416
[MINION B gurgling]

356
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:33,833
Bastard, you dare lay a hand
on my beloved daughter?!

357
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,291
[growls]

358
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,208
[HORROR JUSTE]
Roland, it's been an age.

359
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:55,083
[grunts] The years have not
abated my strength.

360
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,416
[HORROR JUSTE]
Nor won you my wife.

361
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,125
[HORROR ROLAND, HORROR GASPARD]
Let us see which of us is worthy

362
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,583
to drink her precious blood,
once and for all!

363
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:11,333
[yelling]

364
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,375
[ALFONSO]
Look!

365
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,708
Seems their rivalry's renewed.

366
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:25,916
Right.

367
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,833
[HORROR JUSTE]
Stand aside!

368
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,708
Fana.

369
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,125
[HORROR ROLAND growling]

370
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,333
Test your mettle against me.

371
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,458
What will you do
with the lady?

372
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:49,625
[HORROR JUSTE] I shall wed her
anew, and drink of her blood.

373
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,958
Isabelle will again be my wife.

374
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,291
The lady you hold
is not Isabelle!

375
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,541
[HORROR JUSTE]
It matters not who she is.

376
00:19:56,625 --> 00:20:00,333
When the contest is won,
my love goes to her.

377
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,916
Take heed, young one.

378
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,458
The spoils of
knighthood are legion.

379
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:08,041
Don't speak to me of
knighthood, foul thing!

380
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,583
[BOTH grunting]

381
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,583
Is this what you've
become, Gaspard?

382
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,541
[HORROR GASPARD, HORROR ROLAND]
Are we so different, you and I?

383
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,500
[GERMÁN]
As a matter of fact.

384
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,916

[ALFONSO yelling]

Oh! Thank heavens
you're all right!

[MAURO] My darling, please.
I can't breathe. Fana.

404
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,666
The lilies have done their part.

405
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,666
Who knew white flowers
would be so hard to find.

406
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,333
No one will begrudge me my rest.

407
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,416
Even if I am a prince.

408

[GARM]
Here's to the people.

409
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,250
The townsfolk.

410
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:08,291
The blood, sweat, tears,

411
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:12,125
and raw fortitude that
secure our future.
