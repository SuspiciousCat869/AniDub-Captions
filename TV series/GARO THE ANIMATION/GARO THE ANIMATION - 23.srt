183
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,291
for thinking you would
be equal to this task.

Mm. Well, that's a shame.

I'll ask one last time...
Are you absolutely sure?

203
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,416
[ALFONSO] Either I protect
the people of this kingdom,

or I am no Makai Knight!

You are not qualified
