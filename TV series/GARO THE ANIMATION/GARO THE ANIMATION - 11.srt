1
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:16,916
[GERMÁN, BERNARDO grunting]

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,750
One of these days,
I'd like to take you on

3
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:19,916
in a true fight!

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,166
[GERMÁN]
Just say the word, then.

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,625
[BERNARDO] Our code
forbids us such duels.

6
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:25,416
You never were one to
break the rules, were ya?

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,916
[EMA] He fought
the Black Knight.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,333
León was no match
for one such as him.

9
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:30,875
[GERMÁN]
The Black Knight?

10
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:34,500
[EMA]
Yes. Bernardo Dión.

11
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,041
[gasps]

12
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,750
Now, on to find Mendoza.

13
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,500
[GERMÁN]
Damn.

14
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:43,666
And here I thought
this was going to be easy.

15
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:52,708
Good to see you again, Roberto.

16
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,916
What fun. I guess
neither one of us

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,458
is the same man we were.

18
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:01,791
You have opted to
become a lunatic's hound.

19
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,791
[BERNARDO]
Very witty.

20
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:09,375
Finally... I get to test
those blades of yours.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,125
Heh! It's about time!

22
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:17,666
León, Alfonso. Go on
ahead. He's mine.

23
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,833
[LEÓN]
Wait, old man.

24
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:20,916
Do as I ask, León.
He's not here for you.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,708
No chance I'll
leave you here alone!

26
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,458
Do you know what
he did to me? Uh--

27
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:30,833
Come, Cousin, let's go.

28
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:33,625
We must trust your father
and keep moving forward.

29
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,666
[running footsteps]

30
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,458
[BERNARDO]
Hm!

31
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,416
[grunts]

32
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,166
Anna's boy, I presume?

33
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,791
You gave my son
a fight to remember.

34
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,833
[KNIGHT 11A]
Sir Bernardo!

35
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,500
We fight at your side!

36
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,041
--[KNIGHT 11A yells]
--[KNIGHT 11B] My Lord?

37
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,916
[KNIGHT 11B groans]

38
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:10,500
[BERNARDO chuckles intensely]

39
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:11,583
Hm.

40
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:18,125
[RAFAEL] Where the human heart
embraces evil, Horrors feast,

41
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,291
possessing those
who invite them.

42
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,458
Such vile,
poisonous creatures

43
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,291
have been hunted
since time out of mind,

44
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:28,375
relentlessly pursued
by Men of the Armor.

45
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,291
The Makai Knights!

46
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,166
[GERMÁN]
Just say the word, then.

47
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,708
[BERNARDO, GERMÁN grunt]

48
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,541
[GERMÁN]
Come on, now.

49
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,208
What happened to
the Bernardo I knew?

50
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:35,833
[laughing]

51
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,583
[GERMÁN] Mhmmm...

52
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,750
[continues laughing]

53
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,541
You're just
as mouthy as ever!

54
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:46,875
So, do you wish
to fight me in truth?

55
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:50,083
You know, old friend,
you got real creepy.

56
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,541
[BERNARDO]
Ha!

57
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,000
[GERMÁN]
Now that's more like it.

58
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,208
[MENDOZA]
Fool Bernardo.

59
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,000
I said to choose
your field with care!

60
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,500
This wretched palace
means nothing to me.

61
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,541
Still, I can ill
afford to lose it

62
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,000
before the ritual is complete.

63
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,708
[ALFONSO] You mustn't let your
worries consume you, León.

64
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,833
He'll persevere.

65
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:21,958
Who's worried?

66
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,875
I know that
jackass won't die!

67
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:29,166
[ALFONSO] We've yet to meet
a soul in here. Why is that?

68
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,625
[gasps]

69
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,500
[LEÓN] This explains why
the castle is deserted.

70
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:38,166
Mendoza made sure to empty it so
no one would see his creations.

71
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,125
[LEÓN] Once men.
But now, Horrors.

72
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,583
[ALFONSO] True enough.
Keep your blade at the ready.

73
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,125
They won't back down.

74
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,083
[BERNARDO] Roberto!
Take up your swords!

75
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,958
[GERMÁN] I'll have the story
from you first. Tell me.

76
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,083
Why would you
swear an oath of fealty

77
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,916
to a lunatic like Mendoza?

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,375
[BERNARDO]
I tire of your jesting!

79
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,833
Raise your swords, Roberto!

80
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,500
I don't owe you an explanation.

81
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,041
[BERNARDO grunts]

82
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,666
[GERMÁN groans]

83
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,750
My, my. You've resorted
to some dirty tactics.

84
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,125
Filthy.

85
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:25,166
But still. I said I'd have
the story, and I mean to.

86
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,625
[BERNARDO]
Hm!

87
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,708
Come now.
One doesn't just

88
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:32,375
fall from grace like that.
What happened?

89
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,750
--Fight well.
--We will find you!

90
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,666
Ride hard. Thank me
when next we meet.

91
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:42,875
[SOLDIERS yell]

92
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,833
[CAPTAIN 11A]
Ugh! On your feet!

93
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,458
Leave your horses
where they lie!

94
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,958
Give chase and bring me
that man's head!

95
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,625
[SOLDIERS yell]

96
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,041
[BERNARDO]
Dammit!

97
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,208
[CAPTAIN 11A] Nowhere left
to run, minion of the witch.

98
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,291
[BERNARDO] Heed me!
She is no witch, I swear!

99
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:04,916
[grunts]

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,125
[CAPTAIN 11A]
Take him now!

101
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,166
[SOLDIERS yell]
[BERNARDO grunts]

102
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,791
Damn fool.

103
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,333
[BERNARDO gasps, grunts]

104
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,958
[BERNARDO grunts]

105
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,625
[yells]

106
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,416
There is no haven
to be found

107
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,083
when you swear in the
service of a witch, boy.

108
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,916
What witch do you speak of?

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,125
We have never
harmed you and yours!

110
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,375
You don't understand.

111
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,416
This is a common
trick of sorcery!

112
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,291
Pay no heed to
his words. Take him!

113
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,750
[SOLDIERS]
Sir!

114
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,708
[BERNARDO] Such weak
and shallow creatures,

115
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,708
contemptible in every way.

116
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,250
Too afraid to question
the orders given.

117
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,083
Why must we risk
our lives to save theirs?

118
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,291
[CAPTAIN 11A] You are no more
than a witch's puppet!

119
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,875
Now die!

120
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:57,458
[SOLDIERS groan]

121
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,333
[CAPTAIN 11A]
No. No, please!

122
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,833
[BERNARDO grunts]

123
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,458
[ANNA] We're sworn
to defend them.

124
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,458
Human beings are weak.

125
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,166
Too easily deceived
and led astray.

126
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,416
But they have such
potential hidden inside.

127
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Their hearts beat
with a fierce strength

128
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,458
that makes
reality of dreams.

129
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,750
It's those hearts that we've
sworn to protect and defend.

130
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:27,083
Those hearts that
deserve our respect.

131
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:30,125
They're worth the
sacrifices we make.

132
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,500
I can promise you that.

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,500
[BERNARDO]
Anna.

134
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,125
Aah!

135
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,166
[CAPTAIN 11A]
Bastard!

136
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,875
[groans]

137
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,666
I am a Makai knight.

138
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,000
[groans]

139
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,750
[BERNARDO]
Anna. I can't do it.

140
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,541
I can't trust in them.

141
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,708
[SOLDIER 11A] Captain, sir!
Word from the gates!

142
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,875
They cornered the
other two trying to flee.

143
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,583
A squad is capturing
them right now!

144
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,208
[BERNARDO gasps]

145
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,750
They still live?

146
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,916
[SOLDIER 11A] For now, sir.
They both took heavy injuries.

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,250
[CAPTAIN 11A] Bring them
to the castle, then.

148
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:12,583
Roberto. Anna.

149
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,458
I'll kill you all!

150
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,375
Ugh. It's time
to put an end

151
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,416
to your damned screaming.

152
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,375
[coughs, groans]

153
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,500
Why won't you die?
Filthy witch's mongrel.

154
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:30,208
[BERNARDO yells]

155
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,750
I refuse to let them die.

156
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,250
They can still get away.

157
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,041
I don't care
what happens to me.

158
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:43,083
[exhales deeply]

159
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,791
[SOLDIERS gasp]

160
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,541
Forgive me, Roberto.

161
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,875
I face this day

All men kill one another

It is the natural

They grow, breed, and consume.

To be a man
is to spawn Horrors.

If all we do is wipe the asses
of these pitiful humans,

but what can I possibly do?

Be not a shield
to these people,

Perhaps. But there is still
time to come to the light.

[BERNARDO]
Hm?

208
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,083
[MENDOZA] To see
the world break free,

209
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,958
it is not only people
that must be purged.

210

Makai Knights and Alchemists
who have traveled the dark path

must also face the blade.

must be purged.

[LEÓN yells]

323
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,166
[MENDOZA] Take a page from
our dear prince's manners

324
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,166
and wait there in silence.

325
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,708
These last few steps
should not take very long.

326
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,375
--What the--?
--No.

327
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,958
So this must be...
the forbidden weapon!

328
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,708
The Circle Ema was
telling us about!

329
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,541
Lunatic! He's trying
to summon a Horror

330
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,458
straight from the Makai abyss!

331
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:40,125
[MENDOZA] Trying and
succeeding, I would say.

332
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:44,958
It's actually quite simple.
Desire and hatred.

333
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:48,541
It is the fury of humankind
that summons the beast forth.

334
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,333
[LEÓN]
You spew only madness.

335
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,500
[MENDOZA] I hope the
remnants of my experiments

336
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,458
were no bother.

337
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:58,041
They died never knowing
the glory they would unleash.

338
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,500
I will make you
pay for this.

339
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,625
[MENDOZA] Count your
ignorance a blessing,

340
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,291
the wheels have been
turning for a long time.

341
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:09,541
My Prince, you were but a boy
when it began in earnest.

[ALFONSO gasps]

343
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,708
[MENDOZA] Valiante's peasants
were being slaughtered

344
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,666
just below their King.

345
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,833
He'd smile and wave to
the crowd, all the while,

346
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,875
never smelling the blood
beneath his boots!

347
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,083
Coward!

348
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:25,208
How many of my people
have you murdered?

349
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,416
Good prince,
it's important to learn that

350
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,666
past actions should
never constrain those

351
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,375
who stand above.

352
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,333
A leader must
look ever forward

353
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:36,125
and be judged only by
what he does next.

354

[HORROR 11A growls lowly]

355
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,208
[MENDOZA]
It is truly so rare.

356
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,583
A moon in crimson,
as if soaked in blood.

357
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,208
It heralds the beast
that shall lead this world

358
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,625
to the purifying flame.

359
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:57,041
[ALFONSO] You know we won't
let you get away with this.

360
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,708
Even the strength of your
mighty Watchdog Council

361
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:03,000
is as nothing.
All will flee before it!

362
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,333
To hell with you
and your beast!

363
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:08,125
I'll see you struck
down first, Mendoza!

364
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,541
I shall protect
my people from harm

365
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,291
and defend Valiante!

366
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,416
So confident
these youths are.

367
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,375
And yet,
here is where you die.

368

[HORROR 11A growls]

[GARM] The golden

00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:07,333
to a scarlet moon
draped in fear.

371
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:12,083
Burn you bright,
O seat of power, he rages.
