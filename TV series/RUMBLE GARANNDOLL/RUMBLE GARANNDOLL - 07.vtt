This is the WerdCat informant?

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:19.644 position:50% align:center
Who's also a battery girl?

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:20.729 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
You got it.

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:22.897 position:50% align:center
But the WerdCat thing
isn't constant.

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:25.775 position:50% align:center
Spends most of her time as
a cardboard box shut-in.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.862 position:50% align:center
Though she's both
hacker and hermit.

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:34.242 position:50% align:center
She's also our missing
battery girl: Misa Kuroki!

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:37.662 position:50% align:center
And how'd she go missing?

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:39.247 position:50% align:center
Ã©\Well, Ukai kidnapped--

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.709 position:50% align:center
um, I mean, carefully
took her into custody.

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:44.711 position:50% align:center
Then she vanished the
same day she arrived.

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:46.046 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
What the hell?

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.672 position:50% align:center
[RIN] And none of you
bothered to look for her?

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:50.133 position:50% align:center
She continued communicating
with us through the internet,

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.509 position:50% align:center
so we just let her be.

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:52.802 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS groan]

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.095 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
She's not a kid that pretended

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.348 position:50% align:center
to run away from home, you know.

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:59.601 position:50% align:center
That's right. All this time,
I've just been at the base.

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:01.061 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:03.229 position:50% align:center
The crew members weren't
eating the food left in here.

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:05.398 position:50% align:center
It must've been
this battery girl!

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:09.277 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] So then, neither of
us has a place to call home.

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:10.737 position:50% align:center
Bright light, bright light.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.156 position:50% align:center
Hey, the two of us can
be homeless friends.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.033 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI yells]

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:17.118 position:50% align:center

Ah! WerdCat's outta the box!

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:18.203 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Meow!

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:19.329 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Why'd she turn off the lights?

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:20.538 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Dark, cramped, and dangerous!

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:22.582 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Everyone, calm down!

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:23.833 position:50% align:center
[YUKI, RIN gasp]

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:26.503 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
What's that sou--?

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.004 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI screams]

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:31.132 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] It's a stun gun!
Hurry! This way!

00:01:37.013 --> 00:01:38.181 position:50% align:center
Hey! Open up!

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.891 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Why'd you lock us
out of our own room?!

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:43.103 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICI] Yeah! I mean, the
least you could do is apologize!

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:45.355 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I don't think she's
listening, Hosomichi.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.440 position:50% align:center
So make her listen!

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:26.998 position:50% align:center
None of you are getting
in. Game over.

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:29.334 position:50% align:center
Well, this sucks.
What the heck's her deal?

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:30.794 position:50% align:center
[RIN cries]

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.128 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Hey, let's just cut our losses

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:33.672 position:50% align:center
and give her this little shack.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:37.008 position:50% align:center
This "little shack" has my CDs,
nail polish, and magazines!

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:39.969 position:50% align:center
And my Zaburn toy!

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.305 position:50% align:center
The items we elect to store
in the recharging room

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.058 position:50% align:center
may not seem like all that
much to the average person,

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:46.267 position:50% align:center
but what they see as trash

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:48.561 position:50% align:center
is the battery girls'
priceless treasure.

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:50.271 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.107 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] They're not
trash by any standards

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.483 position:50% align:center
these days, though.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.568 position:50% align:center
Thanks to the True Army
seizing everything

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.570 position:50% align:center
from light novels
to video games,

00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.948 position:50% align:center
those possessions hold just
as much monetary worth

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:02.075 position:50% align:center
as they do sentimental value.

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:03.952 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] Could earn a quick
buck by listing them

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:05.495 position:50% align:center
on illegal auction sites.

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:07.747 position:50% align:center
A few hundred
million yen minimum.

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.917 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] What? A few
hundred million yen?

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:12.043 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Enough goofin' around!

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:13.753 position:50% align:center
Kick the door in, Hosomichi!

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:15.463 position:50% align:center
[UKAI]
You'd just be wasting your time.

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:16.798 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Why's that?

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:18.883 position:50% align:center
It looks ordinary, but that
door's specially made.

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:21.052 position:50% align:center
You sure as hell won't
break it with a kick.

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:23.013 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
So it's like a super shack?

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.514 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
How 'bout we blow it up?

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:26.641 position:50% align:center
[UKAI] You just heard how
valuable the things inside are.

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:29.686 position:50% align:center
We can't guarantee they'll
survive if we get too drastic.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:31.730 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Operation "Coax
the Goddess of the Sun

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:33.648 position:50% align:center
from Her Cave" is a go!

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:36.484 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] I don't recall being
briefed about this op.

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:40.405 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] We'll admire, exalt,
and worship her out!

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:43.324 position:50% align:center

Meow?

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:47.287 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
WerdCat--I mean, Miss Kuroki.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.289 position:50% align:center
Surely you're a
reasonable person,

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:51.708 position:50% align:center
so won't you return
this room to us?

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:54.210 position:50% align:center
We'll take good care
of you in exchange.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:54.961 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Meow.

00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:57.922 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Uh. Huh?

00:04:58.006 --> 00:04:59.799 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.469 position:50% align:center
This picture!

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:04.387 position:50% align:center
It's Mimi's-- Uh.

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.182 position:50% align:center
[MIMI yells]

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:09.809 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] Why in the world
did she drag that up?

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.770 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Perhaps for
the sake of nostalgia?

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:14.356 position:50% align:center
[UKAI] Looked like a sexy
nurse cosplay of the vixen.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.858 position:50% align:center
So Dakki. Good choice.

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:19.235 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] But why a nurse?
She was a queen.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.112 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
Drop it or I'll drop you!

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:24.449 position:50% align:center
Fair. But how did she get
those top-secret files?

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:25.533 position:50% align:center
How else?

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:26.785 position:50% align:center
She's an elite hacker
with a talent

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:29.204 position:50% align:center
for diggin' up
the dirtiest dirt.

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:31.915 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
This is so stupid.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:33.249 position:50% align:center
Uh. What?

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
Don't treat this like
someone else's problem

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.087 position:50% align:center
when it directly affects you.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.631 position:50% align:center
If the base is unhappy,
then you're unhappy.

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.549 position:50% align:center
I'm always unhappy.

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:43.093 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
All I'm saying is stop tryin'

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.260 position:50% align:center
to crack the lock on the door

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:46.388 position:50% align:center
and work the lock on
her heart instead.

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:47.931 position:50% align:center
You feel me?

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:50.642 position:50% align:center
That door's still physically
separating me from her, though.

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:54.562 position:50% align:center
I see. Jobs on tuna fishing
boats more your speed, huh?

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:57.482 position:50% align:center
Or how's about crab
fishing in Okhotsk?

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:59.317 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
And risk my life?

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:01.986 position:50% align:center
I'll take my chances
with the cat.

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:07.033 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Uh, Misa?

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:08.535 position:50% align:center
If you're free for a sec,

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:10.745 position:50% align:center

Sounds like we all did.

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:18.837 position:50% align:center
A mass email?

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.130 position:50% align:center
What is this?

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:21.631 position:50% align:center

It's Hosomichi.

You and I should chat.

It's either that,

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.692 position:50% align:center
or I blow a hole in this
wall with explosives

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:43.445 position:50% align:center
because I don't care about
a single thing in there.

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:45.405 position:50% align:center
Your call.

'Cause it's special, right?

00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:02.255 position:50% align:center
That's why you should let
the other girls use it, too.

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.591 position:50% align:center
Maybe if they weren't so noisy.

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.676 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Then let's make some rules.

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:56.768 position:50% align:center
because you're a seasoned pro.

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:58.645 position:50% align:center
You're smart enough

Attagirl! You've got this, Rin!

[YUKI] Crashing and burning
after a frontal assault

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.703 position:50% align:center
is pretty on brand for you.

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:15.912 position:50% align:center
Stand aside.

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.247 position:50% align:center
You were just button mashing,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.165 position:50% align:center
but I'll show you
what it's like to play.

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
Why are you so mean to me?

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:24.295 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
You see?

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:27.340 position:50% align:center
My leg attacks render her
slide attacks useless.

00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:29.718 position:50% align:center
Cool, but that strategy
leaves your head exposed.

00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:31.052 position:50% align:center
As if.

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:32.554 position:50% align:center
The second I see that
dumb cat go for the head,

00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:34.014 position:50% align:center
I'll use a killer
upper rabbit kick

00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:35.682 position:50% align:center
and knock her into next week.

You're so scary.

[YUKI] She took the bait!
Have a taste of my rabbit foot!

a ripped rabbit,

Uh?

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:00.457 position:50% align:center
Sit back and watch a pro

[HOSOMICHI]
Called it.

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:14.554 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] So, it's up to me to
avenge my fallen comrades?

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:16.014 position:50% align:center
Very well!

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:19.351 position:50% align:center
I will show you my legendary

Legendary, my ass!

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:28.360 position:50% align:center
Kinda surprised how bad
everyone is at this game.

00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:30.195 position:50% align:center
It's not so much the
fact that we're bad

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:33.698 position:50% align:center
as it is the genius hacker
is also a genius gamer.

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:35.784 position:50% align:center
So? What do we do now?

00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:38.244 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA] We let the next

Hm?

00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:41.956 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Ain't that right, Hosomichi?

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.417 position:50% align:center
I think I'll pass.

What a showoff.

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:09.150 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
She caught me!

Hot damn! That's a

[HOSOMICHI screaming]

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:20.995 position:50% align:center
She was holding back when
she fought all of us.

Poor Hosomichi.

Never seen anything

Had a feeling our boy

[BALZAC]
Could it be...?

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:28.396 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
Hm?

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.648 position:50% align:center
[MISA wails]

00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:32.359 position:50% align:center
[MISA] It must've been
a bug in the code!

00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:33.818 position:50% align:center
A special hidden command!

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:35.111 position:50% align:center
One only an old-school gamer

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:37.864 position:50% align:center
would even think
about tryin' to pull off!

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:42.452 position:50% align:center
[MISA] That mega-blast
came out of nowhere.

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:47.582 position:50% align:center
Man, what a fun match.

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:49.501 position:50% align:center
That was nothing short of epic!

00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:51.169 position:50% align:center
Aren't OP attacks kinda cheap?

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:53.421 position:50% align:center
You all wanted me
to win, and I did!

00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:54.631 position:50% align:center
What a surprise.

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:57.801 position:50% align:center
Who knew you were such
a promising gamer?

00:11:57.884 --> 00:12:01.554 position:50% align:center
[MISA] I admit defeat.
Not bad for a womanizer.

00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:02.681 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Hey, don't call people that

00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:04.849 position:50% align:center

know what it means!

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:08.061 position:50% align:center
[MISA] How did you know
about that special move?

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:09.688 position:50% align:center
It was an accident.

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:12.107 position:50% align:center
Mashed a buncha
buttons and got lucky.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.566 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Hmm.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:17.237 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Anyway, we won.
So will you open the door?

00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:19.239 position:50% align:center

Fine.

Another game?

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:28.415 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
We'll do a dungeon crawl next.

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:30.667 position:50% align:center
A dungeon crawl?

00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:38.299 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Dungeon.

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:41.094 position:50% align:center
That word can only refer
to one thing in Akihabara

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:42.804 position:50% align:center
that I know of.

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:44.931 position:50% align:center
The underground labyrinth.

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:47.726 position:50% align:center
It lies beneath the ruins
of the former radio hall,

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:50.437 position:50% align:center
sheltered from the acid rain.

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:58.528 position:50% align:center
CQCQ, it's Murphy, over.

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:01.239 position:50% align:center
[MISA] This is WerdCat.
I hear you loud and clear.

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:04.534 position:50% align:center
Underground area's been
reached. Moving ahead.

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:05.952 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Ten four.

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:07.787 position:50% align:center
This is nice.

00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:11.207 position:50% align:center

way to pick up Comiket <i>doujins</i> !

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:15.462 position:50% align:center
It feels uncomfortable.
Mostly 'cause of this. So bulky.

00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:16.963 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Ain't she a beaut?

[OTAKU DINER B]
I can handle four! Ha!

00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:28.892 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Ain't she a beaut?

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:30.685 position:50% align:center
Due to a dimensional distortion

00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:33.229 position:50% align:center
caused by the True Army's
Earth Vein Needles,

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
various areas of old
Akihabara overlap,

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:37.942 position:50% align:center
resulting in this
rogue-like labyrinth

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:41.488 position:50% align:center
that feels like a real-life RPG.

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:44.783 position:50% align:center
We're three people short
of a full party, though.

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:46.242 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
What?

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.040 position:50% align:center

Well, let's see.

What I'm doing now,
if I'm being honest.

00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:04.928 position:50% align:center
Staying and being part of the

Guys?

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:32.497 position:50% align:center
Those are people who lost
their culture to the True Army

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.541 position:50% align:center
and became shadows
of themselves.

That store sold
laserdiscs at one point!

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.544 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Welp, I'm the only one left.

00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:03.171 position:50% align:center
Why am I doing this again?

00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:05.674 position:50% align:center
[MISA] If you don't wanna
do it, you can turn back.

00:16:05.757 --> 00:16:09.010 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] What I don't
wanna do is catch crabs.

00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:11.388 position:50% align:center
[MISA] Then continue down
to the lower levels.

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:13.848 position:50% align:center
If you can find and secure
what I'm looking for,

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:16.810 position:50% align:center
you'll successfully
clear the bonus stage.

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:18.061 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
So, snagging the treasure

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:20.522 position:50% align:center
unlocks the door to the
princess's chamber.

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:22.774 position:50% align:center
Heh. It really is
like a video game.

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
Do you not like games?

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:26.027 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
What about you?

00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:27.946 position:50% align:center
They're fine.

00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:31.866 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Wonder how
much money I could make

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.451 position:50% align:center
if I sold this junk.

00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:36.913 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's just
collecting dust down here.

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:38.373 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
If you stay too long,

00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:40.625 position:50% align:center
you'll get sucked into the
dungeon and never come out,

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:42.627 position:50% align:center
which is why nobody
goes that far.

00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:44.963 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Uh... Heh.

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:49.676 position:50% align:center
Stalling is cheating!

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:54.180 position:50% align:center
It's not cheating, dear.
You're just fighting an adult.

00:16:54.264 --> 00:16:57.767 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR A]
Uh! Intruder in the dungeon!

00:16:57.851 --> 00:16:58.935 position:50% align:center
Or maybe not?

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:00.812 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing it was
only a false alarm.

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:02.022 position:50% align:center
Hosomichi's on a mission,

00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:05.316 position:50% align:center
but you'd have to be
crazy to go on your own.

00:17:08.445 --> 00:17:09.612 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
What a mundane world.

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:13.199 position:50% align:center
The one saving grace is
it's not on the surface.

00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:20.331 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] Yes. Definitely
based on idealist culture.

00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:21.750 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:30.175 position:50% align:center
This doll's actually quite cute.

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:31.509 position:50% align:center
Is it something
that little girls

00:17:31.593 --> 00:17:34.888 position:50% align:center
used to have tea parties with?

00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:36.139 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:37.307 position:50% align:center
How vulgar!

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.684 position:50% align:center
[clinking]

00:17:39.768 --> 00:17:41.770 position:50% align:center
Wait.

00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:45.815 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh... Oh dear.

00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:50.236 position:50% align:center
[OTAKU C]
A punk. Lolita. Cute. So cute.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.237 position:50% align:center
[OTAKU A]
God?

00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:52.155 position:50% align:center
[OTAKU B]
God?

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:54.449 position:50% align:center
[OTAKU D]
A god has arrived?

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:56.534 position:50% align:center
[OTAKU]
So precious.

00:17:56.618 --> 00:17:59.204 position:50% align:center
Uh, stay back.

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:01.664 position:50% align:center
I-I'm warning you!

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:04.292 position:50% align:center
Please. Don't move a muscle!

00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:06.336 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO screaming]

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:08.755 position:50% align:center
[OTAKU]
So precious.

00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:17.931 position:50% align:center
So heavy. So hard. So painful!

00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:19.724 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
But you did it.

00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:23.228 position:50% align:center
Okay, now move the box
behind you to the right.

00:18:24.229 --> 00:18:27.148 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Oops. I meant the left.

00:18:27.232 --> 00:18:29.651 position:50% align:center
This is just a barrel
of laughs for you.

00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:30.985 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
I'm not laughing.

00:18:31.069 --> 00:18:33.947 position:50% align:center
And again, you could
always just leave.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.323 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
If it's for my princess,

00:18:35.407 --> 00:18:37.992 position:50% align:center
I'm more than happy to oblige.

00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:41.371 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Hey.

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:42.455 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Yes?

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:44.499 position:50% align:center
Just how much do you know?

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:47.335 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
About Jin?

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:50.088 position:50% align:center
Well, I came across the name

00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:52.966 position:50% align:center
when I was taking a deeper
look into your debts.

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:54.217 position:50% align:center
And?

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.970 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
The name's all I know.

00:18:57.053 --> 00:19:02.475 position:50% align:center
Who is it? Your dad?

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:06.146 position:50% align:center
Are you on bad terms?

00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:13.987 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
All right, princess,

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.157 position:50% align:center
has your knight in shining
hardhat met your expectations?

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.035 position:50% align:center
Well, they were pretty high
and you were pretty average.

00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:21.703 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Don't I know it.

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:22.912 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI yelps]

00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:25.248 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
What's wrong, Hosomichi?

00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:29.210 position:50% align:center
Ta-Tanaka?

00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:35.967 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI yelps]

00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:38.428 position:50% align:center
I thought they'd been MIA.

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:40.847 position:50% align:center
[MISA] They must've
gotten stuck somehow.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:43.767 position:50% align:center
Wish I could just
bolt outta here.

00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:48.688 position:50% align:center
What was all that
"god" talk about?

00:19:48.772 --> 00:19:51.733 position:50% align:center
I can't believe they've
forgotten the true gods.

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:01.868 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
This a dead end or the goal?

00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
Some very cyberpunk
themes going on.

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.748 position:50% align:center
Why is this thing
so well protected?

00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:08.958 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Here, I've got you.

00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:16.508 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Okay. You're almost there.

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:20.720 position:50% align:center
What the heck?

A large enemy has been detected!

It's over by Mansei Bridge!

00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:32.941 position:50% align:center
It just suddenly appeared?

00:20:33.024 --> 00:20:35.068 position:50% align:center
How come our tech didn't
pick up on it sooner?

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:37.696 position:50% align:center
You were playing games
in here! It distracted us.

I'll explain later.
Just gear up for now!

What an utterly
deplorable example

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:52.544 position:50% align:center
of filthy, corrupt culture.

00:20:52.627 --> 00:20:56.381 position:50% align:center
Well, since the great Kanda and
Akiba shrines are fairly close,

00:20:56.464 --> 00:21:00.093 position:50% align:center
I'll cleanse this area of
rubbish in their honor.
