[BALZAC] What you see around
you are the remnants

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:18.810 position:50% align:center
of fierce battles that took
place in this now illegal zone.

00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:20.311 position:50% align:center
Through strict censorship,

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:23.064 position:50% align:center
the True Army seized and
abandoned the properties here,

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:25.984 position:50% align:center
leaving behind a graveyard
of broken dreams.

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:31.031 position:50% align:center
And today, it's come to
be Arahabaki's holy land!

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:34.617 position:50% align:center
Our home, sweet home! Akihabara!

about this whole time?

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.419 position:50% align:center
Do you even know?

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:47.839 position:50% align:center
It's like a gang of weirdos.

00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:51.217 position:50% align:center
Look! Dead ahead!
You can see it!

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:55.597 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] At long last,
we've reached our sanctuary!

What's the password?

00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:31.943 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:35.655 position:50% align:center
Arahabaki!

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.492 position:50% align:center

00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:44.372 position:50% align:center
Yes! Good stuff! Just as
awesome as our last password!

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:46.041 position:50% align:center
It's an upside-down "A" and "M,"

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:48.376 position:50% align:center
which of course stands
for "Arahabaki Members"!

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.045 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the nerd alert.

Hmph.

are a bunch of weirdos.

[RIN]
Hey, stop calling us that!

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:05.602 position:50% align:center
When your enemy is someone
like the True Army,

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.645 position:50% align:center
you have to keep
your face hidden.

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:10.148 position:50% align:center
The masks aren't some
fashion statement,

00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:12.567 position:50% align:center
it's a symbol of how
serious they are.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.071 position:50% align:center
Don't you see? We're not
fighting "just because"!

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:18.114 position:50% align:center
And it's not some
half-assed attempt!

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:20.784 position:50% align:center
We're keeping the flames
of culture burning!

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:23.370 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Ah. Gotcha.

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:25.747 position:50% align:center
It must be tough to
fight for your cause.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.793 position:50% align:center
They make you use such tacky
outfits and dopey robots.

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:33.171 position:50% align:center
That's a cosplay, not a uniform.
It's just Rin's hobby.

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:34.547 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
You're kidding me!

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:37.342 position:50% align:center
It may not be an official
uniform, but without it,

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:39.844 position:50% align:center
my soul's unable to make
the Garanndoll move!

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:40.929 position:50% align:center

Your soul sure needs

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:42.597 position:50% align:center
some skintight

Whoa. So where're we now?

[BALZAC laughs]

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:19.759 position:50% align:center

None of us could sync with her,

nothing to do with me.

possibly have to go?

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.160 position:50% align:center

something that I can eat?

[AKATSUKI]
A "garan" doll.

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.271 position:50% align:center
No doubt a reference
to the temples

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.315 position:50% align:center
where Buddhist monks worship.

00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:00.443 position:50% align:center
Not much thought put
into that naming scheme.

Well, anyway, I ordered you to
smoke out the enemy, Musashi.

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:07.325 position:50% align:center
Burning the city to the

What the hell is that?

Oh.

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:21.816 position:50% align:center
Without that nerdy cosplay,

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.569 position:50% align:center
I almost didn't even
recognize you.

00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:26.071 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:29.366 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
So, um...

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.327 position:50% align:center
Are you planning on leaving?

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.497 position:50% align:center
Your fight has nothing
to do with my life.

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:39.376 position:50% align:center
Okay, but! What about
your ringtone?

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.378 position:50% align:center
It's so specific, you know!

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.088 position:50% align:center
That theme is from
such an old show,

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:44.839 position:50% align:center
and no one would use
songs that ancient

00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:46.299 position:50% align:center
if they didn't like anime!

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:47.884 position:50% align:center
I made it my ringtone as a joke

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:50.220 position:50% align:center
and just never bothered
to change it back is all.

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:51.680 position:50% align:center
Look, I get it.

00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:56.351 position:50% align:center
"Zaburn Rumble" is a bop!
I still rock out to it, too!

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:01.272 position:50% align:center
That's like,
your favorite topic?

00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:03.400 position:50% align:center
Superhero animes are my fave,

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:06.528 position:50% align:center
but <i>Zaburn</i> is
definitely the best.

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:09.114 position:50% align:center
I've been in love with
that series for a long time.

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:13.243 position:50% align:center
Way before the
catastrophe happened.

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:16.121 position:50% align:center
It's such an enthralling story.

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:17.956 position:50% align:center
An emperor who's
made it his mission

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:21.126 position:50% align:center
to stop his fellow sea dwellers
from taking over the earth

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:24.796 position:50% align:center
transforms into a giant
warrior of justice.

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:29.676 position:50% align:center
Even though his former allies
brand him as a traitor.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:33.304 position:50% align:center
Keeping the faith that he will
one day reunite with his family,

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:35.432 position:50% align:center
he presses on and
devotes himself

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:38.727 position:50% align:center
to ending the war
between land and sea.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:44.107 position:50% align:center
A truly righteous ruler,
yet a lone warrior.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.151 position:50% align:center
I identify with him
now more than ever

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:50.905 position:50% align:center
because I actually got separated
from my loved ones, too.

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:52.490 position:50% align:center
You did?

00:08:52.574 --> 00:08:55.785 position:50% align:center
See this lake? It wasn't
always a body of water.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:59.539 position:50% align:center
Homes used to be here,
including mine.

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:01.166 position:50% align:center
After the catastrophe,

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:03.585 position:50% align:center
a battle was fought and
there was a huge explosion

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:06.379 position:50% align:center
that destroyed the city
and made this crater.

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:09.341 position:50% align:center
What's left of my house
is at the bottom.

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:11.676 position:50% align:center
Next came the
military annexation,

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.180 position:50% align:center
and I lost contact with my
family during the mayhem.

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:18.141 position:50% align:center
I still haven't found
them to this day.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.517 position:50% align:center
I'd like to believe I'm living

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:22.604 position:50% align:center
the same kind of life
as Emperor Zaburn.

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:25.565 position:50% align:center
And if I just keep on
fighting the True Army,

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:29.319 position:50% align:center
I'll eventually reunite
with my family some day.

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:32.405 position:50% align:center
Then again, I saw
the last episode,

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:35.617 position:50% align:center
but it wasn't clear if Zaburn
was able to pull it off.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.703 position:50% align:center
I'm kind of starting
to doubt he did.

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:40.455 position:50% align:center
I was fortunate
enough to watch it

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:43.166 position:50% align:center
when it was on the dark
net a few years ago.

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:47.295 position:50% align:center
Videos like that have long since
been removed now, though.

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:49.130 position:50% align:center
But there's still
a sliver of hope!

00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:50.840 position:50% align:center
If I can defeat the True Army,

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:54.302 position:50% align:center
then I can recover the master
files of the whole dang anime!

00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:56.137 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
That's crazy.

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:58.014 position:50% align:center
How would confirming
the end apply to you

00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:59.391 position:50% align:center
since it's just fiction?

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:01.393 position:50% align:center
[RIN] It's more than
fiction to people like us!

00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:03.895 position:50% align:center
We have the potential
to become heroes!

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:05.438 position:50% align:center
If you and I combine
our powers--

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:07.649 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
That's trouble I don't need.

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.364 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Sorry for troubling you, then.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.449 position:50% align:center
Thanks for your time.

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:23.456 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Hm?

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.666 position:50% align:center
You make a move?

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:26.292 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Nope.

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:29.337 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA] Well, I'm glad
it's just the two of us.

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:33.425 position:50% align:center
Hows about we grab
some tea? My treat.

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:40.807 position:50% align:center
Had a chat with their
fearless leader.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.350 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Tea?

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:46.187 position:50% align:center
He's enigmatic and crafty--
a combo you can't undervalue.

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:48.606 position:50% align:center
The scariest kind
of guy, for real.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.108 position:50% align:center
Tea?

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:54.279 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA] Well, anywho, I got
you a job as a pilot here.

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:57.073 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Stop jumping from
tangents so I can keep up!

00:10:57.157 --> 00:10:59.075 position:50% align:center
Piloting is a very
dangerous gig,

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:01.494 position:50% align:center
which means they get
lots of hazard pay.

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:03.913 position:50% align:center
That should be my decision
to make, though!

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:05.623 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Oh, really?

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:07.459 position:50% align:center
As the reigning king of debt,

00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
you literally can't
afford to be so picky.

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:14.966 position:50% align:center
Or are you implying you'd
rather sell your organs?

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.177 position:50% align:center
Well, there's also the option
of selling the intel

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.970 position:50% align:center
on these rebels
to the True Army.

00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:21.473 position:50% align:center
So whatever you choose,
we'll be raking in the dough.

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:22.557 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
But all three of those choices

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.976 position:50% align:center
jeopardize my health
in some way!

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.811 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
There you are.

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:29.272 position:50% align:center
Did you finish briefing
Hosomichi on the details?

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:31.441 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA] Yep! He's all
caught up to speed, Yamada!

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:33.109 position:50% align:center
Commander Balzac.

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:35.445 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Right! Commander Balzac, sir!

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.405 position:50% align:center
Before Hosomichi
can join our fight

00:11:37.489 --> 00:11:38.948 position:50% align:center
and be accepted as one of us,

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:42.160 position:50% align:center
he must first be properly
introduced to our leader.

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:43.661 position:50% align:center
And you're saying
that introduction

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:45.663 position:50% align:center
has to happen, like, now?

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:48.500 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Indeed! Brace yourselves!

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:51.086 position:50% align:center
For you're about to meet
the symbol of Arahabaki!

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:52.962 position:50% align:center
Our great leader!

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:56.341 position:50% align:center
Behold!

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:59.886 position:50% align:center
General Tanaka!

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:02.597 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
We're not worthy!

00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:03.431 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
What he said!

00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:05.892 position:50% align:center
Huh? Huh? Huh?!

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:08.144 position:50% align:center
Wait, he's the thing
on the can? Ah!

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:16.027 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Hm? What is it?

00:12:16.111 --> 00:12:20.240 position:50% align:center
Oh-ho-ho. A down payment
for his service, you say?

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:22.701 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
So what's the deal?

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:24.327 position:50% align:center
Why is he dressed up like
a mascot for that canned--?

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:26.329 position:50% align:center
That's enough!

00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:27.997 position:50% align:center
I just need you to focus.

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:29.958 position:50% align:center
You should know Garanndolls
and battery girls

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:31.459 position:50% align:center
are vessels for the soul.

00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:33.920 position:50% align:center
Thus, a half-hearted
pilot can't move them.

00:12:34.004 --> 00:12:35.213 position:50% align:center
Handle with care.

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:37.590 position:50% align:center
Hmm? There something
else you wish to add?

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:39.342 position:50% align:center
Oh, okay.

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:40.593 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:43.596 position:50% align:center
The general says he also
has high hopes for you.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.473 position:50% align:center
Oh, and best of luck!

00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:48.309 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC laughs]

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:51.396 position:50% align:center
She said what? Oh, I see.

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:54.816 position:50% align:center
No! Hmm...

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:57.694 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA] Here, kid. I went
ahead and calculated your cut.

00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:00.655 position:50% align:center
Aw. That's not really
a lot of money.

00:13:00.739 --> 00:13:03.199 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA] At least it's enough
to cover your monthly payment.

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:04.909 position:50% align:center
You greedy leech!

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:07.495 position:50% align:center
There are a lot of fees
that you're unaware of.

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:08.747 position:50% align:center
Ignorance is bliss.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.876 position:50% align:center
I doubt you even know
how much money you owe.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:15.003 position:50% align:center
So work hard to earn
next month's, too.

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:17.756 position:50% align:center
Start by making friends
with that girl.

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:21.092 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] You talking about
the girl that hates my guts?

00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
Hmph. Wait, seriously?

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.933 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA] The screwin' around
stops right here, right now.

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:30.977 position:50% align:center
You can quit acting like
you have feelings to hurt

00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:32.312 position:50% align:center
while you're at it.

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:35.065 position:50% align:center
Think of this chick as one
of your regulars, 'kay?

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:38.443 position:50% align:center
And then just fake it
till you make it with her.

Forget about that
people-pleasing dingus

00:13:58.004 --> 00:14:00.173 position:50% align:center
and try partnering
with me again, yeah?

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:01.466 position:50% align:center
[MEGANE]
Maybe she would if you hadn't

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:04.052 position:50% align:center
flunked the compatibility
test last time, Cap.

No one was taking to you!

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:06.429 position:50% align:center

Hosomichi.

And I realized I can't
leave this place

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:57.731 position:50% align:center

Why would I ignore it, though?

Yeah, I really do.

only to land right in the
middle of the friggin' fire.

00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:43.420 position:50% align:center
Hell. If things get dicey, I'll
just hightail it outta here.

00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:46.673 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR B]
Status report, sir.

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:49.092 position:50% align:center
Battery girl and
pilot are onboard.

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:52.053 position:50% align:center
A true test to see if
he will sink or swim.

00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:54.764 position:50% align:center
Eh, General?

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:56.808 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR A]
Begin releasing illusory mist.

00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:59.769 position:50% align:center
Shark One, manifesting!

00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:03.481 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the hell is happening?

00:17:03.565 --> 00:17:05.150 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
A Garanndoll's form changes

00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:07.861 position:50% align:center
depending on the will of
the battery girl fueling it!

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:11.614 position:50% align:center
Now Shark One has taken
the shape of my soul!

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:13.992 position:50% align:center
You gotta admit,
my soul looks pretty boss!

00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:16.536 position:50% align:center
So it's all for show.

00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:20.665 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR B] Our radar's
picking up two enemy airships

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:22.083 position:50% align:center
approaching from Asakusa!

00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:24.252 position:50% align:center
We're set to engage!

00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:27.005 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec.
That blip's no airship!

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:29.299 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:31.092 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR A] We're getting
two enemy signals,

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:34.596 position:50% align:center
but one's definitely
different from the other!

00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:36.348 position:50% align:center
It's a free-flying Garann!

00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:38.683 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
What? Are you positive?

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:44.105 position:50% align:center
Attention, rebel personnel.

00:17:44.189 --> 00:17:46.358 position:50% align:center
This is your one chance
to lay down your arms

00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:49.402 position:50% align:center
and surrender the Garann that
was sighted in Kabukicho.

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:51.237 position:50% align:center
Only airships can cross
through that mist,

00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:52.947 position:50% align:center
so how is his Garann managing?

00:17:53.031 --> 00:17:55.367 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me that
thing can fly!

00:17:56.618 --> 00:17:58.036 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
A flying Garann?

00:17:58.119 --> 00:17:59.371 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Like it matters!

00:17:59.454 --> 00:18:01.915 position:50% align:center
He could be a breakdancing
Garann for all I care!

00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:05.251 position:50% align:center
We'll still send his metal
hide to the scrapheap.

00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:07.504 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Shark One has
no flight capabilities

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:10.006 position:50% align:center
or long-range weapons.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.509 position:50% align:center
So what's our plan of attack?

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:14.928 position:50% align:center
[WARNING GUIDE A] Safety first.
Please watch your step.

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:17.806 position:50% align:center
Safety first.
Please watch your step.

00:18:17.889 --> 00:18:20.642 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Hey-hey, ready
to become a hero, Rin?

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:23.520 position:50% align:center
Let's do it to it!

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:26.439 position:50% align:center
Huh? You there?

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:28.566 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Ah!

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:29.776 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR A]
It's no use!

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:31.903 position:50% align:center
All the battery girl's
passion has run dry!

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:34.155 position:50% align:center
Shark One has been
completely immobilized!

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:35.490 position:50% align:center
Rin! No!

00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:37.867 position:50% align:center
Corrupting yourselves
by indulging in fantasies

00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:40.537 position:50% align:center
is the epitome of foolishness.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:44.791 position:50% align:center
People of Akihabara,
open your eyes!

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:49.713 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] What? Do you
see something, General?

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:52.549 position:50% align:center
Hm? Yes? What's your point?

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:59.139 position:50% align:center
Sheer genius, sir!
Initiate Plan B! Go!

00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:01.433 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR A] But, Commander,
the target moves!

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:04.519 position:50% align:center
I doubt that plan will succeed
in a situation like this!

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:06.021 position:50% align:center
Don't be so sure.

00:19:06.104 --> 00:19:09.649 position:50% align:center
Especially since that
Garann isn't our target!

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:13.194 position:50% align:center
Commence Operation
Return Ho'oh! Ready?

00:19:13.278 --> 00:19:15.196 position:50% align:center
Fire at will!

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:33.590 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:38.178 position:50% align:center
Ha! Where exactly
were you aiming?

00:19:38.261 --> 00:19:41.181 position:50% align:center
Where do you think?!
Right there!

00:19:43.308 --> 00:19:44.517 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:49.856 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:58.239 position:50% align:center
[CAP]
Ah! They were cheating!

00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:01.910 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] An effective
Operation Return Ho'oh is when

00:20:01.993 --> 00:20:05.330 position:50% align:center
we simply return an object
the True Army has been missing.

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:07.082 position:50% align:center
Divine retribution
is just the icing

00:20:07.165 --> 00:20:09.209 position:50% align:center
on an already sweet, sweet cake.

00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:12.837 position:50% align:center
If only they'd retreat,
but I know better.

00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:15.799 position:50% align:center
Curse you rebels!

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:17.509 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
Captain, I'm here!

00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:24.224 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
As dependable as ever.

00:20:24.307 --> 00:20:26.142 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
I'm always at your service.

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:27.727 position:50% align:center
Though I'm sorry to
report that Ho'oh

00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:30.021 position:50% align:center
is still not combat ready, sir.

00:20:30.105 --> 00:20:32.440 position:50% align:center
Let us fall back for now.

00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:34.150 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Curse that Gayoku.

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:35.735 position:50% align:center
They have someone with
brains on their side

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:38.363 position:50% align:center
if they thought to use
a Winged Fang like that.

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:43.243 position:50% align:center
However, before I retreat, let
me leave you this parting gift!

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:54.504 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:57.799 --> 00:21:00.427 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] When next we
meet on the battlefield,

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:04.472 position:50% align:center
you shall suffer the same
fate as that statue!

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:13.857 position:50% align:center
[RIN] I thought I could be
a hero just like Zaburn.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.151 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] And I said I'll
help make that happen!

00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:18.987 position:50% align:center
What's the issue here?

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:21.573 position:50% align:center
Yep, called that a mile away.

00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:22.532 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Called what?

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:23.700 position:50% align:center
The fact that you're not even

00:21:23.783 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50% align:center
the slightest bit
enthusiastic about this.

00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:27.412 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:29.164 position:50% align:center
Yet even with that mentality,

00:21:29.247 --> 00:21:31.875 position:50% align:center
you were willing to fight
to protect everyone.

00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:33.877 position:50% align:center
I was hoping that
ember of initiative

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.920 position:50% align:center
could spark into
a fiery passion.

00:21:36.004 --> 00:21:39.215 position:50% align:center
Wait, so this whole
time, you knew?

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:41.926 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but that didn't stop
me from being super happy

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:44.012 position:50% align:center
when you agreed to join forces.

00:21:44.095 --> 00:21:45.555 position:50% align:center
Though you may have
been insincere,

00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:48.016 position:50% align:center
part of me wanted to try.

00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:51.644 position:50% align:center
But now I realize someone like
you just can't inspire me.

00:21:51.728 --> 00:21:54.689 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. This is spicy.

00:21:56.483 --> 00:21:59.944 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
My, my, what a fine mess.

00:22:00.028 --> 00:22:03.615 position:50% align:center
Let's see what you can do
to clean it up, Hosomichi.

00:22:07.285 --> 00:22:09.788 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
Hope you don't disappoint.

00:23:46.051 --> 00:23:48.345 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Next time:
"See That? Surprisingly!

00:23:48.428 --> 00:23:50.055 position:50% align:center
A Stunning Comeback!"
