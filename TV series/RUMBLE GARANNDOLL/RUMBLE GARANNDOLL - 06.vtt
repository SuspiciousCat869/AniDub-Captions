Scale Mail Transformation!

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:15.348 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR A] Zaburn,
the Emperor of the Sea,

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:17.350 position:50% align:center
has appeared to wash
away the wrongdoers

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:21.021 position:50% align:center
in a tsunami of justice,
and flood the world with truth.

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:22.897 position:50% align:center
Overcoming all adversity!

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:25.442 position:50% align:center
A gargantuan sea
creature draws near!

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:28.361 position:50% align:center
Quick! Combine! Emperor...

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:31.114 position:50% align:center
[ZABURN]
Zaburn!

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.198 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR A]
A new series...

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:33.575 position:50% align:center
He's just as epic
no matter how much

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:35.785 position:50% align:center
I rewatch this thing!

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.620 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Gimme a break.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:41.041 position:50% align:center
How many times have
you replayed that?

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:42.542 position:50% align:center
It's all I have.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.462 position:50% align:center
The <i>Zaburn</i> series
originally streamed online,

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:49.632 position:50% align:center
and due to the catastrophe,
never got a physical release.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:52.385 position:50% align:center
I keep watching the same
commercial over and over

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.347 position:50% align:center
because it's the
only thing available.

00:00:57.474 --> 00:00:59.142 position:50% align:center
Look! Check this baby out!

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.728 position:50% align:center
Isn't the fin on his
helmet super cool?

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:04.647 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Mhm. About as cool as a sunfish.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:05.815 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.152 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Hello! It's
obviously a shark fin!

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.445 position:50% align:center
Well, sunfish or not,

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:12.781 position:50% align:center
this seems like a silly
boys' hobby to me.

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:15.075 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Ah! Stereotype much?

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:16.868 position:50% align:center
You act so sweet
in front of your fans,

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:18.912 position:50% align:center
but you're so mean
behind the scenes!

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:22.791 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] That was the old me. I'm
done being a superficial idol.

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:24.751 position:50% align:center
Plus, it's unhealthy to
constantly worry about

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:26.461 position:50% align:center
what everyone thinks of you.

00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:29.130 position:50% align:center
My shoulders are as stiff
as a board, Hosomichi.

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:30.840 position:50% align:center
Give me a massage.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:34.010 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
'Kay, I will in a bit.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.930 position:50% align:center
How can you agree to
something that's so indecent?

00:01:37.013 --> 00:01:39.516 position:50% align:center
Because managers
love pleasing idols.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.893 position:50% align:center
Hey, have this talk away
from an open flame.

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:43.269 position:50% align:center
That isn't fair!

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:45.939 position:50% align:center
You said you were my partner
before you ever met her!

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:47.190 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hmm?

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.109 position:50% align:center
You two-timer.

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:50.443 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Ha-ha.

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:52.487 position:50% align:center
[RIN] It's not funny!
Why are you laughing?

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.324 position:50% align:center
You really thought of me as some
sidepiece this whole time?

00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:59.703 position:50% align:center
Rin, don't dive headfirst
into wrong conclusions.

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:02.163 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:04.791 position:50% align:center
Stop petting me like
I'm some kind of puppy!

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:09.087 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Let's dig in!

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.296 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
You two should rest up and eat

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.091 position:50% align:center
while you have the chance.

00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:15.510 position:50% align:center
Who knows when we'll have
to operate the robot again,

00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:17.595 position:50% align:center
so best be ready for whenever.

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.264 position:50% align:center
It's a Garanndoll.

00:02:19.347 --> 00:02:21.474 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Yeah, that thing.

00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:24.519 position:50% align:center
You're doin' pretty well

00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:28.314 position:50% align:center
considering how much
you gripe and groan.

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:30.483 position:50% align:center
As a pilot, I mean.

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:34.487 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Not everyone
likes the jobs they have.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.866 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
At least it pays.

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.035 position:50% align:center
But passion powers Shark One.

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:43.163 position:50% align:center
You have to enjoy
it to some extent.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:46.249 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] That's what makes
that robot so annoying.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.917 position:50% align:center
It's called a Garanndoll!

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.587 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Yeah, that thing.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.131 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA] Well, aren't you
three getting along swimmingly.

00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:54.215 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Why are you here?

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.759 position:50% align:center
Because.

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:29.894 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
By the look of things,

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:32.772 position:50% align:center
I'd say you've got
your groove back.

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:34.024 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
You think?

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:36.192 position:50% align:center
For your sake, I sure hope so.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:39.237 position:50% align:center
You need the mojo to make the
money to pay off your debt.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.489 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI grunts]

00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:42.782 position:50% align:center
Hey, could be worse.

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:44.784 position:50% align:center
You might wanna
count your blessings.

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:46.453 position:50% align:center
I'd hate to stuff
you in an oil drum

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:49.622 position:50% align:center
and dump you in
the sea of trees.

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.291 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Yeah, I hear you.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50% align:center
Boys! Secret secrets are no fun.

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:58.340 position:50% align:center
Hey. We're just
shooting the breeze.

00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:01.885 position:50% align:center
Oh, actually, I have a
message for you guys.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.179 position:50% align:center

command center, ASAP.

Why are we reporting for?

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:12.312 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Behold! A film of
the enemy's propaganda.

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:14.939 position:50% align:center
One that Ukai risked
his life to obtain.

00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:17.233 position:50% align:center
[RIN] So, it shows what life
in their country is like?

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:18.610 position:50% align:center
This should be very enlightening

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:20.612 position:50% align:center
since we've all been
in the dark about that.

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:23.740 position:50% align:center
[CAP] Could even teach us how
to exploit their weaknesses.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:25.241 position:50% align:center
Enough chitchat, everyone.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.243 position:50% align:center
Take a seat and
we'll get started.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.954 position:50% align:center
Here, Hosomichi,
I got us some popcorn!

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:30.538 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.499 position:50% align:center
[RIN screams]

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:36.044 position:50% align:center

[YUKI grunts]

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:44.052 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] Quiet down. This is
important, so pay attention.

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:06.032 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR B] While conducting
phase space energy experiments,

00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:08.326 position:50% align:center
we accidentally
uncovered something.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.373 position:50% align:center
Something that can only be
described as a terrifying truth.

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:15.667 position:50% align:center
We found the existence
of what was dubbed

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.293 position:50% align:center
"an illusory country."

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:21.715 position:50% align:center
A world that mirrors our own,
only it's a complete travesty.

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:23.842 position:50% align:center
A mockery on the
upstanding society

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:26.720 position:50% align:center
we built our Japan to be.

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:28.930 position:50% align:center
One key difference
is how miserably

00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:32.017 position:50% align:center
this farcical Japan
lost in the world war.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.811 position:50% align:center
Japanese pride and spirit
is absent among their youth,

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:36.730 position:50% align:center
while things like anime
and mobile games

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:38.481 position:50% align:center
take precedence in their lives,

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:40.650 position:50% align:center
poisoning their minds
and further influencing

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:42.861 position:50% align:center
their already poor choices.

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:45.947 position:50% align:center
Foolishness at its
finest, and its worst.

00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:49.868 position:50% align:center
A fate as regrettable
as it is deplorable.

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:52.787 position:50% align:center
So what if it's
a parallel world?

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:56.541 position:50% align:center
They're every bit as Japanese
as the rest of us here!

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:58.001 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR B]
A sound conclusion reached

00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:00.503 position:50% align:center
by the military powers-that-be.

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:02.505 position:50% align:center
They know not what they do.

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.341 position:50% align:center
Therefore, it is
our responsibility

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:07.552 position:50% align:center
as the True Country to save
our brethren from themselves

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:12.682 position:50% align:center
and guide them down
the correct path.

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:14.726 position:50% align:center
A decade has passed since
our first encounter

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:16.061 position:50% align:center
with the mirror world,

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:18.938 position:50% align:center
and a third wave of troops
was recently dispatched.

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:20.815 position:50% align:center
With elite soldiers
at his flanks,

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:22.650 position:50% align:center
Captain Akatsuki
now paves the way

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:26.654 position:50% align:center
as we continue our
educational endeavor.

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:28.198 position:50% align:center
Good morning.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:31.368 position:50% align:center
May we use the light of a new
day to awaken their spirit.

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.661 position:50% align:center
It's slept too long.

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:35.497 position:50% align:center
Being raised with
a defeated mentality

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.083 position:50% align:center
has made them
dependent on nonsense.

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:40.585 position:50% align:center
Sadly, they've had their
futures stolen from them,

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:42.504 position:50% align:center
yet they're oblivious to it all.

00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50% align:center
That's why it falls upon
us to help them out.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:48.176 position:50% align:center
It's our duty to take their
hands and unify our worlds.

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:50.804 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.597 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR B] The cherry
blossoms are in bloom,

00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:55.100 position:50% align:center
and the people can't help but
hope our country will flourish

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:58.978 position:50% align:center
just as beautifully with Captain
Akatsuki taking charge.

00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:03.900 position:50% align:center
This broadcast was brought
to you by our military HQ.

00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:14.327 position:50% align:center
Uhh... What the actual hell?

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:15.829 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:18.373 position:50% align:center
A Japan that managed to pull
off a win for the world war.

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:20.125 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the nightmare fuel.

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:22.836 position:50% align:center
Makes no nevermind to me

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:25.046 position:50% align:center
if there's a second
Japan in existence.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.549 position:50% align:center
I find it intriguing,
exciting, even!

00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:31.386 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Those jerks.

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:34.222 position:50% align:center
What right do they have
to censor innocent idols?

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:37.100 position:50% align:center
We are entertainers,
not criminals!

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:39.728 position:50% align:center
I feel the same way
about anime and manga.

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:40.729 position:50% align:center
They chose to cancel them

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:42.689 position:50% align:center
without even giving
them a chance!

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:44.024 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
This is just the first step

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:46.026 position:50% align:center
of their great
cultural invasion.

00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:49.112 position:50% align:center
If we submit and accept
their rigorous terms,

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:51.281 position:50% align:center
it will be the end of our
lives as we know them

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:54.701 position:50% align:center
and the beginning of a
relentless martial law!

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:58.204 position:50% align:center
Right, it's like we're a dam!

00:08:58.288 --> 00:08:59.622 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Close.

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:03.918 position:50% align:center
I'm more partial to the phrase
"last line of defense."

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:05.295 position:50% align:center
[RIN squeals]

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:06.880 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
I just got chills!

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:07.964 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:08.798 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
We're gonna save the world...

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:10.300 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
What's eating you?

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:13.470 position:50% align:center
I dunno. Just not sure
I'm on the right side.

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:15.138 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Huh?

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.181 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Hm?

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:17.349 position:50% align:center
The heck's that mean?!

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:18.975 position:50% align:center
You're saying you
support boring people

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:21.603 position:50% align:center
enforcing their boring ways
on more cultured minds?

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:24.272 position:50% align:center
They hate what we love!
It's not right!

00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:26.483 position:50% align:center
It's tough,
but think logically.

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:29.277 position:50% align:center
The True Army is already
occupying our country.

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:32.572 position:50% align:center
When push came to shove, we
just let them walk on through.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:35.950 position:50% align:center
That kinda speaks to
where most people stand.

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:37.285 position:50% align:center
Huh? Ah!

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:38.912 position:50% align:center
Don't spew that garbage here.

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:41.498 position:50% align:center
You some kinda True Army
sympathizer, or what?

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:42.957 position:50% align:center
You didn't let me
finish, big guy!

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:45.794 position:50% align:center
So, please, put that thing away.

00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:50.590 position:50% align:center
No, I see the point you were
trying to make, 100%, but still.

00:09:50.674 --> 00:09:52.217 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Mimi.

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:57.806 position:50% align:center
I think I should be the one
to handle this. Understood?

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:01.726 position:50% align:center
[UKAI]
Tch.

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:05.438 position:50% align:center
[ALL sigh]

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:06.815 position:50% align:center
I swear.

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:08.066 position:50% align:center
So not cool.

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:09.943 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
What?

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:12.278 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] I'm glad we
could have this talk.

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:14.781 position:50% align:center
You're all dismissed.

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:16.282 position:50% align:center
[YUKI groans]

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:18.368 position:50% align:center
Dealing with idiots really does
a number on my shoulders,

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:21.162 position:50% align:center
so I'm gonna go enjoy
a long, luxurious bath.

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:23.707 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] Oh. Would you
mind if I joined you?

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.251 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Not at all.
You come, too, Rin.

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:28.545 position:50% align:center
Uh, okay.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.716 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Today would be nice!

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:38.805 position:50% align:center
[door closes]

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.605 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
What did I do?

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:55.655 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Yes.

00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:57.907 position:50% align:center
Insist that Kabukicho is
nothing but a pile of ash now

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:00.535 position:50% align:center
because the rebels
chose to resist.

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:02.662 position:50% align:center
Take care not to offend

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:04.706 position:50% align:center
their country's prime
minister, please.

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:06.332 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER A]
Yes, sir!

00:11:08.877 --> 00:11:12.839 position:50% align:center
So easy to quell their
complaints, almost too easy.

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:14.591 position:50% align:center
[MUSASHI] The smart and
merciful thing to do

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:16.676 position:50% align:center
would simply be to purge them.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.554 position:50% align:center
Force alone can't
inspire patriotism.

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:21.556 position:50% align:center
They have to come
meet us halfway.

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:24.017 position:50% align:center
If they don't wish to
understand our philosophy,

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.936 position:50% align:center
we can never be comrades
who share the same future.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.563 position:50% align:center
How very empathetic.

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:30.440 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Hm? Problem?

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:31.858 position:50% align:center
[MUSASHI]
No.

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:35.070 position:50% align:center
Just thinking what a wonderful
leader you are, Captain.

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:36.321 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:37.781 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
Captain Akatsuki.

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:38.656 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.200 position:50% align:center
I have a request.

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:41.242 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Go on.

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:43.161 position:50% align:center
There may or may not
be a dragon vein

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:45.830 position:50% align:center
within the vicinity
of the rebel's base,

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:47.791 position:50% align:center
and I'd like to find it.

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:49.834 position:50% align:center
I'll need three ships, though.

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
You plan to go there personally?

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.546 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.674 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] Well, the only
issue is that my model

00:11:55.757 --> 00:11:58.176 position:50% align:center
is a bit on the heavy side.

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:03.306 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
All right, Rin. You're next.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.141 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Okie doke!

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:08.186 position:50% align:center
Seems you've put on
a little weight.

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:11.481 position:50% align:center
Hosomichi's a great chef, so
it's hard to turn down his food.

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:13.024 position:50% align:center
Aw. How nice.

00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:16.277 position:50% align:center
I don't see what our weight has
to do with powering a robot.

00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:18.488 position:50% align:center
That's classified info you
can't reveal to the public.

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:19.698 position:50% align:center
Is that clear?

00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:21.241 position:50% align:center
Crystal.

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:23.284 position:50% align:center
Though, as your doctor, I must
advise you to gain some weight.

00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:26.287 position:50% align:center
No thanks. I'm an idol
before a battery girl.

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:28.331 position:50% align:center
Don't I know it.

00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:30.083 position:50% align:center
Anyway, let's go ahead and see

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:33.044 position:50% align:center
what your current
passion meter looks like.

00:12:33.128 --> 00:12:36.131 position:50% align:center
Hmm. You've recovered
a little bit.

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:38.091 position:50% align:center
Is a little bit
enough to deploy?

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:39.592 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
Not right now, no.

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:41.177 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:42.345 position:50% align:center
[RIN groans]

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:45.432 position:50% align:center
Uh. But I wouldn't
get discouraged.

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:47.600 position:50% align:center
The most random thing
could suddenly spark

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:49.728 position:50% align:center
the most powerful charge.

00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:53.064 position:50% align:center
Aww... I've been watching
those commercials every day,

00:12:53.148 --> 00:12:54.482 position:50% align:center
so what's wrong?

00:12:54.566 --> 00:12:59.195 position:50% align:center
You may need a stronger stimulus
if that stopped working.

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:02.449 position:50% align:center
Well, the rollercoaster of
emotions you experienced

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:05.368 position:50% align:center
since meeting Hosomichi
is probably a factor, too.

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:08.455 position:50% align:center
The Shark Bite I shared
with him was very passionate.

00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:10.874 position:50% align:center
I hope you're referring
to a Garanndoll attack.

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:11.666 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:12.917 position:50% align:center
And we only pulled it off

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:15.462 position:50% align:center
because we were resonating
with one another!

00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:18.381 position:50% align:center
Think we can still resonate
after the things he said?

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:22.135 position:50% align:center
Earlier? I mean,
we're not that close.

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:25.305 position:50% align:center
I know he's not very
honest with himself.

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:29.309 position:50% align:center
Question for you, Rin.

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:32.395 position:50% align:center
What do you think
of Hosomichi? Hmm?

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:33.730 position:50% align:center
As of right now?

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.815 position:50% align:center
Well, for starters, I don't
think he's the bad guy

00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:37.525 position:50% align:center
everyone makes him out to be.

00:13:37.609 --> 00:13:40.362 position:50% align:center
Ah. As dense as a brick.

00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:42.030 position:50% align:center
I guess what I'm
really curious about

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:44.949 position:50% align:center
is if you think of Hosomichi
as your ideal type.

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:45.867 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Mm-mm.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.494 position:50% align:center
That's what I figured.

00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:50.497 position:50% align:center
But isn't it less exciting
without him around?

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.123 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Hmm...

00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:53.458 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:55.293 position:50% align:center
Why's your face as
red as your hair?

00:13:55.377 --> 00:13:57.170 position:50% align:center
It's from the hot bath water!

00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:59.547 position:50% align:center
Well, he's not without
merits since he can cook,

00:13:59.631 --> 00:14:00.715 position:50% align:center
so there is that.

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:02.717 position:50% align:center
And he's pretty
easy on the eyes.

00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:05.178 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] But it's not like
he's "mister personality."

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:07.180 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] That's precisely
why I don't feel guilty

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:08.807 position:50% align:center
running him ragged
as my manager.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.517 position:50% align:center
Hey! Don't treat him
like some object

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.102 position:50% align:center
that you can just use and abuse!

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:15.230 position:50% align:center
What are you, the leader of
the Hosomichi protection squad?

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:17.232 position:50% align:center
I'm a hero,
and heroes fight fair!

00:14:17.315 --> 00:14:19.984 position:50% align:center
See? And there she goes again,
dodging the main issue at hand!

00:14:20.068 --> 00:14:23.571 position:50% align:center
He's my partner! Of course
I'm gonna care! Ugh!

00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:26.449 position:50% align:center
How can somebody with your
crappy personality knock his?

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:27.450 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
What'd you say?

00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:31.413 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
Ah. Girls will be girls.

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:33.498 position:50% align:center
So energetic.

00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.960 position:50% align:center
[RIN, YUKI scream]

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:38.962 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] How long were
you standing there?

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:42.674 position:50% align:center
No worries. I have zero
interest in 3D women.

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:46.720 position:50% align:center
"No worries" my left
butt cheek, you nasty!

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:50.015 position:50% align:center
You tell 'im, Yuki!

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:52.142 position:50% align:center
That's a world-record
breaking arm right there.

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:53.435 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Screw your compliments!

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:55.020 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:57.480 position:50% align:center
Is there a reason you came to
see us, or are you just bored?

00:14:57.564 --> 00:15:01.151 position:50% align:center
Well, as luck would have it,
I can't find the shopping list.

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:02.360 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
Oh, that's right.

00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:04.654 position:50% align:center
It was your turn to
stock up this week.

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:08.241 position:50% align:center
Wow, even the commander has
to do his share of errands.

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:11.661 position:50% align:center
By the way, since you were
on a Hosomichi tangent...

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:13.955 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] So you're a perv
and an eavesdropper?

00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:17.083 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] I think it's about time
I ask him out on a date.

00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:18.710 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
Uh...

00:15:18.793 --> 00:15:20.420 position:50% align:center
[MIMI sighs]

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:23.923 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] Trying to double down
on your "pervert" status?

00:15:27.344 --> 00:15:30.180 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] Attention all
Illusory Country citizens!

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:31.973 position:50% align:center
Thank you for your dedication!

00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:34.559 position:50% align:center
The workplace must be
revered and protected!

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:37.437 position:50% align:center
Obey your curfew, it's
in your best interest.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.065 position:50% align:center
And remember,
a self-disciplined society

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:43.401 position:50% align:center
makes a strong nation free
of foreign dependence!

00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:44.569 position:50% align:center
This message is
brought to you...

00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:45.862 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI sighs]

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.447 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Why'd you ask me?

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.908 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] We didn't have
enough staff to go around.

00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:51.701 position:50% align:center
Besides, it's good to
have a conversation

00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:53.536 position:50% align:center
with an adult every
now and then.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.372 position:50% align:center
Which one of us is
the adult, though?

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:57.207 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC laughs]

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.167 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
You should drop the laugh.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.419 position:50% align:center
Sounds faker than
my host persona.

00:16:01.503 --> 00:16:04.964 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Heh. Mimi said
something similar.

00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:06.675 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
I'm sure.

00:16:06.758 --> 00:16:09.344 position:50% align:center
She and I have known each
other for quite some time.

00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:10.720 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Huh?

00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:16.476 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
This is the city you saved.

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:19.896 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Saved?
It's been burnt to a crisp.

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:21.564 position:50% align:center
And we both know
what group of rebels

00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:23.566 position:50% align:center
were responsible for that.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.111 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] It could've been much
worse for the city and for us

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:28.530 position:50% align:center
if you hadn't piloted
the Garanndoll.

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:32.659 position:50% align:center
You think? I was just flying
by the seat of my pants.

00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:36.162 position:50% align:center
You may be glad I got
involved, but I regret it.

00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:39.040 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
You regret everything?

00:16:39.124 --> 00:16:42.085 position:50% align:center
Surely you felt something
burning bright within you.

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:45.880 position:50% align:center
Like an inferno of
overwhelming passion.

00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:48.925 position:50% align:center
Kinda hard to say.

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:50.343 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Are you bothered
by how much time

00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:53.054 position:50% align:center
you have to spend
with the girls?

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:55.181 position:50% align:center
I don't do the "friend" thing.

00:16:55.265 --> 00:16:57.100 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:01.479 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Quick question, Yamada.

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:02.605 position:50% align:center
I mean, Balzac.

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:05.191 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Sure, fire away.

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:07.861 position:50% align:center
Why do you want me
to be a pilot?

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:09.529 position:50% align:center
Because, whether
you like it or not,

00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
something inside you
resonated with the Garann.

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:15.869 position:50% align:center
Fate reeled you in.

00:17:15.952 --> 00:17:18.455 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Yeah, right.
The one "reeling me in" is you.

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:21.875 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC laughs]

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:30.759 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Popular girls
don't wear sports bras.

00:17:30.842 --> 00:17:33.011 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Who said I wanna be popular?

00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:35.472 position:50% align:center
I couldn't care less
about that kind of stuff.

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:37.724 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Jeez, you're such a kid.

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:39.601 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Well, Zaburn
likes me the way I am,

00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:41.186 position:50% align:center
and that's all that matters!

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:43.313 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hosomichi isn't Zaburn.

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:44.731 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
That's right!

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:45.982 position:50% align:center
He doesn't need to be!

00:17:46.066 --> 00:17:48.860 position:50% align:center
Hosomichi has his very
own heroic potential!

00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:50.945 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Uhh...

00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:53.073 position:50% align:center
Sure...

00:17:56.076 --> 00:18:00.622 position:50% align:center
Where are we?
Taking a detour for fun?

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:06.378 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] This used to be
the city of Asakusabashi.

00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:07.837 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Yeah.

00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:11.633 position:50% align:center
An explosion turned it into
a lake about a decade ago.

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center
That said, was it due to
a bomb, or something else?

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.264 position:50% align:center
Hm?

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:20.600 position:50% align:center
It's already been ten years.

00:18:20.684 --> 00:18:22.769 position:50% align:center
Right after the catastrophe,

00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:25.522 position:50% align:center
the True Army and Arahabaki
had an intense battle

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:28.441 position:50% align:center
on the very ground
beneath our feet.

00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:30.735 position:50% align:center
Both governments agreed
to destroy all records

00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:33.405 position:50% align:center
of the confrontation.

00:18:33.488 --> 00:18:35.156 position:50% align:center
Proof's right here, though.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.992 position:50% align:center
Can't hide destruction
of this size.

00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:40.120 position:50% align:center
If only the pilot at
the time had realized

00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:42.205 position:50% align:center
the full potential
of his Garann.

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:43.289 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Huh?

00:18:43.373 --> 00:18:45.000 position:50% align:center
It's simple enough in theory.

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:47.043 position:50% align:center
All the Garanndoll needs
is a battery girl

00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:48.712 position:50% align:center
with a heart full of passion.

00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:51.548 position:50% align:center
The purer the passion,
the more power unleashed.

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:55.135 position:50% align:center
At the time, Arahabaki's
pilot was too immature

00:18:55.218 --> 00:18:58.930 position:50% align:center
and the battery girl's passion
transmutated in battle.

00:18:59.014 --> 00:19:01.391 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:04.853 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] In other words, an
unforeseen accident occurred.

00:19:04.936 --> 00:19:07.230 position:50% align:center
Luckily, the citizens had
already evacuated

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:12.027 position:50% align:center
the danger zone and we managed
to keep injuries to a minimum.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:15.488 position:50% align:center
Afterward, Akihabara
became a cursed land.

00:19:15.572 --> 00:19:17.907 position:50% align:center
No one would come within
a stone's throw of it,

00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:20.744 position:50% align:center
until recently.

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:25.040 position:50% align:center
Hey, what happened to the
pilot from that battle?

00:19:25.123 --> 00:19:26.666 position:50% align:center
He put on some sunglasses

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.669 position:50% align:center
and vowed never to remove
them because of that day.

00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:31.171 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI gasps]

00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:36.051 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] For the record, I
really didn't like you at first.

00:19:36.134 --> 00:19:38.011 position:50% align:center
Where did that come from?

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:40.722 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] I was just thinking
how you surprised me.

00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:43.767 position:50% align:center
You're nicer than
I took you for.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:47.228 position:50% align:center
That said, we don't need
a pilot to be nice.

00:19:47.312 --> 00:19:49.606 position:50% align:center
We need someone who's as
shallow as a kiddy pool.

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:51.691 position:50% align:center
A pathetic scumbag of a man.

00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:56.112 position:50% align:center
A lame playboy who doesn't care
about the hearts he breaks.

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:57.614 position:50% align:center
Which is why we chose you!

00:19:57.697 --> 00:20:00.116 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Do you want me to punch you?

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.829 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Be careful, don't ever
transmutate their passion.

00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:08.416 position:50% align:center
Don't make the same
mistake I did.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:12.045 position:50% align:center
Mecha animes only need
one guy with sunglasses.

00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:15.715 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC laughs]

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:19.678 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] He never explained
what transmutating even is.

00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:22.347 position:50% align:center
Aw, man.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.099 position:50% align:center
Thought we had some
leftovers from lunch,

00:20:24.182 --> 00:20:25.642 position:50% align:center
but I guess I was wrong.

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:26.726 position:50% align:center
Possibly.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:28.395 position:50% align:center
Not the first time
food's disappeared

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:29.938 position:50% align:center
from this room, though.

00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:32.774 position:50% align:center
Pretty sure it's every Arahabaki
member for themselves

00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:34.025 position:50% align:center
when it comes to snacks.

00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:35.402 position:50% align:center
Even Mimi's a thief.

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:38.279 position:50% align:center
No friggin' way!
Actually, that makes sense.

00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:39.614 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Mh-hm.

00:20:39.698 --> 00:20:41.157 position:50% align:center
Sucks being a victim.

00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:45.328 position:50% align:center
I was saving a Kapudding Choco,
and then later, poof. Gone.

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:47.288 position:50% align:center
Hey, I come bearing presents.

00:20:47.372 --> 00:20:48.623 position:50% align:center
Yay, bread!

00:20:48.707 --> 00:20:49.833 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:51.376 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Waited in line and everything.

00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:53.878 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Aw, look at you
being all thoughtful!

00:20:53.962 --> 00:20:54.963 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Yeah.

00:20:55.046 --> 00:20:56.256 position:50% align:center
[MISA gasps]

00:20:56.339 --> 00:20:58.299 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
What was that?

00:20:58.383 --> 00:21:01.553 position:50% align:center
Huh, how weird. We don't have
boxes with that symbol.

00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:03.930 position:50% align:center
Wait. Wait, so that's not
stuff for the crew?

00:21:04.014 --> 00:21:05.515 position:50% align:center
Not that I know of, no.

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:06.850 position:50% align:center
It's just a box.

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:09.102 position:50% align:center
[RIN, YUKI]
Stare.

00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:12.063 position:50% align:center
Which is why I'll
approach it carefully.

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:22.449 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:26.619 position:50% align:center
You're too loud.

00:21:26.703 --> 00:21:31.458 position:50% align:center
Um... who... are you?

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:38.381 position:50% align:center
Curry bread, yay.

00:21:39.716 --> 00:21:41.051 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC grunts]

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:50.518 position:50% align:center
I never suspected
she'd hide in here.

00:21:50.602 --> 00:21:52.729 position:50% align:center
Explain! How do you know her?

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:54.731 position:50% align:center
We've been searching for ages.

00:21:54.814 --> 00:21:56.858 position:50% align:center
And now our search
has come to an end.

00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:59.444 position:50% align:center
That didn't answer
the question dude!

00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:01.196 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
She's a talented hacker!

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:05.492 position:50% align:center
And perhaps more importantly,
she's our third battery girl!

00:22:05.575 --> 00:22:09.579 position:50% align:center
Codename: WerdCat!

00:23:46.676 --> 00:23:47.385 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Next time!

00:23:47.469 --> 00:23:48.636 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
"Come out!

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.013 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] The best way
to live as a shut-in!"
