00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:43.960 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Huh?

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.462 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Are you okay?

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.131 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
What?

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:51.634 position:50% align:center
Was that a... girl?

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:56.723 position:50% align:center
Just what the hell is going on?
And how'd it even come to this?

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:04.439 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] A valid question.
Best to take it from the top.

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:15.742 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
I had one goal...

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.328 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
This announcement is for...

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:20.538 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Fill the void
that was my stomach.

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:21.915 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:25.168 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] It's nearly 11 PM,
the hour of the rat.

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.087 position:50% align:center
All citizens without
special permission

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.797 position:50% align:center
must return home at this time.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.256 position:50% align:center
We greatly appreciate
your cooperation.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.675 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Shut up!

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:35.345 position:50% align:center
Don't make people leave
right before my shift starts.

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:37.222 position:50% align:center
[BEARD]
Somebody help me!

00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:39.557 position:50% align:center
I swear! There's nothing
perverted on it!

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:41.559 position:50% align:center
It's for all ages!

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:43.311 position:50% align:center
You'll be disappointed if you're
looking for the good stuff...

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:45.605 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN A] Saw him selling
copies on the street.

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.565 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN B]
A game in this day and age?

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.486 position:50% align:center
[CABARET A]
So, is he, like, an otaku? Ew.

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:55.573 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Yep. Minnows
should know their place.

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:58.326 position:50% align:center
If they don't want bigger
fish to devour them,

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.162 position:50% align:center
they need to stay in
their small ponds.

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:05.250 position:50% align:center
At least, that's the
smart way to live.

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:09.838 position:50% align:center
Or so I'd always thought.
Until that day.

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:15.468 position:50% align:center
[HOST A]
Here's your champagne!

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:19.389 position:50% align:center
[HOSTS]
Let's go! Chug! Chug! Chug!

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:25.145 position:50% align:center
Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Whoo!

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:28.982 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Hey, cutie!
Hosomichi in the house!

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:30.483 position:50% align:center
Um, yeah. Hi, I guess.

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:35.196 position:50% align:center
So, uh, this is our first
time meeting, isn't it?

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.073 position:50% align:center
Yes. It is.

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:40.035 position:50% align:center
I was shocked Japan still had
a host club in operation,

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:42.287 position:50% align:center
so I thought I'd come
check it out for myself.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.749 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Really? Well,
I'm very happy you did.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.084 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] Hey. I'm pretty
sure that's my glass.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:49.294 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI grunts]

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.256 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Ah, shit.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.966 position:50% align:center
[MIMI gasps]

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.760 position:50% align:center
This alcohol is cheap.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:59.554 position:50% align:center
It should never grace
fine lips such as yours.

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:02.432 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] Thanks. But it was
actually non-alcoholic.

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:06.519 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Oh, yeah?
No wonder it tasted lousy!

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:09.439 position:50% align:center
[MIMI laughing]

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:10.899 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
You're hilarious!

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:13.693 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
That means I make you happy!

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:14.778 position:50% align:center
So you should request
me next time...

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:15.987 position:50% align:center
[HOST B]
And there he goes,

00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:17.947 position:50% align:center
flashing that
killer smile again.

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.824 position:50% align:center
Not sure what you mean.

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:21.534 position:50% align:center
Just take a look at the guy.

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:22.869 position:50% align:center
He's laughing it up,

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:25.705 position:50% align:center
but that smile he's wearing
is completely fake.

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:30.293 position:50% align:center
A true expert in the field
of empty gestures.

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:31.920 position:50% align:center
Please?

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:35.924 position:50% align:center
Ugh... I'm starving.

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:37.676 position:50% align:center
[HOST C]
Nice job out there.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.719 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
I guess. Got any food on ya?

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:41.930 position:50% align:center
[HOST C]
Nope!

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:46.267 position:50% align:center
Oh, bT dubs, your phone rang
non-stop while you were working.

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:47.644 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:49.771 position:50% align:center
[HOST C] What's the name of
this song? It's catchy.

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:51.898 position:50% align:center
Of course you wouldn't know.

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:54.818 position:50% align:center
[HOST C]
Dude. You gonna pick up?

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:58.321 position:50% align:center
Nah. Probably just a
customer, so it's whatever.

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:00.448 position:50% align:center
Unless my bed's calling,
I don't even care.

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:02.367 position:50% align:center
[HOST B]
Turn that annoying crap off.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.576 position:50% align:center
[HOST C]
So you're just gonna sit here

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.370 position:50% align:center
and let Munakata
go to voicemail?

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.747 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Hey! Hosomichi speaking!

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:11.292 position:50% align:center
Oh, how's it hangin', man?

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.462 position:50% align:center
You know, I could've
sworn that I told you

00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:17.048 position:50% align:center
to answer within three
seconds when I call you.

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:19.426 position:50% align:center
Which means you
need some practice.

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.594 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Right! All the practice!

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:22.679 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Just wanted to make sure

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.723 position:50% align:center
you have this month's
payment ready.

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:27.183 position:50% align:center
I'll be heading over there
later tonight to collect it.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.144 position:50% align:center
Wait, this month's pay?

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:30.311 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
You do have it.

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.355 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah! Sure do!

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.607 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Good. I'll see you soon.

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:36.818 position:50% align:center
You can count on me!

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:41.322 position:50% align:center
[HOST B]
See? What I tell ya?

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:42.699 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B]
Attention.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:45.744 position:50% align:center
This is an emergency public
service announcement.

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:48.204 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] My dear
Illusory Country comrades.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:51.708 position:50% align:center
I'd like to start by apologizing
for disturbing you at this hour.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
If you don't know,

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:56.463 position:50% align:center
I'm the third-generation
commander of the True Army,

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:58.631 position:50% align:center
Akatsuki Shinonome.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:01.968 position:50% align:center
As you're aware, our forces
have one ultimate goal.

00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:05.055 position:50% align:center
We wish to properly educate
the Illusory Country citizens

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:06.431 position:50% align:center
in hopes that they
may eventually

00:05:06.514 --> 00:05:10.143 position:50% align:center
become True Country citizens.

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:13.021 position:50% align:center
Following the events that
took place a decade ago,

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:15.482 position:50% align:center
we've worked tirelessly
to find anything

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:17.150 position:50% align:center
that defies our doctrine

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:20.487 position:50% align:center
and eliminate it
from this world.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.656 position:50% align:center
Yo, Hosomichi. C'mon, it's time
to get back on the floor.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.867 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Oh, well.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.245 position:50% align:center
If only break times could
earn me a paycheck.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.373 position:50% align:center
Switch on.

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:33.083 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
And what we discovered there

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.459 position:50% align:center
was quite alarming.

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:39.130 position:50% align:center
This area is now a
hotbed of rebel activity.

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:41.383 position:50% align:center
That is inexcusable.

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:47.013 position:50% align:center
Heya! Thanks for requesting
me, you cutie patootie!

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:50.558 position:50% align:center
Sorry. But this is our first
time meeting, isn't it?

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:52.143 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:57.065 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] The area
I speak of is Kabukicho,

00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:59.693 position:50% align:center
and we have hard evidence
to back our claims.

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:02.237 position:50% align:center
Here's exhibit A that links
that zone to the rebels.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.947 position:50% align:center
Concrete proof.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.866 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.743 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] This disc contained
digital information

00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:10.662 position:50% align:center
related to an
escapist simulation

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:12.747 position:50% align:center
known as an "erotic game."

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:14.457 position:50% align:center
But the game is
actually a cover,

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.334 position:50% align:center
hiding instructions
that direct people

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:18.837 position:50% align:center
to the organization's website.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.673 position:50% align:center
There's also a location
mentioned within its code:

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:24.759 position:50% align:center
The special zone, Kabukicho.

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:27.679 position:50% align:center
They were right under our noses.

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.976 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.478 position:50% align:center
I knew this would happen.

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:38.148 position:50% align:center
That den of deceit should've
never even existed.

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.984 position:50% align:center
But at least there's
time to fix that!

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.613 position:50% align:center
You are one thirsty
fish! Glub, glub!

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:47.490 position:50% align:center
[MUSASHI] It's how I
mentally prepare for work.

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:50.243 position:50% align:center
Oh. So, your shifts are
even later than mine.

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:51.327 position:50% align:center
I suppose.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.204 position:50% align:center
But I came here to
sate my curiosity

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:55.457 position:50% align:center
more than my
craving for alcohol.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.001 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Hey, nothing wrong
with an inquisitive girl.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.377 position:50% align:center
At least not to me.

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:00.712 position:50% align:center
Since you're a bit of a sleuth,

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:03.256 position:50% align:center
I can tell you a few
fun facts about myself.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.008 position:50% align:center
Like how I'm working here
to pay off the debt

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:07.344 position:50% align:center
my parents left behind for me.

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:10.889 position:50% align:center
Or you can sate my curiosity
by telling me about you.

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:12.766 position:50% align:center
You into any hobbies these days?

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:14.434 position:50% align:center
You know, I'd love to
hear more about...

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:15.477 position:50% align:center
[MUSASHI]
Excuse me.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.728 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:19.064 position:50% align:center
You can't possibly be
addressing me, right?

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:22.692 position:50% align:center
How can you be when you won't
even look me in the eye?

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:26.488 position:50% align:center
I'm asking if those balls inside
your head are functioning!

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:30.075 position:50% align:center
Are wimps simply incapable
of maintaining eye contact?

00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:31.201 position:50% align:center
If they're just for show,

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:32.702 position:50% align:center
I doubt you'd miss
them all that much

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:35.038 position:50% align:center
if I were to pluck them out.

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:37.207 position:50% align:center
[alarm wailing]

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.709 position:50% align:center
[MUSASHI]
Anyway, it's almost time.

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:42.045 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Time? For what?

It's the background music for

[BALZAC] Someone you haven't

I am Commander Balzac Yamada,

Is that really the
commander on the line?

You know this guy?

I'm kinda busy,
Commander Ball-sack,

How do you even have my number?

[BALZAC] Such details
are inconsequential!

What matters right now

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:05.960 position:50% align:center
is that I get through
to the youth within you.

00:18:06.044 --> 00:18:06.878 position:50% align:center
What?

My boy,

do you not grasp what fuels
the power at your fingertips

known as a Garanndoll?

00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:13.343 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you.

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:16.012 position:50% align:center
It's the essence of dreams
we weave with our souls!

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:17.347 position:50% align:center
Seize those dreams!

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.516 position:50% align:center
And then liberate the
core part of yourself!

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:24.020 position:50% align:center
Scream out loud! Without shame!
Unleash everything you feel!

That won't help us win!

It helps Shark One!

Actually, it helps
all the Garanndolls!

00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:47.502 position:50% align:center
So let everything out with
me on the count of three!

One, two, three!
Shark Cavalier!

00:18:52.424 --> 00:18:53.383 position:50% align:center
Oh, how humiliating.

It embarrasses you, too!

[RIN]
It's different by yourself.

00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:02.308 position:50% align:center
You can have dreams
that light a fire in you

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:04.060 position:50% align:center
just thinking about them.

00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:06.312 position:50% align:center
But that same passion
can easily fizzle out

00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:09.858 position:50% align:center
when you have to face
reality alone.

00:19:09.941 --> 00:19:12.193 position:50% align:center
That's why having someone
who accepts my dreams

00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:15.238 position:50% align:center
and fights by my side
is so important.

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:18.116 position:50% align:center
With no passion,
there's no victory.

Yeah?

Back when you made
your grand entrance,

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.879 position:50% align:center
you gave a cute little speech,

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:16.049 position:50% align:center
something about
protecting the world.

Sounds noble, until you realize
it's a stolen catchphrase.

Because I'm not!
I've just heard it!

And it sorta stayed
stuck inside my mind!
