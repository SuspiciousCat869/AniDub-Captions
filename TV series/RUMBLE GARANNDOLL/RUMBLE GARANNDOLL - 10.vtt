No. What the hell have I done?

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:38.955 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:48.214 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] I think you mean,
"What the hell have we done?"

00:00:57.682 --> 00:01:00.602 position:50% align:center
Ten years flew by fast.

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:03.104 position:50% align:center
There's so much we've
accomplished since then.

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:04.814 position:50% align:center
But on the other hand,

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:07.942 position:50% align:center
there's so much we've
lost along the way.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:12.238 position:50% align:center
You'd think he'd be a
little different by now.

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:19.621 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
Like I'm really one to talk.

00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:22.207 position:50% align:center
[PEOPLE chattering]

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.334 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA] Get your giant
robot 'n' crush that guy!

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:26.169 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Ix-nay on the obot-ray!

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:28.797 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
But you're the pilot!

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.341 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap.

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:34.761 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] Ahh. It seems
fate's in a humorous mood.

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:37.097 position:50% align:center
We shared a meal
and conversation

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.308 position:50% align:center
without knowing
we're bitter foes.

00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:41.685 position:50% align:center
It's settled.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:44.020 position:50% align:center
I wanted answers and I got them.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:47.691 position:50% align:center
I've made my final judgment
regarding this land.

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:24.996 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Behold Akihabara's
ultimate attraction:

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.083 position:50% align:center
The Zaburn statue!

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:31.544 position:50% align:center
Our charms. It's the
same robot but smaller.

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:33.171 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Mh-hm!

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:37.884 position:50% align:center
Was the design
inspired by sharks?

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:39.678 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Good eye!

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:42.305 position:50% align:center
No way it could be
mistaken for a sunfish!

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.182 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
What? A sunfish?

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:45.684 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Wanna know a secret?

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:48.561 position:50% align:center
It's only here 'cause the
Arahabaki team made it for me!

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:50.855 position:50% align:center
How cool is that?

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.274 position:50% align:center
Arahabaki?

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:54.776 position:50% align:center
They thought it would
help me since <i>Zaburn</i>

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
gives me so much strength,
courage, and energy!

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:01.157 position:50% align:center
But isn't <i>Zaburn</i> a story
created to entertain children?

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.035 position:50% align:center
[RIN] I was totally waiting
for you to ask that!

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:05.328 position:50% align:center
You should never poo-poo things

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.288 position:50% align:center
just because they were
originally made for kids,

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:09.833 position:50% align:center
especially when they get
as intense as this show!

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:12.419 position:50% align:center
Listen, no one does
it the <i>Zaburn</i> way!

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.295 position:50% align:center
That's why it's the best!

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.925 position:50% align:center
It's also why the show wasn't
that popular with kids. Eh-heh.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.137 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
Rin, that's idealist thinking.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.514 position:50% align:center
It's a convenient
form of escapism.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:27.017 position:50% align:center
The real world and its
problems will still be there

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.393 position:50% align:center
when the show's over,

00:04:28.476 --> 00:04:30.353 position:50% align:center
and you'll be none the wiser
in how to handle them.

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:34.607 position:50% align:center
Sounds like something
the True Army would say.

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:38.319 position:50% align:center
Thing is, those fantasies
rejuvenate my soul!

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:40.405 position:50% align:center
Gives me the push to keep going!

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:42.282 position:50% align:center
Kinda hard to face
my real-life problems

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:45.493 position:50% align:center
if I'm super down, you know?

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:48.830 position:50% align:center
Anime, games, idols,
merchandise, whatever!

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:52.834 position:50% align:center
They give people a
special kind of energy!

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:54.961 position:50% align:center
And this city was once
brimming with it!

00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:56.588 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
Huh?

00:04:56.671 --> 00:05:01.009 position:50% align:center
[FANS cheering]

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:05.930 position:50% align:center

Rabbit! Foot! Love! Whoo!

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:08.558 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! There are
so many people here!

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.769 position:50% align:center
How did all of you guys know?

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:12.395 position:50% align:center
[FANS]
It's a guerilla gig!

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.732 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Ah! So you saw my post online?

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:17.609 position:50% align:center
Then let's get hoppin'!

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:22.364 position:50% align:center
[FANS cheering]

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:24.074 position:50% align:center

That girl!

[RIN]
Huh?

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:32.999 position:50% align:center
Although I enjoyed the time
I spent talking with you today,

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:35.752 position:50% align:center
I really should be going now.

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.253 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Huh?

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.134 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Um, security?

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:47.972 position:50% align:center
[FAN B]
Yo, is that thing real?

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:49.808 position:50% align:center

This has gotta be staged.

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:51.476 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
Yuki Aoba.

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:53.561 position:50% align:center
There's an arrest warrant
out with your name on it

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:56.314 position:50% align:center
for disrupting the
captain's marathon.

00:05:56.398 --> 00:06:00.443 position:50% align:center
[giggles] Such a little thing
made me such a big deal?

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:01.986 position:50% align:center
What is Hayate doing?

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.197 position:50% align:center
[YUKI yelps]

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.159 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Hey! You said there was
an arrest warrant, not a bounty!

00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:13.039 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE] I'm an officer.
My authority is absolute.

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:17.293 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
For embarrassing Akatsuki,

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:20.088 position:50% align:center
you deserve nothing
short of death!

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:22.215 position:50% align:center

Stop, Hayate!

00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:38.940 position:50% align:center
Do not cause needless
violence in public view!

00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:41.026 position:50% align:center

Captain Akatsuki.

Don't move, or your heart

Yes, sir!

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:55.915 position:50% align:center
[FAN B]
He's kinda kick-ass.

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:59.336 position:50% align:center
[FAN C] Right? A complete 180
from that stupid marathon.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.004 position:50% align:center
[YUKI grumbles]

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.423 position:50% align:center
Can you two, like,
exit stage left?

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.467 position:50% align:center
You're ruining my
adoring fans' concert!

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.135 position:50% align:center
[FANS] So make like
a bunny and bounce!

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:08.970 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but this little
performance of yours

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:12.015 position:50% align:center
was never approved!

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:14.642 position:50% align:center
Akihabara is the
epitome of decadence.

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:17.520 position:50% align:center
Since you won't renounce your
guilty pleasures willfully,

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:20.982 position:50% align:center
the True Army has no choice
but to respond with force!

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:23.193 position:50% align:center
Dude. Way to kill the vibe!

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.862 position:50% align:center
No one asked about
your bad takes!

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:28.698 position:50% align:center
So few of you have
yet to understand.

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:30.575 position:50% align:center
Up until now, we've
shown you delinquents

00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:32.118 position:50% align:center
a great deal of mercy.

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:34.496 position:50% align:center
[FAN B] Shown a great deal

In our holy land, of all places!

Glad you're safe.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.675 position:50% align:center
I was thinking the same thing.

00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:48.968 position:50% align:center
Are you really with him?

00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:52.889 position:50% align:center
I am. Is this the
energy you meant?

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:56.768 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
Thank you for showing me around.

00:07:56.851 --> 00:08:01.564 position:50% align:center
But now... please evacuate
as soon as you can.

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:03.274 position:50% align:center
I'd prefer if you
weren't involved.

You jerk.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:09.197 position:50% align:center
Just waltzed in here

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.075 position:50% align:center
to fraternize with
the enemy for kicks?

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:14.035 position:50% align:center
I needed to see.

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:18.206 position:50% align:center
And now that I have, I realize
what a fool I've been all along.

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:22.377 position:50% align:center
[FANS screaming]

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.629 position:50% align:center
Captain, the time has come.

00:08:24.713 --> 00:08:25.797 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR A]
Heads up!

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.132 position:50% align:center
This isn't the first
encounter we've had

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:28.675 position:50% align:center
with that enemy Garann!

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:32.220 position:50% align:center
But this time it's equipped
with an aerial unit on its back!

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:35.306 position:50% align:center
You're positive there
aren't any strings attached?

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.768 position:50% align:center

puppet flew free of them.

Wow, what a hottie!

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:44.482 position:50% align:center

[HOSOMICHI]
Get back here!

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:49.863 position:50% align:center
I know that the rebel
army is listening.

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:52.073 position:50% align:center
If you all wish to avoid
unnecessary loss,

00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:54.409 position:50% align:center
connect my voice
to the entire city.

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:55.702 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:58.079 position:50% align:center
Seriously?!

00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:00.874 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] Attention foolish
idealists of Akihabara.

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:02.751 position:50% align:center
This is the esteemed
Captain Akatsuki

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:04.294 position:50% align:center
of the True Army speaking.

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.755 position:50% align:center
Within the next 24 hours,
I intend to launch

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:09.632 position:50% align:center
an unrestrained attack
on this land of sin.

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:11.885 position:50% align:center
No! He'd slay us all?

Yes! Please slay me!

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:14.471 position:50% align:center

[AKATSUKI]
If you value your lives,

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:18.600 position:50% align:center
then you and your loved ones
should evacuate the area

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:20.727 position:50% align:center
within that time frame!

So, are you satisfied?

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.912 position:50% align:center

Yes. I shall dawdle no longer.

I, for one, am happy to hear it.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.667 position:50% align:center
You're a real handful
sometimes, sir.

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:48.421 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] I should face
reality like an adult.

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:51.466 position:50% align:center
All right, let's drop it.

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:05.897 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] Come on.
Pick up the pace, unit four.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.566 position:50% align:center
Can't have any of
you falling behind.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:09.943 position:50% align:center
If we don't make it in time,

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:12.195 position:50% align:center
we'll sully our
leader's good name.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:13.571 position:50% align:center
This is your plan?

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:16.491 position:50% align:center
Turnin' this place into
a giant bomb is insanity!

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:19.119 position:50% align:center
Everything inside it'll
be destroyed forever!

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:23.540 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] Yes. Completely
and irrevocably destroyed.

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:26.459 position:50% align:center
Though it's ridiculous,
this seems like the best

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:29.254 position:50% align:center
and most fun way
to break your will.

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:31.339 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO chuckles]

00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:33.591 position:50% align:center
[UKAI]
But all of our memories!

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:40.056 position:50% align:center
Memories! Memories!
Memories! Memories!

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.477 position:50% align:center
Please, don't do this!

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.378 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEPER A] Time for this
old man to stop dreamin'.

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:16.801 position:50% align:center
[UKAI]
Please, don't do this!

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.431 position:50% align:center
So they intend to drop
the Exhibition Center on us.

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:22.807 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR A]
That's the last message received

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center
from Ukai's hidden mic,
but it does seem that way.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.520 position:50% align:center
I'm wondering if the reason
the transmission was cut

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:30.023 position:50% align:center
was because the enemy found it.

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:32.692 position:50% align:center
The irony of the place we've
been dying to get our hands on

00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:35.904 position:50% align:center
being the cause of our demise
is almost too much to bear.

00:11:35.987 --> 00:11:38.656 position:50% align:center
They're dropping it on us
with everything still inside.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.450 position:50% align:center
All those irreplaceable
treasures.

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:43.411 position:50% align:center
And Ukai, he was in tears.

00:11:43.495 --> 00:11:45.830 position:50% align:center
They know our weak spot and
they're not afraid to hit it,

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:47.874 position:50% align:center
even when it's below the belt.

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:50.835 position:50% align:center
Unreal, they're monsters.

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:52.962 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR B] There's an
unprecedented number of Komainu

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:55.757 position:50% align:center
around the Exhibition
Center as we speak.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.511 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] Suffice it to say,
it's time to sink or swim.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:04.224 position:50% align:center
Everybody, listen to me.

00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:06.726 position:50% align:center
Arahabaki is currently
facing the greatest threat

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.478 position:50% align:center
it's ever had to overcome!

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:11.231 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but it's also
our greatest chance!

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:12.524 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
That's right.

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:15.527 position:50% align:center
The path to glory is often
fraught with danger.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.613 position:50% align:center
However, some risks
aren't worth taking.

00:12:18.697 --> 00:12:20.615 position:50% align:center
Which is why participating
in this operation

00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:22.992 position:50% align:center
will not be mandatory.

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:27.247 position:50% align:center
The first meeting concerning
this matter is now concluded!

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.666 position:50% align:center
I entreat only the most
reckless of daredevils

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:31.668 position:50% align:center
to stick around for the second.

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:36.589 position:50% align:center
Very funny. We've come
too far to chicken out! Huh?

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:38.758 position:50% align:center
You can't give up yet,
because giving up

00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:41.803 position:50% align:center
is the same as giving
in to the True Army!

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:44.472 position:50% align:center
We need strength in numbers!

00:12:44.556 --> 00:12:47.183 position:50% align:center
The master files of anime
and movies that never had

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:49.644 position:50% align:center
a physical release are
somewhere in that thing!

00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:51.146 position:50% align:center
If we end up losing
them tomorrow,

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:53.898 position:50% align:center
there's no getting
them back ever!

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:55.692 position:50% align:center
Music will be lost, too.

00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:57.444 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
And original arcade games.

00:12:57.527 --> 00:12:58.695 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:00.989 position:50% align:center
Simply put, the roots
of every weeb in Japan

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:02.782 position:50% align:center
are trapped within
those hallowed walls.

00:13:02.866 --> 00:13:04.784 position:50% align:center
Hey! We still have Shark One!

00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:07.245 position:50% align:center
I'll safely lower the building
before it can drop!

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:09.539 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Don't be stupid.

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:11.041 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
How is that stupid?!

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:14.169 position:50% align:center
My Garanndoll's definitely
powerful enough to pull it off!

00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:15.170 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
It has limits.

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:17.047 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Does not!

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.590 position:50% align:center
Look, you guys,

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:21.926 position:50% align:center
the enemy was nice enough to
tell us to evacuate the city,

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.386 position:50% align:center
so let's go.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.180 position:50% align:center
You're just gonna roll over
and do whatever they say?

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:28.058 position:50% align:center
This is a time where
Zaburn would stand firm!

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:30.935 position:50% align:center
If we all work together,
we can turn the tides!

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:32.395 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Listen!

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:35.690 position:50% align:center
We exist in reality,
not a shounen anime.

00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:37.650 position:50% align:center
The military is
dead serious now,

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:39.527 position:50% align:center
meaning they want us all dead.

00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:40.987 position:50% align:center
Just look around you.

00:13:41.071 --> 00:13:44.366 position:50% align:center
Hardly any of your gung-ho
teammates stayed to fight.

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:48.119 position:50% align:center
They know as well as I do
it's over for the rebellion.

00:13:51.081 --> 00:13:52.874 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Okay, look.

00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:54.417 position:50% align:center
There has to be
something in this world

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:57.003 position:50% align:center
you can't imagine going
a single day without.

00:13:57.087 --> 00:13:58.213 position:50% align:center
So what is it?

00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:00.548 position:50% align:center
For Rin, it's anime
and superheroes.

00:14:00.632 --> 00:14:02.759 position:50% align:center
For Misa, it's games
and computers.

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:05.470 position:50% align:center
And I'll die if I
can't be an idol!

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:07.305 position:50% align:center
Everyone here is
in the same boat--

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:10.100 position:50% align:center
we all have strong feelings
and convictions!

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:13.436 position:50% align:center
Yet you can't even
fathom why that is!

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:19.109 position:50% align:center
You're right, I don't
understand you at all.

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:26.282 position:50% align:center
That's so sad. You really
are a shell of a human.

00:14:33.623 --> 00:14:36.710 position:50% align:center
[MISA] Yuki, aren't idols
supposed to be friendly?

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:38.962 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Shut up, you nerd!

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:53.435 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] I've seen
official records of that day

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:55.061 position:50% align:center
and they state this
lake was created

00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:57.856 position:50% align:center
when Arahabaki's
Garann went berserk.

00:14:57.939 --> 00:15:01.317 position:50% align:center
Intentional or not,
they're the ones responsible.

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:03.278 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Can we talk?

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.239 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
I'm kinda done talking.

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:08.408 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Well, I'm not.

00:15:08.491 --> 00:15:12.037 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] All right, fine.
Let's talk about this lake.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.164 position:50% align:center
You said it was formed
by an explosion,

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:18.168 position:50% align:center
but did you know it was because
of an Arahabaki Garanndoll?

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:19.836 position:50% align:center
I, um...

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:21.838 position:50% align:center
So you did know.

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:25.508 position:50% align:center
How can you fuel that thing with
that in the back of your mind?

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:29.596 position:50% align:center
Because I have absolute
faith in my abilities.

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:34.601 position:50% align:center
And because I also have absolute
faith in you, Hosomichi!

00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:37.270 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
But I'm an empty shell.

00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:38.688 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
That's not true.

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:41.900 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] What you see
in me, I have no clue.

00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:45.320 position:50% align:center
I constantly change myself to
suit the needs of other people.

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:47.280 position:50% align:center
That's my identity.

00:15:47.364 --> 00:15:51.242 position:50% align:center
Okay, but is that truly how you
are when you're around us three?

00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:52.327 position:50% align:center
It is.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:55.038 position:50% align:center
It's an act 100% of the time?

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:57.374 position:50% align:center
Now you get it.

00:15:57.457 --> 00:16:01.378 position:50% align:center
But you had the power
to move Shark One.

00:16:02.504 --> 00:16:04.673 position:50% align:center
And in Shinjuku when
you jumped in to pilot,

00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:07.801 position:50% align:center
we were able to
use Shark Cavalier!

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:10.470 position:50% align:center
Only because you were driven
by your own passion.

00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:11.971 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Liar!

00:16:12.055 --> 00:16:13.640 position:50% align:center
Don't think I forgot about your
"Zaburn Rumble" ringtone,

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:15.600 position:50% align:center
you closet nerd!

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:19.938 position:50% align:center
I'd really like to get to know
you better, if you'd let me.

00:16:20.021 --> 00:16:23.358 position:50% align:center
We can't go our separate ways
and act like strangers.

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
That'd be awful.

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:26.361 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:29.322 position:50% align:center
Give it up. You're
such a busybody.

00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:31.825 position:50% align:center
You're dang right I am!

00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:41.042 position:50% align:center
Do you know who made your
beloved Emperor of the Sea?

00:16:41.126 --> 00:16:45.505 position:50% align:center
No? Well, the producer and
original writer was my dad.

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:53.763 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait. Wha--?!
Wh-What did you just say?

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:56.391 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Jin Tokito is my father.

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:58.059 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Oh! Then that means he produced

00:16:58.143 --> 00:17:02.188 position:50% align:center
<i>Sexy Fox Spirit Dakki-chan</i>
and <i>Battle Gods</i> , too!

00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:03.523 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Yep.

00:17:03.606 --> 00:17:04.858 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
So that's how you knew to do

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:07.110 position:50% align:center
that special attack
against Misa!

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:09.070 position:50% align:center
I'm a huge fan of his!

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:11.448 position:50% align:center
He's done everything from
organizing idol groups

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:13.241 position:50% align:center
to developing video games!

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:15.326 position:50% align:center
In fact, he's worked on
so many projects

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:16.911 position:50% align:center
that there are rumors
saying he's actually

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:19.039 position:50% align:center
a whole team of people!

00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:20.373 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Just one guy.

00:17:20.457 --> 00:17:23.043 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Just one genius guy, you mean!

00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:26.338 position:50% align:center
"Genius" isn't a word
I'd use for him.

00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:29.424 position:50% align:center
Workaholic, now that's
a more accurate term.

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:32.177 position:50% align:center
So is deadbeat dad and husband.

00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:39.768 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] He didn't come home
once while <i>Zaburn</i> was airing.

00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:41.936 position:50% align:center
My mom was really sick back then

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.607 position:50% align:center
and she wound up passing
away during its run time.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.150 position:50% align:center
Dear ol' dad was gracious enough

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:49.778 position:50% align:center
to cover all of
her medical bills.

00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:53.531 position:50% align:center
He just forgot to leave
something for his son.

00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:55.325 position:50% align:center
I can't remember what
life without drowning

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:57.452 position:50% align:center
in an ocean of debt was like.

00:17:57.535 --> 00:17:59.079 position:50% align:center
Oh, well.

00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:01.456 position:50% align:center
He got what he deserved since
<i>Zaburn</i> bombed in the end.

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
Serendipity.

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:07.253 position:50% align:center
I get that you love superheroes
and adore that show,

00:18:07.337 --> 00:18:09.673 position:50% align:center
but the guy who
made it is no hero.

00:18:09.756 --> 00:18:12.842 position:50% align:center
Nope. He's just a
worthless piece of trash.

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center
He could write about love and
friendship themes all day long,

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.848 position:50% align:center
but it didn't mean he
lived them in real life.

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:21.976 position:50% align:center
His stories are
fabricated in every way.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.313 position:50% align:center
Why do you have that ringtone?

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:35.949 position:50% align:center
People use songs they
like for their ringtone.

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:38.493 position:50% align:center
Mine's a warning.

00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:41.413 position:50% align:center
Every time I hear it,
I remember how dumb I was

00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:44.541 position:50% align:center
for loving his
meaningless creations.

00:18:52.507 --> 00:18:56.511 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:18:58.596 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's up?

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:01.641 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA] You answered
within three seconds.

00:19:01.725 --> 00:19:04.060 position:50% align:center
Hey, over here.

00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:08.857 position:50% align:center
Nice night.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.194 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
The heck is this?

00:19:13.278 --> 00:19:16.823 position:50% align:center
Ladies, may I present a brand
new Garanndoll system

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:19.492 position:50% align:center
that could very well turn
the tide in our favor.

00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:21.661 position:50% align:center
Previously, we had to
change the battery unit

00:19:21.745 --> 00:19:24.080 position:50% align:center
depending on the girl.

00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:26.624 position:50% align:center
But now, we only need
one battery unit!

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:28.001 position:50% align:center
It's capable of
holding all three

00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:29.419 position:50% align:center
of our lovely battery girls,

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:31.713 position:50% align:center
so the pilot can switch
between them at any time

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:33.882 position:50% align:center
during the most heated
moments of combat.

00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:35.925 position:50% align:center
I don't like change.

00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:38.094 position:50% align:center
A Garanndoll that can
change its form on the fly

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:40.138 position:50% align:center
sounds pretty handy
if you ask me.

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
It's a true triple threat now!

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
I'm just not sure why it
didn't cross your mind

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:45.060 position:50% align:center
during our meeting.

00:19:45.143 --> 00:19:46.728 position:50% align:center
Yes, well,
it wasn't mentioned

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:48.980 position:50% align:center
because we weren't sure you
could handle the system.

00:19:49.064 --> 00:19:50.690 position:50% align:center
Wait, what do you mean?

00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:54.194 position:50% align:center
You see, an unstable passion
engine is a dangerous thing.

00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:57.322 position:50% align:center
It's sure to end poorly if we
can't keep it under control.

00:19:57.405 --> 00:20:00.575 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] It'll already end
poorly if we don't try, right?

00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:03.244 position:50% align:center
And if anyone has their
passion on lock, it's us!

00:20:03.328 --> 00:20:04.537 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Yeah!

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:07.332 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:10.168 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hey! Where's Hosomichi?

00:20:14.923 --> 00:20:16.383 position:50% align:center
Guess it's whatever.

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:19.177 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he'll save the day,
and right in the nick of time.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.763 position:50% align:center
That just seems to be his style.

00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:25.058 position:50% align:center
Huh? Hold on a second!

00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:29.229 position:50% align:center
I haven't seen Munakata around!
Does anyone know where he went?

00:20:31.022 --> 00:20:31.856 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Huh?

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.733 position:50% align:center
[alarm blaring]

00:20:33.817 --> 00:20:35.026 position:50% align:center
Hey! Status!

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.319 position:50% align:center
Extremely bad!

00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:37.737 position:50% align:center
The Garanndoll
isn't in the hanger

00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:39.280 position:50% align:center
and we're also missing a truck!

00:20:39.364 --> 00:20:42.409 position:50% align:center
All signs point to Hosomichi
being the one who stole them!

00:20:42.492 --> 00:20:43.952 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
What?!

00:20:44.035 --> 00:20:49.916 position:50% align:center
No! There's just no way!
That jerk betrayed us?!

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.334 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA laughs]

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:53.211 position:50% align:center
Oh, like hell we were
gonna stay tied down

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:55.171 position:50% align:center
to that freakshow forever!

00:20:55.255 --> 00:20:59.175 position:50% align:center
At least we got a decent robot
to pawn off to the True Army.

00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:01.261 position:50% align:center
Right, Hosomichi?

00:22:46.783 --> 00:22:48.993 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
That slimy little guppy!

00:22:49.077 --> 00:22:50.745 position:50% align:center
What's important
is to stay calm.

00:22:50.829 --> 00:22:52.831 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Shouting is
what's keeping me calm!

00:22:52.914 --> 00:22:55.583 position:50% align:center
How was my manager duped
by that greasy sleazebag?

00:22:55.667 --> 00:22:57.293 position:50% align:center
What a disappointment.

00:22:57.377 --> 00:23:00.338 position:50% align:center
[YUKI grunting]

00:23:00.422 --> 00:23:02.007 position:50% align:center
[TANAKA]
Please settle down.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:03.550 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:09.514 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hold on, who said that?

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.895 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:23:15.979 --> 00:23:20.358 position:50% align:center
General Tanaka! Are you about
to show us your final form?

00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:35.832 position:50% align:center
You all have done well,

00:23:35.915 --> 00:23:38.418 position:50% align:center
but I think it's time
I take the lead.

00:23:38.501 --> 00:23:40.795 position:50% align:center
For starters, the second
Arahabaki meeting

00:23:40.879 --> 00:23:42.714 position:50% align:center
will now begin.

00:23:42.797 --> 00:23:44.674 position:50% align:center
Brace yourselves.

00:23:46.593 --> 00:23:48.511 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Next time!
"I want to believe in you!

00:23:48.595 --> 00:23:49.971 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
This time!"
