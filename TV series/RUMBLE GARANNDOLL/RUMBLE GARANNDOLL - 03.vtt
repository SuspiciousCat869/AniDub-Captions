Listen well, O evil invaders

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.563 position:50% align:center
who would endanger our world,

I will not hesitate
to take on any fools

Ha-ha!

00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:35.994 position:50% align:center
I see you have little concern
for the fate or our captive.

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:40.749 position:50% align:center
No! Don't be tricked, Zaburn!
I'm fine! So fight!

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:43.835 position:50% align:center
Um. Why is she their hostage?

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:47.547 position:50% align:center
Gah! And just who the hell are
you creepers supposed to be?

00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:54.304 position:50% align:center
Hey! Back off!

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:57.515 position:50% align:center
Psyche-diving seems so weird.
You sure it's safe?

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:58.975 position:50% align:center
There's some risk involved,

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.479 position:50% align:center
but it's the only way we can
make contact with Rin.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:05.148 position:50% align:center
She closed off her heart
during that last sortie,

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:08.151 position:50% align:center
so now she's stuck.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:11.321 position:50% align:center
[CAP] That dipshit's
actually inside Rin.

I'm starting to think
we're gonna need

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:18.995 position:50% align:center
a bit more hazard pay.

[MIMI]
Passion engines are so fickle.

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:29.714 position:50% align:center
The power output
increases in response

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:31.758 position:50% align:center
to the battery girl's fervor.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:34.010 position:50% align:center
But once that blazing
enthusiasm runs out

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.721 position:50% align:center
and her heart turns cold,
the system freezes, too.

00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:39.349 position:50% align:center
It's annoying with
a capital "A."

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:42.185 position:50% align:center
Ah. A swan among the ugly ducks.

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:44.187 position:50% align:center

like you get here?

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.941 position:50% align:center
Oh, my, are all host club
managers as forward as you?

00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:50.193 position:50% align:center
All right! Keep screwin'
around with me.

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:51.945 position:50% align:center
You'll find out what
happens, I swear!

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:53.780 position:50% align:center
What's his deal?

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:56.658 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] Looks like he's
about to take the stage.

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:58.243 position:50% align:center
Finally.

00:01:58.326 --> 00:02:02.247 position:50% align:center
Now, I wanna see exactly what
a host from Kabukicho can do.

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:35.965 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
Hmm.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.302 position:50% align:center
This is quite the dangerous
machine, Commander.

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:40.595 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Seemed like a piece of junk

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:42.931 position:50% align:center
that can't perform at
critical moments to me.

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:44.724 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
Yes, well, its lack of movement

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:47.310 position:50% align:center
is what confirmed my suspicions.

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:50.230 position:50% align:center
Apparently, it functions
through use of the obsolete

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:52.607 position:50% align:center
Type-Zero Soul Infusion Engine.

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:54.651 position:50% align:center
Type-Zero?

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:57.529 position:50% align:center
It doesn't use the same
engines as our Garanns?

00:03:57.612 --> 00:03:59.114 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
Correct.

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:03.076 position:50% align:center
For you see, our machines are
fueled by a pilot's patriotism.

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.870 position:50% align:center
However, this older model
utilizes another person

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:07.163 position:50% align:center
as its power source,

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:09.332 position:50% align:center
making the system
extremely volatile

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:12.711 position:50% align:center
since it's easily influenced
by the source's emotions.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.754 position:50% align:center
It's really a shame
Hakuro was no match

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:17.674 position:50% align:center
for a defective
piece of scrap metal.

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:21.261 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't take this
"scrap metal" so lightly.

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:22.387 position:50% align:center

Now what?

How's Lake Asukasa relevant?

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:25.849 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
Perhaps you're unaware,

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:28.685 position:50% align:center
but that lake didn't exist
before the catastrophe.

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:30.353 position:50% align:center
Beneath its surface are remnants

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:33.148 position:50% align:center
of what was once another
bustling part of the city.

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:34.441 position:50% align:center
You're kidding me!

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:38.361 position:50% align:center
Their Garann's capable of
that much destruction?

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:41.990 position:50% align:center
Radicals have no business
playing with such a deadly toy.

00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:44.451 position:50% align:center
It must be confiscated.

[BALZAC] Mimi, what are
your thoughts on the boy?

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:54.336 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
As of now,

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.963 position:50% align:center
the way he can lie through his
teeth without blinking an eye

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:59.341 position:50% align:center
reminds me of the pilot
we had before him.

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:00.884 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Really?

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center
I'm joking, of course. He's got
much more going on upstairs.

My limbs are attached!
Stop being so rough!

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:11.061 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] But if he wants to become
a battery girl's partner,

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.645 position:50% align:center
he'll need to use
that cleverness

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.440 position:50% align:center
to overcome this challenge solo.

00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:18.568 position:50% align:center

the wrong guy!

Somebody who's as slick as you

00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:37.379 position:50% align:center

his customer's face.

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:38.922 position:50% align:center

There ya go.

I'm also the mechanic who
takes care of all things

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.725 position:50% align:center
related to the battery girl.

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:52.894 position:50% align:center
From her equipment
to her mental health.

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:54.771 position:50% align:center
Which is why we should
have a little chat.

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:57.607 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Hey, take it easy!

00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:59.651 position:50% align:center

Three guesses what this is.

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:01.236 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Huh...?

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.613 position:50% align:center
It's me.

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:05.323 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
You were doomed to fail.

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:06.616 position:50% align:center
How can partners triumph

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.868 position:50% align:center
when one won't look
the other in the eye?

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:12.122 position:50% align:center
But the chance to redeem
yourself hasn't passed you by.

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:15.417 position:50% align:center
Question is, will you
actually take it?

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:19.921 position:50% align:center
I've been had.

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:22.924 position:50% align:center
Hosomichi? So are they
just taking anyone hostage?

00:06:23.008 --> 00:06:24.342 position:50% align:center
Yeah, seems that way!

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:26.219 position:50% align:center

You make it sound so simple.

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:28.590 position:50% align:center
Part of him reawakened.
He's embraced the boy within.

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:31.509 position:50% align:center
[RIN] You know,
the bodysuit's not a uniform.

00:17:31.593 --> 00:17:32.719 position:50% align:center
Aren't you embarrassed?

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:34.137 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Big time.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.680 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Then why?

00:17:35.764 --> 00:17:38.391 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Because I've done
way more cringe-worthy stuff

00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:40.310 position:50% align:center
while trying to act cool.

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:43.396 position:50% align:center
Like hitting on y--
the robot yesterday.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.191 position:50% align:center
It's my fault we're
in such hot water.

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:48.777 position:50% align:center
I may not be the partner
you've been dreaming of,

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.112 position:50% align:center
at least not yet.

00:17:51.196 --> 00:17:54.282 position:50% align:center
But please, just give me
a chance to make it right!

00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:56.951 position:50% align:center
It would suck if
things ended this way!

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:08.213 position:50% align:center
That was a nice speech 'n' all,
but do you honestly believe

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:10.340 position:50% align:center
that you and I have a
decent shot at winning?

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:11.383 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Surprised you asked

00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:13.093 position:50% align:center
since I already
answered that today.

00:18:13.176 --> 00:18:14.552 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:17.597 position:50% align:center
The only battles I fight are
the ones I know I can win.

00:18:17.681 --> 00:18:21.184 position:50% align:center
We've got this, I'm positive.

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:26.272 position:50% align:center
If anyone can make
it happen... it's you!

[CROWD cheering]

[HOSOMICHI]
From now on, you'll-- No.

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:47.877 position:50% align:center
From now on,
we'll both be Zaburn!

00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:51.423 position:50% align:center
[RIN, HOSOMICHI]
You can do it!

00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:54.759 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Roger that!

Zaburn!

[HOSOMICHI]
Hey, don't go off on your own!

00:19:02.225 --> 00:19:03.810 position:50% align:center
We do this together!

00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:05.186 position:50% align:center
You know what we need?

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.812 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
What?

00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:07.397 position:50% align:center
Some theme music!

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.732 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Huh?

00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:10.650 position:50% align:center
You brought your phone, right?
So play the song!

00:19:10.734 --> 00:19:12.235 position:50% align:center
You really wanna hear it?

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:14.112 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Uh, duh!

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:16.740 position:50% align:center
Fine, gimme a sec.

00:19:18.283 --> 00:19:19.659 position:50% align:center

Switch on!

[music playing]

Aw, yeah!

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:31.004 position:50% align:center
This song is a bop among
bops! Let's rock 'n' roll!

00:19:34.174 --> 00:19:36.843 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR A] Shark One's energy
is surging off the charts!

You just wait.

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:40.263 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
A man and a woman,

00:19:40.347 --> 00:19:43.183 position:50% align:center
like Kan'ichi and
Omiya from that novel.

00:19:43.266 --> 00:19:45.560 position:50% align:center
Like Akatsuki and me.

00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:50.857 position:50% align:center
Wait! What? Oh. Know your
place, you big idiot!

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.986 position:50% align:center
Huh? Curses! I neglected
them too long!

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:03.995 position:50% align:center
Time to turn the
tides! You ready?

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.121 position:50% align:center
They're turned!

00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:06.956 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
This is what happened last time.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.042 position:50% align:center
No, they're even stronger!

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:10.585 position:50% align:center
Bursts of passion do vary.

00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:11.878 position:50% align:center
Especially when a Garanndoll

00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:14.798 position:50% align:center
has a pilot accompany
its battery girl.

00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:18.259 position:50% align:center
And the passion between the
opposite sex can be strong.

00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:23.765 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI, RIN]
Shark Cavalier!

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:24.891 position:50% align:center
Powered Fang!

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:26.476 position:50% align:center
What the heck is
a "Powered Fang"?

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:27.977 position:50% align:center
Fang's the name of this sword!

00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:30.563 position:50% align:center
When you get a chance, think
of a name for the other one!

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:31.815 position:50% align:center
There're more?

00:20:31.898 --> 00:20:34.609 position:50% align:center

I will put an end to you!

00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:38.071 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] All right then,
I'll call mine "Agito"!

00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:44.786 position:50% align:center
They have two swords.

It attacks with such power!

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.754 position:50% align:center
Almost as if it

Burning-Hot Bulls-Eye!

[HAYATE] Your swordplay's
primitive, at best!

00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:07.934 position:50% align:center
And yet, it's so eager!

00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:14.899 position:50% align:center
Type-Zero's true power.

00:21:14.983 --> 00:21:17.110 position:50% align:center
No, it can't be.

00:21:18.862 --> 00:21:21.322 position:50% align:center

Take that! Hah!

Let's finish her off!

With our new special attack!

Man, you're one bossy battery!

00:21:32.334 --> 00:21:33.835 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Fine.

00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:35.837 position:50% align:center

Calm yourself and you'll see
it's a strategic retreat.

00:22:07.035 --> 00:22:09.954 position:50% align:center
We can learn from all of
the data you've obtained.

00:22:10.038 --> 00:22:11.664 position:50% align:center
Sir.

00:22:17.045 --> 00:22:20.382 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Oh my gosh! We actually
managed to pull off a win!

00:22:20.465 --> 00:22:22.509 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course we did.

00:22:22.592 --> 00:22:24.969 position:50% align:center
I didn't doubt you
for a single second.

00:22:25.053 --> 00:22:27.305 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:22:27.389 --> 00:22:29.349 position:50% align:center
Huh? Was that seriously it?

00:22:29.432 --> 00:22:31.643 position:50% align:center
[CAP] She did so
freakin' good out there.

00:22:31.726 --> 00:22:33.311 position:50% align:center
[MEGANE]
Way to go, Rin!

00:22:33.395 --> 00:22:36.064 position:50% align:center
[POCHA]
Oden.

00:22:41.611 --> 00:22:43.988 position:50% align:center
[RIN] That was really cool of
everyone to band together

00:22:44.072 --> 00:22:45.615 position:50% align:center
and glue the head back on.

00:22:45.699 --> 00:22:47.450 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Yeah, we wanted
to give you something

00:22:47.534 --> 00:22:49.202 position:50% align:center
to come back to.

00:22:51.663 --> 00:22:52.664 position:50% align:center
[RIN sighs]

[HOSOMICHI]
Hey, you all right?

00:22:54.332 --> 00:22:56.459 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna get sucked
into another dream.

00:22:56.543 --> 00:22:58.545 position:50% align:center
This should be the
good kind of sleep.

00:22:58.628 --> 00:23:01.631 position:50% align:center
The type where you burn up
every last bit of energy.

00:23:01.715 --> 00:23:04.050 position:50% align:center
I'll just be a total
jellyfish for a while,

00:23:04.134 --> 00:23:05.802 position:50% align:center
but that's not so bad.

00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:08.763 position:50% align:center
Ha. That mean you've
lost your sting?

00:23:08.847 --> 00:23:10.807 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
You're just jelly.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:12.809 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Am I now?

00:23:20.942 --> 00:23:24.237 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
So he rose to the challenge.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.739 position:50% align:center
I knew he would.

00:23:25.822 --> 00:23:27.991 position:50% align:center
It's refreshing to have a man
with brains on the squad.

00:23:28.074 --> 00:23:29.159 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't you agree?

00:23:29.242 --> 00:23:32.662 position:50% align:center
Uh. Well, anyway,
though we're victorious,

00:23:32.746 --> 00:23:35.749 position:50% align:center
Rin's exhausted from the
past few days she's had,

00:23:35.832 --> 00:23:38.293 position:50% align:center
which brings our
progress to a halt.

00:23:38.376 --> 00:23:40.545 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
Are you sure?

00:23:40.628 --> 00:23:44.632 position:50% align:center
Last I checked, there's
more than one girl.

00:23:46.092 --> 00:23:47.510 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Next time:
"No Matter What!"

00:23:47.594 --> 00:23:48.720 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
"I'll be an Idol!"
