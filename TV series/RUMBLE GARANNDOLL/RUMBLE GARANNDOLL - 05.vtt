Her heart made this.

What the Garandoll
transforms into

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:16.850 position:50% align:center
is a product of her passion.

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.727 position:50% align:center
So she's really
into plushies, huh?

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.771 position:50% align:center
This tells me she's put up
some incredibly thick walls.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.482 position:50% align:center
Yes, her heart's been
closed off from the beginning.

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:29.112 position:50% align:center
What a shame. She only
acted like she was ready.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:32.115 position:50% align:center
She's graduating? Like,
going solo, or what?

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.576 position:50% align:center
Her career was still
in in its infancy.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.245 position:50% align:center
So, how're you gonna pay?

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:38.997 position:50% align:center
The breach of
contract fee, I mean.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.540 position:50% align:center
Hey, why am I paying?

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:43.418 position:50% align:center
We took a huge hit 'cause our
golden goose flew the coop,

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:45.462 position:50% align:center
so someone has to pay.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.298 position:50% align:center
You pickin' up what I'm putting
down, Mister Manager?

So let's do this thang, guys!

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:58.053 position:50% align:center
[MEGANE] Wow! You're really
at a hundred percent?

00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.304 position:50% align:center

You bet!

This form. Yuki made it?

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.146 position:50% align:center
[CAP] Made a mess
of things, more like.

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:12.067 position:50% align:center
It had such a flashy debut, but
was totally useless in battle.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.611 position:50% align:center
It's all beat up. This is bad.

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:15.820 position:50% align:center
[MEGANE]
"Bad" is right!

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:17.197 position:50% align:center
That's why we should
forget this form

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.823 position:50% align:center
and change it back to Shark One.

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:20.283 position:50% align:center
No way!

she'll come back?

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:33.004 position:50% align:center
Hosomichi went to go
find her, so of course.

Yeah! The guy super sucks!

Nah, don't be silly.

I trust him, 'cause a battery

we discovered a new weapon

How'd you find me?!

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:21.720 position:50% align:center
We're rebels, so of course
we have some informants.

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:24.014 position:50% align:center
The one I used is
called "WerdCat."

You saw how much of
an embarrassment I was.

I don't love being an idol
enough to go through that again.

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:07.909 position:50% align:center
It's gotten super annoying,
to tell the truth.

Yes, I know. It's baffling.

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:18.128 position:50% align:center
What kind of asinine business
dolls up immature girls

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.547 position:50% align:center
and then worships the
ground they walk on?

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.549 position:50% align:center
Makes me sick.

Idols aren't just cute girls!

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:39.232 position:50% align:center
They use music and
dances to shape dreams!

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:40.567 position:50% align:center
They can heal wounded hearts

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.736 position:50% align:center

At least, according to my mom!

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:52.120 position:50% align:center
[MUSASHI] I was going
to overlook this,

Is she an idealist?

00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:57.375 position:50% align:center

anything rash, ma'am.

You're a member

bully the weak.

Was that the real
you or is this?

00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:28.573 position:50% align:center
Well, either way, I've decided
to let things slide this time.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:34.371 position:50% align:center

If I am, it's 'cause of how
much you groveled at her feet!

I mean, you called
that witch "ma'am"!

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:47.736 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
So, it was there after all.

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:49.029 position:50% align:center
It sure was.

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:50.655 position:50% align:center
Though only people
elbows-deep in the business

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:52.741 position:50% align:center
would know about an
item as rare as this.

00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:55.493 position:50% align:center
It was never digitized,
which begs the question,

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:57.203 position:50% align:center
who are you, my dude?

00:08:57.287 --> 00:09:01.374 position:50% align:center
A pro should do his job without
asking questions, "my dude."

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:02.834 position:50% align:center
See you back at HQ.

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:05.420 position:50% align:center
Ah, come on! Really?

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:07.922 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Yuki.

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:09.341 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Huh?

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:11.676 position:50% align:center
You and I should meet up again
tomorrow if you're free.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.845 position:50% align:center
What? Why?

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:16.473 position:50% align:center
So that you can meet you
the idol of your dreams.

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:17.807 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:29.361 position:50% align:center
[UKAI]
We got the goods,

00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:32.072 position:50% align:center
but he paid the ultimate
price for that to happen.

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:35.116 position:50% align:center
[POCHA] I'm so sorry.
It's my fault he's gone.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.036 position:50% align:center
[CAP] Not like he's dead.
He was just sent to Odaiba.

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:39.287 position:50% align:center
[MEGANE]
Being sent to Odaiba

00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:41.414 position:50% align:center
is a fate worse than
death, you fool!

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:46.211 position:50% align:center
Well, hopefully, Hosomichi
won't waste his sacrifice.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:49.297 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Hey, you came!

00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:52.300 position:50% align:center
[grumbles]

00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:56.429 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] The view
of it here is fantastic.

00:09:56.513 --> 00:09:57.931 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
You're not wrong.

00:09:58.014 --> 00:10:00.684 position:50% align:center
But this area's off limits.
How'd you swing this?

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.060 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] I know a guy
who knows some guys

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:04.104 position:50% align:center
and they hooked me up.

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:07.273 position:50% align:center
I didn't come cheap though, and
now my debt is bigger than ever.

00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:08.858 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI chuckles]

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:12.153 position:50% align:center
Well? Is this part of your grand
scheme to rekindle my passion?

00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:13.697 position:50% align:center
Who knew "meeting my dream idol"

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.324 position:50% align:center
was just a trip
down memory lane?

00:10:16.408 --> 00:10:19.202 position:50% align:center
What a scam. All lies.
You really suck.

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.454 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI grunts]

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:24.791 position:50% align:center
Still, it was nice
to come and see it.

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:28.753 position:50% align:center
Once more, for old time's sake.

00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:31.047 position:50% align:center
Inside those walls
is where I experienced

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:34.467 position:50% align:center
my first live concert
with my mom.

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:36.845 position:50% align:center
It's the stage of dreams.

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:39.973 position:50% align:center
People would work their whole
lives to stand up there.

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:41.683 position:50% align:center
It's coated with
the tears of joy

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:44.352 position:50% align:center
fans wept along
with their heroes.

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:47.063 position:50% align:center
A bright, happy place
many yearn to reach.

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:49.232 position:50% align:center
Or used to, at least.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:52.152 position:50% align:center
They've made it so
nobody can reach now.

00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:54.195 position:50% align:center
Which is why someone
should retake it.

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:56.197 position:50% align:center
That someone isn't me.

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:58.491 position:50% align:center
Your fans would like
it to be, you know.

00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:01.911 position:50% align:center
They dream about seeing their
favorite idol up on that stage.

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:03.997 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Some dreams don't come true.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.124 position:50% align:center
I practiced singing and dancing.

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:09.336 position:50% align:center
Made my own clothes.
Worked part-time to pay for it.

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:11.546 position:50% align:center
I poured my heart and
soul into this thing--

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:13.590 position:50% align:center
gave it all that I had.

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:16.217 position:50% align:center
Then along came
the Garanndoll gig.

00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:17.427 position:50% align:center
I doubt I would've been chosen

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.596 position:50% align:center
if the other girls
were still around.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:22.599 position:50% align:center
My performing skills were pretty
average compared to them,

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:25.560 position:50% align:center
the only thing I excelled
at was surviving.

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:28.438 position:50% align:center
So I boarded the Garanndoll,
thinking if I could power it,

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:31.816 position:50% align:center
everyone would accept me
regardless of my actual talent.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.403 position:50% align:center
However, I do need talent
if I want to shine.

00:11:35.487 --> 00:11:38.782 position:50% align:center
They call it a pipe dream for
a reason and mine is flushed.

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:39.741 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Not yet.

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:41.242 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:44.871 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Sorry, but it's
not just your dream anymore.

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:46.498 position:50% align:center
You can't flush
something that belongs

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:49.417 position:50% align:center
to all the fans of Yuki Aoba.

00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:50.752 position:50% align:center
What're you saying?

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:52.879 position:50% align:center
I'm saying idols don't
have to shine on their own,

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:54.631 position:50% align:center
and we can help you!

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:57.217 position:50% align:center
And by "we," I think
you know who I mean.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.677 position:50% align:center
What is this?

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.970 position:50% align:center
The song you'll be singing
in your concert today.

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:01.763 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:03.223 position:50% align:center
The stage is at Akihabara.

00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:05.308 position:50% align:center
Starts at six o'clock sharp,
so don't be late!

00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:06.559 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute!

00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:08.228 position:50% align:center
You can't just decide
that stuff on your own!

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:10.313 position:50% align:center
I can if I'm your manager.

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:11.606 position:50% align:center
But if you're set on quitting,

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.067 position:50% align:center
you obviously
don't have to show.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
All the fans can do is hope
the curtain will rise

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:19.114 position:50% align:center
and their dreams will come true.

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:33.545 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
This song-- How did he?

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:43.430 position:50% align:center
[POCHA] The light check's done.
How's the sound equipment?

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:46.266 position:50% align:center
Whatcha thinkin'?
She gonna flake or show?

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:47.392 position:50% align:center
I know what I'm hoping

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:49.561 position:50% align:center
since I can't pay
my debt without her.

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:51.688 position:50% align:center
Well, you still have most
of your organs, right?

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:54.357 position:50% align:center
And even if you didn't, there
are lots of parts that sell.

00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:55.775 position:50% align:center
Guess what they are!

00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:57.068 position:50% align:center
No.

00:12:57.152 --> 00:12:58.862 position:50% align:center
I'm keepin' my fingers
crossed that she shows up

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:00.697 position:50% align:center
before the enemy does.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.198 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
We're in trouble.

00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:05.535 position:50% align:center
News of this secret, fan-club-
only concert is trending.

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:07.662 position:50% align:center
How in the world did
it spread so quickly?

00:13:07.746 --> 00:13:09.831 position:50% align:center
I def had a hand in
spreading the word!

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:11.374 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:14.336 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Now every major fan
in Japan will be in attendance!

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:15.587 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.048 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR A] A True Army
Garann is on its way!

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:20.800 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] What moron tipped them
off and told them to mobilize?

00:13:20.884 --> 00:13:22.427 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
Uh...

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.971 position:50% align:center
[MUSASHI] Is everyone
in Arahabaki a moron?

00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:28.266 position:50% align:center
Or is this a defiant
act of some kind?

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.894 position:50% align:center
Surround the target location
immediately on arrival.

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:36.066 position:50% align:center
Do not waver. All who resist are
to be sent straight to Odaiba!

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.359 position:50% align:center
I'm reporting live!

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:39.861 position:50% align:center
Late last evening,
rumors of a guerrilla gig

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:42.906 position:50% align:center
exploded on an illegal
social networking site.

00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:46.368 position:50% align:center
The government is currently
investigating the issue.

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:49.662 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Hop to and
remove Rabbit Two's armor!

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:51.915 position:50% align:center
We're releasing Shark
One in safety mode!

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:54.793 position:50% align:center
So Hosomichi and Yuki
still aren't here yet?

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:57.754 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Rin, you may be fighting solo,

00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:01.424 position:50% align:center
but a true hero always has
faith in her comrades.

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:02.926 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
You're right!

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:08.223 position:50% align:center
Okay! I'll do my part,
too, you guys!

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:13.728 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. You'll fight again.
I have faith in you, too.

00:14:13.812 --> 00:14:16.439 position:50% align:center
[UKAI] Oh, crap balls.
We're already surrounded!

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:19.567 position:50% align:center
Oh, man. Can we make
it out in one piece?

00:14:19.651 --> 00:14:22.195 position:50% align:center
If you bite the big one, I'll
pick up your organs afterward.

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:25.073 position:50% align:center
You're just jealous
because I have a heart!

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:26.783 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Stop right there!

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:29.744 position:50% align:center
[MUSASHI]
That voice!

00:14:29.828 --> 00:14:31.329 position:50% align:center
Well, if it isn't the Shark!

00:14:31.413 --> 00:14:33.456 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Shark!

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.417 position:50% align:center
[MUSASHI]
Ugh. What're you carrying?

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.253 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure it was just
lying around on a trash heap.

00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:41.506 position:50% align:center
Behold Excalibur, the sword
that slept in our holy land!

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:43.299 position:50% align:center
She can't summon Cavalier
without a pilot,

00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:46.136 position:50% align:center
so she needs options,
and that's a darn good one.

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:47.095 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:49.556 position:50% align:center
[MUSASHI]
No matter. Attack!

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:51.641 position:50% align:center
[RIN yelling]

00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:53.685 position:50% align:center
They tore Excalibur to shreds!

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:56.354 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Using ranged
weapons is cheating!

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:01.568 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hey! Get it together!

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:03.069 position:50% align:center
We all lose if you lose!

00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:06.823 position:50% align:center
And I mean more than the fight!
We'll lose idols, too.

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.450 position:50% align:center
[explosion]

00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:13.580 position:50% align:center
I've got you covered,
so get in the Garann!

00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:15.081 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI yells]

00:15:15.165 --> 00:15:16.124 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER C]
Freeze!

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:17.167 position:50% align:center
You're under arrest
for promoting

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.085 position:50% align:center
an illegal performance!

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:20.795 position:50% align:center
It's over, kid!

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:27.302 position:50% align:center
[FANS]
Rabbit! Foot! Love! Whoo!

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:30.472 position:50% align:center
The random groupies?

00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:32.182 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN A] We hopped over
as soon as we heard!

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:35.018 position:50% align:center
If anyone's gonna protect
Yuki-rin's stage, it's us!

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:36.227 position:50% align:center
Hey! Listen here--

00:15:36.311 --> 00:15:37.729 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER D]
Stand back. They're dangerous.

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:39.147 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN A]
Look! It's Yuki-rin!

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.066 position:50% align:center
[FANS cheering]

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:42.859 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] You bunny-loving
bunch of idiots!

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:45.653 position:50% align:center
What are you doing out here?
You're way too reckless!

00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:47.697 position:50% align:center
Especially since this
is on behalf of a girl

00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:49.115 position:50% align:center
you don't even know!

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:51.451 position:50% align:center
The person I've shown you
till now wasn't real!

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:54.621 position:50% align:center
You all fell for an idol
I was pretending to be!

00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:56.790 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN B]
We know!

00:15:56.873 --> 00:16:00.710 position:50% align:center
We're well aware you tear other
idols apart under alt accounts.

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:02.837 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Uh. Huh?

00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:06.508 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN A] And how you're
more salty than sweet.

00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:08.843 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
You were there?

00:16:08.927 --> 00:16:11.137 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN C] You are pretty
manipulative, too.

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:13.306 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
You were here, too?

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:14.516 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN C]
You're warped and shallow,

00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:16.476 position:50% align:center
but we love every
last part of you!

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:19.521 position:50% align:center
The bad, the ugly,
even worse, all of it!

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:21.564 position:50% align:center
This might call for
a restraining order.

00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:24.442 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN A] We won't ditch you.
We're here to cheer you on!

00:16:24.526 --> 00:16:27.362 position:50% align:center
[FANS]
Yeah! That's right!

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:29.906 position:50% align:center
[MUSASHI] What are you imbeciles
standing around for?

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:34.327 position:50% align:center
That girl is the idol holding
this concert! Seize her!

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:38.248 position:50% align:center
Over my dead body!

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:41.209 position:50% align:center
[MUSASHI]
A flash grenade?

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:43.962 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Now's our chance, Yuki!

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:46.506 position:50% align:center
Let's get this concert started!

00:16:47.966 --> 00:16:49.217 position:50% align:center
But I--

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.678 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
No buts!

00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:54.139 position:50% align:center
If you let this
opportunity pass you by,

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:56.224 position:50% align:center
you're out of
friggin' your mind!

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:59.102 position:50% align:center
Everyone's fighting so you
can stand on that stage.

00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:03.732 position:50% align:center
You even have viewers watching
online. This is your moment.

00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:06.443 position:50% align:center
Even the True Army made it out.

00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:09.070 position:50% align:center
Stages don't get
more epic than this!

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:11.406 position:50% align:center
It's your dream,
so why hesitate?

00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:13.283 position:50% align:center
Not only do you get to live it,

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:15.785 position:50% align:center
you get to take your
fans along for the ride!

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:19.622 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.
I have to live my dreams.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.083 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Mhm.

00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:25.045 position:50% align:center
Attention! Prepare
a gear exchange!

00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:27.088 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Exchange?

00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:28.423 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Rin!

00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:30.300 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Hosomichi!

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.636 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
It's about time!

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.890 position:50% align:center
Sorry to for the wait.
I've got it now.

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:37.891 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Hm?

00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:40.518 position:50% align:center
[RIN screams]

00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:42.896 position:50% align:center
[RESISTANCE yelling]

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:45.732 position:50% align:center
[CAP] Hosomichi! We come
bearing the new battery!

00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:47.567 position:50% align:center
[POCHA]
The Yuki-rin palanquin!

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.611 position:50% align:center
[RESISTANCE]
Heave-ho!

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:55.992 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Hey, why are you going
through all this trouble

00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:58.244 position:50% align:center
just for my sake?

00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:01.873 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] At first,
it was because I thought

00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:03.249 position:50% align:center
you were like me.

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:04.584 position:50% align:center
What?

00:18:04.668 --> 00:18:05.835 position:50% align:center
We're pretenders.

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:08.004 position:50% align:center
We do all we can to
make others happy,

00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:11.591 position:50% align:center
with fake smiles smeared
across our faces.

00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:13.134 position:50% align:center
But I was wrong.

00:18:13.218 --> 00:18:16.137 position:50% align:center
I learned you and I are
completely different.

00:18:16.221 --> 00:18:17.764 position:50% align:center
Even at your lowest low,

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:20.433 position:50% align:center
your love for idols
shines like a lightstick.

00:18:20.517 --> 00:18:23.561 position:50% align:center
What's more, you shine, too.

00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:27.190 position:50% align:center
The love you have for yourself
as an idol burns so bright.

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:28.191 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:29.526 position:50% align:center
[RESISTANCE cheering]

00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:31.194 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] When you stand
in front of an audience,

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:34.781 position:50% align:center
you radiate that enthusiasm,
and it lights up a room!

00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:37.325 position:50% align:center
People can't help
but be drawn in by it,

00:18:37.409 --> 00:18:41.413 position:50% align:center
and before they know it,
they're your fans.

00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:45.000 position:50% align:center
I'm drawn in, too.
Like a moth to a burning flame.

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:47.711 position:50% align:center
And I want to see
that passion thrive!

00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:51.256 position:50% align:center
Simply put, it's the whole
reason I'm rooting for you!

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:53.049 position:50% align:center
But make sure this
is for yourself.

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:55.051 position:50% align:center
In the end, it's your dream.

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:57.679 position:50% align:center
So let's see it.

00:18:57.762 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Okay. I'll live my dream.

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:04.811 position:50% align:center
For my fans, for you,
but most of all...

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:07.022 position:50% align:center
...I'll do it for myself!

00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:08.898 position:50% align:center
Here we go!

00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:20.785 position:50% align:center
What the--?
It turned into a rabbit!

00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:22.203 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
Hit it.

00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:31.713 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN A]
It's go time!

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:33.298 position:50% align:center
[ALL cheering]

00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:36.509 position:50% align:center
[FANS]
Rabbit! Foot! Love! Whoo!

00:19:36.593 --> 00:19:40.638 position:50% align:center
Rabbit! Foot! Love! Whoo...!

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:43.933 position:50% align:center
This just got
ten times creepier.

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:45.477 position:50% align:center
Shout it loud!

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.312 position:50% align:center
I need to really hear
you to make my light

00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:49.564 position:50% align:center
the brightest it can be!

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:50.940 position:50% align:center
So the louder you shout,

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:52.859 position:50% align:center
the brighter you'll
make me shine!

00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:58.156 position:50% align:center
[FANS]
Rabbit! Foot! Love! Whoo!

00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:02.952 position:50% align:center
That's my cue!

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:07.332 position:50% align:center
The idol of freedom, Yuki Aoba,
will now grace you with a song!

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:12.420 position:50% align:center
[YUKI singing in Japanese]

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:18.593 position:50% align:center
[YUKI giggles]

00:20:18.677 --> 00:20:20.178 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Rabbit!

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:22.764 position:50% align:center
[MUSASHI]
The heck? What am I even seeing?

00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:25.392 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
An idol's live performance!

00:20:53.962 --> 00:20:55.547 position:50% align:center
Not today, pinky!

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:58.091 position:50% align:center
This is a battlefield,
not a concert hall!

00:20:58.174 --> 00:21:00.468 position:50% align:center
I'll teach you to play
around when you fight!

00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:01.970 position:50% align:center
She's not playing around!

00:21:02.053 --> 00:21:05.348 position:50% align:center
Idols give their heart and soul
every time they perform!

00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:16.860 position:50% align:center
[MUSASHI yells]

00:21:18.528 --> 00:21:20.030 position:50% align:center
Musashi, retreat.

00:21:20.113 --> 00:21:22.657 position:50% align:center
No, not yet!
This battle's not over!

00:21:22.741 --> 00:21:24.617 position:50% align:center
People are watching
this shameful display,

00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:27.245 position:50% align:center
so end it at once.

00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:31.708 position:50% align:center
Understood, sir.
All units, withdraw!

00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:44.304 position:50% align:center
Wow, that concert
wasn't too bad.

00:21:44.387 --> 00:21:48.058 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
But it wasn't enough.

00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:50.101 position:50% align:center
I'll sing there next time.

00:21:50.185 --> 00:21:53.938 position:50% align:center
I feel like I can if I have my
smooth-talkin' manager's help!

00:21:55.023 --> 00:21:57.734 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'll pencil you in.

00:22:02.864 --> 00:22:10.955 position:50% align:center
That jerk is the
worst. The worst!

00:23:46.384 --> 00:23:48.595 position:50% align:center
