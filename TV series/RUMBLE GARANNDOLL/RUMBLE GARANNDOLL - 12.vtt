00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:19.602 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.021 position:50% align:center
That's new.

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:24.524 position:50% align:center
Just where did this
ungodly power come from?

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:30.280 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
Unbelievable.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:32.615 position:50% align:center
Allow me to explain.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.493 position:50% align:center
You see, when a Garanndoll's
pilot has his passion synced up

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:38.496 position:50% align:center
with that of his battery girl's,
its power can skyrocket.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.207 position:50% align:center
Now that Shark One surpassed
its passion burst level,

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:46.463 position:50% align:center
it's assumed its true
form: The Burn Shark!

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:48.256 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Not good! Not good! Not good!

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.216 position:50% align:center
Calm down and tell me
why it's “not good"!

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.969 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] You should be freaking
out as much as me if not more!

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:56.431 position:50% align:center
Did you forget the damage we
caused? That horrid tragedy?

00:00:56.514 --> 00:00:57.724 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:01.311 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Is this really Shark One?

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:02.896 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Kinda feels like overkill.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.065 position:50% align:center
[MISA] You mean kinda
feels like cheating.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:07.150 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
You better not go berserk on me.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.944 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Berserk? That sounds
pretty exciting!

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:11.529 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Rin!

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:12.947 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI, RIN]
Huh?

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:17.744 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
It's that white dog again.

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:21.331 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE] So we meet
again, Arahabaki's Garann.

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:25.126 position:50% align:center
Or rather, should
I say... Rin Akagi?

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.171 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Is that you, Hayate?

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:29.923 position:50% align:center
You're the pilot of that Garann?

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:32.342 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
The time for talk is over!

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:45.980 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Just watch, you idealists.

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:47.899 position:50% align:center
The weight of your
own bloated dreams

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:51.611 position:50% align:center
is about to crush
your city into dust!

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:55.907 position:50% align:center
[ALL yelling]

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.951 position:50% align:center
Don't do this, Hayate!

00:01:58.034 --> 00:02:01.037 position:50% align:center
I'll stop the second
you surrender!

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:03.206 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR A] The Exhibition
Center will reach Akihabara

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.833 position:50% align:center
in 15 minutes!

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:06.835 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR B] If we don't wanna
risk enduring major damage,

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:08.795 position:50% align:center
we need to shoot
it down pronto!

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:11.006 position:50% align:center
The last line of
defense is right here.

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:12.507 position:50% align:center
You can bet your
last can of oden

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.634 position:50% align:center
we won't let them
reach the shore!

00:02:14.718 --> 00:02:15.760 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
This is an order!

00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:18.388 position:50% align:center
We have to eject
the battery by force!

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:20.807 position:50% align:center
Sir, no, we can't
obey that order!

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.559 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] If you don't,
we'll suffer damage

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:26.062 position:50% align:center
the likes you've
never seen before.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.690 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately,
the Asakusabashi incident

00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:31.443 position:50% align:center
is on the verge of
repeating itself.

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:36.698 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Mimi served as
a battery girl back then.

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:40.952 position:50% align:center
My battery girl. How young
and foolish we were.

00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:42.746 position:50% align:center
We fought a desperate
battle for the sake

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:43.955 position:50% align:center
of preserving our culture

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:48.126 position:50% align:center
and protecting the rest
of our crew, but...

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.337 position:50% align:center
Amidst the fires of war,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.965 position:50% align:center
we began to feel
the sparks of love.

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:59.012 position:50% align:center
And when we did,
our Garann turned blood red.

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:05.685 position:50% align:center
She doesn't wanna
talk, so fight!

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.645 position:50% align:center
Listen, just one day ago,

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:11.024 position:50% align:center
I was eating kebabs and taking
goofy pics with that pilot.

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:13.360 position:50% align:center
I know I can get through
to her if I try.

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.570 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
Enough of your nonsense!

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:19.032 position:50% align:center
[gasps] It's not nonsense!

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:21.284 position:50% align:center
Real talk? This red
Shark One is great,

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:23.119 position:50% align:center
but it burns energy
like, "whoa."

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:26.206 position:50% align:center
Let Rin catch her breath.
I can take it from here!

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:27.916 position:50% align:center
Take what?

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:35.382 position:50% align:center
You girls just tag-team
in this thing?

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:38.343 position:50% align:center
[FANS]
Love! Whoo! Rabbit! Foot...!

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:40.345 position:50% align:center
Let's get hoppin'.

00:03:40.428 --> 00:03:41.888 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
Prepare yourself!

00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:43.264 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Crap!

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:47.185 position:50% align:center
Uh! It changed
into a rabbit?!

00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:49.604 position:50% align:center
Whoever made this new
battery needs a big raise.

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:51.940 position:50% align:center
Blown away by my “bun”
of steel, aren't you?

00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:53.733 position:50% align:center
[YUKI laughs]

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:56.736 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Watch as I costume change
without missing a beat!

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.658 position:50% align:center
Time to take center stage!
Your idol has arrived!

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.660 position:50% align:center
Rabbit!

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:05.662 position:50% align:center
Uh, oopsie.

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:08.832 position:50% align:center
[YUKI screams]

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.501 position:50% align:center
Dumb bunny hopped right
into the line of fire.

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:14.212 position:50% align:center
Now's our chance!
Shoot it out of the sky!

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:16.464 position:50% align:center
--Retreat!
--Oh, screw that!

00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:19.801 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Rabbit Feet Assemble!

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:24.639 position:50% align:center
[RABBIT MECHS]
Rabbit! Foot! Love! Whoo!

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.933 position:50% align:center
Well played.

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:29.811 position:50% align:center
Thanks. They were all
just bursting with love.

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:33.314 position:50% align:center
[MUSASHI] All right, let's see
how you handle this!

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:34.441 position:50% align:center
[YUKI screams]

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:36.234 position:50% align:center
Not this lady!

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.742 position:50% align:center
'Kay. This kitty needs a
<i>kotatsu</i> , so here we go!

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:45.201 position:50% align:center
Meow.

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:52.834 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Let's cheat. Here, use this.

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:55.086 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Oh, okay.

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:01.301 position:50% align:center
[MISA, HOSOMICHI yelling]

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
How was I outmatched
by a cat and a table?

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.525 position:50% align:center
We need to put that dog down.

00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:19.778 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Hit the pause button.

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:21.529 position:50% align:center
I'm in need of a cat nap.

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:23.406 position:50% align:center
I wish dogs took naps.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.076 position:50% align:center
Bring the shark back now
so I can fight Rin!

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.869 position:50% align:center
And settle the score!

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:29.746 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Fine.
You heard her, Rin.

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.749 position:50% align:center
Hold your horses and sharks!
'Cause Shark One's off- limits!

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:34.250 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] And why the
hell's it off-limits?

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:37.253 position:50% align:center
I'm trying to save you from
repeating my mistake!

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:38.672 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
What mistake?

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:41.132 position:50% align:center
I told you before!
Back when I was a pilot.

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:42.801 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI gasps]

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:45.261 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
You're saying there's a chance

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.013 position:50% align:center
Shark One could explode?

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:47.972 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Can I say something?

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:49.516 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we got time.

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.017 position:50% align:center
[RIN] I'm not gonna
pretend like I know

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:54.646 position:50% align:center
what you're talking about,
because I honestly have no clue.

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.147 position:50% align:center
But I do know

00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:58.400 position:50% align:center
we'll regret it for the rest
of our lives if we give up!

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:01.736 position:50% align:center
And since I know Hayate,
I can't leave it like this!

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.321 position:50% align:center
[MISA, YUKI]
Yeah! No giving up!

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:05.198 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
I know, but...

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:07.325 position:50% align:center
Though I think I'll let
our trusty partner

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:08.618 position:50% align:center
have the final say.

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.120 position:50% align:center
We're a team!

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.497 position:50% align:center
And we need him for it to run
just as much as our will!

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.207 position:50% align:center
Rin.

00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:19.587 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI sighs]

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:22.048 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Sorry, Yamada.

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:23.800 position:50% align:center
I understand you concerns,

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:26.469 position:50% align:center
but I hope you understand I
can't disappoint them again.

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:27.887 position:50% align:center
Be rational!

00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:29.597 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
I would, but...

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:30.807 position:50% align:center
There's no rationalizing

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.059 position:50% align:center
when someone's silliness
just gels with you.

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:35.854 position:50% align:center
Silly mode, activate!

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:40.025 position:50% align:center
It's about to get
hella berserk out here!

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:42.902 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] So, uh, are you
gonna fight or talk?

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:46.865 position:50% align:center
Fight, but using my feelings.
My heart will be my blade!

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:49.242 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
Then let's see it!

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:50.702 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
You have to defeat the enemy

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:54.664 position:50% align:center
before you can persuade
them or get any items!

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:58.626 position:50% align:center
I can't just sit and watch!
Eject the battery unit!

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:05.050 position:50% align:center
If pushing the button's too
hard for you, then allow me!

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:06.384 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:13.058 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
Open your eyes, Yamada!

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:17.228 position:50% align:center
We're the adults now.
So please start acting like it!

00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:18.730 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:22.108 position:50% align:center
Because of things
you misunderstood,

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:24.069 position:50% align:center
your logic's skewed.

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:25.820 position:50% align:center
But deep down, you
know the real reason

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:27.781 position:50% align:center
the Garann exploded that day.

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:30.408 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure I follow.

00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:41.461 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Wow!

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:44.422 position:50% align:center
I've never seen passion
numbers run this high!

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:45.632 position:50% align:center
It might be dangerous,

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:48.218 position:50% align:center
but if we can increase
our energy output,

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:49.344 position:50% align:center
we could pull off the win

00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:51.554 position:50% align:center
by blasting 'em all
outta this world!

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:56.059 position:50% align:center
And, most importantly,
take back our future!

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.394 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
Right.

00:07:57.477 --> 00:08:00.939 position:50% align:center
Yours... and mine.
Let's save our future!

00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:05.735 position:50% align:center
Sure. Your future's so bright!

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:07.070 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:09.614 position:50% align:center
Yeah! 'Cause, um... your dream!

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:10.740 position:50% align:center
You won't achieve your dream

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:12.909 position:50% align:center
of being the world's
finest cosplayer!

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:14.869 position:50% align:center
So let's raise our
passion power to the max

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:15.995 position:50% align:center
and make that happen!

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:18.248 position:50% align:center
Your future is at stake!

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:21.209 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
Not "our" future?

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:30.135 position:50% align:center
--[CAP] You brushed her off?
--[MEGANE] Dirty coward!

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:31.136 position:50% align:center
[POCHA]
Poor Mimi.

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:32.262 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
You're the worst.

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:33.138 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
What's with all this commentary

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:34.597 position:50% align:center
from the peanut gallery?

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:36.474 position:50% align:center
Because I broadcasted that
exchange to the whole team?

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:37.851 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Next time, don't!

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:38.685 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
Yamada.

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:40.186 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.689 position:50% align:center
Now that I'm older, I can
better understand the dilemma

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:45.108 position:50% align:center
you were struggling
with way back then.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:48.028 position:50% align:center
You felt guilt over using
me as a battery girl.

00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:52.866 position:50% align:center
However, you also knew it
was your duty to fight.

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:55.201 position:50% align:center
I should've put my
duty first, too,

00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:57.412 position:50% align:center
but I instead chose
to confess my feelings

00:08:57.495 --> 00:09:00.540 position:50% align:center
at a very inopportune time.

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:03.335 position:50% align:center
That said, while we did
cause that explosion,

00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:05.587 position:50% align:center
it wasn't because the
passion either of us felt

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.756 position:50% align:center
transmutated the Garann.

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:09.132 position:50% align:center
We just weren't synced.

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:11.217 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't have moved so fast.

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:13.762 position:50% align:center
And you should've grown a
backbone and been honest!

00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:15.305 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.150 position:50% align:center
Just wondering, do you have a
thing for that Akatsuki guy?

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.069 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why are you wondering that?

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:30.653 position:50% align:center
Because I relate!

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:33.114 position:50% align:center
There's someone
that I like, too.

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:34.074 position:50% align:center
Rin.

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:35.200 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
But guess what,

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:37.410 position:50% align:center
our Garann runs on
all kinds of feels!

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:40.580 position:50% align:center
We have love for our hobbies.
Love for ourselves.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:42.832 position:50% align:center
And love for each other!

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:44.876 position:50% align:center
The love you feel is immoral.

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:46.252 position:50% align:center
How would you even know?

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:48.588 position:50% align:center
You can't classify things
like love and passion!

00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:50.131 position:50% align:center
Especially if it's not yours!

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:54.928 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I know you feel love.
So we won't deny yours either!

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:57.055 position:50% align:center
You and your army are the
only ones going around

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:59.349 position:50% align:center
rejecting what people
hold in their hearts.

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50% align:center
And if you don't stop...

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.770 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
...we'll make you!

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:06.356 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
I'd like to see you try!

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:16.032 position:50% align:center
Aw, yeah! We won the battle!

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:18.243 position:50% align:center
True, but we lost the war.

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:20.870 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:22.747 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Oh, no.

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:27.961 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Time's up. Game over.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.135 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
Captain! I'm so sorry. I failed.

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:36.594 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
No.

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:39.723 position:50% align:center
You were a successful decoy.
You can fall back for now.

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:42.434 position:50% align:center
I know that voice.
Akatsuki's in that bird.

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:44.811 position:50% align:center
Oh, boss fight.

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:49.441 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
We're rising?

00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:53.778 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] The higher something
is, the harder it falls.

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:56.031 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Checkmate, Garanndoll.

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:58.116 position:50% align:center
I intend to make
this the last time

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:01.202 position:50% align:center
we ever meet on
the field of battle.

00:11:09.753 --> 00:11:14.424 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] I won't lie.
You fought well for idealists.

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:18.928 position:50% align:center
So when I lay your bodies to
rest, I'll do so with respect!

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:20.555 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Don't make me laugh!

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:25.018 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] I may even
reconsider dropping this bomb!

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:27.103 position:50% align:center
The deciding factor for that

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:30.440 position:50% align:center
will be whether you
defeat me or not.

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:37.822 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Mimi, initiate an evacuation.

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:39.449 position:50% align:center
We're so close.

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:42.410 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
That's why I'm staying.

00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:46.706 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] You won't ask me
to stay by your side?

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.459 position:50% align:center
You and I have been
through a lot together.

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.169 position:50% align:center
And as awful as the consequences

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:53.755 position:50% align:center
of falling in love with
you wound up being,

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:56.591 position:50% align:center
I never once regretted it.

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:01.179 position:50% align:center
The young ones are
out there fighting

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:02.722 position:50% align:center
because we fought this long.

00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:05.850 position:50% align:center
It'd be wrong to abandon
ship when they need us.

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:08.269 position:50% align:center
After all, we know firsthand
how it's important

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:11.022 position:50% align:center
to have the support of others.

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:14.442 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI, RIN yell]

00:12:14.526 --> 00:12:16.486 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Hosomichi Kudo!

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center
You hardly know yourself,

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:20.448 position:50% align:center
yet you switch between women
at the drop of a hat.

00:12:20.532 --> 00:12:22.117 position:50% align:center
Are you as hollow
as your Garann?

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.120 position:50% align:center
Is there anything beneath
your metal plating and screws?

00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:27.789 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI, RIN scream]

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:30.333 position:50% align:center
That hurt!

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:32.419 position:50% align:center
There's no sting quite
like having the truth

00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
shoved in your face!

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:35.213 position:50% align:center
Yeah. He's spittin' facts.

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:36.172 position:50% align:center
Fatality.

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:38.425 position:50% align:center
Shut up!

00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:40.635 position:50% align:center
Okay, maybe I do
have a lot in common

00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:43.138 position:50% align:center
with the Garanndoll,
but so what?

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:45.515 position:50% align:center
This fish out of water
evolved thanks to the time

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:48.852 position:50% align:center
we've spent together and
the memories we've made!

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:52.856 position:50% align:center
And I'll kick your butt with
the strength that gives me!

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:55.275 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Let's do this!

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:56.276 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
You're still weak

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:58.987 position:50% align:center
no matter how much
you've evolved!

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.071 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Since this guy favors

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:02.032 position:50% align:center
being stupidly straightforward,

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:04.784 position:50% align:center
let's cut right to the chase
and play our trump card!

00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:06.327 position:50% align:center

[YUKI screams]

00:13:40.195 --> 00:13:41.738 position:50% align:center
Since you had all of
those festival treats,

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:44.449 position:50% align:center
I figured you were
overdue for some tricks!

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:46.576 position:50% align:center
You figured wrong!

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:47.869 position:50% align:center
There it is.

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:49.329 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Took long enough!

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:50.622 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Time to...

You lose.

My turn now! Rumble Punch!

00:14:14.104 --> 00:14:17.774 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] How can such a hollow
man summon such force?

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:21.569 position:50% align:center
[OPERATORS gasp]

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:27.117 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
I may be as empty as this robot,

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.744 position:50% align:center
but nobody said that
was a bad thing.

00:14:29.828 --> 00:14:31.413 position:50% align:center
It just means there's
plenty of room

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:33.164 position:50% align:center
for these girls'
passions to flow free

00:14:33.248 --> 00:14:35.792 position:50% align:center
to their heart's content.

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:38.294 position:50% align:center
And that's good enough for me.

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:42.173 position:50% align:center
[MIMI gasps]

00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:43.508 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] We're a little
low on those passions

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:44.551 position:50% align:center
at the moment, though.

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:46.428 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
I feel like jelly.

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:48.638 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Why can't we ever
stay cool till the end?

My, what a match.

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:56.271 position:50% align:center
What now?

00:14:56.354 --> 00:15:00.567 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] I'm a man of my word.
Suspend the operation.

--[OPERATORS gasp]
--[MIMI] What?

00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:09.451 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
What's the meaning of this?

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:12.037 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] What happened to
calling it off? I beat you!

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.413 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry to report this,

00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:15.707 position:50% align:center
but I've lost remote control
of the airships, sir.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.626 position:50% align:center
Our right to command them has
been revoked by the higher-ups.

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:22.088 position:50% align:center
Why would they revoke our
command at a time like this?

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:28.261 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] Seems like I've
fallen for more tricks.

00:15:28.345 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] We had victory
in the palm of our hand.

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:33.558 position:50% align:center
[MISA] Sorry. We need a
cooldown period to recharge.

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:35.060 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Maybe not.

00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
If Hosomichi's phone still has
"Zaburn Rumble," that is.

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:41.399 position:50% align:center
A few bars of that
will pep me right up.

Who're you trying to kid?

And even if you could power-up,

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:46.071 position:50% align:center
how exactly would
you stop a building

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:48.490 position:50% align:center
from falling out of the sky?

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:53.912 position:50% align:center
Thank you for helping
me see the truth.

00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:55.705 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for the
fool I've been.

Yamada.

00:15:57.457 --> 00:16:01.628 position:50% align:center
Let's go. For the city's sake.
For Arahabaki's sake, too.

00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:05.882 position:50% align:center
And, yes, for the sake of
our future together, Mimi!

00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:11.513 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] I spent some fun
days in this town. Really fun.

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:15.517 position:50% align:center
And I got served every slice
of passion pie there is.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.102 position:50% align:center
I genuinely wanted to protect it

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:20.522 position:50% align:center
as much as anyone else
in the rebellion.

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:24.984 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I...
I wasn't strong enough.

[BALZAC]
Don't lose heart, my boy!

00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:32.033 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:33.827 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] What matters now
is that I get through

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.537 position:50% align:center
to the youth within you!

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:40.208 position:50% align:center
Or rather, I get through to the
competent pilot of our Garann!

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:41.334 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hm?

00:16:41.418 --> 00:16:42.335 position:50% align:center
It's Yamada!

00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:43.503 position:50% align:center
--[HOSOMICHI] Huh?!
--[YUKI] No!

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:44.963 position:50% align:center
With new gear.

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:48.508 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Hosomichi, and our
dear, dear battery girls,

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:50.927 position:50% align:center
your hard-fought battle
and enthusiastic cries

00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:52.637 position:50% align:center
have touched our hearts!

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:55.265 position:50% align:center
Now it's time for us
to return that fervor.

00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:59.227 position:50% align:center
Because debts both great
and small should be repaid!

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.606 position:50% align:center
Arahabaki!

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:04.649 position:50% align:center
Okay.

[MIMI giggles]

00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:19.497 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] Even after all this time,
you never cease to amaze me.

00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:22.625 position:50% align:center
Which is amazing
in and of itself.

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:25.378 position:50% align:center
Guess who's joining
the shenanigans!

00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:26.921 position:50% align:center
Okay, guys!

00:17:27.005 --> 00:17:31.509 position:50% align:center
This nurse has a fever, and
the only cure is pedal power!

00:17:31.593 --> 00:17:34.179 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] We've set up speakers
throughout the city!

00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:36.890 position:50% align:center
We just need Yuki's lovely
voice to grace them!

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:40.560 position:50% align:center
Me? No way! I can't perform
a song I don't know!

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:42.520 position:50% align:center
Wait! I think I do know it!

00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:43.855 position:50% align:center
You, sure?

00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:45.732 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Yes, for she
subconsciously learned it

00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:49.361 position:50% align:center
thanks to the hypnopedia method
I used in the recharging room!

00:17:49.444 --> 00:17:50.820 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
When did you do that?!

00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:52.072 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Misa!

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:53.531 position:50% align:center
Use the backdoor code
to remove the limiter

00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:55.617 position:50% align:center
that prevents the
Garann from crashing!

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.911 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Ooh! A cheat code!

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.956 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR A] The remaining
airships are gone!

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.960 position:50% align:center
Impact is inevitable
if we don't act fast!

00:18:06.044 --> 00:18:09.297 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Then I suggest the four
of you wrap this up quickly.

00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:10.924 position:50% align:center
We've done all that we can!

00:18:11.007 --> 00:18:11.966 position:50% align:center
So, go!

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.301 position:50% align:center
But before you depart,

00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:15.470 position:50% align:center
know you aren't
alone in this fight.

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:17.972 position:50% align:center
We'll still be cheering
you on from here!

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:19.641 position:50% align:center
May our passion
resonate with yours

00:18:19.724 --> 00:18:22.519 position:50% align:center
so we can see the dawn
of a new day together!

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:26.439 position:50% align:center
What say you, Garanndoll?

00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:30.819 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Well, when you put
it like that... I say yeah!

00:18:30.902 --> 00:18:32.362 position:50% align:center
All systems go!

Uh! Thank you.

00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:15.113 position:50% align:center
I should be thanking you.

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:17.907 position:50% align:center
When you were talking to Hayate,
you said you liked someone.

00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:20.118 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right.

00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:21.703 position:50% align:center
Well, I do, too.

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:23.288 position:50% align:center
What?

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:26.249 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] I don't plan
to forgive my dad, ever.

00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:29.502 position:50% align:center
But at the same time, I can
recognize how awesome it is

00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:31.755 position:50% align:center
that his creation sparked
passion in someone's heart

00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:33.590 position:50% align:center
and gave her the strength
to move forward

00:19:33.673 --> 00:19:36.009 position:50% align:center
during a very trying time.

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:38.636 position:50% align:center
Just like me.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.473 position:50% align:center
People never truly forget
passion that strong.

00:19:41.556 --> 00:19:45.268 position:50% align:center
In fact, it's what kept me
going all these years later.

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:48.355 position:50% align:center
You helped me realize
it never faded away.

00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
So, thank you. I guess
that's all I wanted to say.

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:55.570 position:50% align:center
Oh, and well...

00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:58.073 position:50% align:center

I don't know when it happened,

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:10.710 position:50% align:center

to all of you.

Hosomichi.

00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:14.547 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Didn't expect that to
come out of your mouth.

00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:18.385 position:50% align:center
But if it's confession time,
I have one to make 'cause....

00:20:18.468 --> 00:20:22.055 position:50% align:center
...I love all of you, too!

00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:24.849 position:50% align:center
I think I kinda love
you guys, too.

"The Burn" level of passion
has been surpassed.

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:44.327 position:50% align:center
That's why it's
appropriately named

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:46.371 position:50% align:center
the Burn Shark Garann.

00:20:46.454 --> 00:20:48.373 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] Just how many final
forms does it have?

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:53.044 position:50% align:center

As True Countrymen, we must--

00:21:44.387 --> 00:21:48.683 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] You mean, like how
we did when you invaded us?

00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:52.520 position:50% align:center
However, I've found newcomers
make better allies than enemies.

[BALZAC] We derive our strength

If your world faces

That was fun.

00:22:42.195 --> 00:22:46.241 position:50% align:center
I think that's partially because
