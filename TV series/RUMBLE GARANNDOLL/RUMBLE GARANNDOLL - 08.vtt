We'll do a dungeon crawl next.

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:15.015 position:50% align:center
A dungeon crawl?

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:17.434 position:50% align:center
[MISA] If you can find and
secure what I'm looking for,

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:21.104 position:50% align:center
you'll successfully
clear the bonus stage.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:23.023 position:50% align:center
What was all that
"god" talk about?

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.900 position:50% align:center
I can't believe they've
forgotten the true gods.

What the heck?

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:45.295 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
Who knew it'd be this easy

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:48.882 position:50% align:center
to confiscate
Arahabaki's Garanndoll?

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:55.221 position:50% align:center
Why don't I get a bunny
to pulverize like Musashi?

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:57.807 position:50% align:center
I suppose it doesn't matter
what it looks like.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.935 position:50% align:center
I'm grinding it into
dust regardless!

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.982 position:50% align:center
What now? Oh, come on?

Uh! General Tanaka?

00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:52.714 position:50% align:center

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:56.509 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Negatory!

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:58.845 position:50% align:center
Remember the Nagata-cho
drop operation

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:00.972 position:50% align:center
that happened ten years ago?

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:03.600 position:50% align:center
If you did, you'd know basic
weapons are useless

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.102 position:50% align:center
against a True Army Garann.

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.313 position:50% align:center
That includes coasters!

[BALZAC]
Where?

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:27.248 position:50% align:center
Totally fine!
What an inspiration!

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:28.625 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
Uh...

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:30.710 position:50% align:center
It didn't defeat her,
but it did buy us some time.

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:33.755 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR A] Sir!
Shark One's form is fading!

00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:37.258 position:50% align:center

Right! On it!

Retrieval complete, Commander!

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.645 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
And the next girl's status?

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:50.271 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
they had the nerve...

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.774 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR A] She's fighting
with haters online!

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:55.068 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR B] Her passion meter's
plunged into the negatives!

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:56.903 position:50% align:center
She's entering the dark zone!

00:03:56.986 --> 00:03:58.697 position:50% align:center
Get off your phone, Yuki!

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.493 position:50% align:center
We're in trouble. What a time

This way.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center

This way.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.040 position:50% align:center
[OTAKU C]
Go faster.

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
[OTAKU D]
Faster.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:11.793 position:50% align:center

Almost there.

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center

Almost?

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:14.713 position:50% align:center

Yes.

[MISA]
Meow!

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:50.832 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Oh, man.
I thought I was gonna die!

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:53.460 position:50% align:center
Wait, Misa? Why're you here?

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:56.171 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
I, um, kinda had to be.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:59.299 position:50% align:center
The emergency release
is a stand-alone system.

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:02.010 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] So you braved
this maze by yourself?

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:04.512 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
No. Fortunately, I had guides.

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:06.639 position:50% align:center
[OTAKU gasping]

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:10.393 position:50% align:center

Option for the win.

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:12.687 position:50% align:center

How handy.

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:14.397 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:17.442 position:50% align:center
Well, guess you're my hero.

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:19.277 position:50% align:center
I owe ya one.

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:26.326 position:50% align:center
[MISA] We should go.
Everyone's waiting.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:27.744 position:50% align:center
[MISA yelping]

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.746 position:50% align:center
Where'd you even get this?

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.582 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'm not ready to leave.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:33.917 position:50% align:center
I've come this far,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.169 position:50% align:center
so might as well nab the
treasure for the princess.

00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:37.420 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Huh?

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:40.090 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] I put in too
much work for no payoff.

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:47.347 position:50% align:center
[OTAKU F]
I did it!

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.515 position:50% align:center
[OTAKU A]
Ahh.

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:49.724 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:51.226 position:50% align:center
Japanese men their
age should have

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:54.896 position:50% align:center
more respect for
themselves than that.

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:56.981 position:50% align:center
Illusory Country comrades.

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:59.275 position:50% align:center
Take off your masks
and open your eyes!

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.319 position:50% align:center
Your souls are
soiled with greed,

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:03.488 position:50% align:center
yet you're blind
to your own smut!

00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:06.574 position:50% align:center
So allow me to be the pristine
beacon that leads you goons

00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:08.868 position:50% align:center
out of the darkness
and into the light!

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:10.912 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Lemme stop ya right there!

00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:13.623 position:50% align:center
What? Who are you?

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:16.376 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Someone who knows
those weebs aren't lost.

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:18.586 position:50% align:center
They simply altered
their course!

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.839 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR A, MIMI gasp]

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:23.383 position:50% align:center
Hmph. What tripe are
you spouting off?

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:25.260 position:50% align:center
I saw it with my own two eyes.

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:28.596 position:50% align:center
They're all worms. They just
dig their underground holes.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.183 position:50% align:center
Indulging in antisocial
activities as they waste away.

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:34.019 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
They're our noble ancestors!

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:35.895 position:50% align:center
Brave warriors that were
resourceful enough

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:38.648 position:50% align:center
to preserve their LDs
in refrigerators!

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:40.942 position:50% align:center
Hmm... What's an "LD"?

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:42.402 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR A]
It's short for "laserdisc."

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:43.653 position:50% align:center
They were really big CDs

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:45.905 position:50% align:center
that had anime and movies
burned onto them.

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:47.866 position:50% align:center
"CDs"?

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:49.659 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
Heh. Leave it to an idealist

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:52.245 position:50% align:center
to glorify an
aggregation of ugliness.

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:54.831 position:50% align:center
People should stand under
the sun and embrace reality,

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:58.001 position:50% align:center
not lose themselves in an
illusion as dark as death.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.419 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
You're wrong!

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:03.173 position:50% align:center
And you know how I know?
We made an imperative discovery!

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:04.466 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:09.429 position:50% align:center
[OTAKU] We found something
beautiful! Come on!

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:10.805 position:50% align:center
Creepy.

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:12.932 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Did you hear our
souls sing out just now?

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:14.642 position:50% align:center
That's the song of dreamers!

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:17.896 position:50% align:center
Dreamers who continue to
dream thanks to Akihabara!

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:20.065 position:50% align:center
You say we're lost
in a sea of illusions,

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:22.942 position:50% align:center
but I say we're riding the
waves of our passions,

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:24.402 position:50% align:center
living our best lives!

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:26.696 position:50% align:center
Because this place
makes fantasies real!

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.865 position:50% align:center
Dreams can come true!

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:31.034 position:50% align:center
Akihabara is also
one of the five points

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:34.704 position:50% align:center
in Tokyo's
upside-down pentagram!

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:36.164 position:50% align:center
'Kay. Random.

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:39.042 position:50% align:center
I think this monologue is
just meant to sidetrack her.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:42.170 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? He's a dead man.

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:45.590 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
Continue.

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:48.218 position:50% align:center
No way! That lucky son of a gun.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:51.137 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] This world has a side
entirely shrouded in shadows,

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:52.847 position:50% align:center
which is why I don't
think "darkness"

00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:54.891 position:50% align:center
is something necessarily bad.

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:55.558 position:50% align:center
Take the seven...

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:57.435 position:50% align:center
Never mind that guy.

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:05.527 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
Hmm.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.404 position:50% align:center
So there's something
presently hidden in Tokyo

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:10.115 position:50% align:center
with special
spiritual protection.

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:13.743 position:50% align:center
But you have no idea
what that something is?

00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:16.162 position:50% align:center
I-I have some idea.

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:18.039 position:50% align:center
There's a chance it could
be an ancient weapon

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:20.458 position:50% align:center
or a horde of
horrifying demon gods.

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:24.295 position:50% align:center
There's also a possibility
it's a dragon or giant catfish.

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:26.297 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] So in summary,
just more drivel.

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:29.134 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Nuh-uh!

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:32.595 position:50% align:center
It could just be anything!

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.014 position:50% align:center
Like, what're the
commander's odds

00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:36.349 position:50% align:center
of getting this girl
to back down?

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:38.059 position:50% align:center
Lower than his IQ.

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:39.936 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR B groans]

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:46.568 position:50% align:center
It should be right over there.

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:48.319 position:50% align:center
Fourth one on the right.

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:51.072 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Feels good to feel accomplished.

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:53.241 position:50% align:center
Wait, what'd we gain
by coming here?

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:55.744 position:50% align:center
I don't even know
what this treasure is.

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:57.662 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Equipment for this system.

00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:59.205 position:50% align:center
It'll let us connect
two consoles

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:00.498 position:50% align:center
and play the same game together.

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:02.876 position:50% align:center
Oh. You're looking
for a link cable.

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.669 position:50% align:center
And it's pretty specific.

00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:06.921 position:50% align:center
But I thought if one still
existed, it'd be here.

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:09.966 position:50% align:center
[OTAKU D, OTAKU E]
One. Two. Three. Shoot!

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.384 position:50% align:center
[OTAKU D]
Rock beats scissors!

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:13.011 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] This is about
as old school as it gets.

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:14.637 position:50% align:center
Physically hooking
up two handhelds

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:16.765 position:50% align:center
'cause they're not
online compatible.

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:18.266 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Yeah.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.810 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] So you have to have
friends to play that game?

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:22.437 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Mh-hm.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.647 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Hm?

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:27.400 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] In conclusion,
Tokyo is a very spiritual place.

00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:28.943 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] You've concluded
that several times.

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:31.071 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Uh, did I mention
the school in Akihabara?

00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:32.447 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
Yes, you did.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.950 position:50% align:center
And one time, a satellite
fell out of the sky! Uh!

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:37.285 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
The only thing more absurd

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:38.661 position:50% align:center
than what you're
babbling on about

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.163 position:50% align:center
is that I actually
listened to it!

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:41.539 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC screams]

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:44.626 position:50% align:center
Time's up! Gotta bounce!

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:56.971 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
No! No!

00:09:57.055 --> 00:09:57.972 position:50% align:center
[MISA'S DAD chuckles]

00:09:58.056 --> 00:09:59.683 position:50% align:center
[MISA'S DAD]
Another win for me.

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:02.143 position:50% align:center
Whatcha thinkin', kitten?
You wanna go another round?

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:03.770 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:06.147 position:50% align:center
[MISA'S DAD] I'm surprised
you haven't gotten bored yet.

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:09.609 position:50% align:center
I feel like I'm making it less
fun by not holding back.

00:10:09.693 --> 00:10:10.944 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Mh-mh.

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:12.487 position:50% align:center
It's still fun.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.364 position:50% align:center
[MISA'S DAD]
Good to know.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:18.952 position:50% align:center
[MISA'S DAD] Okay. Just say
the word and we'll start!

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:21.496 position:50% align:center
You're goin' down this time.

00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:24.791 position:50% align:center
Bye. Be back soon.

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:26.876 position:50% align:center
Gotta go snag a copy of
the new black-market game

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.628 position:50% align:center
that just released.

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:30.338 position:50% align:center
Don't be gone too long.

00:10:30.422 --> 00:10:31.881 position:50% align:center
[MISA'S DAD]
I'll be fine.

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:34.134 position:50% align:center
I have lots of friends
looking out for me.

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:37.929 position:50% align:center
Some of which happen to be
from the Kasumigaseki district.

00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:39.806 position:50% align:center
See you when you get back.

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:41.599 position:50% align:center
That you will.

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:45.270 position:50% align:center
I promise I'll show you a trick
to the <i>Battle Gods</i> game later.

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:46.813 position:50% align:center
Sounds good to me.

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.481 position:50% align:center
[MISA'S DAD]
Thought it might.

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:55.321 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Sounds good.

00:10:58.158 --> 00:10:59.409 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
This announcement is for

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:00.618 position:50% align:center
all of our beloved Illusory
Country citizens...

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:03.663 position:50% align:center
[MISA] He made a promise
that he didn't keep.

00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:07.917 position:50% align:center
After that day,
he never came home again.

00:11:18.553 --> 00:11:20.013 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
I looked.

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:22.766 position:50% align:center
I looked everywhere for him.

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:31.733 position:50% align:center
[MISA] But no matter
where or what I searched,

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:34.819 position:50% align:center
I never got the result I wanted.

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:38.156 position:50% align:center
He was just gone.

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:42.202 position:50% align:center
Before I knew it,
I became a shut-in.

00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:46.039 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
I won't go outside. I can't go.

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:50.293 position:50% align:center
I wanna see my dad,
but I might disappear, too.

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:52.837 position:50% align:center
Wiped from existence.

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:57.676 position:50% align:center
I'm scared, Daddy. So scared.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:00.387 position:50% align:center
Please, come home.

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:03.223 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
It's okay.

00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:06.393 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't waste time getting
myself so worked up.

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:09.020 position:50% align:center
The NEET protection
law is no big deal.

00:12:09.104 --> 00:12:12.774 position:50% align:center
I have access to the dark
net. I can fool them.

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:15.026 position:50% align:center
And if a wolf does
come knocking,

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.947 position:50% align:center
I'll breathe easily knowing
my house is made of bricks.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.949 position:50% align:center
I can earn money, too.

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:26.454 position:50% align:center
I can live on deliveries.
I do have a fondness for boxes.

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:33.044 position:50% align:center
[MISA] So, it's fine.
I'm doing fine, Daddy.

00:12:33.128 --> 00:12:37.549 position:50% align:center
Everything's fine. I promise.

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:39.426 position:50% align:center
[banging]

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:42.804 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Who's there? What's going on?

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:43.596 position:50% align:center
[UKAI yells]

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.764 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:47.392 position:50% align:center
[UKAI] You're one
elusive kid, you know.

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:50.270 position:50% align:center
But now that I've found you,
I'm taking you into custody.

00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:52.230 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
No!

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:54.983 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
In the end, I wasn't fine.

00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:59.446 position:50% align:center
My straw house came tumbling
down with a single gust.

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:03.700 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Daddy?

00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:07.620 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Hm?

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:09.581 position:50% align:center
Good. You're awake.

00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:13.209 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] That cave-in
got a little too exciting

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:14.794 position:50% align:center
and you passed out.

00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:17.047 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
You carried me all this way?

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.256 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] What kind
of knight up and leaves

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.758 position:50% align:center
his princess to rot?

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:20.675 position:50% align:center
[MISA grunts]

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:25.263 position:50% align:center
Huh? Glad you're okay.

00:13:25.347 --> 00:13:27.098 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI grunts]

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:33.146 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
She's targeting the dungeon.

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:36.232 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Or just doing
whatever the heck she wants.

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:41.529 position:50% align:center
Hosomichi. Do you think she'll
succeed in taking Akihabara?

00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:45.033 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
If we just watch? Yeah.

00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:50.163 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Then let's board the Garann.

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:51.873 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you sure?

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:55.877 position:50% align:center
[MISA] Positive. I'm tired
of cowering in a box.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.214 position:50% align:center
I can fight,
so that's what I'll do.

00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:05.720 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
What's this?

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:19.192 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Meow.

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:22.779 position:50% align:center
That robot went from being a
fish to a rabbit to a cat?

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:25.198 position:50% align:center
It's like a whole petting zoo.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:30.161 position:50% align:center
Umm, Misa, the heck'd
you do the cockpit?

00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:33.164 position:50% align:center
I just gave it a <i>kotatsu</i> .
Like the recharging room's.

00:14:33.248 --> 00:14:37.252 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why? Because it's
so warm and cozy?

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:44.551 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Let's win this and
get back to the real <i>kotatsu</i> .

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:46.678 position:50% align:center
Garanndoll, activate!

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:48.596 position:50% align:center
Cat Three!

00:14:54.853 --> 00:14:57.022 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] Know what you have
in common with the fish?

00:14:57.105 --> 00:14:58.773 position:50% align:center
You're a lightweight!

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:03.361 position:50% align:center
Okay then.

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:07.407 position:50% align:center
Nyan Knuckle!

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.576 position:50% align:center
No!

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:17.584 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Uh! That girl.

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:21.296 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] Actually, you are
different from that shark.

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:26.051 position:50% align:center
Your heart's not in
this fight, I can tell.

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:27.427 position:50% align:center
[MISA gasps]

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:33.099 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] You're the type to
ignore the devastation you see

00:15:33.183 --> 00:15:35.185 position:50% align:center
if it makes you uncomfortable.

00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:36.895 position:50% align:center
You hide away from
the rest of the world

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:40.190 position:50% align:center
and drown in an
ocean of fantasies.

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:43.860 position:50% align:center
Failures like you are
even worse than losers.

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:46.112 position:50% align:center
Come out, scaredy-cat.

00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:50.575 position:50% align:center
If you don't, I'll just
have to come to you.

00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:56.122 position:50% align:center
[MISA] I'm less powerful
than Shark One,

00:15:56.206 --> 00:15:58.249 position:50% align:center
much slower than Rabbit Two,

00:15:58.333 --> 00:16:02.545 position:50% align:center
and my armor is the
weakest out of all three.

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:06.716 position:50% align:center
What was I thinking?
This unit's useless!

00:16:08.802 --> 00:16:11.513 position:50% align:center
[MISA] But maybe I can
still force a draw.

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:13.682 position:50% align:center
If I get close enough to
self-destruct, I could--

00:16:13.765 --> 00:16:16.059 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Misa, stop.

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:18.645 position:50% align:center
You don't have to fight
if you don't want to.

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:19.771 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
But--

00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:23.108 position:50% align:center
Come on. You're a
pro shut-in, right?

00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:24.484 position:50% align:center
Being out in the open,

00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:28.697 position:50% align:center
calling attention to yourself
just isn't your scene.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.240 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
No!

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:33.368 position:50% align:center
Even so, the other girls can't
power the Garanndoll right now.

00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:35.912 position:50% align:center
I have to do this
for their sake, too!

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.205 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
That's a pretty grownup thing

00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:39.332 position:50% align:center
for a kid to stress over.

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:41.918 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
I swear.

00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:43.461 position:50% align:center
Aren't hackers
supposed to be smart,

00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:44.587 position:50% align:center
or are you an exception?

00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:48.425 position:50% align:center
I'm exceptional!
Most of the time...

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:49.634 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Then it must've been an off day

00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:52.220 position:50% align:center
since you couldn't even
find your treasure.

00:16:52.303 --> 00:16:54.014 position:50% align:center
[MISA gasps]

00:16:54.097 --> 00:16:57.392 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
The link cable, you got it?

00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:59.561 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
At the very last second.

00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:01.438 position:50% align:center
So don't go saying
this unit's useless

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.690 position:50% align:center
because I'm a part of it, too.

00:17:03.773 --> 00:17:06.985 position:50% align:center
I'll make up for
whatever you lack.

00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:09.029 position:50% align:center
We still have a fighting chance.

00:17:09.112 --> 00:17:13.116 position:50% align:center
Now let's get this cat in gear
and turn the tides--together.

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:15.076 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Together?

00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:23.960 position:50% align:center
[MISA yells]

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:25.628 position:50% align:center
[MISA] If you had it in your
pocket this whole time,

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:27.922 position:50% align:center
then why didn't you
tell me sooner?

00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:32.677 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR A] Her passion
meter is rising fast!

00:17:32.761 --> 00:17:33.803 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR B]
And a piece of machinery

00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:35.513 position:50% align:center
just appeared out of thin air!

00:17:35.597 --> 00:17:38.767 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] What? Is it part
of the Garanndoll?

00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:42.812 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Oh, no. A table.

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:45.315 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
Reinforcements?

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:46.983 position:50% align:center
Okay, communicate
with your pilot!

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:49.736 position:50% align:center
Explain what you're doing
before you give me a seizure!

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:50.945 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
We're moving out!

00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:52.238 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Huh?!

00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:04.376 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
We've been boxed up?

00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:06.753 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
This is Cat Three's Power Mode.

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:09.255 position:50% align:center
Since when does this
thing have modes?

00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:11.174 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Cat Three...

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
...CT2!

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:17.013 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
What's that stand for?

00:18:17.097 --> 00:18:18.306 position:50% align:center
Oh, you mean like " <i>kotatsu</i> "

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.725 position:50% align:center
because the mech hid
under a giant table.

00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:23.978 position:50% align:center
Why is our power being amped
up by a piece of furniture?

00:18:24.062 --> 00:18:27.607 position:50% align:center
Hey, uh, Misa? You there?

00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:28.483 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
'Sup?

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:29.818 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI yelps]

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.493 position:50% align:center
Roger that. I'm a comin'.

00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
Okay. Cool.
Now I'm ready to play.

00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:46.751 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Let the game begin!

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:49.963 position:50% align:center
You finally got the courage
to show me your true form.

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:52.632 position:50% align:center
Not bad, scaredy-cat!

00:18:52.716 --> 00:18:54.009 position:50% align:center
That a direct hit?

00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:56.011 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but we're fine!

00:18:58.805 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
Gamers and their
dirty OP tricks.

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:03.727 position:50% align:center
Classic <i>kotatsu</i> maneuver!
Blankets don't shoot blanks!

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.812 position:50% align:center
I'm almost surprised
to see you alive.

00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:07.814 position:50% align:center
Why is that surprising?

00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:11.985 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Meow!

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:13.862 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO grunts]

00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:15.196 position:50% align:center
Despite your yellow belly,

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.407 position:50% align:center
it seems someone's decided
to stop running away

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.117 position:50% align:center
and face me head on.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.996 position:50% align:center
If you want to duel me that
badly, I'll just have to oblige.

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:24.998 position:50% align:center
It's only right!

00:19:28.043 --> 00:19:29.127 position:50% align:center
Brace yourself!

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.629 position:50% align:center
Nothing's stopping me now.

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:44.142 position:50% align:center
How many transformations is
this thing gonna go through?

00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:46.061 position:50% align:center
As many as it takes
to crush her!

00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:48.313 position:50% align:center
Die, fools!

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:51.733 position:50% align:center
Time to get real!

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:56.946 position:50% align:center
C'mon! Help me!

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.448 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:20:11.503 --> 00:20:13.880 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:18.802 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI, MISA yelling]

00:20:18.885 --> 00:20:24.641 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] Such an intense attack.
How fascinating!

00:20:33.274 --> 00:20:35.360 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:36.444 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
We won!

00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:38.571 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Game over!

00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:47.747 position:50% align:center
A shark, a rabbit,
and now a cat.

00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:50.291 position:50% align:center
What a ragtag team.

00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:51.751 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
She ran away?!

00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:53.378 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] I see this as
more along the lines

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:55.338 position:50% align:center
of her being kind
enough to retreat.

00:20:55.422 --> 00:20:57.716 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] There was a crane
hiding in the turtle.

00:20:57.799 --> 00:20:59.467 position:50% align:center
That makes it crurtle.

00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:00.677 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
Uh, no.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:05.223 position:50% align:center
[OTAKU chattering]

00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:07.892 position:50% align:center
Damn. What'd I miss, guys?

00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:19.904 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
This fanbook is amazing!

00:21:19.988 --> 00:21:22.949 position:50% align:center
It even has the costume designs
for the legendary second season!

00:21:23.033 --> 00:21:24.701 position:50% align:center
Oh, yay. So stoked for you.

00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:25.869 position:50% align:center
It also has visual references...

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:26.953 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
So Cat Three clawed its way

00:21:27.037 --> 00:21:29.581 position:50% align:center
to being a powerhouse after all.

00:21:29.664 --> 00:21:31.207 position:50% align:center
Turns out it has
a better defense

00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:32.959 position:50% align:center
than the other two units.

00:21:33.043 --> 00:21:34.336 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I believe it.

00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:37.005 position:50% align:center
But it's pretty average
as far as robots go.

00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:38.423 position:50% align:center
Its movement is limited,

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:41.384 position:50% align:center
and it can't fight at
close-range to save its life.

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:47.557 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking. We should
let the other girls in.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.143 position:50% align:center
Huh? Do you know
what you're saying?

00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:51.436 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Mm-hmm.

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:54.522 position:50% align:center
I'll be all right as long
as you play with me.

00:21:56.733 --> 00:21:59.319 position:50% align:center
I think they made a
phone version of this one.

00:21:59.402 --> 00:22:02.614 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but I'm better with
the handheld controls.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.661 position:50% align:center
You ready for a fight?
You won't beat me this time.

00:23:46.343 --> 00:23:47.218 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Next Time! "The

00:23:47.302 --> 00:23:48.345 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Hilarious!

00:23:48.428 --> 00:23:50.013 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Akiba Apocalypse Revelation!"
