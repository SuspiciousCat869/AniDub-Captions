[MUNAKATA] If we pawn this
thing off on the True Army,

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.480 position:50% align:center
I can open another shop.

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:24.899 position:50% align:center
Then we'll be just like we were.

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:28.028 position:50% align:center
Right, Hosomichi?

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:33.366 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Is my life really
about to go down the drain?

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.538 position:50% align:center
No! Not if you and I join forces
and turn the tables on our foes!

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:41.453 position:50% align:center
[ALL chattering]

00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:46.458 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasping]

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:47.667 position:50% align:center
Who is that?

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:49.169 position:50% align:center
She came out of her shell.

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:51.588 position:50% align:center
This whole time she's been
inside General Tanaka?!

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:52.797 position:50% align:center
Um, phrasing?

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:53.965 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC chuckles]

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.884 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Allow me to introduce

00:02:55.967 --> 00:03:00.930 position:50% align:center
Arahabaki's awe-inspiring
general: Nastassja Tanaka!

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:02.807 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you.

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:05.060 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hold the mother-flippin' phone!

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:07.228 position:50% align:center
Our general's a little girl?

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:10.315 position:50% align:center
Yes. That's why I kept
my identity a secret.

00:03:10.398 --> 00:03:11.649 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
That makes sense.

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.360 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
None of this makes sense!

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:16.529 position:50% align:center
Nice timing! The dramatic
effect was spot on!

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:18.698 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I do what I can.

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:20.950 position:50% align:center
Both cut from the same cloth.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.494 position:50% align:center
Is she for real?

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:25.622 position:50% align:center
Though this may seem like
a joke, it's all true.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:27.624 position:50% align:center
You know, the ol'
"looks like a kid,

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:29.459 position:50% align:center
but's really way older" thing.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:32.087 position:50% align:center
[RESISTANCE]
Tanaka! Tanaka! Tanaka...!

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.505 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Oh.

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:36.549 position:50% align:center
She shows her cute face
and suddenly everyone's back.

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.510 position:50% align:center
No girl should have such power.

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:40.428 position:50% align:center
It's not fair!

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:42.806 position:50% align:center
[RESISTANCE]
Alley-oop! Here we go!

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.307 position:50% align:center
Left. Left. Left, right, left.

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:45.809 position:50% align:center
Hold up, guys.

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:47.143 position:50% align:center
I'll be leaving you now.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.770 position:50% align:center
I have to go prepare
the Revolver

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:50.980 position:50% align:center
for our upcoming battle.

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:54.901 position:50% align:center
Our final trump card
is about to be played.

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:56.861 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you three
to make our enemy fold

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:58.113 position:50% align:center
and bring us victory.

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:01.324 position:50% align:center
[RESISTANCE]
Left. Left. Left, right, left...

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:03.076 position:50% align:center
[TANAKA]
Onward.

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.455 position:50% align:center
[RESISTANCE]
Left. Left. Left, right, left...

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.294 position:50% align:center
[crash]

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:22.303 position:50% align:center
They'll run, right? They're
not crazy enough to stay.

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:25.515 position:50% align:center
They'll definitely scram.
Without a doubt.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center
I mean, we took their
primary weapon.

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:33.398 position:50% align:center
It'd be plain stupid to stay.
Pointless with a capital "P."

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:37.569 position:50% align:center
In a way, we're saving
their asses by doing this.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:43.950 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA] You don't want
your little lady friends

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:46.327 position:50% align:center
to get hurt, do you?

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:48.455 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Right.

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:51.583 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:59.007 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Hey, put your phone on silent.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.468 position:50% align:center
It's pissing me off.

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.261 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Okay.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:10.643 position:50% align:center
I swear, what is it
with you and that song?

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:13.355 position:50% align:center
Zaba-daba-doo or whatever.

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:26.326 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Whoa.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.661 position:50% align:center
So, your dad was a
bigshot TV producer?

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.622 position:50% align:center
Color me shocked.

00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:33.583 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
It's been ages,

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:36.086 position:50% align:center
but the only time I can
remember him smiling

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.005 position:50% align:center
was when I complimented <i>Zaburn</i> .

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:41.883 position:50% align:center
Then eventually the
series was canned.

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:45.303 position:50% align:center
That was it. All that
work for nothing.

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:47.555 position:50% align:center
Why, though?

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.267 position:50% align:center
Don't know, don't
care. Just was.

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:52.727 position:50% align:center
Some said it was
because the show

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:55.355 position:50% align:center
just didn't appeal to the
right generation of viewers.

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:58.441 position:50% align:center
They might have been
onto something there.

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:00.068 position:50% align:center
The day my dad went missing,

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:02.153 position:50% align:center
he left me with
these parting words:

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:04.906 position:50% align:center
" <i>Zaburn</i> was a failure."

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:08.785 position:50% align:center
Then he walked out
of my life forever.

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:10.370 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe
such a failure

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:13.164 position:50% align:center
got a hardcore fan like Rin.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.793 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
She is a weird one.

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:20.588 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA] Hm. Then why don't
you change your ringtone?

00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:23.925 position:50% align:center
Sounds like it grates your
ears as much as mine.

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:25.427 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
My battery died,

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.263 position:50% align:center
so you won't have to
hear it anytime soon.

00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:36.104 position:50% align:center
[REPORTER A]
And there it is!

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:39.190 position:50% align:center
Just as Captain Akatsuki of the
True Army declared yesterday,

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:43.611 position:50% align:center
the Exhibition Center is being
moved to Akihabara by airship.

00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:44.863 position:50% align:center
Will he actually drop
the massive building...

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:46.573 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Ugh. If you're about to say,

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:49.242 position:50% align:center
"We're going back," don't.

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:50.618 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI sighs]

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:52.370 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Roger that.

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:58.126 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA] You can start over
in Kitashinchi or Nishikicho.

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:01.421 position:50% align:center
Handsome guy like you will
make headway, no prob.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.631 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
What's a shell of a man

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:05.759 position:50% align:center
need to make headway for anyway?

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:07.469 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA groans]

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:11.222 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Quick question.

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:12.807 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Huh?

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:14.225 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Did I ever tell you

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:17.020 position:50% align:center
how I got this lovely
scar above my eye?

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:21.399 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Um. No.
I don't think you have.

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:23.902 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
It was a cat.

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:25.195 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
A cat?

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.113 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Yeah. It scratched me.

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:28.615 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
That's pretty lame.

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:29.991 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Dude, shut up!

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:32.660 position:50% align:center
There's nothing lame
about caring for strays.

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:35.872 position:50% align:center
But despite the fact I fed
and pet this cheeky little guy,

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:38.875 position:50% align:center
he never warmed up to me,
let alone listened to me.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
Nyarome always acted
like his own boss.

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:44.130 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
This story have a purpose?

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:50.303 position:50% align:center
One day, he meandered out of
my sight and got hit by a car.

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:57.268 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA] The scar he gave me
tends to throb when I see you.

00:07:57.352 --> 00:08:02.190 position:50% align:center
So, don't go wandering off.
Okay, Hosomichi?

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:05.985 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Why the hell isn't he answering?

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:07.445 position:50% align:center
And you know he's
ignoring us on purpose

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:09.155 position:50% align:center
'cause it goes straight
to voicemail!

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:11.241 position:50% align:center
Screw that dumb jerk
with sandpaper!

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:14.160 position:50% align:center
Can't believe I made
him my manager!

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:23.044 position:50% align:center
[RIN] He never finished.
I guess he lied about that, too.

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:24.254 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:28.591 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
He made Zaburn... red.

00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:33.471 position:50% align:center
Wait, does that mean
what I think it means?

00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:36.891 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Rin, prepare for the worst!

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:41.187 position:50% align:center
Rin?

00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:43.857 position:50% align:center
Hosomichi will come back to us.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.026 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I'd like to think so, too,

00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:49.571 position:50% align:center
but considering the
circumstances...

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:54.075 position:50% align:center
Look, Yuki, it's painted red.
Hosomichi made it red!

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:57.162 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Cool? But does it matter
what color he painted it?

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:59.414 position:50% align:center
Oh, you better believe it!

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:01.249 position:50% align:center
Okay, you lost me.

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:04.127 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Check this out!

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.172 position:50% align:center
Zaburn Red! You get it?

00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:11.009 position:50% align:center
This was a version planned for
the canceled second season!

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:12.886 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I still don't follow.

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:15.388 position:50% align:center
I kinda forgot about
it up till now.

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:19.517 position:50% align:center
I first saw him in red a little
before I got that fan book.

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:23.980 position:50% align:center
I saw it back when Hosomichi
dove into my mind.

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:27.275 position:50% align:center
This proves there's another
side to him he keeps hidden.

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:30.195 position:50% align:center
Still waters run deep!

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:32.530 position:50% align:center
He wouldn't've been holding
the legendary Zaburn Red

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:34.366 position:50% align:center
if they didn't!

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.410 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
He still loves <i>Zaburn</i> !

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:40.872 position:50% align:center
He plays it off like he doesn't
on the surface, but he does!

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:43.041 position:50% align:center
Because he likes red?

00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:45.085 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Because the red version
never made it to air,

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:47.545 position:50% align:center
but he still painted it!

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:53.343 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Okay.

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.429 position:50% align:center
You know, the whole world
could turn their back on him,

00:09:56.513 --> 00:09:58.306 position:50% align:center
but not you.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.267 position:50% align:center
You have just as
much faith in him!

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:04.729 position:50% align:center
You are a stubborn
little one, arent you?

00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:06.147 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:07.941 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:11.152 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Misa, you know there's a door.

00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:13.655 position:50% align:center
It's a no-go.
Nothing but static.

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:15.073 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Well, duh.

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:18.118 position:50% align:center
He'd never answer that if he's
not answering his phone.

00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:21.871 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
You can't just ghost people.

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:25.083 position:50% align:center
It's rude and against the rules.

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:26.876 position:50% align:center
What're you up to now?

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.712 position:50% align:center
Venting all of my anger.

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:30.714 position:50% align:center
Cutting me off doesn't
mean shutting me out.

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:32.465 position:50% align:center
I'll hit 'im with
something else.

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:34.009 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I'm sorry, what?

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:36.678 position:50% align:center
The aircrafts are moving forward
with engines at full speed.

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:40.056 position:50% align:center
It doesn't appear they show
any signs of-- W-Wait!

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.808 position:50% align:center
Not again!

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:44.477 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] Did you just
hijack the broadcast?!

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.865 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Testing. Testing.
Can you hear me?

00:10:56.948 --> 00:10:59.242 position:50% align:center
Awesome! What's hoppin'in?

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:02.078 position:50% align:center
Your favorite rebellious idol
is coming to you live!

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:04.414 position:50% align:center
Yuki Aoba, here!

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:07.000 position:50% align:center
As you all know, a lot of
unhoppy things are going on

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:09.878 position:50% align:center
with Arahabaki at the moment.

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:12.630 position:50% align:center
However, we will hold
fast to our ideals

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:15.925 position:50% align:center
and resist our enemies
until the furry end!

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:18.219 position:50% align:center
You can't silence us
with censorship!

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:20.180 position:50% align:center
You can't steal our culture!

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:24.059 position:50% align:center
We'll fight you loud 'n' proud
till the day we die! Jerks!

00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:26.728 position:50% align:center
Yuki.

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:29.272 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I mean, if we simply took
this suppression lying down,

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:31.566 position:50% align:center
then poof, there goes
Japan's last defense

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:33.234 position:50% align:center
for a future that doesn't suck!

00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:34.194 position:50% align:center
[RESISTANCE]
Yeah! That's right!

00:11:34.277 --> 00:11:36.696 position:50% align:center
Turn that thing off now.

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:41.284 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] All Garanndoll
pilots stay tuned!

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:44.371 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Hosomichi? Are you listening?

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:48.124 position:50% align:center
Well, I hope you are, because
I have a question for you!

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:49.376 position:50% align:center
This is what you want?

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:53.046 position:50% align:center
For the story you wrote
with us to end this way?

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:55.340 position:50% align:center
I, for one, want a rewrite!

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:58.009 position:50% align:center
One that's true to the
person you really are.

00:11:58.093 --> 00:12:00.387 position:50% align:center
The person who makes my
heart explode with passion

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.263 position:50% align:center
just by being around me!

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:03.848 position:50% align:center
And I'm not the only one!

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:07.102 position:50% align:center
Everyone at Arahabaki
feels the same!

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:09.354 position:50% align:center
Yes, you helped win our battles,

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:12.857 position:50% align:center
but you also made our
days way more fun.

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:17.070 position:50% align:center
So, I can't even
entertain the idea

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:20.281 position:50% align:center
that all the time we spent
together meant nothing to you.

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:21.908 position:50% align:center
I refuse to believe
you didn't feel

00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:25.245 position:50% align:center
a single shred of
compassion for us.

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:30.583 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
You hear me?

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:34.504 position:50% align:center
I said I don't believe it!
Not for a second!

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.756 position:50% align:center
No! Idiot! They'll see!

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.926 position:50% align:center
Right now, if you're
listening to this,

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.470 position:50% align:center
and you know you felt
that spark of passion,

00:12:42.554 --> 00:12:46.349 position:50% align:center
and you know Arahabaki is
what helped fan that fire,

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:48.268 position:50% align:center
then you know you owe us.

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:51.271 position:50% align:center
So, you better
come'n pay us back.

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:58.987 position:50% align:center
Please come back to me.

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:06.161 position:50% align:center
[MISA] Look, jerk,
I need my Player 2.

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:08.371 position:50% align:center
How can we game if
you're off the grid?

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:11.041 position:50% align:center
Over and out.

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:12.584 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Misa.

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:16.171 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA] Ugh. Don't go getting
any funny ideas, Hosomichi.

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:18.548 position:50% align:center
All they want is their
robot and pilot back.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:19.966 position:50% align:center
If you couldn't
operate that thing,

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.511 position:50% align:center
they wouldn't give a crap
about where you went.

00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:25.889 position:50% align:center
And what was that about
"paying them back"?

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:27.724 position:50% align:center
Psh, bunch of BS.

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:29.100 position:50% align:center
They act all buddy-buddy,

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:31.227 position:50% align:center
but they'd betray us as soon
as the going gets tough,

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:34.064 position:50% align:center
which is why we don't
owe anyone anything!

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:37.025 position:50% align:center
That's as true now as it
was before we met them.

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:38.943 position:50% align:center
Am I right?

00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:46.284 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Am I right?

00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:47.660 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:50.246 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to answer
me within three seconds!

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.706 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA growls]

00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:58.463 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICH, MUNAKATA gasp]

00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:07.138 position:50% align:center
Huh? What the--? The damn
robot can move on its own?

00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:10.642 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI gasps, grunts]

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:12.602 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Wait, stop!

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:30.453 position:50% align:center
What? You're going
back? Seriously?

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:34.332 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, man. I really am.

00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:37.752 position:50% align:center
It's just... my shell's
been empty for years.

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:40.964 position:50% align:center
Hollow. Nothing left to give.

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:46.261 position:50% align:center
But Arahabaki was able
to fill the void inside.

00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:50.390 position:50% align:center
They all shared their
passion with me.

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:09.075 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Hey!

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:18.501 position:50% align:center
Dumb. You are so dumb!

00:15:20.003 --> 00:15:21.713 position:50% align:center
Jeez.

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:23.298 position:50% align:center
And this, Hosomichi,

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:27.052 position:50% align:center
is why you'll forever be
the reigning king of debt.

00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:40.440 position:50% align:center
[MUSASHI] A city filled to the
brim with the sins of man.

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:44.944 position:50% align:center
If I'm being honest, can't say
that I hate such a place.

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:55.580 position:50% align:center
[whistle blowing]

00:16:00.502 --> 00:16:02.921 position:50% align:center
[MEGANE]
She's, uh, really harsh!

00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:06.841 position:50% align:center
[POCHA] I know! If only
she weren't so damn cute!

00:16:06.925 --> 00:16:09.219 position:50% align:center
You need to pedal harder.

00:16:10.762 --> 00:16:13.556 position:50% align:center
[RESISTANCE]
So damn cute!

00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:17.811 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Be honest, General.

00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:20.772 position:50% align:center
Do you think he'll have a
change of heart and return?

00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:22.399 position:50% align:center
All we can really do
are the duties

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
that are within our
power to carry out.

00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:30.031 position:50% align:center
[TANAKA] Prepare for the worst,
and hope for the best.

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:39.749 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Shit! Go faster!

00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:48.258 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR A]
They're three kilometers away!

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:52.554 position:50% align:center
Look, Mimi, if things
get bad, you get gone.

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:54.305 position:50% align:center

Yamada.

[alarm dings]

00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:57.934 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR A]
There's a new signal! Uh!

00:16:58.018 --> 00:17:01.229 position:50% align:center
It's the Garanndoll!
And it's heading this way!

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:02.397 position:50% align:center
He's here!

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.649 position:50% align:center
Have you finished
with the preparations?

00:17:04.733 --> 00:17:08.111 position:50% align:center
[TANAKA] We're all set.
Ready when you are.

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:10.488 position:50% align:center
Hosomichi came back
to us after all!

00:17:10.572 --> 00:17:12.490 position:50% align:center
Great, so if he hustles
and comes to us,

00:17:12.574 --> 00:17:14.617 position:50% align:center
we don't even have to
use this thing, right?

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:16.661 position:50% align:center
It's so much more
exciting this way!

00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:18.496 position:50% align:center
Roller coasters,
the original side-scroller.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.165 position:50% align:center
We're at war, not an
amusement park!

00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:22.417 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.046 position:50% align:center

Move it or lose it!

[MUSASHI]
How'd you get behind us?

00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:36.014 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Rin! Yuki! Misa!

00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:39.434 position:50% align:center
Can you hear me? I was wrong!

00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:47.317 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] Calm down. It's
embarrassing how loud you are.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.443 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Mimi!

00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:49.819 position:50% align:center
We're sending the
battery unit to you,

00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:51.863 position:50% align:center
so just stay right
where you are.

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:54.491 position:50% align:center
You should be apologizing
in person anyway.

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:55.700 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
What?

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:59.496 position:50% align:center
It's time, General!
Go! Revolver Battery!

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.414 position:50% align:center

[HOSOMICHI]
Huh?

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.554 position:50% align:center
Don't you know it's
rude to neglect a lady?

00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:18.682 position:50% align:center
Or do you just not
have any manners?

00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:19.474 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Get off!

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:22.227 position:50% align:center
And let you escape me?

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:26.272 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
I'm warning you! Let go!

Ah! Not the suit!

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:51.715 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Now you owe me, too, Hosomichi!

00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:54.009 position:50% align:center
So you better make it count!

00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:56.511 position:50% align:center

[HOSOMICHI]
Roger that!

00:19:17.407 --> 00:19:21.536 position:50% align:center
Rin, I, um... I came
to pay you guys back.

00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:26.875 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. For everything.

00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:29.669 position:50% align:center
Heh. I guess you can't trust me.

00:19:31.004 --> 00:19:34.049 position:50% align:center
[RIN] You don't need to give
any excuses or explanations.

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:36.843 position:50% align:center
This Garanndoll says it all.

00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:40.138 position:50% align:center
I already know you're
a liar, a coward, a bully.

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:42.223 position:50% align:center
Just pretty much
the absolute worst.

00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:43.725 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Okay, I get it.

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:45.185 position:50% align:center
I'm not done!

00:19:45.268 --> 00:19:46.728 position:50% align:center
Because despite all of that,

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:49.314 position:50% align:center
your soul resonates
with me, Yuki, and Misa,

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:52.442 position:50% align:center
so you are this
Garanndoll's pilot!

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:56.821 position:50% align:center
I'm your battery girl!
Like it or not, it's you and me!

00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:59.157 position:50% align:center
But enough sappy stuff!

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.119 position:50% align:center
In order to regain control of
this situation, let's team up!

00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:05.330 position:50% align:center
We can turn the tide!

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:06.956 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Rin.

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:13.129 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Apology accepted, but
this isn't over, you feel me?

00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:15.382 position:50% align:center
We'll talk about this
on the way home.

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:17.008 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Huh?

00:20:17.092 --> 00:20:19.886 position:50% align:center
[MISA] Make him get on his
knees and beg for mercy.

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:21.429 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Hang on.

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:24.641 position:50% align:center
How are all three of you
in here at the same time?

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.476 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] The Revolver
Battery is able to hold

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.395 position:50% align:center
three battery girls at once.

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:31.356 position:50% align:center
Now you can utilize the
Garanndoll's full potential!

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:34.150 position:50% align:center
Have fun, but not too much fun!

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:35.902 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
You can respond to any scenario

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:38.238 position:50% align:center
by conveniently switching
between the girls.

00:20:38.321 --> 00:20:40.240 position:50% align:center
It's a playboy's dream machine!

00:20:40.323 --> 00:20:42.242 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
It's for battle, not an affair!

00:20:42.325 --> 00:20:45.120 position:50% align:center
[CAP] So that's why a dirtbag
got to be the pilot.

00:20:45.203 --> 00:20:47.455 position:50% align:center
[MEGANE]
I really hate that guy.

00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:49.791 position:50% align:center
[POCHA]
But with passion, right?

00:20:51.042 --> 00:20:53.211 position:50% align:center
[MUSASHI] Tch. I'd like to
know what a bunch of brats

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:56.381 position:50% align:center
with an archaic robot can
possibly hope to accomplish!

00:20:56.464 --> 00:20:58.049 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] If you're
honestly that curious,

00:20:58.133 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
I'm more than happy to show you!

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:01.136 position:50% align:center
Rin, you're up!

00:21:01.219 --> 00:21:02.637 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Okay!

00:21:06.391 --> 00:21:13.398 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI, RIN yelling]

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:17.152 position:50% align:center
[MUSASHI]
What?

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:22.323 position:50% align:center
[MUSASHI]
I thought the shark was blue.

00:21:22.407 --> 00:21:23.992 position:50% align:center
[BLAZAC, MIMI gasp]

00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:25.952 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
Why did the color change?

00:21:26.036 --> 00:21:29.205 position:50% align:center
That never happened during any
of the Revolver test runs.

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:30.623 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR B]
I don't know what's going on,

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:31.750 position:50% align:center
but Shark One is showing

00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:34.044 position:50% align:center
a completely different
passion pattern!

00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:35.211 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC yells]

00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:37.380 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Not good! Not good! Not good!

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:39.507 position:50% align:center
We have to eject the pilot
and battery girls,

00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:41.176 position:50% align:center
and I mean this instant!

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:42.677 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
What is with you?

00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:44.596 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] I didn't think it'd
happen at a time like this,

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:46.097 position:50% align:center
or perhaps I hoped it wouldn't,

00:21:46.181 --> 00:21:48.975 position:50% align:center
but our past mistake is
about to repeat itself!

00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:51.644 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC yells]

00:21:51.728 --> 00:21:55.357 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] It's Asakusabashi
all over again!

00:22:01.905 --> 00:22:04.491 position:50% align:center
[TANAKA] It took a minute,
but it's finally here.

00:22:04.574 --> 00:22:07.118 position:50% align:center
Behold Shark One's true form.

00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:48.470 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Next time! "I want
to turn the tide with you!
