00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:13.888 position:50% align:center
[HIGHER-UP A] I've heard
reports that rebel activity

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:16.433 position:50% align:center
continues to increase
by the day.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:19.519 position:50% align:center
It's been three months since
you took on this assignment.

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:23.273 position:50% align:center
Maybe if you weren't so lenient,
you'd have more to show for it.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.525 position:50% align:center
[HIGHER-UP B] The last one
in charge was also peaceful,

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:28.361 position:50% align:center
and you remember
what happened to him.

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:29.696 position:50% align:center
[HIGHER-UP C]
Yes.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.824 position:50% align:center
He found himself in a
truly unenviable position.

00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:35.744 position:50% align:center
The bottom line is, we need
to see some progress.

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:38.121 position:50% align:center
You understand, right?

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.748 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Yes.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.252 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
I suppose that's that.

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:48.798 position:50% align:center
We must succeed,
by any means necessary.

00:00:56.514 --> 00:00:59.309 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] There is no need
for two Japans to fight,

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:01.811 position:50% align:center
so let us unite atop
the bridge of friendship

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:05.315 position:50% align:center
Captain Akatsuki wishes
to build with you all!

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:07.984 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
This is his secret strategy?

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.319 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:10.737 position:50% align:center
How's a marathon
supposed to win over

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.781 position:50% align:center
the hearts and
minds of the people?

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:14.949 position:50% align:center
Events like these are
common in this world,

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:17.827 position:50% align:center
so he's just getting
on their level.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:21.998 position:50% align:center
Captain Akatsuki,
I'm rooting for you.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.750 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] Violence wasn't
getting us anywhere

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:25.502 position:50% align:center
in terms of reaching
an understanding

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.671 position:50% align:center
with our Illusory comrades.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:30.382 position:50% align:center
But I'll find a way that does!

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:33.510 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
And he's off!

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:36.304 position:50% align:center
At quite a brisk pace,
might I add!

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:41.393 position:50% align:center
For his ideals, Captain Akatsuki
will run 24 hours without--

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:45.814 position:50% align:center
Huh? What the--?
Where did they come from?

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.719 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Join us! All heroes are welcome!

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.096 position:50% align:center
We'll be waiting for you
at the gates of Akiba Fest!

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:20.932 position:50% align:center
Bring your wallets and passion
and we'll provide the rest!

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:23.476 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:28.273 position:50% align:center
[HIGHER-UPS groan]

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.527 position:50% align:center
[HIGHER-UP B] Not only did
the rebels obstruct you

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.612 position:50% align:center
at every literal
and figurative turn,

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:36.823 position:50% align:center
they used your event to
advertise their own cause

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:37.615 position:50% align:center
to the public!

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.368 position:50% align:center
What a disgrace!

00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:41.953 position:50% align:center
You did your best, sir.

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:44.914 position:50% align:center
[HIGHER-UP A] You've tarnished
the honor of our True Country!

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:48.335 position:50% align:center
[HIGHER-UP C] This is quite
the predicament, I must say.

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:51.755 position:50% align:center
[YAMI]
Gentlemen, come now.

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:55.091 position:50% align:center
Surely we can overlook
one small mishap, hmm?

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.552 position:50% align:center
Akatsuki is still so promising.

00:02:57.635 --> 00:03:02.515 position:50% align:center
And if he's interested, I have
a little suggestion for him.

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:05.560 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:10.607 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC laughing]

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.610 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] The hijack
was highly successful!

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:17.030 position:50% align:center
So you consider juvenile
harassment highly successful?

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:20.033 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare downplay
our sacrifices.

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:23.912 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Ugh.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:27.415 position:50% align:center
Why are we doing this on top
of what we already do?

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:30.418 position:50% align:center
[MISA] Because these sell
like hotcakes online.

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:32.420 position:50% align:center
They're trending.

00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:33.797 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I didn't work my butt off

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.966 position:50% align:center
just so I could help promote
some stupid plushies.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.301 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] You weren't
afraid to show your face

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:40.470 position:50% align:center
when we interfered
with the broadcast.

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:42.180 position:50% align:center
You're damn skippy!

00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:44.391 position:50% align:center
If being a fugitive is
my ticket to stardom,

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.309 position:50% align:center
then bring on a life of crime!

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:48.353 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Jeez, nothing brings you down.

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:50.897 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Speaking of fame,
look at all my fan mail!

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.066 position:50% align:center
They keep saying how cute
the masked girl was!

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:56.069 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] What? All you did
was run next to Akatsuki!

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:59.072 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] The power of a mask
is not to be trifled with.

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:00.824 position:50% align:center
I want an explanation now!

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.158 position:50% align:center
How did this country bumpkin

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.285 position:50% align:center
who obsesses over
friggin' anime characters

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:07.122 position:50% align:center
take center stage over
an idol in gym shorts?

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:08.832 position:50% align:center
Why am I the expert?

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.876 position:50% align:center
[RIN] You have something more
important to piece together.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.045 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Oh... right.

00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:17.674 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Ugh!

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:21.886 position:50% align:center
How's that toy more
important than my career?!

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.142 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI yawns]

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:28.518 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
I'm gonna call it a night.

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:31.438 position:50% align:center
Why? You can't call it quits
before it's completed.

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:36.151 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] I can when it's this
late. I'll finish it tomorrow.

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:38.528 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Oh, you're tired.

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:41.614 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it, where do
you even sleep, Hosomich?

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:42.949 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Anywhere.

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:45.577 position:50% align:center
as long as it's a place
I can lie down, I'm good.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.288 position:50% align:center
Okay, so why not sleep here
in the recharging room?

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:49.622 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
It's already claimed,

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:52.250 position:50% align:center
as evidenced by the girl
snoozing to your right.

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:54.085 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] If you asked them
to arrange a private room,

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.837 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they would.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.547 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Not necessary.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.175 position:50% align:center
I'll get attached if I
have a place of my own.

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:07.932 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Hmm...

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:11.853 position:50% align:center
Welp, I think I'll go
hit the hay myself.

00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:14.356 position:50% align:center
Don't stay up too late.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:18.109 position:50% align:center
I wonder why Hosomichi always
puts on that tough guy act.

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:22.447 position:50% align:center
It's probably because he doesn't
want to be indebted to anyone.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.033 position:50% align:center
What a stupid guy.

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.454 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA] Aren't you
getting a little too used

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:31.081 position:50% align:center
to life around here?

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.832 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Huh?

00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:38.088 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Well, whatever.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.591 position:50% align:center
It's cool till we find a
better source of income.

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:43.426 position:50% align:center
Just keep charming
those little ladies

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.261 position:50% align:center
and slowly but surely
chipping away

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:48.515 position:50% align:center
at your colossal
mountain of debt.

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.809 position:50% align:center
This isn't the kinda
place you belong.

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:52.435 position:50% align:center
I really hope you know that.

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.814 position:50% align:center
Hate for a misunderstanding
to ruin things.

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:57.607 position:50% align:center
Believe me, I know.

00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:59.693 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait.

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
That's right. I know better.

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:25.844 position:50% align:center
[PEOPLE chattering]

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:29.472 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] The more
momentum something has,

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:31.016 position:50% align:center
the harder it is to stop.

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.810 position:50% align:center
Like a mighty boulder
pushed down a steep hill.

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:35.770 position:50% align:center
Arahabaki is that boulder,

00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:37.939 position:50% align:center
and after the publicity
stunts we pulled,

00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:39.441 position:50% align:center
we've gained so much momentum

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:43.361 position:50% align:center
that not even the True Army
can slow us down.

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:45.572 position:50% align:center
Items we assumed
lost to Father Time

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:49.784 position:50% align:center
were recovered after the
liberation of the Akiba dungeon.

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:51.453 position:50% align:center
Vendors peddling various wares

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:53.747 position:50% align:center
opened their stalls
throughout Akihabara,

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.665 position:50% align:center
and an unprecedented
number of people

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:58.001 position:50% align:center
began to flood the streets.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:01.755 position:50% align:center
It was as if the holy land had
regained its former glory.

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:03.381 position:50% align:center
What a time to be alive.

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:04.674 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN A]
Arahabaki.

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:06.509 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN B]
Arahabaki

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:09.429 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Uh, Arahabaki.

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:15.518 position:50% align:center
[CLERK A]
See something you like?

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:18.480 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Uh! That figure!

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:19.981 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:22.400 position:50% align:center
I didn't know it came
in different colors.

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:25.528 position:50% align:center
[CLERK A]
You have exceptional taste, sir.

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:27.530 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE] I can't believe
so many illicit goods

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:31.159 position:50% align:center
are being sold in
the same location.

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:32.369 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI clears throat]

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:33.411 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
There you are.

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:35.872 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
Yes, sir, I'm here.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.499 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] I think we can
blame the last battle

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:40.001 position:50% align:center
for the resurgence
of all these items.

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:42.295 position:50% align:center
At least according
to Yakumo's report.

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:44.381 position:50% align:center
Seems the rebels have been
increasing their forces

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:47.884 position:50% align:center
as well as their transgressions.

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:51.471 position:50% align:center
Curse that giant stuffed
toy and its explosions!

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:53.932 position:50% align:center
Their whole team
did a bang-up job.

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:57.352 position:50% align:center
Okay. So why did
we infiltrate them?

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:59.354 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] We're abiding
by our superiors' wishes

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:01.439 position:50% align:center
and adopting drastic measures.

00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:03.733 position:50% align:center
How drastic?

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:06.569 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Well,

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:09.489 position:50% align:center
I have to unmask the
true face of Arahabaki.

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:11.533 position:50% align:center
The reports aren't
detailed enough.

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:14.160 position:50% align:center
I must get down on their level
and understand the minds

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:17.038 position:50% align:center
influencing these
people the most.

00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:18.248 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:19.916 position:50% align:center
I need to see something
that can't be conveyed

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center

[AKATSUKI]
Hayate? Hayate?

00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:35.015 position:50% align:center
So much for "never being far."

00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:37.142 position:50% align:center
Still acting arbitrarily.

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:40.353 position:50% align:center
Though I suppose
old habits die hard.

[RIN groans]

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:47.360 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Patrolling would've been
way more fun with Hosomichi,

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:49.571 position:50% align:center
but he had to be a butthead.

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:50.947 position:50% align:center
Hm?

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:57.787 position:50% align:center
[RIN] An OC high school ninja
cosplay? That is so sick!

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.169 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE] Aren't these books
in the front a bit thin?

00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:07.839 position:50% align:center
Is that your way of saying
you like heavier content?

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:12.302 position:50% align:center
We have some much spicier
selections in the back. Heh.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:13.219 position:50% align:center
Why not out here?

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:14.471 position:50% align:center
[CLERK B]
Oh, you know.

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:18.308 position:50% align:center
[RIN] No! Stop! That is
not your kinda store!

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.769 position:50% align:center
It's not that bad.

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:27.192 position:50% align:center
[RIN] That was close!
So many more seedy stores.

00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:29.486 position:50% align:center
They've been popping
up like daisies lately.

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:30.612 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
Because they're seeds?

00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:32.489 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Huh?

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:35.116 position:50% align:center
I take it you're fairly
new to Akihabara.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.495 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE] I'm sorry. Have you
and I had a previous encounter?

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.121 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Hm?

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:43.667 position:50% align:center
Pretty sure this is
the first. Right?

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:49.172 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Anywho!

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.216 position:50% align:center
It's normal for a newbie
to accidentally wind up

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:53.802 position:50% align:center
in one of <i>those</i> stores,
so I wouldn't sweat it.

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:55.387 position:50% align:center
But why don't you let me
show you the ropes

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.347 position:50% align:center
so it doesn't happen again?

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:11.903 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Huh?

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:17.575 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEPER A]
Welcome.

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:18.993 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:20.578 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEPER A ]
I gotta say, young man,

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:23.957 position:50% align:center
you look a lot more dapper
than my usual customers.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.208 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
I'm a civil servant.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.544 position:50% align:center
I see. Oh, the irony!

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:30.797 position:50% align:center
Idealists in the very government
trying to bring us down.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.424 position:50% align:center
And you, you're a host, right?

00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:36.428 position:50% align:center
Um, yeah. Or rather,
I used to be.

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:39.681 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
What do you sell here?

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:42.517 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEPER A]
Ramen and beer--the perfect duo.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.477 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] In that case,
I'll take a beer.

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:46.312 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEPER A]
You got it.

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:52.569 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
What's this?

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.863 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEPER A]
On the house, enjoy.

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:57.407 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Hmm. Thank you.

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:05.540 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Hm? There a problem?

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:06.708 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Oh, no.

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:08.960 position:50% align:center
Just wondering
if we've met before.

00:11:09.044 --> 00:11:11.588 position:50% align:center
Were you a former
client of mine?

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:14.382 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
No, this is our first meeting.

00:11:31.775 --> 00:11:32.859 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Meow!

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:36.654 position:50% align:center
[CAP] Aye-aye, Cap'n
Werdcat! Here we go.

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:39.157 position:50% align:center
[CAP screams]

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.078 position:50% align:center
[RESISTANCE] Fish, fish, fish,
fish, fish, fish, fish!

00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:44.662 position:50% align:center
[MEGANE]
Look at all of 'em!

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:46.664 position:50% align:center
[MISA] I'm glad you're psyched
'cause you're going next.

00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:49.376 position:50% align:center
[MEGANE]
I am? Ah, crap.

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:51.920 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEPER A] Just goes to show
how much things have changed

00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:53.880 position:50% align:center
in the administration recently.

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:56.675 position:50% align:center
The very idea of coming out
of the woodwork like this

00:11:56.758 --> 00:11:59.177 position:50% align:center
used to terrify civil servants.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.679 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Hm-hm.

00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:04.391 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] This place
was described to me

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:06.059 position:50% align:center
as a "dump of a city."

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:07.811 position:50% align:center
Where idealists
gather to reminisce

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.437 position:50% align:center
about the former society,

00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:11.898 position:50% align:center
or what they'd call
"the good ol' days."

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.066 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEPER A]
Yep.

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:14.776 position:50% align:center
That kind of phrasing
sure does out you

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:16.861 position:50% align:center
as someone who works
for the government.

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:19.656 position:50% align:center
The ban they put
on "immoral culture"

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:22.200 position:50% align:center
really painted this
place in a new light.

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:24.869 position:50% align:center
The people here embrace
it well enough, though.

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:27.122 position:50% align:center
But yeah, thanks to
the powers that be,

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:28.498 position:50% align:center
Akihabara has been labeled

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:32.293 position:50% align:center
as nothing more than
a city of outcasts.

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:35.171 position:50% align:center
Ah, you've been here a minute.
What do you think of it?

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:37.549 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] I'm so wrapped up
with my day-to-day problems,

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:39.718 position:50% align:center
I don't really have time
to stop and consider

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:42.679 position:50% align:center
the more complicated
and objective issues.

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:44.222 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Which is normal.

00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:45.682 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEPER A]
And relatable.

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:49.060 position:50% align:center
I like to talk big talk,
but when push comes to shove,

00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:52.272 position:50% align:center
I just focus on
my problems, too.

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:53.940 position:50% align:center
Least I'm my own boss.

00:12:54.024 --> 00:12:56.735 position:50% align:center
Gotta thank my lucky stars
for that blessing every day.

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:58.153 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEPER A chuckles]

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:00.030 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
That is lucky.

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
I'm not even sure
if my boss is human.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.909 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEPER A]
Ah. So he's a scumbag?

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:08.079 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry, that's rough.

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:09.956 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
It's the same for me.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.916 position:50% align:center
My superiors think
they know best,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.126 position:50% align:center
but none of them have knowledge

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50% align:center
of what actually goes
on in the field.

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:17.380 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEPER A] Which is why
climbin' the corporate ladder

00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:19.007 position:50% align:center
never appealed to me.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.884 position:50% align:center
Didn't need someone
to tell me what to do

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:23.386 position:50% align:center
because I already knew my
passion was making ramen,

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.263 position:50% align:center
and that's what brought me back.

00:13:25.347 --> 00:13:28.683 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] "Brought you back"?
So you once had a shop here?

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:29.893 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEPER A]
Kinda, sorta.

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:31.686 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you fellas remember
what happened

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.646 position:50% align:center
a little after the
great catastrophe.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:34.939 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Meow!

00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:37.984 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEPER A]
The day this lake formed

00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:41.404 position:50% align:center
and sunk my old ramen shop...

00:13:41.488 --> 00:13:44.407 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
The Asakusabashi incident.

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:47.535 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEPER A] I'd joke the lake
was filled with my tears

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:52.248 position:50% align:center
if I'd actually shed any--
I was more shocked than sad.

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:55.043 position:50% align:center
Guess another reason it doesn't
seem like such a tragedy

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:58.546 position:50% align:center
is the evacuation kept
anybody from dying.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.715 position:50% align:center
Didn't stop the
government and country

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:03.093 position:50% align:center
from being thrown
into chaos, though.

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:04.719 position:50% align:center
Heard some families
were split up

00:14:04.803 --> 00:14:06.638 position:50% align:center
and never found
each other again.

00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:08.390 position:50% align:center
I lost track with my family.

00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:10.225 position:50% align:center
But if I keep fighting
the True Army,

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:11.810 position:50% align:center
then maybe we'll
reunite someday.

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:14.020 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEPER A] The True Army
says they're here to help,

00:14:14.104 --> 00:14:16.648 position:50% align:center
then they go and level a town.

00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:18.775 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
You're mistaken!

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:21.069 position:50% align:center
I've seen official
records of that day

00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:22.654 position:50% align:center
and they state this
lake was created

00:14:22.737 --> 00:14:25.198 position:50% align:center
when Arahabaki's
Garann went berserk.

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:28.952 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Did those records
explain how it went berserk?

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.705 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] It was an old,
improperly calibrated model,

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:34.249 position:50% align:center
and they lost control
of its power unit.

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:37.919 position:50% align:center
Intentional or not,
they're the ones responsible.

00:14:38.003 --> 00:14:41.464 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Don't ever
transmutate their passion.

00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:44.342 position:50% align:center
Don't make the
same mistake I did.

00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:50.265 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] The Akiba Renaissance
is about to take its next step.

00:14:50.348 --> 00:14:52.100 position:50% align:center
Crossed caution
tape marks the spot

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:55.687 position:50% align:center
on a treasure trove
of confiscated gems.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:59.065 position:50% align:center
We should take back what's
ours. It's only right.

00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:02.777 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:05.864 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Go ahead, Ukai.

00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:07.407 position:50% align:center
What?

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:11.494 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:16.499 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA grumbles]

00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:19.669 position:50% align:center
[growls] Too busy breakin'
hearts to answer?

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:20.837 position:50% align:center
That bottle empty yet?

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.047 position:50% align:center
Nope.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.548 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:27.177 position:50% align:center
Huh? Pick up within three
seconds the next time I ca-- Uh!

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.596 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
The bookie?

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:32.974 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA] Ah! I'm so sorry!
I thought you were someone else!

00:15:33.058 --> 00:15:35.352 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA laughing]

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:38.563 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA] What? No, I've
been collecting all of it.

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:42.817 position:50% align:center
Oh, nothing.
Again, I'm so sorry!

00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:45.945 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:47.947 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI sighs]

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:49.449 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
That your boss calling?

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:51.326 position:50% align:center
If our little chats
weren't always so crappy,

00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:52.744 position:50% align:center
I might answer.

00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:54.204 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Fair enough.

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:58.124 position:50% align:center
You know, you strike me as
a proper member of society,

00:15:58.208 --> 00:16:00.085 position:50% align:center
which makes your presence
in a place like this

00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:02.545 position:50% align:center
all the more curious.

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:05.090 position:50% align:center
Do you find the city appealing?

00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:07.008 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:16:07.092 --> 00:16:08.593 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
The rebels' base of operations

00:16:08.677 --> 00:16:11.137 position:50% align:center
is rumored to be hidden here.

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:13.306 position:50% align:center
Did you come to the
festival despite knowing

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.600 position:50% align:center
what your attendance
could imply?

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:17.352 position:50% align:center
I guess I did.

00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:18.853 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
You guess?

00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:21.648 position:50% align:center
I don't support
Arahabaki's actions 100%,

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
so don't get me wrong.

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:25.777 position:50% align:center
I've never obsessed
over a specific hobby,

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.696 position:50% align:center
so I don't really get
why they keep going off

00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:30.198 position:50% align:center
about "culture" or whatever.

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:33.201 position:50% align:center
But what I do get is how happy
their passions make them.

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:35.286 position:50% align:center
That's what looks fun.

00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:38.540 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
They spend that energy

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:40.917 position:50% align:center
in misguided ways, though.

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:43.211 position:50% align:center
Being passionate is just fine,

00:16:43.294 --> 00:16:46.715 position:50% align:center
but pouring that passion into
illegal idealist activities

00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:48.717 position:50% align:center
transforms it into poison.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.637 position:50% align:center
It breaks us,
wouldn't you agree?

00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:58.643 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
Huh? What's reflexology?

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:01.396 position:50% align:center
Nothing that you need to know!
Trust me on this one.

00:17:01.479 --> 00:17:03.314 position:50% align:center
I'll take you
somewhere much better!

00:17:03.398 --> 00:17:06.067 position:50% align:center
Guess I trust you. But what's
so bad about high school girls?

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:08.653 position:50% align:center
[RIN laughs]

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:14.784 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
It's good!

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:18.329 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Told you! It's crazy
you've never had kebabs before.

00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:19.247 position:50% align:center
What's your name?

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:20.498 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
I'm Hayate.

00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:23.835 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Nice to officially
meet you! I'm Rin Akagi.

00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:26.588 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
Just like Mount Akagi.

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:30.091 position:50% align:center
Where are you from,
if you don't mind me asking?

00:17:30.175 --> 00:17:31.509 position:50% align:center
Far away.

00:17:31.593 --> 00:17:32.510 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Hm?

00:17:32.594 --> 00:17:34.846 position:50% align:center
Like out in the boonies?

00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:39.100 position:50% align:center
[RIN] The day is young
and so are we!

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:41.978 position:50% align:center
Akihabara is tons of fun!

00:17:42.062 --> 00:17:44.272 position:50% align:center
[RIN squeals]

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:46.775 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Ooh, pics!

00:17:46.858 --> 00:17:49.361 position:50% align:center
[RIN chuckles]

00:17:49.444 --> 00:17:51.154 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
This your first burger, too?

00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:53.198 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
Yes, but I've heard of them.

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:54.157 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Tasty?

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.408 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
Indeed.

00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:56.868 position:50% align:center
Seems there are things
you cannot fully grasp

00:17:56.951 --> 00:17:58.828 position:50% align:center
through data alone.

00:18:00.038 --> 00:18:02.665 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Uh! A <i>Zaburn</i> gacha!

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:03.833 position:50% align:center
[HAYATE]
A Za-what?

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:05.752 position:50% align:center
It's a machine that
pops out random toys

00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:09.005 position:50% align:center
from my favorite anime series.

00:18:09.089 --> 00:18:12.384 position:50% align:center
Aw! Look how cute he is!

00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:21.810 position:50% align:center
Again? I guess that's okay.
You get one, too!

00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:24.854 position:50% align:center
Now you and I match!

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:27.148 position:50% align:center
Oh, um, cool.

00:18:27.232 --> 00:18:28.942 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:32.070 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] I heard this tidbit
from a friend a while back.

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:36.199 position:50% align:center
The backbone of Arahabaki
is a bunch of teenage girls.

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:37.659 position:50% align:center
Because of their fiery passion,

00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:40.870 position:50% align:center
these girls are able to
fuel an entire rebellion.

00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:43.081 position:50% align:center
So a guy like me who
has nothing like that

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:45.417 position:50% align:center
can't help but respect them.

00:18:49.004 --> 00:18:50.380 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
You think it's respectable

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:53.967 position:50% align:center
to throw your life away over
a self-indulgent pastime.

00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:59.931 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] The True Army won't
always stay on the defensive.

00:19:00.015 --> 00:19:03.309 position:50% align:center
Once the rebels get
serious, so will they.

00:19:03.393 --> 00:19:07.188 position:50% align:center
Forgive me if what I'm about
to say is out of line.

00:19:07.272 --> 00:19:09.024 position:50% align:center
You've written these
peoples' wants off

00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:10.483 position:50% align:center
because you see them as selfish,

00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:12.652 position:50% align:center
but I think it runs
deeper than that.

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:14.946 position:50% align:center
They're more than just
hobbies, they're lifestyles.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:16.448 position:50% align:center
And folks would
rather be cast out

00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:19.200 position:50% align:center
by the rest of the world
than surrender that life.

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:21.786 position:50% align:center
You deem the things
they covet as poisonous

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:25.123 position:50% align:center
when they would sooner die
from being deprived of 'em.

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:27.876 position:50% align:center
I guess I empathize, though.

00:19:27.959 --> 00:19:30.420 position:50% align:center
You'd have to be a hopeless
ramen-tic like me

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:33.340 position:50% align:center
to set up shop here again.

00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:34.883 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Hm.

00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:39.971 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
But it's your lifestyle.

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:41.931 position:50% align:center
And for good reason.

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:44.684 position:50% align:center
The fine cuisine I had the
pleasure to partake in today

00:19:44.768 --> 00:19:49.272 position:50% align:center
was certainly worth devoting
a lifetime to mastering!

00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:53.818 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEPER A] Nah. Nothin'
that special about ramen.

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:56.446 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:56.529 --> 00:20:00.992 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA chuckles]

00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:04.204 position:50% align:center
How are your noodles
hangin', Pops? Huh?

00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:06.706 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Lay off, man. Are you drunk?

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:10.627 position:50% align:center
Maybe. And what're you
so laid back for?

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:14.005 position:50% align:center
Hosomichi, guess who
I had a chat with today.

00:20:14.089 --> 00:20:16.132 position:50% align:center
The damn bookie of all people!

00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:17.634 position:50% align:center
And you'd know that

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:20.178 position:50% align:center
if you actually picked up your
phone whenever I call you!

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:23.807 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEPER A] Excuse me, sir.
You need to calm down!

00:20:26.601 --> 00:20:27.936 position:50% align:center
What the actual hell?

00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:31.272 position:50% align:center
Geezers should know their place!

00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:33.566 position:50% align:center
Huh? Whoopsie.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.820 position:50% align:center
Hi. Have we met before, ma'am?

00:20:36.903 --> 00:20:39.447 position:50% align:center
You do not wanna mess
around with this guy.

00:20:39.531 --> 00:20:42.534 position:50% align:center
Because Arahabaki
'n' me are tight!

00:20:42.617 --> 00:20:44.619 position:50% align:center
Wait, do you even
know who they are?

00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:46.204 position:50% align:center
The Resistance, right?

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:50.458 position:50% align:center
Yeah! The rebel army with
the freaky giant robot!

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:54.546 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] You just slipped up
by putting your hands on me.

00:20:54.629 --> 00:20:56.423 position:50% align:center
Pretty ballsy for someone
who doesn't have any,

00:20:56.506 --> 00:20:58.466 position:50% align:center
wouldn't ya say?

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:02.137 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Ow.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.055 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Pathetic.

00:21:05.724 --> 00:21:08.977 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA] Prissy punk!
You realize what you've done?

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.605 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] Assault a
representative of Arahabaki.

00:21:14.941 --> 00:21:15.900 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI gasps]

00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:17.193 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:20.697 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEPER A]
You're with the True Army!

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.284 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI] I've unmasked
Arahabaki and seen its ugliness.

00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Hosomichi!

00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:27.871 position:50% align:center
Get your giant robot
'n' crush that guy!

00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:29.873 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Ix-nay on the obot-ray!

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:31.249 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
But you're the pilot!

00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:33.376 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.756 position:50% align:center
Ahh. It seems fate's
in a humorous mood.

00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:40.342 position:50% align:center
We shared a meal
and conversation

00:21:40.425 --> 00:21:43.428 position:50% align:center
without knowing
we're bitter foes.

00:21:47.182 --> 00:21:48.516 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
What's this about?

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.268 position:50% align:center
[UKAI] I wish I could
tell you, Commander.

00:21:50.352 --> 00:21:51.728 position:50% align:center
All I know is a
fleet of airships

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:54.814 position:50% align:center
is gathering around
the exhibition hall.

00:21:54.898 --> 00:21:57.442 position:50% align:center
Somethin' big is
about to go down.

00:21:57.525 --> 00:21:58.360 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:21:58.443 --> 00:21:59.486 position:50% align:center
[UKAI screams]

00:21:59.569 --> 00:22:02.113 position:50% align:center
What just happened?
Talk to me, Ukai!

00:22:03.782 --> 00:22:07.327 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] What in the name
of anime is going on?

00:23:46.426 --> 00:23:48.887 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Next time! "Look at
that! Turning the tables!

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:50.013 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Of betrayal!"
