[ANNOUNCER A]
This announcement is for

00:00:12.387 --> 00:00:16.766 position:50% align:center
all of our beloved
Illusory Country citizens.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.729 position:50% align:center
It's nearly 11 PM,
the hour of the rat.

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:22.647 position:50% align:center
All citizens without
special permission

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:24.399 position:50% align:center
must return home at this time.

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:27.569 position:50% align:center
We greatly appreciate
your cooperation.

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:28.737 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN A]
Hear that?

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.946 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN B]
Yeah. That sucks for Hakata.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.531 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN C]
Damn the True Army!

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:33.908 position:50% align:center
They think they have
the run of the place!

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:36.911 position:50% align:center
Shit, what are the
higher-ups thinking?

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:39.539 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN A] Well, I'm thinking
the era of idols is done-zies.

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:40.790 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN C]
Don't be stupid!

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.667 position:50% align:center
As long as they have fans
who support them,

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:44.294 position:50% align:center
idols will never die out!

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:47.255 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Exactly! It's not over!

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:52.594 position:50% align:center
You still have an idol.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:55.930 position:50% align:center
And she's right here!

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:58.600 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:00.435 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] The Little Animals
of Fortune Idol Group

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:03.063 position:50% align:center
will hop above the status quo!

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:06.191 position:50% align:center
Rabbit Foot...
reporting for duty!

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:08.443 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:11.279 position:50% align:center
Alrighty, you honey-bunnies!
You know the drill!

00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:12.447 position:50% align:center
One, two, three!

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.618 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Rabbit! Foot! Love! Whoo!

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.120 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
That was great, everyone!

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:20.288 position:50% align:center
So here's the thing,

00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:22.165 position:50% align:center
the True Army arrested
the other members,

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.584 position:50% align:center
leaving me all by my lonesome.

00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:28.338 position:50% align:center
But it's okay! That just
makes me a solo artist now!

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:31.508 position:50% align:center
Name's Yuki Aoba!
Yuki-rin works, too!

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:33.635 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheers]

00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:37.722 position:50% align:center
[giggles] Without
further ado... Ready?

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:40.308 position:50% align:center
Let's make it hoppin'!

00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:43.645 position:50% align:center
[YUKI screams]

00:01:43.728 --> 00:01:45.605 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN A]
Protect Yuki-rin!

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:47.774 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN B]
As long as we have her,

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:49.901 position:50% align:center
we still have our dreams.

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:52.987 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's going on?

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:55.740 position:50% align:center
[gasps, screams]

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.709 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Thanks to Shark One's victory,

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:31.711 position:50% align:center
Akihabara was saved.

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:35.507 position:50% align:center
However, due to the tremendous
levels of passion she exuded,

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.886 position:50% align:center
Rin Akagi fell victim
to severe burnout.

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:42.806 position:50% align:center
Rest is essential
for battery girls.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.059 position:50% align:center
She must recharge her heart,
as well as her mind.

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:52.607 position:50% align:center
Za-za-za-za-za. Za-za-za-Zabuh!
Za-za-za-za-za. Za-za-za-Zabuh!

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:54.401 position:50% align:center
This is effective?

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.444 position:50% align:center
Her heart powers the Garanndoll.

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:59.155 position:50% align:center
That machine literally
runs on her passion.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.949 position:50% align:center
The most efficient
way to recharge her

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:03.284 position:50% align:center
is to expose her to
whatever it is she enjoys.

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:05.787 position:50% align:center
Meaning, commercials
for TV shows?

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.539 position:50% align:center
[MIMI] Make do with what
you have, you know?

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:10.709 position:50% align:center
So you're saying she's
always been a ditz?

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:15.714 position:50% align:center
Well, whenever she overexerts
herself, her brain suffers.

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:17.132 position:50% align:center
It turns to straight mush!

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:21.386 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] That's right!
It's like a bowl of oatmeal!

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.013 position:50% align:center
This state is just scary.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.431 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
You think?

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:27.183 position:50% align:center
So, hey, if we're sans
battery girl when they attack,

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
aren't we in trouble?

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:31.021 position:50% align:center
Thankfully, we're one
step ahead of you.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.397 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.734 position:50% align:center
She should be here by now.
The second battery girl.

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:37.902 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:38.611 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:39.529 position:50% align:center
[RESISTANCE cheering]

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:41.156 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI, MUNAKATA]
Huh?!

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.868 position:50% align:center
[RESISTANCE]
Yuki-rin!

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:47.871 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Hi! We're the Little
Animals Idol Group!

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:51.041 position:50% align:center
But you all know us
as Rabbit Foot!

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:53.793 position:50% align:center
My name is Yuki Aoba!

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:56.254 position:50% align:center
The last remaining
member is here to stay!

00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:58.214 position:50% align:center
So make some noise for her!

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:01.051 position:50% align:center
[RESISTANCE cheering]

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:02.844 position:50% align:center
Who is she?

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:04.012 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Yuki-rin.

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:06.765 position:50% align:center
An idol and a battery girl.
Double threat!

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:07.724 position:50% align:center
--[MUNAKATA] Uh...
--[HOSOMICHI] Huh?

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:10.310 position:50% align:center
Thanks oh-so-much
for having me!

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:15.148 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Her potential
passion is extraordinary!

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:16.399 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
You don't say...

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:18.985 position:50% align:center
[UKAI] Got a lot of heart
for a 17-year-old.

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:20.111 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI yelps]

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:21.654 position:50% align:center
[UKAI]
She's keepin' the group alive

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:24.657 position:50% align:center
despite the other members
being sent off to Odaiba.

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:27.494 position:50% align:center
True Army got every last
one of 'em except her.

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:28.703 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
And you are?

00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:30.789 position:50% align:center
Heh. Call me Ukai.

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:33.792 position:50% align:center
I do everything from combat
training to gathering intel.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:36.961 position:50% align:center
Not a jack-of-all-trades,
the king! Dig?

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:38.296 position:50% align:center
A king?

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.008 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI] Yeah.
All hail king of the weirdos.

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:45.303 position:50% align:center
[RESISTANCE cheers]

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:50.100 position:50% align:center
Welcome, Yuki. Have you been
briefed on the current sitch?

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:51.643 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:54.062 position:50% align:center
When I was abducted by that
Ukai guy, I got the gist of it!

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:54.938 position:50% align:center
Say what?

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.981 position:50% align:center
She's feisty! Ha!

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:58.650 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Why is he laughing?

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:01.319 position:50% align:center
I've always been intrigued
by the resistance.

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:04.614 position:50% align:center
So I would be tickled pink to
pilot your giant robot, sir!

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:06.950 position:50% align:center
Music to my ears, young lady.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.785 position:50% align:center
You do know you'll be
risking your life.

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:10.620 position:50% align:center
It's not some kind of game.

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:12.080 position:50% align:center
I'm only acting so chipper

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.374 position:50% align:center
'cause I'm excited to
protect our culture.

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:15.875 position:50% align:center
Just like everyone here!

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50% align:center
[RESISTANCE]
Yeah!

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:19.796 position:50% align:center
It's a perfect fit!

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:23.341 position:50% align:center
Idols love making smiles.
It's our job to lift people up!

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:24.759 position:50% align:center
So that's what I'll do!

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:27.303 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
What wonderful words, Yuki-rin!

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:28.847 position:50% align:center
They said that?

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.433 position:50% align:center
Yes, and our leader is delighted
to hear you'll be our pilot.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:35.228 position:50% align:center
Huh? Your leader? So this
enormous plushie is...

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:38.356 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC]
Correct! The head honcho!

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.607 position:50% align:center
[YUKI squeals]

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:41.109 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA chuckles]

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:44.154 position:50% align:center
I look forward to
working with you!

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:46.656 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you. I'm Munakata.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.992 position:50% align:center
You know, if you'll be
working as an idol here,

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.285 position:50% align:center
you're gonna need a manager.

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:51.828 position:50% align:center
Professionally speaking, yeah.

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.246 position:50% align:center
Well, then,

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:55.832 position:50% align:center
considering all my connections,
I'd be up for the task.

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:58.877 position:50% align:center
I'm in good with everyone here,
and that includes Hosomichi.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.461 position:50% align:center
Small flex.

00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:00.587 position:50% align:center
Hosomichi?

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.797 position:50% align:center
There he is now! Yeah!

00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:05.550 position:50% align:center
We're so close he'd give me
a kidney if I asked him to.

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:06.968 position:50% align:center
Or even an eyeball.

00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:09.346 position:50% align:center
Hey. You're not as
funny as you think.

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:10.847 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Can you stop being a sour puss

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.098 position:50% align:center
for, like, ten minutes?

00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:13.975 position:50% align:center
I mean, we're like in
the presence of an idol.

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:17.312 position:50% align:center
Or perhaps, you're peeved at
the idea of working with her.

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:19.522 position:50% align:center
You finally managed to
hit things off with Rin,

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:21.858 position:50% align:center
now it feels like
you're cheating, right?

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.569 position:50% align:center
That couldn't be
further from the truth.

00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:29.282 position:50% align:center
A job's a job.
I simply do what I'm told.

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:32.952 position:50% align:center
There. You see just how friendly
and casual he is with me?

00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:34.996 position:50% align:center
I'd be an ideal manager for you!

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.706 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Umm... Hmm...

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.083 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:42.629 position:50% align:center
[YUKI humming]

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:44.047 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.465 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
If I can choose, I'd much
rather be managed by you!

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:52.305 position:50% align:center
Fair, idols get
what they want.

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:54.182 position:50% align:center
But I'll be the
head manager, okay?

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:55.600 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:57.268 position:50% align:center
We'll have a trial run once
they finish maintenance.

00:07:57.352 --> 00:08:00.647 position:50% align:center
Rest up until then!
Or whatever it is idols do.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:05.110 position:50% align:center
Heh. Good luck, manager.

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:09.072 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Yeah, I hear ya.

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:13.451 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Must be rough putting on

00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:14.619 position:50% align:center
such an energetic show

00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:16.705 position:50% align:center
immediately after
being kidnapped.

00:08:16.788 --> 00:08:18.289 position:50% align:center
You need a hug?

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:19.958 position:50% align:center

Oh, don't bother with that act.

What?

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:23.044 position:50% align:center
So what's the game plan?

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:27.757 position:50% align:center
Wait, you-- Uh, sorry. What?

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:32.762 position:50% align:center
C'mon! Idols have schedules,
you know! We work!

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:34.305 position:50% align:center
What kind of schedule?

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:36.182 position:50% align:center
Meet-and-greets with the fans
along with signing sessions

00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:37.225 position:50% align:center
are, of course, a must.

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:38.852 position:50% align:center
A radio show would be nice.

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:41.021 position:50% align:center
Ooh! I'll have
concerts on the daily.

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:42.939 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm gonna need
time to rehearse!

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:45.817 position:50% align:center
And it's my job to
arrange all that?

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.903 position:50% align:center
Duh, like, you want me
to fuel that mech, yeah?

00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:50.488 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.

00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:54.075 position:50% align:center
You don't happen to have a split
personality by chance, do you?

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:55.660 position:50% align:center
You're one to talk.

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:58.997 position:50% align:center
I saw that mask you put on as
soon as the glasses came off.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.165 position:50% align:center
Who knew one accessory

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:03.001 position:50% align:center
was the difference
between cool and fool?

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:07.213 position:50% align:center
You and I are alike in that way,
so I won't judge too hard.

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:08.840 position:50% align:center
Should even help us get along.

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:11.843 position:50% align:center
And lead me down the path
to falling for you.

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:14.346 position:50% align:center
The lies just keep on comin'.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.265 position:50% align:center
[YUKI chuckles]

00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:18.767 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
That one was true,

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.020 position:50% align:center

my loyal manager.

All right, then!
It's time to work!

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:28.401 position:50% align:center
You have five minutes to
fetch something soothing

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:29.944 position:50% align:center
for my throat!

00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:32.530 position:50% align:center
Okay, fine! I'm going!

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:33.782 position:50% align:center
Wear your glasses!

00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:36.618 position:50% align:center
I want a manager repping
me, not a sleazeball!

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:38.912 position:50% align:center
They're on. Jeez!

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.707 position:50% align:center

I have a manager.

[YUKI]
I'm Yuki! It's nice to meet you!

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:54.636 position:50% align:center
I have a little PSA for
you all today! Ta-da!

[GIRLS]
Huh?

00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:57.263 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Once upon a time,

00:09:57.347 --> 00:10:00.016 position:50% align:center
Rabbit Foot was the best group
of performers on the planet!

But A-chan, Riocchi,
Mona-pon, Nano-shi,

00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:06.147 position:50% align:center
and, uh, What's-her-face,

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:10.068 position:50% align:center
the True Army found all five
of them and locked them away.

00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:15.031 position:50% align:center
Now I'm by myself in
this cruel, cold world.

[YUKI]
But I refuse to give up!

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:23.707 position:50% align:center
I'll act as Arahabaki's
special teammate,

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.126 position:50% align:center
fighting alongside everybody
in the Garanndoll!

[RESISTANCE cheering]

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.879 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's powered by love,

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:34.175 position:50% align:center
and there is nothing I love
more than being an idol!

How'd a bunch of randos like you
manage to infiltrate our base?

[CAP] Sorry to bother you, but
we've been invaded by an idol!

[MEGANE] You're the idol of
the resistance, though,

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:23.850 position:50% align:center

completely censored?

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:14.859 position:50% align:center
That was a pretty
harsh thing to say.

Not exactly "idol talk,"
if you ask me.

00:12:17.654 --> 00:12:18.947 position:50% align:center

I always act like a perfect idol

Depends on the battery girl.

her passion takes.

You're not wrong.

Ever hear of Yukiko
Aono? It's her song.

00:13:38.777 --> 00:13:40.612 position:50% align:center
I'd be super shocked
if you actually knew it

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:42.739 position:50% align:center
since she only sings it live.

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:45.533 position:50% align:center
It's like a secret
for hardcore fans.

00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:50.038 position:50% align:center
But it's important
to me. Very important.

I'll never forget...

I saw her perform it at
concert I went to with my mom

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:04.010 position:50% align:center
when I was a kid.

00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:05.970 position:50% align:center
I remember the lights.

00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:09.140 position:50% align:center
How the audience glowed
like a sea of stars.

00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:12.143 position:50% align:center
And at the center was
a girl everyone loved.

Thank you, True Army.

were never onboard.

That's why I'm here!

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.041 position:50% align:center
If there are people
who want idols,

00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:36.835 position:50% align:center
then I'll be one for them!

00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:40.714 position:50% align:center
The perfect idol, Yuki Aoba.
One that everybody loves.

Well, I wish I could say
that it handled better.

but you're our only hope.

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:51.534 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] No worries!
Leave it to me, Commander!

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:53.828 position:50% align:center
I guess this is what you
call a guerrilla gig!

00:15:53.912 --> 00:15:55.413 position:50% align:center
It'll be the perfect debut!

00:15:55.497 --> 00:15:57.374 position:50% align:center
Especially for a
little battery girl!

00:15:57.457 --> 00:16:01.002 position:50% align:center
[RESISTANCE]
Yuki-rin!

00:16:01.086 --> 00:16:03.880 position:50% align:center
You can do it, Yuki-rin!

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:06.174 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] This makes me
so hoppy, you guys!

00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:08.093 position:50% align:center
Like, it's not even bunny!

00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:08.968 position:50% align:center
[RESISTENCE cheers]

00:16:09.052 --> 00:16:10.595 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:13.098 position:50% align:center
From now on, I won't just be
a girl from Rabbit Foot.

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:16.476 position:50% align:center
I'll be the bun-ifide idol of
freedom for the resistance!

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:18.436 position:50% align:center
Here I go!

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.315 position:50% align:center
[RESISTENCE cheers]

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
Listen up, Hosomichi.

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:27.070 position:50% align:center
Unlike Rin, Yuki's never
operated a Garanndoll before.

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:28.863 position:50% align:center
Make sure you
keep her energized.

00:16:28.947 --> 00:16:32.158 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know. I'll keep
it under control.

00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:37.122 position:50% align:center
[RESISTANCE]
Yuki-rin! Yuki-rin! Yuki-rin...!

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:40.208 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Huh? Huh?

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:41.543 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:43.586 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hosomichi.

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:48.466 position:50% align:center
Quick question, and be
honest, do I look cute?

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:49.884 position:50% align:center
What? Who cares?

00:16:49.968 --> 00:16:54.681 position:50% align:center
Just answer, you idiot! Well?

00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:58.101 position:50% align:center
Random, I know, but do you
think I can become an idol?

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:01.938 position:50% align:center
The type that people
can't help but love?

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:04.899 position:50% align:center
I definitely see
that happening!

00:17:04.983 --> 00:17:06.693 position:50% align:center
If you mix all your
talents together,

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:09.320 position:50% align:center
you're, like, the perfect
idol everybody wants!

00:17:09.404 --> 00:17:11.990 position:50% align:center
That everybody wants?

00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:20.290 position:50% align:center
Ah, okay. Yeah.
Ready to bounce when you are!

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:31.718 position:50% align:center
[sighs] How am I supposed
to fight like this?

00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:34.721 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] How do you think?
Shout, my dear boy!

00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:36.514 position:50% align:center
The sound of your voice
will supply her

00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:38.933 position:50% align:center
with all the strength she needs!

00:17:39.017 --> 00:17:43.813 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Seriously? Fine! Whatever!

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:47.108 position:50% align:center
Rabbit! Foot! Love! Whoo!

00:17:47.192 --> 00:17:50.403 position:50% align:center
[FANS]
Rabbit! Foot! Love! Whoo!

00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:56.493 position:50% align:center
Rabbit! Foot! Love! Whoo!
Rabbit! Foot! Love! Whoo...!

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.292 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] An idol's source
of power is her fans!

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:14.344 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Let's get this party started!

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR A]
The Garanndoll is transforming!

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:21.976 position:50% align:center
[FANS] Rabbit! Foot! Love! Whoo!
Rabbit! Foot! Love! Whoo...!

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.895 position:50% align:center
Look at those idealist pigs.

00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:26.690 position:50% align:center
What mud are they
wallowing in now?

00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:31.986 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Yuki-rin!

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:42.247 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Go and take the stage!

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:47.794 position:50% align:center
[FANS]
Rabbit! Foot! Love! Whoo!

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:50.714 position:50% align:center
What?

00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:54.175 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI grunts]

00:18:57.262 --> 00:18:58.888 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:02.934 position:50% align:center
I made it! Sorry to keep
you all waiting!

00:19:05.395 --> 00:19:07.105 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Tee-hee!

00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:10.859 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys!

00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:13.361 position:50% align:center
I'm part of the Little Animals
of Fortune Idol Group,

00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:15.238 position:50% align:center
better known as Rabbit Foot!

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:19.034 position:50% align:center
But as of today, I'm the idol
of freedom for the resistance.

00:19:19.117 --> 00:19:20.535 position:50% align:center
Yuki-rin!

00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:23.038 position:50% align:center
I've got a whole bunch of
butterflies in my tummy!

00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:26.166 position:50% align:center
I have no idea what
to do! I'm so nervous!

00:19:26.249 --> 00:19:28.543 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:30.128 position:50% align:center
[MUNAKATA]
Can that thing really fight?

00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:32.088 position:50% align:center
[MIMI]
I wish I knew.

00:19:32.172 --> 00:19:34.507 position:50% align:center
Huh? What killed the mood?

00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:39.846 position:50% align:center
It's me, everyone!
Your favorite honey-bunny!

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:42.807 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh. Better think fast.

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:48.313 position:50% align:center
Uh? Guys? What's going on?

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:51.274 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:53.818 position:50% align:center
[MUSASHI]
Say bye-bye, bunny!

00:19:58.156 --> 00:19:59.783 position:50% align:center
I wanted to play
with the shark model,

00:19:59.866 --> 00:20:03.536 position:50% align:center
but you give me this
oversized stuffed animal?

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.247 position:50% align:center
Ah! That really hurt!
Why is this?

00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:07.665 position:50% align:center
Everything is falling apart

00:20:07.749 --> 00:20:09.209 position:50% align:center
because you're not
doing your job!

00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:11.169 position:50% align:center
If one of us messed up
our job, it's you!

00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:12.420 position:50% align:center
What's with the bunny suit?

00:20:12.504 --> 00:20:16.007 position:50% align:center
How should I know?
I'm new to this!

00:20:16.091 --> 00:20:17.467 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.010 position:50% align:center
[YUKI gasps]

00:20:22.013 --> 00:20:24.099 position:50% align:center
They're all gone.

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:29.145 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I'm an idol,

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:31.690 position:50% align:center
and everyone's
supposed to love idols.

00:20:31.773 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center
That's what it means
to be one. Right?

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:35.985 position:50% align:center
Yuki.

00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:38.154 position:50% align:center
Just stop and think of what
a real idol would do

00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:40.949 position:50% align:center
if they were you.

00:20:41.032 --> 00:20:44.953 position:50% align:center
It's no use,
I'm coming up blank.

00:20:46.037 --> 00:20:48.915 position:50% align:center
[YUKI screams]

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.252 position:50% align:center
[MUSASHI]
What a pathetic opponent.

00:20:52.335 --> 00:20:54.421 position:50% align:center
I did want something to crush,

00:20:54.504 --> 00:20:55.922 position:50% align:center
but I thought it'd
be more worthwhile

00:20:56.006 --> 00:20:57.590 position:50% align:center
than a metallic slug with ears!

00:20:57.674 --> 00:20:59.509 position:50% align:center
Yuki!

00:21:02.762 --> 00:21:05.140 position:50% align:center
I'll lay waste to you right
along with this trash heap

00:21:05.223 --> 00:21:08.601 position:50% align:center
you have the gall
to call a city!

00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:10.395 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:13.398 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] And that's the sound
of the left arm overheating.

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:16.860 position:50% align:center
It appears you've used more
power than it has to give.

00:21:16.943 --> 00:21:19.779 position:50% align:center
It's difficult to handle,
yet delicate as a flower.

00:21:19.863 --> 00:21:21.281 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Enough of your sass.

00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:24.826 position:50% align:center
Hear me? Cease your current
assault and return to base.

00:21:25.827 --> 00:21:30.623 position:50% align:center
Roger that. Consider this
test run officially complete.

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:32.042 position:50% align:center
[AKATSUKI]
Good.

00:21:34.711 --> 00:21:39.466 position:50% align:center
Akihabara. This won't be
the last you see of me.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.526 position:50% align:center
[HOSOMICHI]
Yuki, I...

00:22:04.032 --> 00:22:09.329 position:50% align:center
The Garann's broken.
Just like my dream.

00:23:45.884 --> 00:23:48.178 position:50% align:center
[BALZAC] Next time:
"I mean, I'm an idol!
