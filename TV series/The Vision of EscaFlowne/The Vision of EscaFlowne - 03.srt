1
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,500
[HITOMI] Was it all just
a dream? Or was it a vision?

2
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,458
Fanelia was burning.

3
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:58,916
The flames surrounded us,
their heat choking.

4
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,625
Then suddenly, Van and I
were engulfed in light

5
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,958
and sent into the heavens.

6
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,625
Strange things happen
here on Gaea.

7
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,625
A mysterious world where
the moon and the Earth

8
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,541
hang in the sky.

9
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,583
[VAN] As near as I can tell,
we haven't left Gaea.

10
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,333
But Hitomi must have
landed somewhere else.

11
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:42,083
Where is she? And what
am I supposed to do now?

12
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,625
[HITOMI]
This is bad.

13
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,125
I'm stuck out here all alone and
I've got no idea where to go.

14
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,041
[HITOMI] Help me. I need
you to show me the way.

15
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,791
Tell me which direction
I should go.

16
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:11,416
[HITOMI gasps]

17
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,416
[giggles]

18
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,375
[HITOMI yelps]

19
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,666
[giggles]

20
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,000
[whimpers]

21
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,416
[screams]

22
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,250
That's Hitomi!

23
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:28,250
No, please! Mom! Help!

24
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:35,750
[MOLE MAN yelling] Stop!
Back off! Get away from me!

25
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,458
Quit, you stupid bird! Shoo!

26
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,333
Well, this is a surprise.

27
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,125
I thought your game
was petty thievery.

28
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,958
If you've moved on to
hurting innocent women,

29
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:48,958
you'll pay.

30
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,333
Wait. Allen!

31
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,625
Enough!

32
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,916
[MOLE MAN groans]

33
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,416
[gasps]

34
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,291
Excuse me, miss,
are you all right?

35
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,583
You're not hurt, are you?

36
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,083
This is an awfully
dangerous place

37
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,625
to come alone.

38
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,333
What could have brought
you here, I wonder?

39
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,500
Don't worry, you're safe now.

40
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,916
C'mon. It's time to go.

41
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,625
[whimpers] Amano!

42
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:24,125
It happened so fast,
I didn't know what to do!

43
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,958
Thank you for saving me.

44
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,208
[ALLEN]
Uh--

45
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,833
[VAN]
Hitomi!

46
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:34,083
Whatever you've done,
you're gonna regret it!

47
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,083
It's not terribly wise
to threaten someone

48
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,166
you know nothing about.

49
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,083
Halt!

50
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,166
[VAN grunts]

51
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,750
[ALLEN]
Draw that blade and you'll die.

52
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:42,833
Oh, yeah?

53
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,250
[ALLEN]
To unsheathe a sword means

54
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,166
offering your life
to the battlefield.

55
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,875
As a knight, it is my sworn
duty to respond in kind.

56
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,000
That was foolhardy.

57
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,583
[growls]

58
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,583
[growls]

59
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,291
[VAN grunts]

60
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,375
You wield your
sword well. However...

61
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,291
[VAN grunts]

62
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,958
[ALLEN]
You aren't aggressive enough.

63
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,000
Still, it would be
a shame to kill you.

64
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,916
A blow with the flat
of the blade should serve.

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,416
Who are these two?

66
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,250
And what are they doing here?

67
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,958
[DILANDAU]
Let me get this straight.

68
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,708
Despite our overwhelming
tactical advantage,

69
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:55,208
you let those bumpkins
damage two of my Aiseides?

70
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,041
[DALLET, SHESTA]
Please, forgive us, sir!

71
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,583
Step forward!

72
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,166
[groans]

73
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,125
Your units were outfitted
with stealth cloaks,

74
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,416
and still you failed!

75
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,916
Do you know how
this makes me look?

76
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,750
[DALLET, SHESTA]
We beg you for forgiveness!

77
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,750
I'm only going to say this once.

78
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,958
There's no room for incompetence
in my Dragonslayers.

79
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,750
Have I made myself clear?

80
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,750
[DALLET, SHESTA]
Sir!

81
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,083
[FOLKEN]
That was excessive, Dilandau.

82
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:28,250
It was hardly necessary to
raze Fanelia to the ground.

83
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,333
I expect the stealth
cloaks to be more

84
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,375
effectively utilized
in the future.

85
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,583
[DILANDAU] That's rich
coming from you, Folken.

86
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,125
After all, weren't you the
one who sold out Fanelia

87
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:40,125
in the first place?

88
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,458
The next time you
want to tell me

89
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,541
how to do my job, maybe
you should go out there

90
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,250
and fight the battle yourself.

91
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:50,875
[FOLKEN chuckles] Consider it
constructive criticism.

92
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,708
So, is there a reason
we're in this room?

93
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,875
Right. You've never
been here before.

94
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,458
[gasps] That's Emperor Dornkirk!

95
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:14,000
[DORNKIRK] Your work is
not yet finished, Folken.

96
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,666
The dragon's shadow remains,
shrouding the future

97
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,250
of the Zaibach Empire in
darkness. It must be stopped.

98
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,125
The dragon has fled from
the wreckage of Fanelia.

99
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,875
You must capture
it at all costs!

100
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,416
Yes. I shall see
to it, Your Majesty.

101
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,541
You can rely on me.

102
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,916
[DORNKIRK] There's another
matter to discuss.

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,916
Specifically, that
pillar of light

104
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,958
which my Destiny Prognostication
Engine failed to predict.

105
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:45,458
This may be evidence of a
new power entering the fray.

106
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:50,416
It and all unknown variables
must be contained.

107
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,541
Look to the Asturian frontier.

108
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,291
That is where you
will find the dragon.

109
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,625
Seize it as quickly as you can.

110
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,916
Our hope of reawakening the
legendary power of Atlantis

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,041
depends upon your success!

112
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,416
[HITOMI grunts, gasps]

113
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,666
[HITOMI]
Amano, is that you?

114
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,000
You're finally awake.

115
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,208
Uh... What happened?

116
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,041
You collapsed while running.

117
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,583
I'd guess you're
probably a little anemic.

118
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:30,666
Oh, really? How long was I out?
I had the weirdest dream.

119
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,083
Weird how?

120
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:35,833
[HITOMI] It's hard to explain,
but it was really sad.

121
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,625
In the dream, I thought
I'd never see you again.

122
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,583
That's just crazy, Kanzaki.

123
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,833
I'm always gonna be here,
right by your side.

124
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,833
[HITOMI]
You promise?

125
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:49,583
[HITOMI gasps]

126
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,125
Good, you're finally awake.

127
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,250
[gasps]

128
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,791
[KIO] Little lady's up
from her beauty nap, huh?

129
00:08:55,875 --> 00:09:01,416
[CRUSADERS chuckling]

130
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,625
Mornin', cutey.
'D'ja sleep well?

131
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,500
[whimpering]

132
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,250
All right, all right.
Quiet down.

133
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,333
You're scaring the poor girl.

134
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,750
As if your ugly mugs
weren't bad enough.

135
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,541
Aw, you don't mean that, do ya?

136
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,291
[KATZ] Actually, I'm
surprised she didn't faint

137
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,458
after seeing Pyle.

138
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:24,500
--[PYLE] Up yours!
--[CRUSADERS laughing]

139
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,333
So I wasn't really
on Earth after all.

140
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,625
Which means I'm still
stuck here on Gaea.

141
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:37,041
[sobs] Amano... Yukari... Mom...

142
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,583
Hey, what's the matter?

143
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,958
If you need to talk, I'd be
more than happy to lend an ear.

144
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,458
It's the least I can do
as a knight of Asturia.

145
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,375
I'm Allen Schezar.

146
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,000
Consider yourself a
guest of this castle.

147
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:53,125
As its commander, that makes
you my responsibility.

148
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,375
I'll give my all
to keep you safe.

149
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:59,541
That is my duty, not only as
a knight, but also as a man.

150
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,041
Thank you, Allen.

151
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,291
I'll never understand
how he spouts that crap

152
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,416
with a straight face.

153
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,291
Guess the boss just
has a gift for it.

154
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,625
[GADDES]
Commander!

155
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,125
You wanted us to tell you
when the boy was awake.

156
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,583
[ALLEN]
Show him in.

157
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,416
Well, go on.

158
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,916
It's Van!

159
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,333
[ALLEN]
Are you serious?

160
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,833
You're telling me this girl
came from the Mystic Moon?

161
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,833
I think you can understand
why I find that

162
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,958
rather difficult to believe.

163
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,166
[VAN] It's the truth.
I don't know how to prove it,

164
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,083
so you'll just have
to take our word.

165
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,083
I suppose I will.

166
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:43,208
[ALLEN] And seeing as you're
the king of Fanelia...

167
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,541
I have no reason to doubt you.

168
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,416
What is your name, miss?

169
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:54,250
[gasps] My name's Hitomi.
Hitomi Kanzaki, that is.

170
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:59,083
Ah, "Hitomi." That has quite
a pleasant ring to it.

171
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,208
Look, I apologize for
entering your country

172
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:04,958
without permission, but
I want my Guymelef back.

173
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,416
Return Escaflowne to me, now!

174
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,333
If I give it back,
what will you do?

175
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,500
I'll go back to Fanelia.

176
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,541
We were sent here in
the middle of a battle.

177
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,750
I don't know who our enemy was,
but I must protect my people.

178
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:17,666
It's too late.

179
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,291
What?

180
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,958
Fanelia has been
completely destroyed.

181
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,166
The entire country has
burned to the ground.

182
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,791
[gasps]

183
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,875
No... That's not true!

184
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,166
I heard about it
from some of our

185
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,916
traveling merchants
who saw first-hand.

186
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,583
I'm very sorry.

187
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,875
What happened? Who would
do something like that?

188
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,833
I know it's difficult,
but if you talk to me,

189
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,875
I just might be able to help.

190
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,333
I'm so sorry.

191
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:46,250
No. I can't believe it.
Fanelia's gone?

192
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,041
[rumbling]

193
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,791
What in the world is that?

194
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:54,208
[gasps] A Zaibach Empire
floating fortress!

195
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,041
[CRUSADER 3B]
Guymelefs!

196
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,333
[CRUSADER 3C]
Incoming! Zaibach forces!

197
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,083
It's them, Van!

198
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,500
Those are the giants
that attacked Fanelia!

199
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,291
[gasps]

200
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,583
Commander Allen,
we're being invaded!

201
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,666
[ALLEN] Calm down,
Gaddes. It's all right.

202
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,833
I think if they had intended
to attack the castle,

203
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,291
they would have done so by now.

204
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,625
Keep our soldiers back.

205
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:25,958
[GADDES]
Yes, sir.

206
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:26,708
[ALLEN]
Hitomi.

207
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:27,916
Yes?

208
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,708
I need you to do me
a favor and stay here

209
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,375
while I handle this, okay?

210
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,958
Sure.

211
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,791
[ALLEN]
Van Fanel. For now,

212
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:39,708
you should stay put, too.
For your own safety.

213
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,791
Well, then. See you in a bit.

214
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,833
[DILANDAU]
Is this some kind of joke?

215
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:56,000
It looks more like
a fort than a castle.

216
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,750
All right then! Raise the flags!

217
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,458
[GADDES] I already told ya,
I can't let ya outta here.

218
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,125
[VAN] I need to see
the faces of the men

219
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,166
who burned my home!

220
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,625
Why? What good would that do?

221
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,333
I'll be able to etch
them into my mind

222
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,916
so I'll never forget.

223
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,750
And no matter what it takes,
I'll make them pay.

224
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,958
I dunno...

225
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:20,041
[DILANDAU] I'd like to request
food, water, and weapons.

226
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,500
We're in the middle
of urgent maneuvers

227
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,041
and need rations.

228
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,250
Of course. We'll do anything
within our power to help you.

229
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,500
Just for a bit.
Please let us out.

230
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,791
[GADDES]
All right.

231
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,541
You can take a peek,
but that's all, Van. Wait!

232
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,000
Ah, hey!

233
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,166
[grunts]

234
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,625
[DILANDAU]
One more thing, Sir Allen.

235
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:39,833
[gasps]

236
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,166
You haven't come
across a strange

237
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,625
Guymelef in this area,
by any chance?

238
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,625
[ALLEN]
No. Nothing out of the ordinary.

239
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,166
Why, is that what your
"maneuvers" are about?

240
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,666
Deploying a floating
fortress is pretty drastic.

241
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,708
[DILANDAU]
Heh. Possibly.

242
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,333
Does this have anything
to do with the attacks

243
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,041
on the western kingdom, Fanelia?

244
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,416
What, do you mean
that pile of huts

245
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,458
that calls itself a kingdom?

246
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,333
For all we know, it was
destroyed by the dragons

247
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,041
that wander through the
valley on the lookout

248
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,666
for their next meal.

249
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,000
I would say it's a fitting end

250
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,208
to such a backwater
nation, wouldn't you?

251
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,208
[HITOMI, VAN gasp]

252
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,416
[DILANDAU]
At any rate.

253
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,000
It was nothing more
than a land of cowards

254
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,708
whose king is now in hiding.

255
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,958
No one will consider
it a great loss.

256
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,333
[laughs]

257
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,333
[VAN] What's cowardly is
hiding your face in battle!

258
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,583
Uh?

259
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,750
I've never seen an outfit
like that before.

260
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,791
Tell me, where is it
you're from, girl?

261
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,625
Tch!

262
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,333
[whimpers]

263
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,708
[ALLEN] Please, pardon my
new lover's appearance.

264
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,958
[ALLEN]
This exotic beauty is Hitomi.

265
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,750
We met in one of the
eastern countries.

266
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,791
[HITOMI]
Ah...

267
00:14:57,041 --> 00:15:01,916
I just can't keep away.
I hope you can forgive me.

268
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,208
It appears your reputation
is well deserved.

269
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,458
Although, I'm hardly impressed.
I hope you have higher standards

270
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,666
when it comes to our provisions.

271
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,875
I thought their eyes were gonna

272
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,791
bug outta their heads
for a second there!

273
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,541
That'll happen if you've
never seen the boss

274
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,958
pull that stunt before.

275
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,416
Hell, even when
you have seen it,

276
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,416
you can still get
caught off guard.

277

[ORT, KIO chuckle]

278
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,291
[ALLEN]
That took some improvising,

279
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,875
but we made it through.

280
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,541
I do hope you can
forgive me, though.

281
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:29,708
I fear I may have given you a
bad reputation in the Empire.

282
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,166
Gaddes, come to my room
after they're stocked.

283
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,125
[GADDES]
Yes, sir!

284
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:37,791
[HITOMI]
Can it be? Is he the one?

285
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,666
[DILANDAU] They'll give
themselves away soon enough.

286
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,500
There's no need
for us to rush in.

287
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,583
[ZAIBACH SOLDIER 3A]
Yes, sir!

Good.

290
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,333
Keep everyone on standby,
ready to deploy.

291

[GATTY]
Yes, sir!

292
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,250
Now, Allen Schezar.

293
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,041
You'll soon learn
what a mistake it was

294
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,125
to make an enemy of me.

295
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,458

Wow, I forgot I
had these with me.

299
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,791
I know it's hard,
but try to cheer up.

300
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,291
Sulking isn't gonna
do you any good.

301
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,625
There, you see?
I drew the hermit card.

302
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,125
That means you just
have to be patient

303
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,083
and wait for the
right opportunity.

304
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:50,750
Oh, really? How do you know?

305
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,375
'Cause these are tarot cards.

That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

There's no way

to get your mind off everything.

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,541
[HITOMI]
Uh...

320
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,416
What's that?

321
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,125
I don't know.

322
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:50,791
[MOLE MAN grunts]
Aw, dammit. Nope.

323
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,625
This doesn't look right at all.

324
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:53,125
[HITOMI yelps]

325
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,250
[yelps]

326
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,958
It's that
freaky-looking pervert!

327
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,208
Wait, who?

328
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,875
What? You're saying they
managed to sneak out?

329
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:03,000
Yes. And we have no
idea where they went.

330
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:07,875
I've got a guess. Well.
Prep Scherazade for battle!

331
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,125
[MOLE MAN]
Whatever you might think,

332
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,625
I'm no pervert--
just a poor thief.

333
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,666
A while back, I screwed up
and got caught in the castle.

334
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,208
That's no big problem, really,
me being a mole and all.

335
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,333
So I did what moles
do best and dug a hole

336
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,250
like this one last night and
went out for a little walk.

337
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,458
That's when I saw that
pretty stone of yours.

338
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,708
And of course, old habits
die hard, you know.

339
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,958
So that's why you
jumped me in the forest?

340
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,666
That wasn't nice
of me, so I thought

341
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,458
I'd give you that
bag as an apology.

342
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,125
I'm guessing it
came from Fanelia

343
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,625
the same way we did.

344
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,375
Who cares about that?
We need to get to my Guymelef.

345
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,625
Your Majesty.

346
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,416
Haven't you ever heard
"patience is a virtue"?

347
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,041
Besides, it's right above us.

348
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,166
[MOLE MAN]
There, y'see?

349
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,333
Right here in the
Guymelef hangar.

350
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,583
[gasps]

351
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,875
[MOLE MAN] Whew! That is
a magnificent specimen!

352
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,208
Ispano design, unless
I miss my guess.

353
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,875
Now what are you gonna do?

354
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:08,333
Get out of here and go
back to Fanelia, obviously.

355
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,916
[HITOMI]
Knock it off, Van!

356
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,083
Didn't you hear anything
Allen said to you?

357
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,375
[HITOMI]
Stop it! Get back here!

358
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,291
Well, now.

359
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,500
I could have sworn I told you
to stay in the castle, Van.

360
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:58,708
It's Allen!

361
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,000
But if you're so adamant
about leaving here,

362
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:04,041
I suppose there's nothing I
can say to change your mind.

363
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,500
Of course, you'll have to go
through me on your way out.

364
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,291
[growls]

365
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,916
How many hits
do you think the kid

366
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,916
can take before he cries?

367
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,541
[CRUSADER 3E]
One if he's lucky!

368
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:25,666
[HITOMI] Stop it, Van! What's
the point in fighting Allen?

369
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,125
[GADDES]
Careful, now.

370
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,333
Sorry. Thank you.

371
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,375
You should let those
two duke it out.

372
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:31,458
But--!

373
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,166
[GADDES]
Trust me. It's gonna be fine.

374
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,541
Hey!

375
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,208
[MOLE MAN] Step right up
and place your bets!

376
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,541
No need to be shy, men!

377
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,541
Your money is in good
hands, I guarantee it!

378
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,875
Are you sure you
wanna do this?

379
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,416
It's not too late to back down.

380
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,041
Let's go!

381
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,083
Well, I gave the kid a chance.

382
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,666
[CRUSADER 3F] A hundred says
the boss takes him down

383
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,750
on the first swing!

384
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:01,833
[CRUSADER 3G]
Two hundred on the boss!

385
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:02,833
[CRUSADER 3H]
Hey, hey!

386
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,333
Shouldn't somebody
bet on the kid?

387
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,458
[CRUSADER 3I]
Sure, if you're not attached

388
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,208
to your money, go right ahead!

389
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,333
What about you?

390
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,166
Where's your money
going in this fight?

391
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,041
Well...

392
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:17,541

[panting]

394
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,458
You're going to have to be
more aggressive than that, Van!

395
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,708
Hey, he actually blocked it!

396
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,166
Ha. Beginner's luck.

397
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,500
[ALLEN]
What's wrong?

398
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,708
I know you didn't learn
to hold back from Balgus!

399
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,708
How the hell do you
know who Balgus is?

400
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:50,875
[ALLEN]
You're kidding.

401
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,458
He's one of Gaea's
three master swordsmen!

402
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:57,958
And more specifically,

403
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,541
he taught me everything I know!

[yells]

407

I can't believe he
blocked another one!

[ALLEN]
That's it!

No, I'm falling!

defeat and come out

413
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,041
of your Guymelef peacefully.

00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:45,833
Balgus. I'm still
not good enough.

415
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:54,458
Ah--

416
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:58,000
[ALLEN]
He struck me?

417
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,291
When did he manage to do that?

418
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:04,875
Van.

00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:08,125
Ah--

Hey, what's the matter?

421
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:13,583
Allen, you have to run for it!

422
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:15,791
They're attacking again!

00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:39,291
Allen! Above you!

426
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:43,750
[ALLEN] The castle's fallen.
We're withdrawing.

427
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:48,000
[DILANDAU laughs]
Oh, yes! Burn! Burn!
