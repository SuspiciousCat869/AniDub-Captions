1
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,041
[HITOMI]
Was it all just a dream?

2
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:53,750
Or was it a vision?

3
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,291
Thanks to Allen,

4
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:58,416
we were able to rescue Van from
Zaibach's floating fortress.

5
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,916
Though I still had questions

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,291
about the man Van called
his older brother.

7
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,375
Now we're headed for
the city of Palas,

8
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,583
capital of Asturia.

9
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,291
[TEO]
Altitude, 4,000!

10
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,666
[KIO] Right! We've crossed
the Chatal Mountains.

11
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,791
[HITOMI]
Allen wasn't very happy

12
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,500
about the reading I
did for him earlier.

13
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,791
[HITOMI]
He seems so distant.

14
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,250
I wonder if he hates me now.

15
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,583
Our altitude is
2,000 and falling.

16
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,458
We're nearing our destination.

17
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,875
Hey Katz, stay sharp!

18
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,583
Looks like we've got
some turbulence ahead.

19
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,083
[KATZ]
I know that!

20
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:45,333
Uh, Commander?

21
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,208
[ALLEN]
Uh. What is it?

22
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,041
We should be arriving
at Palas pretty soon.

23
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,500
There something wrong?

24
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:54,416
It's nothing.
I'm just distracted.

25
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,083
[gasps]

26
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,250
[ALLEN]
I have good news.

27
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,000
We'll be on the ground
again before long.

28
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,458
We're nearing Palas.

29
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,916
To be honest,
I'm a little nervous.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,625
There's nothing to
be worried about.

31
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,958
I'm sure we're in
for a warm welcome.

32
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:16,041
Asturia is my country,
and Palas is her capital.

33
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,125
Although...

34
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,375
Huh?

35
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,500
That special power of
yours is quite impressive,

36
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,083
but I think it best
you keep it a secret.

37
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,625
A girl who is both
beautiful and powerful?

38
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,208
I fear you'd make much
too of a tempting target.

39
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,958
Heh.

40
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,041
I'll leave landing
preparations to you.

41
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,041
Find me if you need me.

42
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,416
Roger that.

43
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,625
I think I might faint.

44
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,541
[HITOMI yelps]

45
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,041
[ORT] What're you doin'
in this area, kitty?

46
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,875
We're gonna be landin'
soon, you know?

47
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,541
Yeah, but I need
to find King Van.

48
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,875
The King, huh? Easy.

49
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,625
He's back there,
with his Guymelef.

50
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,083
[MERLE laughs]

51
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,583
[ORT]
Hey!

52
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,541
There'll be some turbulence
when we descend. Be careful.

53
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,750
I'm always careful!

54
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,333
[MERLE]
Hm... Uh!

55
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,916
[laughs]

56
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,708
How, Brother?

57
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,000
How could you turn
your back on us?

58
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,416
King Van looks so sad.

59
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:09,333
[ALL chatting]

60
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:12,083
I'm headin' into town
tonight. Who's with me?!

61
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,083
Look at that water!
It goes on forever!

62
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,791
That's the ocean? I've never
seen the ocean before.

63
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,583
Yeah. Me neither, actually.

64
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,208
Huh, I guess the sea
smells the same

65
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,500
no matter what
planet you're on.

66
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,333
[MILLERNA]
Allen!

67
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,583
[MILLERNA]
Whoa!

68
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,125
[MILLERNA] Why didn't you let
anyone know you were coming?

69
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,791
You cad!

70
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,000
Princess Millerna.

71
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:52,125
It's delightful to see
you as always, Highness.

72
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,875
But why are you
wearing trousers?

73
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,833
Have you ever tried riding
a horse in a dress?

74
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,583
Honestly, why didn't you
send a message ahead?

75
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,750
We could've arranged a
proper welcome for you.

76
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:06,375
[ALLEN] My apologies. We, uh,
came in a bit of a hurry.

77
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,791
[MILLERNA]
We?

78
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,625
Who's that young man?

79
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,500
May I introduce His Majesty,
King Van of Fanelia.

80
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,083
Oh! I see.

81
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,833
That explains it. I could
have sworn that I recognized

82
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,791
his face from
somewhere before.

83
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,750
I have actually been to Fanelia.

84
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,166
So, as it happens,

85
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,375
this isn't the first time
that I've met His Majesty.

86
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,208
I found Fanelia to be such
a beautiful, lush country.

87
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:32,541
I still remember that
visit quite clearly.

88
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,291
The castle had a blue roof.

89
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,666
And there was a garden in the
back. That's where you were.

90
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,500
You and your brother.

91
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,583
[MILLERNA]
Folken, right?

92
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,833
I always thought he seemed
like such a nice person.

93
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:56,625
If I may, I'm afraid I have
to ask a favor of you.

94
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,000
Please, ask anything!

95
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,958
You know I'm always
happy to help, Allen.

96
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,833
You okay, King Van?

97
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:04,916
Well, you see,

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,208
I really ought to
get to the castle

99
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,833
as swiftly as I possibly can.

100
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,208
Oh, yes. Absolutely!

101
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,416
As a matter of fact,

102
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,625
Father mentioned that
there was something

103
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,375
he wanted to
discuss with you.

104
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,625
You're welcome to take
my horse if you'd like.

105
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,541
[ALLEN]
Thank you, I will.

106
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,500
I'll see you at
the castle. H'ya!

107
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,291
[HITOMI]
The knight and the princess.

108
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,833
Basically the perfect couple.

109
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:36,166
Well, I suppose we should
be going. You there, girl.

110
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,958
You can take care of Allen's
things, can't you now?

111
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,833
Uh! Uh... Who? Me?

112
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:42,708
[MERLE laughs]

113
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,791
Of course. Is that a problem?

114
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,666
Actually, she's
not a handmaiden.

115
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,666
She's here with me.

116
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,000
[MILLERNA]
Oh.

117
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,583
[MERLE growls] I would
say she's here with Allen!

118
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:52,833
[MILLERNA]
You're joking.

119
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,125
Uh. You thought I was a
servant? Well, I'm not.

120
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,333
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

121
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,041
I saw your strange clothing,
and I just assumed.

122
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,791
My mistake.

123
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,333
Handmaidens dress
better than that!

124
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:06,333
I'll pull your tail!

125
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,291
[MERLE laughs]

126
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,666
I've met all kinds of people.

127
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,291
We get folk from everywhere
here in Asturia.

128
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,500
But I don't think I've ever seen
anyone quite like you before.

129
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,458
No, I would bet money
that you haven't.

130
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:19,916
I doubt you get very many
visitors from the Mystic--

131
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,250
Oops.

132
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,625
Way to go.

133
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,666
[ALLEN]
The Zaibach Empire

134
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,916
attacked our fortress in a clear
violation of our treaty.

135
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This is not the
action of an ally.

136
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,375
We must ask ourselves:

137
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,583
How long before they
attack Asturia in force?

138
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,458
Shall we ready our
defenses, King Aston?

139
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,166
[KING ASTON] Considering your
recent actions I can only assume

140
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,208
it is your intention to bring
disaster upon our country.

141
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,458
[gasps]

142
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,041
You would invite
the wrath of the

143
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:57,791
Zaibach Empire for the sake
of one insignificant outpost?

144
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,375
Are you out of your mind?

145
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,791
Uh! Chivalry demands we
protect the King of Fanelia,

146
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,166
whose country was destroyed
by those Zaibach traitors.

147
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,750
[FOLKEN]
That's quite an accusation.

148
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:07,833
[ALLEN]
Huh?

149
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,583
[FOLKEN]
I'm sorry,

150
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,833
but you seem to be the victim
of a misunderstanding.

151
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,791
As I'm sure you
will come to see.

152
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,375
Who is this man?

153
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,791
[KING ASTON] Allen Schezar, I
would like to introduce Folken.

154
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,833
Zaibach's own Strategos.

155
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,875
Did we come too late?

156
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:30,166
[ALLEN] Zaibach may already have
secured the king's cooperation.

157
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,541
[FOLKEN]
King Aston.

158
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,916
The truth of the matter
is that it was Fanelia

159
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,333
who launched a surprise
attack against us.

160
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,625
Really? This is the first I've
heard of any surprise attack.

161
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,583
Even so, it is true.
Now, here is my proposal.

162
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,500
Hand over the king of Fanelia
and his Guymelef to us.

163
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,958
If you do that,

164
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,916
then perhaps we can overlook
this unfortunate incident.

165
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,166
I would hate for anything
to endanger our alliance.

166
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,125
We are happy to count Asturia
among our loyal friends.

167
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,458
I hope that will not change as a
result of this misunderstanding.

[KING ASTON]
Mm-mm.

169
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,375
I'm glad we could come
to an agreement so quickly.

[KING ASTON]
If you love your country,

172
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,541
you will turn over the king
and his Guymelef at once,

173
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,500
and I expect no more
reckless behavior.

174
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,791
It takes more than chivalry
to protect a country, Allen.

with a strong

179
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,625
We don't want any lingering
aroma of sweat and animals.

Um! Okay.

[HITOMI] I'm happy to
finally get a bath, and all.

[MILLERNA]
You clean up well.

That dress looks
wonderful on you!

You look good enough
to be a handmaiden now.

189
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,375
Do you want to fight?
Is that it?

190
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,083
Aw, is someone a little
self-conscious?

191
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,416
Are you sure you don't mind
me borrowing this, though?

192
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,333
It's such a beautiful dress.

193
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:14,416
It wouldn't do to have you seen
out and about in your clothes.

194
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,166
It might reflect
poorly on Allen,

195
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,833
and we wouldn't want that.

[HITOMI growls]

out of her way to insult me.

Uh! E-Excuse me?
Aren't those my clothes?

Yes, of course.

She's disposing of
them for you, dear.

You can't do that!
Give them back!

What's the matter?

203
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,708
You may have as many new
dresses as you would like.

204
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,291
You only have to ask.

No, it isn't that.

These clothes have
sentimental value to me.

I appreciate you lending
me this dress.

208

I'm happy to wear it. But,
I'd like to keep my things.

Uh... Huh.

00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,583
I get the impression that
there's a longer story

behind this than I've heard.

212
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,041
I'll have to sit
Allen down later

213
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,208
and have him tell
me everything.

He says we should go down
to the bazaar without him.

It isn't very gentlemanly of him
to break his word like that.

to be given new life,

319
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,375
at the hands of Emperor.

320
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,458
[HITOMI panting]

321
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,875
[MERLE]
Why you running? What's wrong?

322
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,625
I had a vision, a bad one.

323
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,083
Cut it out!

324
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,000
I don't like when you say
stuff like that. It's scary.

325
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,458
Excuse me, sir.
Which way to the harbor?

326
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,500
The same direction
you're facing.

327
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,666
Thank you!

328
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,125
[MERLE gasping]

329
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:55,041
[SHESTA panting] Hold on,
Lord Dilandau! Please wait.

330
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:59,291
What about Lord Folken's order
not to leave the anchorage?!

331
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,416
Not an issue. I wasn't
planning to leave the Vione.

332
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,041
[DILANDAU chuckles]

333
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,208
[DILANDAU]
Van!

334
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,166
[FOLKEN] Van, you are
my family, my brother.

335
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,916
The same blood runs
through our veins.

336
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,500
I can read your heart as
easily as I can read my own.

337
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:35,458
This is a hard world for
a gentle soul like yours.

338
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,750
This world, where man
fights against man.

339
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,375
Where it seems every
living creature struggles

340
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,250
to take the life of another.

341
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:47,583
We kill beasts. We kill
dragons. We kill other men.

342
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:51,750
Fighting begets fighting and
the slaughter begins anew.

343
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,916
Such is the way of the world.

344
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,250
From what I can see,

345
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,875
the Zaibach Empire's doing
most of the fighting.

346
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,458
[FOLKEN]
Hmph. The difference is

347
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,500
that we are fighting to bring
an end to such conflict.

348
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,708
To establish a new order,
one with peace at its heart.

349
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:10,125
This is a just war
we fight. A holy war.

350
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,333
That's it?

351
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,750
You're fighting to put
an end to fighting?

352
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,833
That's ridiculous.
It doesn't work that way!

353
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:20,166
[FOLKEN]
Van. I want you to join us.

354
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,416
Come with me now. Together
we'll create a new world.

355
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,625
[VAN]
Brother...

356
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,833
[HITOMI, MERLE panting]

357
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,333
[HITOMI]
Something's wrong.

358
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:35,916
I can feel it!
I have to hurry!

359
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,416
[SHESTA]
Lord Dilandau!

360
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,708
He's got his Energist
on the maximum setting.

361
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:44,000
How far is he attempting
to shoot the Crima Claw?

362
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,291
[DILANDAU]
I'm coming for you, Van!

363
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:52,375
[MERLE]
Huh?!

364
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,250
[HITOMI]
Hold this for me!

365
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,750
[MERLE gasping]

366
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,500
Further! Reach him, my claw!

367
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,375
Van is going to die today!

368
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,166
[HITOMI panting]

369
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,000
[HITOMI]
Van!

370
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,458
[screams]

371
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:14,791
[gasps]

372
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,208
[HITOMI]
Look out!

373
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:20,791
[DILANDAU gasps]

374
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,291
Lord Dilandau!

375
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,333
Uh!

376
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:36,083
[SHESTA] Lord Dilandau! That
looked bad! Are you all right?

377
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,041
[DILANDAU]
Damn that girl.

378
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,041
[HITOMI panting]

379
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,000
Van.

380
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,375
Hitomi?

381
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,208
Thank you.

382
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,916
It looks like you saved me.

383
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,208
[panting]

384
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,916
Just barely.
I'm glad I made it.

385
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
[FOLKEN] Dilandau, you fool.
How dare you interfere!

386
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,375
[VAN]
Hey, Folken!

387
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,666
What was that about putting
an end to all fighting?

388
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,250
[FOLKEN] I never intended for
you to be attacked here today.

389
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:21,583
[VAN]
Is that all you have to say?

390
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,500
[HITOMI]
That's Van's older brother.

391
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,375
The guy from the fortress.

392
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:28,458
[MERLE panting]
King Van!

393
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,916
Don't go running
off like that.

394
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Do you know how
worried I've been?

395
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:37,083
She keeps saying
the weirdest things!

396
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:47,166
Van Fanel, King of Fanelia, if
you will please come with us.

397
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,041
King Aston wishes to see you.

398
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:52,500
So he sent the guard?
Well, that's kinda rude!

399
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:02,166
The king is waiting.
Shall we be on our way?

400
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,916
[KING ASTON]
Welcome, Van of Fanelia.

401
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,791
I extend you warmest greetings
on behalf of all Asturia.

402
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,000
I hope you will rest
easy in my land,

403
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,000
knowing that you
are among friends.

404
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,916
As proof of our friendship,
I ask a favor.

405
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,833
I am interested to see both
your skill as a fighter

406
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,875
and the power of your Guymelef.

407
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:28,208
Perhaps you'd be so kind as
to give us a demonstration?

408
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,375
I'm sure everything
will be all right, Allen.

409
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:31,291
Don't worry.

410
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,791
Father knows what he's doing.

411
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,875
There's no need to
look so serious.

412
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,333
[HITOMI gasps]

413
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,458
I know that Guymelef.
It's Sajima's.

414
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,458
He's a bounty hunter,
not a knight.

415
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:49,625
Just greedy lout who
fights for money.

416
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:58,375
[HITOMI] My heart, it's racing!
There's something wrong here.

417
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:01,416
I can't believe I'm actually
seeing an Ispano Guymelef.

418
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,250
I've heard rumors
of its magnificence,

419
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,958
and it seems they
weren't exaggerated

420
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:07,500
so this will be an
interesting fight, indeed.

421
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:08,875
[KING ASTON]
Perhaps just looking at it

422
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:10,875
will be enough to
satisfy you, Meiden.

423
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,375
[MEIDEN chuckles]

424
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,583
I will admit, the sight
of it is enough to set

425
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:16,583
even the coolest
merchant's blood aboil.

426
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:19,666
But as everyone knows, you can't
tell a Guymelef's true worth

427
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,250
until you've seen it in combat.

428
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,666
I do wish we had more
satisfactory opponents

429
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,833
for him, though.

430
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:27,083
Like Allen. Why not
put him in the ring?

431
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:30,500
Ha! Allen isn't the
only fighter in Asturia.

432
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:34,041
Watch. I'm sure you will
not be disappointed.

433
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:48,791
[HITOMI] Was I wrong? Was what
happened earlier just a fluke?

434
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,458
Is this what that
horrible vision

435
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:53,083
was really warning me about?

436
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,750
"Proof of our friendship," huh?

437
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:13,916
[NARRATOR]
Escaflowne.

438
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,958
[MILLERNA] I would be willing
to give up everything for you.

439
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,958
The city is burning
because of you!
