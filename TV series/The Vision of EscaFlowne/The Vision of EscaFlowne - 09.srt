1
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:53,083
Amano. I am right here.

2
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,708
It's true.

3
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:19,125
You have wings like an angel.

4
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,291
[MERLE] Stop it!
You leave him alone!

5
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,791
Quit staring at him!

6
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,708
Why? What's wrong?

7
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,458
[HITOMI]
This feather.

8
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,625
Please don't cry.
Okay, Mother?

9
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:43,041
It was present when something
incredibly tragic happened.

10
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,708
[TEO] Hey, watch it!
That was pretty close!

11
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,333
Sorry about that!

12
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,791
Commander.

13
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,125
This route is about to get
a whole lot tighter soon.

14
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,750
Maybe we should just
look for another way.

15
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,083
Negative. We stay
on this course.

16
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,166
But, sir.

17
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,958
[ALLEN]
Look, I know it's dangerous.

18
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,208
But it's also the only
way to make it into Freid

19
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,333
without being
spotted by Zaibach.

20
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,875
I'm not worried.

21
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:25,041
I know I've got a crew who can
pull off a stunt like this.

22
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,375
Thanks, Boss.

23
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,666
Hey, ya dirtbags!
Stay sharp now!

24
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,375
We're gonna kick
some Zaibach ass!

25
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,416
So let's make it through
this valley, okay?

26
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,333
[CREW]
Aye!

27
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,291
[ALLEN] Van, I hope
you're coming, too.

28
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,166
We'll see you in Freid.

29
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,708
I'm sorry, Eries.

30
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,166
[ERIES]
Millerna!

31
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,416
[MILLERNA]
I've made up my mind.

32
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,000
I have to help him.

33
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,791
[ERIES]
Please. Don't do this.

34
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,208
You can't help yourself,
let alone Allen.

35
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,083
Would you stop treating
me like a child?

36
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,250
If you haven't noticed,
I'm an adult.

37
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,541
For once in my life,

38
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,416
I wish you and Father
would treat me as such,

39
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,791
instead of continuing to
make my decisions for me

40
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,375
without asking how I feel.

41
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,583
The choices we make
are for your own good.

42
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,833
Like forcing me to give
up my medical studies?

43
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,000
You were wasting your time.

44
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,875
Honestly, what use
does a princess have

45
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,708
for such knowledge?

46
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,583
[MILLERNA]
To help people, why else?

47
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,833
To comfort them and
make them feel better!

48
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,500
You can still do
that right here,

49
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,000
by carrying out your duties.

50
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,375
If what you want is
to help your people,

51
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,750
then don't run away.

52
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,416
Don't put Allen above all.

53
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,458
But I love him! Can't
you understand that?

54
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,750
[MILLERNA] Like I said,
I've made up my mind.

55
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,500
Goodbye, Eries.

56
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,750
Take care of yourself.
I will miss you.

57
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,166
[LEON] The Draconians.
The winged people.

58
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,041
The descendants of Atlantis.

59
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,416
The accursed clan.

60
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,416
[HITOMI]
What? "Draconians"?

61
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,208
[LEON] Avoid their
kind at all costs.

62
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,916
They will end your world.

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,750
Just as they
destroyed Atlantis.

64
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,916
It's you.

65
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,625
[HITOMI]
This is Fanelia.

66
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,750
[MERLE]
No, Prince Van!

67
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,625
Please don't do this!
I'm begging you!

68
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:48,458
[VILLAGERS yelling]

69
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,833
[VAN]
Geez, you're flaky!

70
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:50,916
Just a few minutes ago,

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,250
you were the one telling
me to go for it.

72
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,083
[MERLE] That was before I
realized how high up we'd be!

73
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,625
Don't worry, 'cause
I'm gonna be fine!

74
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,916
No, don't do it!

75
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:12,041
[YURIZEN] Wine tastes better
after a victory, does it not?

76
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,791
Steel yourselves for
the final battle at dawn,

77
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,416
and then we'll drink our fill

78
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,166
after we've taken
the enemy's castle!

79
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,708
[SOLDIERS cheering]

80
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,208
[HITOMI]
Soldiers from Fanelia.

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,833
[HITOMI]
Escaflowne?

82
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,208
[GOAU]
Balgus?

83
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,458
[BALGUS]
Sire?

84
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,875
[GOAU] When this war ends,
will you leave us?

85
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,416
[BALGUS]
Yes.

86
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,791
With all due respect, I'd like
to hone my spirit once more.

87
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,833
[GOAU]
I see. You will be missed.

88
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:48,000
[BALGUS] I'll never forget
your kindness, Sire.

89
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,750
It's all right, Balgus.

90
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,666
Besides, I too
want you to master

91
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,041
the ways of the warrior.

92
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,500
Once you've done so,

93
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,500
I hope you'll return home
and take what you've learned

94
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,791
and use it for the
benefit of Fanelia.

95
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,500
Yes, Sire.

96
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,500
[GOAU]
That woman.

97
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:40,875
She's a Draconian!

98
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:45,541
A descendant of Atlantis,
those demons of legend!

99
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,750
Run! Flee, Sire!
You're in danger!

100
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,458
[GOAU]
No need for that.

101
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,583
She may be a demon,
but a beautiful one.

102
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,500
Perhaps I've been
totally possessed,

103
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,458
because I'd gladly
let her devour my soul.

104
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,000
[BALGUS]
But, Sire.

105
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,833
[VARIE] We meet at last,
King Goau of Fanelia.

106
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,333
[GOAU] Tell me, how
do you know my name?

107
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,625
[VARIE] When I was born,
a prophecy was made

108
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:23,333
foretelling the coming of the
man for whom I was destined.

109
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,166
He would approach me
on a night like tonight.

110
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,791
When the Mystic
Moon hangs bright

111
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,625
above the western mountains.

112
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,625
"Destined," is it?

113
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:36,625
Yes, Sire. Our meeting
was fated long ago.

114
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,541
Well, if that's the case...

115
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,583
...may I know your name?

116
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,291
It's Varie.

117
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,166
[GOAU]
Varie.

118
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,541
Would you be so kind
as to come with me?

119
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,416
[VARIE]
Yes... beloved.

120
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:01,750
Wow, so those two are Van's
mother and father, huh?

121
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,833
[ADVISOR A]
You can't, Sire!

122
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,541
Marrying a Draconian woman
would be sheer folly!

123
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,958
[ADVISOR B] Need we remind you
it was her accursed people

124
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,916
that brought about the
destruction of Atlantis?

125
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,333
[ADVISOR C]
Surely she'll bring disaster

126
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,000
upon our country as well!

127
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,250
Remember what the legends
tell us, Your Majesty! Beware!

128
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,916
[GOAU]
I don't care what they say.

129
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,125
They have nothing
to do with my Varie!

130
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,500
I've fallen in love with her
and she and I will be married!

131
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,458
Nothing you say
will change my mind.

132
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,708
Varie is going to become
my bride and queen!

133
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,666
[GOAU chuckles]

134
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,416
[GOAU] It's a boy!
A healthy baby boy!

135
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,541
Come, Folken.

136
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:43,083
Say hello to your
new little brother.

137
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,041
[FOLKEN]
What's his name, Father?

138
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,541
[GOAU]
Van. Van Fanel.

139
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:57,166
[VILLAGERS gasping]

140
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,250
[yelps]

141
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,250
[FOLKEN]
Van!

142
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,708
Mother?

143
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,166
Your wings. You can't
let anyone see them.

144
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,708
You must keep
them a secret, Van.

145
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,875
It's important you
understand this.

146
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,000
Never show your wings

147
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,958
until you know that
the time is right.

148
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,375
Please promise me.

149
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,041
I'll be worried
sick if you don't.

150
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,208
I promise, Mother.

151
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,458
I'm so sorry I upset you.

152
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,000
[VARIE crying]

153
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,791
It's Balgus. So you got word?

154
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,500
[BALGUS]
How is he?

155
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:49,666
[BALGUS] I'm too late.
I'm sorry, my king.

156
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,250
[VAN]
Don't worry, Mother.

157
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,583
Even though Folken ran away,

158
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,250
I'll step up and take
his place on the throne.

159
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,416
I'll be a mighty king
like father was!

160
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,958
Just wait, you'll see!

161
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,583
So don't cry.

162
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:06,083
Everything's going to be
all right. Okay, Mother?

163
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,916
[VAN]
Soon afterwards,

164
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,750
mother went into the forest
where the dragons nest

165
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,375
to look for my
brother, Folken.

166
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,625
[VAN] When she didn't come back,
Balgus went to look for her,

167
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,583
but he found no trace.

168
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,000
My mother never
returned to the castle.

169
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:31,083
And I never saw her again.

170
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,250
[HITOMI]
Thank you.

171
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,250
[VAN]
Uh?

172
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,250
[HITOMI]
For telling me about that.

173
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,916
And your wings, too.

174
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If you don't mind me saying,

175
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:44,083
they're very beautiful. Your
wings. I like them a lot.

176
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,333
[chuckles]

177
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,541
[VAN]
You know what?

178
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,791
That's the same thing
Merle told me once.

179
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,125
[HITOMI]
Hey.

180
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,291
Did you just compare me
to that mangy little minx?

181
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,666
Thanks a lot, jerk.

182
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,333
[HITOMI chuckles]

183
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,958
[DORNKIRK]
Hmm...

184
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,083
Why can't I see it?

185
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:22,583
Why can I no longer
see the future?

186
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,458
My visions, which
were once so clear,

187
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:30,916
are now in disarray
and sinking into chaos.

188
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,750
Why won't you show me?

189
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,333
I must see what will transpire!

190
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:39,541
Until I can, the dragon's
shadow will obscure my visions

191
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,750
of what is to come.

192
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,583
[HITOMI]
Um, Van, where're we going?

193
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,208
[VAN]
To the Duchy of Freid.

194
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,291
Gotta to be
somewhere near here.

195
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,416
[HITOMI]
Oh.

196
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:57,708
[HITOMI]
Van, wait!

197
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:59,125
What is it?

198
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,666
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

199
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,208
I don't know why. It's just...

200
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,750
[MERLE]
Just what?

201
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,625
Is something out there?

202
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,750
Is that them?

203
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,291
What's doing that?

204
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,458
It's gotta be them again, Van.

205
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,041
Those invisible
bastards from Zaibach?

206
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,833
I think so.

207
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,875
They're around here somewhere.

208
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,250
[HITOMI]
They're close.

209
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,208
But where are they hiding?

210
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,458
They're straight ahead of us!

211
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:16,875
Dammit!

212
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,916
[VAN]
Hitomi, Merle, hang on tight!

213
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,458
To your right, Van!

214
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,541
Now behind you!

215
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:29,875
[HITOMI, MERLE scream]

216
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,750
How are you missing them?
Are you clods aiming?

217
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,750
They were dead center
in our sights.

218
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,916
[MIGUEL] It's like they
can see us somehow.

219
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,583
No, that's utter nonsense!

220
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,250
Shut up and hit him, would you?

221
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,166
But please try not to kill him.

222
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,875
Where're they now, Hitomi?

223
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,166
There! Dead ahead, Van!

224
00:14:59,208 --> 00:14:59,958
[DILANDAU]
What the--?

225
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:00,500
[VAN]
Hold on!

226
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:01,333
[HITOMI yelps]

227
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,916
Get after them!

228
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:20,500
A river, eh?
Yeah, that's perfect!

229
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,875
Hop down, you two! Hurry!

230
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:22,958
[HITOMI]
What, but why?

231
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,166
[VAN]
Just do it!

232
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,250
[MERLE]
'Kay!

233
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:28,916
[HITOMI]
Hey, wait!

234
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,666
[MERLE]
Please be careful!

235
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,333
Why is he going into the river?

236
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,791
[HITOMI gasps]

237
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,416
[HITOMI]
This way, quick!

238
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,291
They fell for it.

239
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,916
Turning invisible
won't do them any good

240
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,041
if they're in the water.

241
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,666
And now that I can see them.

242
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,333
Clever move.

243
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,500
[yelling]

244
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,833
Do it now! We've got him!

245
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,416
Perfect.

246
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:18,958
[DILANDAU]
Hah!

247
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,125
So much for that
little strategy of yours!

248
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,875
King Van's in trouble!

249
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:29,375
Maybe I should disobey orders
and just crush you right here.

250
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,708
[ZAIBACH SOLDIER A] The
Dragonslayers have captured

251
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:31,708
the target.

252
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,083
Ah, good.

253
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,791
In that case, let's go down
and retrieve the dragon.

254
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,041
Yes, sir.

255
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,791
Oh, no. We have to do
something to help him!

256
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,000
[HITOMI]
Save him!

257
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,208
Somebody, please, save him!

258
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,916
Save Van!

259
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,458
[FOLKEN]
Van, this was inevitable.

260
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:52,416
[ZAIBACH SOLDIER A]
Leviship closing in

261
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,833
from the Norte quadrant!

262

What's that?

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,375
It's Allen!

Allen!

00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,583
And it's a pleasure to
see you again as well, Van.

269
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,500
You're going to pay
for interrupting me.

270
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,375
With your fool life!

You weakling!

Get out of there!

[HITOMI]
Oh, no! Are you okay?

285
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,916
Say something! Allen, please!

286
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,791
This doesn't look good at all.

Please be all right, Commander.

Damn their hides.

291
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:09,333
Fall back. Now.
That's an order.

292
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,375
We've got Freid
ships incoming.

293
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,750
We can't let them see us.

294
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:16,000
If we're spotted, they might
catch wind of our plan.

295
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,291
[DILANDAU] It was just
getting interesting!

296
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:27,833
You cowards.

297
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,250
[HITOMI]
Allen!

298
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,125
Please, answer me!

299
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,625
[GADDES] Hurry, we've
gotta stop the bleeding!

300
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,916
[TRADESHIP CAPTAIN] What
exactly happened to this man?

301
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
[GADDES]
We'll explain later!

302
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,500
Right now, we
need your doctor.

303
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:43,708
Get him up here!

304
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,291
[TRADESHIP CAPTAIN]
Look, I'm very sorry.

305
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,916
But we're just a simple
tradeship that makes daily runs

306
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,041
between Rampant in Asturia
and Godasheem in Freid.

307
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,458
We don't have a doctor,

308
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,541
or anyone who could handle
a serious wound like that.

309
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,250
[HITOMI]
This is my fault.

310
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,916
He got wounded saving me.

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,375
Oh, Allen.

00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,500
[MILLERNA]
Gaddes!

313
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,375
I thought that was
your voice I heard.

Princess Millerna.

I see the rest of you
are here as well, eh?

00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:18,541
Where's Allen?
Shouldn't he be with you?

317
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,833
Allen? What
happened? Oh, no!

318
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,208
That wound.

319
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,125
He's losing blood.
Too much and too quick!

320
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,541
Gaddes, if the bleeding
isn't stopped,

321
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,166
he's not going to make it!

322
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,458
Get the ship's doctor
in here and help him now!

323
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,250
They don't have one,
Your Highness.

324
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,708
[MILLERNA]
You don't?

325
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,583
But... he needs a doctor.

326
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,333
[MOLE MAN]
He has one, Princess.

327
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,708
You.

328
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,291
Unless I'm mistaken, you did
study medicine, correct?

329
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,583
Well, yes, but...

330
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,708
Studying in books doesn't
make you a doctor.

331
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:48,791
I'm not one.

332
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,250
Maybe you aren't,

333
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,250
but you're the closest thing
we have to one, Princess,

334
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,875
that's for sure.

335
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:57,708
You are the only person with
even a chance of saving him.

336
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:06,208
Yes, you're right.
We must be quick.

337
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,541
I need you to go fetch
my blue bag, Mr. Mole.

338
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,750
This one, right?

339
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,333
[KIO] Come on out,
nice and slow!

340
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,083
[REEDEN] If the commander
doesn't pull through,

341
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,083
you're a dead man, you hear?

342
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,583
[MILLERNA] The anesthetic
should've taken effect by now,

343
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:30,166
but I'll need you to hold
him down if he thrashes.

344
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,166
[GADDES]
Yes, ma'am. Of course.

345
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,583
[HITOMI]
Please, God.

346
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,875
I'm begging you. Save Allen.

347
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,500
Let him make it.

348
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,833
He's a good man,

349
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,500
and the only reason
he's hurt is because of me.

350
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,875
Oh, Van.

351
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:10,041
[NARRATOR]
Escaflowne.

352
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:11,291
[ALLEN] Have you ever
believed in someone

353
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:13,000
with your whole heart?

354
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,416
[DILANDAU]
You summoned a Doppelganger?

355
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,375
[VORIS] A rebel, eh?
And who might that be?
