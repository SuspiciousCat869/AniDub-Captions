1
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,916
Allen, I...

2
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,291
Good, you're awake.

3
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:03,708
[gasps]
Is that you, Amano? How?

4
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,291
[AMANO] Whoa, easy,
you need your rest.

5
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:10,416
[HITOMI]
Am I, dreaming?

6
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:15,291
[HITOMI] Or is this real?
Am I back home?

7
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:23,541
[STUDENT C sighs]

8
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:24,750
[STUDENT B]
Man, I'm thirsty.

9
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,583
[STUDENT D] Me too.
Wanna go out for a bit?

10
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,541
[STUDENT A] You gonna
get tea with us, Yukari?

11
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:31,333
Sorry, can't. I've still got
some work to finish up here.

12
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:32,916
I'll go home with Hitomi.

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,583
[STUDENT A] Don't you think
you should leave them alone?

14
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,208
[STUDENT D]
Yeah, give 'em some space!

15
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,791
[STUDENTS giggle]

16
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,833
Or, they can deal with it!

17
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,666
[STUDENT A]
Wow. That is coldblooded.

18
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,916
--[STUDENT B laughs]
--[STUDENT C] Ready?

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,208
[STUDENT D]
Later!

20
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,250
--See you tomorrow, Yukari.
--[STUDENT B] Bye!

21
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,875
Have fun, you guys!

22
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:51,916
[door clatters]

23
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,666
[AMANO] So it was a
planet called "Gaea",

24
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,833
and you could see the Earth
and the moon in the sky?

25
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,750
And this Escaflowne thing.

26
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:16,666
Hmph. I had no idea that
you were such a romantic.

27
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,708
[gasps]

28
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,250
To have such a fantastic dream.

29
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,375
Think so?

30
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,875
[AMANO]
Hm.

31
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:28,041
[gasps]
Hey, that's a cool pendant.

32
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,791
Oh. Thanks. You like it?

33
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:36,791
It's a good luck charm.
I got it from my grandmother.

34
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,333
It's really neat.

35
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,958
When you swing it like this,
it acts like a pendulum clock,

36
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:44,833
completing one cycle a second,
never slowing down.

37
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:48,208
[gasps]
Think I could give it a try?

38
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,875
[gasps]

39
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,333
[HITOMI]
Wait a minute. I think...

40
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,500
...I know what's
about to happen.

41
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,083
[HITOMI] He's going to
test the pendant's swing

42
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,791
against the clock.

43
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,291
That's one...

44
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:12,166
Two. Three. Four.
Five. Six. Sev--

45
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,208
Seven.

46
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,708
[BOTH]
Eight. Nine. Ten.

47
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:22,416
And eleven. And twelve.
And thirteen. Fourteen.

48
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,750
[HITOMI]
Here it comes.

49
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,291
[AMANO]
Kanzaki.

50
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,458
[AMANO]
I wanted to tell you.

51
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,291
[HITOMI]
Then next he says.

52
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,208
You see, I...

53
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,333
[HITOMI gasps]

54
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,583
[door clatters]

55
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:40,291
I brought you--

56
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,333
[gasps]

57
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,333
[YUKARI sighs]

58
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,458
[HITOMI] Yukari! Come on,
say something already!

59
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,666
You can't ignore
me forever, you know.

60
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,625
[YUKARI] I can let this
slide for a rice cake.

61
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,041
[gasps]

62
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:04,625
[YUKARI] And some cheesecake,
and bean-jam pancake,

63
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,833
and some peppermint
ice cream. You know what,

64
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:10,500
let's just say a different
dessert every day for a month.

65
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:11,958
I think that'll do it.

66
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,125
[giggles]

67
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,250
[HITOMI]
It's all the same.

68
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,500
This is exactly what happened
the day before I went to Gaea.

69
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:19,750
[YUKARI]
So, anyway.

70
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,000
Did you hear about that
new place "Shonan Dock"?

71
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,375
Akane was telling me their rice

72
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,750
with hashed meat was
absolutely awesome!

73
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,541
Let's go sometime.

74
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,125
Hey, are you okay?

75
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,458
[HITOMI]
Huh?

76
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,125
You're not looking so good.

77
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:38,625
Uh... Yeah! I feel fine!

78
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,583
[YUKARI]
Don't tell me... you know.

79
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,416
[HITOMI]
Huh?

80
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,333
Eh. Oh, sorry.

81
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:48,916
Forget I said anything.
Come on. Let's go.

82
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:54,416
[HITOMI] Wait a second.
It can't be that Yukari...

83
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,166
[YUKARI]
Hitomi?

84
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,666
[HITOMI]
Yeah?

85
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,000
[YUKARI] Have you ever done
a reading for you and Amano?

86
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,291
[HITOMI]
Never.

87
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,833
[YUKARI]
Why not?

88
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,541
[HITOMI] Well. What if it told
me things wouldn't work out?

89
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,166
[YUKARI]
Oh.

90
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,625
Hey, you seem upset
about something.

91
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,916
[YUKARI]
It's just that.

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,708
[HITOMI]
Huh?

93
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,750
If you really like him...

94
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,833
...Then you should tell him how
you feel before it's too late.

95
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:21,916
Maybe.

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,541
Not "maybe". You have to.

97
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,208
The thing is, I overheard
some other students

98
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,666
talking about Amano before.

99
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,625
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

100
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,333
But I think he's moving
out of the country.

101
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:38,625
His father's job is taking
them to England or something.

102
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,416
You're my best friend in
the whole world, Hitomi.

103
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,250
And that's why...

104
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,375
...If you feel that
strongly about him,

105
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,125
I think you should tell him.

106
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,500
See what he says.
I know you.

107
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,666
You'll regret it if you don't.

108

[HITOMI]
Yukari. You love Amano so much.

109
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,875
[HITOMI]
What do I do?

Hitomi's disappeared?

But how's that even possible?

Really, what the hell's
going on around here?

115
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,833
[MILLERNA] This must be
the work of Zaibach.

116
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,916
[FOLKEN] They aren't
the ones responsible.

118

[FOLKEN] The power of
Dornkirk's science may be vast,

119
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:17,250
But it is incapable of producing
such a pillar of light.

120
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,000
It wasn't him.

121
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,666
Then where could Hitomi be?

122
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,250
She went back home.

After everything
that's happened,

00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,916
she wanted to return
to the Mystic Moon.

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,750
That's where...

127

But, I guess her being gone
is a good thing for us, right?

128
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,250
We don't have to
worry about Zaibach

Father. I wanted to protect her.

I was ready to give
my life over to Hitomi.

But now, I'm not
so certain anymore.

It's strange.

It's not that I don't miss her,
but my heart is calm.

And although she's
left a void here,

151

I'm happy she was finally
able to return to her home.

152
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,458
If I accept her
absence so easily,

153
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,541
I wonder what that
means about my feelings,

154
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,458
and how genuine all the
things I told her really were.

155
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,458
Honestly, I am starting
to believe that I just saw

a lot of our long
lost Celena in Hitomi.

[ALLEN]
Celena!

161
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,708
Of all the cards, why this one?

00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,750
[gasps]

163
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,791
Escaflowne, but...?

164
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,416
Why?

165
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,416
I don't want to go back
to Gaea ever again.

166
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,333
I refuse to.

[MERLE]
King Van?

170
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:16,875
[VAN]
Uh.

171
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,291
What's up, Merle?

172
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,708
Are you okay? You haven't
been acting like yourself.

173
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,875
Is there anything
I can get you?

174
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,875
Thanks, but I'm fine.

175
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,750
You're thinking about her.
Even though she's gone.

176
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,125
[gasps]
That isn't true.

177
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,750
Yes, it is!

178
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,000
[MERLE]
You can't lie to me.

179
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,958
I've been by your side
ever since we were little.

180
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,500
I know you better
than anyone else.

181
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,291
No point denying it.

182
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,125
You can't stop
thinking about Hitomi.

183
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,916
[MERLE]
And I know why.

184
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,958
It's 'cause you love her.

185
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,291
[gasps]

186
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,833
[MERLE] I guess stuff like
that is always more obvious

187
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,458
to those not involved, so it
makes sense you didn't realize.

188
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,333
But I could tell from
the very beginning

189
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,833
how you felt about her.

190
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,458
And I think you need to
remember what she always said.

191
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,791
About the power of our feelings.

192
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,458
I'm sure that yours
can reach her.

193
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,250
If you want them to.

194
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,125
[MERLE]
You just have to try.

195
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,333
[ERIES] And you're
sure that she's Celena?

196
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,541
[ALLEN]
Yes. It's been ten years.

197
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,041
But I know.

198
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,291
I'd recognize her anywhere.

199
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,333
But she doesn't
remember anything.

200
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,958
Not a single detail
from that entire time.

201
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,416
[ERIES]
Amnesia?

202
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,375
Princess Eries?

203
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,250
I must ask you to
watch over my sister.

204
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,166
While I'm away fighting.

205
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,750
Will you do this?

206
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,166
There's no one else I can trust.

207
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,750
Ahh...

208
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:15,916
[CELENA gasps]

209
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,416
[ERIES]
It shall be done.

210
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,625
How could I refuse
a Knight Caeli?

211
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,958
I'll take her to the palace,
and keep her safe by my side.

212
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:32,000
[CELENA screams]

213
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:32,916
What's wrong?

Are you alright, Celena?

Who's that? And what...

Stay back, Princess!

No, wait! Stop!

[FOLKEN]
Dilandau...

231
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,541
I don't know that much.

232
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:37,708
The details of his past are
a complete mystery to me.

233
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,833
However, If I had to speculate,

234
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,791
I would guess the Sorcerers
had a hand in his origin.

235
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,333
What Sorcerers?

236
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:48,000
That's the term they use to
refer to the Zaibach scientists.

237
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,375
They're incredibly powerful
and answer only to Dornkirk.

238
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,916
According to rumor,
they performed experiments

239
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,708
on live subjects to learn
how to manipulate fate.

240
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:01,041
And they acquired those test
subjects by kidnapping children.

241
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,125
Human experiments?!

242

They did that... To Celena?

244
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,041
[TEACHER] I'm sure
you've all heard the story

245
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:16,375
of how Isaac Newton discovered
universal gravitations

246
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,291
by witnessing an apple
fall from a tree?

247
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,958
What you probably don't know,

248
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,791
is that Newton
also had interests

249
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,833
in alchemy and other
magical subjects as well.

250
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,875
Quite a surprise.

Lord Dornkirk, sir,

preparations have
been completed.

By channeling the
gravity between

256
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:50,916
the girl and the dragon,

257
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,791
We believe it will be
possible to generate

258
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,250
elemental fate particles.

259
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,541
[DORNKIRK]
Yes. Gravity is indeed crucial.

260
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,208
It is that ever-constant
force that shall summon

261
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,708
the girl to Gaea once again.

realize it until now.

You're my best friend!

Sorry. I don't have much time.

272
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,958
I have to see him again.
And that means I have to leave.

So, for now. Goodbye.
