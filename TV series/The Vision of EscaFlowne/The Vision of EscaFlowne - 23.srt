1
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,708
[KING'S AIDES chattering]

2
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:51,208
[KING'S AIDE A]
Is this a joke?

3
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:54,375
The Strategos of Zaibach is
truly asking us for asylum?!

4
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:55,625
[KING'S AIDE 7B]
You left the empire

5
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:58,083
because you disagreed
with Dornkirk's methods?

6
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,291
[KING'S AIDE 7A] And you allege
that he and his followers are

7
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:03,291
leading Gaea toward the greatest
disaster in her history?

8
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,833
[KING'S AIDE 22A] This is why
you're requesting sanctuary?

9
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:07,375
[KING'S AIDE 7B]
You can't honestly expect us

10
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:08,791
to trust your word!

11
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:12,958
I happen to agree. This is
all suspiciously sudden.

12
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:16,041
[FOLKEN] If it helps,
I've come bearing gifts.

13
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,666
[HITOMI]
Folken's arrival in Asturia

14
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,916
and request for safe haven
changed everything.

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,708
It proved everyone's
suspicions about Zaibach,

16
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,208
and Asturia quickly
formed a military alliance

17
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,166
with her neighboring countries.

18
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,375
[HITOMI] They finally agreed
to grant Folken asylum

19
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:02,416
as he requested, in exchange
for information on Zaibach.

20
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,500
[HITOMI]
But Van still didn't trust him.

21
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:35,625
[MEN chattering]

22
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,250
[CHILDREN laughing]

23
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:55,375
Wouldn't you rather help out at
the castle's shelter instead?

24
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:58,833
Not really. I'm partly to
blame for what happened here.

25
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,916
I want to help as many
people as I can.

26
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,500
[MERLE] Yeah? Then why didn't
you come all by yourself?

27
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,208
Hey, nobody forced you
to tag along, did they?

28
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,250
You wanna step outside?

29
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,291
Eh?

30
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,666
[ALL]
Uh?

31
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,583
[PRIEST A] We're honored
that you traveled so far

32
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,875
out of the way to grace us
with your presence, Princess.

33
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,791
Not at all. So many
have met hardship here.

34
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:23,250
I want to do whatever I can
to ease their burdens.

35
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,208
[GADDES] Don't push!
There's plenty for everybody!

36
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,208
[MERLE laughs]

37
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,291
I'm gonna go help out!

38
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,416
So am I!

39
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,250
Thanks a lot!

40
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,041
[GIRL B]
Me next, me next!

41
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,083
We still have to
keep our guard up.

42
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,916
While we're doing this, Zaibach
could be launching an attack.

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,916
My goodness, you really
do always have battle

44
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,208
on the brain, don't you?

45
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,833
If you're not ready to fight,

46
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,041
then you are just
waiting to be killed.

47
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:53,208
[DRYDEN] Hmph.
You soldiers are all alike.

48
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,041
Not everything's about death
and destruction, you know.

49
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,791
Zaibach is going
to destroy Gaea.

50
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,708
The same way they
did my country.

51
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:06,750
[sighs] All right. Just be
patient, O' King of Fanelia.

52
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,416
We'll see what happens.

53
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,333
Do you have any toys? We
want some toys to play with!

54
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,583
Toys and candy?

55
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,000
I'll go take a look.

56
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,250
Mm...

57
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,500
You're gonna have to
let me by, though.

58
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,708
[screams]

59
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:26,208
Hey, kid! Don't you
pull my tail! [screams]

60
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,458
Come back here!

61
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,250
Look at Merle play with them.

62
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,625
[gasps]

63
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,750
She seems to fit right in.

64
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,208
[VAN] She knows what
they're going through.

65
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,791
[HITOMI]
Huh?

66
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:39,166
All of those children have lost
their homes and their families.

67
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,375
And so did Merle.

68
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,125
That's something war always
seems to leave in its wake--

69
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,916
Orphaned kids.

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,083
Hey, Van,

71
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,916
back when you and
Folken were growing up,

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,916
what did you do for fun?

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,916
None of your business.

74
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,333
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,458
[ALLEN] Hitomi! What
are you doing here?

76
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,500
I've been searching all
over the grounds for you!

77
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:01,833
I'm helping. I noticed
everybody else is...

78
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,375
Couldn't just sit on the
side and do nothing.

79
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,125
You shouldn't have
left the castle!

80
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,500
Don't you realize that your
being here jeopardizes

81
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,041
your safety and therefore
the safety of Gaea?

82
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,208
You're always leaving
without asking.

83
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,583
Like when you flew off
to Fanelia with Van.

84
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,125
But that was...

85
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,500
Actually, I don't
think that trip's

86
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,708
any of your business, Allen.

87
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,291
I just don't like it when
you hide things from me.

88
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,708
Well, I'm not.

89
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,750
And I'm offended you
would even think it!

90
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,500
[ALLEN]
Hitomi!

91
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:34,041
[HITOMI] I'll go back to the
castle later... by myself.

92
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,500
[ALLEN]
Hitomi...

93
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,500
[HITOMI] What's the
matter with me today?

94
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,291
I don't think I've ever
snapped at Allen like that.

95
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,791
I just felt so mad
all of a sudden.

96
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:23,333
[panting]

97
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,916
[FOLKEN] You must be
missing your homeland.

98
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,750
Oh, Folken!

99
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,458
[FOLKEN]
So that's why you were there.

100
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,666
[HITOMI]
I thought I could help somehow.

101
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,875
I know Van would feel better

102
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,916
if things were straightened
out between you.

103
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,333
Van is a very stubborn boy.

104
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:56,166
Yeah, no matter what I say,
I can't get through to him.

105
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,083
[FOLKEN] What about you?
Do you not fear me?

106
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,625
[gasps]

107
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,875
I'm the one who brought the
Intensified Luck Soldiers here.

108
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,458
And I did it for the
purpose of kidnapping you.

109
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:09,125
[HITOMI] Well, I can't say
I'm okay with that, but...

110
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,083
But what?

111
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,708
[HITOMI]
If I were scared of you,

112
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,833
then we'd both be on our guard.

113
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,750
And that's not what I want.

114
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,291
If you want someone
to trust you,

115
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,250
you have to be willing
to trust them.

116
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,333
Should you be so eager
to trust me, though?

117
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,875
For all you know, my coming here
could be part of a Zaibach plot.

118
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,500
That's possible.

119
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,291
But I still don't think
you'd try to hurt me.

120
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,750
I believe you're
an honorable man.

121
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,416
Even if that's not always
obvious to people.

122
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:40,333
[FOLKEN] So that's your power.
You see the good in people.

123
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,791
The Egzardia army's
Triville has arrived!

124
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,041
[ROYAL GUARD B]
And the forces from Palas?

125
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,708
We expect them at the hour
of ripla tomorrow morning.

126
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,333
[ROYAL GUARD B]
The armies of Daedalus, Cesario,

127
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,500
and even Basram are involved.

128
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,291
Looks like this will
be the first Great War

129
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,041
in Gaea's history.

130
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,708
[HITOMI]
What's going on?

131
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,750
[ALLEN] Dispatch orders
have been issued.

132
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:31,833
[HITOMI]
Uh...

133
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,375
[ALLEN]
Van and I will leave together.

134
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,708
We go at the break of dawn.

135
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:39,916
But first, there's something
important that I must tell you.

136
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,125
[HITOMI]
Uh...

137
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,291
[ALLEN] I'm sure you
remember Prince Chid.

138
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:47,416
The truth is that he is my son;
Princess Marlene is his mother.

139
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,791
We never told anyone,
but we were in love.

140
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:54,875
It was secret tryst, and
then she married the duke.

141
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,916
Why tell me now?

142
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,708
Because I realized something--

143
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,291
That I never wanna hide
anything from you.

144
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,833
I love you too much to do that.

145
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,791
[ALLEN]
Now that I've told you this...

146
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,625
Now that you know everything...

147
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,333
Can you possibly love me?

148
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,458
Under the same stars,
the same moonlight.

149
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,208
I want us to be
together forever.

150
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,750
[DILANDAU]
What is this? Where am I?

151
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,791
You are currently aboard the
floating fortress, Delate.

152
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:33,250
[DILANDAU] What do you mean,
Delate? Where's Shesta?

153
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,875
Shesta is dead.

154
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,833
Get Gatty, then. Where's he?

155
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,000
He died, as well.

156
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,458
[DILANDAU]
And Dallet?

157
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:44,458
[JAJUKA]
Dead.

158
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,708
[DILANDAU]
Viole?

159
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,000
[JAJUKA]
Also dead.

160
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,375
They're all dead?

161
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,791
[whimpers] No!

162
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,875
I didn't catch your name yet.

163
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,000
My name is Jajuka, sir.

164
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,666
Doesn't sound familiar.

165
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,458
[JAJUKA] I am a soldier
under your command.

166
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,750
I, alone.

167
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,333
No one else...

168
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:24,875
[screams]

169
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,458
[whimpers]

170
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:33,958
[pants]

171
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,458
Jajuka...

172
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,916
Can you tell me whether or not

173
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,916
my new Guymelef
is finally ready?

174
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,083
Yes, sir!

175
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,916
[DILANDAU chuckles]

176
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,250
It's been a long time since
I've had a good battle.

177
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm so looking forward to it.

178
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,708
[ALLEN]
Van, I've been looking for you.

179
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:04,750
[VAN]
Allen?

180
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,833
A word about Hitomi.

181
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,041
All right. And what about her?

182
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:14,666
So you know, I proposed
marriage to her last night.

183
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,166
She'll give her answer
when I return.

184
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:24,250
I can't explain it, but I'm only
at ease when I'm with her.

185
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,250
You had better keep her
safe. I mean it, Allen.

186
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,458
I will never allow anything
to happen to her.

187
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,583
Even if it costs me my life.

188
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,000
[HITOMI] Prince Chid is
actually Allen's son.

189
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,500
[CHID]
Hitomi!

190
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,541
[HITOMI]
Am I stuck here?

191
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:49,708
Will I ever be able to
go back home to Earth?

192
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,291
[MILLERNA]
Hitomi?

193
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,833
What do you think
of my outfit?

194
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,958
[ATTENDANT A] Princess! You
really shouldn't be doing that!

195
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,541
Don't worry. I doubt that
Dryden would have a problem

196
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,583
with me doing a little
laundry. Right, Hitomi?

197
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,875
Uh. Eh, yeah, sure.

198
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,541
[HITOMI]
Um, hey, Millerna?

199
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,125
[MILLERNA]
Yes?

200
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,791
[HITOMI] I could use a
little advice on something.

201
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,250
Maybe you can
help me out?

202
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:18,458
Me? Now what could I possibly
give you advice about?

203
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,833
Well, uh. I have this friend

204
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:23,208
and I'm sort of worried
about her, you see.

205
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,458
Yes?

206
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,958
[HITOMI] There's this
guy she's kind of with,

207
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,541
and she really likes him.

208
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,958
But she's found out
he's sort of a playboy.

209
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,000
Uh-huh.

210
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,875
And he even has an
illegitimate child, too;

211
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,583
so she isn't sure what to...

212
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,583
[MILLERNA] But she found out
that he's really a playboy

213
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:44,458
and... even fathered a child
that no one knows about.

214
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,708
[BOTH gasp]

215
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,833
So that was who you meant?

216
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,083
[MILLERNA]
How did you find out?

217
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,166
You knew this whole time.

218
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,916
[MILLERNA] Yes, I knew,
and now so do you.

219
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The truth is, you never know
what life has in store for you,

220
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,125
and sooner or later,
we all make mistakes.

221
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,291
But we can't go back in
time and change them.

222
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:10,000
[HITOMI] Millerna is
still in love with Allen.

223
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,750
[GADDES] Right, there it is.
That's Rampant.

224
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,666
Kio! Be sure to set her
down real easy like.

225
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,250
We're representing Asturia;

226
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,875
they need to know
we're the good guys.

227
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,041
[ALLEN gasps]

228
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,916
[ROYAL GUARD C]
What is that?!

229
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,708
Zaibach's attacking!

230
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,416
Send Garrison units!
And the Melefs aswell!

231
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,541
[ROYAL GUARDS]
Sir!

232
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,750
Did you miss me?!

233
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,250
[laughing]

234
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,708
[REEDEN]
It's on fire!

235
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,625
The harbor's going up in smoke!

236
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,583
They launched a
surprise attack!

237
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:17,666
[ALLEN] Gaddes! Just lower us in
there! And I'll take Scherazade.

238
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,333
[GADDES] Commander! You heard
the man, drop Scherazade now!

239
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,000
Take us down! Kio!
Go, full power!

240
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,125
Yes, sir!

241
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:32,000
[VAN] Allen! I'll go in first
and split their forces.

242
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:32,875
Van!

243
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,083
[VAN growls]

244
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:47,708
[HITOMI] Now that I know,
what should I believe?

245
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,625
Who do I trust?

246
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,666
It's a sea of flames
down there. Damn it!

247
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,291
[ROYAL GUARD A] Right flank!
Cover our right flank!

00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,708

[ZAIBACH SOLDIER A screams]

[gasps] Oh, no. What was that?

255
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,041
[ROYAL GUARD 23A]
Squad three!

256
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:27,208
We need you up front!
Get in there!

258

I'll protect Hitomi.

[DILANDAU laughs]
Well, fancy meeting you here.

262
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,291
It's the red
Guymelef again!

263
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:49,625
I've missed our old
war games; let's play!

264
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,916
Now. Burn away!

265
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,875
[VAN yelling]

266
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,875
So sorry, Van;
did I singe you?

267
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:28,291
Dear Allen Schezar.
Oh, how I hate you!

268
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,166
Van! I need you
to watch my back!

269
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,750
No. Wait, Allen!

270
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,333
That's the Ispano Guymelef
everyone's been talking about.

271
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,708
If we defeat it, we'll
be heroes for sure!

272
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:42,916
Come on!

273
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,000
No, Van! Stop!

274
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:45,916
[VAN]
I'll protect her.

275

You haven't lost your touch,
Allen. I'm very impressed.

[ALLEN yells]

Lord Dilandau!

282
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,000
Stay out of this, Jajuka!

283
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,000
You must listen to me!

284

[VAN growls]

That's enough.
I can't take it.

Van. Stop. I'm begging you.

Oh, thank you, Van!
This is so much fun!

300
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:03,000
What's with him? Why's
he always out for blood?

301
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,583
The anticipation's killing me!

302
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:07,791
Damn you!

00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,250
Now die!

What?!

00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,500
I'll never die by your hand!

307
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:18,500
I'll protect her!

308
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,250
Just shut up!

00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,416
They completely
outmaneuvered us again.

320
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
We must return to Palas.

321
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,166
[HITOMI]
Why?

322
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,291
Why is everyone
always fighting?

323
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,750
I hate this.

324
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,916
I don't want to see it anymore.

325
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,500
[DRYDEN] So, then. Rampant
was completely destroyed.

326
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:39,958
[ALLEN]
Yes.

327
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,166
We need to hold a meeting
here with all of our allies.

328
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,541
[DRYDEN]
You're right.

329
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,708
Zaibach will hit even
harder next time.

330
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,416
We have to start preparing
for it immediately.

331
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Yes.

332
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,250
We could launch a
preemptive strike.

333
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,166
It's going to come
down to us, or them.

334
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,750
[HITOMI] Why is fighting the
only thing you ever think about?

335
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,625
How can you even ask?
You know why.

336
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,333
We're fighting to protect you
and everybody else here.

337
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,083
I saw your face!

338
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,000
You were enjoying the
battle and the bloodshed!

339
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,333
[ALL gasp]

340
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,000
If that's what war
turns you into,

341
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,875
I don't want you to protect me!

342
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,416
I'm sick of all this fighting.

343
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,375
I'm sick of this
whole stupid place!

344
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,500
Hitomi, wait!

345
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,750
[HITOMI] Just send
me back, already!

346
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,916
Please, all I want to do
is go home to Earth!

347
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,708
[BOTH]
Hitomi!

348
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,875
[NARRATOR]
Escaflowne.

349
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,208
[DILANDAU]
"Celena"?

350
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:15,041
[MERLE] And I know why.
It's 'cause you love her.

351
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,333
He's calling.
