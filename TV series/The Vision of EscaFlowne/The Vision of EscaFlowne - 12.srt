1
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,416
[FREID] I've heard what
happened, Fanelia.

2
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,666
Regarding the tragedy
that befell your country.

3
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,041
As a fellow leader of men,

4
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,500
you have my utmost sympathy.

5
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:11,583
I thank you, Duke Freid.
That's very kind of you.

6
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,083
[FREID]
I have also been informed

7
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:17,041
of Zaibach's activities.
Hence our current meeting.

8
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,791
I thought it best
I returned here,

9
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,125
to our capital of Godashim.

10
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:28,583
Unfortunately... Allen!

11
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:29,916
No matter the reason,

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,250
a knight brings nothing
but shame to himself

13
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,083
by abandoning his country.

14
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:37,333
To disobey the word of one's
lord is absolute treason.

15
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:40,416
We have no use for
such an immoral ruffian

16
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,458
in the Duchy of Freid.

17
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,250
[CHID]
Please, wait!

18
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,666
Consider everything Allen

19
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,958
and his companions have
done for our country!

20
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,541
Father. They risked
their lives for us.

21
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,708
They defended Freid and
found the Doppelganger!

22
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,166
[FREID]
That's enough!

23
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,708
You're too inexperienced to
speak with such authority!

24
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:00,375
Have you considered what
those actions cost?

25
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,625
Your decisions may have
assured our demise!

26
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:04,833
[CHID sighs]

27
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:05,791
[MILLERNA]
Excuse me!

28
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:06,333
[CHID]
Uh!

29
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,750
[FREID]
Hm?

30
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,750
Come in, Princess Millerna.

31
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,583
Well. Here we go...

32
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,625
Princess.

33
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,208
It is good to see you, but
we'll have to talk later.

34
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,500
I hope you will forgive me

35
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,416
because this cannot
wait, Brother.

36
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
Sorry. After everything
that's happened,

37
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,541
I suppose don't have the right
to call you that anymore.

38
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,583
I, too, have abandoned Asturia.

39
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:37,625
[gasps]

40
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,000
[MILLERNA]
Your Grace.

41
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,500
Zaibach's actions
are sheer madness.

42
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,708
Their intention is to
plunge all of Gaea

43
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,708
into the bloody chaos of war.

44
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:53,625
Fanelia is only the beginning
of their destructive conquest.

45
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,208
And what's more.

46
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:59,291
They're on their way here now to
make Freid their next target!

47
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,458
And unfortunately, my father.

48
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:05,625
No, "King Aston" won't do
anything to stop them.

49
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:10,041
He honestly believes it is
in Asturia's best interest.

50
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,625
But once the rest of Gaea has
fallen under Zaibach's control,

51
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:17,250
there's no way Austuria
will be left in peace.

52
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,041
[MILLERNA] To prevent
this from happening,

53
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:26,000
Allen Schezar came here on
his own to warn and aid you!

54
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,125
So. Please, your Grace.

55
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:31,000
Find it in your heart
to forgive Allen!

56
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,000
[FREID]
Princess Millerna.

57
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,500
[gasps]

58
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,875
You are both wise
and benevolent.

59
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,833
Those are signs of
a good upbringing.

60
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:44,000
Asturia has produced
a fine princess.

61
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,875
[FREID]
Hear me!

62
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:53,375
Allen will you join my soldiers
and fight against Zaibach?

63
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,708
It would be my honor

64
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,458
to offer my life in service
to you, Your Grace.

65
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,458
We shall be glad to
have your sword.

66
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,166
I expect your very best!

67
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,541
[ALLEN]
Sir!

68
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:19,875
[HITOMI] I can't believe
this man is Chid's father.

69
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,291
[DORNKIRK]
Did you say...

70
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,916
"a girl from the Mystic Moon"?

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,958
[FOLKEN]
Yes. It's an oddity.

72
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,291
She's proven she can see
through our stealth cloaks,

73
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,625
revealing our
Guymelefs' locations.

74
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,083
Also. According to the
reports I've received.

75
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,666
She's been guiding the dragon

76
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,333
based on predictions
of the future.

77
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:44,333
[DORNKIRK]
Yes. That is excellent news.

78
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,333
M'Lord?

79
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,166
[DORNKIRK]
This must be the anomaly

80
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,333
that has so confounded my
Destiny Prognostication Engine.

81
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,500
I wish to see it!

82
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,500
[FOLKEN]
Yes, Lord.

83
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,625
It's been so very long.

84
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:06,416
Since the last time I set
eyes on the planet Earth.

85
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,458
But still...

86
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,666
I remember.

87
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,125
[MOLE MAN]
Mm-hm.

88
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,333
[MILLERNA]
That's a relief.

89
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,875
Your wound seems to
be healing up nicely.

90
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,791
[MILLERNA]
Allen. I want you to know.

91
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,583
I don't care about
Asturia or Freid.

92
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:13,833
So long as you're safe,
I'll be happy.

93
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:14,958
[MOLE MAN]
Mm?

94
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:15,666
[MERLE meows]

95
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,541
[yelps]

96
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,041
So what'cha doin'?

97
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,208
Nothing! I wasn't
eavesdropping!

98
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,666
--[MERLE] Hey, Allen!
--[MOLE MAN shouting]

99
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,625
Have you seen Hitomi
around here?

100
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,083
[ALLEN]
No. Not recently, at least.

101
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:30,333
[MERLE] Oh. Well,
sorry I bothered you.

102
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,500
[gasps]

103

[ZONGI screaming]

104
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,458
I can't take it anymore.

105
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,208
These awful visions.

106
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,041
Why won't they stop coming?

107
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,208
[MERLE meows]

108
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,541
You know, I'll say
one thing about you.

109
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,416
You're entertaining.

110
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,125
[HITOMI]
I appreciate you mocking me

111
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,166
when you have no idea
what I'm going through.

112

"Ohhhhh! I can't
take it anymore!

113
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,708
Why? Why won't they
stop? Why, oh, why?"

114
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,208
[exhales]

115
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,625
Fine!

116
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,375
If you're gonna be no fun,
King Van wants to see you!

117
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,958
[REEDEN] Man, would you look
at the nicks on this thing?

118
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:27,291
You're way too rough on
this sword, Your Majesty!

119
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,250
[VAN]
I am?

120
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,375
Yeah, you are.

121
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,000
Meanwhile, Commander
Allen's sword

122
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,458
ain't got a single
scratch on it!

123
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,875
Well, excuse me!

124
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,500
I'm not as good as Allen,
just go on and say it.

125
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,458
[REEDEN]
C'mon. No need for a hissy fit.

[VAN grunts]

127
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,458
Besides, he's just
yankin' your chain.

128
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:42,958
Don't let the little
twerp get to you.

129
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,458
It's got scratches.
Just not as many.

130
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,666
[REEDEN chuckles]

131

[MERLE]

00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,458
[MERLE laughs]

133
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,708
There you are!

134
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:53,833
[MERLE grunts]

135
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,541
Do you need something?

136
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,625
I could really use your
help, if you don't mind.

137
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,125
[HITOMI]
Uh.

138
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,708
Oh. Don't worry, I don't want
you to fight or anything.

139
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,125
It has to do with your
ability to see the future

140
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,208
and gauge where
invisible targets are.

141
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,375
I was hoping you could
use that power to tell us

142
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,208
which direction Zaibach is
planning to attack from.

143
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,333
Whoa, that's actually
a really good idea!

144
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,166
Yeah, and if it works,
we can stop 'em all

145
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,458
dead in their tracks!

146
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,958
That kinda knowledge,

147
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,000
that little lady will be our
very own Goddess of Victory!

Uh...

00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,500
[HITOMI]
I won't.

153
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,208
What's wrong?

154
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,375
[HITOMI]
Everything.

155
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,708
I hate having those visions.

[VAN]
Uh.

157
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,291
And now you want to use me
like I'm just some tool.

00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,750
[VAN gasps]

159
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,125
[HITOMI] Back on Earth,
I was nothing special.

160
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,333
Just a normal girl.

I mean, yeah, I did readings,

162
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,375
and they were more accurate
than other people's.

163
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,583
But, it's different now.

164
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:50,916
Since I came to Gaea,

165
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,541
my readings are so
accurate it's terrifying.

166
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,958
And the things I see
are awful! So I won't!

I can't stand to have
another vision like that,

[STUDENT A]

Can you do a reading about
my boyfriend and me?

[STUDENT B] Aw, I wanted
her to do my reading first!

177
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,250
[STUDENT A] I need to
know if it's too soon

to say 'I love you.'

[STUDENT C] Your predictions

[STUDENT B]
I'm counting on you, Hitomi!

181
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,250
I was a fortune-teller.
It was just a game.

182
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,541
Just for fun. But not now.

183
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,625
Now I want it to go away.

184
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,458
Make it stop.

00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,375
Duke Freid! Good evening.

[FREID]
Hello, Princess.

187
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,750
[MILLERNA]
What is this place?

188
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,000
[FREID]
This is a villa

189
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,250
that Marlene used when
she lived in Asturia.

190
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,875
When she became my wife,
I had it recreated here

191
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,166
so she would feel more
at home in Freid.

192
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,500
Oh, wow!

193
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,750
I guess that explains why
it looks so familiar.

194
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,458
[FREID]
Yes. An exact copy.

195
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,750
You are welcome to use these
rooms while you're here.

196
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,833
I'm certain it's what Marlene
would have wanted.

197
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,666
Uh?

198
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,208
Yes, of course!
I remember this.

199
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,875
[MILLERNA]
You're leaving me, aren't you?

200
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,500
I want you to stay!

201
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,500
It will be all right.

202
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,458
Come, Princess Marlene.
It's time to go.

203
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,375
I'm going to miss you, sis!

[CHID] Hitomi? What's
wrong, can't you sleep?

210
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,875
No, I guess not.

211
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,583
I feel like if I went
to sleep now,

212
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,750
I'd never wake up, and
that'd be the end of me.

213
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,125
I understand.

214
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,666
[HITOMI]
Uh?

215
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,166
No matter how hard I try, I
can't stop thinking about war.

216
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,041
And my body won't stop shaking.

217
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,750
[CHID]
My father's right.

218
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:51,708
He tells me all the time I don't
have what it takes to be a duke.

219
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,708
Stop relying on me!

220
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,083
[CHID]
No matter what I do,

221
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,541
I'll never be strong
like my father.

222
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,250
My mother always wanted
me to be a good ruler.

223
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,791
That's why she told me so
many stories about Allen.

224
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:15,583
But it's hopeless,
really. I know it is.

225
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:19,583
I'll never be able to live up to
my parents' expectations of me.

226
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,625
That can't be true.

227
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:25,708
[HITOMI]
You know something?

228
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,250
People have an amazing ability.

229
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,833
[CHID]
Uh?

230
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:33,250
It's something my grandmother
told me about a long time ago.

231
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,875
You should always
say to yourself,

232
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,083
"I wish I were,"
or, "I want to be."

233
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,541
Do that, and before you know it,

234
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,166
those wishes will
have come true.

235
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,416
Do you really think so?

236
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,166
Of course I do.

237
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,791
When you set your mind
on something like that,

238
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,333
you give it your all
and never quit

239
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,458
until you finally
achieve your goal.

240
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,750
But at the same time,
if you only tell yourself,

241
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,291
"It's hopeless, I can't do it.

242
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,041
My dreams will
never come true,"

243
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,833
well, then they never will.

244
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,416
It works both ways, you see.

245
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:04,958
[HITOMI]
If you want it bad enough,

246
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,250
your wish will eventually
reach the stars,

247
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,583
and they'll give you the last of
their power to make it happen.

248
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,208
The power of the stars.

249
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:19,416
Heh.

250
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,666
Hey!

How would you like it if
I did a reading for you?

252
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,125
It's like talking to the stars.

253
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,208
My tarot cards can
use the stars' power

254
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:29,250
to reveal all sorts of
things about the future.

255

tell you your fortune!

[MARLENE] The blonde youth

269
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,750
has been named to
the Knights Caeli.

270
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,458
Given his age, and considering
only a dozen knights

271
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:18,750
may hold that title at a time in
Asturia, it is quite the honor.

They dubbed him the
"Knight of the Heavens".

If you ask me, it's a
perfect description.

00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:34,125
[GENERAL A] Yes, General.
As for your orders, sir.

320
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:37,291
When would you like for us
to initiate the operation?

321
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,000
Now.

322
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,375
[SOLDIER A]
All ships are in formation!

323
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,583
[ADELPHOS]
Very good.

324
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,000
The time has come!

325
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,125
[ADELPHOS] The grace
of the gods is with us!

326
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,416
Ready? Move out!

327
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,083
Army of Bronze, mobilize now!

328
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:03,125
Beginning operation!
Army of Iron!

329
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,625
Army of Silver,
deploying forces!

330
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,625
Just how many Guymelefs
are they fielding?

331
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:49,750
[VORIS] Majesty. The enemy
has flanked us on all sides.

332
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,166
There's roughly 55,000 troops.

333
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,458
And they have 10,000
Guymelefs as well.

334
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,125
This is more than a mere siege.

335
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,708
Voris. Do you accept
the responsibility

336
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:06,250
that comes with being born a
citizen of the Duchy of Freid?

337
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,125
I will admit, it's a fine
day for what's written

338
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,833
in the Book of Lions.

339
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,416
Book of Lions?
What does that mean?

340
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,125
[SOLDIER A]
To the gates! Hurry!

341
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,333
King Van, what are you doing?!

342
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:22,916
What I can! Take care
of Hitomi for me!

343
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,708
Please be safe.

344
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:45,458
Please, King Van.
Come back to us alive.

345
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,416
[ALLEN] Gaddes, take up position
above the castle in the Crusade.

346
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,083
I'll head out in Scherazade.

347
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,458
[GADDES]
Yes, sir!

348
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,125
[MILLERNA]
Allen!

349
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,875
[ALLEN]
Yes, Princess?

350
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,666
[MILLERNA]
I'm sorry.

351
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,166
But there's something
I need to ask.

352
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,791
Is it something to do
with Princess Marlene?

353
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,250
[gasps]

354
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:17,208
[ALLEN] It's true. Marlene
and I were in love long ago.

355
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:21,833
It was before she was
betrothed to Duke Freid.

356
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,333
And...

357
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,750
Due to our time together,
it's likely that Prince Chid--

358
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,958
No! I don't want to hear it!

359
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:31,250
[FREID] Chid is my son,
do you understand?!

360
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,000
[MILLERNA]
Duke Freid.

361
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,250
[ZAIBACH SOLDIER A]
Dragonslayers are in position!

362
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,833
[FOLKEN] Hold steady
for the time being.

363
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:46,083
I expect you to follow the
plan to the letter, Dilandau.

364
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:49,416
[DILANDAU] Of course,
Strategos. Don't I always?

365
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,000
[FOLKEN]
Van.

366
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:10,416
[NARRATOR] Escaflowne.

367
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:20,000
[CHID] They gave their lives
so that we could escape.
