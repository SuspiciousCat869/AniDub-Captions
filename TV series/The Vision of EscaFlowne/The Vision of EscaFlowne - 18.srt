1
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:51,250
You must always remember, Van.

2
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:55,916
What will ultimately determine
Gaea's future... is your will.

3
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,625
But, Mother, how?

4
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:00,500
[VARIE]
Remember that... Van.

5
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,708
An Energist.

6
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,916
The Energist is lighting up.

7
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,291
What's going on here?

8
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,125
It's coming from Escaflowne.

9
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,958
[MERLE]
King Van!

10
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,000
[gasps]

11
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,416
[ALLEN]
Hitomi!

12
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,750
Hitomi!

13
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,041
[MILLERNA]
No, wait!

14
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,541
Don't leave me.

15
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,958
What? They just disappeared...

16
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:52,958
This is bad.

17
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,500
How could this happen?

18
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,833
Where could King Van have gone?

19
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,916
[SORCERER A] The Power Spot
energy influx is at 72.

20
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,916
[SORCERER B] Causality Detector
sensitivity set to nominal.

21
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,083
[SORCERER C]
Power is stable.

22
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:36,125
All functions are
operating properly.

23
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:39,625
[SORCERER D] Fate Oscillator
has reached the critical level.

24
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,041
[MALE SORCERER E] Power Spot

25
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,500
Fluctuation rhythm,
point zero three.

26
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,291
Everything's primed.

27
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,750
[DORNKIRK]
Finally.

28
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:51,708
After all this time, the
preparations are now complete.

29
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:56,250
I've been imagining this
moment for a very long while.

30
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,291
Begin Alteration!

31
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,833
[SORCERER A]
Alteration has begun!

32
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,125
Alteration has begun!

33
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,541
[SORCERER C]
Alteration has begun!

34
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,708
[SORCERER D]
Alteration has begun!

35
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,791
[DORNKIRK laughing]

36
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:27,541
[DORNKIRK] That's right!
Show me what I wish to see most!

37
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:31,750
I must see my dream!
My ideals come to life!

38
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:40,416
[DORNKIRK] Huh? What's wrong?
It doesn't seem to be working.

39
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,125
Hmm. What's this?

40
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,666
What happened?

41
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,250
[HITOMI]
Whoa, Allen.

42
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,958
Van. Where are we?

43
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:58,916
[HITOMI]
Escaflowne.

44
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,291
It must've been
transported here as well.

45
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,875
Why's it glowing?

46
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,625
[HITOMI]
Van!

47
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,750
What's going on here?

48
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,208
[HITOMI]
I'm not sure.

49
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,166
It almost looks like we're
in some kind of planetarium.

50
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,666
[ALLEN] Whatever this place is,
it's definitely strange.

51
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,791
Whoa, the floor is moving.

52
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,291
[DORNKIRK]
Welcome to my humble abode.

53
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:30,500
You who are bound together
by the fate of the dragon.

54
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,166
[VAN]
Who's there? Show yourself!

55
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,791
[HITOMI]
Oh, wow.

56
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,041
Are you the person
who brought us here?

57
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:50,375
[DORNKIRK] Indeed. You have
answered the call of fate.

58
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,625
[VAN]
Fate?

59
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:52,875
[DORNKIRK]
Yes.

60
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,666
You see, I am the leader
of the Zaibach Empire.

61
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,208
The one who will guide Gaea
to her glorious future.

62
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:02,333
I am Emperor Dornkirk.

63
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,625
But that's impossible.

64
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,125
That means we're in
the heart of Zaibach.

65
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,208
What, there's no way.

66
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,958
If what he's telling
us is the truth,

67
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,458
that's the man behind it all.

68
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,416
He's the monster that
my brother serves.

69
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,916
[HITOMI]
Wait!

70
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,500
I'll end you now and save
Gaea from any more suffering!

71
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,125
[DORNKIRK]
It won't help.

72
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,708
[VAN]
What?

73
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:27,583
[DORNKIRK] Conflict can erupt
at any time, from any source.

74
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,958
War is the destiny
from which humanity

75
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,375
has never been able to escape.

76
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,916
What could someone like you
possibly know about destiny?

77
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,291
[DORNKIRK]
As it happens,

78
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,250
I possess the power
to predict fate.

79
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:44,833
Just as the ancient people of
Atlantis were once able to do.

80
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,541
Wait, Atlantis?

81
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,208
Could it be possible?
Are you Isaac?

82
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:53,708
Hmm. Haven't been called
that in a long time.

83
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:58,000
Isaac was the name I used in my
previous life back on Earth.

84
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,208
The emperor is from
the Mystic Moon?

85
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,000
No way, that's ridiculous!

86
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:05,541
You're the Isaac my father met.
The one he wrote about.

87
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,041
[DORNKIRK] I see now.
You must be Leon's son.

88
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,000
Fate has delivered
you here as well.

89
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:15,083
You know, he was
truly a wretched man.

90
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,333
He refused to reveal
the secrets of Atlantis to me.

91
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,125
How dare you!

92
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:23,000
[DORNKIRK] But in the end,
I didn't need your father.

93
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,750
I solved the mystery
of Atlantis on my own,

94
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:29,333
and now my Atlantis Machine
is finally complete.

95
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,000
I don't understand.

96
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,541
Why did you even come to
Gaea in the first place?

97
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,791
If you stayed on Earth,

98
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,916
this world would've
been so much better off!

99
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,166
[DORNKIRK]
I'm afraid I have to disagree.

100
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,666
Gaea may be soaked
in the blood of war,

101
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,791
but it has been that way
for a very long time.

102
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,583
Certainly long before I arrived.

103
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,875
It was the same on Earth.

104
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,041
Yes.

105
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,208
That's where all this
began, of course.

106
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,791
There's an idea took hold of me,

107
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,416
and I've never been
free of it since.

108
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,875
All bodies share
a common principle.

109
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,958
Based on their masses,
bodies create a force.

110
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,500
That force attracts them
to the center of the earth

111
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,333
as well as to other bodies.

112
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:09,666
This is gravity.

113
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,000
"But why does gravity
exist?" I asked myself.

114
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:16,166
Why should bodies be
drawn to one another?

115
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,166
Could there be a greater force
of which gravity was a part?

116
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,041
Something that controls the
universe with an unseen hand?

117
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,166
I came to believe that there is.

118
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,708
A force that gives
order to all life.

119
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,541
One that gives meaning
to each birth,

120
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,458
and purpose to every death.

121
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,458
Yes. The answer is destiny.

122
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:39,208
The fundamental force
that governs the universe.

123
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,875
Destiny?

124
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,041
[DORNKIRK] But how does
destiny function, I wondered.

125
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:50,000
Does it obey certain laws in
the same way gravity does?

126
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:53,125
I dedicated my life
to solving that mystery,

127
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:56,916
immersing myself in research
and experimentation.

128
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,666
Unfortunately,
despite all my efforts,

129
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,666
I never found the answers
that I had so hungered for.

130
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,416
I was at death's door.

131
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,708
And still, that hunger
had not abated.

132
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:12,458
If anything, it was
stronger than ever.

133
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,666
[ISAAC]
Please, I must know.

134
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,250
I must know the
principles of destiny.

135
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:26,791
[DORNKIRK] When I awoke, I
found myself in a strange land.

136
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:31,583
It was a desolate place with not
one, but two moons in the sky.

137
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,791
The second moon was blue.

138
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,958
[DORNKIRK] The land was barren.
And the climate harsh.

139
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,333
Its people survived

140
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:42,416
by harvesting what little
the earth yielded.

141
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,583
They struggled on,
living in constant fear

142
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,750
of an invasion from their
neighboring countries.

143
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,916
Theirs was a hard
and brutal fate.

144
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,500
[DORNKIRK]
And then I had a realization.

145
00:09:56,583 --> 00:10:01,125
My purpose in this new world
was to guide these poor people

146
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,000
to a better life.

147
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:07,166
I gave them everything I had
and explained all that I knew.

148
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,375
I taught them what we
on Earth called "science."

149
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,916
Using that science,

150
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,250
they learned how to tame nature
and bend it to their needs.

151
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,458
Harvests began to improve.

152
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,125
I also taught them to
drive away their enemies

153
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,625
and to forge their
own destinies,

154
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:27,250
rather than allowing a cruel
destiny to rule them.

155
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,125
Through all those trials
and tribulations,

156
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:34,166
a great and powerful
new empire emerged.

157
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,041
We called it Zaibach.

158
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,166
I sought to learn more
of my adoptive world.

159
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,083
In time, rumors came to my ear
regarding the creation of Gaea.

160
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,541
And so, I heard the
legend of Atlantis.

161
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:53,291
And learned of the ancients'
ability to manipulate destiny.

162
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,875
Since then, I have
devoted all my time

163
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:59,833
and dedicated all my resources
to continue my research.

164
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,291
And here, at long last,
is the result.

165
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:06,000
A device with the power
to control destiny.

166
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,125
[DORNKIRK]
The people of ancient Atlantis

167
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,666
could convert human
thought into energy,

168
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,250
an ability that gave
them immense power.

169
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:26,375
In fact, Gaea itself is
one of Atlantis' creations.

170
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,666
Nobody could do that.
It's impossible!

171
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,125
[DORNKIRK]
I sought to build a machine

172
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,833
that would duplicate the
Atlanteans' capabilities.

173
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,041
In order to do so, however,

174
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,291
I needed to access the Power
Spot that was left here on Gaea

175
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,333
by its ancient creators.

176
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,791
That is why I had
to conquer Freid.

177
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:46,333
Obtaining that brought me
one step closer to my goal.

178
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,750
And now, at last,
the remaining key,

179
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:53,083
the dragon Escaflowne,
is in my hands.

180
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,166
But why Escaflowne?

181
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,083
So long the legendary Atlantis
Machine has filled my dreams.

182
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,916
This is the culmination
of my life's work.

183
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,666
The Fate Alteration Engine
is finally complete.

184
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,416
Controlling fate
is not possible.

185
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,333
[HITOMI]
How could you?

186
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:13,625
Using some sort of machine
to alter the world's destiny?

187
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:17,250
How many people have you killed
for your own selfish goals?

188
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,250
You had no right to their lives!

189
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,875
[DORNKIRK]
Individual sacrifices

190
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,750
are sometimes necessary
for the good of all.

191
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,000
A small misfortune

192
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,666
becomes the cornerstone
of something greater.

193
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,666
If I succeed in
creating a perfect fate,

194
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,333
the happiness that will result

195
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,250
will be worth the lives
it may have cost.

196
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,125
But that's crazy.

197
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,333
No, more than that.
It's just wrong!

198
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,625
Happiness that's created by a
machine isn't happiness at all!

199
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,500
It's a cheap lie!

200
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:58,875
[ALLEN]
Hitomi?

201
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,333
[VAN]
Are you okay?

202
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,208
I invite you all
to watch with me.

203
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:07,791
Watch the new fate of mankind.

204
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,541
[DRYDEN] Staring out there isn't
going to save them, y'know.

205
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,916
[DRYDEN] I was just
speaking with Gaddes.

206
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,458
We're going to
return to Asturia.

207
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,625
So your plan is to abandon
them? You disgust me!

208
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,041
[DRYDEN]
I'm sorry, Princess,

209
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,291
but we don't really have
a way to tell where they are.

210
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,458
Flying around in circles

211
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,375
would only be a waste
of time and fuel.

212
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,333
A waste of time and fuel?

213
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,875
Spoken like a merchant!

214
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:39,625
Yes. That's what I am, Princess.

215
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:43,291
I know those Zaibach guys are
serious about destroying Gaea.

216
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,375
I'll do everything I can
to try and stop them,

217
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:49,000
but it will have to
be done my way.

218
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,625
Don't worry. I have faith
they'll be back soon.

219
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,375
How can you?

220
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,791
It may sound strange,

221
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,375
but I think everyone's wishes
are connected somehow.

222
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,583
Who knows.

223
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,458
Maybe that's just me
hoping that someday

224
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,250
my wishes might get
through to somebody.

225
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,583
[SORCERER C]
So, this is the final key

226
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,583
to a Fate
Alteration Engine.

227
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,875
[SORCERER C] It's hard to
believe that an Ispano Guymelef

228
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,958
would have that
kind of capability.

229
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,458
We must do whatever it takes

230
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,125
to solve this mystery
without any assistance.

231
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,583
No matter what,

232
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,583
we cannot allow Folken to gain
any more ground over us.

233
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,875
[ALLEN]
Thank goodness, you're awake.

234
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,833
How're you feeling?

235
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,208
[HITOMI]
Where...?

236
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,833
A dungeon of sorts, but
at least we're still alive.

237
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:58,125
[HITOMI] Back there...
I had another vision.

238
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,333
In it, the ground fell away
and then the world exploded.

239
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,750
That sounds frightening.

240
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,666
You think it was an image
of Atlantis' destruction?

241
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,583
I'm not sure. But I think
it was something bigger.

242
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,125
[VAN]
Something bigger?

243
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,666
Maybe what you saw was
actually the fate of Gaea.

244
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,958
[HITOMI]
Don't say that.

245
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,500
[VAN] It's just like
my mother told me.

246
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,375
She warned me about
the power of Atlantis.

247
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,875
She said it must
not be awakened.

248
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,208
If Dornkirk activates the
Fate Alteration Engine,

249
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,666
then Gaea might meet the
same fate as Atlantis did

250
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,250
and be obliterated.

251
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,750
No way.

252
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,625
[VAN groaning]

253
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:33,833
[HITOMI]
Van?

254
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:44,125
Van! What is it? What's wrong?

255
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,375
This isn't good.

256
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,541
They must be trying to
disassemble Escaflowne.

257
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,166
If they do...

258
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,875
Please! Just hang in there, Van!

259
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:01,958
What is it?

260
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,500
Of course...

261
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,958
Van! Listen, if you can
feel Escaflowne's pain,

262
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,041
then it should work
the other way around too!

263
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,833
If your thoughts can reach it,

264
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:14,500
you should be able to operate it
no matter how far away you are!

265
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,250
[ALLEN]
Huh?

266
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,958
Hitomi.

267
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,333
I'll help you, okay?

268
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,833
If we work together, I know
we can make it happen!

269
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,375
No, it's too dangerous!

270
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,416
You'll be feeling
the same pain he his!

271
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,000
Allen's right, there's no need
for you to suffer like this.

272
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,708
Would you quit
being so stubborn?

273
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,291
If we don't hurry up
and do something,

274
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,041
then you're going to die!

275
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,125
Now please, give me your hand.

276
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,000
[ALLEN]
Please don't do this.

277
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,708
[HITOMI]
It'll be okay. We can do this.

278
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:49,000
[DORNKIRK] What in the world
are those two doing?

279
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,583
What's happening?

280
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,458
[HITOMI groans]

281
00:16:58,541 --> 00:16:59,500
Hitomi.

282
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:04,250
I'm okay. Van,
focus on Escaflowne.

283
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,333
Keep concentrating.

284
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,916
You can do this. Come on...

285
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:17,541
[VAN]
Move... Come on, move!

286
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:22,375
[HITOMI] Escaflowne....
please... help us!

287
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,291
What?

288
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,083
[SORCERER B]
No! This is impossible!

289
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,708
[SORCERERS yelling]

290
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:42,500
[DORNKIRK] I don't understand.
Why can't I see?

291
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,875
[DORNKIRK] The girl from the
Mystic Moon. Is this her power?

292
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,333
Escaflowne's here!

293
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,833
Yes! Can you believe it, Van?

294
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,000
We actually brought it to us!

295
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,291
Quick, we need to find an
escape route, right away!

296
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,500
I'm on it!

297
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,875
It's a Guymelef!
Allen, take Hitomi!

298
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:21,916
Right.

299
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,041
Van!

300
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:34,333
I'll hold them off! You just
protect her, got it?

301
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,458
[HITOMI]
No!

302
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,208
[VAN]
Go on ahead!

303
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:42,250
Listen, we'll meet up
on the roof. Get going!

304
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,333
Okay, then.

305
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:50,708
But be careful. Come on,
let's get to the roof.

306
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:51,791
[ALLEN]
Let's go.

307
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:09,958
[DORNKIRK] Hm? I can see
them again. Why is that?

308
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:15,791
Which way?

309
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:16,833
[HITOMI]
Um.

310
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,750
Over there!

311
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:23,500
Right, let's go!

312
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,666
[HITOMI]
Yeah!

313
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,166
I hope Van's doing all right.

314
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,625
He'll meet us on the
roof soon. I'm sure of it!

315
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,791
[ALLEN] You have a lot of
faith in him, don't you?

316
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:41,791
[HITOMI]
Huh?

317
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,291
[ALLEN]
Nothing. Never mind.

318
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,833
This city seems so
lonely and desolate.

319
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,666
I wonder if the people
here in Zaibach

320
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,291
are really happy
like Dornkirk said.

321
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,166
[ALLEN]
We've got company.

322
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,000
I'll never let you have Hitomi,

323
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,333
even if it costs me my life!

324
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,791
Allen! Hitomi! Get on!

325
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,625
Van!

326
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,833
Here, hurry!

327
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,125
Coming!

328
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,500
[ALLEN]
Let's go!

329
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,458
Right, hold on to something!

330
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,416
Hurry! They're gaining on us!

331
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,166
Please, Escaflowne,
we must go faster!

332
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,250
They're gaining!

333
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,083
Come on, faster!

334
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,333
[HITOMI yelps]

335
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,708
[DORNKIRK] When the dragon
and the girl are close together,

336
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,500
the image of the future wavers.

337
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,375
One way or another,

338
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,958
that girl from Earth will
be the key to everything.

339
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:06,583
I must find a way
to separate them.

340
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,291
[ARMORED SOLDIER A] There's
an object closin' in on us.

341
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,958
It's remarkably fast.
Be on alert.

342
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,791
Allen, please, that hurts.

343
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,750
Uh. Sorry about that.

344
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,583
[HITOMI] I can't believe
Dornkirk, emperor of Zaibach,

345
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,875
is actually a man
from the Mystic Moon.

346
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:55,291
Fate really does work
in mysterious ways.

347
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,750
[NARRATOR]
Escaflowne.

348
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:12,791
[MILLERNA]
Please do a reading for me.

349
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,583
[HITOMI]
He reminds me so much of Amano.
