followed your prediction and

They were always gonna
attack us, no matter what.

Besides, I don't believe
in fortune-telling,

so I wouldn't have
listened to you.

It's okay.

before they learned of

160
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,208
We must be ready to greet her.

161
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,375
Dispatch the Intensified
Luck Soldier

162
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,875
to that location at once!

163
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,375
We can't do that!

164
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,041
She hasn't fully recovered
from her recent injuries yet.

165
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,583
[DORNKIRK] That will not
inhibit her success.

166
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:35,500
There is nothing to fear. The
device is functioning normally.

167
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,625
[FOLKEN]
But, sir.

168
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,041
[ERIYA]
Lord Folken.

169
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,666
You don't have to
worry about me.

170
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:45,625
I can handle this. I beg of
you. Let me prove my worth.

171
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,083
[FOLKEN]
Eriya.

172
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,750
Where is she? Come on.

173
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:01,916
[gasps]

174
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,083
One of those luck soldiers!

00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,000
[GADDES]
Hafta say, I'm surprised.

176
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,791
I was sure they'd use this
harbor to make their escape.

177
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,458
[ALLEN]
As was I.

178
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,500
Prep Scheherazade
for deployment.

179
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,416
[GADDES]
Yes, sir.

[ROYAL GUARD B]
Look!

181
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:27,458
No! I don't have time to fight
with you right now, dragon!

182
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,541
Get back here!

[VAN]
Uh. What the...?

184
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,541
Is this more of
that damn luck of theirs?!

[yells]

186
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,458
It's no use.

187
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:59,333
I can't get anywhere close like
this. It's time for Plan B.

188
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,333
[VAN]
Where are you, Folken?

189
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,583
[VAN]
I've found you!

190
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,666
[HITOMI] Whatever you do,
don't go back to Folken!

191
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,000
If you're gonna take this ship,

192
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:23,000
use it to get someplace
far away!

193
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,958
Don't you understand all
he's doing is hurting you?

194
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,958
Using a machine to
change your body.

195
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,833
Even if it's done for the
sake of someone you love.

196
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,625
It isn't right!

197
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,708
Be quiet.

198
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:41,416
I won't! It's wrong
and you know it!

199
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:49,250
[HITOMI] But. Doesn't she
care about herself at all?

200
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,916
[VARIE] You didn't
mean to, of course,

201
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,458
but your wishes were made
with a troubled mind.

202
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,708
Even now, the uncertainty
in your heart

203
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,166
is bringing forth grief.

204
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,125
[HITOMI]
My uncertainty?

205
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,916
[GRANDMOTHER]
Trust your feelings.

206
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,666
Believe in those around you.

207
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,375
Your wishes will come
true. Just have faith.

208
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,791
[HITOMI] Trust my feelings.
I have to have faith.

209
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,125
I'm surprised.

210
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,125
I thought you'd be more afraid.

211
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,458
[HITOMI gasps]

Do you not realize what's
going to happen to you?

00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,708
Well. I am afraid, but...

214
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:25,208
You're afraid? Then
why not try to run?

215
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,833
You could've escaped by
now if you wanted to.

216
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:31,666
But you're here. It
doesn't make sense.

217
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,041
[HITOMI] It's because...
I believe in you.

00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,500
[NARIA]
Uh?

219
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,166
I can feel it in my heart that
you're not a bad person.

220
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,375
And I'm trusting that
feeling with my life.

Heh.

all that matters to me.

00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,958
If I do that, then
I have no regrets.

I can't get through to her!

Come on, we have to go!

[NARIA] You asked
me what my name was.

250

Lord Folken gave it to me.
