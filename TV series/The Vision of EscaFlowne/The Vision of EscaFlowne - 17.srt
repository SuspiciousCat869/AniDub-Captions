1
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:03,500
Naria! What now?

2
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:06,208
[FOLKEN] I want you both
to hold your positions.

3
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,791
[NARIA]
But, Lord Folken!

4
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:11,333
That can't honestly be the
entrance to the Mystic Valley.

5
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:14,958
It's... It's just a fairy tale.

6
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,166
[KIO]
The helm's not responding!

7
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,541
Our lift indicator's
off the scale!

8
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,166
[VAN]
Impossible.

9
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,083
Did we truly make it through?

10
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:44,625
Yes. Looks like
we finally found it.

11
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,250
The lost capital of Atlantis.

12
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,916
So this is... the Mystic Valley?

13
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,208
[HITOMI gasps]

14
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,458
Hitomi!

15
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,708
[VAN]
Allen!

16
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,666
[MERLE]
King Van!

17
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,875
[GADDES]
What's going on?

18
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,250
[MERLE] How could they
all just disappear?

19
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,000
[KIO]
This is insane.

20
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:20,750
I see her!
Hitmoi's down there!

21
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,916
What's happening here?

22
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,958
None of my research
prepared me for this.

23
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,875
[HITOMI]
Hold on. I know this place.

24
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:35,041
Yeah. I've been here
in a vision before.

25
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:38,083
The vision I had
when Van almost died.

26
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,875
What is this place?

27
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,875
I'm in Fanelia.

28
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,416
[VARIE]
Van.

29
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,583
Is that you, Mother?

30
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,875
Celena!

31
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,333
No, don't go!

32
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,000
What is that?

33
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,833
[MERLE]
Hitomi!

34
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,166
[MERLE]
There you are!

35
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,083
Where's King Van?
What's happening?

36
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,708
Look at that.

37
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:59,541
This monument is decked out
with Atlantean writing.

38
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:03,375
No doubt about it.
These are Atlantis's ruins.

39
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,708
The Mystic Valley.

40
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,208
[MILLERNA] Do you have
any idea what it says?

41
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:12,083
[HITOMI] "New Galactic
Era. Thirteenth moon."

42
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,500
Wait, you can
actually read this?

43
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,916
"We, the Draconians,
are descendants of Atlantis.

44
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,125
Our people are born
of the capital,

45
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,250
which lies on the Mystic Moon

46
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,958
and will forever
be our true home."

47
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,750
Stop. You can't be serious.

48
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:46,250
So the Atlanteans really
came from the Mystic Moon?

49
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,458
"We are a broken people.

50
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,291
Though Atlantis's power
had become great,

51
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:55,041
and her children fit to surpass
the gods, it was not enough.

52
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,291
In their avarice, they
constructed a horrible machine

53
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,583
capable of transforming human
thought into energy.

54
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:05,166
It made them omniscient
and omnipotent.

55
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,833
It seemed their power
knew no limits.

56
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,791
Wings sprouted from their back.

57
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:14,291
They soared through the
clouds like angels. Until..."

58
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,583
That's my pendant!

59
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,083
[HITOMI] "Their desperate wish
brought forth a new world

60
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,500
to hang among the stars
in the heavens.

61
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,708
Its name was Gaea.

62
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,708
This was the final wish
of the Atlanteans:

63
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,291
It is with the
deepest of regrets

64
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,083
that we write these words.

65
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,416
Our only hope is that
none shall be so foolish

66
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,916
as to repeat our mistakes.

67
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,250
Gaea.

68
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,916
A beautiful world
embraced by the heavens

69
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,041
with blue, rolling oceans
and green, verdant land.

70
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,708
A second chance."

71
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:15,625
You're telling me they willed
our world into existence?

72
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,708
And the machine that can
turn thought into energy.

73
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,541
That must be the
mystery of Atlantis.

74
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,666
Or at least one of them.

75
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,166
[LEON]
I entrusted that to her.

76
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,250
Who're you?

77
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,500
[ALLEN]
Father.

78
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,583
[VAN]
What is this?

79
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,208
It almost feels like
a distant memory.

80
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,458
[BALGUS]
It is.

81
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,416
A memory from the
bloodstained Draconians.

82
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,250
The very same blood that runs
through your veins, King Van.

83
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,250
Balgus.

84
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,333
Now, listen.

85
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:02,041
You are Atlantis's progeny.
And thus, bear its destiny.

86
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:05,916
Although it is grave, you
cannot shy away from it.

87
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,041
You must fight in order
to prevent Gaea

88
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,750
from meeting that same fate.

89
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:13,250
This responsibility rests
entirely with you, King Van,

90
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,833
and no other.

91
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:19,291
You will have to take up your
steel in Escaflowne once again.

92
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,875
[VAN]
No. You're wrong.

93
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:25,291
I don't wanna fight anymore.
I hate it. Let me go!

94
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,125
[HITOMI gasps]

95
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,250
What is it?

96
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,916
I think I know
where they are.

97
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Van and Allen are inside.

98
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:34,666
Are you sure? How can
that be possible?

99
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,833
I'm sorry, Mother.

100
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,791
What is that?
What's happening?

101
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,083
[LEON]
Allen.

102
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,375
Is that really you?

103
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:57,208
[LEON]
My son, I'm glad you've come.

104
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:00,625
And it appears you
followed my wishes.

105
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:04,375
Now then. Where would
you like to begin?

106
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,625
You honestly think I have
anything to say to you?

107
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,500
[LEON] You managed to
be named a Knight Caeli.

108
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,833
Your mother must
be proud of you.

109
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:16,000
How is she? How is Encia?

110
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,250
[ALLEN]
My mother's gone. She died.

111
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,791
It happened while you
were off travelling.

112
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,916
I'm so sorry. I didn't
know that she had--

113
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,916
Are you actually crying?

114
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,458
[LEON]
It's natural to shed tears

115
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,875
when someone you love dies.

116
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,625
And I loved your mother dearly.

117
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,166
You liar!

118
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:43,583
How can you say that to me?
You're the one who left us!

119
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,125
I'm sorry, Allen.

120
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,375
[BALGUS]
Yes. You've always hated it.

121
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,541
Don't come closer!
Stay away from me!

122
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:05,708
[screaming]

123
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:09,041
Just go away!

124
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,541
Oh, no!

125
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:11,791
[MILLERNA] What is it?
What's wrong?

126
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,791
Are you all right?

127
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:14,916
[DRYDEN]
Huh?

128
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:17,958
Well, I don't know
what that means,

129
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,958
but I kinda doubt
it's anything good.

130
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,333
You don't think
we're gonna get stuck

131
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,291
if we stay here
much longer, do you?

132
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,208
[DRYDEN] This place both
is and isn't part of Gaea,

133
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,791
so it's hard to say either way.

134
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:31,041
Hitomi, you have to do
something about this, please!

135
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,458
[HITOMI]
I'm begging you.

136
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:40,000
Bring back Van. And Allen, too.
We have to get out of here.

137
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,458
[VARIE]
Don't do that.

138
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:46,625
You must refrain from using the
power of your wishes so freely.

139
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:47,833
While you mean well,

140
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,666
your desires are spawned
from your anxieties.

141
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,833
Your wishes make those
anxieties real,

142
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,958
bringing unintended
pain to those around you.

143
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,333
I'm the reason
they're suffering?

144
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,583
It's because of me?

145
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,875
Yes.

146
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,625
The difficulties your
friends have faced

147
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,458
were not chance happenings.

148
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:12,833
They were caused by you.

149
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,708
But how? I was only...

150
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,250
[VARIE]
Fortune telling?

151
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,500
Although your intention may be
merely to predict the future,

152
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,791
that isn't what
actually happens.

153
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,958
[HITOMI]
I did that?

154
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,458
[VARIE]
You didn't mean to, of course,

155
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,375
but your wishes were made
with a troubled mind.

156
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,375
And so they turned
your fears into reality.

157
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:46,708
The power of that pendant is not
something to be used lightly.

158
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:47,708
Yes.

159
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,125
Even now,

160
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,708
the uncertainty in your heart
is bringing forth grief.

161
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,250
I don't want it to be true.

162
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,208
It's my fault?

163
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,666
I'm the reason all these bad
things keep happening?

164
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,791
[HITOMI]
It's because of my wishes?

165
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:16,833
Because of me? I'm so sorry.

166
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,958
[HITOMI'S GRANDMOTHER]
Don't cry.

167
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,416
Have faith in them.

168
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,958
Believe in the people you love.

169
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,708
That's what they need.

170
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,666
Really, Grandma?

171
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,666
Where am I now?

172
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,333
Those are Zaibach soldiers.

173
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,541
They were on top of me

174
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,833
almost as soon as I
left the Mystic Valley.

175
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,875
I could neither run
nor hide from them.

176
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,625
They would do anything
for the mystery of Atlantis.

177
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,125
[ALLEN]
Atlantis?

178
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,083
[ZAIBACH SOLDIER A]
Lord Dornkirk.

179
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,958
We have secured the item,
as you requested.

180
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,416
So much trouble
for a simple thing.

181
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,291
No.

182
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,333
Damn you!

183
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,000
Stubborn man.

184
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:48,583
You still deny me the secret
of the Mystic Valley?

185
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,166
Even at the cost of your family.

186
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,041
At the cost of your life itself?

187
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,833
[LEON]
The power of Atlantis.

188
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,375
The power of my wishes.

189
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:11,750
I want to see that girl.
Please, just one more time.

190
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:25,250
It's really you. You came back.

191
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,166
And you haven't aged a day.

192
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:34,000
But it's been so long,
how can that be?

193
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,666
Then it's true.
It's really true.

194
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:42,041
The mystery of Atlantis
is the power of the heart.

195
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,041
My hunch has been
right all along.

196
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,583
That's how this is possible.

197
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,500
Take this, and remember,

198
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,458
our wishes really do come true.

199
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,000
No matter the distance,

200
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:02,000
they transcend time
and space altogether.

201
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,541
To make dreams real.

202
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:27,500
[LEON]
I'm sorry... Encia.

203
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,000
[ENCIA]
Leon.

204
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,166
[ALLEN]
Mother.

205
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,791
After all that time, she loved
my father to the bitter end.

206
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,500
And though I didn't believe
it, he felt the same way.

207
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,291
[LEON]
Yes, I did.

208
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,083
Then why did you leave us?

209
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:08,416
I married and became a father
out of duty to my family,

210
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,541
which meant sacrificing
my own desires

211
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,625
for the good of those around me.

212
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,875
When people are forced
to live like that,

213
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,791
they yearn to break free
from the thread of fate.

214
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,666
When I saw that girl
for the second time,

215
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,666
I finally understood.

216
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,083
All along, I had loved Encia.

217
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:31,750
And you. My beautiful son.

218
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,625
You mean that?

219
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:37,125
[LEON]
We humans are nothing but fools.

220
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:41,500
What good is having
Atlantis's power to grant wishes

221
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,000
when we don't even know
what it is we want?

222
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,875
I'm so sorry.

223
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:52,541

true to yourself.

235
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,541
That thing looks
dangerous to me.

236
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:34,625
Yes, I agree. Let's do
something about it.

Stop, both of you. What do
you think you're doing?

Don't worry so much.

get us through this.

We'll bring your little brother
back kicking and screaming.

Almost! We're almost there!

of our good fortune!

Hear that? The sounds of war.

247
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:24,791
[VAN]
No. I don't wanna fight anymore.

248
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,041
Please don't make me do it!

249
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,375

00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,125
Well, what do you know?

than I thought.

[PYLE]
What's going on?

00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,833
Now Escaflowne's here?

254
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,708
He'd better be careful.

255
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,583
[VAN] So you're the ones
who called me back.

00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,333
You should've let me be.

get away this time.

[BALGUS]
You must fight for your life!

260

The only way to escape
from the sorrow of war

261
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,083
is by your own
bloodstained hands!

[HITOMI]
But Grandma.

266
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,666
[HITOMI'S GRANDMOTHER]
If your fear and anxiety

267
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,083
are what's causing all of
these bad things to happen,

268
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:41,458
then the opposite should
be true as well, right?

269
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,958
It's simple.

270
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,916
Just have faith in your friend.

Okay, I'll try.

He's not shaking
like he was before.

00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:03,625
[VAN]
Escaflowne's pain is my pain.

275
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,583
The pain of war.

276
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,625
If this truly is my fate...

00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:15,041
...if the nightmare of war
is truly inescapable...

278
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,125
...I will shoulder its burden.

279
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,166
I will endure.

280
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:24,250
[VAN] And I will carry with
me the sorrow of the dead!

You must always remember, Van.

What will ultimately determine
Gaea's future... is your will.
