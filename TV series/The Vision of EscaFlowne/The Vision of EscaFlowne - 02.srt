1
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,916
[HITOMI]
Was it all just a dream?

2
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,708
Or was it a vision?

3
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,291
[HITOMI]
I learned that the guy I liked

4
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,500
was moving out of the country.

5
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,958
[HITOMI] My farewell
to him was interrupted

6
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:06,500
when the boy from my dreams
appeared, followed by a dragon.

7
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,666
[HITOMI] A mysterious
beam of light came down,

8
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,208
and I found myself
in a strange world,

9
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:18,000
where the Earth and
moon hung in the sky.

10
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,791
They have us surrounded.

11
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,416
[AMANO]
What a crazy night.

12
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,125
At least Kanzaki's mom
believed us about what happened.

13
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,208
And she even seemed hopeful.

14
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,583
She thinks Kanzaki
will come back.

15
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,833
Until she does,
I'm not going anywhere.

16
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,625
[YUKARI]
I'm glad.

17
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,833
Hitomi.

18
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,458
[RUHM] Seriously?
You went to the Mystic Moon?

19
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,750
So this girl
you've got with you?

20
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,750
A native. She followed
me home. Can I keep her?

21
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,000
Well, that's a
surprise all right.

22
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,958
You haven't been to
the village in how long,

23
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,375
and then you show up one day

24
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:25,250
sayin' you've gone to
another world and back?

25
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,250
You know, according
to village legend,

26
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,958
our people actually
used to travel

27
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,875
to and from the Mystic Moon.

28
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,958
I never imagined
the stories were true,

29
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,250
but maybe I was wrong.

30
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,000
Sorry. What is the
Mystic Moon, exactly?

31
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,708
Look up. See the pretty
blue moon there?

32
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:44,000
Supposedly that's
where you're from.

33
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,916
[HITOMI]
The Mystic... Moon.

34
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,208
[VAN]
What's wrong?

35
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,833
Uh, it's nothing. I'm fine.

36
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,916
[RUHM]
Now that I think about it.

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,583
The Mystic Moon has
been different lately.

38
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,791
A lot brighter than usual.

39
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,583
Maybe that's why strange
things have been happening.

40
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,125
[YURIZEN]
It's already been three days.

41
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,000
[ASONA] If he doesn't return,
what will become of us?

42
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,375
What will become of Fanelia?

43
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,291
[YURIZEN]
He's not like his older brother.

44
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:22,625
Surely he won't flee the
ceremony like Folken did.

45
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,250
[LUVA] Balgus, what's
your take on this?

46
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,333
I have been in charge of Prince
Van's education for ten years.

47
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,291
I know him well.

48
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,500
He's devoted himself

49
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,541
to preparing for the
rite of succession.

50
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,208
I can tell you this
without a doubt:

51
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,458
He wants nothing more
than to erase the shame

52
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,916
brought on the Fanel
family by his brother.

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Prince Van would never
abandon his duty,

54
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,458
even if that dragon ripped
all the limbs from his body!

55
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:04,333
Well, that's Fanelia down
there. What do you think?

56
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,375
C'mon everybody, hurry!
Prince Van is back!

57
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,208
[WOMAN A] What? Is it true?
Is he really back?

58
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,083
[MAN B]
Opening the gates!

59
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:32,500
[VILLAGERS cheering]

60
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,416
[MERLE]
Prince Van!

61
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,875
Prince Van! You're back!

62
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:51,541
[VAN]
Merle!

63
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,583
[MERLE, VAN chuckle]

64
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,125
[MERLE] I'm just so happy
that you aren't dragon food!

65
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,541
I was worried to death.

66
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,875
I don't think I breathed
the entire time you were gone!

67
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,750
Okay that's enough. Easy,
Merle. Everyone's watching.

68
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,000
[MERLE] I can't help it.
I'm so relieved!

69
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,166
[VAN chuckles]

70
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,958
[VAN]
Aw, c'mon, cut it out.

71
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,791
First wolf men, now a little
cat girl. Where am I?

72
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,416
[BALGUS]
Prince Van?

73
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,958
It is you.

74
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,291
I see you've returned.

75
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,708
Hear me, all of you!
I, Prince Van Fanel,

76
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,916
have completed the
Rite of Dragonslaying

77
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,458
and have returned
with a Drag-energist!

78
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,666
He's not lying.
That's the real thing.

79
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,166
An authentic Drag-energist.

80
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:52,125
As the brigadier generals
of the samurai of Fanelia,

81
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:55,041
we verify your
completion of the rite.

82
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,625
It's good to be
home. Thank you.

83
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,458
[HITOMI]
He's a prince?

84
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,125
Ahh. Now there's
a smell I've missed.

85
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,458
Can't beat a
freshly-oiled Melef.

86
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,000
That's the trouble
with peacetime,

87
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,833
you don't get to use these
beauties often enough.

88
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,666
A tournament on
coronation day.

89
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,666
This is what I've
been waiting for!

90
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,833
[WORKER] Careful, sir.
You're not a kid anymore.

91
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,375
Don't push yourself.

92
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,708
[ASONA]
Hey!

93
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,333
[sighs]

94
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,333
[HITOMI] What am I doing
in this weird place?

95
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:16,125
[YUKARI] Hitomi! Hey!
Keiko's looking for you.

96
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:21,166
She wants you to do a
tarot reading. Come on!

97
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,958
Amano. I miss you.

98
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,875
[HITOMI yelps]

99
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,000
[HITOMI]
Jeez!

100
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,416
There's a door for
a reason, you know!

101
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,166
[MERLE]
Hmph.

102
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,625
Uh, can I help you?

103
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,500
You better keep
your paws off of him.

104
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,333
I've got my eye on you.

105
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,791
Just stay away from
Prince Van, okay?

106
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,708
You're a funny-looking
foreigner.

107
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,541
You don't need to be getting too
familiar with him, understand?

108
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,583
Uh. Who says I'm getting
familiar with him?

109
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,458
Hey! What're you doing?

110
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,166
Ah!

111
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,916
[MERLE laughing]

112
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,083
Quit digging through my stuff!

113
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,291
This is a really pretty stone.

114
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,791
I think I'll keep it.

115
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,458
[HITOMI]
Hey, stop! Damn it.

116
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,875
[HITOMI]
Come back here!

117
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,416
Talk about a cat burglar.

118
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,208
[MERLE chuckling]

119
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,375
[HITOMI]
Oh!

120
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,208
Don't think you're
getting away from me!

121
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,083
I'm an athlete!

122
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,916
[HITOMI]
Wait, what was that?

123
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:23,291
[VAN yelling]

124
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:45,041
You have to be more
aggressive! Really charge.

125
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,833
Come at me like you want nothing
more than to see me dead.

126
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:53,083
I don't like mortal sword
combat, Balgus. I just don't.

127
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,541
Listen to me, Prince.

128
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,166
In a short time, you will
become King of Fanelia.

129
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,041
You cannot afford to have
such weak sentiments.

130
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,375
[VAN] It's not like being king
is something I chose.

131
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,875
Don't say that!

132
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,875
We'll continue this later.
We have a guest.

[HITOMI]
I'm sorry!

135
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,000
The door was open.
I didn't mean to snoop.

136
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,708
Well then, what did you want?

137
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:19,333
Well...

[MERLE humming]

139

That's the problem
with you foreigners.

140

No manners at all.

141

Hey, you! Gimme back my pendant!

142
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,458
Stupid cat!

143
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,500
[MERLE]
Prince Van!

144
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,250
[BALGUS] I heard what
happened with the dragon.

145
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,875
It would seem that Prince
Van owes you his life.

146
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,041
We'll do right
by you, don't worry.

147
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,250
After the coronation
ceremony is over,

148
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,708
we'll do everything in our power

149
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,291
to return you
to the Mystic Moon.

150
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,375
Really? You will?

151
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:55,208
Don't doubt it. A samurai
of Fanelia never lies.

152
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,041
[RUHM]
Whoa!

153
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,125
Something smells off.

154
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,708
I don't see anything
out of the ordinary, though.

155
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,500
I guess it's nothing.

156
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,833
[VILLAGERS chattering]

157
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,333
[MERLE]
Aww.

158
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:37,041
No fair! I wanted to see
Prince Van all dressed up.

159
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,166
Why do I have to wait out here?

160
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,208
[HITOMI] A front-row seat
is more of an honor

161
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,041
than I was looking for.

162
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,541
[CORONATION OFFICIATOR] Rise,
Van Fanel, King of Fanelia,

163
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,833
and accept the sword
that I bestow upon thee

164
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,958
as proof of thy accession.

165
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,375
[SOLDIER A] Can't wait
for the celebration tonight.

166
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,875
[SOLDIER B] You gonna
bring that girl of yours?

167
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,458
[SOLDIER A]
You bet I am.

168
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,500
What was that, a mirage?

169
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:21,333
See something?

170
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:22,333
Nah.

171
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,375
[SOLDIER B]
Hm?

172
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,458
[SOLDIER C]
What's happening?!

173
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,416
What the hell?!
What is that thing?!

174
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,250
[SOLDIER C screams]

175
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,875
It's huge! A ghost?
A demon, maybe?

176
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,416
[VILLAGERS whispering]

177
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,833
Hey, do you see that?

178
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,208
Yeah, it looks like smoke.

179
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,291
[FANELIA MAN E]
Is it a fire?

180
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,416
[SOLDIER H]
We're under attack!

181
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,833
You hear me? It's an attack!

182
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,833
Get the women and
children to the mountains.

183
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,625
You men prepare
yourselves for battle.

184
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,166
Now! Clear the road!

185
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,291
An invisible enemy?

186
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,541
[ASONA]
Balgus.

187
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,375
Quickly, to your Melefs.
Hold them off!

188
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:40,708
And Luva, Asona, Yurizen,
I am counting on you.

189
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,375
[ALL]
Yes, sir!

190
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,000
And me? What should I do?

191
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,333
Leave the fighting to us.

192
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,583
For now, take Lady Hitomi
and go to the shrine.

193
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,583
Shouldn't I help?

194
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:49,666
No.

195
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,541
Majesty, should it
prove necessary,

196
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,083
take Escaflowne and flee.

197
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,333
Escaflowne? You're sure?

198
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,833
[SOLDIER I]
First cavalry, to the gates!

199
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,333
[SOLDIER J] Third squad,
to the western road!

200
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,833
[VILLAGERS yelling]

201
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,833
[MERLE]
King Van!

202
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,958
King Van, I wanna stay
here and help you fight!

203
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,500
Please let me stay with you!

204
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,583
Are you crazy, Merle?
We have to get out of here!

205
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,291
[MERLE]
King Van!

206
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,041
[GUYMELEF SOLDIER A screaming]

207
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:27,333
You damn cowards!
Show yourselves already!

208
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,625
Come on. Where are you?

209
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,458
You!

210
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,791
[groans]

211
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:42,875
Striking from behind.
Cowardly dog.

212
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,250
[SOLDIER K]
General!

213
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:49,541
I'm sorry, Balgus.
I fear I've failed you.

214
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,708
[GUYMELEF SOLDIER C groaning]

215
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,916
You're not going any
further while I'm alive.

216
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,041
[yelling]

217
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,208
I... failed.

218
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:52,458
[VAN]
I, Van Fanel, King of Fanelia,

219
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:56,291
bind myself by blood pact
to thee, Escaflowne.

220
00:16:56,375 --> 00:17:00,208
Your time has come.
Sleeping dragon, awake!

221
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,416
That's the giant.
The one from my dream.

222
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:24,791
Done.

223
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,541
[HITOMI[
Wait a sec!

224
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,000
[HITOMI]
What're you going to do?

225
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,125
[VAN]
What do you think? Fight!

226
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:57,333
Good. So the old texts
were right. I can work it.

227
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:24,625
So that's it.
That's Escaflowne.

228
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,750
Do you wanna get killed?
Hurry and hide somewhere!

229
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,583
Here they come.

230
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,375
Where is it?
Where is the enemy?

231
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,916
Quick, Van! To your left!

232
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,125
What?

233
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,083
Oh, no! Look out!

234
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,875
[groaning]

235
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,750
You're not getting away from me!

236
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,791
Another Guymelef?

237
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,916
Again, a giant from
my dream. But how?

238
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:43,125
[VAN yelling]

239
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,166
[HITOMI]
Van! Behind you!

240
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,500
[BALGUS yelling]

241
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:04,791
[HITOMI]
Balgus!

242
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,000
What's he doing?

243
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,500
[BALGUS]
King Van!

244
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,708
Take Lady Hitomi and get out
of here while you still can!

245
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,875
You really expect me
to turn tail and run?

246
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,125
[BALGUS]
Please, King Van!

247
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,500
[VAN yelling]

248
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,375
Incredible!

249
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,458
[BALGUS]
Go!

250
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,166
Get out of here, Majesty!

251
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,333
[VAN]
Damn it!

252
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,333
[VAN]
We're leaving! Come on.

253
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:12,041
Come on, Balgus. I'm not
leaving you behind!

254
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,166
No! Look out, Balgus!

255
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,416
[BALGUS]
Hm?

256
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Balgus!

257
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,750
Is he okay?

258
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:44,833
Your Majesty. You must
take Escaflowne.

259
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:46,541
Take it now and flee!

260
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:47,875
And then someday,

261
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:50,916
you can return and make
our land great once again.

262
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,583
You can rebuild Fanelia.

263
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,625
No. No, you can't die!

264
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:19,166
[HITOMI]
No. No! No!

265
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:44,500
You can't be dead... King Van!

266
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:04,416
[NARRATOR]
Escaflowne.

267
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,666
[MAN]
That was foolhardy.

268
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,958
[yelling]

269
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:13,416
[HITOMI]
Can it be? Is he the one?
