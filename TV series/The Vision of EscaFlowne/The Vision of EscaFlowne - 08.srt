Was it all just a dream?

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,541
Or was it a vision?

00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,708
That night I watched them
hold each other close

00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:57,291
on the roof of Palas' Castle.

5
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:00,958
I saw there was another side
to Allen that I didn't know.

6
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:04,791
Then Van and I flew away,
leaving them behind.

7
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,250
I know this is goodbye, Allen.

8

00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,166
[ALLEN] I threw away
everything I had to come here.

15
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,875
What do you mean?

16
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,041
[ALLEN]
My country... The war...

17
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,041
My duties as a knight...

18
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:03,125
I realized none of it
mattered without you.

00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,041
Sweetheart! Were
you waiting long?

Don't worry about it.

If you're tired, sleep.

Wait! I didn't say that, did I?

00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,166
You would think you'd
take this seriously!

38
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,708
We barely made it
out of there alive,

already forgotten

that you were almost sold
off to that Meiden guy?

No! I remember!

43
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,291
It's understandable; we wouldn't
be here if it weren't for Allen.

--[MERLE] Here.

Nah. They're way
better this way.

They're good!

Hey! Those were the

of this stuff?

And my watch, too?

Give me back my things!

[HITOMI]
Hey, Van?

65
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,750
[HITOMI] Is it just me,
or do these look similar?

00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,458
[VAN]
Yeah, I guess they kinda do.

67
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:55,625
Where'd you get that?

68
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:56,750
[HITOMI]
From my grandmother.

69
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:57,791
[VAN]
It was a gift?

70
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:58,875
[HITOMI]
Yeah.

71
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,416
She gave it to me
when I was little.

72
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,208
It's kind of like an heirloom.

73
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,958
But you have more
family, don't you?

74
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:06,666
Yup.

75
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,625
I have my mom and dad.

76
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,625
And also a little brother.

77
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,458
Oh, yeah? That sounds nice.

78
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,625
[HITOMI]
It's nice,

79
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,375
but my brother and I
fight all the time.

80
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,541
He's always mouthing off,
which drives me completely nuts.

81
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,000
And then, of course, I'm the
only one who gets yelled at.

82
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,750
"Hitomi! You're his big sister!

school now, so grow up.

act like a girl!"

That kind of thing.
I get so sick of it.

sits there the whole time

I wonder how they're doing.

I miss them... a lot.

90
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:56,625
I... I know how you feel.
My folks passed away.

91
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,458
It happened when I was little.

92
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:01,958
Now Fanelia's burned down,
and Balgus is gone.

93

I don't have much
family left anymore.

94

It's basically just her.

I'm sorry.

96
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,291

that guy you called "brother."

[HITOMI gasps]

101
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,958
[VAN] Ten years ago, he was
sent off to fight a dragon.

102
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:29,000
That's part of the rite
to become king in Fanelia.

103
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:32,541
But he ran away and
joined Zaibach instead!

104

That bastard has even
tried to kill me!

No, I'm sorry.

So what do you think
you're gonna do now?

If I've learned one
thing through all this,

109
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,541
it's how much I
still have to grow.

110
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,333
And I'll start with the sword.

111
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,625
I'm gonna train and get better.

What will you do?

H-Honestly, I don't know.

There's no way I can go
back to Allen's country

You never know, there's a chance
I might need your help someday.

00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,541
Besides, I want
to help you, too.

122
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,916

to send you back home.

[MILLERNA] Father, what
is the meaning of this?!

128
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,083
Why have you thrown
Allen in the dungeon?!

129
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,708
Because there's no
telling what trouble

130
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,541
he would get into otherwise.

131

Think of it as a necessary
precaution, my dear.

132
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,125
And just what do you
think he's capable of?

133
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,833
[KING ASTON] Quite a bit,
considering he aided

134

in Escaflowne's escape.

135
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:33,291
And he's made it perfectly clear
he wishes to defy Zaibach.

It's madness!

within our country's borders?!

Zaibach doesn't
consider us allies.

161
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,666
The Dragons' Graveyard!

162
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,208
That reading you did was
supposed to lead to safety!

163
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,458
But this place is
crawling with bad guys!

164
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,750
I'm sure the cards said
this was a good direction.

165
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,500
Were they wrong?

166
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,083
[VAN]
Nah, not at all.

167
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,708
This is right where
we want to be!

168
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:12,750
[HITOMI]
Huh?

169
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,375
I'm taking us closer!

170
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,708
[GUARD A]
Who's there?

171
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,958
--Princess Millerna?
--[ALLEN] Huh?

172
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,833
[GUARD A] M'lady, this
is no place for you.

173
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,000
It's all right my father has

174
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,958
given me permission
to come down here.

175
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,291
[GUARD A] That's the first
I've heard about it.

176
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,125
[MILLERNA]
Oh!

177
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,625
[yelps]

178
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,708
--[GUARD A] A-Are you all right?
--[MILLERNA] Oh, it hurts!

179
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,250
Is there anything I can do?

180
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,208
[MILLERNA]
I don't know; it feels broken.

181
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,166
Do you think you could
take a look at it?

182
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,041
--[GUARD A] Uh...
--[MILLERNA] Please?

183
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,208
Hey, Commander.

184
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,166
[ALLEN]
Gaddes!

185
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:58,875
[MILLERNA]
Hurry!

186
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,125
--Let's go!
--Right!

187
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,250
[HITOMI]
What's the Dragons' Graveyard?

188
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,458
[MERLE]
Hm?

189
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,333
What it sounds like:
where dragons go to die.

190
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,291
[HITOMI] Huh? So what
are they digging for?

191
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,708
[MERLE] They're digging up the
fossils to take their Energists.

192
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,208
I'm counting six Guymelefs.

193
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
[HITOMI] Okay, and what do
they do with the Energists

194
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:19,250
once they've got them?

195
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,500
[MERLE]
Hm? Oh.

196
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,875
Well, they, uh...

197
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,416
[VAN] Use them as power
sources for their Guymelefs.

198
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,666
[MERLE laughs]
That's right!

199
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,000
What he said.

200
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,458
Hold on, if that's the case...

201
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:32,958
[VAN]
That's right.

202
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,333
Escaflowne is powered
by an Energist, too.

203
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,000
Although, technically these
are called Drag-Energists

204
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,500
because of where they come from.

205
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,041
And what do they do exactly?

206
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,833
[VAN] The Drag-Energists
they take from here

207
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,500
will power their
Guymelefs and Leviships.

208
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:50,500
Mining these Dragon Graveyards
is a very serious business.

209
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,041
In a war, the side with the
most Energists will win.

210
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,458
Simple as that.

211
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,916
[HITOMI]
Huh?

212
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,958
Okay, the two of you stay here.

213
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,583
What? Why?

214
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,125
I refuse to let
Zaibach take them.

215
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,666
[ALLEN] The empire's going to
attack the Duchy of Freid?

216
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,250
Are you sure?

217
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,583
[MILLERNA] I am, and my father
will do nothing as Prince Chid,

218
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,375
his own grandson, dies!

219
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,958
Unbelievable.

220
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,791
Yes, and you're the only one who
stands a chance at stopping it.

221
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,125
But I'm not going to
let you do it alone.

222
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,208
[TEO]
When's the boss gonna get here?

223
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,208
They're gonna find us
if we stay much longer.

224
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,291
[REEDEN gasps]
Here he comes!

225
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,500
[GADDES]
Whoa!

226
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,458
All right! This is our stop!

Eries!

230
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,708
Listen, I promise I won't tell
father about this, Millerna.

231
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,750
But you have to come back
to the castle with me.

232
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,125
Tell him whatever you
like I'm not going back.

233
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,708
I'm leaving today!

234
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:51,916
My mind is made up!

235
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,291
I'm going with Allen
and you can't stop me!

236

[yelps, gasps]

Allen!

238
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,500
Stop! What are you doing?

239
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:00,708
Put me down!

240
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,291
I'm not going back;
I want to stay with you!

241
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,041
Tell me.

242
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,708
What is the meaning--

243
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,750
Take care, Princess.
And goodbye.

I'll be off then.

I'll find you.

I'm not going to give up.

do something about it already!
