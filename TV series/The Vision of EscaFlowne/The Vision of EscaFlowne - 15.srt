Van! Snap out of it!

00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:51,750
[MILLERNA]
What is it? What's wrong?

3
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,416
It's Van! He's in trouble.

4
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,083
Say something! Open your eyes!

5
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,166
Van!

Wait, be careful!

9
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,416
You might not be
able to come back!

10
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
Remember the Doppelganger!

11
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:10,833
Hitomi!

12
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:14,625
[HITOMI] I have to do
something, or Van may die!

13
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,333
Wait! No!

14
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,125
Hitomi...

15
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,833
[HITOMI]
Van, where are you?

16
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,583
Van!

17
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,625
Wait! I'm coming!

18
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:43,208
No!

Van. Let's go back.

Everybody's waiting.

[SOULS screaming]

00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,083
A fire.

35
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:59,166
Come on! You have
to snap out of it!

36
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,833
[HITOMI gasps]

37
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,041
[DRYDEN]
It's been three miets.

38
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,208
[MILLERNA] We have to bring her
around or they'll both die.

39
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,708
Wait, no!

40
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,958
Hey! Listen to me!
You can't give up!

41
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,583
Get your act together and
bring King Van back here!

Hey! Can you hear me?

00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,083
Please, King Van!

44
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,083
That sounded like Merle.

00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:50,083
[MERLE]
King Van!

Merle!

00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,958
You did it. You brought us back.

What a bunch of incompetents.

What did you do?

00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:32,333
There's no glory in getting
yourself slaughtered like that.

[CHILD] Please! Please
don't leave me alone!

[DORNKIRK]
With the conquest of Freid,

72
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,500
the Power Spot is ours.

73
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,666
However, we have
another concern.

74
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,916
[FOLKEN]
I believe you mean the dragon?

75
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,250
[DORNKIRK]
Yes.

76
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,333
The fate of the dragon
remains shrouded in mist,

77
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,375
growing ever dimmer
as time passes.

78
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,125
Yes, Imperial Majesty.

79
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,125
Fortunately, I already
have a plan in motion.

80
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,000
[DORNKIRK]
Capture the dragon.

81
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,500
You must capture it!

[VAN pants]

85
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,625
This shaking...

86
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,541
It happens every time
I hold my sword.

87
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,250
Poor Van.

88
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:14,250
Ah. Allen?

89
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,625
[ALLEN] Don't worry
about Van. He'll recover.

90
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:17,750
How do you know?

91
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,708
He's been like that
since the battle.

92
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,250
I've seen it many times.

93
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,583
This is a trial all
swordsmen must endure.

94
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,208
[gasps]

95
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,041
Something I've endured
myself, in fact.

96
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,500
Grief can make people
do foolish things.

97
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,958
Especially arrogant young men.

98
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,458
[BALGUS]
I've heard of you.

99
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,833
You're the boy who's been
picking fights with swordsmen.

100
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,583
Seems like a reckless
thing to do.

101
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,000
[ALLEN] Heh. It sounds like
you're scared to fight me,

102
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,750
old man. Why not drop
the purse and walk away?

103
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,791
If you do that, I'll see
fit to spare your life.

104
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,958
[BALGUS] You hold your sword
skillfully enough, anyway.

105
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,166
What's your name?

106
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,375
I am Allen Schezar. Fight!

107
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,833
[yells]

108
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,583
[BALGUS]
You have excellent technique,

109
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,583
but that isn't enough.

110
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,666
True swordsmanship is much more.

111
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,291
You're not there yet.

112
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,375
[ALLEN]
Kill me!

113
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,208
[BALGUS]
Hm?

114
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,375
Just kill me and have done!

115
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,666
Why are you so eager to die?

116
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,375
[ALLEN] I have no family
or home, only my sword.

117
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,000
Life isn't worth living
if I've been defeated!

118
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,041
[BALGUS] Swordsmanship
isn't about strength.

119
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,666
It's not about technique.

120
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,708
It's what about lies within you.
That is what matters.

121
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,791
Your skills are sharp.
Hone yourself.

122
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,208
[ALLEN]
And that was how I met Balgus.

123
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,041
He became my master.

124
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,750
I was so frightened,
so lost, but with his help,

125
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,666
I was able to find my way.

126
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,250
Mastering the sword means
mastering yourself.

127
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,583
Someday I hope to match Balgus's
skill as a swordsman.

128
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,666
I haven't yet.

129
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,666
I don't know if I believe that.

130
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,666
[gasps]

131
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,458
[HITOMI]
You're an amazing fighter

132
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,875
and a great commander.

133
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,208
And you're kind, too. And smart.

134
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,416
I don't know much,
not about swords

135
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,291
and that kinda thing, anyway.

136
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,291
I can't think of anything
I could say that would make

137
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:05,541
Van feel better, but I'm
sure he would listen to you.

138
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,750
You know all about fighting
and leading people.

139
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,208
Everyone really looks up to you.

140
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,958
I don't know if I've ever met
a guy I like as much as you--

141
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,708
[gasps]

142
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:18,291
[HITOMI] Uh... So, if you could
help Van, that would be great!

143
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,125
Well. Thank you.

144
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,458
You may not realize, but you're
a pretty special person

145
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,375
yourself, Hitomi.

146
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,333
[DRYDEN] Hitomi, the girl
from the Mystic Moon,

147
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,916
and the mysterious
power she possesses.

148
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,625
Van, in whose veins runs
the blood of the Draconians.

149
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,166
Escaflowne...

150
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,958
...and the Zaibach
Empire's pursuit

151
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,541
of the Power Spot.

152
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:52,958
An incredible confluence of
strange events and people.

153
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,583
[groans] What does it all mean?

154
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,375
I keep feeling like
I almost have it!

155
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:01,333
Excuse me, but I, um...
I want to thank you.

156
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,000
Yeah? For what?

157
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,250
Spare me the court
manners, please.

158
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,791
Bows and timidity
don't suit you at all.

159
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:12,041
What's the matter with you?
There's no need to be rude.

160
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,625
I came to thank you
and to apologize

161
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,041
for how I acted before.

162
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:19,875
[laughs] There we go!
Confident and direct.

163
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,916
That's much more your style.

164
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,416
Well, I had ulterior
motives, of course.

165
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,416
I'll do anything to get
a lady's attention.

166
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,750
I'm sorry. It's only...

167
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,708
[DRYDEN]
Allen, right? I don't mind.

168
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:36,208
I'll just wait. I always
get what I want in the end.

169
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,625
[gasps]

170
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,541
[DRYDEN]
Well, anyway.

171
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,375
There's actually something
I could use your help with.

172
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,833
I'm not one to take advantage,
but if you'd like to thank me...

173
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,625
[ALLEN] I believe this is
what you were looking for.

174
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,083
My father's final logbook,
from his study.

175
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,500
Ah! Yes! This is it!

176
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,833
An old book? Is that
thing really so important?

177
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,333
[DRYDEN]
It absolutely is!

178
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,000
This "old book" may be the
key to solving the mystery

179
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,583
that's at the heart
of all of this.

180
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:07,791
Mystery?

181
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,541
Why, the mystery of Atlantis.

182
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:10,916
[MILLERNA]
Atlantis?

183
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,625
When I was younger,
my father told me

184
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,041
about Leon Schezar
and his great quest.

185
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,250
He was searching for the
secret treasure of Atlantis.

186
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,416
I'm just going to
borrow this for a bit.

187
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,125
Look I get it.
The man's a celebrity.

188
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,708
But he is also
continuing to humiliate me.

189
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,833
Even out here in
the middle of nowhere.

190
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,041
We should just give it
to him and be grateful.

191
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,583
It's a bargain compared
to what he paid

192
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,083
to have Escaflowne
repaired for us.

193
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,291
You're right, of course.
Let him have it.

194
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,958
[HITOMI groans]
I'm a moron!

195
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:49,583
Why did I have to
go and say that?

196
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:54,250
Now he probably thinks I'm
some sort of obsessed fangirl.

197
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,708
[MILLERNA]
Hitomi?

198
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,666
Hey, Millerna.

199
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,875
[MILLERNA]
I, uh...

200
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,708
I was wondering if I
could ask your opinion

201
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,625
about a, uh, friend of mine.

202
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:03,875
Sure.

203
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,416
[MERLE]
Meow?

204
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,083
[MILLERNA]
Well, she's been seeing a man

205
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,791
who she likes a lot, but she
found out that he's really

206
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,083
a playboy and even fathered a
child that no one knows about.

207
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,208
[HITOMI gasps]
What a jerk!

208
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,916
[MILLERNA]
Just listen until I'm through.

209
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,166
[HITOMI]
Sorry.

210
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,000
[MILLERNA] Anyway, my
friend met another man.

211
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,916
He's kind of weird,
but he's wealthy,

212
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,583
and he seems very sweet.

213
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,458
He really appears
to care for her.

214
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,000
[MERLE groans]
Could you be any more obvious?

215
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,166
A friend? Really?

216
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,208
[HITOMI]
And?

217
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,875
Well, that's it.

218
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,666
What do you think
my friend should do?

219
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,250
That's really rough.

220
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,083
But, to be honest,
if I found out the guy

221
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,958
I was seeing secretly had a kid,

222
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,375
I probably wouldn't
ever speak to him again.

223
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,833
Really? Why not?

224
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,500
[HITOMI] Well, not only
does he have a kid,

225
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,166
but he didn't tell anyone?

226
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,208
That just seems really
messed up to me.

227
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,250
That's true.

228
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,083
He is very handsome, though.

229
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,125
What about the other guy?

230
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,000
Is he attractive, too?

231
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,000
Well, yes. I suppose
he is good looking.

232
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,750
Plus, he's good in
the money department

233
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,958
and he likes her.

234
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,958
Sure sounds like she
should go with him.

235
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,333
That's pragmatic.

236
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,166
I guess she could also
go out with both of them

237
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,291
at the same time.

238
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,833
But that's immoral!

239
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,250
Or she could give up
on both of them

240
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,666
and die all alone.
A poor, tragic heroine.

241
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,208
Stop that! You're teasing m--

242
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,041
You're teasing my friend.

243
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,833
And what about the fact
that she has feelings

244
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,541
for one of them?
Doesn't that matter?

245
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,125
Yeah, that's what makes
this so complicated, I guess.

246
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,458
It's hard to go against
what your heart is telling you,

247
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,166
even when your
head knows better.

248
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,041
It just feels wrong somehow.

249
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,000
What your heart is telling you?

250
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,250
I could do a Tarot reading.

251
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,541
You know, to see
which of the guys

252
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,000
would be better for your friend.

253
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,708
I'm pretty accurate
for other people.

254
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,291
[MERLE]
Please! Don't be stupid!

255
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,000
Who cares about your readings?

256
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,041
You wanna figure things
out for someone else?

257
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,708
Why don't you figure out your
own feelings first, huh?

258
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,666
What do you mean?
My feelings about what?

259
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,375
Once and for all,
Do you like Allen

260
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,625
or do you like Van?

261
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,541
[gasps]

262
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,166
[gasps]

263
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,458
Uh...

264
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,958
Gah!

265
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,833
Who's it gonna be?

266
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,000
It's not any of
your business, but...

267
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,000
I like Allen. I'm just...

268
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,083
I'm just worried
about Van, that's all.

269
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:18,416
[HITOMI] "Worried"? Is that
really all, though?

270
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,416
Then maybe you should
just stay away from Van!

271
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,958
Allen, too. He's out
of your league.

272
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,291
Thanks a lot, you guys.

273
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,333
[ERIYA]
That's it. It is, right?

274
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,916
I can't believe we
ran into them here.

275
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,125
Must be our luck.

276
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,791
What do you think
we should do, sister?

277
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,125
Let's go introduce ourselves

278
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,041
and get a present
for Lord Folken.

279
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,833
[NARIA]
That sounds good.

280
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,000
Things were goin' real good,
but then my old lady found us.

281
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,333
Aw, man. That's rough.

282

[CREWMEN yell]

283
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,000
[ERIYA] There's a Guymelef here
by the name of Escaflowne.

284
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,791
[NARIA]
You will send it out now.

do as you're told...

There it is.

323
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,166
[NARIA]
I know, but she is a cat.

324
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,708
[ERIYA]
I guess you're right. Let's go.

325
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,125
[sighs]

326
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,875
Merle!

327
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,750
You okay?

328
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,291
Ah!

329
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,875
I was so scared.

330
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,416
[whimpers]

331
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,458
But you're alive!

332
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,250
Oh, thank god!

333
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:07,041
I thought they were gonna
kill you! But you're all right!

334
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,041
[VAN]
Thanks to you.

335
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,875
[HITOMI]
So brave...

336
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:23,208
[DRYDEN laughing]

337
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,875
[DRYDEN]
I found it! I finally found it!

338
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,250
This is the confirmation
I was looking for.

339
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,375
The heart of the mystery
lies in the Mystic Valley.

340
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,416
What is the Mystic Valley?

341
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,375
The legendary place
where the Draconians

342
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,750
are said to have lived.

343
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:50,958
[gasps]

344
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:10,333
[NARRATOR]
Escaflowne.

345
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:11,958
I have heard enough!

346
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,583
Shesta!

347
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,833
He was from the
Mystic Moon, too?
