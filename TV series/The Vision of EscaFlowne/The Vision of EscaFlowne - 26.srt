[SOLDIER A]
What's that strange light?

2
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,375
[SOLDIER B] It's coming from
the capital of the empire.

3
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,750
[SOLDIER A]
Could it be?

4
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,541
[SOLDIER B]
It's finally all over.

5
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,833
The Zaibach empire has fallen.

6
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,666
Zone of Absolute Fortune?

7
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,666
[DORNKIRK] Yes. The activation
of the Fate Alteration Engine

8
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,666
has achieved what we intended:
A complete change of destiny.

9
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,708
It will grant
everyone their wishes,

10
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:38,166
creating perfect
happiness and harmony.

11
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,166
This is the ultimate purpose
of the Atlantis Machine

12
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,250
and the ultimate
test of its power.

13
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,541
That's insane.

14
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,958
Atlantis was totally
destroyed because of it!

15
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,583
[COMMANDER A] The Zaibach
forces are withdrawing.

16
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,333
[GENERAL A] Hmm. With the
majority of its army wiped out,

17
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,541
Zaibach is as good as gone.

18
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,500
It is the actions that we take
now that will truly determine

19
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:10,458
Basram's place in
the world, however.

20
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,916
Change course,
and Make for Norte!

[OFFICER A]
Huh?

22
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,166
We might as well strike down
those alliance pigs too

23
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,250
while we still have the chance!

[SOLDIERS yelling]

[OFFICER B]
It's the Daedalus army!

26
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,750
They're launching
a surprise attack!

27
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,458
So the moment our success
is ensured, they turn on us?

28
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,416
Then we will cut them
off at the knees!

29
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,250
Men of the Kingdom of Cesario,

30
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,875
go forth and seize your
moment of triumph!

31
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,458
Kill them all!

32
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,041
[GENERAL B]
Those worthless wretches.

33
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:40,541
Without our assistance, they all
would have fallen to Zaibach!

34
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:43,666
Give no quarter!
Annihilate them!

Enemy attack! Enemy attack!

[SOLDIER D grunts]

39

now shattered in pieces?

What the hell?

00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,125
They're all fighting each other!

Oh boy, Sarge!

Up ahead- A Basram leviship!

Huh?

There are the sniveling
Asturian cowards!

46
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,625
Strike them down at once!

47
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,000
Take us down lower!

48
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,500
They nailed us!

49
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:22,958

We just lost a levistone!

What the--?

53
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:35,875
Why are they
fighting each other?

54
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,000
Zaibach's the enemy!

55
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,000
Stop it. Now!

What's going on?

00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,708
Why are the allies all turning
against each other now?

58
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,500
[DORNKIRK] It's the destiny
they've chosen for themselves.

Sadly for you,

[DORNKIRK]
The Zone of Absolute Fortune

has granted everyone
their wishes,

68
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:20,166
but in so doing made
the fighting worse.

Given the chance,

people still embrace the
most violent of destinies.

It's almost as if that's what

[DORNKIRK] If it is

No! The point is, you have
to stop fighting, Van!

But I'm trying to put
an end to this war.

[VAN] Don't you get it?
I'm fighting to protect you!

205

[HITOMI] I never
asked you to do that!

You don't have to!

Besides, you aren't protecting

Oh, so that's it.

You're just worried
about your boyfriend.

I worry about you all the time,
and do you know why?

Because I care about
you more than anything.

00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,250
Why can't you
understand that, Van?

It will be all right.

[HITOMI]
How did you?

218
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,458
[FOLKEN] Some emotions
are powerful enough

to move the very heavens.

220

But when one heart holds
two conflicting emotions,

221
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:02,916
it can cause great strife,
and terrible unhappiness.

222
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
If that conflict
can be resolved,

223
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,375
much harm can be avoided.

224
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,958
So, you're saying that,
my heart is conflicted.

225
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:18,041
I know I feel bound to Van,
but in what way, exactly?

226
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,500
I've cared about him
deeply ever since we met.

227
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,500
And I believe in him.

228
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,958
Because I...

00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,541
I love Van.

00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,583
The truth is right
in front of me.

231
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,500
I really do love him!

didn't understand.

Just as I could not produce

00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,000
You're welcome to stay, if that
really is what you want to do.

326
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,583
[gasps]

327
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:22,208
But, you know, we can be
together anytime we want to.

328
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,541
So long as our thoughts
reach each other.

329
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,833
Van...

330
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:30,833
[HITOMI]
Here.

331
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,375
[HITOMI]
I want you to keep it.

332
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,916
Please.

333
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,375
[HITOMI]
I'll never forget you,

334
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,000
even when I'm old.

335
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,291
You're the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

336
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:49,583
[VAN gasps]

337
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:20,791
Goodbye, Van!
I won't forget you!

338
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,625
Hitomi...

339
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,583
Bye-bye, Hitomi!

340
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,875
[giggles]

341
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,375
Have a safe journey, Hitomi.

342
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:12,583
Goodbye, little lady!
Be good, now!

343
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,333
[SACHIKO]
I'm so jealous of Yukari!

344
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:24,458
[NAO]
I know, right?

345
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,791
She and Amano make
the perfect couple!

346
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:29,791
[SACHIKO] It's almost like they
were meant to be together!

347
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:31,750
[gasps]

348
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,166
Van...

349
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:47,625
Don't worry. I'm doing fine.
