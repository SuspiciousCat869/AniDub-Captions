1
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,916
[HITOMI] I'm sorry.
I'm just not sure.

2
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,833
[ALLEN]
But I am sure.

3
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:12,458
[HITOMI gasps]

4
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,333
Van, wait.

5
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,291
[footsteps]

6
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,625
[MERLE] Take those wet clothes
off before you catch a cold!

7
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,625
[MERLE grunts]
C'mon!

8
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,833
I did try to tell you to stay
away from her, you know.

9
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,250
Why couldn't you
have listened to me?

10
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:04,208
[HITOMI] Well then. I guess
I'll see you in the morning.

11
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,125
[ALLEN]
Hitomi.

12
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,583
[HITOMI]
Huh?

13
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,500
[ALLEN] Please make sure you
change into something dry

14
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:11,708
right away, so you
don't get sick.

15
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:12,791
You wouldn't want to miss

16
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,250
Millerna's wedding
ceremony tomorrow.

17
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,458
I hope you rest well.

18
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,666
[door closes, footsteps]

19
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,291
[ERIYA chuckles, gasps]

20
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,583
You almost won that one.

21
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,541
But I'm afraid that
almost doesn't count.

22
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,583
You arrogant little minx.

23
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,958
Heh. I'll concede this
one to you, though,

24
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,208
after the prize my luck
landed me recently.

25
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,833
[ERIYA] I'd say we're
more than even.

26
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,166
[NARIA]
Careful,

27
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,208
or I'll slap that smug
look right off your face.

28
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,291
Oh, do I detect a
note of jealousy?

29
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,083
Maybe.

30
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,333
[ERIYA grunts]

31
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,583
I want to know more about
Lord Folken's lips.

32
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,375
Were they warm?
How did they taste?

33
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:29,750
Let me feel them, too. Please.

34
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,250
Just for a moment.

35
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,208
[exhales]

36
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,583
[ERIYA grunts]
Quit it!

37
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,833
[NARIA sighs]

38
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,166
[ERIYA grunts]

39
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,041
[ERIYA]
Naria.

40
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:47,708
[NARIA] Don't you see? I want
to have Lord Folken's love, too.

41
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:48,916
[ERIYA]
There wasn't any.

42
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,458
[NARIA]
Huh?

43
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:54,208
[ERIYA] It wasn't how I dreamed
it would be, full of love.

44
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,625
I wish we had never kissed.

45
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,666
Lord Folken has been
very kind to us,

46
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,333
and we should always
be grateful for that,

47
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:04,291
but I don't think
he'll return our love.

48
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,791
[NARIA]
Still... we've been lucky.

49
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,125
[ERIYA]
Yeah.

50
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,500
[NARIA]
We almost died.

51
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,208
We would have if it
hadn't been for him.

52
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,625
[ERIYA, NARIA growling]

53
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,125
[FOLKEN whimpering]

54
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,708
You poor things.

55
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,416
Fate has not been
kind to you, has it?

56
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,250
[ERIYA, NARIA growing]

57
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,791
[FOLKEN groaning]

58
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,791
[FOLKEN] I will give you new
names and a fresh start.

59
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,666
Today... you will be reborn.

60
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,583
I promise this life
will be luckier

61
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,708
than the one you've known.

62
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,333
For a while that was true,

63
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,625
but our luck has been
pretty rotten lately.

64
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,208
You're right about that.

65
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,333
If we could just
beat the dragon.

66
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:20,541
[FOLKEN] You're not really
to blame for that failure.

67
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,833
At its current level, your luck
cannot overcome his power.

68
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,958
[NARIA, ERIYA]
Lord Folken!

69
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,375
Naria. Eriya.

70
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,333
I have news that
may cheer you up.

71
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,875
If you truly wish for it, I can
grant you even greater luck.

72
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,875
This luck would
be unparalleled;

73
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:40,041
with it you would never
again lose to anybody.

74
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:48,041
[MILLERNA sighs]
This isn't it either.

75
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,875
[MILLERNA]
How odd.

76
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:54,041
I could've sworn I had one
that would match perfectly.

77
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,541
[MILLERNA]
Mm?

78
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,083
[MOLE MAN]
Uh!

79
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,541
What are you doing here?

80
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,000
[MOLE MAN]
Mm...

81
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:18,458
[MOLE MAN grunts] Princess,
hello! No offense, but...

82
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,583
you used to have
this glow about you.

83
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,458
It seems to have
vanished recently,

84
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,291
and I wondered if
you were all right.

85
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,666
I thought I'd look in on you.

86
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,541
[MILLERNA]
Uh?

87
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,791
[MOLE MAN chuckles]

88
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,958
[MILLERNA]
Uh. Hey! Stop that!

89
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,166
[MILLERNA]
You found it!

90
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,958
[MOLE MAN] Hm...
How should I say this?

91
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,375
You have an abundance
of treasures

92
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,291
waiting right at your
fingertips, Princess,

93
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,666
but in the end only one of
them will suit you perfectly.

94
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,625
Choose wisely.

95
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,041
[FOLKEN]
I will completely replace

96
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,875
the blood in your
body with this liquid.

97
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,833
It's known as Fortune Blood.

98
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,083
[ERIYA]
Fortune Blood?

99
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,750
[FOLKEN]
Emperor Dornkirk's research

100
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,500
located people
throughout Zaibach

101
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,666
who were especially
lucky. From there,

102
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,166
he narrowed the field down

103
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,000
to those who were adept at
surviving against great odds.

104
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,833
From the nuclei
of their cells,

105
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:16,333
he was able to extract
what we call Fortune DNA.

106
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:20,041
He fused that DNA together using
the Fate Alteration Engine,

107
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,250
creating this artificial blood.

108
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:27,708
It's a risky procedure.
One mistake could kill you.

109
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,583
Please don't worry about
us. We'll be all right.

110
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,583
Not to mention the fact that
we're already pretty lucky.

111
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:34,833
[FOLKEN]
Hm.

112
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,791
[FOLKEN]
Intensify luck!

113
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,458
[HITOMI]
I can't help but wonder,

114
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,125
is this what's right
for Millerna?

115
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:13,875
[gasps, sighs]

116
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:14,708
[MILLERNA]
There you are.

117
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:15,708
[HITOMI gasps]

118
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,833
Millerna! Hi!

119
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:21,291
Hitomi. I need you.

120
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,000
[HITOMI]
A reading? But why now?

121
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,833
[MILLERNA] It's just...
I have all these doubts.

122
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:32,541
I-I'm worried Dryden might
not be the right one for me.

123
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,750
[HITOMI]
Come on,

124
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,541
this isn't some shotgun
wedding or anything.

125
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,250
[MILLERNA] I'm not
sure what that means.

126
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,500
[HITOMI]
I'm saying you've got

127
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,416
some pre-marriage
jitters is all.

128
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,333
[MILLERNA]
No. It's more than that.

129
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,541
[HITOMI] I'm sorry, I can't
tell fortunes anymore.

130
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,541
I know how dangerous it is now.

131
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,083
[MILLERNA]
Please, Hitomi!

132
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,916
If you do a reading for me,
I know it will put me at ease.

133
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,125
[HITOMI] But, what if I call up
some strange future again?

134
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,541
Listen, I need to know.

135
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:02,375
I'll believe whatever the
cards predict, so please?

136
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,750
[HITOMI]
Three of Serpents.

137
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:11,250
The Hanged Man and the Moon.

138
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,708
[HITOMI]
Tension... Self-sacrifice.

139
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,250
Uncertainty.

140
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,500
It's like she said,

141
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,083
she's worried about this
political arrangement.

142
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,791
She doesn't like being
pressured into it.

143
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:26,541
[gasps] Let's see,
the cards say...

144
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,500
you're feeling nervous because
the marriage seems so sudden and

145
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,708
you're overwhelmed
by all the changes.

146
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,541
Still, you shouldn't
be impulsive.

147
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,958
[HITOMI] Ace of Birds.
Five of Fishes.

148
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:42,166
The Devil. Five of Beasts.

149
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,916
[HITOMI]
If she gets married now,

150
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,833
then Millerna will
know a deep sadness

151
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,041
and be caught in
some kind of feud,

152
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,333
because of someone close to her.

153
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:53,333
[MILLERNA]
What's it say?

154
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,375
[gasps]

155
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,166
[HITOMI]
Um, give me a second.

156
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,750
Well, it looks like
there might be

157
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:01,583
a few small
difficulties at first.

158
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,041
[HITOMI]
The Lovers?

159
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,291
[HITOMI]
Whoa! What was that?

160
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,583
[MILLERNA]
Is something wrong?

161
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:09,625
[HITOMI]
Huh?

162
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,458
[HITOMI]
The Falling Tower?

163
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,500
This can only mean one thing.

164
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,916
The marriage is a mistake!

165
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,916
If I tell her these results, I'm
sure she'll cancel the wedding!

166
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,083
And then... She and Allen...

167
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,333
[HITOMI]
The Emperor.

168
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,791
The sign of good fortune.

169
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,916
I wonder, if I were to try
and switch out the cards,

170
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,666
what would it do?

171
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,708
Maybe I could draw a better
future into place.

172
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,375
[HITOMI]
That's it!

173
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,500
I can use the power of my will,

174
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,833
and call up a different
future for Millerna!

175
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,875
[HITOMI]
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,000
but if I wish for
it hard enough,

177
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:05,333
I can change your destiny
for the better.

178
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,541
[HITOMI]
Lucky you!

179
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,333
This card indicates
good fortune to come.

180
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,791
Basically, it says

181
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,666
if you go through with
this marriage to Dryden,

182
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,000
then you'll be happy!

183
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:21,958
You'll have a good
life together.

184
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,291
That's the outcome
of the reading?

185
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,875
I'll be happy with Dryden.

186
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,833
[HITOMI] Millerna, I really
do want you to be happy.

187
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,291
Hey, whatcha got there?

188
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,166
Um.

189
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,583
Well, It's kind of like a charm.

190
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,625
What does it do?

191
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,416
My hope is that it will bring
both of them good luck.

192
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,083
so that they'll have
a blissful marriage.

193
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,666
[PRIEST A]
O ye wise children of Asturia,

194
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,416
a land which is blessed with
rich earth and pure water

195
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,750
and embraced by
the sun's fair light.

196
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,333
We have come together
on this day

197
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,916
to bear witness to a
most blessed event.

198
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,583
Today shall see the joining
of these two people,

199
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,500
Princess Millerna
of Asturia, and...

200
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,875
[DORNKIRK] Now that the girl and
the dragon have been separated.

201
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,125
The probability graph
is stabilizing.

202
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:42,333
This is the perfect opportunity
to capture Hitomi Kanzaki.

203
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:46,708
That girl is the key to our
successful alteration of fate.

204
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:51,333
[FOLKEN] I understand and if the
dragon should try to interfere?

205
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:54,000
[DORNKIRK] If he dares
to challenge us yet again,

206
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,291
then he must be eliminated.

207
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,458
We won't fail you, Lord
Folken, not this time.

208
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,125
The luck you've given us
will make us invincible.

209
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,708
We will capture the girl
for you, I promise.

210
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,791
Please trust us in this.

No way!

Hm?

That looks like...
my brother's ship!

Peekaboo!

226
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,000
See? The dragon guided us
to their exact location!

227
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:06,000
I guess our luck really is
operating on a whole new level!

No, wait!

When I did Millerna's reading
earlier... I did this!

It happened because I tried
to manipulate destiny!

Give us the girl from the

that this marriage would
result in disaster.

could change it, so I...

the course of the future.

But why? Why do that?

Because, Millerna, I saw
the man you're meant for.

is, I love him, too!

Do you see now?

I didn't want to lose him to
you, so I changed the reading!
