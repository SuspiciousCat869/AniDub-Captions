1
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,625
[FOLKEN] This land of Fanelia
is guarded by dragons,

2
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,625
and yet hands borne
of those dragons

3
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,791
are the ones
that destroyed it.

4
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,833
Naria. Eriya.

5
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,916
We're very grateful to
you for saving our lives

6
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,416
all those years ago, my lord.

7
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,666
And we're happy our
last moments in life

8
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,541
can be spent with you.

9
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,875
I have worked so
hard for so long.

10
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:44,125
Yet still, my wishes are denied.

11
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,625
[KING's AIDE B]
We are not at war with them!

12
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,166
[KING'S AIDE C]
Indeed!

13
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,875
The empire hasn't announced the
abandonment of the alliance!

14
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:10,916
[DRYDEN]
Then we should probably

15
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,291
postpone any demands
for reparations.

16
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,833
[KING'S AIDE A]
Of course!

17
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,041
Zaibach is clearly
after only one thing,

18
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,333
and that's the girl, Hitomi!

19
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,375
If we turn her over,
that should appease them.

20
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,875
Give them what they want and
surely they'll leave us alone!

21
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,333
But their floating fortress
has been destroyed!

22
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:28,083
They still have an
axe to grind with us!

23
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,333
We shouldn't give them a
chance to strike again.

24
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:33,125
Deal with the problem
at its source.

25
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,875
If you hand Hitomi over to them,

26
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,166
that may lead to
Gaea's destruction!

27
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,500
[KING'S AIDE C]
The power of Atlantis

28
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,041
is nothing but a silly myth!

29
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,416
[KING'S AIDE B]
Our country will only be safe

30
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,958
if we maintain the
alliance with Zaibach.

31
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,958
[DRYDEN] I'm afraid
this is a fools' paradise.

32
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,458
Even if we were to give
Hitomi to Zaibach,

33
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,541
do you think that would
satisfy our people?

34
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,458
Countless Asturians
lost homes,

35
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,000
family, and lives during their

36
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,708
unprovoked attack
on our country.

37
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,000
Therefore, in King
Aston's stead,

38
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,416
I, Dryden, hereby decree that,

39
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,708
in accordance with the alliance
with our neighboring countries,

40
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:12,125
economic sanctions be
imposed against Zaibach.

41
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,708
[MAN A]
Folken's a shameful coward!

42
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,416
[MAN B] He fled the
Rite of Dragonslaying!

43
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,208
[MAN C] A sorry weakling
who abandoned his country!

44
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:27,625
You're wrong! My brother's
great! He's no coward!

45
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,083
--[door creaks]
--[MERLE] Meow?!

46
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,625
[MERLE]
King Van!

47
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,041
[HITOMI]
How did it go?

48
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:44,416
I'd like to believe that we're
making some progress.

49
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,416
[VAN] Words mean nothing.
We need action.

50
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,541
[HITOMI, ALLEN]
Uh?

51
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,625
Folken has disappeared again.

52
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,875
He's the one
responsible for this.

53
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:04,625
And I've had enough.
So, I'm gonna kill him.

54
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,708
You can't really mean that!

55
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:11,333
[VAN] I am Fanelia's king. It's
my duty to avenge its people.

56
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,791
But you can't do that,
he's your brother!

57
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,708
There has to be
another solution!

58
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,958
[HITOMI] He sounds so
brutal and heartless.

59
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,875
This isn't like him at all.

60
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,291
[HITOMI gasps]

61
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,333
[ALLEN] It's fine to believe
in people, Hitomi.

62
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,791
But the truth is, no matter how
much faith you have in someone,

63
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,083
they may still disappoint you.

64
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:42,708
[HITOMI] Please, Allen.
Don't say things like that.

65
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,041
[NARIA]
Listen, serving Lord Folken

66
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,291
is all that matters to me.

67
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,750
If I do that, then
I have no regrets.

68
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:00,166
[HITOMI] Naria never stopped
believing in Lord Folken,

69
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,666
not even for a second.

70
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,458
[NARIA] All she'd do is get in
our way if we took her with us.

71
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:10,958
Let's go, Eriya! We have to
get back to Lord Folken!

72
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,750
[HITOMI]
He is Van's big brother.

73
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,333
[howling]

74
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,375
[HITOMI gasps]

75
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,500
[HITOMI]
Are those wolves?

76
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,333
[HITOMI]
Somebody is calling!

77
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:36,875
[howling]

78
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,500
[ADOM MAN A]
Hello, Van Fanel.

79
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,875
[VAN] Are you the
one who sent for me?

80
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,583
[ADOM MAN A] I have a message
from pack leader Ruhm.

81
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,875
Folken is expecting
you in Fanelia.

82
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,416
What?

83
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,833
[MAN C] I think Prince
Folken's gone for good.

84
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,458
[MAN B] Rumor has it
that he fled the country.

85
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,541
[MAN A]
I had a feeling he would fail.

86
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,458
He was too young to face
the Rite of Dragonslaying.

87
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,041
[BALGUS] That's enough!
Mind your own business.

88
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:19,583
No more rumormongering!
Don't you worry, Prince Van.

89
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:24,250
Prince Folken will surely
return to us. I have no doubt.

90
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,291
[VAN grunts]
Who's there?!

91
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,750
Oh. You startled me.
What do you want?

92
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,083
[ALLEN]
Escaflowne's vanished?

93
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,208
[DRYDEN exhales]
What's he thinking,

94
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,166
disappearing at
a time like this?

95
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,791
[MERLE meows]
King Van! Where are you?!

96
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,750
[GADDES]
Whoa!

97
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,166
Allen, have you seen Hitomi?!

98
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,916
I can't find her
anywhere in the castle.

99
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,500
Her room's been cleaned,
and her bag is packed!

100
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,791
Could she and Van have
gone off together?

101
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:05,958
That does seem likely.

102
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,583
[gasps] Do you think
she seduced him?!

103
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,708
I bet she did. She's
real sneaky like that!

104
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,416
[MOLE MAN]
I saw them last night.

105
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,750
Hitomi and Van,
I mean. [grunting]

106
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,875
Get outta there, ya derelict!

107
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,875
And it looked
pretty cozy to me.

108
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,125
What were you doing lurkin'

109
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,833
under the carriage
like that, huh?!

110
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,083
[MERLE]
Hey, mole man!

111
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,833
Did you really see them?
And don't you lie to me!

112
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:29,750
[MOLE MAN]
Yeah.

113
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,875
[MERLE]
Oh, no! They eloped! Oh!

114
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,250
How could you do it, King Van?
How could you leave me?

115
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,125
[ALLEN] When she
believes in someone,

116
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,750
nothing seems to
shake her faith.

117
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,375
[VAN] You shouldn't
be here, Hitomi.

118
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,708
[HITOMI] Oh, don't worry,
it's not a trap or anything.

119
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,208
[VAN]
What do you mean?

120
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,291
[HITOMI] That guy said the
message came from Ruhm, right?

121
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,125
Do you think Folken's
so cowardly that he'd

122
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,416
even turn your own
friends against you?

123
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,583
Once you see him,
everything'll make sense.

124
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:02,166
Quit yelling into my ear!
I heard you.

125
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,500
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,250
[VAN]
I'll keep my word.

127

[HITOMI gasps]

128
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,125
[VAN]
You'll be protected.

129
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,208
Whether I have to bring
you back to Allen,

130
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,166
or return you to
the Mystic Moon.

131
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,125
Either way, I'll make
sure you're safe.

132
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,166
[SORCERER A]
The shadows of the dragon

133
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,541
and the girl from the Mystic
Moon have overlapped.

134
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,958
I detect no irregularities
in fate density, though.

135
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,458
[DORNKIRK]
Folken's plan is still working.

136
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:38,291
All is proceeding as it should.
There is no need to fear.

137
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,458
Our new future is close
enough to touch,

138
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,250
and it looks glorious indeed.

139
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,083
[GETIN]
The Vione has been destroyed,

140
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,000
and Folken is missing.

141
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,791
[ADELPHOS] And those upstarts in
Asturia are now turning on us,

142
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,041
along with their allies.

143
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,583
They've threatened
us with sanctions!

144
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,708
Yet the emperor still
doesn't seem inclined

145
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:57,875
to make the slightest move!

146
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,416
What is he waiting for?!

147
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,500
That alliance is powerless.
It's nothing but a mindless mob.

148
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,083
I believe he's done nothing
because he has far more faith

149
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:10,000
in us, his four generals,
than any band of common rebels.

150
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,416
I wish I could believe that.

151
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,791
[GETIN]
What's wrong?

152
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:05,833
[ADELPHOS]
Hm?

153
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,375
You look pale.
Are you troubled?

154
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,958
[ADELPHOS grunts]

155
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,916
[ADELPHOS]
I cannot understand it.

156
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,708
What's happening to Zaibach?

157
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,958
[RUHM]
Do you think he'll come?

158
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:09,666
Yes, of course.
He is my brother.

159
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,875
This seems like an
awful lot of trouble

160
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,125
to go to for a family reunion.

161
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,083
Uh! There he is!

162
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,958
Hello, Brother.

163
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:45,875
[FOLKEN] She's quite the unknown
element. I find her intriguing.

164
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:55,416
[HITOMI]
Uh.

165
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,833
Hi, little lady!

166
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,250
I had a feeling you might
be tagging along with Van.

167
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,458
[HITOMI]
Uh.

168
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,208
[RUHM] I don't blame you
for being concerned,

169
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,708
but I wouldn't put yourself
in the middle of this mess.

170
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:09,541
I'm staying out of it, too. Van,
Folken, I'll see you boys later.

171
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,958
[FOLKEN]
Thank you, Ruhm.

172

[VAN]
Did you come alone?

173
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,416
[FOLKEN] Do you think I'd try
to entrap my own brother?

174
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,416

Van!

Look!

Look at what happened to
the homeland you abandoned!

180
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:32,083
This once lush, protected
land now lies in ruins!

181
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,291
Do you hate me, then?

182
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,625
A man who shares name
and blood with you?

183
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,166
[VAN]
Your crimes were brutal.

184
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,750
Your punishment
will be the same!

185
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,125

wandering freely?

[FOLKEN]
Yes.

212

To become Fanelia's king,
one must slay a dragon,

213

Awaken,

young nobleman of the

[FOLKEN]
Who's there?

224
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,500
[DORNKIRK]
My name is Dornkirk.

225
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,958
I am the man who intends to
master the power of Atlantis

226

and use it to control destiny.

What do you mean,
"the power of Atlantis"?

228

[DORNKIRK] The power that
flows through your veins.

229
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,666
You escaped death because the
strength of ancient Atlantis

230
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,750
is in your blood.
Join me and together

231
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:32,791
we'll create a world free
from the sorrow of war.

[FOLKEN]
Under Dornkirk's tutelage,

236
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,291
I learned the ways of science,

237
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,000
and used my heightened skills

238
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,333
to become a Sorcerer
of the Zaibach Empire.

239

I did it to ensure
Gaea's future.

You are correct.

Which is precisely why we must
change the fate of man now.

After all the sacrifices
that have been made,

we must bring peace to Gaea!

How will you do that?

276
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,833
[FOLKEN] Dornkirk's
theories were correct.

277
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,041
I'll learn the laws of destiny,

and bend them to make
the world a better place.

It's been done before,

and fear have great power.

That's what drew
the dragons to you.

Just as a drop of water causes
ripples to appear in a pond,

if you have anger
and fear in your heart,

conflict will follow.

free of that poisonous
rage and terror.

slew the ferocious dragon,

and became king of

kill the dragon, Brother?

You're right, Van.

312
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:57,625
Killing dragons is mean.
I don't care for it, either.

313

[FOLKEN] The king of
Fanelia is destined to fight,

you that awful fate.

burden, least of all my brother.

00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,375
So I have fought for years
to change the world.

317
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:15,041
To make it a peaceful place
worthy of your peaceful soul.

318
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,458
However...

319
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:21,750
Dornkirk's methods,
no, our methods,

320
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,125
disrespected human life.

321
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,416
That, I cannot abide.

322
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:37,208
Van. This man must be stopped.
Please, fight with me.

323
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:41,083
Your wings, Brother.
What happened to them?

324
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,000
[HITOMI] So, in the ruins
of their homeland,

325
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,458
the brothers were
finally reunited.

326
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:51,125
But, where Van's wings
were white as snow,

327
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:55,416
the feathers that flew from
Folken's were black as night.

328
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,375
[NARRATOR]
Escaflowne.

329
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,750
[ALLEN] There's something
important that I must tell you.

330
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,791
[VAN yells]

331
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,458
[ALLEN]
Now that you know everything,

332
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,791
can you possibly love me?

333
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,625
[DILANDAU]
Burn away!
