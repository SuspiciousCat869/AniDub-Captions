1
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:08,250
[DILANDAU] Shesta! Have you
located the dragon yet?

2
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,541
[SHESTA] No, sir. There
hasn't been any sign of it.

3
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,208
Most of the enemy's Melef
units have been wiped out.

4
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,208
We now control
the castle grounds.

5
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,500
Something strange
is going on here.

6
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,416
They're not putting up
nearly enough resistance.

7
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,708
And there's no sign
of the dragon, either.

8
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,750
Something's not right.

9
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,291
[SHESTA] We're preparing to
enter the castle itself.

10
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,458
[DILANDAU]
Don't, Shesta.

11
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,750
We're going to hold
position right here.

12
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,000
[SHESTA]
But, sir!

13
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,083
Don't make me repeat myself.

14
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:38,166
We stay in place and wait for
the dragon to make its move.

15
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,625
Lord Folken, sir.

16
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,083
The Dragonslayers appear to
be holding their position.

17
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:45,583
So, he's using caution.
A nice change.

18
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,708
I sense something off here, too.

19
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,166
It can't be this easy
to steal a secret treasure

20
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,083
that's been passed down
since time immemorial.

21
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,875
[ZAIBACH SOLDIER 13A]
There's still one left.

22
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:18,166
Freid has safeguarded its
treasure for generations.

23
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,666
We will not relinquish it now.
Farewell, Prince Chid.

24
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,458
May you grow to be a wise ruler.

25
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,833
[ZAIBACH SOLDIERS screaming]

26
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,000
What? What's happening?

27
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,291
This was your plan from
the beginning, wasn't it?

28
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,125
Lure us in and bring the
roof down on our heads.

29
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,333
I have to admit: I'm impressed.

30
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:05,208
[chuckles] You sacrificed
that many troops to keep

31
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:09,875
your precious treasure safe?
Admirably pragmatic of you.

32
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,625
Well played, Freid.
This round goes to you.

33
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:16,666
[DILANDAU cackles]

34
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,250
[SHESTA]
Lord Dilandau!

35
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,791
The castle's burning.

36
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,791
There's almost nothing left.

37
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,958
[CHID]
Voris... All those men...

38
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:36,625
They sacrificed themselves.
They're all dead.

39
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,833
They gave their lives
so that we could escape.

40
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,791
[VORIS]
Wait, Fanelia! I need a word.

41
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,041
Voris? What do you want?

42
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,375
This is not easy for me
to do, but there is

43
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,500
a special favor I would ask of
you, on behalf of all of Freid.

44
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,875
You don't need to ask.

45
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,041
I'm on my way to defend
the castle gate now.

46
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,500
[VORIS]
We'll see to that ourselves.

47
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,791
Please, Your Majesty.

48
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:05,333
I beg you hear me out
and do as I ask.

49
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,708
[FREID]
Stop crying!

50
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,375
Rather than wasting
your time on tears,

51
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,291
look down at the castle.

52
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,083
Look at the place where
Voris and his men

53
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,583
gave their lives to protect you.

54
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,666
Those soldiers died
bravely, doing their duty.

55
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,916
And we who rule Freid
have a duty as well.

56
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,666
Those men don't want your tears
and we have no time for them.

57
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,208
[MILLERNA]
Allen...

58
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:43,125
I see how you look at Chid,
with such sad eyes.

59
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,958
He's your son.

60
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,166
Yours and Marlene's.

61
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,250
Chid is my son,
do you understand?

62
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,333
[MILLERNA] Chid and I are
the only ones who didn't know.

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,125
[HITOMI]
We're moving fast.

64
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,625
Soon it'll be out of sight.

65
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,333
[DORNKIRK]
Listen carefully, Folken.

66
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:11,875
Aberrations have appeared in my
Destiny Prognostication Engine.

67
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:15,333
What we seek lies to
the west of Godashim.

68
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,791
You must find it.

69
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,958
Do you understand, Strategos?

70
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,458
To the west of Godashim.

71
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,083
Fortona Temple!

72
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:26,458
[DORNKIRK] I have grown
so very weary of waiting.

73
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,666
I want to see our
ideal future realized.

74
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,541
Until that happens,
our work is not finished.

75
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,166
We make for Fortona.

76
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,958
The oldest temple
in all of Freid.

77
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,250
[FREID] We are about to
fight our final battle.

78
00:06:56,333 --> 00:07:00,250
The ancient treasure of Freid
must be protected at all costs.

79
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,375
Fortona Temple is
our last bastion.

80
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:07,833
I have come to ask you,
the Zegu Clan, for your aid.

81
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,500
We will need it in this
dark and desperate hour.

82
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,291
[KAJA]
We understand well.

83
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,500
Our clan has lived in
anticipation of this day.

84
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:19,208
Those who have died already
did not do so in vein.

85
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,250
It's our duty to guard the
treasure entrusted to Freid.

86
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,166
We do that duty willingly.

87
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,375
My Duke.

88
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,333
We return to you the
treasure sword of Freid,

89
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:33,416
which was given into our care
so very many years ago.

90
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,291
Come, Chid.

91
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:43,250
Young though you may be,
it is time for you to learn

92
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,916
the duty of those born
into Freid's royal house.

93
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,833
Huh?

94
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,958
[FREID]
Fanelia. Allen.

95
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,708
I would have you
hear this as well.

96
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,208
You who fight along side us.

97
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,541
[MERLE]
Meow. It's creepy in here.

98
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:15,125
[HITOMI] What is it about
this place? It's like...

99
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:18,208
...like I feel a
strange power here.

100
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,375
[gasps]

101
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,125
Whoa!

102
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,750
That looks like...

103
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,833
[FREID] This writing is
that of ancient Atlantis.

104
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,666
This is the secret
treasure of Freid,

105
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,666
which we have guarded
for countless years.

106
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,375
We protect the
power of Atlantis.

107
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:55,708
It's all set down here in this
ancient Atlantian writing.

108
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,541
The power of Atlantis!

109
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,000
What's wrong with you?

110
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:02,166
I can see it. I can see it all.

111
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,500
The people of
Atlantis were powerful.

112
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,750
They had absolute
dominion over the land,

113
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,833
the seas, and skies.

114
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,333
As time passed, they grew
prideful and arrogant.

115
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:15,208
They styled themselves as gods,
with dominion over all things.

116
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,583
[HITOMI] With their ability to
turn human will into energy,

117
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,041
they ruled absolutely.

118
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,083
However...

119
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,708
Hey!

120
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,083
Hitomi?

121
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,125
Atlantis was destroyed
by the same power

122
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,416
that had ruled it, collapsing
amid fire and smoke.

123
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,666
The survivors sealed that
power here beneath Fortona.

124
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,833
So fearful were they,
of it ever being used again.

125
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,083
Now, here we are today.

126
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,416
Whatever happens, we
must defend this sword,

127
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,750
the key to the
ancient Atlantian seal,

128
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:11,750
the duty of Freid's
royal house. And, Chid,

129
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:16,166
we must never allow the power of
Atlantis to be awakened again.

130
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,791
As my son, you share
this burden with me.

131
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,833
Are you ready to do your duty?

132
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,125
Yes. I am, Father.

133
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,666
[MERLE]
Hitomi?

134
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,875
What's he...?

138
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,958
Uh--

139
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,625
Hitomi? What's wrong?

140
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,166
Nothing, but Allen's
looking for you.

141
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,750
I had a pretty good feeling
I'd find you here.

142
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,000
You were right.

143
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,583
[HITOMI] You don't look
like you feel so good.

144
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,166
What were you doing just now?

145
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,000
I was trying that mind
trick you told me about.

146
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,333
Hey, you know, earlier...
I was outta line.

147
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,083
I shouldn't have pressured
you like that, I'm sorry.

148
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,416
I didn't stop to think
about how you might feel.

149
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,458
I can't stand to have
another vision like that!

150
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,958
No, I'm sorry, too. I guess
I was a little hysterical.

151
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,291
Let's just forget about it.

152
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,458
Anyway, like I said,

153
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,083
I was trying that
thing you showed me.

154
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,583
The trick you do
with the pendant.

155
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,416
You called it
"dowsing," didn't you?

156
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,375
[HITOMI]
Yeah, that's right.

157
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,000
I thought it sounded useful.

158
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,291
I like the idea of being

160
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,916
Maybe with dowsing,

161
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,416
I can control Escaflowne
in a different way:

162
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,458
by linking it to my thoughts.

163
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:13,291
Can you imagine how good
a pilot that would make me?

164
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,416
If I can get the hang
of this, I won't just

165
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,833
use Escaflowne, I'll
become it when I fight.

If they manage to
breach the third line,

I want you to prep the Crusade.

protect King Van.

[KAJA]
Please, Duke!

217
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,000
We need to fall back to
the temple and regroup.

218
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,250
It's clear to me now.

219
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,500
What?

220
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,500
The gods do not want
the power of Atlantis

221
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,583
to remain buried. They
want it to be revived.

222
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,625
I can see now that
it is their desire

223
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,166
for the people of Gaea
to undergo that trial.

224
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,083
They shall have their wish.

225
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,625
I will give the treasure
into Zaibach's hands.

226
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:45,875
Even so.

227
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,916
The power of Atlantis is
the power of human will.

228
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,666
The ancients may have
seen their world

229
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,208
destroyed by it.
But Gaea is not Atlantis.

230
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:58,250
We won't necessarily
meet the same fate.

231
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,541
Destiny is not
fixed, but something

232
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,500
that we can forge ourselves.

233
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,416
A bright future may yet await
us, and it is the children

who will lead the way.

235
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:13,125
So, Kaja. I leave the
future in younger hands.

236
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:16,541
It is for me to shoulder
the burden of the past.

237
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,333
I will die with it.

Look after Chid for me.

He must finish
what I have begun.

His path will be difficult,
but I know he will persevere.

00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,250
Something's not right
with the king.

319
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,833
He ain't comin' out of
Escaflowne for some reason.

320
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,041
--What?
--[HITOMI gasps]

321
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,625
[REEDEN] It hasn't moved
since he brought it

322
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:42,458
into the hangar. Not a twitch!
Boss, something's really wrong!

323
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:46,166
King Van, it's Merle.
Can you please say something?

324
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,625
King Van! Please!

325
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,708
[NARRATOR]
Escaflowne.

326
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,750
No!

327
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:17,958
[MERLE]
Hitomi, I don't want him to die!

328
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,833
I can still fight!
