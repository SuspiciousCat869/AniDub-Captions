1
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,875
[ADELPHOS]
The dragon is far too powerful.

2
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:20,708
Folken, did you
know this? Answer me!

3
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,666
Were you aware the dragon
would be our greatest obstacle,

4
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,666
that it would perhaps
even block the path

5
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,458
to Zaibach's
unification of Gaea?

6
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:31,416
Well, were you?

7
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,750
Emperor Dornkirk's destiny
machine has spoken.

8
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,541
The dragons shall
gather together

9
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:40,208
and descend upon us
with a vengeance.

10
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,291
[DORNKIRK]
Indeed.

11
00:02:57,041 --> 00:03:00,041
[DORNKIRK] If the pull between
the girl from the Mystic Moon

12
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,583
and the dragon
increases further,

13
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:07,000
it will only bring chaos
and doom upon our future.

14
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:11,166
To prevent such a terrible
fate from coming to pass.

15
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:16,708
We must do our best to
separate those two elements.

16
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,833
But surely we must do more than
separate them, Your Majesty!

17
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:23,458
This is true. I would recommend
launching a full-scale attack.

18
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,708
We have the power to crush
Escaflowne like an insect.

19
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,291
Then it will all be over.

20
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,500
Your Majesty, please! Give us
your authorization to attack!

21
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,833
[FOLKEN] The use of force
is not necessary.

22
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:34,875
[gasps]

23
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,916
[FOLKEN] Rather than
creating more turmoil,

24
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
we need only
apply another gravity

25
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,250
on the girl from
the Mystic Moon.

26
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,333
That will be far more effective.

27
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:47,291
[DORNKIRK] What do you mean,
"another gravity"?

28
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,708
Sire,

29
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:52,291
I speak of the power that draws
man and woman together.

30
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,250
Here is my plan.

31
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,833
[MEN]
Cheers!

32
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,458
Atta boy! Drink up!

33
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,916
[HITOMI] It's been three weeks
since we escaped from Zaibach.

34
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,458
And now we're here,
safely back in Asturia.

35
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,458
Luckily, it seems the
crew of the Crusade

36
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,708
had the same idea we did.

37
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:41,333
And so, we're all back together
now, but something's not right.

38
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,250
[MERLE]
Yay, King Van!

39
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,375
[HITOMI]
Huh?!

40
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,958
You're... what?

41
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:01,583
Really? You and Millerna
are getting married?

42
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:02,916
[DRYDEN]
I guess she finally realized

43
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,166
what a great catch I am.

44
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,750
Think about it for a second.

45
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:07,958
With our marriage,

46
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,041
we'll be adding my money
to Asturia's power,

47
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,833
Zaibach won't be
able to do anything

48
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,291
against that combination.

49
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,916
Besides, I happen to think
I'd make a good king.

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,750
Uh...

51
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,166
You wanna win a war?

52
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,083
It doesn't always
take brute strength.

53
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,791
Sometimes it's what's
up here that counts.

54
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:23,666
[VAN]
That's just it.

55
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,375
They don't care about winning.

56
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,208
What Zaibach wants is the
total destruction of Gaea.

57
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:33,166
Your becoming king won't
do anything to stop them.

58
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,416
Well, thanks for the support.

59
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,666
[ERIES]
The matter's settled.

60
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,791
They've been engaged and
now they'll be married.

61
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,666
Asturia's royal family
needs a successor.

62
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,083
Dryden's the logical choice.

63
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,333
Furthermore, we'll even
let bygones be bygones

64
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,666
with regard to your past crimes.

65
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,000
[VAN]
What crimes?

66
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,375
[ERIES] Allen's rebellion
against his own country.

67
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,916
As well as your recent
attack against Zaibach,

68
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,541
who happens to be one
of our closest allies.

69
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,125
Are you serious?

70
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:04,333
Our father was devastated by the
news that Millerna had left us.

71
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,500
So much so, that he
fell terribly ill.

72
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,166
You broke his heart

73
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,666
when you selfishly took
his daughter away.

74
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,041
I don't think that's fair.

75
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,791
[MILLERNA]
Stop, Eries.

76
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,250
That's enough. No need
to punish anybody.

77
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,916
Isn't there?

78
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,625
Millerna, you look-- Wow!

79
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,291
[ALLEN]
Princess Millerna,

80
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,916
please allow me to
congratulate you.

81
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,583
[MILLERNA] What do you
think about this one?

82
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,041
Or would a fancier dress
be more appropriate?

83
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,666
Something with a few
ruffles, perhaps?

84
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,208
Well, it isn't the dress
that matters so much.

85
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,291
It's the wedding
you're worried about.

86
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,708
[MILLERNA]
It's all right.

87
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,791
Dryden's rich,
smart, and handsome.

88
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,125
I know he'll make me happy.

89
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,083
What more could
I ask for in a man?

90
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,125
I'm really very excited.

91
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,041
[MILLERNA]
Allen!

92
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,833
You're lying!

93
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,125
I know you're just pretending!

94
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,125
How can you get
married to Dryden...

95
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,666
...when you really love Allen?

96
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,916
Don't you understand you're
being unfair to both of them?

97
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,666
[HITOMI] You can't just forget
about Allen, and you know it!

98
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,833
If you do this, you'll
regret it your whole life!

99
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,750
[HITOMI] But if Dryden and
Millerna really do get married,

100
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,041
then Allen will be free.

101
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,083
Why am I doing this?

102
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,875
[MILLERNA]
Don't be naïve.

103
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,791
You're right. I'm very sorry.

104
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,833
[MILLERNA]
Although, if you don't mind,

105
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,916
you could do a reading.

106
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,208
[HITOMI]
How come?

107
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,916
[MILLERNA]
I admit it, I'm having doubts.

108
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,875
Maybe I'm not doing
the right thing.

109
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,958
And when I look at
your expression,

110
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,583
it makes me question everything.

111
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,625
But, Millerna.

112
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:38,250
[MILLERNA] So if you would,
please do a reading for me.

113
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,541
Tell me what my future holds.

114
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,208
But I-- Well, I can't.

115
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,791
Because... well, I don't
have my cards with me.

116
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,500
I'll do it later.

117
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,500
[HITOMI
Wow.

118
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:04,666
That was so stupid.
I really screwed up!

119
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,416
When I heard Millerna
was marrying Dryden,

120
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,208
I thought all my romantic
problems were solved.

121
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,916
Then I went and told
her to choose Allen?

122
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,500
Never mind the fact
that I like him, too.

123
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:19,208
And to top it all off, I ran
away. What a jerk I am.

124
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,958
[VAN]
Hitomi?

125
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,291
Hey, what's the matter?

126
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,583

No.

131
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:43,875
If we don't act now,

132
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,000
the dragon and the girl
from the Mystic Moon

133
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,000
will draw closer together.

134
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,666
[FOLKEN]
Not to worry.

135
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,708
[DORNKIRK]
Hm?

136
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,125
[FOLKEN]
We're safe.

137
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,958
The dragon still lacks the
courage to cross the line.

138
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,208
[DORNKIRK]
I see. Are you certain?

I am.

140

[VAN]
So, what's wrong?

141
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,916
[HITOMI] I feel like
such a jerk sometimes.

142
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,125
I'm always butting into
other people's business.

I'm a bad person.

Ugh, sour!

00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,958
What are these things?

00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,750
They're called piscus.
Don't you feel better now?

that's exactly what's
gonna come to you.

149
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,208
[VAN] I don't like
seeing you depressed.

00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,291
At this crucial moment,
I feel blind.

160
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,166
[VAN]
Hey, Hitomi.

161
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,375
Whatever happens next, I wanna
know that you'll be with me.

162
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,416
Uh. What?

163
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,291
Van. What did you just say?

164
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:58,041
[VAN] I said, I want
you to be with me.

165
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,875
[HITOMI]
Uh...

166
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,166
[VAN]
I want you!

167
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,041
[gasps]

168
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,666
[VAN]
I mean, I want...

169
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,958
What're you--?

170
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,833
I want your power!

171
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,708
[SORCERER A]
Levels now falling.

172
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,083
[VAN] You and I can
destroy Zaibach together!

173
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:25,041
One power can defeat
them, and you have it.

174
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,416
You possess the full
power of Atlantis.

175
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,083
Just think of Escaflowne.

176
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,083
Imagine how much more amazing
it could be with that!

177
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:35,875
I can't do it without
you, Hitomi. Please.

178
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,875
Big jerk.

179
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,833
[SORCERER A] Check complete.
All systems green.

180
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,166
[SORCERER E]
Fate density levels stabilizing.

181
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,833
[DORNKIRK] Men, that was
an extremely close call.

182
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,666
Folken!

183
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,291
What is the status
of the operation?

184
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:14,166
[FOLKEN] Majesty, all
preparations are complete.

185
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,791
Hello, Father.

186
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,666
[ERIES]
This is unusual.

187
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,708
You've never prayed a day in
your life, and yet here you are.

188
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,625
In this sacred place.

189
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,291
[ERIES]
Let Millerna go.

190
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,916
I implore you.

191
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,958
She's finally found happiness.

192
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,958
Please don't stand
in the way of it.

193
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:58,166
I'm very relieved
to hear that from you.

194
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:02,000
If you say she's happy,
it must be true.

195
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,750
Dryden is the right man for her.

196
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,166
[ALLEN] If this marriage
was merely his way

197
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,875
of making a play for the throne,

198
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,958
then I would've dispatched
him a long time ago.

199
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,666
I know.

200
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,958
My mother always loved
this kind of flower.

201
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,791
As I recall, it means:
"One who cannot be forgotten."

202
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:45,125
Thank you, Princess.
I understand now.

203
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,708
[FOLKEN] The Fate Alteration
Engine is not yet perfected.

204
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,708
It still requires finessing.

205
00:14:56,791 --> 00:15:00,458
But I believe it will still be
able to influence one thing.

206
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,500
And that is the
vulnerable human heart.

207
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,208
Is that so? Can you elaborate?

208
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,416
[FOLKEN] We will insert
this gravity of "love"

209
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
into the girl from
the Mystic Moon,

210
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,041
redirecting the vector
of her heart's desire

211
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,458
towards someone
other than the dragon.

212
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,041
This will change our destiny.

213
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,958
Their stay with
us was fortunate.

214
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:23,166
It allowed me to gather
samples from both of them.

215
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I believe these hairs
should be sufficient.

216
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,041
I would like to proceed
with the plan,

217
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,083
if you will allow
me, Your Majesty.

218
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,541
[DORNKIRK]
Go on.

219
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,041
[FOLKEN]
In order to succeed,

220
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:39,500
one of you must be my
partner for this endeavor.

221
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,541
Yes, Lord Folken.
The honor would be ours.

222
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:46,041
Here, Naria, let's
flip a coin for it.

223
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,666
That sounds fair to me.

224
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,250
We'll find out who has
the stronger luck. You ready?

225
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,375
[MERLE]
Hm? When did it start raining?

226
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
[HITOMI yelps]

227
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,208
This probably won't stop soon.

228
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,750
[SORCERER A] T-minus-30 to
activation of Fate Accelerator.

229
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,625
[FOLKEN]
Are you ready, Eriya?

230
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:38,791
It's time to assume the mantles
of Allen Schezar and Hitomi.

231
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:42,541
[ERIYA] Yes, Lord Folken.
Oh, I mean, Allen.

232
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,375
[FOLKEN]
Mmm.

233
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,583
Very well, then.

234
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,500
T-minus-ten now.

235
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:51,041
[FOLKEN] The stage is set.
The cast, assembled.

236
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:54,875
It is time to redirect
the vector of her heart.

237
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,041
Beginning fate alteration.

238
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,333
[SORCERER A]
Alteration has begun!

239
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,416
[SORCERER B]
Alteration has begun!

240
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,250
Alteration has begun!

241
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,958
Hitomi.

242
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,583
Yes, Allen?

243
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,333
[DORNKIRK]
Look. It's turning.

244
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:25,291
The wheel is turning at last.

245
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:29,958
It moves with our fate.
Now it begins.

246
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,708
Focus all your feelings on me.

247
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,333
[ERIYA]
Yes, Allen.

248
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,916
[MILLERNA]
Allen!

249
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,458
Fate particles are accelerating.

250
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,541
[HITOMI]
Oh, great. Where am I?

251
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,916
It's so dark. I can hardly
see anything out here.

252
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,083
I've gotta get back soon.

253
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,875
[HITOMI]
But back to where? And to whom?

254
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:12,958
Do I even have a place
to go back to? Really?

255
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,583
[MERLE]
Where are you going, King Van?

256
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,625
I have to find Hitomi!

257
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:22,583
Oh, just let her go! You'll
be safer in here with us!

258
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,125
[HITOMI]
What am I even doing here?

259
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,791
When did I get used
to this weird life?

260
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,000
I don't understand.

261
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,166
This isn't how things
were supposed to go.

262
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:42,166
[HITOMI] When did these
people become my friends?

263
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,125
I shouldn't be here.

264
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,416
Amano, I miss you.

265
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,541
Allen, what--?

266
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,833
Target value achieved.

267
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:08,000
[DORNKIRK]
Show me the power of Atlantis.

268
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:13,458
The power to bend destiny
and draw one body to another.

269
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,333
Hitomi.

270
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,416
Tell me something.

271
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,416
Why, only when I'm with you,
is my heart at peace?

272
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,916
[HITOMI]
He reminds me so much of Amano.

273
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,375
His warmth, his strength.

274
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,500
[gasps]

275
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,708
Elemental particle
density dropping.

276
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,458
[FOLKEN] Free your mind
of worldly thoughts, Eriya.

277
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,625
Focus on me with all your heart.

278
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,791
Let no other images in.

279
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,875
[ERIYA] I'm sorry,
my lord. I can't do it.

280
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:05,208
I know it's hurting
you, keep trying.

281
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,125
You must do this.

282
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,583
Anything for you.

283
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,125
[ALLEN]
What's wrong?

284
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm so sorry.

285
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,500
It's just that--

286
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,916
Well, it's Millerna.

287
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,458
I know how she feels about you,
and I can't do this to her!

288
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:31,916
Yet my eyes can't
see anything but you.

289
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,916
Hitomi, you're the one.

290
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,250
[HITOMI]
Allen. I...

291
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,916
[SORCERER A] Fate Accelerator
particles have reached critical.

292
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,625
Uniting elements.

293
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,666
Hitomi.

294
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,250
Yes, Allen?

295
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,750
[DORNKIRK]
Ah! This is incredible!

296
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:21,041
It's working! Truly working!

297
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,666
Witness! A new
destiny has begun!

298
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:31,875
[DORNKIRK laughing]

299
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:10,791
[NARRATOR]
Escaflowne.

300
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:13,833
[HITOMI] I tried to switch out
one destiny for another!

301
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,875
[HITOMI]
Wait! Stop! Don't do this!
