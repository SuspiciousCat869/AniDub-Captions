1
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,333
[CESARIO SOLDIER A]
It was a rout.

2
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:02,125
We... we didn't stand a chance
against Zaibach's forces.

3
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:07,541
[CESARIO SOLDIER B]
Regardless, we must hold that

4
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,041
position until we
hear otherwise.

5
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,791
[CESARIO SOLDIER A]
Or at least until the alliance's

6
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,291
main force arrives.

7
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,916
[CESARIO SOLDIER B]
We soldiers of Cesario

8
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,625
will gladly lay down our lives.

9
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:20,041
But I fear even that won't
be enough in the end.

10
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,625
There are simply too few of us.

11
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,916
But if we had the aid
of the King of Fanelia,

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,375
pilot of the legendary
Ispano Guymelef,

13
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,750
surely it would help
boost our morale.

14
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,791
[BOTH] Your Majesty!
Please give us your aid!

15
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,041
Very well, then you have it.

16
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,916
I will gladly lead the frontline
in the battle that's to come.

17
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,125
[BOTH gasp]

18
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,791
[CESARIO SOLDIER A]
We thank you, King Van.

19
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,708
But I have a favor
to ask of you.

20
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,666
I want you to take my
friend to Asturia first.

21
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,000
[CESARIO SOLDIER A]
Very well, sir.

22
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,208
A ship will be
made ready at once.

23
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,500
Wait a second! I'll stay.

24
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,000
I might be able to help
you if you let me, Van.

25
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,916
I know that. But if you stayed,
I'd rely on you too much.

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,791
[gasps]

27
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,083
I won't use your power for war.

28
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,208
I've caused too much
damage already.

29
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,041
But, Van...

30
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,750
[ADELPHOS]
This is madness!

31
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,500
With such a large
and powerful army,

32
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,083
Why haven't we
received permission

33
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,541
to advance on the enemy?

34
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,166
Our army is 40,000
troops strong.

35
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,791
Anyone can see defeating
that alliance rabble

36
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,666
would be child's play!

37
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,291
What reason could
the emperor have

38
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,833
for not acting on our advantage?

39
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,375
[DORNKIRK]
Yes. I can see it clearly.

40
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,375
Fate is about to
deliver the girl

41
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,625
right into my waiting hands.

42
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:09,041
The Zone of Absolute
Fortune is approaching.

43
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:13,083
All is in motion.
We await only her arrival.

44
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,708
There is no turning back.

45
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,458
[ALLEN]
Rain...

46
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,750
[HITOMI huffs]

47
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,791
[ALLEN] There's something
melancholy about it.

48
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,916
Everything it touches
gets washed away.

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,750
Allen, um. We should talk.

50
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,041
All you ever wanted was
to escape from Gaea.

51
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,916
The only thing that could
bring you back to this world

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,250
was Van's love. A love
that you obviously return.

53
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,208
Uh...

54
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,250
[ALLEN]
I'm stunned, honestly.

55
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,625
This may be the first time
a woman's ever refused me.

56
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,791
I am sorry.

57
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,250
I hope you'll try not
to worry too much.

58
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:57,208
I'm sure Van will come back
from battle in one piece.

59
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,416
And with very good reason.

60
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,083
The most important person
in the world to him is here.

61
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,833
[DRYDEN]
This is pointless.

62
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,416
War has no justifiable purpose.

63
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,125
Nothing positive
ever comes of it.

64
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,333
All it does is ruin
lands and lives.

65
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,583
[MILLERNA]
Dryden?

66
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,916
We merchants see the world

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,208
as a bunch of goods
marked with price tags.

68
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,583
War destroys all those goods,
and the price is much too high.

69
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,083
What is the point of it?

70
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,375
What is the matter?

71
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,291
You don't seem
like yourself today.

72
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,291
No. I'm definitely not.

73
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,291
[gasps]

74
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,500
You're absolutely exquisite.

75
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,250
Even a goddess could
not help but envy you.

76
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,166
Are you all right?

77
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:52,500
[gasps]

78
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,958
[DRYDEN]
I've realized that I'm not yet

79
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,666
the sort of man you deserve.

80
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,333
[MILLERNA]
What are you saying?

81
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,291
[DRYDEN]
This war will be over soon.

82
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,833
It doesn't matter who 'wins' it.

83
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:08,500
The people who remain will still
have to rebuild their lives.

84
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,041
[MILLERNA gasps]

85
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,166
[DRYDEN] And I want to be by
their side to help with that.

86
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,333
Maybe there will be some
use for a man like me

87
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,250
in the post-war world.

88
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,916
I'll live and work
as a merchant,

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,583
among the survivors.

90
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,250
That seems to be
the most honest way

91
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,458
to earn your respect
and affection.

92
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,625
When you do come back,

93
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,083
I can't promise that
I'll be waiting.

94
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,083
Eventually, you will love me.

95
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,000
And that is because I am
deeply in love with you.

96
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,416
[FOLKEN] You're here because
you want to help Van?

97
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,750
[HITOMI] That's right,
but I need your help first.

98
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:01,666
Tell me how to create a pillar
of light so I can go to Zaibach.

99
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,583
I'll go find Emperor Dornkirk,
and I'll talk to him.

100
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:07,083
And ask that he stop
all this fighting!

101
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:10,291
I'm afraid that request
will fall upon deaf ears.

102
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,750
Besides, if you willingly
put yourself in harm's way,

103
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,625
that will make things
worse for Van.

104
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,708
[HITOMI]
Huh?

105
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,083
I believe the better solution

106
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,208
is for me to speak
with the emperor.

107
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,333
[gasps]

108
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:26,416
[FOLKEN] I'll put a wave in tune
with the Fate Alteration Engine.

109
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,541
That should be able to
direct the pillar of light.

110
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:33,125
It's why I recovered this
device from the Vione.

111
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:37,041
This is for me to settle,
and no one else.

112
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,125
Folken, are you sure?

113
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,791
[HITOMI]
What?

114
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,666
[HITOMI gasps]
Oh, no.

115
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,916
If he goes to see Dornkirk,
he'll definitely die!

116
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:06,375
[MILLERNA] Yes, He cared for
me the best way he knew how.

117
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:10,041
I had convinced myself he would
make me happy, eventually.

118
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:15,000
[MILLERNA] But...
That's who I've always been.

119
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,125
I just wanted someone
to make me happy.

120
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,708
But now, I know
that's not right.

121
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,166
My happiness isn't someone
else's responsibility.

122
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,083
Allen. You knew it the
entire time, didn't you?

123
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,583
[ALLEN]
Princess Millerna.

124
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,583
Please, I--

125
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,750
[MILLERNA]
No, don't say anything!

126
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,750
If I keep hearing kind
words from you.

127
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,208
I'll start to rely on you again.

128
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:44,375
I refuse to be a
burden to anyone.

129
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,958
Please don't worry.
I'll be fine.

130

[ALLEN]
Knight Caeli, Allen Schezar,

131
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,458
will now depart for battle.

132
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:58,083
I bid you goodbye,
Princess Millerna.

133
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,958
[MILLERNA]
May the sea dragon god, Jichia,

134
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,833
always watch over you,

135
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,083
and may good fortune
bestow blessings upon you

136
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,000
in the battle to come.

138
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,541
[DILANDAU]
Huh?

139
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,083
We've just been
ordered to accompany

140
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,791
the 32nd Division to Galfo.

141
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:28,041
So, I recommend that we
prepare to leave immediately.

142
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,666
Is that so?

143
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,625
It's been quite a while...

144
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,791
...since we've had
a great battle.

145
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,500
Sounds like fun,
don't you think?

146
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:43,666

[COMMANDER]
Use our ultimate weapon?

152
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,333
We have to!

153
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,041
At this rate, we won't make it
to the enemy's headquarters.

154
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,208
We'll just have to
blast our way through.

[COMMANDER] But sir, our allies
are on the battlefield as well!

I don't care!

157
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,000
We'll teach those
Zaibach bastards

158
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,583
a lesson they'll never forget!

I'm so scared, Hitomi!

gonna come back!

You have to believe in him.

Van's definitely coming back.

I have to help him!

is my task, not yours.

Don't go to Zaibach, Folken.

you're going to die there!

[HITOMI]
I'm telling you.

I saw something,
and it was horrible.

[FOLKEN]
You needn't worry about that.

much time left to live anyway.

[FOLKEN] The reaction of fortune
is rapidly shortening my life.

234
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,208
Look at my wings.

235
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,000
They are the proof of that.

236
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:28,625
That's why your wings are black?

237
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:32,041
Conspiring with Dornkirk was an
unforgivable transgression.

238
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,291
For that, I can only
pay with my life.

239
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,833
This is the fate that awaits me.

You can't do that!

241
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,791
If you die, Van's gonna
be all alone in the world.

242

He'll suffer even more!

I don't want that. I can't
stand seeing him in pain!

survive and succeed.

And he'll understand
the sacrifice I've made.

He, too, wants a better
future for the world.

But it just isn't right!

00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,083
I still have to try
and do something.

249
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,375
It doesn't have to end this way!

250

Where's the red Guymelef?
I don't see it anywhere.

[DORNKIRK] The time has
come to use the full power

of the Fate Alteration Engine.

257

My entire life's work has been
leading up to this one moment.

And thanks to you, it's here.

It's all coalescing,
just as my will has dictated.

260
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,541
Your will?

261
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:06,250
[DORNKIRK] Correct.
I guided fate, making certain

262
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,708
you would bring the girl from
the Mystic Moon directly to me.

263
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,125
And so here you are, Folken.

do you plan to keep

267
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,666
[DORNKIRK] I'm surprised you'd
ask such a foolish question.

268
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,291
By this time, you of all people

269
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,708
should well know
my true intentions.

270
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,000
Then by the same token,

271
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,000
you should know what
I've come here to do.

[FOLKEN] I understand.

This is the heart of
the fate alteration.

290
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:00,375
Where action and reaction
are at their most powerful.

00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,833
Pushing against each
other with equal strength.

But now the war will end.
At least I have done that much.

Watch the Zone of
