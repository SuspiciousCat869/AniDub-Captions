00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,041
[KIO]
Let us outta here!

00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,666
[TEO]
Yeah, what's the big idea?

00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:58,916
--[ALL shouting]
--Hey, jerk, let us out!

5
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,833
Okay. Quiet down,
you dogs! Shut up!

00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,166
[ALL shouting]

7
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,041
[REEDEN] Just see if we help
out when Zaibach attacks!

8
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,458
Your allies might
talk and act tough,

9
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,833
but as you're about to find
out, no one can stand up

10
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:14,583
to Plaktu's ability
to divine the truth.

11
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:31,833
[PRISON GUARD A]
Wait in here.

12
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,083
[HITOMI grunts]

13
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:50,416
Geez. Talk about spooky.

14
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,291
[gasps] Prince Chid?

15
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,000
Please, Your Highness,

16
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,875
you don't actually
believe it, do you?

17
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,583
That we're rebels seeking
to overthrow Asturia?

18
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,916
Look in my eyes, do I look
like I'm lying to you?

19
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,166
[CHID] Unfortunately,
I'm not entirely sure.

20
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,500
But Plaktu's magic
can differentiate

21
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,291
between lies and the truth.

22
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,125
Have some faith
in us, please.

23
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,750
[CHID] I wish I could, but
as prince of this kingdom,

24
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,208
I have to be certain.

25
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,458
Therefore I must follow
my family's tradition,

26
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:25,083
and that's to use Plaktu's
powers in matters such as this.

27
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,416
Please understand.

28
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,916
I have to do what's best
for my country and people.

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,500
I've heard something similar.

30
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:34,416
From King Van. You're
a lot alike, you know.

31
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,166
[ZONGI]
Let us begin.

32
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,208
[HITOMI gasps]

33
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,666
I have others to
interrogate after you.

34
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,541
[VAN] Why are you
starting with Hitomi?!

35
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,708
She's got nothing
to do with this!

36
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,458
What does it matter
who goes first?

37
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,583
If you and your allies have
truly done nothing wrong,

38
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,833
then your interrogations
will prove so.

39
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,500
You're wasting time on this

40
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,333
while Zaibach's
prepares to attack?

41
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,541
He's right, Voris. Please,
you have to believe us.

42
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,291
Everything we've said to you
is the truth, I swear it.

43
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,083
One of your fellow
countrymen told me

44
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,791
to treat anything you might
say to us as suspect.

45
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:07,875
[MILLERNA whimpers]

46
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:08,583
[ALLEN]
Hm?

47
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:09,833
Wait, what do you mean?

48
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,125
A messenger from Asturia
recently arrived here

49
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,458
with some urgent news.

50
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,750
According to him, the lot
of you are fugitives.

51
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:19,291
There's a price on your heads,
and one on Escaflowne as well.

52
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,416
Aston, you fool.

53
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,583
I can vouch for both Allen's
story and his honesty!

54
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,708
What he's saying is the truth!

55
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:30,875
I hope so.

56
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,666
Because we're
going to find out.

57
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,458
The truth is always revealed

58
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:39,125
when Plaktu conducts one
of his interrogations.

59
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,208
[ZONGI]
"Earth"?

60
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,125
That's the name of the
place from which you hail?

61
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,416
[HITOMI]
Yes.

62
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,416
[ZONGI]
And where is it located?

63
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,375
[HITOMI] It's very far away.
You call it the Mystic Moon.

64
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,458
Wait, did I hear
you correctly?

65
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,000
Do you mean to say
you hail from a land

66
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,541
that's on the actual
Mystic Moon?

67
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,750
Yes.

68
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,041
The girl's really from
that accursed place?

69
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,916
Truly, Aunt Millerna?

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,750
Yes, she is.

71
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,166
I have been informed that you
and your compatriots launched

72
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,750
a sneak attack against a
Zaibach floating fortress.

73
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:17,125
I was also told you managed
to destroy an Energist mine.

74
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:21,083
Are both of these
accusations true?

75
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,166
Well? Answer me!

76
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,791
Are they both true?

77
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:28,750
Yes.

78
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,250
[gasps]

79
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,583
This corroborates the claims
that the Asturian messenger

80
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,208
made against them,
Your Highness.

81
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,791
[MILLERNA] Hold on! At least
ask her why they did it!

82
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,708
I'm sure it was part of their
plot to overthrow Asturia!

83
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:44,375
It's exactly like the
Zaibach prisoner told us!

84
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,875
[ZONGI]
Tracking a flying fortress

85
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,125
is near impossible,

86
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,666
and the location of the
mine was well hidden,

87
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,750
so how did you find them?

88
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:54,041
By dowsing for them. With this.

89
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,916
[ZONGI]
"Dowsing"?

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,958
Using your mind.
To see what can't be seen.

91
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,500
[ZONGI] So that's
her mysterious power!

92
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,750
Does this also explain
how you were able to see

93
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,416
the invisible Guymelefs?

94
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,541
Yes.

95
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,750
Give me your pendant.

96
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,666
Hand it over to me right now.

[ZONGI]
Where am I?!

100
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,583
What have you
done? Answer me!

101
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,083
I've seen through
your disguise.

102
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,000
You're in your true form now.

103

[gasps]

104
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:48,875
My spell's been broken?
But... how did you do this?

105
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,750
Uh! Prince Chid,
what's happening?

106
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,500
Voris, do you know?

107
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,083
I, uh, do not,
Your Highness.

108
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:03,916
[ZONGI] Let me out!
Do it now or else!

109
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,125
[ZONGI]
What, but how?

110
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:22,375
[ZONGI gasps] Impossible.
How are you able to see that?

111
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,041
You're a murderer, Zongi.

112
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,166
[gasps]

113
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,291
Not just that, but a
Doppelganger, too.

114
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,333
You will wear many different
faces in your life,

115
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,291
but none of them will
ever be your own.

116
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,875
Our kind is destined to
live and die in battle

117
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,666
until the end of time.

118
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,333
E-Elder.

119
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,916
[ELDER A] Such is the fate
that our clan is cursed

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,083
to bear forever, my boy.

121
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:02,208
[gasps] Uh. Oh, no.

122
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,166
Brother!

123
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,166
[FOLKEN] You curse this
world, don't you?

124
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,041
And the life you've
been granted.

125
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,291
You loathe that you were
born to be a killer,

126
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:19,541
but only feel truly alive when
you're in the heat of battle.

127
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,583
If you want this to change,
come with me, Zongi.

128
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,708
I can break you from
the chains of fate

129
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,916
that have bound your
people for so long.

Please tell me how!

132
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:39,375
[ZONGI] So, you can
see right through me.

Very well.

Wh-What's going on?!

This is how the

will soon be extinguished.

In fact, it will happen
sooner than you can imagine.

You let me go!

No! No. This is some
kind of trickery!

00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,125
Oh, no, it's her heart!
It's not beating!

161
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,166
[CHID, VORIS gasp]

162
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,166
What happened
down there?! Hey!

163
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,916
[growls] What was that scream?

164
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,208
The prisoner died!

165
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,625
[ALL gasp]

166
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,458
I don't know how it happened,
but your friend is dead!

167
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,083
[VAN]
Uh!

168
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,583
What? No.

169
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,333
[CHID]
Allen! Allen!

170
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,958
Hitomi! She just died!

171
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,583
Please, Your Highness, you've
got to let us go see her!

172
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,041
Uh. But, I...

173
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,958
[VAN]
We don't have time to waste!

174
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:19,500
He's right!

175
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,583
[CHID gasps]

176
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,083
Uh! What are you doing?

177
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,291
[VORIS]
Your Highness!

178
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,416
And you call yourself a knight?

179
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,791
Open the door and
he won't get hurt.

180
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,041
[MILLERNA whimpers]

181
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,750
Everything is going to
be all right, Hitomi!

182
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,708
Just hold on, okay?

183
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,500
I'm going to make
you pay for this

184
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,625
if it's the last thing
I ever do, Schezar!

185
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:54,083
Perhaps, but for now I just
need you to clear the way.

186
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,958
[MILLERNA gasping]

187
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,291
[VAN panting]

188
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,833
[VAN]
Hitomi!

189
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,541
Don't die! Please, you've
gotta pull through!

190
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,833
I can't... get her
heart to beat!

191
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,041
So just like this, right?

192
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,791
[MILLERNA gasps]
Yes. Hands right there.

193
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,041
Then push in time with
your own heartbeat!

194
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,583
[VAN]
With my own...

195
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,500
[heart beating]

196
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,500
[VAN grunting]

197
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,291
Good! But much harder!

198
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,791
Quick!

199
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:39,208
[VAN] Come on, Hitomi!
Just take a breath!

200
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,750
Please!

201
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,500
[VAN grunting]

202
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,083
[VAN]
Beat! Damn it!

203
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,583
Keep going, King Van!

204
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,250
Please, Hitomi.
You have to make it!

205
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,250
She feels cold!

206
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,208
I refuse to let
you die, Hitomi!

207
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,791
[gasps]

208
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,208
[HITOMI coughs]

209
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:24,916
[VAN gasps]

210
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You saved her, Van!

211
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:30,083
[HITOMI coughing]

212
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,833
[VORIS]
Thank goodness she's alive.

213
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,083
PRISON GUARD A]
It's a miracle!

214
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,125
Welcome back!

215
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:40,250
I'm glad you made it! Seriously!

216
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,875
Hey, Merle.

217
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,208
Meow. Oh, so that's
where my nail file went.

218
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,541
[CHID gasps]

219
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:49,000
[PRISON GUARD A] All right,
on your feet, scum!

220
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,708
Oh.

221
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,666
[VAN]
Hitomi? What happened?

222
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,500
[ALLEN]
Uh?

223
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,958
[HITOMI whim

224
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,333
Pl-Plaktu.

225
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,791
He's an imposter,
and what's worse...

226
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,333
Yes, tell us.

227
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,750
He's going to die.

228
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,666
Not just soon, but, terribly.

229
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,541
No!

230
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:21,250
[ZONGI] She can see my past
and my future as well?

231
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,541
[ZONGI gasps]

232
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,791
[gasping]

233
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,541
Apparently, she's not
the only one seeing things.

234
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,500
Regardless, I must report
this to Lord Folken.

235
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,916
[CHID] He was a Zaibach spy?
This Plaktu impostor?

236
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,083
Yes. I saw it,
Highness!

237
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:47,416
The Doppelganger killed the
real Plaktu and took his shape.

238
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,916
He also killed Miguel,
the Zaibach prisoner.

239
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,083
And...

240
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:54,958
I saw how he'll die,
too. It's horrible!

241
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,000
[CHID] Where is
Plaktu now, Voris?

242
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,750
He's nowhere to be
found, my prince.

243
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,083
[VAN]
He's on the run!

244
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,416
We have to track him down
and stop him right away,

245
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,416
Your Highness! If we don't,
he'll tell Zaibach about Hitomi

246
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,083
and they'll attack
Freid to get her!

247
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,166
[VORIS]
Silence! Your Highness.

248
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,541
Until we get this sorted out,

249
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,333
I think we should ignore
anything they say!

250
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,375
That's enough!

251
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,416
[VORIS]
Uh!

252
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,916
[BOTH gasp]

253
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,666
Chid.

254
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:41,833
Very well.

255
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,291
[ALLEN] That is a kind
of bravery, you know.

256
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,416
Sometimes it can take
even more courage

257
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,041
to believe in someone
than to fight them.

258
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,416
You spared me?

259
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,750
Yes.

260
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,833
Because I want you to track
down the Zaibach spy

261
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,375
and bring him here to me.

262
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,416
Your Highness!

263
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,333
Have you taken leave
of your senses?

264
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:09,125
"One proves one's innocence
through one's deeds."

265
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,666
I'll take full responsibility,

266
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,083
but I am giving him a
chance to prove himself.

267
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,416
I have made my decision,
and it's final.

268
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,333
[gasps] Highness.

269
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,000
[ALLEN]
Well, then.

270
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,625
[ALL gasp]

271
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,708
His wounds haven't healed
yet, Prince Chid.

272
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,083
With your permission,
I'll go in his place.

273
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,625
And I would like to
come along, too.

274
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,416
[HITOMI]
I don't care

275
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,166
what kind of person
this Zongi is.

276
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,583
I can't let that
vision come true!

277
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,291
Do you see anything yet?

278
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,458
A tower, that way!

279
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,875
Right! [grunts]

280
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:56,875
[VORIS]
There is a chance

281
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,416
that they might very well
run away, Highness.

282
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,833
I'm not worried about that.

283
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:05,583
If Allen places his trust
in Van, then so do I.

284
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,625
Hold on, this girl came
from the Mystic Moon?

285
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:14,583
Yes.

286
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:15,833
Through the use of a pendant,

287
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,666
she has the ability
to see the unseen.

288
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,541
She also knows the
past and the future.

289
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:26,416
So she can see the invisible
and foretell the future, eh?

290
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,666
That explains it.

291
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,958
[DILANDAU]
How she knew then.

292
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,291
[DILANDAU]
And that time...

293
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,958
[DILANDAU]
And also when...

294
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:49,625
[DILANDAU]
So this is all her fault.

295
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:53,250
That girl's the one
responsible for this.

296
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,250
Uh!

297
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,916
[DILANDAU]
Job well done, Zongi.

298
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,625
I... humbly accept
your praise, lord.

299
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,083
How about you accept
this instead?

300
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:08,000
[ZONGI gasps]
I don't understand!

301
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,916
[DILANDAU]
You killed one of my best men.

302
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,083
Bu...! I was only
doing my duty!

303
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,791
He deserved a death
more honorable

304
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,750
than the one that you gave him.

305
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,583
Such tactics are the reason
I despise your kind.

306
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:22,166
[ZONGI]
No! Have mercy! Ah!

307
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,625
Is that it?

308
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:29,958
Yes! We need to hurry!

309
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,291
[ZONGI gasping]
Don't kill me!

310
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,416
[ZONGI screams]

311
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,083
[DILANDAU chuckles]

312
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,916
We won't make it!

313
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,666
[gasps, whimpers]

314
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,875
[HITOMI]
Help me Van! No!

315
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:51,333
Lord Folken, save me!

316
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,750
[HITOMI]
Don't! No!

317
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,291
[ZONGI gagging]

318
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,833
[screams]

319
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,083
Hitomi!

320
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,916
Escaflowne is here, too?

321
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,458
This night just got even
better! Shesta! Gatty!

322
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,208
[VAN] Come on, Hitmoni,
snap out of it!

323
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,250
[VAN growls]

324
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,208
[DILANDAU laughing]

325
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,916
[VAN] Those invisible
bastards are back!

326
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,916
Can you help me find them?

327
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,458
You...

328
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,916
You just concentrate, and
picture them in your mind.

329
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Uh! While we're
being fired upon?

330
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:37,958
Trust me on this. If anybody
can do it, you can.

331
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:50,625
Yes! Fire!
Take down Escaflowne!

332
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,833
Like I told you, Van, you
just have to concentrate.

333
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,208
And picture them in your mind.

334
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,958
Found 'em!

335
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,625
What?!

336
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,166
Damn you!

337
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,000
[VAN yells]

338
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,958
Uh! So she's here, too!

339
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:35,000
The girl responsible
for my disfigurement!

340
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,833
I've got them, my lord!

341
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,083
[VAN]
Got 'em!

342
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,125
Die, you bitch!

343
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,833
[VAN growling]
Just hold on!

344
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,500
[HITOMI gasps]

345
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,208
[DILANDAU]
That's it, girl!

346
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:06,416
You've gotten in my way
for the very last time!

347
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,625
[HITOMI whimpers]

348
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,125
[VAN growls]

349
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,333
[DILANDAU]
Get back here!

350
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,666
You cowards!

351
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,583
[CHID]
Just like Hitomi predicted?

352
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,458
[VAN] Exactly, and since
there was nothing left,

353
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,291
we lost the only proof that
Plaktu was an imposter.

354
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,291
No, that's where
you're mistaken.

355
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,625
During your absence,

356
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,625
more evidence supporting
your claims was uncovered.

357
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,458
[MILLERNA]
The real Plaktu was found.

358
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,416
Or his corpse to
be more accurate.

359
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,708
Seems a group of monks
stumbled upon him in the forest.

360
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,416
He was but a dried-out husk,

361
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,666
which is proof that a
Doppelganger killed him.

362
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,916
But I would still believe you
even if no proof was found.

363
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,250
Because you proved your
innocence through your deeds!

364
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,875
[HITOMI, VAN]
Uh.

365
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:03,833
Heh.

366
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,125
They sure did!

367
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:08,333
We have done you many
wrongs. Forgive us.

368
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:11,458
If it wasn't for you, Chid
wouldn't have been convinced.

369
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:12,625
You know, it's strange.

370
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,416
I just realized how
alike you two look.

371
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,833
Your eyes and hair
are the same color.

372
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,250
You could almost
pass as brothers.

373
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,166
[CHID]
Uh...

374
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,875
[gasps] My friends!

375
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,333
I was just given word that
the Duke has returned!

376
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,208
Father is back?!

377
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,375
[HITOMI]
Chid's father, huh?

378
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,750
I wonder what kind of man he is.

379
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:10,958
[NARRATOR]
Escaflowne.

380
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,208
Hey, I'll tell you what.

381
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:15,500
How would you like if I
did a reading for you?

382
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,083
[gasps]

383
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,541
A forbidden love...?
