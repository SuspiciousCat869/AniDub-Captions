1
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:53,333
[HITOMI] Was it all just a
dream? Or was it a vision?

2
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:57,750
No. Crazy as it seems,
it really happened.

3
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,458
It all began with
a tarot reading

4
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,750
on a seemingly normal day.

5
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:04,625
I asked the cards
if I would find love.

6
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,166
[COACH]
Ready!

7
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,250
[STUDENT A] Hey, Hitomi,
do a reading for me!

8
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,541
[HITOMI]
Maybe later!

9
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:39,375
You're killing me! Come on,
Hitomi! Where are you?

10
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,875
[YUKARI]
Hey, practice is starting!

11
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,500
[HITOMI]
I know! I know!

12
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,791
[COACH]
'Kay, next up!

13
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,166
[YUKARI]
Finally! There you are!

14
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,625
You're late.

15
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,583
Late, late, really late!

16
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,750
You know who gets yelled at

17
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,666
when someone shows up
late for practice?

18
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,916
The manager. That's me.

19
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,458
Try to keep that in mind
next time, would you?

20
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,000
I will. I'm sorry.

21
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,750
I got hung up
working on my paper.

22
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,125
[chuckles]

23
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,875
Uh. How late am I? Did I
miss the guys' time trials?

24
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,291
[YUKARI sighs]

25
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,125
You're hopeless, you know that?

26
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:25,333
Your knight in shining
gym shorts is up now.

27
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,000
Good luck, Amano.

28
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,791
[COACH]
Ready!

29
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,041
[gunshot]

30
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:55,416
Whoa! Ten point six-four!

31
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,833
Ah! He really is awesome!

32
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:02,708
Amano beat 11 seconds, can you
believe it? He's amazing!

33
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,416
[YUKARI giggles]

34
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,625
[COACH]
Okay. Girls' times are up next.

35
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,166
[FEMALE STUDENTS]
Yes, sir!

36
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,833
Ready? Hm?

37
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:19,750
[HITOMI yelps]

38
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,375
I can do it myself, thanks.

39
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,833
Get your butt out there.

40
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,708
Fine, I'm going.

41
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,750
All right.

42
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,375
Ready!

43
00:04:58,875 --> 00:04:59,833
[gunshot]

44
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,208
You can do it, Hitomi!

45
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:16,250
[HITOMI gasping]

46
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,166
[screams]

47
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,500
[HITOMI]
What's this?

48
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:45,208
It's hot. Why is it so hot?

49
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,416
[BALGUS]
Prince Van, are you ready?

50
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,875
Yes. Don't worry about me.

51
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,583
[BALGUS] It's the dragon
that should be worried.

52
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,708
I've no doubt that
you can slay it.

53
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,541
Try to forget your
brother's disgrace.

54
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,458
Enough, Balgus! Stop there!

55
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:14,541
I won't be defeated. I will
never show my back to an enemy.

56
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,083
[yelping]

57
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,750
[screams]

58
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,416
Amano? Wh-What's going on?

59
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,666
Where--?

60
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,916
[AMANO] Easy. You should
stay in bed for now.

61
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,333
[HITOMI]
I'm sorry.

62
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,291
[AMANO]
I'm just glad you weren't hurt.

63
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,708
That was some fall.

64
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,125
[HITOMI]
Yeah.

65
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,541
[AMANO] You know, your form
is pretty much perfect.

66
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:17,083
I can really tell how hard
you've been practicing.

67
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,833
I'm not that good.

68
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:22,458
I mean, I still haven't
managed to break 13 seconds.

69
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,458
I'm not nearly
as fast as you are.

70
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,458
I don't know how you do it.

71
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,083
For me, it's all in the way
you come off the blocks.

72
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,458
[HITOMI]
Huh?

73
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,291
You have to focus
everything you've got

74
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,375
and then launch
yourself forward.

75
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,166
Really? Is that what you do?

76
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,916
S'bout it.

77
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,833
Huh? Hey, that's a cool pendant.

78
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,875
Oh. Thanks, you like it?

79
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,458
It's a good luck charm.

80
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,750
I got it from my grandmother.

81
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,291
It's really neat.

82
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,833
When you swing it like this,
it acts like a pendulum clock,

83
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:59,500
completing one cycle a
second, never slowing down.

84
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,625
[AMANO]
Huh?

85
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,541
Think I could give it a try?

86
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,500
That's one.

87
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:16,833
Two. Three. Four. Five.

88
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,041
Six.

89
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:23,041
[BOTH]
Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.

90
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:26,958
And Eleven. And Twelve.
And Thirteen.

91
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:30,750
[HITOMI]
Fourteen. Fifteen. Sixteen.

92
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,375
--Seve--
--[AMANO] Kanzaki.

93
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,750
[AMANO]
I wanted to tell you.

94
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,166
You see, I...

95
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:44,875
[YUKARI]
Hitomi!

96
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:45,416
[gasps]

97
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,958
I brought y--

98
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,000
[HITOMI]
Yukari!

99
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,666
Come on, say something already!

100
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,000
You can't ignore me
forever, you know.

101
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,083
[YUKARI] I can let it
slide for a rice cake.

102
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,500
[HITOMI]
Huh?

103
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,541
[YUKARI] And some cheesecake,
and a bean-jam pancake,

104
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,208
and some peppermint ice cream.

105
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,708
You know what,

106
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,875
let's just say a different
dessert every day for a month.

107
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,250
I think that'll do it.

108
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,458
[HITOMI]
Cut me some slack.

109
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,375
I didn't collapse
on purpose, okay?

110
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,750
[YUKARI]
Oh, really?

111
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,875
You weren't hoping somebody
would rush to your side

112
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,416
compelled by your fragile
state to declare his love?

113
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,458
[HITOMI]
You're a jerk.

114
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:28,083
[YUKARI, HITOMI laughing]

115
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,583
[YUKARI]
Hitomi?

116
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,083
[HITOMI]
Yeah?

117
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,375
[YUKARI] Have you ever done
a reading for you and Amano?

118
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,416
[HITOMI]
Never.

119
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,958
[YUKARI]
Why not?

120
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:41,166
[HITOMI] Well. What if it told
me things wouldn't work out?

121
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,375
[YUKARI]
Oh.

122
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,708
Right.

123
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,583
What's wrong? You seem
upset about something.

124
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,125
[YUKARI]
The thing is.

125
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,375
I overheard some other students
talking about Amano before.

126
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,958
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:59,291
I'm really sorry, but I think
he's moving out of the country.

128
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,041
I don't know if he's even
going to the track meet

129
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,125
that's coming up.

130
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,541
So...

131
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,291
If you feel that
strongly about him...

132
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,541
...I think you should tell him.

133
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,416
See what he says.

134
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,125
I know you, you'll
regret it if you don't.

135
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,083
[HITOMI'S MOM]
Hitomi!

136
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:25,875
Where are you?
The bath's ready! Hitomi?

137
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,166
[HITOMI]
There it is. The Tower.

138
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,416
It can indicate distant
separation. It's true.

139
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,583
[HITOMI] Amano's moving
out of the country.

140
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,583
I'll never see him again.

141
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:49,250
[HITOMI]
The Dragon of Light? Courage?

142
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,958
[AMANO] I'm sorry I'm gonna
miss out on the meet,

143
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,583
but you guys are gonna kill it.

144
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,041
Make sure to tell me how
everybody does, okay?

145
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,041
I'll be waiting to hear.
I expect good news.

146
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,416
[STUDENT A]
We want updates, too.

147
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,791
Let us know when you get there.

148
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:03,666
[AMANO]
Sure.

149
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,583
[STUDENT B]
Don't forget us.

150
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:05,833
Even if you like
your new school.

151
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:06,708
[AMANO]
No way!

152
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:07,583
[STUDENT C]
Goodbye, Amano!

153
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,083
[STUDENT D]
Goodbye, Amano!

154
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:09,958
--[STUDENT E] Bye, buddy!
--[STUDENT F] Take care, Amano!

155
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,291
[STUDENT G]
Goodbye!

156
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,333
[HITOMI]
Amano, wait!

157
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:27,666
[HITOMI]
Amano.

158
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,208
I... I have a proposal to make.

159
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,208
[HITOMI]
I want you to time me.

160
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,916
My goal is to run
a hundred meters

161
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
before the pendant can
complete 13 cycles.

162
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,166
If I beat the
13 second barrier...

163
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,541
[AMANO]
Huh?

164
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,208
[HITOMI] I'd like you
to give me my first kiss.

165
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,666
Well, let's see what
you got, then.

166
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,291
[HITOMI]
I'll do my best!

167
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,208
Kanzaki! Are you
ready for this?!

168
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:26,416
Yes! I'm ready anytime you are.

169
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,416
Yukari.

170
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:46,208
[AMANO] Focus everything you've
got and launch yourself forward.

171
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,583
Ready!

172
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,250
Just focus everything
you've got.

173
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,791
Go!

174
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,000
Almost there. Come on.

175
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,041
Uh?

176
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,166
Just who the hell are you?

177
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,375
[HITOMI]
Huh?

178
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,833
What the--? Where--?

179
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:02,750
[AMANO]
Kanzaki!

180
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,875
[YUKARI]
Hitomi! Are you okay?

181
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,208
Say something.

182
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,375
That guy.

183
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,458
[YUKARI]
Huh?

184
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,750
I've seen him.

185
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,583
That guy was in my dream before.

186
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,291
Yeah? Who are you?

187
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,625
Creatures from the demon world!

188
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,958
No, we're not from the demon
world, whatever that means.

189
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,000
What's going on?

190
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,291
Why don't you tell
us who you are?

191
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:28,958
I'm Van of Fanelia.
Where... Where am I?

192
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,333
What now?

193
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,958
Hold on. How can understand
what this guy is saying?

194
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,041
[HITOMI]
Huh?

195
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,166
If I came here, then so can he.

196
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,416
[VAN]
You should get out of here!

197
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,625
A land dragon's coming!

198
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,083
A dragon?

199
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:49,166
Get moving now! Or do you want
to be a dragon's dinner?

200
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,083
[BOTH gasp]

201
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,583
[AMANO]
Hey, easy, man.

202
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,166
That same lightning.

203
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,750
Not again. What's
gonna show up now?

204
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,125
Hitomi?

205
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,000
[HITOMI] I don't feel good.
I think I might puke.

206
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,875
Here it comes.

207
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:35,125
[growls]

208
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,125
What the hell is that thing?

209
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,791
It's a monster.

210
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,041
[VAN]
Over here!

211
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,166
You were fighting me, remember?!

212
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,875
What's the matter?!
Aren't ya hungry?!

213
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,750
Well, come and get me!

214
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:12,125
[LAND DRAGON roaring]

215
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,958
Did that finish it?

216
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,708
[YUKARI screams]

217
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,333
Huh, so that's how it hunts.

218
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,250
It wounds its prey then
finishes it off later.

219
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,750
Get out of here!

220
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,875
[HITOMI] Right!
Come on you two. Let's go!

221
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:47,958
[AMANO]
Yeah!

222
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:53,250
[yelling]

223
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,375
[AMANO]
Hurry!

224
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
[yelps]

225
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,833
[HITOMI]
Yukari!

226
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,250
[YUKARI]
It's my ankle.

227
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,541
It looks like you twisted it.

228
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,000
Here. Get on.

229
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,750
[YUKARI]
Thank you.

230
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:12,375
Let's go!

231
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,500
[HITOMI]
Coming!

232
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,333
Come back!

233
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,375
You're not gonna get away!

234
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,125
We should be safe up here.

235
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,041
[VAN]
Hey! Over here!

236
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:05,791
[AMANO]
Come on!

237
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:06,791
[HITOMI]
Yeah!

238
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,833
[yelling]

239
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,916
It's no use.

240
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,250
Its scales are too tough
to cut with this sword.

241
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,458
Looks like that thing's
about to make a meal of him.

242
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:38,875
[gasps]

243
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:44,791
He's gonna die. I have
to do something quick.

244
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,333
What are you...? Kanzaki!

245
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,833
[HITOMI]
Above you! Look!

246
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,083
[VAN]
Now!

247
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,583
[yelling]

248
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,333
[yells]

249
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,916
[HITOMI]
Um...

250
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,916
That was intense. Are you okay?

251
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,375
I'm not so bad off that I need
a girl to worry about me.

252
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,208
Why're you still here, anyway?

253
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,083
Let me guess: you want a reward.

254
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,041
Fine, then. Come to my castle.

255
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,458
But you better not think this
makes you some kind of hero

256
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,875
or anything.

257
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:19,291
It's just an apology for
involving you in dragonslaying.

258
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,541
Wow, you're a major jerk!

259
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,791
I didn't help because
I wanted a reward.

260
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:30,041
I thought that dragon was
gonna kill you. That scared me.

261
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,916
I didn't want you to die, okay?

262
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,333
So I risked my life to save you.

263
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,375
I don't think a simple "thank
you" is really too much to ask.

264
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,000
I should have let that
stupid dragon eat you.

265
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:43,458
Saving your life was
obviously a waste of effort!

266
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:49,541
[crying]

267
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,083
What's the Energist doing?

268
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,541
What's happening?

269
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,791
[AMANO]
Kanzaki!

270
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,208
Kanzaki!

271
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,500
Help me, Amano!

272
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,291
Where's it taking me?!

273
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,458
Kanzaki!

274
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,916
They vanished.

275
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,500
[YUKARI]
Hitomi?

276
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,208
[YUKARI]
Hitomi!

277
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,541
I made it back.

278
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,458
Where are we?

279
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:31,000
That looks like...
that's the Earth.

280
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,708
If I'm looking at the Earth,
then where am I?

281
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:37,250
We're in a field not far
from the village of Arzas.

282
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,708
How... How did we get here?

283
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:54,958
[HITOMI] The card of separation
and the serpent of light.

284
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:59,291
I was beginning to understand
what they truly meant.

285
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:01,541
The Earth and the moon
hung bright in the sky

286
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:04,541
of the strange world
I'd found myself in.

287
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:08,458
Its name, I would come
to learn, was Gaea.

288
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:22,916
[NARRATOR]
Escaflowne.

289
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,083
Good. So the old texts
were right. I can work it.

290
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:30,041
[VAN yelling]

291
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:33,500
So that's it.
That's Escaflowne.
