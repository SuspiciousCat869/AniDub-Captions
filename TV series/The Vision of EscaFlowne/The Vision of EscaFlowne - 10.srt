1
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:51,375
[REEDEN] Man, it seems like
they've been in there forever.

2
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:52,166
[KIO]
Yeah, I know.

3
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,583
He'll be okay, though.

4
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:57,000
The boss is tough.
He ain't dyin' anytime soon.

5
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,791
You're right. He ain't.

6
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,541
Come on, Allen.

7
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,333
Allen's operation
went successfully.

8
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,125
So you're saying
that he's all right?

9
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,416
[MILLERNA]
Yes,

10
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,625
but he's still unconscious
from the anesthetic.

11
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,000
[HITOMI]
Millerna!

12
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:26,958
[VAN]
We're very lucky

13
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,041
Princess Millerna
was here to help.

14
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,416
[GADDES]
Yeah,

15
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,958
and her pressence guarantees
us a ticket into Freid.

16
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,291
[VAN]
How do you mean?

17
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,333
[GADDES] Because she has
family connections there.

18
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,208
Her older sister, Marlene,
was once married to its ruler.

19
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,666
[VAN]
Princess Marlene?

20
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,541
[GADDES] Yeah, she was the
eldest princess of Asturia.

21
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,541
She got sick and
died three years ago.

22
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,458
But... she left a
young son behind.

23
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:53,000
[VAN] The Prince of
the Duchy of Freid.

24
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,625
[VORIS] Announcing the arrival
of the third princess

25
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:09,000
of the Kingdom of Asturia,
Princess Millerna Sara Aston.

26
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,916
[CHID] You must be tired
from your long journey.

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,375
My father, the duke,
is on an inspection tour

28
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,708
of the realm right now,

29
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,500
so I welcome you in his place.

30
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:21,583
Prince Chid? I simply
can't believe my eyes.

31
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,375
Yes. It's me, Aunt Millerna.

32
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,291
I'm so glad you're here.

33
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,916
You've grown so much
since I saw you last.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,125
I almost didn't recognize you.

35
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,208
You were still little
more than a baby then.

36
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,208
So small I could
hold you in my arms.

37
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,916
[CHID]
Aunt Millerna?

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,208
I heard a rumor that a knight

39
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:42,166
accompanied you on your
journey: Allen Schezar?

40
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,541
Is that him just behind you?

41
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,916
Before she died,

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
mother told me many
exciting stories about him.

43
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:52,833
She said that Allen Schezar,
the greatest swordsman on Gaea,

44
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,541
called Asturia his home.

45
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:58,500
"The invincible knight."
"The gallant Guymelef pilot."

46
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,666
I always hoped to meet him.

47
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,083
[VORIS]
Your Highness.

48
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:05,416
If I may clarify for you,
this is his royal majesty,

49
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,791
Van Fanel, of the
Kingdom of Fanelia.

50
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,333
I was mistaken. I'm sorry.

51
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:16,125
Then let me please welcome you
to Freid, Van of Fanelia.

52
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,875
I want you to think of
my country as your own.

53
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:22,208
It's important that you feel
at home here, so please enjoy.

54
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:25,125
Thank you. I'm grateful
to have Freid's friendship.

55
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,791
It means a great deal.

56
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,416
So where is Allen Schezar
now, Aunt Millerna?

57
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:36,416
[DOCTOR A] I believe he's out
of danger. His pulse is steady.

58
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,625
He should regain
consciousness momentarily.

59
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,166
[MILLERNA]
Thank you.

60
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,500
[CHID] I can't believe Allen
Schezar could ever be defeated.

61
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,500
I should've known better.

62
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:50,833
Invincible knights only exist
in stories. They're not real.

63
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,916
I think Mother just wanted
to make me feel better

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,875
by telling me fairy tales,

65
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,375
because she didn't
wanna disappoint me.

66
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,041
You're awake!

67
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:08,083
[CREW chattering]

68
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:13,958
[ALLEN]
Hitomi. And Princess Millerna?

69
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,833
Oh, Allen.

70
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,791
I'd like you to meet Chid, the
Prince of the Duchy of Freid.

71
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,500
It's you.

72
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,375
[ALLEN] That ring. If you
have it, then that means...

73
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,375
Allen, It's such an
honor to meet you.

74
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:37,583
Are you feeling better now?

75
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,791
[ALLEN groaning]

76
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,791
Your Highness,
Zaibach is planning

77
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,708
an immediate attack
on your country.

78
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:48,125
Please, grant me one favor.
I must speak with the duke.

79
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,500
There is little
time to prepare.

80
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,125
You're all in grave danger!

81
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,083
[ALLEN coughing]

82
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,250
[HITOMI]
Take it easy.

83
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,750
[VAN]
Prince Chid,

84
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,625
Allen travelled
here to warn you,

85
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:01,458
and he put both his honor and
life at great risk to do it.

86
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,833
What your mother told
you was no fairy tale.

87
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,916
He really is the gallant
knight she said he was.

88
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,833
Thank you.

89
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,125
[VORIS] But we've had
no conflict with Zaibach.

90
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,125
Why would they
want to attack us?

91
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,041
[VAN] You're detaining
one of their soldiers.

92
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,500
If you interrogate him,
he'll probably confess.

93
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,125
Good, because we're already
making arrangements for that.

94
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,333
Oh, are you?

95
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,125
As you know, the duke is away,

96
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,416
so we must question
the prisoner.

97
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,958
And we must be
careful about it.

98
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,333
He's a slippery little eel.

99
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,500
[FOLKEN]
The dragon has fled to Freid.

100
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,666
[DILANDAU]
Hmph. What of it?

101
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,125
[FOLKEN]
Along with their prisoner.

102
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,291
[DILANDAU]
Don't worry about it.

103
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,791
Are you forgetting?
Miguel is one of my men.

104
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,125
He'd sooner die than
give anything away.

105
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,791
[FOLKEN]
That may be.

106
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,583
But Freid has the advantage
of Plaktu, you see.

107
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,875
[DILANDAU]
Who's that?

108
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,916
He is a high priest.

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,125
A true master of
hypnotic suggestion.

110
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,708
He can use his techniques
to extract information

111
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,541
from the furthest
recesses of the mind.

112
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,708
It's been confirmed

113
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,125
that he's already on
his way to Godashim.

114
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,000
And you tell me this now?!

115
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,958
We have to kill him before
he reaches the castle.

116
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,000
He'll discover our plans!

117
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,708
[FOLKEN]
Zongi.

118
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:14,958
[ZONGI]
Yes, Lord.

119
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,625
[DILANDAU]
Huh? What--?

120
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,125
Who said that?

121
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,583
[DILANDAU]
What's that horrible smell?

122
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,750
You summoned a Doppelganger?

123
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,833
[FOLKEN] Zongi, I have
a special task for you.

124
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,416
I am ready.

125
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,916
Tell me your wish, master, for
I wait on you, and you alone.

126
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,416
[MILLERNA]
Hitomi?

127
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,208
[HITOMI]
Oh, hi, Millerna.

128
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,333
Here's this. I thought you'd
like to have it with you.

129
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,375
That's my duffel bag.

130
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,625
[HITOMI] Thanks,
that's very nice of you.

131
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,458
But I'm surprised you
brought it, though.

132
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,416
How'd you know
you'd run into me?

133
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,000
[MILLERNA]
What can I say?

134
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,583
I had a feeling I'd be seeing
you again someday, I suppose.

135
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,416
It seems we'll be spending
quite a bit of time together.

136
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,625
We might as well
try to be friends.

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,250
Maybe it was
women's intuition.

138
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,791
[DILANDAU]
Their ship is in range.

139
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,625
One single shot, and I could
bring it down in flames.

140
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:25,208
[ZONGI] Lord Dilandau,
please use discretion.

141
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,125
[DILANDAU]
Mind your own business.

142
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,250
Using a Doppelganger.
That is so cheap.

143
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,333
Folken, this idea of
yours had better work.

144
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,166
[ALLEN]
Princess.

145
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,041
It was very reckless of you
to follow me like that.

146
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,166
[MILLERNA]
I had to.

147
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,041
I know you better
than you think I do.

148
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,125
You had another reason
for leaving Asturia

149
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,875
besides wanting to
save Freid, am I right?

150
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,083
You were worried that Zaibach

151
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,250
would eventually attack
Asturia as well,

152
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,083
and you wouldn't stand for that.

153
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,791
I know my father will come to
accept that choice someday.

154
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:27,833
He'll recognize that you love
Asturia more than anyone else.

155
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,458
[HITOMI]
Van, it's the crack of dawn.

156
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,875
What'd you wake me up
for at this crazy hour?

157
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,083
And Merle?

158
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,083
Great. Why are you here, too?

159
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:45,208
[MERLE] I don't like the idea of
you being alone with King Van.

160
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,166
[HITOMI]
Gimme a break.

161
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,416
[VAN] You're the only one
so far who's been able to spot

162
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,833
those invisible Guymelefs.

163
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,416
I'll never be able to see
them without that power--

164
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,875
Your power, I mean.

165
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,583
I'm gonna need it if
I'm going to fight them.

166
00:09:58,666 --> 00:09:59,916
So how do you do it?

167
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,041
How can you possibly
see an invisible enemy?

168
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,875
Well, I...

169
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,000
[PLAKTU]
An assassin.

170
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,125
You're awfully clever
entering this room

171
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,250
without my noticing you.

172
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,916
Now, get out!

173
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:35,333
[PLAKTU choking]

174
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,375
[ZONGI]
Yes. Excellent.

175
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,000
This body will work perfectly.

176
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,250
[HITOMI]
Picture what you're looking for

177
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,958
in your mind very clearly.

178
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,833
That's all there is to it.

179
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,416
When you sense what
you want to find,

180
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,791
the pendant will
follow your thought,

181
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,916
and it'll swing
in that direction.

182
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,416
With practice,

183
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,666
you can do it by just picturing
the pendant in your mind.

184
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,583
Okay, what should I look for?

185
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,875
Well, let's see.

186
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,958
Me, me, me.
Look for me, King Van!

187
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,000
I know you can find me!

188
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,125
All right, Merle it is.

189
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,458
What do you suppose
they're doing?

190
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,083
I don't know.

191
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:43,041
King Van is gonna find me
here for sure, any second!

192
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,250
[HITOMI]
Keep your eyes closed

193
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,750
and think hard about
what she looks like.

194
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:51,541
Clear a space in your mind,
and concentrate on her.

195
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:54,625
That's great,
now focus on her image.

196
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:59,125
Take all the time you need to.
Picture her long, crazy tail.

197
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,375
Also,

198
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,333
those big pointy ears,
that wild, curly hair.

199
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:07,416
Imagine those giant eyes,
that obnoxious personality.

200
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,916
That big, loud mouth of hers.

201
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,833
I'm gonna turn her skinny legs
into two scratching posts!

202
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,583
I give up. It isn't working.

203
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,708
[HITOMI]
I'm not letting you quit yet.

204
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,541
Anyone starting out
has some trouble,

205
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,416
but with a little practice,
it gets much easier.

206
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,125
Here, watch me.

207
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:40,416
There!

208
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,750
[MERLE yelps]

209
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,041
Yeah, right. Like I'm
gonna admit she found me.

210
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:44,875
[VAN]
Merle.

211
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,041
[squeals]

212
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,041
[MERLE] Hey, King Van!
You found me! Yay!

213
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,583
[VAN]
Uhh...

214
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,000
[HITOMI]
Prince Chid.

215
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,666
Well done! That was
just amazing, Hitomi!

216
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,875
I'm impressed!
How'd you do that?

217
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,291
[HITOMI]
Oh, uh, no big deal.

218
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,666
[MERLE]
No, Your Highness!

219
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,833
Don't you listen
to a word she says.

220
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,333
She's nothing but
a cheap fortune-teller.

221
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,583
In fact, I think it's creepy
how she goes snooping

222
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,041
into everyone's past and
future and stuff! Ooo!

223
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,416
Okay, knock it off, Merle!

224
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,166
[CHID]
Is that true?

225
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,666
Do you honestly know
how to tell the future?

226
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,041
I'm not sure how to explain it.

227
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:21,083
When I do readings, I see things
in my mind at the same time.

228
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,666
That's incredible.

229
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,000
Not even Plaktu can do that,
and he can do almost anything.

230
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:26,875
[HITOMI]
Oh?

231
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,583
Hey, Hitomi, do you think maybe

232
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,958
you'd be able to predict
my future for me?

233
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,916
Well, uh... I don't know.

234
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,083
Please, it would mean so much.

235
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,416
Then, I would be happy to.

236
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,375
[MESSENGER A]
Voris!

237
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:45,000
We've just received notice that
Plaktu has arrived at the port.

238
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,458
[VORIS]
Ah, excellent.

239
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,416
Your Highness,
Shall we proceed then?

240
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,750
[CHID]
Of course.

241
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:56,000
[CHID] Thank you for coming.
We're counting on your skills.

242
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,208
Leave everything to me.

243
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,666
[ZONGI]
Voris,

244
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,416
I must insist on having a few
moments alone with the prisoner.

245
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,625
[VORIS]
Uh. But why?

246
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,583
[ZONGI]
You must be Miguel.

247
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,708
Hold on. How do
you know my name?

248
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,333
[gasps]

249
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,666
Folken must've sent you.

250
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,708
[MILLERNA]
I brought you some dinner.

251
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,208
You have to eat if you want
to get your strength back.

252
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,625
[ALLEN]
Princess Millerna.

253
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes, Allen?

254
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,416
Would you please ask Hitomi
if she'll come up here?

255
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,750
What do you mean,
"a strange woman"?

256
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,000
You heard me.

257
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,541
My Guymelef was invisible,

258
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,625
but she pointed straight at me
as though she could see it.

259
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,041
[ZONGI]
Hmm...

260
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,333
Interesting.

261
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:53,083
Not to worry, I'll ensure
she's taken care of.

262
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,166
Are you gonna help me
get outta here now?

263
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,000
[ZONGI]
No.

264
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:00,041
I have a special job
for you to do.

265
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,125
[ZONGI]
Voris.

266
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,958
Uh. I... What just happened?

267
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,208
The prisoner is
ready for you now.

268
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,583
[VORIS]
Uh. Ah.

269
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:15,541
[CHID]
Plaktu.

270
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,458
[VORIS]
Huh? Your Highness.

271
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,833
I would like to observe
the interrogation.

272
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,958
[ZONGI]
He's already under hypnosis.

273
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,583
You may make your inquiries.

274
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,041
Very well.

275
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:31,125
Now then, young Zaibach.
I would like to know your name.

276
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,625
My name's Miguel.
Miguel Lavariel, to be exact.

277
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,541
And why were you sneaking
around on our border?

278
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,875
I was tracking
down a lone rebel.

279
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,208
Asturia requested me to do it.

280
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,958
A rebel, eh?
And who might that be?

281
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:48,916
A clever knight. Who plotted
to overthrow Asturia.

282
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,041
With the help of Fanelia's king.

283
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:55,000
His name... is Allen Schezar.

284
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,916
You can't mean that.

285
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,375
No. I don't believe it.

286
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,375
You're lying! I'll skin
you like a snake!

287
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,708
I'm telling you the truth.

288
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,375
[VORIS]
Then tell me this,

289
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,500
why did Allen
turn you over to us?

290
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,916
He said if I abetted his plan,
then he'd spare my life.

291
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,833
[VORIS]
What?

292
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,083
[MIGUEL]
He claimed the deception

293
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:16,250
would cause a rift
between Asturia and Freid.

294
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,333
Then, he would take
advantage of that rift

295
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,250
in order to become
the king of Asturia.

296
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,583
He what? No. No, you're wrong!

297
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,125
[CHID]
It's a lie.

298
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:28,000
There's no way this
is true. It can't be.

299
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,083
It's a lie!

300
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,166
Are you serious?

301
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,416
Yes, I want a reading

302
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,666
for the Zaibach soldier
we've taken prisoner.

303
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,750
[MILLERNA]
Truly? You believe all that?

304
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,166
Please.

305
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,583
Okay, I'll do it.

306
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,083
Emergency stations! Dispatch
the entire Royal Guard!

307
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,875
And watch the prisoner.

308
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,166
[GUARDS]
Yes, sir!

309
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,125
[HITOMI]
Danger. Conflict.

310
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,000
This suggests tension.

311
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:56,958
And this is the
Warrior of Dragons.

312
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,166
It's hard to imagine
that's anyone but Van.

313
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,500
Oh, please.

314
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:01,750
Keep going.

315
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,791
[HITOMI]
World. Death.

316
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,875
A great power is guiding
everything towards an end,

317
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,291
so that it can all be reborn.

318
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:14,250
The end of everything. So
that's what Zaibach is after.

319
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,916
Let's read the prisoner.

320
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,541
The spare card?

321
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,125
I always take that one out
before I start, though.

322
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,333
I'm confused. It's blank.

323
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,000
[gasps] Not that!

324
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,708
[ARMORY GUARD]
Hm? Huh?

325
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:31,208
[MIGUEL]
Hello, girl. Ready to play?

326
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,333
Where are you going?

327
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:33,875
What's this about?

328
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,541
Well, just what is
the meaning of this?

329
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,583
Your Highness.

330
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:39,958
How could you?

331
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,875
I thought you were true
knight, but you betrayed us!

332
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,083
What're you saying?

333
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,916
That makes no sense.

334
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,916
Prince Chid.

335
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,166
Voris, the prisoner
has managed to escaped!

336
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,083
[VORIS]
What's that?

337
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,250
That's impossible!
The cards predicted this.

338
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,333
[GUARDS whispering]

339
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:04,083
Great, she's working. Looks
like her stealth cloak is, too.

340
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,083
[ZONGI]
What is that fool doing?

341
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:12,125
There's no sense to this.
He should make his escape.

342
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,333
What?

343
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,041
There! The Zaibach Guymelef!

344
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,958
No good, I'm too
low on pressure!

345
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,000
Keep coming.

346
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,125
It's gone!

347
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:42,458
You're not getting
away from me again!

348
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,583
What? How could
it just disappear?

349
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,750
[GUARD A]
Send out the Melef unit!

350
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,791
Where are you?
You won't get far.

351
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,666
Got'cha now, Van.

352
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,166
Without that girl's help,

353
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,750
he's unable to see anything
through this stealth cloak.

354
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,125
[VAN]
Where is he?

355
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,958
Where is that coward?

356
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,666
I may as well try.

357
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,125
What is he doing in there?

358
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,708
It doesn't matter.

359
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,625
If I kill him, then I can stay
in Lord Dilandau good graces

360
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,333
and he won't punish me
for getting captured.

361
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,125
[VAN]
Focus.

362
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,666
Concentrate on what
you're looking for.

363
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,166
[HITOMI]
If you focus hard enough,

364
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,083
you'll be able to see it.

365
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,541
[MIGUEL] If I pour all of my
liquid metal into one claw,

366
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,833
it ought to be enough.

367
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,916
I can take him out for good.

368
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,541
[VAN]
Please. I have to find it.

369
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,750
Where's the Zaibach Guymelef?

370
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:57,500
There!

371
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,000
Now die!

372
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,125
Oh, no. He saw me!

373
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,083
[yelling]

374
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,583
I've got you.

375
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,208
Hey! What're you doing?

376
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,625
They're... They're after me?

377
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,625
[GUARDS shouting]

378
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,583
[MIGUEL] I can't run.
I'm hurt too bad.

379
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,000
What now?

380
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:53,958
[ZONGI]
My apologies,

381
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:58,500
but my true identity needs
to remain entirely secret.

382
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,958
The power to see the unseen.

383
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,208
I must investigate.

384
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,833
Your Highness, this must
be some sort of mistake!

385
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,125
I promise, we're on your side!

386
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,125
Please, Prince Chid.

387
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,041
I've always respected you

388
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,125
because of everything
my mother said.

389
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,666
Sadly, the reality is different.

390
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,041
I don't know what to think.

391
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,125
Was she telling me the
truth about you, Allen,

392
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,166
or did she make it all up?

393
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,791
[ALLEN]
Prince Chid.

394
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,416
Can you tell me something?

395
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,041
Have you ever believed in
someone with your whole heart?

396
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,500
Just doing that is a kind
of bravery, you know.

397
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,458
Sometimes it can take even more
courage to believe in somebody

398
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,333
than to fight them.

399
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,833
Highness,

400
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,833
do you think that is a kind of
courage you're capable of?

401
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:49,416
[HITOMI] In that moment,
I realized something.

402
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,416
There was a bond between
Allen and Prince Chid.

403
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,541
A bond that seemed to run
very strong and very deep.

404
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,250
[NARRATOR]
Escaflowne.

405
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:13,583
You've gotten in my way
for the very last time!

406
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:17,625
[PRISON GUARD]
I don't know how it happened,

407
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,375
but your friend is dead!
