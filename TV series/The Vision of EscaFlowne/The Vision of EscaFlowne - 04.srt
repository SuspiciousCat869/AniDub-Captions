1
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:53,166
[HITOMI] Was it all just a
dream? Or was it a vision?

2
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,958
We are in an outlying area
of the Kingdom of Asturia.

3
00:01:57,041 --> 00:02:00,625
In a forest there, I met
a brave and dashing knight.

4
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:04,041
His name was Allen Schezar.

5
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,708
[HITOMI] After he defeated
Escaflowne with his Guymelef.

6
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,708
I was overcome by
a terrifying vision.

7
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,541
[VAN]
She's doing it again.

8
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,666
[ALLEN]
Hitomi! What's wrong?

9
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,041
You have to get away from here!

10
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:29,375
I mean it! Take everybody
and leave, right now!

11
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:33,000
The invisible enemy is
coming to attack you!

12
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,791
Perhaps you should
lie down for a bit.

13
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,125
Watching our duel seems
to have disturbed you.

14
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,750
No, that's not it!
You have to believe me!

15
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,666
If you don't, everything and
everyone is going to burn!

16
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,666
[HITOMI]
I'm not lying!

17
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,875
Please! I know what I saw!

18
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:55,291
The same invisible giants
that attacked Fanelia.

19
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,666
They're going to
burn this place down!

20
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,041
I-I saw it! Honest!

21
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,291
What's all this stuff
she's babbling about?

22
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,041
Jeez, That little lady's
givin' me the creeps.

23
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,500
Well, o'course she is.

24
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:10,291
She came to Gaea from the
Mystic Moon is what I hear.

25
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,125
And everyone and their
mother knows full well

26
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,625
that place is cursed.

27
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,791
Yeah, I've heard that, too!

28
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,125
Does that mean
something's gonna happen

29
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,083
to the castle?

30
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,583
[ALLEN]
Enough!

31
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,833
Soldiers of Asturia are not
afraid of old wives' tales!

32
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:27,875
I'm sorry. Please
forgive their rudeness.

33
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,583
You look tired

34
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,708
You need to get
some rest, Hitomi.

35
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,625
[TEO]
Boss!

36
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,291
--[TEO grunts]
--[HORSE whinnies]

37
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,541
[ALLEN]
What is it, Teo?

38
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,083
We just caught a
suspicious character

39
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,166
out in the forest.

40
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,083
Suspicious how?

41
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:48,125
[ORT] Wait, was the little
lady's prediction really true?

42
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,250
[KIO] Here we are, Boss!
We've got the prisoner!

43
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:55,833
[gasps]

44
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,541
That's Merle!

45
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,291
Merle.

46
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,125
[VAN]
Merle!

47
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,791
King Van!

48
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,375
[whimpers]

49
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,416
Help me!

50
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,916
Hold on.

51
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,041
You know this girl?

52
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:24,250
Yes. She's from Fanelia.

53
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,000
So, here you are!
I finally found you!

54
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,708
Tell me. How's Fanelia?

55
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,541
There's nothing left.

56
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:37,041
It's gone. Fanelia
is gone, King Van.

57
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:44,583
[sobs]

58
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:57,875
[MERLE sobs] All the Samurai at
the castle--they were killed.

59
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:01,708
And the survivors were
scattered like ashes.

60
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,625
[MERLE]
Everybody was gone.

61
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,708
There was nothing
left but ruins.

62
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:12,458
But I, I still hoped
you were alive somewhere.

63
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,375
And I've been looking
for you ever since.

64
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:20,708
Merle. I'm so glad
I didn't lose you.

65
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:27,708
[gasps] A fire?
What's happening?

66
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:31,541
It feels so hot. What's goi--

67
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:35,250
Hitomi? She has a fever.

68
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,208
Van. Bring that girl
and follow me.

69
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,500
[DORNKIRK]
Folken.

70
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:50,875
Take heed--the dragon
has almost disappeared.

71
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,375
The dragon?

72
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,958
[DORNKIRK] Yes, and the
distortion has begun

73
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,750
to appear in the image
of our ideal future.

74
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,833
If the dragon slips
through our fingers,

75
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,708
then there is no telling
how profound the impact

76
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,791
upon our future will be.

77
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:08,125
You must rectify the
situation, and quickly.

78
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,083
Capture the dragon!

79
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,333
[FOLKEN]
Yes, Majesty.

80
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,250
Where are you going?

81
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,791
To make preparations
for an attack, obviously.

82
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,083
We can move at once.
We know where the dragon is.

83
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,416
Yes, but Asturia is an ally.

84
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,875
[DILANDAU]
Oh, come now.

85
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,416
If we go through proper channels

86
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,291
and wait for the politicians
to act, our prey will escape.

87
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,500
[FOLKEN] Have you considered
the repercussions?

88
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,458
[DILANDAU sighs]
There's no need to worry.

89
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,333
We'll use those
stealth cloaks of yours.

90
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,375
Then there won't be
any evidence to prove

91
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,458
Zaibach was behind the
attack, now will there?

92
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,333
[FOLKEN]
Hmph.

93
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,541
[DILANDAU] I think you'll
like the souvenir

94
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,625
I'll bring back, Folken.

95
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,625
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to trouble you.

96
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,416
It's no trouble at all.

97
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,666
Besides, I think you'll
find my bedside manner

98
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,666
is more pleasant than
that of my soldiers.

99
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,708
[HITOMI]
The Earth.

100
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:24,583
My poor Mom. She
must be so worried.

101
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,541
Your mother, huh?

102
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,250
What about your mom?
What's she like?

103
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,000
I bet she's really
pretty, isn't she?

104
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,416
She was.

105
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,750
She passed away when I was
still very young, though.

106
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,250
[gasps] I shouldn't
have said anything.

107
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:46,833
No, it's okay. That
happened a long time ago.

108
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,583
You are right, though.

109
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,833
My mother-- She was
very beautiful.

110
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,791
[ALLEN]
She was a gentle woman.

111
00:07:56,875 --> 00:08:01,208
One who loved flowers.
And I had a sister

112
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,291
who was just as beautiful.

113
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,125
[ALLEN]
But, sadly,

114
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:20,416
one day, my sister was spirited
away. She just, vanished.

115
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:28,041
[ALLEN] After that, my mother
fell ill, consumed by her grief.

116
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,708
And then...

117
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,208
If my sister was
still alive somewhere,

118
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,708
she'd be about your age now.

119
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,333
Oh, really?

120
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,208
I don't know why I'm
telling you all this,

121
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:53,125
but I feel like I
can be open with you.

122
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,375
Allen...

123
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,625
[HITOMI] I just told Amano
how I felt, and now this?

124
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,958
Geez, am I really
that flaky about guys?

125
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,958
[whimpering]

126
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,875
[gasps]

127
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Is this what I think?

128
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,375
[gasps] Oh, hey.

129
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,875

130
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,750
Van!

131
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,125
[ALLEN]
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

132
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,375
I should go, too.
I have patrol duty.

133
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,458
Wait, Allen. Please!

134
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,458
Be careful. I know
my vision was real.

135
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:59,750
Whatever those things
are, they're coming.

136
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,583
If that is the case,
I'll protect you

137
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,333
and everybody else here.

138

[MOLE MAN snoring]

139
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,208
[yelps]

140
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:22,708
Oh, Your Majesty, to what
do I owe the pleasure?

141
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,125
Surely you didn't
come all the way down

142
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,916
to the dungeon just
to disturb my nap?

143
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,708
[VAN] You're one of the
forest people, so you must

144
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,458
have some glar leaves, right?

145
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,916
Huh? Why, yes, of course I do.

146
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,625
You know about these leaves, eh?

147
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,708
[VAN]
My brother told me about them.

148
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,875
According to him, they can
neutralize most poisons.

149
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,583
Come hold this bowl
for me, Mole Man!

150
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:48,333
Eh?

151
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,583
[VAN]
Hurry up!

152
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:54,208
Ugh. All right, no need
to get grouchy about it.

153
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,666
[GADDES] So you believe in
those old wives' tales, too.

154
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,416
Why do you say that?

155
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,208
[GADDES] These emergency combat
preparations, for one.

156
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,750
What that girl from
the Mystic Moon said

157
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,333
has you worried, doesn't it?

158
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,083
No, what has me worried
is that man, Dilandau,

159
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,958
and the look in his eyes.

160
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,666
[ALLEN]
There's darkness in him.

161
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,000
You can tell he's
thirsty for blood.

162
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,583
[GADDES]
You think they're gonna attack?

163
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,541
[REEDEN]
Would Zaibach really do that?

164
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,541
[ALLEN]
They came here for a reason.

165
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,583
They know Escaflowne is here.

166
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,208
If they come again,
it'll be to wipe us out.

167
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,083
[GADDES, REEDEN gasp]

168
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,458
[REEDEN]
They'd go that far?

169
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,291
[ALLEN]
I wouldn't put it past them.

170
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:49,333
No survivors means
no witnesses. Gaddes.

171
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,458
Sir?

172
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,416
I want the Crusade
prepped for flight.

173
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,583
Right! Come on, Reeden!

174
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,833
[REEDEN]
Yes, sir!

175
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:00,416
[ALLEN] When you attack,
Dilandau, we'll be ready.

176
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,333
[DILANDAU]
All units, hold position.

177
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:19,750
[DILANDAU chuckles]

178
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,875
It's time to end this
game of hide and seek.

179
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,166
No, King Van!

180
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,625
[gasps]

181
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:52,541
[MERLE] It's that girl
from the Mystic Moon.

182
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,041
[HITOMI] Why is she
looking at me like that?

183
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,875
[MERLE] She's got weird
hair and weird clothes.

184
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,375
What's her deal?

185
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,958
[HITOMI]
Those ears and that tail...

186
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:12,958
She's a cat, but a
girl, too. So strange!

187
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:16,083
She wouldn't be so bad
if she was nicer.

188
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,250
[MERLE gasps]

189
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:23,916
[MERLE] Why did I get a
bench while she got a bed?!

190
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,291
[MERLE growling]

191
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,708
[HITOMI]
She looks really ticked off!

192
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,000
[gasps]

193
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,916
[HITOMI]
Something's coming!

194
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,583
Uh?

195
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:36,625
[screams]

196
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,958
Whoa!

197
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,041
Oh, it's King Van!

198
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,583
Why'd you run off like that?

199
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,125
There are sick people
to care for, you know!

200
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:53,916
Uh. What's that?
Did you make it for me?

201
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,833
Thanks. That feels nice.

202
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,333
It's medicine?

203
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,666
That's what you were up to?

204
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,625
[giggles]

205
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,583
Huh?

206
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:15,083
[HITOMI shrieks] Hey! What the
heck do you think you're doing?

207
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,208
Ow!

208
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,666
[VAN]
Just hold still.

209
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,333
Some poison from a plant
got into your wound.

210
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,708
This ought to bring
down your fever.

211
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,333
Thanks.

212
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:27,791
[gasps]

213
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:28,875
[gasps]

214
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,125
They're here. They came,
just like I saw!

215
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,416
[CRUSADER 4E]
What the--?

216
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,916
[CRUSADER 4F gasps, screams]

217
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,375
[CRUSADERS shouting]

218
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,208
[CRUSADER 4G gasps]

219
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,708
[CRUSADER 4H]
Fire!

220
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,416
[gasps] So that's
the invisible enemy.

221
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,875
The curse of the Mystic
Moon! We're gonna die!

222
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,125
It's just Zaibach, you idiot!

223
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,833
I'm going out there
in Scherazade!

224
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,208
[GADDES]
Sir!

225
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:09,291
[CRUSADERS scream]

226
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:13,375
[yelling]

227
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:22,208
[DILANDAU chuckles] Come on!
I'm not even breaking a sweat!

228
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,958
[GATTY] Lord Dilandau!
We found a tunnel!

229
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,791
[DILANDAU]
All right! Follow it!

230
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,541
Smash everything to bits!

231
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:33,958
Set it on fire! And most
of all, smoke out Escaflowne!

232
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,666
Damn you, Zaibach.
You'll pay for this!

233
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,041
[KIO groaning]

234
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,416
[ALLEN]
Are you hurt, Kio?

235
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,375
[KIO]
Boss, I'm so sorry!

236
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,958
[ALLEN]
About what?

237
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,041
I wasn't able to stop the enemy
from getting into the tunnels!

238
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,333
We have no chance of
holding them off now.

239
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,791
[VAN]
Allen!

240
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:02,708
Where's Escaflowne?

241
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:03,791
It should be safe.

242
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,666
It's been loaded
into the Crusade.

243
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,666
What's the Crusade?

244
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,583
[ALLEN] The castle's
fallen. We're withdrawing.

245
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,791
What? You're running?

246
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:16,250
After what those animals
did to your men?

247
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,875
If I stay, it'll only mean
more lives will be lost!

248
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,208
[VAN]
And you call yourself a samurai.

249
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,791
Well, I won't run!

250
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:27,708
I'll never turn my back
on an enemy and run again!

251
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,791
I'll make them pay for
what they did to my people.

252
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,916
I'll fight them until I die!

253
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,708
Choosing to die isn't
brave, Van, it's selfish!

254
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,166
[gasps]

255
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,750
[ALLEN]
Look, you're Fanelia's king.

256
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:44,291
As long as she has you and a
people, Fanelia has a future.

257
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:48,000
Sometimes, retreating takes
more courage than fighting.

258
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:53,833
A samurai gives his life
so that others may live.

259
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,416
Never forget that.

260
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:03,416
[ALLEN] Kio, I'm transferring
headquarters to the Crusade.

261
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,458
Tell the men!

262
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,083
[KIO]
Understood, sir!

263
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,916
I'll never hand you or
Escaflowne over to Zaibach.

264
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,416
You have the word of
Allen Schezar on that.

265
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,500
[KATZ]
Get moving, guys!

266
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,833
[TEO]
Aye! Just one valve left!

267
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:31,875
[KATZ]
Hurry!

268
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,291
--[rumbling]
--[HITOMI, MERLE yelp]

269
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,583
Aw, don't worry.

270
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,250
This old cave can
hold up to anything.

271
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,958
[PYLE]
Okay, check! Ready over here!

272
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:39,708
[KIO]
Pressure?

273
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:40,625
[KATZ]
Climbing, sir!

274
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,458
[TEO]
Good!

275
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:43,708
Allen's not here!

276
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,333
Neither is King Van.
Where are those two?

277
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,958
They'll meet up with us soon.

278
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,583
Let's weigh anchor, men!

279
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,333
[TEO]
Aye-aye, weighing anchor!

280
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,000
Set sail!

281
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:12,666
[DILANDAU cackling]

282
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,125
Burn! Burn!

283
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,625
[FOLKEN]
You're a fool, Dilandau.

284
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,708
This plan's nothing
more than senseless

285
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,250
slaughter and destruction.

286
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,958
[DILANDAU] It's also the surest
way to destroy any evidence.

287
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,333
All we have to do now
is capture Escaflowne

288
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,291
once it's out in the open.

289
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,958
This Allen Schezar's
a brilliant commander.

290
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,375
Do you actually
believe he wouldn't

291
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,458
have an escape plan in place?

292
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,708
[DILANDAU]
What are you getting at?

293
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,458
[FOLKEN] The waterfall at
the cliff behind the castle.

294
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:44,208
They say that birds build
nests behind waterfalls.

295
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,458
To prevent them
from being attacked.

296
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,833
[gasps] Follow me
to the waterfall!

297
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:03,708
What are you doing?

298
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,208
Okay, Van, hold on tight.

299
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,750
What? No, wait!

300
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:09,625
[yelps]

301
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
[HITOMI, MERLE,
MOLE MAN yelping]

302
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,125
It's Allen!

303
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,375
Yay! King Van!

304
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,208
[GADDES]
Okay, unfurl the sails!

305
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,041
[KATZ]
Unfurling sails!

306
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,583
[DILANDAU] Not bad,
you provincial low lifes.

307
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,583
You still aren't going
to escape, though.

308
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,375
I'll just have
to shoot you down!

309
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,916
But we can't use
our stealth cloaks

310
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,666
while we're in flight mode.
They'll see our Guymelefs.

311
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,458
If anyone sees us, we'll
just kill them, you idiot!

312
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,750
[VAN]
Where are we headed?

313
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,583
To the capital of Asturia.

314
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,958
There's no way their floating
fortress can keep up with us.

315
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,083
Allen, behind us!

316
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,625
Impossible! Their
Guymelefs can fly?

317
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,000
They're fast!

318
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,208
They got above us?

319
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,000
Now die!

320
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,291
[screams]

321
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:24,083
[ALLEN] I'll make you pay for
all the men you've killed.

322
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:32,333
I am going to
crush you, Dilandau!

323
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,708
Go on and try,
Allen! Please do!

324
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,333
Allen! Above you!

325
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,541
[yelps]

326
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,333
We're hit and the
rudder's not responding!

327
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,666
We're surrounded!

328
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,666
What's happening?

329
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,666
King Van, help me!

330
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,625
[VAN] Everyone's in danger
because of Escaflowne.

331
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:01,583
[ALLEN] A samurai gives his
life so that others may live.

332
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:05,833
[grunts]

333
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,041
Van!

334
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,583
Van! What do you
think you're doing?

335
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,083
[GADDES]
Hey! Hold up!

336
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,375
Well...

337
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,541
[gasps]

338
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,958
[yells]

339
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,375
Escaflowne is capable
of transforming?

340
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,583
I see now.

341
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,666
That must be the dragon
Emperor Dornkirk's

342
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,166
been going on about
all this time!

343
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,458
This one's yours, Gatty!

344
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,541
[GATTY]
I'm on it!

345
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,500
That's it, chase me!

346
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,166
What? King Van's leaving?

347
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,375
[HITOMI]
He's trying to help us escape.

348
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:02,708
[BOTH yelp]

349
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:09,875
Damn it!

350
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,541
[ALLEN]
Van, don't get yourself killed.

351
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,916
[HITOMI]
Gaddes! Turn the ship around!

352
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,208
We have to try and save Van!

353
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,625
[GADDES]
We can't right now!

354
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:33,916
Our sail's hit and the
rudder's not responding.

355
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,708
[HITOMI]
Oh, no...

356
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,458
So we're just leaving?

357
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:46,666
[MERLE]
King Van!

358
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:51,208
All right! All I have to do
is catch a dragonwind.

359
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:54,625
Yeah! Caught it!

360
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,166
[cackling] I haven't done
any dragon hunting

361
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,500
in such a long time.

362
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:11,666
This ought to be
very entertaining!

363
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,000
[NARRATOR]
Escaflowne.

364
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,500
I should've killed
you the first time,

365
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,375
but better late than never!

366
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:34,958
[HITOMI]
Faster! I've gotta warn him!

367
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,875
You're... my brother.
