It's as if everything around me

of him. Why is that?

He's lost a lot of blood.

It sounds strange,

were made from
inside of his body.

But if you do find yourself

We're running out

Please tell us what you know!

143
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,166
According to the ancient text,

144
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,416
Ispano Guymelefs
curse their operators,

145
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,958
ultimately killing them.

00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,083
That can't be true.

147
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,583
The pilots all die?

148
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:18,791
How does that happen?

149
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,958
My research tells me
the Ispano Clan

150
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,750
inherited the knowledge
of the ancient Atlanteans.

151
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,500
Unlike other machines,
an Ispano Guymelef has only

152
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,666
one operator and that person
is bound to it by a blood pact.

153
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,125
They will remain the
pilot until their death.

154
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,458
I've even heard that, on
some occasions, the Guymelef

155
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,333
will take control
and fight on its own.

156
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,625
The blood pact makes
it so that if the Melef

157
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:43,416
is damaged and falls,
then so will its master.

158

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,791
Hitomi. I meant to tell you...

161
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,375
This happened because of me.

162
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,083
I showed Van how to do it!

163
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,333
Hitomi?

164
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:59,166
[DRYDEN] All you have to
do is repair Escaflowne.

165
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,666
[ALLEN] We lack the tools
for this repair job.

166
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,000
Well, let's see.

167
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,666
Ispano Guymelefs
have something...

168
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,166
[ALLEN]
What are you doing?

169
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,625
Relax, I just called them here.

170
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,000
[ALLEN]
Called who?

171
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,375
The Ispano Clan, the people
who built Escaflowne.

172
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,041
They'll be able to help.

173
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,791
Okay, that's remarkable!

174
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:51,916
Of course it is.

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,500
That's the Ispano
factory mothership!

176
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,250

Oh, gadiohl del ahstah.

Oh, zaideh kel dongerook.

Oh, dongerook!

Oh, Farnelia!

181
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,375
[ISPANO WORKERS]
Oh, Farnelia!

182
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,875
[ISPANO CHIEF 14A]
Ooh, Escaflowne.

183
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,583
[ISPANO WORKERS]
Ooh, Escaflowne.

184
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,708
Uh, what exactly are they doing?

185
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,833
Confirming that the Guymelef
is really Escaflowne.

186
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,625
[ISPANO CHIEF 14A]
Fifty million.

187
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,666
Fifty million? For what?

188
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,125
[ISPANO CHIEF 14A]
Escaflowne repair bill.

189
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,166
How many years of
work would that be?

190
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,541
Two thousand, maybe more!

191
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,375
[gasps] We don't have
that kind of cash!

192
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,166
[ISPANO CHIEF 14A]
You can't pay money,

193
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,583
then we leave now.

194
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:52,458
[gasps]

195
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,791
What do we do?

196
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:55,958
I'll cover the bill.

197
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,708
Young master, please
don't do this!

198
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,750
We could make a
trade for my convoy.

199
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,083
Well, what do ya say to that?

200
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,083
[CLERK 14A] Oh, young master,
please see reason!

201
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,333
It's taken five years
to accumulate that!

202
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:09,958
It must be worth at least
80 million! Maybe even more!

203
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,166
Lord Dryden!

204
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,666
We appreciate your assistance,

205
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,500
but I'm not sure that
we can repay you.

206
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,916
Heh. Royalty like yourself
shouldn't have to worry

207
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,375
about pinching pennies.

208
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,250
Anyway, it's not like you
can really stop me.

209
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,416
In the end, I'll do what I want.

210
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,958
[VAN groaning, screaming]

211
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,333
Come on, Van, stay strong!

212
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,625
Bring me some rope.
We have to tie him down!

213
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,625
[MERLE gasping]

214
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,041
Hold on a little bit
longer, Your Majesty!

215
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,666
[REEDEN]
Sir! Here's the rope you wanted!

216

Wow, he really feels it.

217
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,875
Every single thing
Escaflowne feels.

218
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,541
Can't believe he's
the real deal.

219
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,875
[HITOMI]
He'll be okay?

220
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,625
Don't worry too much.

221
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,958
Once Escaflowne is repaired, the
king's wounds will be healed.

222
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,750
He just has to survive the pain.

[HITOMI]
Merle! You have to stay strong!

227
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:28,875
Do it for Van! He'll be fine.
He's way too stubborn to die.

[VAN screaming]

229
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,458
It'll be okay.

00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:37,958
I know Van will survive!
Right? He will!

231
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,833
So this is the sacred
power of Atlantis?

I can see my dream!

My ideal future pulses like
the beating of a heart!

00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,791
[gasps] Wow, he's healed!

235

I... I was so worried!
I thought we'd lost you!

238

Sorry, Merle. I'm always
scaring you, huh?

239
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,250
Well, what do ya know?
My idea actually worked!

240
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,333
--[HITOMI] Hm?
--Ha-- Um...

241
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,958
[VAN]
I owe you my life.

242
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,708
How can I ever thank you?

243
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,083
Allen, I'm in your
debt yet again.

244
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,208
Oh, don't thank me.

245
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,000
You should thank
Hitomi and Dryden.

246

Uh--

247
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,333
I didn't do much.

00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,250
This girl is the one
who figured it all out.

249
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm grateful.

250
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:32,416
Van. You need to be
careful with Escaflowne.

251
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,333
No, I'm not sure you
should pilot it at all!

252
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,250
If Escaflowne takes
on damage again,

253
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,291
then you'll get hurt as well!

254
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,583
And if...

255
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,916
If it were to be destroyed,
then you'd... die.

256
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,958
I'm not going to let anything
hurt Escaflowne again!

257
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,291

after us already?

[HITOMI]
What does that mean?

00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,583
Maybe next time you run away,

269
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,666
you should pick a
better hiding spot.

Don't you have any Guymelefs?!

And what about what
the Ispano said?

They won't make
guarantees, remember?

279
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,125
So please, don't
pilot Escaflowne!

[grunts]

319
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,208
[DALLET]
Stop right there.

320
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,500
[gasps] What the hell?

321
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,833
[SHESTA] We won't let
you kill Lord Dilandau.

322
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:01,958
What?

323
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,333
Things will be much
better if you come

324
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,791
and join with us instead.

325
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,625
Join who?

326
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,041
[DALLET] Lord Dilandau
is our beloved patron.

327
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,750
[SHESTA] He gave us our
glorious Guymelefs.

328
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,791
[GATTY]
He gave us a second chance.

329
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:14,791
[VIOLE]
We won't let you kill...

330
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,458
No, but I just killed you.

331
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,125
[GUIMEL]
We won't let you murder the man.

332
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,750
You're all dead!

333
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:20,583
[GATTY]
Just let go.

334
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,791
Leave me alone! Stay away!

335
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:28,291
[SHESTA] Yes, come with us!
We will protect our lord!

336
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,250
I don't understand!
What happened to him?

337
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,708
Van.

338
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:10,375
[NARRATOR]
Escaflowne.

339
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:13,875
[HITOMI] I have to do
something, or Van may die!
