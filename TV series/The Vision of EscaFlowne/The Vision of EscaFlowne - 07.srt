We arrived in Palas,

where I met Princess Millerna.

While we were there Van
saw his brother, Folken.

00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,750
Strange, but...

00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,375
I can't seem to
shake the feeling

8
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:09,291
that my vision of Van's
attack has yet to come true.

9
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,416
This is Palas,
a beautiful city

the faint smell of sea salt.

With that kinda cash, I can
afford all the booze I want!

It's not difficult to see why

Zaibach would want
that Guymelef.

I do beg your pardon,
Your Majesty,

but it's safe to assume that
a beautiful Guymelef like this

will not go unnoticed
by Zaibach's forces.

So, what would you advise?

61
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,416
Perhaps it would be possible
to camouflage Escaflowne

00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,166
as one of our own
country's Guymelefs?

[KING ASTON]
Not a bad idea.

we will be fortunate

rub Asturia the wrong way.

You can't really expect
me to believe that.

164
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,583
As if you would just
hand over your brother.

165
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:31,250
You don't believe a man who
would destroy his own homeland?

[DILANDAU chuckles]

167
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,958
[KING'S AIDE A] Sire, we have
received a letter from Zaibach.

168
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:41,041
It would appear Escaflowne
has not escaped notice.

00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,500
[KING ASTON] We'll act as
if we don't know about it.

170
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,250
It's not as though handing
it over would benefit us.

171
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:50,125
I just wish I knew what was
so special about Escaflowne.

172
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,791
If we could figure
that out, perhaps

173

--they'd quit nagging us.
--[KING'S AIDE A] Indeed.

174
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:57,416
Speaking of nagging, Meiden
has been going on and on

175
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,916
about that strange girl
that Allen brought with him.

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,416
He's decided he wants
her at any cost.

177
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,041
[KING'S AIDE A]
He desires a commoner?

178
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,708
[KING ASTON laughs]
I know of a little secret.

179

[MOLE MAN laughs]
Thank you.

180
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,708
[KING ASTON]
My sources allege

181
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:14,291
that the girl hails
from the Mystic Moon.

182
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,583
But that's foolish.

183
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,333
I'm sure she's just
another country bumpkin.

Surely you can see that Millerna

It worries me.

193

I can't help but feel
that you're using her

resemble her more every day.

Perhaps it's natural that
you would be drawn to her,

be who you seek.

I'm only trying to do
what's best for my sister,

I simply couldn't bear
to see her suffer!

I can't just do nothing.
I'll tell King Van.

321
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,291
He would want to know.

322
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,375
Somebody, please! Help me!

323
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,750
[GECKO C laughs]
Scream all you want, girlie!

324
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,083
[GECKO A]
No one's coming!

325
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:41,291
In the water, not even a
Guymelef can touch us!

326
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,625
Oh, Allen...

327
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,375
Right, of course
no one's coming.

328
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,541
[KING ASTON] I assure you that
we're doing all that we can

329
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:55,291
to assist in the search, but
Asturia is a vast country.

330
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,208
You must understand that I
can't spare all of my soldiers

331
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,708
to find one Guymelef.

332
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:03,125
[FOLKEN] Fine, then let us
conduct the search for you.

333
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:06,291
We'll use our own manpower
to find Escaflowne.

334
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:09,916
[KING ASTON] Oh? You are
truly determined to find it.

335
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,833
I can't help but be curious.

336
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,250
What is it about this
particular Guymelef

337
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,791
that has you so fascinated?

338
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,041
That's not your concern.

339
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,625
--[knocking]
--What is it?

340
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:20,750
[MESSENGER A]
Lord Folken!

341
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,041
We've caught sight
of the dragon, sir!

342
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,125
[BOTH]
Hm?

343
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,666
We gotta catch 'em, King Van.
You have to go faster!

344
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,208
I owe Hitomi my life.
This time, I'll save her!

345
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,208
That way!

346
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,458
[MAN A]
Huh?

347
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,666
[MAN A screams]

348
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,958
[MESSENGER A] One of the
men took this shadowgraph.

349
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:58,291
Interesting... It would seem
as if our search is over.

350
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,208
We never thought to look
for a disguised Guymelef.

351
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,500
Prepare to send out the
garrisons immediately!

352
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,791
Sir!

353
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,250
[KING ASTON grunts]

354
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,666
I never imagined it might
already be here in Palas.

355
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,333
Lord Folken, it's time for you

356
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,000
to keep your end
of the peace treaty.

357
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,625
You have to protect my capital.

358
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,416
I want the aid of the
Zaibach army at once.

359
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,875
You are truly a fearsome
king, Your Majesty.

360
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,583
Wake up Dilandau immediately.

361
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,708
Um... About that, sir...

362
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,708
[DILANDAU laughing]

363
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,791
Van, you're all mine now.

364
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:35,500
[FOLKEN] I didn't know you were
such a light sleeper, Dilandau.

365
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,500
[DILANDAU] I'm certain
I must still be dreaming.

366
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,083
Van's come right to us.

367
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,166
Talk about a dream come true!

368
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,333
Careful, that's an urban area.

369
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,833
It's important that we
don't hurt any civilians.

370
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,583
I'll see what I can do.

371
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,500
[MERLE screams]

372
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,541
There! I see them!

373
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,583
[GECKO A]
A Guymelef?!

374
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,750
He followed us in the canals?!
Quick, dive under!

375
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,041
It's Allen!

376
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,541
Merle! You swim to the shore!

377
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,500
[inhales]

378
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,541
[MERLE screams]

379
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,375
Be careful!

380
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,666
--[GECKOS laughing]
--That'll stop him

381
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,791
in his tracks! It's
impossible for a Guymelef

382
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:26,916
to follow us under water!

383
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,791
--[GECKOS scream]
--What's going on?!

384
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,958
[HITOMI screams]

385
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,083
[MERLE]
Huh?

386
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,375
[squeals]

387
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,250
You didn't die!

388
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:42,041
[VAN coughs, pants]

389
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,958
[GECKOS scream, whimper]

390
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,208
Allen! You--

391
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,791
[GECKOS arguing]

392
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,375
[HITOMI]
Van?

393
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,958
Wait, Van's the
one who rescued me?

394
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,958
[GECKOS whimpering]

395
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,208
[MERLE laughs]

396
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,416
Yay!

397
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,625
[VAN]
Are you hurt at all?

398
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,708
--[HITOMI] Uh... No.
--[MERLE growls]

399
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,708
So... I should thank you.

400
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:16,750
[MERLE]
Come on!

401
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,125
What kind of idiot goes and

402
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,375
gets herself kidnapped
by those creeps?

403
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,916
[HITOMI] I didn't do it
on purpose or anything!

404
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,791
[DILANDAU]
I found him!

405
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:28,666
[VAN growls]

406
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,041
Van!

407
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,541
[VAN]
Damn!

408
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,750
Aw, don't run away!

409
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,916
Yes, burn!

410
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,291
[DILANDAU laughs]

411
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,541
[VILLAGERS screaming]

412
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:25,125
[HITOMI gasps]
The city... The city's on fire!

413
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:26,875
[VAN gasps]

414
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:31,708
[VILLAGERS continue screaming]

415
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,166
[DILANDAU laughs]

416
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,833
[DILANDAU]
There's nowhere left to run.

417
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:42,250
We have to stop!
Innocent people are dying!

418
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:45,083
As far as I'm concerned,
that's entirely your fault, Van.

419
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,333
[VAN growls]

420
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:49,291
[DILANDAU] The city is
burning because of you.

421
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:53,125
You started all of this when
you scarred my beautiful face.

422
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:54,875
Now die!

423
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,041
[VAN gasps]

424
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:01,333
What?!

425
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:12,208
[ALLEN]
Stop at once!

426
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:14,083
You've done enough damage here.

427
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:16,125
Stand down or answer to me.

428
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,125
Why are you always in my way?!

429
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:19,583
You'll pay for this.

430
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,416
[VAN]
Are you okay?

431
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,666
[HITOMI]
Yeah... I think so.

432
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:31,750
Goodbye for now, Allen.

433
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,375
Stay safe.

434
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:49,916
[NARRATOR]
Escaflowne.

435
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,291
[HITOMI gasps]

436
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:54,333
Well? Come on, talk to me.

437
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:58,875
[HITOMI]
The angel...

438
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:00,000
...it's you.
