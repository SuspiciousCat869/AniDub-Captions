1
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,125
[FOLKEN] I'm glad you're
back. Did it go well?

2
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:41,458
[NARIA] Yes. We
completed our training.

3
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,333
[ERIYA] Even more
successfully than we'd hoped.

4
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:47,291
[FOLKEN] Excellent.
I'm very proud of you.

5
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,875
Some Sorcerers came with us.

6
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,666
What do they want with the
flying fortress, my lord?

7
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,083
They've come for Dilandau.

8
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:56,000
They'll be taking
him back with them.

9
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:59,208
It seems they were in
quite a hurry to get away.

10
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,458
I don't know why,
but they hate me.

11
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,791
If they act like they hate you,

12
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,041
it must be to
disguise their envy.

13
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,541
I have nothing but contempt
for all Sorcerers.

14
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,083
Don't say such things.

15
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:12,250
You may not like them, but you
should always respect them.

16
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:16,625
After all, my girls,
I was once a Sorcerer.

17
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,791
[NARIA]
Forgive us! We didn't know.

18
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,791
[ERIYA]
Lord Folken.

19
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,583
We missed you terribly
while we were away.

20
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:27,291
[NARIA] We counted the days
until we would see you again.

21
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:31,208
I missed you both, too.
I'm very sorry.

22
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,708
And now I must ask
for your help.

23
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,041
Please, lend me your strength.

24
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,916
[NARIA]
Anything for you. Our bodies.

25
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,125
[ERIYA] And our souls,
belong to you, Lord Folken.

26
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:47,166
[DRYDEN] That was trickier
than I thought it would be.

27
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,583
It took me a while
to figure out

28
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,958
that it's written in the
language of the Mystic Moon.

29
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,958
The Mystic Moon.
Are you certain?

30
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,750
Please, young master!
Leave well enough alone.

31
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,833
Zaibach is keeping a close
eye on your every move!

32
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,291
Nothing good can come of this.

33
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,291
I think it's time you went home.

34
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,750
[CLERK]
Uh?

35
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,250
I've decided that
I'd like to see

36
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,250
the Mystic Valley for myself.

37
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,958
So, turn this ship around,
and take it back to Palas.

38
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,125
[CLERK gasps]

39
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,000
[CLERK] No, please!
I beg you not to go!

40
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,958
How will I explain
to your father?

41
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:20,291
I can't return without
you or any cargo!

42
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,708
I'll write a note
for you to give him.

43
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:26,666
He won't have a problem if I say
I'm with Princess Millerna.

44
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,666
I don't think
that's a good idea.

45
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,958
Don't argue with me. Besides,
Allen's coming, too.

46
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,791
And why should I be
a party to this?

47
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,958
Be honest with yourself.
What choice you got?

48
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,833
Your father ruthlessly abandoned
his home, his fortune,

49
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:45,500
and his family in search of
the fabled Mystic Valley.

50
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:50,416
Everyone in Asturia knows
your sad little story, even me.

51
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,625
[HITOMI] So that's where
Allen's father went.

52
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,625
[VAN]
Then I want to go, too.

53
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,583
The Mystic Valley is the
homeland of the Draconians.

54
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,708
I wanna see the place
my people came from,

55
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,333
the source of the blood
that flows through my veins.

56
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,958
To understand the bond between
that land and Escaflowne.

57
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,000
Well, I'll be damned.

58
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,958
So many of you people
seem to be connected

59
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,500
through the Mystic Valley.

60
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:18,125
I wonder if it's by design,
or if it's by destiny?

61
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:26,875
[DRYDEN] "Year of the Crystal
Northeast. Green, 12th moon.

62
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:30,458
I'm currently journeying towards
the dark continent of Asgard,

63
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,625
upon which no human
has set foot.

64
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,416
Yes, I am certain that's
where the Mystic Valley lies.

65
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,500
There, I will undoubtedly find
that which I've searched for

66
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:44,416
all these years. A power
that works miracles.

67
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,208
The incomparable power
of Atlantis itself."

68
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,125
[CREWMAN A]
Boss, the helm's not responding!

69
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,000
We're never gonna make it
through this crazy storm!

70
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,583
[CREWMAN B] Bad news, Captain!
The Energist isn't cooling down.

71
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,583
Damn it all! It's the blasted
curse of the Draconians!

72
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:06,500
We were fools to think we
could sail these waters.

73
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,041
Okay, boys! Turn us around now!

74
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,166
[CREWMEN]
Sir!

75
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,958
[LEON] I don't think so.
That wasn't our agreement.

76
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,041
This ship had better
not turn around.

77
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,125
I paid your fee, and I intend
to get my money's worth.

78
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,666
But the ship'll break apart!

79
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,166
If we go any further,
then we're all gonna die.

80
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,708
Come on, man, even
you can't be that crazy.

81
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,041
I paid enough to buy
your lives twice over.

82
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,125
So keep flying, Captain.

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,750
[LEON] Countless days
passed after that.

84
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:46,500
In my hazy stupor, all I
could think about was her.

85
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,166
Her voice. Her face.

86
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,875
Nothing else mattered
to me. And then...

87
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:57,375
Asgard loomed ahead
before my weary eyes.

88
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:01,791
The gods have guided me here.
This is my one true destiny.

89
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,875
I've traveled so far.
It must be.

90
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,541
His destiny?

91
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,875
[LEON]
A cruel twist of fate

92
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,166
led to that first
meeting in my youth.

93
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,916
Crueler still, our
sudden separation.

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,041
But what is she to me, truly?

95
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,791
I have journeyed
here to find that out.

96
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,458
She is etched so
deeply into my mind.

97
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,708
I will never be free
until I see her again.

98
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,500
Everything is there
in the Mystic Valley.

99
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,625
Everything I've been
searching for.

100
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,625
[ALLEN]
What a joke!

101
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,375
So he left his home,
he left his family,

102
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:38,666
just to find some girl he'd only
seen once before? Pathetic.

103
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,041
Well, honestly, he sounds
like my kinda guy.

104
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,416
[ALLEN]
What?

105
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
He's a lot more interesting
than my old man, anyway.

106
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,875
All he does is sit
and count his money.

107
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,541
Your father was a risk taker.

108
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,333
Wasn't afraid to
chase his dreams.

109
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,500
Ignore him, Allen.

110
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,958
[AMANO] Really? Nobody
has found Hitomi yet?

111
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,208
[HITOMI'S MOTHER]
No. I'm afraid not.

112
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:11,166
But please, you really
mustn't blame yourself.

113
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,875
This isn't anyone's fault.

114
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,375
I dream about her.

115
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,583
I'm standing alone
at the station.

116
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,458
I'm on my way to school, waiting
for Hitomi to meet up with me,

117
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,000
like she does every day.

118
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,583
Then she comes running over,
and says, "Good morning."

119
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:28,458
But right after-- That's
when I always wake up.

120
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,875
[AMANO]
It's okay.

121
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:35,291
I know how you feel. I dream
about Hitomi, as well.

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,250
My daughter will be all right.
I feel that in my soul.

123
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,375
She'll hit some
difficult patches,

124
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,708
but I know she'll pull through.

125
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,250
[REEDEN] Awww. Nothin'
but horizon out there.

126
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,458
All that ocean's
messin' up my view.

127
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,541
What now, Sarge?

128
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,208
Keep going straight ahead.

129
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,916
Dryden insisted this is
the best way to get there.

130
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,208
Yeah, but can we really
trust that shady guy?

131
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,333
Commander gave us
an order, so do it!

132
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,625
I'm not gonna tell you again.

133
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,666
Hey, Pyle! How's it
goin' down there?

134
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,583
All right, we're
makin' some headway.

135
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,250
It's still gonna take
a little more time

136
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,083
to install the control
chamber parts

137
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,208
we took out of Dryden's
Guymelefs, though.

138
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,583
[TEO]
Oh, that's just great.

139
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,541
I have the wrong
size screw here.

140
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,166
[ORT]
Careful. You'll break it.

141
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,666
[TEO]
Don't tell me what to do.

142
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,000
[DRYDEN]
"Blue, 16th moon.

143
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,000
Driven snow and jagged
rocks block my path,

144
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,250
as if to warn those who
dare challenge the mystery.

145
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,833
Has anybody else
ever made it this far?

146
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:40,583
Yesterday. I came upon a cave."

147
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:44,750
[LEON] Inside was a man, another
who sought the Mystic Valley.

148
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:48,708
Despite his age, he searched
as I did, eager for answers.

149
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,875
Desperate to find that which
had eluded him for so long.

150
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,583
A fellow traveler.

151
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:58,291
When I asked him his name,
the old man said Isaac.

152
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,416
[HITOMI'S MOTHER]
I've never shared this

153
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,625
with anyone before now.

154
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,458
But I think it's important
that you two know.

155
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,333
You see, when I was
only a little girl,

156
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,333
my mother told me
an amazing story.

157
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,750
She was just about the
same age Hitomi is now.

158
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,958
[HITOMI'S MOTHER] She was on her
way back home from a festival,

159
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,291
when a bright light
shone down on her,

160
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,750
and she suddenly realized
she was standing by herself

161
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,666
in a frightening
and unfamiliar land.

162
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:37,166
[LEON] Isaac and I sat down to
talk, and he told me his story.

163
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,750
He, too, was looking
for the Mystic Valley,

164
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:43,000
and the ancient
mystery of Atlantis.

165
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,208
Then he told me
something incredible.

166
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,583
Something I almost
couldn't believe.

167
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:51,250
He'd come from the Mystic
Moon, just like her!

168
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,958
He was from the
Mystic Moon, too?

169
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,083
Yes. Pretty amazing, isn't it?

170
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,750
Wait, is that--?

171
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,750
[YUKARI]
Hitomi?

172
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,083
No, it's my mother, actually.

173
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,166
[HITOMI]
Then this means...

174
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,791
That man must be Allen's father.

175
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,916
That light again.

176
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,708
That girl looks like...

177
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,916
Am I seeing things?

178
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:26,041
[LEON] You're from the Mystic
Moon? That's incredible.

179
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,875
I left on this journey
because I wanted to be free,

180
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,541
to roam the world
without any ties.

181
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,708
But now, when I gaze
into your eyes,

182
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:39,125
I begin to think that's
not what I want at all.

183
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:43,208
How can I feel both lost
and found at the same time?

184
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:07,875
[HITOMI'S GRANDMOTHER]
Hitomi.

185
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,291
[gasps]

186
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,250
Hitomi?

187
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,083
It was my Grandma.

188
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,291
[SORCERER A] Thank you for this
audience, General Adelphos,

189
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,958
we have come to ask
your permission

190
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,791
to take Dilandau back with us.

191
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,333
[ADELPHOS]
Hmph.

192
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,208
I never heard of a Sorcerer
asking permission for anything.

193
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,541
Do what you want.

194
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,416
Besides you were the
ones who sent him to me

195
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,250
in the first place.

196
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,458
I am curious, though. May I
ask why you want him back?

197
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,916
[SORCERER A] We've received
word from Strategos Folken.

198
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,916
Dilandau has fallen ill
and needs immediate care.

199
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,083
Ugh. Quite frankly, I find
that difficult to believe.

200
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,708
I didn't know monsters could
get sick like we humans.

201
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,375
If you'll excuse me, we can't
afford to waste any time,

202
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,208
given the serious nature
of his condition.

203
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:54,291
Once he has recovered,
we will return him to you.

204
00:13:54,375 --> 00:14:00,708
[DILANDAU screaming]

205
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,000
He's becoming more
unstable by the moment.

206
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,208
But what's causing it?

207
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,708
[SORCERER A]
The fate alteration experiment

208
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,666
wasn't completely successful.

209
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,208
[SORCERER B] Folken doesn't
need to know the details.

210
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,000
[SORCERER A]
Very well.

211
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:17,375
No! Shesta! Dallet!
Where are you?!

212
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,416
[MALE SORCERER B] He will get
much worse if this keeps up.

213
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,958
[MALE SORCERER C]
Put him to sleep.

214
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,333
That will do for now.

215
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,708
Once we return to the Homeland,

216
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,583
we will try performing
another alteration.

217
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,791
[DORNKIRK]
Asgard, you say?

218
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,250
That can only mean one thing.

219
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,458
Unless I am very much mistaken,

220
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,416
they're heading for
the Mystic Valley.

221
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,916
Forgive me, Emperor,
are you sure?

222
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,916
The Mystic Valley is a legend.

223
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,833
[DORNKIRK]
Indeed it is.

224
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:54,000
The homeland of the Draconians,
the ancient people of Atlantis.

225
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:57,541
And it would appear
they've found it.

226
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,833
[LEON]
White, 3rd moon.

227
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:05,541
Isaac and I had come upon a
moor shrouded in fog so thick

228
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,000
we could hardly see.

229
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,708
I felt certain we were closing
in on the Mystic Valley.

230
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:15,625
But at some point, I don't
know exactly when, or how,

231
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,541
Isaac disappeared.

232
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,833
Did he become lost in the fog?

233
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:23,416
Perhaps he was injured
somehow and fell behind?

234
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,916
It doesn't matter.

235
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,166
I cannot allow myself to be
distracted by anything now.

236
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,541
I must focus on reaching
the Mystic Valley.

237
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,541
Then I can solve the
mystery of Atlantis

238
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,833
and harness that ancient power.

239
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:40,041
Then perhaps, after
all these long years,

240
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,833
I can look upon that girl again.

241
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:46,083
If I could only see her
face, just once more.

242
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,416
I've heard enough!

243
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,208
Allen, wait!

244
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,125
Aw, running away?

245
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,833
I can't believe
this is all it takes

246
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,500
to get a rise out of one of
the fearless Knights Caeli.

247
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,291
That's just so sad.

248
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:03,541
Think it's safe to say that you
and I will never be friends.

249
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,958
Ha! Well, I am relieved
to hear that!

250
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,041
Being your friend is
the last thing I want.

251
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,916
[HITOMI]
Dryden.

252
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,458
Why are you being so mean?

253
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:13,875
Hitomi!

254
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:19,333
Ahh. I'm not very popular
with the ladies today.

255
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,458
Are you okay, Allen?

256
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,625
[ALLEN]
Hitomi.

257
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,291
[HITOMI]
Yes.

258
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,583
[ALLEN] I'm sorry you had
to witness that ugliness.

259
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:38,166
[HITOMI]
That's okay. Dryden's a jerk.

260
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,208
I still can't forgive my father,

261
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,625
and I don't think
I'll ever be able to.

262
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,416
He abandoned us.
He's dead to me.

263
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,458
I don't think you
really mean that.

264
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,375
You kept your father's
journal all this time.

265
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,458
I bet it's more important to
you than you even realize.

266
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,708
You could've thrown
it away, but you didn't.

267
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,166
I think, somewhere
deep down in your heart,

268
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,208
you wanted to know more
about who your father was.

269
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,250
To try to understand him better.

270
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,958
You're one of the
kindest people I know.

271
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:12,208
You don't have it in you to
hate somebody else that much.

272
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,875
Everyone here thinks
the world of you.

273
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,708
If you were really
that cold inside,

274
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:20,500
then nobody, including me,
would feel that way.

275
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,500
We wouldn't even like you.

276
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,000
You should forgive him.

277
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,375
Hatred doesn't solve anything,

278
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,500
and it only hurts
you in the end.

279
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,875
Maybe I was afraid of
finding out the truth.

280
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:34,416
That he didn't love us enough
and he really did abandon us.

281
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,541
I didn't wanna believe it,

282
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,958
and reading it
would've made it real.

283
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,666
I understand.

284
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,875
I know I don't deserve it,

285
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,500
but please say you'll
forgive my weakness.

286
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:54,000
We're almost there.
Just a little more chop.

287
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:57,541
I'm going up to check.
You stay here, Merle.

288
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,541
King Van, come back.

289
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,458
What in the hell?

290
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,541
There's a levistone
storm out there!

291
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,916
Hey, Reeden! Keep
your eyes wide open!

292
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,500
If we hit one, we're dead!

293
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,708
[REEDEN]
Yes, sir!

294
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,541
I'm so sorry.

295
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,666
There you are, I've
been looking all over.

296
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,416
We should get up
to the pilothouse.

297
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,791
C'mon. We're in the homestretch.

298
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,458
[REEDEN]
Levistone ahead! Hard to port!

299
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:50,875
[KIO]
Can do!

300
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,875
Steady, man! We're
getting real close, now.

301
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,208
[KIO]
Aye, sir!

302
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,500
A clear patch.

303
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,041
The Mystic Valley is just ahead.

304
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,375
[HITOMI] Is this really
the Mystic Valley?

305
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,666
[VAN]
There's nothing down there.

306
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,916
What do you mean?
That's impossible.

307
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,625
Uh.

308
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,250
Hey, what's the matter?

309
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,125
[DRYDEN] A page has been
torn out of the log.

310
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,583
[PYLE] Sarge! Zaibach
floating fortress in sight!

311
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:37,791
[GADDES]
What?

312
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,541
[ZAIBACH SOLDIER A]
Asturian skiff spotted!

313
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,791
[FOLKEN]
Excellent.

314
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,833
Naria. Eriya.
Girls, do you read me?

315
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,916
Absolutely, Lord Folken.
We're ready at any time.

316
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,625
We'll bring your little brother
back to you alive and unharmed.

317
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,375
I'm counting on you.

318
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,458
Let's do it, Eriya.

319
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,750
Loud and clear, sister.

320
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,416
No doubt about it.

321
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,541
That's them for sure.

322
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,541
What? How did they find us?

323
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,416
They're trying to force us down.

324
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,166
Pyle! How's Scherazade coming?

325
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,625
[PYLE] Not even close! We're
still less than half done!

326
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:23,333
[HITOMI'S GRANDMOTHER]
Hitomi.

327
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,291
[HITOMI gasps]

328
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,458
[HITOMI'S GRANDMOTHER]
I promise,

329
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,666
if your wishes are pure
and clear enough,

330
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,583
every last one will come true.

331
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:35,833
Hitomi, I want you to have this.

332
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,625
[HITOMI] Grandma.
Show us the Mystic Valley.

333
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:46,375
Please tell us where it is.
We need your help.

334
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,250
[DRYDEN] I won't be denied.
I've come too far.

335
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,708
I will see the Mystic Valley!

336
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:56,166
[VAN] Mother, what would
you want me to do?

337
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,083
[ALLEN]
I refuse to die now. Not here.

338
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,625
Mark my words, Father.

339
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,500
I'll settle things with
you once and for all

340
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,250
in the Mystic Valley.

341
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,625
[chuckling]

342
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,208
So, brother,

343
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:17,708
what truth do you hope the
Mystic Valley will reveal?

344
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:43,083
[FOLKEN] It can't be. The Gate
of Atlantis is opening.

345
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,666
But how?

346
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:10,791
[NARRATOR]
Escaflowne.

347
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:15,458
[VAN]
Stay away from me!

348
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:16,916
[BALGUS]
Listen to me King Van.

349
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
[VAN yelling]
