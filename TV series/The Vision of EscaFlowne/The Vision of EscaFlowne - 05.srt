1
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:54,000
[HITOMI] Was it all just a
dream? Or was it a vision?

2
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,791
The giants that attacked
Fanelia appeared again,

3
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:59,166
setting fire to Allen's castle.

4
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,875
Just as I thought, another one
of my visions had come true.

5
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:07,041
They started chasing us,
but Van changed Escaflowne

6
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,458
into a dragon to divert
their attention.

7
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:13,000
His trick worked.
The enemy followed Van.

8
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,500
And the rest of us escaped.

9
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,458
[DILANDAU]
Come on, move it!

10
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:20,041
Fly faster, or we're never
going to catch up!

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,250
[VAN grunts]

12
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:28,208
How I love a moving target!

13
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,666
[VAN grunts]

14
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,375
[VAN grunting]

15
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,250
[VAN]
The wind's too strong!

16
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,250
You bastards. You can't
hide from me forever!

17
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,291
What?!

18
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,125
[VAN]
Damn it!

19
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,750
[DILANDAU chuckles]
Too late, you're mine now.

20
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,333
[VAN growling]

21
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:35,166
You set yourself up as a decoy
so the others could escape, huh?

22
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,083
Well, this'll be the last
time you'll ever dare

23
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,208
make a fool out of me!

24
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,333
[VAN groans]

25
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,833
[VAN grunting]

26
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,416
[VAN grunting]

27
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,541
I've had it with you!

28
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,500
Really? He's down already?

29
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,000
[FOLKEN] Don't you dare
kill him, Dilandau.

30
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,125
I told you I wanted him alive.

31
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:08,375
[DILANDAU] Aw, I was just
having a little fun, Folken.

32
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,791
[REEDEN]
Fire, sir!

33
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,250
[ALLEN]
Is there any Melef wreckage?

34
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,000
[REEDEN]
I don't think so, sir.

35
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,041
[ALLEN]
I see.

36
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,291
[HITOMI]
Huh?

37
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,666
[MERLE] They wouldn't
kill him, would they?!

38
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,333
No. They won't do that,
they need him far too much.

39
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,083
As the King of Fanelia,
he's the only one

40
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,750
who knows how to
operate Escaflowne.

41
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,041
[GADDES]
Don't fret, kitten,

42
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,125
we'll get him back here
without a scratch.

43
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,750
We owe those lowlifes
payback for the castle.

44
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,750
We gotta hit 'em hard,
right where it hurts!

45
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,250
They won't see it comin'.

46
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,875
Let's do this!

47
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,500
Ready for orders, Commander.

48
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,125
How many men do we have left?

49
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:02,000
Including me,
we've got seven fighters.

50
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,583
That won't be
nearly enough men

51
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:07,000
for a frontal assault against
that floating fortress.

52
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,208
Besides, we still have
to locate them first.

53
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,833
Listen. Hey, Allen?

54
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:15,541
[ALLEN]
Hm?

55
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,291
I think, maybe.

56
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:21,375
I have an idea how to find Van.
I'm pretty sure it'll work.

57
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,583
Well, you did predict
the attack on the castle,

58
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,791
but that's not
enough. I'm sorry.

59
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,000
But I swear, that
was no coincidence!

60
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,000
I can see it in my mind!

61
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,208
I mean, ever since I was little,

62
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,291
I've had these hunches,
and they're usually right.

63
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,625
Lately, I can't explain it,
but that power has been

64
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,750
getting stronger, and I want
to put it to good use!

65
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,583
Be that as it may, my dear,

66
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,208
I'd prefer that you leave
this to us knights.

67
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:49,500
You understand, don't you?

68
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,833
[foot steps]

69
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,833
Hey, wait! If it will
help you can test me!

70
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,750
I'll prove it to you!

71
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,750
[DILANDAU] I've sent out
search and destroy teams.

72
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,958
They can't return
to their homeland.

73
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,250
There's no reason we should
have to keep hiding out here

74
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,666
like cowards anymore.

75
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,916
[FOLKEN] There's no
need to be careless.

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,625
We'll wait for your
men to report back.

77
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,458
[DILANDAU] Hm. I don't know
why you're always so cautious.

78
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,541
Uh!

79
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,083
Come on, what are
you worried about?

80
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,333
Now we've got this,
our future is secure.

81
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,541
Let's drag the samurai out
of there and destroy it,

82
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,583
so we can finally
move forward!

83
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,333
[FOLKEN] I'm afraid
I can't allow that.

84
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,208
[DILANDAU]
Why not?

85
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,208
There is much more
to learn about it.

86
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,958
We do not yet understand
its full power.

87
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:10,375
Or what makes it a credible
threat to our future.

88
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:17,500
[gasps]

89
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,541
[whimpering]

90
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,083
What?! That jerk!

91
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:38,583
[FOLKEN] Yes, Fanelia's
brand new monarch.

92
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:54,166
[TEO] Close one!
Glad they didn't look down.

93
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,833
[PYLE]
Hey. So what's your take?

94
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,375
Think she'll get it
all out of him?

95
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,583
Y'know, his past and stuff?

96
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,625
[REEDEN]
Shh! They're gonna hear you!

97
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,375
[HITOMI]
This is the Fool card.

98
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,000
A life of independence.

99
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:25,125
Rash actions,
defying common sense.

100
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,083
The essence of your
father's personality

101
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,958
is revealed in this card.

102
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:33,083
Its shadow haunts and poisons
your heritage, and always has.

103
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,041
A family... divided.

104
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,416
[PYLE]
So, think she right?

105
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,958
[KIO]
How should I know?

106
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:41,250
It's not like the boss ever
talks anything personal with us.

107
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,791
[HITOMI]
It's a good reading.

108
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,041
His sister's mysterious
disappearance.

109
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,875
His mother's early death.

110
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,083
He blames his father for it all.

111
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,875
Please, what else do you see?

112
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,333
[HITOMI]
What should I do?

113
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:57,208
He looks pretty upset!
Maybe I should stop.

114
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,208
[HITOMI]
No.

115
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,708
It's important for
him to believe me,

116
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,000
or this won't work.

117
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,500
What is it?
What's wrong?

118
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,333
Uh! Nothing!

119
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,958
[HITOMI]
Come on... spit it out!

120
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:14,291
[HITOMI] This is Justice.
The judgment card.

121
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,625
According to this,

122
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,875
it's possible you and your
father will be reunited

123
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,750
in the near future.

124
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,041
But, you can't let
go of the past.

125
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,666
You still have a lot
of anger towards him.

126
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:30,000
And, um, this one.
Th-This card here.

127
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,250
That's enough,
Hitomi. Thank you.

128
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:39,125
[gasps] Uh, there's
still more, though.

129
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,125
[ALLEN]
I'm convinced.

130
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,916
So now, here's your chance.

131
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,666
It's time to find Van.

132
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,250
Uh!

133
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,291
Okay!

134
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:56,541
[whistling]

135
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,791
Who are you?!

136
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,875
Why are you whistling
a Fanelian song?

137
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,291
[gasps]

138
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,083
[VAN grunts]

139
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,333
All right, show me the way
back to my Guymelef, now!

140
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,041
[FOLKEN] Hmph. You can
swing that sword around

141
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,125
as much as you want.

142
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,000
It isn't going to
get you anywhere.

143
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,416
There will be no escape
from this floating fortress,

144
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,333
not for you, or Escaflowne.

145
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,708
[gasps]

146
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,500
[growling]

147
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:53,083
I would rather perish by my own
hand than become your pawn.

148
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,125
[gasps]

149
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:02,583
[FOLKEN] I wouldn't be so quick
to throw your life away.

150
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,375
You're... my brother.

151
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,083
Will that stupid little toy
really help us find him?

152
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,291
[MERLE]
Shh!

153
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:39,375
[exhales] Hey, if she says
it'll work, it'll work.

154
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,750
[FOLKEN] It's been a
long time indeed, Van.

155
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,250
Ten years now, is it?

156
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,583
The story always did seem odd.

157
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,000
I never really believed

158
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,208
you ran away from the
Rite of Succession,

159
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,916
I thought the dragon killed you.

160
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,875
I thought you'd
faced it head on,

161
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,250
that you'd battled it
to the bitter end.

162
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,958
It was all a lie!

163
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:06,458
Why are you with Zaibach?!
How could you destroy Fanelia?!

164
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,791
Are you going to answer?

165
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:15,500
Wipe that smile off your face.

166
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,458
Look at me!

167
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,000
[gasps]

168
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,625
Van, my brother, the Zaibach
Emperor needs someone like you.

169
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,791
Come with me and we will
both serve Dornkirk.

170
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:30,875
You and I will help the empire
set the future back on course.

171
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,625

[ALLEN]
Do you want to rest a bit?

175
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,500
No, I'm fine.
I need to keep at it.

176
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:02,458
Although, I wish we had
something of Van's here.

177
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,833
[MERLE]
We do! Look.

178
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:05,916
[HITOMI]
Uh.

179
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,000
Okay, now what?

180
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:14,166
Picture him in your mind,
as clearly as you can.

181
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,083
[HITOMI gasps]

182
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,000
[ALLEN]
Look at that.

183
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,458
It picked out a place where
the wandering earth collects.

184
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,083
What does that mean?

185
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:46,166
Well, it means Levistones like
the ones we power the ship with.

186
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,583
Bullseye! That's the
perfect hiding place

187
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,375
for a floating fortress!

Hey, wake up!

190
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,291
[DILANDAU]
Hm. So this is the threat

191
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,333
to the future of the
Zaibach Empire, huh?

192
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:05,208
Heh. It's just a pile
of old scrap metal.

193
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,250
I can't make any
sense of this.

194
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,916
There must be some trick to it,
Folken got it to open for him.

[REEDEN]
Well, well. We gotcha now!

Floating fortress is spotted!

197
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,958
Right, heat the levistones!

198
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:31,458
Cut our levitation power and
let's charge the fortress!

Levitation down to 20!

I don't know!

233
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,750
Well we certainly
can't do anything

234
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,250
until we know what
his orders are.

Saw what?

I have to go!

to explain. Let's go.

five-point-four meters. Yes!

You're out of your mind,
no way you'll clear that!

Please, I'm telling you,
just don't do it!

269
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,916
Can't you see how
far away that is?

270
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,333
If you fall, you're
gonna die for sure!

00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:22,291
I was trying to save you
guys, but once again,

322
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,833
you wound up saving me.

323
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,875
We have Hitomi here
to thank for that.

324
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,541
Oh, yeah?

325
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:28,666
Uh.

326
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,166
[VAN]
Thanks, I guess.

327
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,958
[HITOMI gasps, growls]

328
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,750
[REEDEN]
Hard a-starboard!

329
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:38,125
[ALLEN] Set course for
Palas, we're going home!

330
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,166
Palas, huh?

331
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,791
[NARRATOR]
Escaflowne.

332
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,375
[MILLERNA]
Allen!

333
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,125
[ALLEN]
Princess Millerna!

334
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:18,833
[MILLERNA chuckles]

335
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:21,000
Do you want to fight?
Is that it?
