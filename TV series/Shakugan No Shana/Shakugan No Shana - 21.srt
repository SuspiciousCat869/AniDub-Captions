1
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,833
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,000
LIVES CONSUMED IN

3
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,833
SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.
NO ONE CAN TELL WHEN

4
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,375
THE WORLD IS DISPLACED,
AND THE FLAMES OF THE

5
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:45,916
CRIMSON WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,458
- ( theme song playing )

7
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:51,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

8
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,708
ON A STROLL AT THIS LATE HOUR?

9
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:21,500
YOU'VE INDEED SAVED ME THE
TROUBLE OF DRAWING YOU OUT.

10
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:25,916
- ( screams )

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,625
- YOU WON'T SUFFER LONG.
- Tiamat: SINGLE SHOT KILL.

12
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,875
- INDEED, IT'S NO
USE CALLING FOR HELP.

13
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,416
THE FLAME-HAIRED BLAZING-EYED
HUNTER FULLY SUPPORTS

14
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,416
MY DECISION TO DESTROY YOU.

15
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,541
- ( gasps )

16
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,833
- SHANA SUPPORTS THIS?

17
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,250
- YUJI!

18
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:18,958
- ( grunts )

19
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,875
- ( coughs )

20
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:37,750
- HOW CURIOUS. INDEED YOU CAN
CONTROL SOME POWER OF EXISTENCE.

21
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,166
- Tiamat: RIDICULOUS.

22
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,791
- ( gasps ) SHANA!

23
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,291
- SHANA DIDN'T GIVE ME UP.

24
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,750
- Wirhelmina: WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE?

25
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:05,083
AFTER ALL, YOU AGREED TO
THE DESTRUCTION OF THE MYSTES.

26
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:08,875
INDEED, I ASK YOU TO MOVE
OUT OF THE WAY.

27
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,750
- Wirhelmina: NOW.
- Tiamat: WITHDRAW.

28
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,041
- Alastor: SHANA.

29
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,625
- ( shrieks )

30
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,375
- TELL ME,
DO YOU INDEED OBJECT

31
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,125
TO THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE MYSTES?

32
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,375
RANDOMLY TRANSFERRING THE
MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD

33
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,833
TO A NEW LOCATION
WOULD INDEED ENABLE US TO

34
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:42,083
AVOID A CONFRONTATION WITH
THE BALL MASQUE.

35
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,875
A MAJOR BATTLE WILL
UPSET THE BALANCE OF THE WORLD.

36
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:48,833
FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE,
IT IS THE ONLY PRACTICAL CHOICE.

37
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:52,375
INDEED. GIVEN THAT WE'RE
UNAWARE OF THE ENEMY'S PLANS,

38
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,375
AND THAT THEY MAY, IN FACT,
ALREADY BE IN MOTION,

39
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,208
THIS IS OUR BEST MOVE.

40
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:00,000
BUT INDEED YOU
ALREADY KNOW THIS,

41
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,000
BECAUSE YOU ARE A FLAME HAZE.

42
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,750
ARE YOU INDEED STILL OPPOSED?

43
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,708
- SHANA.

44
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,166
- WHAT IS THIS STRANGE FEELING?

45
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,125
- Sydonay: HECATE, WHAT'S
THE MATTER?

46
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,541
- Hecate: THE PALACE OF STARS
IS TREMBLING.

47
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,000
- Sydonay: YEAH, BECAUSE THAT
HAG, BEL PEOL,

48
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:10,083
HAD THE CRAZY PROFESSOR FIDDLE
AROUND WITH IT.

49
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,666
THEY'RE PLANNING ON
ACTIVATING THE WHOLE

50
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,833
SACRED CHAPEL FOR REAL.

51
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,791
- Hecate: THE SACRED CHAPEL.

52
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,375
- Sydonay:
YOU'RE GOING TO BE BUSY.

53
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,041
SOON, YOU'LL HAVE NO
TIME FOR PRAYING.

54
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,166
MIGHT BE EASIER JUST TO
TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT.

55
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,625
- WHAT DO YOU WISH FOR?
- AN ANSWER.

56
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,500
I WANT THE ANSWER
TO WHAT I DESIRE.

57
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,166
- AND WHAT IS THAT?

58
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,458
- I DESIRE THE THING I DESIRE.

59
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,250
- ( Bel Peol chuckles )

60
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,625
- YOU'LL GET THE SAME
RESPONSE EVERY TIME.

61
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,375
IT SEEMS SHE DOESN'T
DESIRE ANYTHING.

62
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:43,833
HOWEVER, ONCE THE SACRED
CHAPEL HAS BEEN ACTIVATED,

63
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,458
THIS CHILD WILL BE
IN GREAT DEMAND.

64
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,833
- THAT'S FINE WITH ME.

65
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,583
BUT YOU'RE CERTAIN HECATE
WON'T BE HARMED BY THIS?

66
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:54,500
- RELAX, THOUSAND CHANGES.
HECATE WILL BECOME ETERNAL,

67
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:57,208
AND POWER OF EXISTENCE
WILL FLOW FOREVER.

68
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:01,208
- HMM, WELL, I'LL DO MY PART
TO ENSURE IT HAPPENS.

69
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,416
I JUST WANT TO PROTECT HECATE.

70
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,250
- REMEMBER, I DO NOT
BELONG TO YOU.

71
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:10,875
- MORES THE PITY. HECATE,
YOU ARE PURE AND UNSPOILED.

72
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,166
PLEASE STAY THAT WAY.

73
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,833
- IT'S ALMOST COMPLETE.

74
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,666
SOON I'LL HAVE ACHIEVED WHAT
NO OTHER CRIMSON LORD

75
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,041
HAS EVER DREAMED OF,

76
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,791
A FOUNT OF EXISTENCE.

77
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,500
- ( machine creaking )

78
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,291
- IF YOU HAVE NO
ANSWER FOR ME,

79
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:00,291
THEN INDEED REFRAIN FROM
GETTING IN MY WAY.

80
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,375
- Tiamat: DESTROY.

81
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,416
- THERE'S NO WAY SHANA
CAN OPPOSE THEM.

82
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,541
THAT'S BECAUSE
SHE'S A FLAME HAZE.

83
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,500
- Alastor: WAIT, SPECIALIST
OF EVERYTHING!

84
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,458
- ( both gasp )

85
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,250
- Alastor: WE'RE NOT DONE
WITH THIS MYSTES.

86
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,458
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
- Alastor: WE NEED TO HEAR HIM.

87
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,541
EARLIER IN THE DAY,

88
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,666
HE WAS TRYING TO TELL US
ABOUT A DENIZEN.

89
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,041
- ( gasps )

90
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,500
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT!
THE DENIZEN'S BIRD ORNAMENTS.

91
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,333
- Alastor: SHANA, YOU WERE GOING
TO ASK ABOUT THAT, WEREN'T YOU?

92
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,916
- UH, YEAH.

93
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,791
- A TRIVIAL REASON TO
POSTPONE ITS DESTRUCTION.

94
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,583
- Alastor: YOU CANNOT
ASSUME THIS IS TRIVIAL.

95
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,750
THIS MYSTES HAS AIDED US ON A
NUMBER OF OCCASIONS

96
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,333
WITH HIS INSIGHT.

97
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,416
- THAT'S RIGHT. HE HELPED US
IN THE LAST BATTLE.

98
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,083
I THINK IT WOULD BE WISE
TO HEAR IT.

99
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,625
WHAT THE MYSTES SAYS.

100
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,666
- WHAT THE MYSTES SAYS.

101
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,458
- THAT LOOK ON HER FACE.
IS IT THAT IMPORTANT?

102
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,750
IF YOU TWO FEEL THIS
STRONGLY ABOUT IT,

103
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,333
THEN I GUESS THERE MUST BE
SOME VALUE, INDEED,

104
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,833
IN KEEPING THE MYSTES AROUND.

105
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,208
I WILL POSTPONE DESTROYING
IT JUST THIS ONE TIME.

106
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,333
- Tiamat: ACKNOWLEDGED.

107
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,083
- WIRHELMINA.

108
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,958
- INDEED I BELIEVE YOU.

109
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:45,208
I INDEED DO NOT WISH TO
LOSE HOPE IN YOU.

110
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,166
- SO, WHAT I WAS TRYING
TO TELL YOU...

111
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,625
THE CITY'S REMAINING
BIRD ORNAMENTS...

112
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,625
I WAS WONDERING IF
THEY'RE STILL SAFE.

113
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,833
- Shana: Hmm?

114
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:08,458
THAT DENIZEN YESTERDAY DIDN'T
TURN ALL OF THEM INTO RINNES.

115
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,458
HE REALLY HAD NO USE FOR THEM?

116
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,041
- Alastor: YOU'RE SAYING
THEY COULD STILL POSE

117
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,875
SOME KIND OF DANGER TO US.

118
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,916
- WE REALLY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT HE WAS TRYING

119
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
TO ACCOMPLISH, NOW DO WE?

120
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,291
WHAT IF WE CAN'T
FIGURE IT OUT,

121
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,208
BECAUSE HIS PLAN
ISN'T FINISHED YET?

122
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,166
- Alastor: YOU HAVE A POINT.

123
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,375
IT CERTAINLY IS A POSSIBILITY.

124
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,458
AND MORE THAN ENOUGH
REASON TO BE CAUTIOUS.

125
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,041
- THAT MAKES SENSE.

126
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,791
- WAS THAT WORTH
KEEPING ME AROUND?

127
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:34,958
- ( Shana gasps )

128
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,541
- Shana: I ONLY MEANT...
- I KNOW.

129
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:42,125
I'M A MYSTES, AND YOU'RE ONLY
A FLAME HAZE, RIGHT?

130
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,375
- SAKAI AND YUKARI.

131
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:56,583
- SHANA LISTEN, I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.

132
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,958
- I'M GONNA LEAVE.
- HUH?

133
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,750
- YUJI!
- I'VE BEEN THINKING.

134
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,666
I'VE DECIDED I CAN'T INVOLVE
THIS CITY OR THE PEOPLE IN IT

135
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,708
IN ANY MORE BATTLES.

136
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,000
HEADING OUT ON THE ROAD IS
THE ONLY THING I CAN DO

137
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,708
TO HELP PROTECT EVERYONE.

138
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,791
- Shana: PROTECT EVERYONE.

139
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,875
- I WANNA PROTECT THE PEOPLE.

140
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,666
- FOR THE PEOPLE?

141
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,541
NO, THIS ISN'T WHAT I WANT.

142
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,708
I WANT HIM TO COME WITH ME,
BUT NOT FOR THIS REASON.

143
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:32,208
- Yuji: SO, I'M GONNA LEAVE
THE CITY.

144
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,750
- IT'S ALL WRONG!

145
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,375
BECAUSE IF YOU LEAVE, UM, BALL
MASQUE WILL STILL CHASE YOU,

146
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,666
OR YOU COULD BE TRACKED
DOWN BY OTHER DENIZENS.

147
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,958
- SO I'LL CHANGE LOCATIONS,
OR I'LL FIGHT BACK.

148
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,833
- YOU CAN'T!
- WHY NOT?

149
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,875
- YOU CAN'T, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T.

150
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,000
- Yuji: YOU'RE TELLING ME I
SHOULD STAY HERE?

151
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:53,250
- Shana: I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
- Yuji: WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

152
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,541
- I BET YOU'RE GOING TO
DESTROY ME, AREN'T YOU?

153
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,916
- Shana: NO!

154
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,708
- I MEAN THAT'S WHAT ANY OTHER
FLAME HAZE WOULD DO

155
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,583
WHEN FACED WITH THIS
PROBLEM, ISN'T IT?

156
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,291
- NO, YOU'RE WRONG!
THAT'S NOT IT!

157
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,375
- THEN WHAT ELSE AM
I SUPPOSED TO DO?

158
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:12,000
SHANA I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S
GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD.

159
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,416
- YUJI.

160
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,250
- Yoshida: SAKAI.

161
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:54,208
- YOSHIDA, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT THIS LATE?

162
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:59,041
- I GUESS IT'S BECAUSE OF THE
SPECIAL AMULET, THAT'S WHY.

163
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,208
- I SEE. YOU FELT THE SEAL.

164
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,208
- SAKAI, ARE YOU REALLY...

165
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,625
ARE YOU REALLY THINKING
OF LEAVING HERE?

166
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,916
- YOU OVERHEARD ME?
- I'M SORRY.

167
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,583
- YEAH, IT'S TRUE.
- BUT WHY?

168
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,458
- YOSHIDA, PARTLY
BECAUSE OF YOU,

169
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:25,916
I MADE THE DECISION TO LEAVE.

170
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,291
YOU SAID THAT I'M A HUMAN BEING.

171
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,708
THEN I REALIZED HOW MUCH I
WANTED TO PROTECT THE THINGS

172
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,708
THAT WERE IMPORTANT TO
ME AS A PERSON.

173
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:39,708
BECAUSE OF THAT DESIRE, IT
PROVES I REALLY AM YUJI SAKAI.

174
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,708
- BUT... YES, BUT...

175
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,333
- THANKS, YOSHIDA. IT REALLY
MEANT A LOT TO ME

176
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,375
WHEN YOU TOLD ME HOW YOU FELT.

177
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:50,583
I'M SORRY, BUT MY
MIND'S MADE UP.

178
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,125
- SAKAI.

179
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,916
- Tanaka: GOOD FOR YOU!

180
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,541
- Yuji: TANAKA, SATO.

181
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,791
- Tanaka: I HAVE TO SAY, THAT
WAS PRETTY MOVING, SAKAI.

182
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,208
YOU'RE ALRIGHT IN MY
BOOKS, DUDE.

183
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,833
- Yuji: WHY ARE YOU HERE?

184
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,791
- WELL, APPARENTLY WE CAN DETECT
SEALS BECAUSE OF THIS THING.

185
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:17,000
- ACTUALLY WE WERE KINDA HOPING
BIG SISTER HAD COME BACK.

186
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,416
- Sato: SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.

187
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,791
I SAID WE'LL SEE IF
IT'S A DENIZEN,

188
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,375
AND IF IT IS WE'LL CLOBBER IT.

189
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,583
- SO YOU'RE SAYING MARGERY'S
NOT HERE ANYMORE?

190
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:30,000
- YEAH.
- THAT'S ALL OVER. ITS DONE.

191
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:35,625
- I SEE. MARGERY'S GONE, TOO.

192
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,125
- Alastor: I MUST SAY, I
SUPPORT YUJI SAKAI'S

193
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,000
OPINION ON THESE MATTERS.

194
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:43,125
CONCERNING WHETHER OR
NOT TO DESTROY HIM...

195
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:46,083
AND WHETHER TO
LEAVE THE CITY OR STAY...

196
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,541
- THAT MEANS...

197
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,208
- Alastor: YOU WOULD HAVE STRUCK
AT THE SPECIALIST OF EVERYTHING

198
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,791
WITH YOUR SWORD IF I
HADN'T INTERVENED.

199
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,166
BUT IT'S ALSO CLEAR
YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH

200
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,416
YOUR SENSE OF LOYALTY TO HER.

201
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,541
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO WITH YUJI SAKAI?

202
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,291
- I DON'T...

203
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,541
- Alastor: OR RATHER, WHAT
DO YOU WANT HIM TO DO?

204
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,708
- ( gasps )

205
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:13,875
I WANT YUJI TO...
YUJI SHOULD...

206
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,125
I DON'T KNOW. I HAVE NO IDEA!

207
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,875
- THEY'LL KILL YOU AND SEND
THAT MIDNIGHT DOOHICKEY

208
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,708
OFF SOMEWHERE ELSE?

209
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,166
- APPARENTLY THAT WOULD MAKE
IT REALLY HARD TO FIND AGAIN.

210
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,666
AND WITH THE MIDNIGHT
LOST CHILD GONE,

211
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,291
THERE'D BE NO REASON FOR
THE DENIZEN GROUP

212
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,583
BALL MASQUE TO
ATTACK MISAKI CITY.

213
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:45,375
- BUT THEN... YOU'LL DIE, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

214
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,208
- OH, NO.

215
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,375
- SO, IS HIRAI, I MEAN SHANA,

216
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,916
IS SHE ACTUALLY GOING
ALONG WITH THIS?

217
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,041
- SHANA? I DON'T KNOW.

218
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,208
DAMN ALL THOSE FLAME HAZES!

219
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,250
NONE OF THEM GIVE A CRAP
ABOUT ORDINARY PEOPLE ANYWAY.

220
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:07,500
- SAKAI, IF YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE
THE CITY, I'LL GO WITH YOU.

221
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,625
NOTHING ABOUT THIS PLACE OR
MY HOUSE IS KEEPING ME HERE.

222
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,708
I'D SURE FEEL BETTER
GETTING OUT.

223
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,791
- OKAY, I'M WITH YA.

224
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,708
CAN'T LET SAKAI SUFFER ALONE,
NOW CAN WE?

225
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,041
- THANKS, YOU GUYS.

226
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,500
- BUT WE CAN COME BACK EVERY
NOW AND THEN, RIGHT?

227
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,208
- YOU BACKIN' OUT ALREADY?

228
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,625
- Tanaka: I'D LIKE
TO SEE SOME PEOPLE.

229
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:28,500
- Sato: WHAT?

230
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,916
- Tanaka: UH, NOTHING.

231
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,458
- Sato: WHATTYA MEAN NOTHING?
- Tanaka: NEVER MIND!

232
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,583
- Sato: MIND WHAT?
- Tanaka: JUST FORGET IT!

233
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,000
- SAKAI'S PRETTY SERIOUS.

234
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,916
LEAVING THE
CITY'S A BIG DECISION.

235
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,333
BUT HE'S ABLE TO TALK
ABOUT IT SO CALMLY.

236
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,791
AND HE TALKS SO FRANKLY
WITH YUKARI ABOUT STUFF.

237
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,458
I THOUGHT BECAUSE
OF WHAT HAPPENED,

238
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,083
I'D GOTTEN CLOSER TO HIM.

239
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:04,500
BUT HE SEEMS FARTHER AWAY
NOW THAN HE WAS BEFORE.

240
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,791
- JUST IGNORE HER!

241
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:32,041
- Yuji: THAT'S WHEN SHE
STARTED ACTING STRANGELY.

242
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:36,000
BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN
THINKING ABOUT DESTROYING ME.

243
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,375
NATURALLY, AS A FLAME HAZE

244
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,708
SHE SEES ME AS NOTHING
MORE THAN A MYSTES.

245
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,500
- I WANT YUJI TO...

246
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,333
- Wirhelmina: INDEED
I BELIEVE YOU.

247
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,958
- YO! YOU SAID THERE WAS
SOMETHING ABOUT THESE THINGS

248
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,291
THAT HAD YOU WORRIED,

249
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,666
SO WE THOUGHT WE'D COME BY
TODAY AND CHECK 'EM OUT.

250
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,250
- BIG FIRE, NO PROBLEM.

251
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,666
- RIGHT. I'M SURE IT'S JUST
MY IMAGINATION ANYWAY.

252
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,125
- SAKAI.

253
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,750
- HEY LOOK, THERE'S A MAID OVER
THERE. AND HIRAI'S WITH HER.

254
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,125
- SHANA.

255
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,500
- Wirhelmina: I MUST ADMIT
THAT INDEED THE INSTINCTS

256
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,041
OF THE MYSTES ARE GOOD.

257
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,875
IT IS TOO EASY TO OVERLOOK ITEMS
THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN USED.

258
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,583
AND SO WE WILL KEEP WATCH
UNTIL THEY'VE ALL BEEN

259
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,541
REDUCED TO ASHES, JUST IN CASE.

260
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,125
- ( all grunting )

261
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:14,375
- Woman: OH, FANTASTIC!
- Sato: LOOKS LIKE IT'S FINE.

262
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,541
- Yuji: YEAH.

263
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,416
- ( people chattering )

264
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,041
- Tiamat: CAUTION.
- LOOKS BAD.

265
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,958
- Sato: AN UNRESTRICTED SYSTEM!

266
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,875
- Shana: BUT I DIDN'T
FEEL ANYTHING!

267
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,958
- Alastor: HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

268
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,625
- MAYBE LIGHTING THE FIRE WAS
THE SWITCH THAT TRIGGERED

269
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,375
THE UNRESTRICTED SYSTEM.

270
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,791
LOOK, THERE! THE SAME ONE!

271
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,625
- WIRHELMINA, SOMETHING'S
GOING TO APPEAR

272
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,041
RIGHT ABOVE THE SYSTEM.

273
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,916
- Wirhelmina: LIKE WHAT?

274
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,958
- Shana: LAST TIME, IT
WAS AN AIRSHIP.

275
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:06,958
- IT'S A SEAL!

276
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:26,916
- ( gasps )

277
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,750
- Sato: WHAT THE HELL'S THAT?

278
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,583
- Wirhelmna: WHY THAT'S...
- Alastor: INCREDIBLE.

279
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,875
- Shana: WHAT IS IT?
- Alastor: THE PALACE OF STARS!

280
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,375
- INDEED, THE HEADQUARTERS
OF THE BALL MASQUE.

281
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,333
- Alastor: JUDGE OF PARADOXES!
- BEL PEOL.

282
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,166
- IT'S BEEN A WHILE
FLAME OF HEAVEN

283
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,291
AND SPECIALIST OF EVERYTHING.

284
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:06,166
EVEN YOU TWO FAILED TO
SEE THE TRUTH BEHIND

285
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,750
THE DOUBLE LAYER WE SET UP.

286
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:18,208
- OH MY! FLAME HAZES
ARE ALWAYS SO EAGER TO FIGHT.

287
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:21,791
- SHE'S PART OF BALL MASQUE!
- Alastor: BEL PEOL,

288
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,625
SURELY YOU KNOW WHAT A
MAJOR INTERVENTION LIKE THIS

289
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,625
DOES TO THE BALANCE
OF THE WORLD.

290
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,208
- Bel Peol: YOU CONSIDER
THIS MAJOR?

291
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,500
THAT JUST GOES TO SHOW
HOW FAR YOU'VE FALLEN,

292
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,125
FLAME OF HEAVEN.

293
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,458
THE REAL INTERVENTION IS
ABOUT TO BEGIN RIGHT NOW.

294
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,833
SO JUST SIT BACK AND
WATCH THE SHOW

295
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,750
AS THIS CITY BECOMES
A FOUNT OF EXISTENCE.

296
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,708
- Alastor: A FOUNT OF EXISTENCE?
YOU MEAN...

297
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,833
- ( chuckles ) Bel Peol: OH YES!
- Alastor: HOW COULD YOU?

298
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,333
- THERE'S SOMETHING ODD HERE.

299
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:55,250
IT'S NOT LIKE HER TO COME
OUT AND BRAG ABOUT HER PLANS.

300
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,291
- LOOK, THERE IT IS.

301
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:05,625
- HOW CARELESS! THEY ARE AFTER
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

302
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:06,833
- Tiamat: DESTROY.

303
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,291
- WIRHELMINA, DON'T DO IT!

304
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:19,291
- SYDONAY!
- YOU ALWAYS WERE A SHARP ONE.

305
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:25,875
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, MYSTES.
YOU'RE THE ONE I CAME TO SEE.

306
