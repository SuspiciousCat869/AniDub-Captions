THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,500
LIVES CONSUMED IN

3
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,833
SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.
NO ONE CAN TELL WHEN

4
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,583
THE WORLD IS DISPLACED,
AND THE FLAMES OF THE

5
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:45,916
CRIMSON WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

AGES SINCE WE'VE HAD

12
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,375
A REAL KNOCKDOWN FIGHT,

13
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:17,500
MARGERY DAW, MY BEAUTIFUL
GOBLET. LET'S GET HIM!

14
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,916
- Alastor: THAT'S SUPREME
THRONE, HECATE.

15
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,333
SHE'S ONE OF THE LEADERS
OF BALL MASQUE.

16
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,958
- WELL, I DON'T CARE WHO SHE IS.

17
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,875
GIVE YUJI BACK TO ME.

18

- Yuji: SHANA.
- Hecate: YOU BELONG TO ME NOW.

19
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,500
WE'VE ALREADY OPENED OURSELVES
TO EACH OTHER.

20
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,416
( Hecate gasps )

- Alastor: THIS PRODUCTION
OF POWER OF EXISTENCE,

24
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,666
SHE SEEMS TO BE THE CORE
OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.

25
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,416

- Alastor: AS I FEARED,

31
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,458
THE ONLY WAY TO END THIS IS
TO STOP SUPREME THRONE.

32
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:21,333
WE MUST HURRY! AT THIS RATE,
THE CITY ITSELF MAY COLLAPSE.

33
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,500
- BUT WHAT CAN WE DO
TO STOP IT?

34
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,166
- Yuji: MISAKI CITY.

35
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,750
NO! I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

- ( Hecate exhales )

37
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,500
- Hecate: YOUR THOUGHTS
ARE FULFILLING ME.

38
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,583
IT'S SOMETHING I'VE NEVER BEEN
ABLE TO ACHIEVE BEFORE,

39
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:49,708
NO MATTER HOW MANY I'VE TOUCHED,
HOW MANY AMBITIONS I'VE FELT.

40
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,500
- Yuji: YOU'RE JUST...

- ( whimpers )

42
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,541
- Bel Peol: IT'S A SHAME.
I THINK WE'RE DONE.

43
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,458
I HAVE TO GO SEE
HOW HECATE IS DOING.

44
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,291
- A LITTLE LONGER.
YOUR PRESENCE IS STILL REQUIRED.

45
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,916
- Tiamat: CONTINUE BATTLE.

46
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,625

00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,500
- Margery: YOU'RE RIGHT.

51
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,958
CONCEIVABLY, WE COULD
FIGHT FOREVER.

52
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:13,500
- Marco: THOUSAND CHANGES, IS
THIS WHAT YOU GUYS REALLY WANT?

53
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,875
- OR MYSELF, I'D BE
HAPPY JUST TO HAVE

54
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,250
MY HECATE ACHIEVE FULFILLMENT.

55
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,541
- Marco: HUH. ANOTHER WEIRDO.

56
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,875
- Margery: YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
YOU PLAY WITH DOLLS.

57
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,125

58
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,791

- Yoshida: IT'S OKAY,
THEY'LL COME BACK. THEY WILL.

61
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:52,750
SAKAI AND YUKARI.
THEY'VE GOTTA MAKE IT.

62
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,208
- I CAN'T GET ANY CLOSER!

63
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,708
- Alastor: YOU MUST GET
YUJI SAKAI OUT OF THERE.

64
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,750
SEPARATE HER FROM
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD,

65
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,250
AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO STOP THIS MADNESS.

66
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,791
- I'M ON IT.

67
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,041
- Yuji: ARE YOU SAYING
YOU'RE SATISFIED

68
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:23,291
FULFILLING YOURSELF WITH MY
MEMORIES AND MY THOUGHTS?

69
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:27,250
- Hecate: I'VE ALWAYS DESIRED
IT. I'VE PRAYED FOR IT.

70
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,291
- Yuji: FOR THIS?
- Hecate: YES.

71
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,500
ONCE I MADE CONTACT,

72
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:39,250
I SUDDENLY REALIZED THAT
THIS IS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.

73
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,583
- Yuji: YOU'RE SHANA! STOP
SAYING YOU'RE ONLY A FLAME HAZE.

74
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:46,375
AND I'M NOT ONLY A TORCH.
I'M YUJI SAKAI!

75
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,875
- AND NOW I KNOW WHO I AM.

76
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,083
I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR MYSELF.

77
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,583
AND NOW I KNOW. I HAVE PROOF.

78
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:01,250
- I REALLY DO EXIST.
- Yuji: YOU'RE RIGHT.

79
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:05,125
WHEN WE FIRST MADE CONTACT,
YOU REALLY WERE EMPTY.

80
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:08,083
- Hecate: BUT NOT NOW.

81
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:12,708
I AM NO LONGER AN EMPTY VESSEL.
I AM COMPLETELY FULFILLED.

82
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:16,416
- Yuji: WITH MY MEMORIES.
- Hecate: MY MEMORIES NOW.

83
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,708
- Yuji: YOU'RE MISTAKEN.
- Hecate: HUH?

84
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,416
- Yuji: THERE'S NO POINT
IN FILLING YOURSELF

85
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,250
WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MEMORIES.

86
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,666
THAT'S NOT YOU.

87
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,208
- Hecate: BUT YOU'RE
JUST A TORCH,

88
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,041
AND YOU'RE FILLED
WITH YUJI SAKAI'S MEMORIES.

89
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:31,916
- Yuji: YEAH,

90
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,583
AND WHEN I FIRST MET SHANA,

91
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:39,541
IT'S TRUE THAT I WAS
NOTHING BUT A TORCH,

92
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,250
BUT NOW THINGS ARE DIFFERENT.

93
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,166
- Shana: YUJI.

94
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,958
- Yuji: EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT.

95
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,750
I KNOW THAT I'M THE ONE
WHO'S DOING ALL THE THINKING,

96
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,250
THE WORRYING, AND THE FEELING.

97
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,916
AND I KNOW FOR A FACT
THAT IT'S ALL TRUE.

98
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,958
- Shana: HA!

99
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,000
- ( grunts )

100
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,375
- Yuji: SO I'M YUJI SAKAI.
WHO ARE YOU?

101
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,500
WHERE ARE YOU? THE REAL YOU?

102
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,416
- ( Hecate sighs )

103
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,375
- Hecate: THE REAL ME.

104
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,125
- ( Shana grunts )

105
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,333
- ( screams )

106
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,666
- ( screams )

107
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,458
- Shana: YUJI, I'M HERE!
I'LL SAVE YOU!

108
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,416
- Yuji: SHANA.
- OH, YUJI.

109
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,333
- SHANA!

110
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:42,000
- ( sobs )

111
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,875
- THE THING THAT WAS
FULFILLING ME IS GONE.

112
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:46,916
DISAPPEARING.

113
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,250
- Yuji: IT WAS WRONG.

114
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,500
YOU CAN'T FILL YOURSELF
WITH MY MEMORIES.

115
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,666
RIGHT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,

116
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,166
- YOU'VE BEEN EMPTY.
- Hecate: HUH?

117
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,750
- ( grunts )

118
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,500
- WHAT? IT STOPPED.

119
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,333
- ARE YOU OKAY, SHANA?

120
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,708
- YEAH.

121
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:15,041
- I'M SORRY.
ALL OF THIS FOR ME.

122
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,208
- DON'T WORRY. THEY
ASKED ME TO BRING YOU BACK.

123
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,083
- HUH?

124
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:23,250
- THOSE TWO GUYS
AND KAZUMI YOSHIDA.

125
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:28,708
- ARE YOU SERIOUS? YOU MEAN
EVERYBODY WAS WORRIED ABOUT ME?

126
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:32,208
- MMM-HMM. BUT I WAS THE
ONE WHO WAS MOST WORRIED.

127
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,625
- SHANA.

128
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:47,208
- RIGHT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,
YOU'VE BEEN EMPTY.

129
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,458
- HUH?

130
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,375
- ( screams )

131
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,500
- Sydonay: HECATE!

132
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,916
- HEY, YOU! I THOUGHT WE
AGREED THERE'D BE NO QUITTING!

133
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,125
- ( screaming )

134
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,791
- OH, NO!

135
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,250
- WHAT THE...
- Tiamat: ABNORMAL SITUATION.

136
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,375
- ( screams )

137
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,958
- ALASTOR?

138
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,791
- Alastor: THE SUPREME THRONE
IS SPEWING FORTH

139
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,750
ALL THE POWER OF
EXISTENCE WITHIN HER.

140
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,416
BUT SHE CAN HOLD A TREMENDOUS
AMOUNT OF POWER.

141
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,041
- Yuji: THE CITY!

142
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,416
- ( grunts )

143
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,500
- Yuji: OH, NO.

144
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,208
- Alastor: WITH THIS MUCH
POWER FLOWING FREELY,

145
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,000
WAITING FOR IT TO
DISSIPATE NATURALLY

146
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,708
IS SIMPLY NOT FEASIBLE.

147
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,916
- Yuji: OH, NO.

148
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,166
- ( screams )

149
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,708
- OH, MY GOODNESS!
THIS IS SO EXCITING!

150
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,958
THE REALITY. THE DATA.
THE RESULTS!

151
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,208
FULLY SATURATED
POWER OF EXISTENCE,

152
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,375
EXCEEDING THE WORLD'S
NATURAL SAFETY LIMIT.

153
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,125
- Domino: WHAT'S GONNA
HAPPEN NOW?

154
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,875
- Professor: GOOD QUESTION.

155
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,833
WE'RE GONNA FIND
OUT PRETTY SOON.

156
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,750
- TIME TO MOVE ON.

157
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,000
- Alastor: THERE'S ONLY
ONE SOLUTION FOR THIS.

158
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,375
- HMM.
- REALLY?

159
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:40,250
- THE MANIFESTATION OF
ALASTOR, THE FLAME OF HEAVEN.

160
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,291
- Alastor: HMM.
- SO, THEN...

161
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,166
- ALASTOR WILL APPEAR IN
THE WORLD PHYSICALLY.

162
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,333
- Alastor: BEING ONE OF THE MOST
POWERFUL CRIMSON LORDS,

163
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:53,250
MY MANIFESTATION WILL CONSUME
A GREAT AMOUNT OF EXISTENCE.

164
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,208
IT SEEMS LIKELY MY MANIFESTATION

165
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,750
WILL ABSORB THE EXCESSIVE
AMOUNT OF POWER HERE,

166
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,000
AND AS A RESULT,
PUT A STOP TO THE CITY'S

167
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,750
IMPENDING DESTRUCTION.

168
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,125
- Yuji: THEN...

169
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,791
- Alastor: HOWEVER,
WHEN I MANIFEST,

170
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,541
THE FLAME HAZE WHICH
I OCCUPY IS DESTROYED.

171
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,041
THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE.

172
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,416
- BUT BY DESTROYED,
DO YOU MEAN...

173
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,125
- YES, I'LL DIE.

174
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,041
- ( Yuji gasps )

175
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,125
- IT IS THE DESTINY HANDED
TO THE FLAMING-HAIRED

176
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,791
BLAZING-EYED FLAME HAZE.

177
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,291
IT'S NOT A SURPRISE.

178
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,166
I KNEW THIS WHEN I ENTERED INTO
THE CONTRACT WITH ALASTOR.

179
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,541
- I'M GETTING A BAD
FEELING ABOUT THIS INDEED.

180
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,541
- Tiamat: HURRY.

181
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,750
- Shana: I SAVED YOU, YUJI...
AS SHANA.

182
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:47,375
NOW I HAVE TO CARRY OUT
MY MISSION AS A FLAME HAZE.

183
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,541
THAT'S WHO I AM.
BUT NOW...

184
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,375
- Alastor: YUJI SAKAI,

185
00:16:55,458 --> 00:17:00,333
UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE NO WAY
TO GET YOU TO SAFETY IN TIME.

186
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,041
- LET'S GO.

187
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,875
I DECIDED LONG AGO,
I'D GO WHERE YOU GO.

188
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,708
AND I STILL FEEL THAT WAY.

189
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:17,875
- YUJI.

190
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,000
- TENPAJYOSAI.

191
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,958
- I LOVE YOU, YUJI SAKAI.

192
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,458
- Wirhelmina: OH, NO!

193
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,750
- Tiamat: TENPAJYOSAI.

194
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:24,500
- NO! THE ENERGY IS DISSIPATING!

195
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,791
THERE'S ONLY ONE
THING LEFT TO DO!

196
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,375
- Professor: SKY!
- Domino: I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

197
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:34,791
- Professor: WE SHALL MOVE
ON TO OUR NEXT EXPERIMENT!

198
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,291
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU WANNA DIE?

199
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,791
- Marco: MOVE IT!

200
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:00,416
IF WE'RE ENGULFED BY THE FLAME
OF HEAVEN, WE'RE DONE FOR!

201
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,875
- NOTHING. I'M NOTHING.

202
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,625
- IT'S ALL RIGHT,
HECATE. BE CALM.

203
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,250
YOU ARE YOU.

204
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:02,875
- THAT LITTLE BRAT.

205
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,583
- Shana: WHAT?
- Yuji: SHANA.

206
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,333
- Shana: WHO IS THAT?
- Yuji: SHANA.

207
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,041
- Shana: YUJI? BUT WHY?

208
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,583
- Yuji: WAKE UP.
- Shana: WAKE UP?

209
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,125
BUT I'M NOT...

210
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,291
- Yuji: SHANA! SHANA!

211
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,375
THANK GOODNESS.

212
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,833
- WHY AM I STILL ALIVE?

213
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:07,875
- Alastor: YOUR BODY WAS ABLE TO
CONTAIN MY PHYSICAL EXISTENCE.

214
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:11,666
I'D SENSED THIS POSSIBILITY WHEN
WE'D FORGED OUR CONTRACT, BUT...

215
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,166
- Yuji: YOU'RE SAYING WE CAN
DO THIS ALL THE TIME?

216
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,333
- Alastor: DO NOT BE FOOLISH.
WE CAN'T RISK OUR LIVES

217
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,833
ON WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A LUCKY OCCURRENCE.

218
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,375
- NO WAY, I AM ALIVE.

219
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,708
- Yuji: MMMM-HMM.
AND ME, TOO.

220
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,791
- YUJI.

221
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,416
- ( gasps )

222
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,125
- Hmm?
- Yuji: UH, YOU'RE KIND OF...

223
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,166
- ( gasps )

224
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,708
- YOU WERE LOOKING!
- NO.

225
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,083
- YOU WERE LOOKING ALL RIGHT.
- I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

226
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,375
- THEN WHY'D YOU LOOK AWAY?

227
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,416
- WELL, BECAUSE...
- STOP LOOKING!

228
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,041
- SHANA, YOU MOVED!

229
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,916
- SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

230
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,416
- ( theme song playing )

231
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

232
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,625
- Yuji: HUH?

233
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,458
- Wirhelmina: EXCUSE ME FOR
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO, INDEED.

234
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:26,458
- WIRHELMINA.

235
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,625
Margery: THEY'RE PRETTY
LUCKY ALL RIGHT.

236
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:41,500
- Marco: OH, LOOK WHO'S TALKING.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

237
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,666
WE TAKE OFF FOR A LITTLE WHILE
AND ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.

238
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,375
- YOU'VE GOT A POINT.

239
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,875
I GUESS WE COULD
HANG OUT A LITTLE.

240
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:55,000
- ( Margery laughs )

241
00:22:55,083 --> 00:23:00,125
- Marco: YOU TWO HELP ME!
SHE'S SPINNING ME AROUND!

242
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,916
- ISN'T IT GREAT?
BIG SISTER'S GONNA STICK AROUND!

243
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,166
- I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A
GOOD THING OR A BAD THING.

244
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,791
- OH, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

245
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:09,500
BE MORE HONEST
WITH YOUR FEELINGS!

246
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,708
- SEE YOU LATER! BYE!

247
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:35,916
SHANA-CHAN, I'M SETTING A PLACE
FOR YOU, SO DROP BY FOR SUPPER!

248
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:00,250
- UH, HI.

249
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,416
- MORNING.

250
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,416
- HEY!
- MORNING!

251
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:13,333
- THIS SEMESTER,
YOU'VE GOT COMPETITION.

252
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,250
- IKE, WAIT A MINUTE!

253
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:26,208
- I AM NOT GONNA LOSE TO YOU.
- HUH?

254
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:28,916
- ROUND NUMBER TWO STARTS TODAY.

255
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,708
- WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

256
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:32,000
WHEN I BROUGHT YUJI BACK,

257
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:33,750
YOU THANKED ME WITH
TEARS IN YOUR EYES.

258
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:36,458
- AND THAT WAS
THE END OF ROUND ONE.

259
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:39,791
MAY THE BEST GIRL WIN. SEE YA!

260
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:44,000
- WELL, I'M NOT GONNA LOSE.
YOU CAN BET ON IT.

261
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,541
- Yuji: FOR NOW, WE'RE GONNA
LIVE OUR LIVES THE BEST WE CAN,

262
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:58,208
A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY FROM
WHERE THE WORLD IS DISPLACED.
