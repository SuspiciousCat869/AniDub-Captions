1
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,791
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,458
LIVES CONSUMED IN

3
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:39,541
SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.
NO ONE CAN TELL WHEN

4
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:42,583
THE WORLD IS DISPLACED,
AND THE FLAMES OF THE

5
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:45,250
CRIMSON WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

6
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:49,083
- ( theme song playing )

7
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:53,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

8
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:37,625
HESITATION AND MERCY ARE
UNNECESSARY PERSONA GOD VESSEL.

9
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:38,666
- Tiamat: UNDERSTOOD.

10
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,666
- NO DEFECTS
- Tiamat: CHECKED.

11
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,375
COMMENCE.

12
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,250
- DAMN!

13
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,791
- Tiamat: GOAL ACHIEVED.

14
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,375
- THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN
DO FROM HERE ON.

15
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,708
ALASTOR AND I WILL GO
AND TAKE CARE OF THE REST.

16
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,500
FIND THE MOST FLAWLESS AND
SUITABLE FLAME HAZE

17
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,666
THAT YOU CAN.

18
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,916
CONSIDER THIS THE FINAL
REQUEST OF A WOMAN

19
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,500
GETTING READY TO END HER LIFE.

20
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:19,666
FAREWELL WIRHELMINA, TIAMAT.

21
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,375
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

22
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,416
MAY FORTUNE AND GOOD LUCK
FOREVER SMILE UPON YOU.

23
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,125
- THOUSAND ORDINANCES.

24
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,583
THE FLAMING-HAIRED BLAZING-EYED
HUNTER'S CONTRACT

25
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,166
IS INDEED NOW IN EFFECT.

26
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,291
- Orgon: FLAMING-HAIR
BLAZING-EYES?

27
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,541
- HOWEVER, HER EXISTENCE
MUST BE KEPT A SECRET

28
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,208
UNTIL SHE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED
TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

29
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:49,125
OBVIOUSLY I CANNOT AFFORD TO
LET YOU ESCAPE THIS PALACE.

30
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,625
- Orgon: ESCAPE? YOU
CAN'T DEFEAT ME.

31
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,916
- YOU WILL BE FIGHTING
SOMEONE ELSE.

32
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,833
NEITHER I, NOR THE BLAZING-EYED
HUNTER WILL BE YOUR OPPONENT.

33
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,791
- Orgon: A RAINBOW?

34
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,500
- IT CAN'T BE.

35
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,250
IT...IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

36
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,458
RAINBOW WINGS, MERIHIM.

37
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,583
- IS THIS TO BE
MY TASK, THEN?

38
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,166
- YOUR SKILLS ARE RUSTY.

39
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,416
WE WOULD HAVE YOU PRACTICE
BEFORE THE GREAT BATTLE

40
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,375
THAT INDEED
FULFILLS YOUR PLEDGE.

41
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,166
- SO THIS TO GET ME
BACK INTO SHAPE?

42
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,875
LONG TIME NO SEE, ORGON

43
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,000
- Orgon: HOW?

44
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,875
- Shiro: YOU WILL BE
A WORTHY OPPONENT

45
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:53,583
ON WHICH TO TEST THE POWER
OF MY RAINBOW SKY SWORD.

46
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:54,958
- BUT... HOW?

47
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:58,291
- NOW. LET'S GET
STARTED. SHALL WE?

48
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,541
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

49
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,250
- DO YOU REMEMBER...

50
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,458
THAT DAY WHEN WE BEGAN
OUR CONTRACT?

51
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,166
IT HAD NOTHING TO
DO WITH FATE.

52
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,291
I CHOSE IT OF MY
OWN FREE WILL.

53
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:24,541
- Shana: I DECIDED THAT THIS IS
RIGHT FOR ME. THIS IS MY PATH.

54
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,625
- DAMMIT, THIS IS TOO MUCH.
I'VE GOTTA GET AWAY FROM HERE.

55
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,833
- I WILL FIGHT
THE MIGHTY WARRIOR.

56
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,916
- WAIT! NO! DON'T!

57
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,041
- ( screaming )

58
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,708
- I'M READY.

59
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,000
- MIGHTY WARRIOR.

60
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,208
- WATCH IT!

61
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,541
SAW IT!

62
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,208
- ( grunts )

63
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,916
I SAW THAT!

64
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,708
I CAN FEEL THE
STRENGTH WITHIN ME.

65
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,125
THIS, THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO
BE A FLAME HAZE.

66
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,333
IT'S INCREDIBLE!

67
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,416
I REALLY AM FIGHTING
FOR MY LIFE.

68
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:06,083
EVEN A MONSTER LIKE HIM HAS TO
HAVE SOME KIND OF WEAK POINT.

69
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,125
HOW'S THAT?

70
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,666
A LITTLE MORE
AND HE'S FINISHED.

71
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,833
- Alastor: GET AWAY.

72
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,791
- NO, I'M TRAPPED.

73
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,083
WHAT'S THIS?

74
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,833
- Alastor: YOUR NIGHT CAPE.

75
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:34,125
AN UNRESTRICTED METHOD IN
THE FORM OF A BLACK CLOAK.

76
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,666
IT IS THE GARMENT OF THE
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER.

77
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:44,833
- MY QUEST TO HAND OVER THE
BLADE TO A WORTHY WARRIOR...

78
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,875
TO THAT END, I BECAME
A MYSTES,

79
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,541
OF MY OWN FREE WILL.

80
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:51,875
- HUH?

81
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,333
- Alastor: A HUMAN CHOOSING
TO BECOME A MYSTES?

82
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,375
- WHY WOULD ANYONE DO THAT?

83
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,583
- MIGHTY WARRIOR,

84
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:04,791
I HAVE SEARCHED FOR A WARRIOR
POWERFUL ENOUGH TO WIELD ME.

85
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:09,708
TO THAT END, I BECAME A
MYSTES OF MY OWN FREE WILL.

86
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,333
- WIELD ME?
IS THE SWORD TALKING?

87
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:19,208
- Alastor: HMM, IT SEEMS THE
THREE SEPARATE SOULS HAVE MERGED

88
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,708
THE ARMORED WARRIOR,
THE WEAPON ITSELF,

89
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,791
AND THE SWORDSMITH
WHO FASHIONED IT.

90
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,250
- THIS WEAPON MUST GO TO THE
MIGHTY WARRIOR

91
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,416
WITH THE GREATEST SKILL.

92
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,791
THE NEITONO NO SHANA CARRIES
THE ESSENCE OF MY LIFE.

93
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:36,416
TO THAT END, I HAVE SEARCHED
FOR THE WARRIOR WHO IS WORTHY.

94
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,250
- Alastor: MADNESS.

95
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,916
YOU'RE SAYING YOU GAVE
UP YOUR HUMANITY

96
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,208
ALL FOR THE SAKE OF
FINDING THIS PERFECT WARRIOR.

97
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,833
- Shana: I GET IT.

98
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:54,416
YOU ARE THE SAME AS ME. YOU JUST
WANNA KNOW WHERE YOU BELONG,

99
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,375
AND YOU DECIDED TO GO OUT AND
FIND THAT PLACE ON YOUR OWN.

100
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,000
WELL YOU CAN STOP LOOKING.

101
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,916
THE MIGHTY WARRIOR
WHO WILL WIELD YOU

102
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,500
IS STANDING BEFORE YOU.

103
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,791
- MIGHTY WARRIOR,
PREPARE YOURSELF.

104
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,208
- ( grunting )

105
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,833
FOCUS EVERYTHING ON ONE BLOW.

106
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,250
- ( explosion )

107
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,375
- WILL YOU BE GOING NOW?

108
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,958
- IT IS NOT A MATTER FOR
DISCUSSION, WIRHELMINA CARMEL.

109
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:44,000
I MUST FULFILL MY PLEDGE TO
HER. THAT IS WHY I AM HERE.

110
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,041
IS IT NOT THE SAME FOR YOU?

111
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,416
NO, IT'S NOT. I CHOSE THIS.

112
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,166
- Alastor: CLEARLY YOU'RE
OVERDOING IT.

113
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,958
I JUST ACQUIRED YOU.

114
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,041
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED THAT I'M
GOING TO LOSE

115
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,000
MY FLAME-HAZE SO SOON.

116
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,250
- I WAS LUCKY TO SURVIVE THAT.

117
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,083
THAT WAS A HUNDRED TIMES MORE
DIFFICULT THAN MY TRAINING.

118
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,625
AND A THOUSAND TIMES
SCARIER THAN THAT DENIZEN.

119
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:44,958
- YOU THINK, IT'S OKAY?

120
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,458
- Alastor: IT IS YOUR
RESPONSIBILITY.

121
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:51,291
- HMM. I WILL TAKE IT.
THANK YOU.

122
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,166
OUR JOURNEY BEGINS TOGETHER.

123
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:06,125
- Bel Peol: AH, ONE OF THEM
HAS JUST BEEN DEFEATED.

124
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,333
HMM...

125
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,500
- HUH?

126
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,041
- Alastor: A GREAT
CATACLYSM IS AT HAND.

127
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,541
- HMM...

128
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,708
THE CRIMSON WORLD IS HERE.

129
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,916
SHIRO! GET READY ALASTOR!

130
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,416
- ( loud explosion )

131
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,916
- IT LOOKS LIKE I WIN.

132
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,916
THE WINNER CONTROLS
THE LOSER'S FATE.

133
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,708
NOT THE KIND OF POWER
YOU WANT TO GIVE THE WOMAN

134
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,875
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH.

135
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,875
PROMISE ME THREE THINGS.

136
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,666
YOU'LL NEVER CONSUME
ANOTHER PERSON,

137
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,250
YOU'LL NEVER BOTHER
THIS WORLD AGAIN.

138
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,958
AND THAT YOU'LL HELP
TRAIN THE NEXT

139
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,208
FLAME-HAIRED
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER.

140
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,250
DO IT TO THE VERY BEST
OF YOUR ABILITIES.

141
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,833
PLEASE, DO THIS FOR MY LOVE.

142
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,500
OUR LAST BATTLE WAS THE MOST
DIFFICULT AND MOST ENJOYABLE.

143
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,208
NO, I WON'T WAIT FOR YOU,

144
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,125
RAINBOW WINGS, MERIHIM.

145
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,666
THIS IS GOODBYE.

146
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,416
- I'VE LONGED FOR THIS,
FLAMING-HAIR BLAZING-EYES.

147
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,875
COME AT ME, FLAME HAZE.

148
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,875
- ( loud explosion )

149
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:26,666
- HMM?

150
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,833
- ( whimpering )

151
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,791
- DON'T TOUCH ME,
WIRHELMINA CARMEL.

152
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,541
- THERE IS A REASON WHY BOTH
OF US ARE STILL HERE.

153
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,666
WE ARE TO CARRY OUT
HER LAST WISH.

154
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,333
WE SHALL REMAIN HERE, TOGETHER,

155
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,833
FOR THAT REASON AND
THAT REASON ALONE.

156
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,083
- Wirhelmina: HE'S
SO IRRITATING.

157
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,333
RIGHT TO THE END,
HE GOT ON MY NERVES.

158
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,541
THAT HAPPENED SO LONG AGO.

159
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:48,750
INDEED, RIGHT NOW, MY SIGHTS
ARE SET ON A NEW ERA.

160
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,541
YES, A NEW ERA.

161
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,208
- ( swords clashing )

162
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,833
- ( grunting )

163
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,708
- TENMOKUIKKO'S STRENGTH
LAY WITHIN HIS SWORD.

164
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,500
HE WAS AN OPPONENT
AGAINST WHICH YOU

165
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,250
DID NOT NEED TO USE
UNRESTRICTED METHODS.

166
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:08,958
HOWEVER, AGAINST CRIMSON
DENIZENS, SUCH AS I,

167
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:12,583
YOUR OPPONENT'S ATTACKS WILL
NOT BE EVIDENT TO THE NAKED EYE.

168
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,166
LEARN TO KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN
WHILE SENSING THE CHANGES

169
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,750
IN THE POWER OF
EXISTENCE WITHIN.

170
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,875
YOU MUST BE ABLE TO
DETECT THE SIGN OF

171
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,291
AN UNRESTRICTED METHOD
BEING GENERATED.

172
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,791
- ( screams )

173
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:27,041
- THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU SHOULD
NEGLECT WHAT YOUR EYES TELL YOU.

174
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,833
AND MOST OF ALL,
NEVER FORGET THIS.

175
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,083
UNRESTRICTED METHODS
BY DENIZENS CAUSE

176
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,208
SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE SITUATIONS.

177
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,875
IT'S POINTLESS TO
BE SURPRISED.

178
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,416
FOCUS ON WHAT
IS ACTUALLY THERE.

179
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,458
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE ABLE TO
SEE US THROUGH OUR TECHNIQUES.

180
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,666
FOR THEY DEFINE US.
THAT IS HOW WE,

181
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,166
CRIMSON DENIZENS,
DO BATTLE WITH OTHERS.

182
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,208
THE TIME FOR TALKING IS PASSED.

183
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,708
- ( gasps )

184
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,916
- HERE I COME!

185
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,916
- ( inaudible )

186
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:48,375
- WIRHELMINA...

187
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:51,166
- A WHOLE NEW ERA
AWAITS YOU INDEED.

188
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,500
- WELL THEN, IT'S INDEED
TIME WE SAY OUR GOODBYES.

189
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,291
- Alastor: THANK YOU
FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE.

190
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,791
- NO NEED TO THANK ME.

191
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:28,083
- AREN'T YOU COMING WITH US?

192
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,291
- IF I JOIN YOU, ALL
MY EFFORTS UP 'TIL NOW

193
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,791
WILL HAVE BEEN WASTED.

194
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,708
- BUT...

195
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,500
- INDEED, FROM NOW
ON YOU'LL HAVE TO DO

196
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,958
EVERYTHING ON YOUR
OWN WITHOUT MY HELP.

197
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:42,125
I KNOW YOU'LL BE
JUST FINE ON YOUR OWN.

198
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,416
FORGIVE ME FOR INSISTING
IT BE THIS WAY.

199
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,125
AS LONG AS YOU ACT AS
WE HAVE TAUGHT YOU,

200
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,625
YOU'LL HAVE NO REAL PROBLEMS.

201
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,625
BESIDES, THE FLAME OF HEAVEN
IS WITH YOU NOW.

202
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,833
YOU INDEED HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

203
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,875
- Tiamat: YOU ARE READY.

204
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,208
- Wirhelmina: OH.

205
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,833
- ( sobs )

206
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,166
- OH, WIRHELMINA!

207
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,916
- I WILL BE THERE TO
WATCH OVER YOU,

208
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,916
SO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
EAT TOO MANY SWEETS.

209
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,375
INDEED, ONE LAST HUG
BEFORE YOU GO.

210
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:38,833
- ( sobs )

211
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,708
- HEY, SHANA.

212
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,958
WHY DO YOU LOVE
MELON BREAD SO MUCH?

213
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,750
- WELL, YOU SEE...
- YEAH, GO ON.

214
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,208
IT'S A SECRET.

215
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:17,125
- ( laughing )

216
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:20,125
- UH, WAIT A MINUTE!

217
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,541
- SHANA, WAIT!
- Shana: FORGET IT!

218
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,125
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN FORGET IT?

219
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,250
- ( theme song playing )

220
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,208
- ( singing in Japanese )

221
00:24:57,041 --> 00:25:00,958
- Yuji: A TUNER BY THE NAME
KHAMSIN ARRIVES IN MISAKI CITY.

222
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,916
THE BALL MASQUE
FINALLY MAKES ITS MOVE.

223
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,833
AND THE GIRL WITH FEELINGS FOR
YUJI LEARNS OF THE REAL WORLD.

224
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:10,083
NEXT EPISODE, "A NEW CHAPTER."
