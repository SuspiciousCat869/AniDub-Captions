1
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,791
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,416
LIVES CONSUMED IN

3
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,625
SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.
NO ONE CAN TELL WHEN

4
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,500
THE WORLD IS DISPLACED,
AND THE FLAMES OF THE

5
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:45,708
CRIMSON WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

6
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,958
- ( theme song playing )

7
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:50,208
- ( singing in Japanese )

8
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,833
Yoshida: THE WAY THE
WORLD REALLY IS.

9
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,666
- Khmasin: I WILL LEND YOU
THAT MONOCLE.

10
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,166
PLEASE CONFIRM FOR YOURSELF
WHETHER OR NOT

11
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,250
THE PERSON YOU KNOW AS YUJI
SAKAI IS INDEED A TORCH.

12
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,916
I'M GOING TO NEED
YOUR COOPERATION,

13
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,708
AND THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT
IN YOUR PRESENT STATE.

14
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,708
- Behemoth: YOUNG LADY,

15
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,750
IT IS CRUCIAL TO HAVE SOMEONE
LIKE YOU WHO IS BORN

16
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,625
AND RAISED IN THE CITY,

17
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:02,125
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS IT
AND HOLDS IT IN HER HEART.

18
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,875
- Yoshida: IF SAKAI IS A TORCH,

19
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,166
THEN ONE DAY...

20
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:12,083
HE'S JUST FINE.
I'M SURE HE'S NOT A TORCH.

21
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,416
AND AT THE FESTIVAL TOMORROW,

22
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,875
I'M GONNA TELL HIM
THAT I LOVE HIM.

23
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,458
- Shana: THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD
CHANCE THE BALL MASQUE

24
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:39,125
IS GOING TO COME TO THIS
CITY LOOKING FOR YOU, YUJI.

25
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,291
THIS PLACE IS
ALREADY UNBALANCED,

26
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:45,000
SO WE COULD HAVE A REAL
PROBLEM ON OUR HANDS.

27
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,916
- Yuji: I CAN'T STAY IN THIS
CITY FOR MUCH LONGER,

28
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,958
REGARDLESS OF WHAT
THE BALL MASQUE DOES.

29
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,791
I'M NO LONGER HUMAN,

30
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,791
AND ONE OF THESE DAYS,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE

31
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,541
TO MOM AND EVERYONE ANYWAY.

32
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,916
BUT I WANNA STAY JUST
A LITTLE LONGER,

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,041
HANG ON A LITTLE WHILE.

34
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:07,416
- Shana: I'M GONNA WEAR A YUKATA
TOMORROW AND SURPRISE YUJI.

35
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,958
AND THEN WE'LL GO TO
THE FESTIVAL TOGETHER.

36
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,666
- ( giggles )

37
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,083
JUST LIKE THE DAY WE FINALLY
LEAVE THIS CITY,

38
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,875
WE'LL BE TOGETHER.

39
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,958
- Margery: WHAT? YOU BOTH
WANNA COME WITH ME

40
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,583
WHEN I DECIDE TO
LEAVE THIS PLACE?

41
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,125
- Marco: ( chuckles )
THESE GUYS MUST BE TOTALLY

42
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,583
INFATUATED WITH YOU.

43
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,458
OW!

44
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,416
- Margery: DO YOU TWO
REALLY UNDERSTAND

45
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,375
WHAT YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT HERE?

46
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:37,208
- Sato: OF COURSE WE DO.
- I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT.

47
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,875
- ( grunting )

48
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,833
- WHAT YOU GUYS ARE TRYING
TO ACHIEVE IS RIGHT HERE.

49
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,666
- I GET IT.

50
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,750
ONCE WE GET GOOD ENOUGH WITH IT,
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE US WITH YOU.

51
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:11,916
AM I RIGHT?

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,416
- YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHEN
YOU GIVE IT A TRY.

53
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,791
- ALRIGHT!

54
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,916
- ( grunting )

55
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,333
- TANAKA!

56
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,625
- YOU THINK MAYBE THIS IS SOME
KINDA SUBTLE HINT

57
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,041
THAT SHE DOESN'T WANT
US TO COME ALONG?

58
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,083
- Marco: THIS ISN'T LIKE YOU.

59
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,250
- REALLY?

60
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,875
- USUALLY YOU JUST PUNCH
THEM IN THE FACE.

61
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,375
( laughs ) IT'S SO UNEXPECTED.

62
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,083
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED TO FIND
IT RAINING BOOZE TOMORROW.

63
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,916
- ( Marco screams)

64
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,333
- Girl: HEY, YOU WEARING YOUR
YUKATA TO THE FESTIVAL?

65
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,500
- OH YEAH, ESPECIALLY
SINCE I JUST BOUGHT A NEW ONE.

66
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:15,041
- Alastor: I'M TALKING ABOUT
LEAVING THE CITY.

67
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,583
- Yoshida: I'M STILL AFRAID.

68
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,708
I'M STILL TOO AFRAID.

69
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,666
- YOSHIDA!

70
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,250
HEY IF IT'S OKAY, I'LL MEET YOU
ON THE BRIDGE AT 5 O'CLOCK.

71
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,000
- YEAH, SURE, THAT'S JUST FINE.

72
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:53,333
- Behemoth: HMM, I WONDER
HOW THAT GIRL IS DOING.

73
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:58,083
I CAN ONLY HOPE THIS YUJI SAKAI
OF HERS IS NOT A TORCH.

74
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:01,791
- Khamsin: AND I HOPE SHE CALMS
DOWN ENOUGH TO BE OF USE TO US.

75
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,875
IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT OF
WORK TO TUNE THIS CITY.

76
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:09,458
- Behemoth: INDEED. THE
DISTORTION IS UNUSUALLY LARGE.

77
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,291
- Khamsin: WELL, WE SHOULD
MARK THIS AREA AS WELL.

78
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,208
- ( grunts )

79
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,916
JUST A FEW MORE AND WE SHOULD
HAVE ENOUGH FOR THE TUNING.

80
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,625
HOWEVER, I'M SENSING
SOMETHING STRANGE HERE,

81
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,583
AND IT'S NOT THE DISTORTION.

82
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:30,708
- Behemoth: HMM.

83
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,958
- ( Professor chuckling )

84
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,458
THINGS ARE PROGRESSING
RATHER NICELY.

85
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,666
IN FACT, I'D SAY
THEY'RE JUST PERFECT.

86
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,541
DO YOU CONCUR, DOMINO?

87
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:45,750
- Domino: ABSOLUTELY,

88
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,333
SIX HOURS 14 MINUTES
AND 32 SECONDS

89
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,125
UNTIL PREPARATIONS ARE COMPLETE!

90
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,125
- OH WHAT A GRAND
TIME WE'LL HAVE.

91
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:02,333
- JUST AS I THOUGHT,
THIS PATTERN REALLY SUITS YOU.

92
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,083
YU-CHAN IS GOING TO STOP DEAD
IN HIS TRACKS

93
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,000
WHEN HE SEES HOW
PRETTY YOU LOOK.

94
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,041
BUT HE SEEMS TO BE
RUNNING A LITTLE LATE.

95
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,750
- Yuji: I THOUGHT I WAS READY
TO LEAVE THIS CITY,

96
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,250
BUT IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

97
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,375
WHAT? IT'S LATER THAN I THOUGHT.

98
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,750
- ( running footsteps )

99
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,541
- SORRY YOSHIDA,
DID YOU WAIT LONG?

100
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,708
- UH, NO, NOT AT ALL.

101
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,791
- SHALL WE GO?
- OKAY.

102
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:16,125
- I WONDER WHAT'S TAKING
YU-CHAN SO LONG.

103
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,083
HE TRAINS WITH YOU EVERY
SATURDAY AFTERNOON,

104
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,708
SO HE SHOULD HAVE
BEEN HOME EARLY THEN.

105
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,125
- I TOLD HIM WE'D TRAIN
IN THE EVENING TODAY.

106
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,708
- OH!

107
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,791
- IT'S OKAY, I DIDN'T TELL HIM
WE WERE GOING TO THE FESTIVAL.

108
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,208
- I SEE.

109
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,833
THEN IN THAT CASE,

110
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,791
MAYBE HE STOPPED OFF
SOMEWHERE ON HIS WAY HOME.

111
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,083
- STOPPED OFF SOMEWHERE?

112
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,166
- WHAT DO YOU SAY
THE TWO OF US GO OUT

113
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,041
AND LOOK FOR HIM, SHANA-CHAN.

114
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:48,208
HE COULD BE HANGING OUT WITH IKE
AND HIS FRIENDS AT THE FESTIVAL.

115
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,250
WE'LL LEAVE A NOTE EXPLAINING
WHERE WE ARE,

116
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,791
IN CASE HE COMES HOME.

117
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,208
- BUT...

118
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,291
- I IMAGINE YU-CHAN WOULD BE
EVEN MORE SURPRISED

119
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,458
IF WE JUST HAPPENED
TO RUN INTO HIM.

120
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,166
- HUH?
- RIGHT?

121
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,791
- WHOA.

122
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:19,083
- LOOK OVER THERE, SHANA-CHAN,
THEY HAVE CANDY APPLES.

123
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:22,666
YU-CHAN ALWAYS HAS ONE WHEN
HE COMES TO THE FESTIVAL.

124
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,416
- WANNA TRY ONE?
- OKAY.

125
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:29,583
- SOMETHING WRONG?
DO YOU SEE HIM?

126
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,375
- NO, IT'S SOMEONE ELSE,
BUT IT'S OKAY.

127
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,291
- Tanaka: PLEASE, BIG SISTER,

128
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,208
YOU'RE INTERRUPTING
OUR TRAINING.

129
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:45,125
THIS ISN'T THE TIME TO
COME TO A FESTIVAL.

130
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,333
- Margery: OH, SHUT UP.

131
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,041
WHEN A WOMAN SAYS SHE
WANTS TO GO OUT,

132
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,541
IT'S A MAN'S JOB
TO ACCOMPANY HER.

133
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,541
- Marco: ALSO, ANY
MORE TRAINING

134
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:53,916
AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ENDED UP
TURNING EACH OTHER

135
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,916
INTO PLATES OF HUMAN SASHIMI.

136
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,208
- ( Marco laughs )

137
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,500
- Margery: EITA, BUY ME
SOMETHING WITH ALCOHOL.

138
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,958
- WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA DRINK?

139
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:05,416
- IS THAT GONNA BE A PROBLEM?
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

140
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,083
- GOOD.

141
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,208
- OGA-CHAN, LET'S GO.

142
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,083
- RIGHT.

143
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,833
- Yuji: WOW, LOOK
AT ALL THE BOOTHS.

144
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,791
HEY, KEEP AN EYE OUT
FOR CANDY APPLES.

145
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,500
- I DO WANNA FIND OUT
IF SAKAI'S ALRIGHT,

146
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,083
BUT I'M AFRAID.

147
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,583
BUT I THINK NOT KNOWING
IS EVEN WORSE.

148
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,458
- WELL, I SUPPOSE ALL WE CAN DO
NOW IS WAIT FOR THAT GIRL

149
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,750
TO COOPERATE WITH US.

150
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,625
- Behemoth: HMM,

151
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,416
BUT THIS ODD FEELING
CONCERNS ME.

152
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,833
IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE OF
THE DISTORTION.

153
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,833
- THERE ARE NO INDICATIONS
OF ANY DENIZENS PRESENT.

154
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,583
AND THERE'S NOTHING WE
CAN DO ABOUT IT ANYWAY.

155
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:03,750
- Behemoth: HMM.

156
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,416
- Professor: YOU KNOW,

157
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,166
HUMANS ARE SO EASY
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF.

158
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,958
ALL OF THOSE FLAME HAZES,

159
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,500
AND NOT EVEN ONE OF THEM
HAS DETECTED US.

160
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,375
- Domino: PROFESSOR,
PREPARATIONS ARE COMPLETE!

161
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,041
- EXCELLENT!

162
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:27,291
- HE'S FINE.
I'M SURE HE'S JUST FINE.

163
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,916
AND THEN, I'M GONNA
TELL HIM THAT I LOVE HIM.

164
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,250
- START THE EXPERIMENT!
- Domino: OKIE DOKIE!

165
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,958
- ( gasps )

166
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,375
- BUT HOW?

167
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,708
I DIDN'T SENSE IT UNTIL
RIGHT THIS MOMENT.

168
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,208
- Chigusa: SHANA-CHAN,
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

169
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,833
- I FORGOT THERE'S
SOMETHING I HAVE TO DO.

170
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:21,000
PLEASE, GO ON WITHOUT ME.
PLEASE, GO ON.

171
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,708
- IS IT A DENIZEN?

172
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,750
- Marco: SEEMS THAT WAY, BUT
HOW COME WE'RE ONLY SENSING

173
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,458
THE UNRESTRICTED SYSTEM?

174
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,708
- IT MUST BE OFF,
HIDING SOMEWHERE.

175
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,541
ANYWAY, THE FESTIVITIES
ARE OVER FOR US.

176
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:38,208
- I GUESS THAT MEANS WE SHOULD
HEAD OVER TO THE CRYSTAL ALTAR.

177
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,583
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FIND
THAT DENIZON FOR YOU, RIGHT?

178
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,833
- Marco: IT'S BECOMING SECOND
NATURE TO YOU GUYS.

179
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,750
- YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO
WHEN YOU GET THERE, RIGHT?

180
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:54,208
- Sato: YOU BET.
- Tanaka: YOU BET.

181
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,041
- Marco: HEY, YOU'RE NOT
ACTUALLY THINKING

182
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,083
ABOUT BRINGING THEM
ALONG, ARE YOU?

183
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,625
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

184
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:03,083
I'M JUST TAKING ADVANTAGE OF
THEM WHILE I CAN, LIKE ALWAYS.

185
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,375
- WE NEED THE CRYSTAL
ALTAR FOR THE SEARCH.

186
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,583
- Marco: IN THAT CASE, ALRIGHT.

187
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,916
- WE'RE DEALING WITH AN
UNRESTRICTED SYSTEM

188
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
HERE THAT'S
VERY SOPHISTICATED.

189
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,250
- Alastor: IT WAS CLEARLY
FASHIONED BY SOMEONE

190
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,625
OF GREAT SKILL.

191
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,833
- YUJI MUST'VE SEEN IT BY NOW.
WHERE IS HE?

192
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,041
- A DENIZEN!
I HAVE TO FIND SHANA.

193
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,500
HEY YOSHIDA?

194
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,208
YOSHIDA, ARE YOU...

195
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,208
- HE CAN'T BE.

196
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:43,416
- NOT SAKAI.
- YOSHIDA, WHAT'S WRONG?

197
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,458
THIS IS A TREASURE. OH NO!

198
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,541
- YUJI!

199
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,458
KAZUMI YOSHIDA.

200
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,291
WHY? WHY WOULD SHE BE WITH YUJI?

201
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,833
IT CAN'T BE.

202
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,291
IT CAN'T!

203
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,416
- HEY, YOSHIDA!

204
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,708
- ( groans )

205
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:26,875
- SHANA?

206
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,916
- WHY WAS SHE HERE, YUJI?

207
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,791
- LISTEN, I THINK THAT YOSHIDA
FOUND OUT THAT I'M A TORCH.

208
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,750
I HAVE TO GO AFTER HER.

209
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,916
SHE WAS UPSET AND CRYING.
I CAN'T LEAVE HER LIKE THIS.

210
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,833
- WHY CAN'T YOU JUST IGNORE HER?

211
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,458
- IGNORE HER?

212
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:49,000
- SHANA.
- JUST IGNORE HER!

213
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:52,250
ARE YOU BLIND? THERE'S A
DENIZEN ON THE LOOSE HERE.

214
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,416
- I KNOW, BUT...

215
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
I HAVE TO GO AND
TALK TO HER PROPERLY.

216
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,708
- NO, YOU HAVE TO
BE WITH ME, YUJI.

217
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,958
FORGET ABOUT TALKING
TO KAZUMI YOSHIDA.

218
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,916
- IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

219
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,041
- STOP IT, LEAVE HER ALONE!
SHE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH US!

220
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,750
- NOTHING TO DO WITH...

221
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,458
- YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE.

222
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,500
KAZUMI YOSHIDA HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH US.

223
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,208
SHE DOESN'T MATTER TO US.

224
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,833
- SHANA!

225
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,500
I NEVER EXPECTED YOU TO
SAY THOSE THINGS, SHANA.

226
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,833
WELL, SHE DOES MATTER TO ME.

227
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,000
- YUJI!

228
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,208
- YOSHIDA!

229
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,875
- YUJI.

230
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,458
- EXCUSE ME, ARE YOU OKAY?
WHERE DOES IT HURT?

231
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,166
- Alastor: SHANA.

232
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:10,750
- YUJI.

233
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,583
YUJI.

234
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,625
YUJI.

235
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,083
- Khamsin: LOOK AT IT.

236
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,666
OH, SO IT'S YOU I SEE.

237
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,166
- Alastor: MOBILIZER OF
CEREMONIAL EQUIPMENT,

238
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,916
IT WAS YOU TWO!

239
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,416
- Behemoth: IT'S BEEN A WHILE,
FLAME OF HEAVEN.

240
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,166
- WELL THEN, I TAKE IT YOU
HAVE SEEN THE SYSTEM.

241
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,541
- Margery: MARCOSIAS, I'M
GETTING A BAD FEELING

242
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,125
ABOUT THIS CRAZY SYSTEM.

243
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,083
- Marco: YEAH, IT'S DANTALIAN,
THE SEEKER.

244
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:02,291
THIS HAS TO BE THE WORK OF
THAT WHACKED OUT PROFESSOR.

245
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,375
BUT I HAVEN'T PICKED UP
HIS PRESENCE ANYWHERE.

246
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,458
- ANOTHER REASON WHY WE
NEED THE CRYSTAL ALTAR.

247
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:11,250
KEISAKU, EITA, HURRY UP.

248
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,583
- WHERE THE HELL DID TANAKA
GET TO? IS HE LOST?

249
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,416
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING, OGA-CHAN?

250
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,708
- PLEASE, I'M IN A HURRY.

251
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,958
- FORGET IT, NOT UNTIL YOU TELL
ME ALL ABOUT THAT WOMAN

252
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,208
YOU WERE
HANGING AROUND WITH.

253
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,833
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU,
SHE'S AN ACQUAINTANCE.

254
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,083
- IS THAT THE TRUTH?
- YES.

255
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,125
AND I REALLY AM IN A HURRY.
LET ME GO.

256
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,375
- YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT.
YOU'RE LYING TO ME.

257
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,291
- WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE REALLY
STARTING TO GET ON MY NERVES.

258
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,375
WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT
TO ASK ME THIS STUFF?

259
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,125
- BECAUSE,

260
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,791
I FEEL, A LITTLE JEALOUS.

261
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,291
- WHATEVER, LOOK I
HAVE TO GET GOING.

262
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,875
- SHE MAKES ME JEALOUS.

263
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,083
- WHAT?

264
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,250
- SHE MAKES ME REALLY JEALOUS.

265
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,125
- WHY WOULD YOU BE JEALOUS?

266
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,833
- SHE MAKES ME JEALOUS,

267
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,166
BECAUSE I'M IN LOVE WITH
YOU EITA TANAKA.

268
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,958
YOU GET IT NOW?

269
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,166
- UH...

270
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:16,916
- ( groans )

271
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,166
- SAKAI IS A TORCH.

272
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,625
HE'S DEAD.

273
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:36,000
- YOSHIDA. WHO WOULD'VE GIVEN
YOU SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

274
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:58,791
- Alastor: GATHER YOURSELF!
A DENIZEN HAS BEGUN HIS ATTACK.

275
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,541
- SORRY.

276
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,416
- LET'S GET BACK TO THE
MATTER AT HAND, SHALL WE?

277
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,916
THIS UNRESTRICTED SYSTEM
IS MAKING THINGS WORSE.

278
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,500
IF IT KEEPS UP, THE DISTORTION
WILL BE TOO LARGE TO REPAIR,

279
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,916
AND THE WHOLE CITY
WILL BE ENGULFED.

280
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,125
- Alastor: WHAT IS ITS PURPOSE?
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO?

281
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,833
- Khamsin: YES, WE NEED
TO BEGIN THE TUNING.

282
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:34,000
WE'VE ALREADY LAID DOWN
THE NECESSARY MARKINGS.

283
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,416
ALL WE NEED NOW IS THE HELP
OF A PERSON WHO HOLDS

284
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,666
THE TRUE IMAGE OF THE
CITY IN THEIR MIND.

285
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,250
- Behemoth: ACTUALLY, WE
DID FIND SOMEONE, BUT

286
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,708
WE'VE RUN INTO A BIT
OF A PROBLEM WITH HER.

287
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,791
A YOUNG WOMAN
NAMED KAZUMI YOSHIDA.

288
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:51,291
- OH, I TAKE IT YOU KNOW HER.

289
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,958
AH, YOU MUST BE THE CAUSE
OF THE STRANGE FEELING

290
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,541
I PICKED UP FROM HER.

291
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,791
AS SOON AS SHE SHOWS UP, WE CAN
BEGIN THE ACTUAL TUNING PROCESS.

292
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,625
- AS YOU WISH,
I'LL GO AND BRING HER HERE.

293
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,250
- Alastor: WILL YOU BE OKAY?

294
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,625
- I'LL BE FINE.

295
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,041
I WILL FULFILL MY MISSION
AS A FLAME HAZE.

296
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,833
IT HURTS.

297
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,083
- Professor: RIGHT ABOUT NOW IS
WHEN THE FLAME HAZES

298
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,666
START MEDDLING
WITH MY PLANS.

299
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,666
OH DOMINO,

300
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,625
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT!

301
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:34,750
- Domino: YES! IT'S TIME TO
BEGIN THE SECOND PHASE!

302
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,666
- ( people screaming )

303
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,416
- BE SEALED!

304
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,333
- OGA-CHAN.

305
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,416
- I'M SORRY.

306
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,125
I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT.

307
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,833
I CAN'T GIVE YOU AN
ANSWER RIGHT NOW,

308
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,375
BUT I'LL COME BACK LATER
AND TAKE CARE OF THIS.

309
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:31,541
- SATO! HOW CAN HE MOVE
AROUND INSIDE THE SEAL?

310
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,625
THIS IS BAD. I'VE GOTTA
