1
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,750
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:38,125
LIVES CONSUMED
IN SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.

3
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:41,208
NO ONE CAN TELL
WHEN THE WORLD IS DISPLACED

4
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:45,916
AND THE FLAMES OF THE
CRIMSON WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,916
- ( theme music playing )

6
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,291
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

7
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,000
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE ME
THANK YOU, ARE YOU?

8
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,250
- DON'T BOTHER.
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING

9
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,750
TO BRING THAT STUPID FIGHT
TO AN END.

10
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,791
OH MY, DID I UPSET YOU?

11
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:33,416
- SOMEDAY YOU AND I ARE GONNA
SETTLE THIS, ONCE AND FOR ALL.

12
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:48,000
- Yuji: SHE WAS THE FIRST FLAME
I'D SEEN, OTHER THAN SHANA.

13
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,625
THEY'RE SO DIFFERENT.

14
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:54,458
- HMM, YOU'VE CHANGED
SINCE WE LAST MET.

15
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,041
YOU'RE STILL FULL OF ENERGY,

16
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,916
EVEN THOUGH YOU JUST FOUGHT
A TOUGH BATTLE.

17
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,291
- Marco: OOH, GREAT!
WE LOVE A GOOD FIGHT.  HOO!

18
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,125
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

19
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:06,000
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE OUT OF TIME.

20
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:09,791
OUR TOP PRIORITY HAS SET OFF
ONE OF OUR TRIP-WIRES.

21
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,875
- ( Marco laughing )
I KNEW HE'D MAKE HIS MOVE

22
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,958
WITH ALL THIS COMMOTION.

23
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:18,250
- I'LL PLAY WITH YOU
SOME OTHER TIME, LITTLE GIRL.

24
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,083
- Alastor: WAIT, IF YOU'RE GOING
AFTER THE CORPSE COLLECTOR,

25
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,875
HE HASN'T DONE ANY HARM.

26
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,791
- THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS AN INNOCENT DENIZEN.

27
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,666
- Marco: WE'RE JUST GONNA
GO BLAST HIM AND SMASH HIM.

28
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,875
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

29
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,291
- HMM.

30
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,458
- Alastor: LET THEM GO.

31
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:45,500
YOU DON'T WANT TO FACE THEM SO
SOON AFTER YOU'VE JUST FOUGHT.

32
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,375
LET THEM CHASE AFTER HIM.

33
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:51,375
THE CORPSE COLLECTOR
WON'T BE CAUGHT THAT EASILY.

34
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,958
- Yuji: IT'S PRETTY SURPRISING.

35
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,125
YOU'RE BOTH FLAME HAZES, BUT YOU
TWO COULDN'T BE MORE DIFFERENT.

36
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,083
SHE'S KINDA LIKE A KNIFE
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

37
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,125
- WELL, COMPARED TO HER,
A KNIFE IS PRETTY CUTE.

38
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:15,750
- Alastor: THERE'S NO DOUBT,
SHE'S A UNIQUE CASE.

39
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,000
HER HATRED FOR DENIZENS
FAR OUTWEIGHS

40
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,541
HER DUTY TO KEEP THE BALANCE.

41
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:20,875
- HATRED?

42
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,458
- Alastor: BASICALLY, HUMANS
BECOME FLAME HAZES

43
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,041
AS A RESULT OF INJURIES
OR TRAGEDIES SUFFERED

44
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,625
AT THE HANDS OF A DENIZEN.

45
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,708
HATRED AND A DESIRE FOR REVENGE

46
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,791
ARE HER SOLE REASONS
FOR FIGHTING.

47
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,208
- WHAT ABOUT SHANA?

48
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,541
- Alastor: SHE IS ALSO UNIQUE,
BUT IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

49
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,583
SHE'S LIKELY
THE ONLY FLAME HAZE

50
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:41,250
WHO DOESN'T HARBOR SOME KIND
OF GRUDGE AGAINST DENIZENS.

51
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,416
- I SEE.
- WHAT?

52
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,041
- LISTEN, COULD YOU TEACH ME
HOW TO FIGHT?

53
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,750
- TEACH YOU?

54
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,041
- WE WERE ABLE TO PUT A STOP
TO THE CITY DEVOURING,

55
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,666
BUT WHAT DO WE DO IF MORE
CRIMSON DENIZENS

56
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,958
SHOW UP ALL OF A SUDDEN?

57
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,166
SO I THOUGHT
WITH A LITTLE HARD WORK,

58
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,208
I COULD TRAIN
AND HELP YOU OUT.

59
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,750
- YOU WANNA FIGHT TOGETHER?
- WHY NOT?

60
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:05,625
- HUH.  I GUESS
WE COULD GIVE IT A TRY.

61
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,541
- YOU UPSET?

62
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,791
- I'M NOT UPSET, YUJI.

63
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,083
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

64
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:15,208
WHY ARE YOU RUNNING OFF?

65
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:19,958
- I FEEL LIKE I CAN DO ANYTHING,
AS LONG AS I'M WITH YUJI.

66
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,875
- I'M HERE, BUT ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS WHERE IT HAPPENED?

67
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,166
- Tanaka: THAT'S THE PLACE,
I'M POSITIVE.

68
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,208
- Margery: WELL, I'M LOOKING,

69
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,125
BUT THERE'S NO SIGN
OF HIM HERE NOW.

70
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:35,625
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
- ANY SIGN OF HIS FLAME?

71
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,416
- NOT ANYMORE, THERE ISN'T.

72
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,083
- ( sighs )
- Marco: HE'S A SLIPPERY ONE.

73
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:46,291
HE PROBABLY REALIZED HE WALKED
INTO AN UNRESTRICTED METHOD

74
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,583
AND THEN FLED
INTO A CROWD SOMEWHERE.

75
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,208
- Margery:
EVEN SO, I CAN'T BELIEVE

76
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,458
HOW FAST HE'S MOVING
AROUND DOWN THERE.

77
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,416
USUALLY I CAN PICK UP MOTION
WAVES FROM THAT KIND OF POWER.

78
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,291
- Marco: WELL, IT'S A GOOD
THING WE WERE ABLE

79
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,666
TO SEAL THIS WHOLE CITY

80
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,041
WHILE THE BLAZING-EYED MISSY
WAS KICKING UP A FUSS.

81
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,791
BUT I'M SURE
WE'LL EVENTUALLY RUN INTO HIM.

82
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,916
- GET WITH IT, WILL YOU?

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,333
THIS SEAL ISN'T GONNA
LAST FOREVER, YOU KNOW.

84
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,166
KEEP TALKING LIKE THAT
AND HE'S GONNA GET AWAY AGAIN.

85
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,125
- Marco: IF THAT HAPPENS,
THEN WE MAY EVEN SEE

86
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,416
A FEW TEARS FROM THE CHANTER
OF ELEGIES.  HA!  OW!

87
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,458
- I THOUGHT I WAS SO CLEVER
LURING THEM HERE,

88
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,291
BUT NOW IT SEEMS AS IF
I'VE ONLY TRAPPED MYSELF.

89
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,583
THIS WILL BE A TEST
OF PATIENCE.

90
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,333
- ( boys shouting )

91
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:31,750
- DAMN THAT CORPSE-COLLECTOR
SON A BITCH!

92
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:36,250
RUNNIN' AND ACTIN'
LIKE A COCKROACH.  AH!

93
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,833
WHAT TRICK IS THAT BASTARD
USING TO MOVE?

94
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,791
EITA, KEISAKU,
YOU'RE FLAME HAZES NOW,

95
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,250
SO YOU GOTTA LEARN
TO KEEP A CLOSER EYE ON HIM.

96
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:48,083
- SORRY. I'LL BE MORE CAREFUL.
- ( Margery squealing )

97
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:51,333
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WE'RE NOT FLAME HAZES.

98
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:54,541
- I WANNA HELP BIG SISTER OUT,
SO I'M PRETENDING TO BE ONE.

99
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,333
- REALLY?

100
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,041
- Marco: STOP IT!  HEY!
LET ME DOWN!

101
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:02,250
- YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN, DUDE.
- SORRY.

102
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,833
- Marco:
WHAT?  COME ON!

103
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,083
- I SAY WHAT'S THE POINT
IN DRINKING

104
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:09,166
UNLESS YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME
AND JUST GO NUTS?

105
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:15,916
TOMORROW WE'LL WRITE
TOMORROW'S POETRY.

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
IF THAT CAN BE DONE,
THEN THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

107
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,791
( laughing )

108
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,041
- SHE'S DOWN.
ARE YOU OKAY, BIG SISTER?

109
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:30,125
- Marco: SHE'S ALL RIGHT.
THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

110
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,291
- I THOUGHT SHE COULD
HOLD HER LIQUOR.

111
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,208
- Marco: SHE'S ACTUALLY
NOT THAT MUCH OF A DRINKER.

112
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,041
SOMETIMES SHE JUST FEELS
THE NEED.

113
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,875
- YOU TOLD US THAT FLAME HAZES
WERE AVENGERS.

114
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,708
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO HER?

115
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,791
TO HER FAMILY
OR MAYBE TO A LOVER?

116
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,250
- Marco: HO-HO-HO,
WANNA SEE FOR YOURSELF?

117
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,666
- HUH?

118
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,708
- Both: UGH!

119
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,833
- Marco: HEH HEH HEH,
SURPRISED?

120
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,375
OW!

121
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,000
- STUPID MARCO.

122
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,625
WHO TOLD YOU
TO SHOW THEM THAT?

123
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,750
- MARGERY DAW,
MY LADY OF ANGER.

124
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,791
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH SHOWING THEM?

125
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,958
DON'T YOU SAY
THAT ONLY ALCOHOL

126
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,416
GIVES YOU THE COURAGE
TO TALK ABOUT SOME THINGS?

127
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,833
- MMM.

128
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,791
- ALL THAT BOOZE ON YOUR BREATH
HAS MADE ME EMOTIONAL.

129
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:20,000
BESIDES, IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE
WE'VE HAD SOMEONE TO TALK TO.

130
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,875
- THAT SILVER GUY WE SAW
WAS A CRIMSON DENIZEN?

131
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:27,500
- I GET IT. HE TOOK THE LIFE
OF SOMEONE CLOSE TO HER.

132
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:31,541
- NO, NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

133
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,916
- DID YOU GET REVENGE?
- Marco: NOT YET.

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,166
DENIZENS HAVE THE ABILITY
TO CHANGE THEIR APPEARANCE.

135
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,250
I'M NOT COUNTING ON HIM
STILL LOOKING LIKE THAT.

136
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,500
BESIDES, WHOEVER HEARD OF A
DENIZEN WITH A SILVER FLAME?

137
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,875
- Both: MMM.

138
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,750
- THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE
GONNA GIVE UP.

139
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:51,416
THE TWO OF US ARE GONNA KEEP
SEARCHING UNTIL WE FIND HIM.

140
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,833
- HMM.
STUPID MARCO.

141
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,458
I KNEW YOU WERE NOTHING
BUT A BIG SOFTIE.

142
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,375
- Marco: YOU THINK SO?
MAYBE ALL YOUR BOOZING

143
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,916
HAS MADE ME DRUNK TOO.

144
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,291
- WELL, ALL YOUR TALKING
ABOUT THAT NONSENSE

145
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,375
HAS COMPLETELY SOBERED ME UP.

146
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,500
- ( gasps )

147
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,041
- DO YOU FALL IN LOVE
WITH A GIRL'S WEAK SIDE?

148
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,083
- I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

149
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,333
- ( Marco laughing )

150
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:35,291
THAT'S IT FOR TONIGHT.
LET'S GET SOME SLEEP.

151
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,250
( laughing )

152
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,208
- BIG SISTER, GOOD NIGHT.

153
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,333
- Marco: SLEEP WELL
AND REST EASY, YOU TWO.

154
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,041
- HYAH!
- UH, AH!

155
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,916
OW, MAN!

156
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,291
OW!  EE!  OW!

157
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,458
COME ON, WAIT A MINUTE!

158
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,458
- I TOLD YOU,
DON'T CLOSE YOUR EYES.

159
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,916
- SURE, BUT I DON'T GET IT.

160
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
YOU WANT ME TO KEEP MY EYES OPEN
AND STARE AT A STICK?

161
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,666
DON'T YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF
FIGHTING STYLE OR A TECHNIQUE?

162
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,583
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

163
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,500
- Alastor: IT APPEARS
HE CAN'T FOLLOW DIRECTIONS

164
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,083
UNLESS HE KNOWS THE REASONING
BEHIND THEM FIRST,

165
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,125
ALTHOUGH REAL TRAINING
INVOLVES SHUTTING UP

166
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,333
AND DOING AS YOU'RE TOLD.

167
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,166
- YOU'RE NOT TEACHING A DOG.

168
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,833
I NEED SOME KIND
OF EXPLANATION HERE.

169
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,458
- HMM.

170
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,666
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A FIGHT,

171
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,833
YOUR MOST IMPORTANT SKILL
IS THE ABILITY TO FEEL THE KILL.

172
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,083
IF YOU'RE ABLE TO DO THAT,

173
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,666
YOU CAN AVOID
YOUR OPPONENT'S LETHAL STRIKE

174
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,916
WHILE FINDING A GAP
FOR YOUR OWN BLOW.

175
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,375
SO FOR OUR FIRST LESSON, I WANT
YOU TO STOP THINKING SO MUCH.

176
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,541
SENSE THE KILL
THAT I'M CREATING WITHIN ME.

177
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,750
- THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

178
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,416
HOW DO I SENSE THIS KILL?

179
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,166
IT IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT YOU CAN THINK ABOUT.

180
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,125
YOU HAVE TO WATCH CAREFULLY
UNTIL YOU CAN SENSE IT.

181
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,750
I REALLY MEAN IT WHEN I SAY
DON'T CLOSE YOUR EYES.

182
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,583
- YOU'RE KIDDING.
- OKAY, GET UP.

183
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,750
- UH, JUST A MINUTE.

184
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:14,916
AH!

185
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,708
- Alastor: THIS DOESN'T
LOOK PROMISING.

186
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,791
WE COULD BE WASTING
OUR TIME.

187
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,750
- YOU CAN'T EXPECT PERFECTION
ON THE FIRST DAY.

188
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,250
I'M ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO AGAIN.

189
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,458
- ( chuckles )

190
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,083
- UH, WHAT IS IT?

191
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,458
- IT'S-- IT'S NOTHING.
READY?

192
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,791
- I THINK YOU TWO
HAD BETTER FINISH UP SOON

193
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,375
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LATE
FOR SCHOOL.

194
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,583
SOME TEA, SHANA-CHAN?

195
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,583
- THANK YOU.

196
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,666
- SO THEN,
DOES HE HAVE POTENTIAL?

197
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,625
- NO, HE'S AWFUL.
- HUH?

198
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,958
- OH, I'M SO SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

199
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,208
- THAT'S BRUTAL,

200
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,416
BUT I GUESS I'M LUCKY
TO HAVE A MOTHER

201
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,458
WHO'S SO UNDERSTANDING.

202
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:00,666
- YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE HIM
MARTIAL ARTS LESSONS?

203
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,416
THAT'S WONDERFUL!

204
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,166
MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
GO EASY ON HIM.

205
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,125
- UH...

206
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,708
- I WON'T.
- WHAT?

207
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,291
- ( sighs )

208
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,208
- OH, SHANA-CHAN,
I DREW A BATH FOR YOU.

209
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,083
WHY DON'T YOU GO IN
AND FRESHEN UP?

210
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:16,666
YOU DON'T WANNA GO TO SCHOOL
ALL SWEATY, DO YOU?

211
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,166
- WELL...

212
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,791
- NOW QUICK, HOP RIGHT IN

213
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,458
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LATE
THIS MORNING.

214
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,791
- MMM.

215
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:35,041
- ( Margery moaning )
I'M DYING.

216
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,708
GO AHEAD, FINISH ME OFF.

217
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:41,291
( grunting )
OH, MY HEAD IS SPINNING.

218
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,708
- ( Marco laughing )

219
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,833
OH, ALCOHOL,
A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD!

220
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,500
EITHER WAY, I'M NOT GONNA
USE THE CLEANSING FLAME

221
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,666
ON YOU JUST YET.

222
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,791
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN FOR NOW,
MARGERY DAW,

223
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,041
MY ANGEL OF DRUNKENNESS!

224
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,875
- STUPID MARCO,
YOU'RE DEAD.

225
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,583
- PLEASE, MR. MARCO,
I'M BEGGING YOU.

226
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,375
DO SOMETHING
TO MAKE HER FEEL BETTER.

227
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,416
- Marco: NOT A CHANCE. 
- HMM?

228
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,750
- SPOIL HER NOW AND IT'LL BE
THE SAME THING AGAIN TONIGHT.

229
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,875
( laughing )
- I GUESS WE DON'T WANT THAT.

230
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,708
- I'M FINE WITH HER DRINKING.
- LET'S NOT BE HASTY.

231
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:17,541
- STUPID MARCO, WHAT IF THE
CORPSE COLLECTOR ESCAPES

232
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,291
BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO CRUEL
TO HELP ME?

233
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,166
OW.
- Marco: I'LL CLEANSE YOU

234
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,500
IF HE DECIDES
TO MAKE AN APPEARANCE.

235
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,666
- MMM, LISTEN, YOU TWO.

236
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,333
CHECK THE BUILDING WHERE
THAT FIGHT HAPPENED YESTERDAY.

237
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,583
FOR SOME REASON,

238
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,750
THAT PERVERTED PUPPETEER KNEW
EXACTLY WHERE LAMIES WOULD SHOW.

239
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,833
OH, MY HEAD.
- OOH!

240
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,458
- HE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING
IN THERE.

241
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,166
- DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE ON IT!

242
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,958
- GUESS WE'RE SKIPPIN' SCHOOL
AGAIN.

243
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:45,958
- MMM.
- ( door closes )

244
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:50,083
- ( Marco laughing ) THEY'RE
GOOD KIDS, DON'T YA THINK?

245
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:53,458
( laughing )
- AW, SHUT UP!  AH!

246
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,500
- ( sighs )

247
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:03,416
I'VE NEVER CLEANED MY BODY
THIS WAY BEFORE.

248
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,458
- Alastor: CONSIDERING
SHE'S YOUR MOTHER,

249
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,125
SHE'S QUITE LEVEL-HEADED.

250
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,791
- YEAH, NOTHING BOTHERS HER.
- Alastor: INDEED.

251
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,916
- TELL ME, THAT FLAME HAZE
FROM YESTERDAY

252
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,458
IS STILL IN MISAKI, ISN'T SHE?
- MMM.

253
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,208
- WHICH MEANS THAT LAMIES
IS STILL SAFE AND SOUND.

254
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,541
- Alastor: YES, BUT
THOSE TWO SOCIOPATHS

255
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,916
DON'T KNOW
WHEN TO GIVE UP.

256
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,041
THEY'VE COVERED
THE ENTIRE CITY

257
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,166
WITH A SPECIALIZED
UNRESTRICTED METHOD.

258
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,375
- YOU SEEM TO KNOW LAMIES
PRETTY WELL.

259
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,750
- Alastor: FROM LONG AGO.
- HUH.

260
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:36,750
- BUT MY DESIRE TO PROTECT HIM
IS OF A MORE PRACTICAL NATURE.

261
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,833
IT HAS TO DO WITH THE QUANTITY
OF EXISTENCES

262
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,041
THAT HE HAS COLLECTED.

263
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,791
HE'S BEEN ENGAGED IN THIS
PRACTICE FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS,

264
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:48,750
SO IT'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT.
HE'S CAPPED ALL THIS POWER

265
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:52,583
BY USING AN UNRESTRICTED METHOD
OF HIS OWN CREATION.

266
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,791
- Yuji: I THINK HE TOLD ME
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

267
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,500
- Alastor: SHOULD HE BE
ELIMINATED FOR SOME REASON,

268
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,583
A TREMENDOUS
NUMBER OF EXISTENCES

269
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,583
WOULD SUDDENLY BE FREED.

270
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,750
JUST THINK ABOUT THE EFFECT
THAT WOULD HAVE ON THIS WORLD.

271
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,416
- Yuji: I GUESS IT WOULD BE
LIKE A BOMB GOING OFF.

272
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,916
- Alastor: ANYWAY, WE MUST
EITHER MAKE THE CLAWS

273
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,500
AND FANGS OF VIOLATION

274
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,333
AND THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES
PROMISE TO LEAVE HIM ALONE,

275
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,625
OR WE MUST GIVE THEM
SUCH A THRASHING

276
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,083
THAT THEY ARE INCAPABLE
OF PURSUING HIM.

277
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,666
EITHER WAY, WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO FIGHT THEM AGAIN.

278
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,916
I ASSUME YOU STILL
HAVE THE AZURE

279
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,916
THAT YOU TOOK FROM THE HUNTER.

280
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,625
- HMM.

281
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,000
- HMM.
IT LOOKS LIKE

282
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,875
YOU'RE GOING TO BE HELPING US
IN THE UPCOMING BATTLES.

283
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,291
I'M STILL NOT CONVINCED
IT'S A GOOD IDEA,

284
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,458
BUT SHANA
HAS HER HEART SET ON IT.

285
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,750
WHAT?
- WELL, ALASTOR,

286
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,291
I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
YOU'VE EVER CALLED HER SHANA.

287
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,791
- Alastor:
THE NAME COMES IN HANDY

288
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,666
WHEN I'M TALKING
TO YOU ABOUT HER.

289
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,041
- YOU KNOW MY PLAN
WAS TO FIGHT TOGETHER WITH HER

290
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,333
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING.

291
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,291
ALTHOUGH I WON'T BE
THAT USEFUL AT FIRST.

292
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,000
- Alastor: JUST DON'T
GET IN OUR WAY.

293
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,500
- I WON'T.

294
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,958
IF I TRY HARD ENOUGH,

295
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,000
I'M SURE I CAN HELP YOU
IN A LOT OF WAYS.

296
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,750
- Shana:
HE USED TO IRRITATE ME,

297
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,166
BUT NOW I CAN FEEL
THIS ENERGY INSIDE ME.

298
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,375
HOW STRANGE.

299
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,000
- Tanaka: BIG SISTER! 
- HMM?

300
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,000
- BIG SISTER,
WE FOUND SOMETHING UNUSUAL.

301
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,708
THIS IS MISAKI CITY,
ISN'T IT?

302
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,625
- YEAH, IN GREAT DETAIL TOO.

303
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,333
- Margery: NOW I SEE.

304
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:22,125
HE WAS USING THE CRYSTAL ALTAR.
HOW CLEVER.

305
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,958
WITH THIS, HE WAS ABLE
TO SEE THE TORCHES

306
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,541
THAT LAMIES
WAS CONSUMING.

307
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,375
- Marco: HE WAS WELL KNOWN
FOR COLLECTING TREASURES.

308
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:32,125
- WELL, HE WON'T BE NEEDING IT
ANYMORE.  KEISAKU, EITA,

309
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,083
I'M GONNA USE ANOTHER
UNRESTRICTED METHOD

310
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,375
FOR DETECTION.

311
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,166
EVEN IF HE'S MOVING,
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE HIM

312
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,250
IN THE CRYSTAL ALTAR.

313
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,750
DON'T MISS IT.

314
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,291
- Both: RIGHT.

315
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,625
- YOU KNOW, WE MIGHT EVEN BE
ABLE TO FIND

316
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,291
THAT SILVER GUY
WITH THIS THING.

317
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,041
- YEAH, GOOD IDEA.

318
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,291
- THIS ALTAR
DOESN'T SHOW DENIZENS,

319
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:53,541
JUST HUMANS AND TORCHES.
- DAMN, IS THAT ALL?

320
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,375
- BUT WE MAY BE ABLE
TO LEARN SOMETHING

321
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,541
IF WE KEEP AN EYE
ON THE TORCHES.

322
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,000
- HMM,
A CURIOUS CAT'S A LOST CAT.

323
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,958
- HMM?
- NOW LET'S PUT AN END TO THIS.

324
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:06,750
- Marco: RIGHT ON! MARGERY DAW,
MY SWORD OF VENGEANCE!

325
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,708
- UGH, I HURT ALL OVER.

326
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,916
- YES, YOU NEED TO TOUGHEN UP.

327
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,416
- HEY, I JUST STARTED.
HUH?

328
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,750
- WHAT?

329
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,083
- IT'S YOSHIDA.

330
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,500
I FORGOT.

331
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,750
I GUESS I JUST ABANDONED HER
AND RAN STRAIGHT HOME YESTERDAY.

332
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,041
- MMM.
- I'LL APOLOGIZE.

333
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,791
- HMM?
- LOOK THERE.

334
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,916
- NOW, SHOW YOURSELF,
CORPSE COLLECTOR.

335
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,583
- UGH!

336
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,291
- THAT'S A SPELL OF DETECTION.

337
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,666
- Alastor: WE SHALL
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.

338
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,708
- LAMIES.

339
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,000
GOT HIM.
HE'S SO CLOSE,

340
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,291
IT WOULD BE EASY TO HEAD THERE
AND WAIT FOR THAT CRAZY WOMAN

341
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,666
TO SHOW UP.

342
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,166
- BUT...

343
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,958
- YUJI!  HURRY UP!
- HMM?

344
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,750
WHAT ARE SAKAI AND YUKARI
DOING TOGETHER?

345
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,500
- KEISAKU, EITA,

346
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,041
I SENSE SOMETHING
IN THE WESTSIDE.  DO YOU SEE IT?

347
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,250
- I'M WATCHING.
YEAH, THERE'S SOMETHING THERE.

348
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,916
- WHOA.  IT'S GONE.
- GONE WHERE?

349
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
- CAN'T TELL,
THERE ARE TOO MANY TORCHES.

350
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,375
- UGH!
I'LL DO IT AGAIN.

351
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,666
FIND HIM, AND TRY
NOT TO LOSE HIM THIS TIME.

352
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,958
AAH!

353
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,041
- WHAT'S THAT?

354
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,166
SHE'S USING
THE DETECTION METHOD AGAIN.

355
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:47,541
HEY, LAMIES IS ON THE MOVE.
HE'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE.

356
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,875
- Alastor:
WHAT INCREDIBLE SPEED.

357
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,875
A SPECIAL UNRESTRICTED METHOD?

358
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,708
- BUT I DIDN'T SENSE ANYTHING
OUT OF THE ORDINARY.

359
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,541
HE'S TRICKY.

360
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,208
HE'LL BE AWFULLY HARD
TO CATCH LIKE THIS.

361
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,166
- UH...

362
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,166
- BIG SISTER,
HE JUST DISAPPEARED AGAIN.

363
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,250
- IS HE CHANGING LOCATIONS
INSTANTLY?

364
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,500
BUT THAT'S A VERY POWERFUL
UNRESTRICTED METHOD.

365
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,208
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SENSE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

366
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,000
- HEY, MARGERY,

367
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,958
CAN OTHER CREATURES
BECOME TORCHES AS WELL?

368
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,375
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
ONLY PEOPLE.

369
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,625
THERE SHOULD BE
JUST PEOPLE THERE, RIGHT?

370
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:28,375
- NO, I CAN SEE
BIRDS HERE, TOO.

371
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,958
- WHAT?

372
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:35,000
- YOU'RE RIGHT.  HOW COME?
- SEVERAL BIRD TORCHES.

373
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,875
- Marco: YOU KNOW, MAYBE
THE ALTAR IS MALFUNCTIONING.

374
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:41,875
- HMM.  RIGHT.
I BET THAT'S IT.

375
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,500
KEISAKU, EITA,
WATCH THOSE BIRDS CLOSELY

376
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,125
AND TELL ME WHERE THEY GO.

377
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,375
- Tanaka: GOTCHA! 
- HMM.

378
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:52,041
- Yuji: SHANA,
HAS THAT FLAME HAZE MOVED YET?

379
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,791
- NO, SHE'S USED
HER DETECTION METHOD TWICE,

380
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,458
BUT SHE'S STILL
IN THE SAME PLACE.

381
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:57,541
- STOP FOR A SECOND.

382
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,958
THINK ABOUT IT, SHANA.

383
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,708
WE'RE BEING FORCED
TO RUN ALL OVER THE CITY HERE.

384
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,958
I BET THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT LAMIES
WANTS THOSE GUYS TO DO.

385
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,291
- HUH?
- IT'S A COMMON STRATEGY

386
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,541
TO USE A FAKE OR A COPY
TO TRICK PEOPLE.

387
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:14,250
- Alastor: A DECOY MANEUVER. 
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

388
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,541
IF LAMIES COULD REALLY
MOVE AROUND THE CITY

389
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:17,708
AS QUICKLY AS THAT,

390
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,750
THEN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
LONG GONE BY NOW.

391
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:20,791
- MMM.

392
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,625
- I THINK WHAT'S
REALLY HAPPENING...

393
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,541
- Alastor: GO ON.

394
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,250
...IS THAT HE ISN'T
ACTUALLY MOVING AT ALL.

395
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,458
- ( gasps )

396
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,458
- Alastor: A SKILLED
UNRESTRICTED-METHOD USER

397
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,375
LIKE LAMIES COULD DO THAT.

398
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,375
- AND IT'S PRETTY STRANGE
THAT EVEN THOUGH

399
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,375
THE OTHER FLAME HAZE
MUST HAVE SPOTTED HIM,

400
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,291
SHE HASN'T BUDGED AN INCH.

401
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,375
MAYBE SHE KNOWS
IT'S SOME KIND OF TRICK.

402
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,125
- DO YOU THINK SHE KNOWS
WHERE HIS REAL LOCATION IS?

403
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,125
- MAYBE.  I BET THEY'LL BE
ON THE MOVE SOON.

404
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,916
THEY'RE JUST WAITING.

405
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,500
- WE'LL ARRIVE TOO LATE
IF WE TRY AND FOLLOW HER.

406
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,416
LAMIES DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO FIGHT,

407
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,375
SO I'M PRETTY SURE
HE'LL GO DOWN QUICKLY.

408
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,166
WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHERE HE IS
AND THEN GET THERE FIRST.

409
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,958
- I THINK I KNOW.

410
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,791
THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM
WAS AT THE MUSEUM.

411
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,500
I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT WAS THE REAL LAMIES TOO.

412
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:09,208
IT'S JUST A FEELING,
BUT I THINK HE'S THERE.

413
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,583
- GRAB ON.
WE'LL HAVE TO FLY.

414
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,458
- HUH?
- COME ON!  THERE'S NO TIME.

415
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,125
- OKAY.  ALL RIGHT.

416
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,833
- YOU HAVE TO HOLD ON
TIGHTER THAN THAT.

417
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:24,125
- TIGHTER, RIGHT.
- A LOT TIGHTER.

418
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,208
- HOW TIGHT?
- TIGHTER!

419
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,500
- ( grunting )

420
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:33,833
- WHY IS IT I FEEL STRONGER?

421
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:39,000
- AH, LAMIES.
HE'S A CLEVER ONE, ALL RIGHT.

422
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:42,458
HE HAS HIS DUMMY CONSUME A
TORCH, AND WHEN IT'S DETECTED,

423
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,500
HE CHANGES INTO BIRDS
AND COLLECTS THEM

424
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,708
WHILE ACTIVATING ANOTHER DECOY.

425
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,250
THEN HE ABSORBS THE BIRDS
THAT FLY BACK TO HIM,

426
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,500
BECAUSE WE'RE FOLLOWING
THE DUMMIES,

427
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:52,791
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S
CHANGING LOCATIONS

428
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,333
ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY.

429
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,208
THANK GOODNESS FOR THE ALTAR.

430
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,375
- Marco: GATHERING HIS STRENGTH
A LITTLE BIT HERE,

431
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,208
A LITTLE BIT THERE. HUH, WHAT A
BORING WAY TO DO THINGS.

432
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:05,208
- KEISAKU, EITA, HAVE ALL THE
BIRDS GATHERED TOGETHER?

433
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,833
- Tanaka: JUST ABOUT.
- I SEE.

434
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,041
THEN I'LL SAY IT NOW
WHILE I HAVE THE CHANCE.

435
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,833
THANK YOU.

436
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,625
- HUH?  WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHILE YOU HAVE THE CHANCE?

437
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,583
- JUST LIKE I SAID.

438
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,708
WHEN I FINISH THAT GUY OFF,
I'M OUTTA HERE.

439
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,666
- NO WAY, BIG SIS,
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

440
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,250
- BE QUIET.

441
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,333
DENIZENS DON'T APPEAR
THAT OFTEN.

442
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:28,041
PEOPLE GO THEIR WHOLE LIVES
WITHOUT SEEING ONE.

443
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:31,375
YOU'VE MET ONE AND SURVIVED,
SO YOU SHOULD BE FINE NOW.

444
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:35,041
WELL, GOOD-BYE.  I ACTUALLY
ENJOYED MYSELF FOR A CHANGE.

445
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:38,875
- Marco: HEADS UP
AND STAY SAFE, YOU TWO!

446
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,583
( dying down )

447
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:43,166
- WHY?
I WANTED TO HELP HER

448
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,500
UNTIL SHE GOT HER REVENGE
ON THOSE WHO'VE WRONGED HER.

449
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,250
- SHE USED US.

450
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,250
AND WHEN SHE WAS FINISHED,
SHE JUST DISAPPEARED.

451
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:54,000
THANKS A LOT, MARGERY.

452
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:56,333
- KILL 'EM, KILL 'EM,
KILL 'EM,

453
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,791
KILL 'EM!
KILL THE DENIZENS!

454
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:03,000
- Alastor: YOU'LL BE FACING
THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES AGAIN.

455
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,958
- I WON'T LOSE THIS TIME.

456
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:07,333
- DO YOU THINK WE'LL MAKE IT
IN TIME?

457
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:09,041
IF LAMIES DIES,
THIS CITY IS GOING TO--

458
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,666
- DON'T WORRY.
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

459
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,833
THE DUTY OF A FLAME HAZE
IS TO MAINTAIN THE BALANCE

460
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,958
OF THE WORLD,
NO MATTER WHAT.

461
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:17,125
- OKAY.

462
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:22,000
- I FEEL SO POWERFUL!
I CAN DO ANYTHING!

463
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,041
- ( choir chanting )

464
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:28,416
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

465
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:58,750
- Yuji: THE FLAME-HAIRED
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER

466
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:00,916
AND THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

467
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,541
TWO BRIGHT FLAMES.

468
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:05,083
A CLASH BETWEEN DUTY
AND HATRED.

469
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:07,875
WHICH WILL SURVIVE?
