1
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,833
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:38,291
LIVES CONSUMED
IN SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.

3
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:41,291
NO ONE CAN TELL
WHEN THE WORLD IS DISPLACED,

4
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:45,916
AND THE FLAMES OF THE
CRIMSON WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,708
- ( theme song playing )

6
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,458
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

7
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:19,791
- YES, BUT IT'S STILL BETTER
THAN WAITING FOR THE END TO COME

8
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,625
AND THEN BEING FORGOTTEN.

9
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,958
I THINK MY EXISTENCE,
MY MEMORY,

10
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,458
IS A PART OF IKE
AND THE OTHERS NOW.

11
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:29,083
AND THEN THERE'S YOU.

12
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,333
YOU WON'T FORGET ME.

13
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,083
- Shana: YOU'RE RIGHT.

14
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,375
BUT IT WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE
IN THE END.

15
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,750
- Yuji: SHE WAS GOING
TO REMEMBER ME,

16
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,958
AND AT THE TIME I THOUGHT
THAT WAS ENOUGH.

17
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,250
BUT THERE WAS SO MUCH
I DIDN'T KNOW.

18
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,958
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

19
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,833
- ( bird squawking )

20
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:02,041
- I WONDER WHERE SHE WENT.

21
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,041
MMM.

22
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:10,791
- ( leaves rustling )

23
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:11,750
- HUH?

24
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,125
OH NO, SHANA!

25
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,500
- STAY BACK!

26
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,291
- WHAT-- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

27
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,208
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

28
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,416
- LEAVE ME ALONE.

29
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,625
- YOU'RE HURT.

30
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,041
- IT'S YOUR FAULT.

31
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,291
- ( gasps )

32
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,666
I'LL GET SOMETHING
FOR YOU TO CHANGE INTO.

33
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,166
COME INTO THE HOUSE.

34
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,458
SHANA.

35
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,416
- YOU'RE NOTHING TO ME.

36
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,041
JUST A TORCH.

37
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:48,250
- Friagne:
SO I WASN'T IMAGINING THINGS.

38
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:55,916
- ( flames whooshing out )

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,250
- SOMEONE OUT THERE
IS REMOVING ALL OF THE TORCHES

40
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,166
I SO CAREFULLY PLACED.

41
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,291
- IS IT HER?

42
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:06,583
- NO.  THIS ISN'T THE WORK
OF A FLAME HAZE.

43
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,583
IF THEY WANTED TO LURE ME
INTO THE OPEN,

44
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,458
THEY WOULD ERASE MORE
THAN A SINGLE TORCH AT A TIME.

45
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:13,958
- MMM.

46
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,583
- BESIDES, I DON'T THINK
THEY EVEN KNOW

47
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,375
THAT I NEED THE TORCHES.

48
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,166
THEY DON'T KNOW
THAT I PLAN ON USING THEM.

49
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,708
- OH, MASTER.
( crying )

50
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,833
- THERE, THERE, MARIANNE.

51
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,375
NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE,

52
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:33,208
I WON'T LET THEM GET AWAY
WITH THEIR TAMPERING.

53
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,500
THAT I PROMISE.

54
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,041
- Yuji: BYE, MOM!

55
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,500
HMM.

56
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,125
- I CAN DO IT.

57
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,000
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I CAN SAY IT.

58
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:31,000
I CAN DO IT.  IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I CAN SAY IT.

59
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,000
- HEY, YOSHIDA,
GOOD MORNING.

60
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:38,000
- HUH?
HI, GOOD MORNING, IKE.

61
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,625
- SO, WHAT'S UP?

62
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,500
- OH, NOTHING.
WHERE'S SAKAI?

63
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:46,166
- UM, I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM YET.
- OH.

64
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,458
- WHY?  DO YOU WANT
TO SPEAK TO HIM?

65
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,291
- NO!
I MEAN, YES, BUT...

66
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,625
MY DAD GAVE ME
THESE TWO FREE TICKETS.

67
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:59,458
OR MAYBE EVEN A MOVIE,
THAT WOULD BE OKAY.

68
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,958
BUT I THOUGHT
THIS WOULD BE NICE TOO.

69
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,750
AND SO I THOUGHT I'D JUST--
- GOOD MORNING!

70
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,791
- GOOD MORNING TO YOU TOO.

71
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:10,291
- AH, SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.
- PARDON ME?

72
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,416
- SO GOT ANYTHING LINED UP
AFTER SCHOOL?

73
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,583
- AFTER SCHOOL?
NOTHING IN PARTICULAR.

74
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:17,666
- AH, EXCELLENT.

75
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,708
HEY, YOSHIDA,
WHAT ABOUT SAKAI HERE?

76
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,083
- WHAT?

77
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,500
- YOU WERE TELLING ME ABOUT
THAT PERSON WHO CANCELED

78
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,208
AND HOW YOU NEED SOMEONE
TO GO WITH.

79
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,708
- ME?

80
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:31,000
UM, WELL, I HAVE TWO TICKETS
TO THE ART EXHIBITION TODAY.

81
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:35,041
AND I THOUGHT IF YOU WEREN'T
DOING ANYTHING AFTER SCHOOL...

82
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,083
- TWO TICKETS?
- ( chuckles )

83
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,625
- WITH ME?

84
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,250
- MMM.

85
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,500
- ( horns honking )

86
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,625
- HMM.
CLASS HAS ALREADY STARTED.

87
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,666
WHAT A DRAG.

88
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,333
- SO YOU WANNA SKIP OUT?
- FOR SURE.

89
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,500
UH, WHAT'S WRONG?

90
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,166
- JUST OUR LUCK,
WE HAD TO RUN INTO THEM.

91
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,125
OH!

92
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:10,541
- THAT WAS QUITE A BEATING
SHE TOOK.

93
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,833
I DON'T THINK WE'LL SEE
THE BLAZING-EYED LITTLE BRAT

94
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,625
FOR QUITE A WHILE.

95
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:18,000
- Marco: YEAH, NOW IF WE
CAN JUST FIND OUR MAIN DISH,

96
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,125
THE CORPSE COLLECTOR,
WE'LL CHEW HIM UP

97
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:23,000
AND SPIT HIM OUT!
( laughs )

98
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,958
- SAME PLAN AS ALWAYS.
WE NEED TO FIND SOMEONE

99
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,458
WHO KNOWS THE CITY
AND CAN SHOW US AROUND.

100
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,541
- Marco: AND IT WOULDN'T HURT
IF THEY WERE YOUNG

101
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,458
AND GOOD LOOKING, EH? 
- THAT'S ENOUGH, STUPID MARCO.

102
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,916
- ( grunting )

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,333
( both grunt )

104
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,750
- THESE TWO WILL DO JUST FINE.

105
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,875
- Marco: OKAY OKAY!

106
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:45,708
AREN'T THEY A BIT TOO YOUNG
FOR YOUR LIKING, THOUGH?

107
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,250
- GET BACK HERE!

108
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,666
- WE GOT HIM NOW.
- LOOK AT THIS.

109
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,500
- HA!

110
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,375
- ( boys grunting,
protesting )

111
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,958
- HMM.

112
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,333
- I-- I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE, LADY,

113
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,083
BUT WE'LL HURT YOU
IF WE HAVE TO.

114
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,625
SO YOU BETTER
NOT GET IN OUR WAY.

115
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,250
- DON'T MAKE ME HURT YOU BOYS
AS WELL.

116
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,625
- YOU JUST SHUT UP.
LET'S GO, TANAKA.

117
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,750
YOU DEAF?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

118
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,916
- MAY I CALL YOU "BIG SISTER"?
CAN I?

119
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,916
- Ike: SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- HUH?

120
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,583
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "HUH"?
AFTER CLASSES, AFTER SCHOOL?

121
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:44,000
- OH, UH...

122
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,666
- AFTER ALL, YOU SAID
YOU WERE FREE,

123
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,291
AND IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO LET
THOSE TICKETS GO TO WASTE.

124
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,791
YOU SHOULD GO WITH HER.

125
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:54,416
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

126
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,208
I'D BE GLAD TO GO WITH YOU.

127
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,541
- Alastor: SHOULDN'T YOU BE
A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE MYSTES?

128
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,125
- ( humming )

129
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,833
- Marco:
AND THAT'S WHY THE TWO OF YOU

130
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:17,125
ARE GONNA HELP US LOOK
FOR THE DENIZEN IN THIS CITY.

131
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,958
( laughing ) 
- UNDERSTAND?

132
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,625
- Both: MM-HMM.
- THAT'S GOOD.

133
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,625
- SO, UM, BIG SISTER?

134
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,458
WHAT EXACTLY
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

135
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:32,666
- LET'S SEE, FOR NOW,
JUST ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I ASK.

136
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,458
YOU BOYS ARE
FROM AROUND HERE, RIGHT?

137
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,625
- YEAH.

138
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,125
- WATCH IT, KID.
- YES, MA'AM.

139
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,958
- HAVE THERE BEEN ANY MAJOR
DISTURBANCES OR ACCIDENTS?

140
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:45,083
ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY?

141
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,666
- HMM, YOU KNOW,

142
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,000
MAYBE YOU SHOULD BUY
A NEWSPAPER?

143
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,250
 I DON'T READ THE PAPER.

144
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,708
BUT I HEARD ABOUT SOME TRAFFIC
ACCIDENTS, BUT NOTHING ELSE.

145
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,041
- Both: HMM.

146
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,708
- WELL.

147
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:06,416
THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE
ABOUT THIS CITY.

148
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,041
- ( flames whooshing out )

149
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,541
- PLEASE STAY HERE, MARIANNE.

150
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,541
- MASTER?

151
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,291
- HMM, I FOUND YOU.

152
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,875
- Alastor:
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

153
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,583
- WHY WHAT?

154
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,708
- Alastor: WHY YOU LOST
TO THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

155
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,041
- ( inaudible )

156
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:11,125
- THAT'S IT?
JUST ONE LITTLE ROBBERY?

157
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,166
THERE HASN'T BEEN ANYTHING
ELSE UNUSUAL?

158
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,000
- NO, NOTHING.

159
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,125
- THEN LET'S FOCUS
ON THOSE TORCHES

160
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,166
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

161
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,625
WHERE WOULD WE FIND A LARGE
GROUP OF THEM CONGREGATING?

162
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,083
- Both: UH...
- THEN WHAT ABOUT A SPOT

163
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,875
WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE
TEND TO GATHER?

164
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,458
- LET'S SEE...

165
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,791
THERE'S ALWAYS A BIG CROWD
AT THE STATION.

166
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,083
- OKAY, WE'LL START
WITH THE BUILDING

167
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,833
AND THEN DO A THOROUGH SEARCH
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

168
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,291
- WHAT'S UP?
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

169
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,458
- A PALE WHITE FLAME.

170
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,625
- Marco:
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

171
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,458
- THE HUNTER, FRIAGNE.

172
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,958
- UH...

173
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,208
- YOU BOYS CHILL.

174
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,708
JUST WAIT HERE FOR A BIT.

175
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,500
- THAT'S STRANGE.

176
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,208
THE CULPRIT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE.

177
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,125
- I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO RUN INTO HIM.

178
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,208
QUITE A BIG CATCH,
DON'T YOU THINK?

179
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:13,166
- Marco: YEAH, IT'S LIKE CHASING
A MINNOW AND FINDING A WHALE.

180
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,666
( laughing )

181
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,916
- A PERFECT CHANCE
TO KILL HIM.  AGREED?

182
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,916
- Marco: AGREED.  I THINK
THAT'S A FANTASTIC IDEA.

183
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,125
MARGERY DAW,
MY FANGS OF DESTRUCTION!

184
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,041
- I CAN SENSE IT.
THERE'S A FLAME HAZE NEAR.

185
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,000
- THE HUNTER
IS ON THE MOVE AGAIN.

186
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,791
- Alastor: LEAVE HIM BE.

187
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,875
THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES
IS HEADING THAT WAY NOW.

188
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,208
- BUT--

189
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,875
- Alastor: IT'S DANGEROUS.
YOU'RE TOO DISTRACTED.

190
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:50,458
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS
WE MUST DO IN THE MEANTIME.

191
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,500
- WOW, THIS ONE'S BEAUTIFUL.

192
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:15,625
- YEAH, IT SURE IS.
THERE'S A LOT MORE.

193
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,583
I HEAR THERE'S A STAINED-GLASS
DISPLAY IN THE BACK.

194
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,208
- REALLY?
LET'S GO SEE IT.

195
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,625
- OKAY, SOUNDS GOOD.

196
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,541
- HUH?

197
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,833
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

198
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,458
- A CRIMSON DENIZEN.

199
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,416
- IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

200
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,250
- AH, SO YOU CAN TELL.

201
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,041
NOW I SEE.
YOU'RE A MYSTES.

202
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,708
HAVE NO FEAR.

203
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,291
I'M NOT GOING
TO DO ANYTHING WITH YOU.

204
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,583
- ( gasping )
- I DISLIKE DOING ANYTHING RASH,

205
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,458
ANYTHING THAT WOULD UPSET
THE BALANCE OF THE WORLD.

206
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,416
- AH.

207
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,625
- I THINK YOU AND I
SHOULD HAVE A TALK.

208
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,791
- DO YOU KNOW THIS PERSON?

209
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,625
- UH, I-- WELL, YEAH, SORT OF.

210
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:41,333
- Friagne: MARGERY DAW,
THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES

211
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:44,875
AND MARCOSIAS, THE CLAWS
AND FANGS OF VIOLATION.

212
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,250
- HUNTER FRIAGNE.

213
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,458
- SO YOU'RE THE NEW FLAME HAZE
IN TOWN.

214
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,500
SOMEHOW I DOUBT IT,
BUT ARE YOU THE ONES

215
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,291
WHO HAVE BEEN MEDDLING
IN MY AFFAIRS?

216
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,416
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT.

217
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,375
I ONLY DECIDED TO KILL YOU
JUST NOW.

218
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,708
- I SEE THEN.
IT SEEMS THE ONE

219
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,541
WHO'S BEEN SO RUDELY
TAMPERING WITH

220
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,166
MY TORCHES HAS ALREADY LEFT.

221
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,291
- HMM?  HE WAS HERE?

222
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:18,125
- Marco: HOO-HOO!  SOUNDS LIKE
THE HUNTER'S AFTER HIM TOO.

223
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,833
- NEVER MIND. I REALLY DON'T
HAVE TIME TO PLAY AROUND

224
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,458
WITH A SIMPLE TOOL
FOR DESTRUCTION LIKE YOU.

225
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,791
BUT I GUESS THE SMART THING

226
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,875
WOULD BE TO KICK A STONE
OUT OF THE WAY

227
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,166
BEFORE I END UP
TRIPPING ON IT.

228
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,583
- I'LL TEACH YOU TO INTERFERE
WITH MY PREY!

229
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,125
- YOUR PREY?

230
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,708
- Marco:
EVEN IF YOU AREN'T READY,

231
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,083
WE'LL STILL RIP YOU APART!

232
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,291
( laughing )

233
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:53,416
- ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL, SAKAI?

234
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,833
HMM.

235
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:01,500
- LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF.
I AM LAMIES,

236
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,500
THE CORPSE COLLECTOR.

237
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,125
AND, AS YOU'VE SURMISED,
I AM A CRIMSON DENIZEN.

238
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,250
- SO YOU'RE ONE OF THEM.
HUH?

239
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,958
ARE YOU THE ONE
WHO HURT SHANA?

240
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,333
- SHANA?

241
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,583
- SHE'S A FLAME HAZE,
OF COURSE.

242
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,333
- RELAX, I DID NO SUCH THING.

243
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,750
BUT FIRST OFF,
I INTRODUCED MYSELF.

244
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,875
PERHAPS YOU WOULD
RETURN THE FAVOR

245
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,291
AND TELL ME WHO YOU ARE,
MY YOUNG MYSTES FRIEND.

246
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,916
- MY NAME IS YUJI SAKAI.

247
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,125
- YOU SOUND QUITE CERTAIN.
YOU'VE RETAINED YOUR SANITY,

248
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,208
DESPITE LEARNING THE TRUE NATURE
OF THE SITUATION YOU'RE IN.

249
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,875
THAT'S QUITE IMPRESSIVE.

250
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:41,708
OR PERHAPS YOU'VE
SIMPLY GIVEN UP ON EVERYTHING.

251
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,166
- HUH?

252
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,541
- YOU MENTIONED SHANA
A MOMENT AGO.

253
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,791
IS THAT FLAME HAZE
OFTEN BY YOUR SIDE?

254
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,958
- I GAVE HER THE NAME SHANA.

255
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,916
SHE'S THE FLAME-HAIRED
BLAZING-EYED ONE.

256
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,625
- SHE'S WHAT?
THEN I IMAGINE ALASTOR,

257
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,375
THE FLAME OF THE HEAVENS,
IS NEARBY.

258
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,958
- YOU MEAN YOU TWO KNOW
EACH OTHER?

259
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,000
- HMM, YES,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

260
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:07,291
I SEE, THE FLAME-HAIRED
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER.

261
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,875
THEN I SHOULD BE ABLE TO AVOID
A MEANINGLESS FIGHT.

262
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,333
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN AVOID IT?
YOU'RE A CRIMSON DENIZEN.

263
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,500
- I DO NOT VICTIMIZE HUMANS.

264
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,416
I AM CALLED
THE CORPSE COLLECTOR

265
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,541
BECAUSE I PREY
SOLELY ON TORCHES THAT ARE WEAK,

266
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,583
LIKE THE ONE
YOU JUST SAW THERE,

267
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,791
ON THE VERGE
OF VANISHING ANYWAY.

268
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,750
IN FACT, THIS BODY
WAS BORROWED FROM A TORCH,

269
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:32,750
SO AS TO CONSERVE THE POWER
OF EXISTENCE.

270
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:36,500
- WHY WOULD YOU
WANT TO DO THAT?

271
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,041
- I HAVE MY REASONS.
- WHAT REASONS?

272
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,666
- I HAVE DEVELOPED
AN UNRESTRICTED

273
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,250
METHOD OF RESTORATION.

274
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,125
I'M IN THE PROCESS OF GATHERING
ENOUGH POWER OF EXISTENCE

275
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,000
TO PUT IT INTO EFFECT.

276
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,500
THAT IS MY PURPOSE IN LIFE.

277
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,500
I WANT TO SEE
THE INFINITE FUTURE

278
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,000
THAT LIES BEFORE US
WITH MY OWN EYES.

279
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:04,500
I WANT TO TOUCH IT
AND MAKE IT A CERTAINTY.

280
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,500
- THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE TARGETING TORCHES?

281
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,833
- ALTHOUGH I ONLY GATHER
THE WEAK ONES, YOU'RE A TORCH,

282
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:13,333
AND I UNDERSTAND HOW THIS
KNOWLEDGE MUST BOTHER YOU.

283
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,875
REST ASSURED,
MY STAY HERE WILL BE BRIEF.

284
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,375
I KEEP MOVING TO STAY AHEAD
OF THE HOUNDS,

285
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:22,041
AND THERE ARE OTHERS OUT THERE
WHO ARE NOT VERY PLEASED

286
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,541
WITH MY ACTIONS IN GENERAL.
- HUH?

287
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:29,708
- ( thunder rumbling )

288
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,833
- TIME TO GET
THIS PARTY STARTED!

289
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:35,375
STRIKE WITHOUT MERCY,
MARCOSIAS!

290
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,291
- Marco: WE'LL KILL HIM!
DESTROY HIM!

291
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,833
WE'LL TEAR HIM TO PIECES!

292
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,083
- I GET THE IMPRESSION
YOU KNOW

293
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:51,291
WHO'S BEEN DEVOURING
ALL OF MY TORCHES HERE.

294
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,125
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU,
WE'RE THE ONES HUNTING LAMIES.

295
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,333
THAT BASTARD IS OUR CATCH!

296
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,583
LET'S SEE YOU
GET AWAY FROM THOSE.

297
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,625
- LAMIES?
LAMIES THE CORPSE COLLECTOR?

298
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,916
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT HIM

299
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,666
BECAUSE YOUR TIME IS UP!

300
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,375
- FLAME-REPELLING RING,
AZURE.

301
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:22,541
- WHAT?
- Marco: THAT'S NOT FAIR!

302
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,333
- COME BACK HERE!
- I'D LOVE TO PLAY SOME MORE,

303
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,041
BUT I JUST
DON'T HAVE THE TIME.

304
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,125
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET AWAY
THAT EASILY!  AAH!

305
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,208
( gasps )
HE'S GONE.

306
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,416
DAMN THAT ASSHOLE!

307
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,500
DAMN ALL OF THEM.

308
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,666
- ARE YOU OKAY, BIG SISTER?

309
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,583
- I NEED A DRINK!

310
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,041
SHOW ME A QUIET PLACE
WITH A LOT OF ALCOHOL

311
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,916
WHERE I CAN DRINK MY FACE OFF
AND THEN PASS OUT!

312
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,750
- BUT WHERE ARE WE GONNA FIND--
OH.

313
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,250
( laughs )

314
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,375
- ( sighs )

315
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,333
HMM.

316
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,875
- Lamies: YOU'VE TOLD ME
WHAT I WANTED TO KNOW.

317
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,625
IT'S TIME I GOT GOING.
- UM...

318
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,208
- ASK YOUR QUESTION.
IT'S ONLY FAIR

319
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,375
I RETURN THE FAVOR
AND PROVIDE YOU

320
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,583
WITH WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW.
- IT'S NOT REALLY A QUESTION.

321
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,041
IT'S JUST, YOU SEEM
TO BE LIVING YOUR LIFE

322
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,208
FOR ONE SINGLE OBJECTIVE.

323
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:35,041
I WAS JUST WONDERING
WHAT THAT MUST FEEL LIKE.

324
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,416
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THAT.

325
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,083
I'M GONNA GO NOW.

326
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,375
- ARE YOU BOTHERED BY THE FACT

327
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,250
THAT YOUR EXISTENCE
WILL SOON DISAPPEAR?

328
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,958
- AH.

329
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:58,916
EVERYONE I EVER KNEW
IS GOING TO FORGET I WAS HERE,

330
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,500
BUT SHANA'S THE ONE PERSON
WHO WILL REMEMBER

331
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,416
THAT I ACTUALLY LIVED.
AND THAT'S--

332
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,791
- YOUNG MAN, CAN YOU SAY
WITH COMPLETE CONFIDENCE

333
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,875
THAT YOU ARE
THE REAL YUJI SAKAI?

334
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:10,875
- HUH?

335
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:18,125
- YOU APPEAR TO BE NOTHING MORE
THAN A TORCH TO ME.

336
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,791
- YOU'RE NOTHING TO ME.
JUST A TORCH.

337
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,791
- LET ME REPHRASE THAT.

338
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:32,083
YOU SAID SHE WILL ALWAYS
REMEMBER THAT YOU LIVED.

339
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,125
BUT ARE YOU FINE WITH THAT?

340
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,458
IS THE PERSON
SHE'S GOING TO REMEMBER

341
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,500
THE PERSON YOU ARE NOW?

342
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:42,750
THERE'S A REASON
I DIDN'T PREY ON YOU.

343
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,875
IT'S BECAUSE THE FLAME
OF YOUR TORCH

344
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,041
STILL BURNS BRIGHTLY
WITHIN YOUR BODY.

345
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,666
LET ME GIVE YOU
SOME INFORMATION.

346
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:02,458
THIS CITY IS IN GRAVE DANGER
AND NO ONE EVEN KNOWS IT YET.

347
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,125
THE PERSON YOU ARE RIGHT NOW

348
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:07,416
WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO
WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE.

349
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,375
FRIAGNE HAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE
IN MIND FOR THIS PLACE.

350
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,416
HE'S GOING TO WIPE IT OUT.

351
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,916
HE PLANS TO CONSUME
THE ENTIRE CITY.

352
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,791
- HMM?
WIPE OUT THE CITY?

353
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,541
- NOTHING WILL BE LEFT
WHEN HE IS DONE.

354
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,708
YOU AND EVERYTHING
YOU'VE EVER COME INTO

355
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,583
CONTACT WITH WILL BE GONE.

356
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:29,416
EVERYTHING WILL DISAPPEAR.
- ( gasps )

357
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,416
- Alastor: WHY ARE YOU
DISTANCING YOURSELF FROM HIM?

358
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,416
- I DON'T KNOW.

359
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:47,208
- TWO FLAME HAZES
TO DEAL WITH,

360
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:49,916
AS WELL AS LAMIES
THE CORPSE COLLECTOR.

361
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,333
WE HAVE TO MOVE QUICKLY.

362
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,500
A LITTLE EARLIER
THAN I'D LIKE, MARIANNE,

363
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:57,291
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD
PUT THE PLAN IN MOTION.

364
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,833
- MASTER.

365
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:01,416
- HMM.

366
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:07,708
- I DON'T GET IT.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT HIM?!

367
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:09,500
- Alastor: VERY WELL THEN.

368
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:13,333
- HE'S JUST A TORCH
THAT'S GONNA DISAPPEAR SOON.

369
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:14,833
- <i>( choir singing )</i>

370
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:17,500
- Alastor: IT'S THAT MYSTES.

371
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:20,458
WE HAVE TO DESTROY
YUJI SAKAI.

372
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:21,958
- HUH?

373
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,500
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

374
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,083
Yuji: THE PLAN
TO CONSUME MISAKI COMMENCES.

375
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,791
BOTH THE CITY AND I
ARE IN GRAVE DANGER.

376
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,708
AND SHANA STRUGGLES
WITH HER INNER THOUGHTS

377
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:06,125
AS SHE CONFRONTS
THE DENIZEN, FRIAGNE.

378
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:07,791
NEXT EPISODE...
