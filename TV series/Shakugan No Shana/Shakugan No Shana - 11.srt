1
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,625
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,875
LIVES CONSUMED
IN SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.

3
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:41,208
NO ONE CAN TELL
WHEN THE WORLD IS DISPLACED,

4
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:45,875
AND THE FLAMES OF THE CRIMSON
WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

5
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:49,166
- ( theme music playing )


6
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:53,333
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

7
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:21,625
- Shana: YUJI, SEND ME YOUR
STRENGTH, LITTLE BY LITTLE.

8
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,875
- OKAY.
- HERE I GO.

9
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:47,166
- Alastor: HMM, IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S GETTING EASIER FOR YOU

10
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,166
TO FIND YOUR WINGS.
- SEEMS THAT WAY.

11
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,750
HA!

12
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:04,125
- ( beeping )

13
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,500
- SHANA, IT'S ALMOST TIME.
- IS IT?

14
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,041
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S
ENOUGH FOR TODAY.

15
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:26,125
- 12:00.
MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

16
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:30,083
I'M GLAD ALL MY ENERGY COMES
BACK, BUT IT SURE FEELS STRANGE.

17
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,541
- BETTER GET USED TO IT.
- YEAH, I GUESS.

18
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:37,375
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK I'M A LITTLE HUNGRY.

19
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:41,083
- HUH?
- WANNA COME INSIDE FOR A SNACK?

20
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,208
- WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?

21
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,041
- I THINK IT'S A RERUN
OF A DRAMA.

22
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,583
- DRAMA?
YOU MEAN IT'S NOT EVEN REAL?

23
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,791
- YEAH.  SHOULD I TURN IT OFF?
SAY THE WORD.

24
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,458
- IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
TO ME.

25
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,125
- RIE!

26
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:18,791
- OW!

27
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,875
- THAT MUST'VE HURT.

28
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,541
- SO WHY DID SHE HIT HIM ANYWAY?

29
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,458
- WELL, I GUESS HIS KISS
TOOK HER BY SURPRISE.

30
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,916
PRETTY NATURAL REACTION.
- JUST BECAUSE OF THAT.

31
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,916
- JUST BECAUSE--
- YOU DON'T FIND IT STRANGE?

32
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,875
- TIRIEL, EVERYONE'S
LOOKING AT US.

33
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,291
THEY'RE STARTING TO SCARE ME.

34
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,208
- CALM YOURSELF.
THERE'S NOTHING TO FEAR.

35
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,666
- Man: THAT'S DISGUSTING.

36
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,875
- IT'S YOUR BEHAVIOR
AS WELL AS YOUR OUTFITS

37
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,708
THAT ARE ATTRACTING
ALL THE ATTENTION. 

38
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,750
- WHY?  THERE'S NOTHING
SHAMEFUL ABOUT A PAIR

39
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:18,666
OF MAGNIFICENT FLOWERS IN BLOOM.
- ( clears throat )

40
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,625
- DON'T FORGET IT'S MY CRADLE
GARDEN THAT IS PROTECTING YOU.

41
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,500
I DON'T APPRECIATE
YOUR FLIPPANT COMMENT.

42
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
- OH, TIRIEL,
CAN I EAT THEM UP?

43
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,708
- YES, OF COURSE YOU CAN,
DEAR BROTHER,

44
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,041
BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL AFTER I'M FINISHED.

45
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,791
- SO WHAT METHOD IS THAT?

46
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,333
- WE'RE GETTING CLOSE TO WHAT
MY BROTHER IS LOOKING FOR.

47
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,416
I'M GETTING SOMETHING READY.

48
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,458
IT WOULD BE A SHAME
IF WE FOUND IT,

49
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,416
ONLY TO HAVE SOMEONE ELSE WALK
AWAY WITH IT, DON'T YOU THINK?

50
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,208
- YOU'RE GONNA TRAP IT SO NO ONE
WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE IT AWAY.

51
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,333
INSIDE OUR CRADLE!

52
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,000
- THERE WE GO.

53
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,208
HELP YOURSELF TO AS MANY
AS YOU LIKE, DEAR BROTHER.

54
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,416
EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE.

55
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,583
- MMM!  IT'S TIME TO EAT!

56
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:24,583
- TELL ME, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF SOMETHING CALLED AN ORGEL?

57
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:28,375
- AN ORGEL YOU SAY.
THAT'S SOME KIND OF MUSIC BOX.

58
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,625
- THAT'S RIGHT.  I BELIEVE
THAT'S THE COMMON NAME,

59
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,250
BUT I PREFER THE TERM "ORGEL,"

60
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:35,791
BECAUSE IT JUST SOUNDS
SO MUCH MORE ELEGANT.

61
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,250
- Sydonay: YOU'RE GOING TO
USE THAT TREASURE,

62
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,166
AND THE UNRESTRICTED METHOD
TO CREATE THE ENCLOSURE.

63
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,583
- IT HAS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL TONE.

64
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,333
- ( whistle blows )

65
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,875
- ( Yuji grunts )

66
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:58,125
MAN, DODGEBALL AT OUR AGE?

67
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,083
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SAKAI?

68
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,958
- YEAH, I'M JUST FINE.

69
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,500
- BOO-YAH!

70
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:23,583
( gasps ) OH!

71
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:27,166
- HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?
- TANAKA!

72
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,666
- IT'S COMING DOWN
IN BUCKETS OUT THERE.

73
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,666
- BUT I'M GLAD THE GAME
WAS CANCELLED.

74
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,250
THE WAY THINGS WERE GOING,
SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN HURT.

75
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,958
REALLY HURT.
- BIG SISTER.

76
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,875
- BIG SISTER?  WHO IS THAT?

77
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,750
- HE WAS REALLY KNOCKED
FOR A LOOP.

78
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,000
LISTEN, SAKAI.
- HMM?

79
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,375
- I WANNA ASK YOU ABOUT HIRAI.

80
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,041
- OKAY, WHAT DO YOU WANNA KNOW?

81
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,875
- YOU GUYS COME TO SCHOOL
TOGETHER PRETTY OFTEN.

82
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,833
LET'S SEE, IS THERE ANYTHING
BETWEEN YOU TWO?

83
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:11,416
- NO, NO,
THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON.

84
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

85
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,250
- Girl #1:
THEY SAY JUST ONE KISS.

86
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,416
IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU GIVE AWAY
LIKE IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

87
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
-  Girl #2: I TOTALLY KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

88
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,500
YOU LET THEM KISS YOU,
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,

89
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,500
THEY'VE GONE TOO FAR.
- Girl #1: WHAT?

90
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,208
- Girl #2:
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

91
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,500
IT'S LIKE, A KISS IS PRECIOUS.

92
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:45,458
- Girl #1: HUH?
OH, THAT'S WHAT YOU MEANT.

93
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,541
- Girl #2:
IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT TO DO.

94
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,166
- Girl #1: SURE, IT IS.

95
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,666
- HUH?

96
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,541
A KISS.

97
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:02,291
YUJI HAD A STRANGE REACTION WHEN
WE TALKED ABOUT THAT YESTERDAY.

98
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:15,750
EVERYTHING I'VE READ HERE MAKES
IT SOUND STRAIGHTFORWARD.

99
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:19,708
( sighs ) BUT STILL.

100
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,166
- Yuji: AH, HERE YOU ARE.

101
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,791
- SO YOU DOING SOME RESEARCH?
- YEAH, SORT OF.

102
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,541
- ON WHAT?

103
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,208
- STUFF, YOU KNOW,
NOTHING THAT IMPORTANT.

104
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,625
- DON'T LOOK SO WORRIED,
YOSHIDA.

105
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,333
- IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS.
- IT ISN'T?

106
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,833
- IT'S LIKE WHAT
I WAS TELLING YOU BEFORE.

107
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,916
HIRAI AND SAKAI ARE
JUST GOOD FRIENDS.

108
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
THEY'RE NOT IN LOVE
WITH EACH OTHER.

109
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,250
SO HANG IN THERE.

110
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,166
- OKAY.

111
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,458
BIG SISTER, WE'RE HOME!

112
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,583
SO HOW YOU FEELING TODAY?

113
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,208
- WOULD YOU TWO BE QUIET?

114
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,166
IT FEELS LIKE MY HEAD
IS SPLITTING WIDE OPEN.

115
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:07,208
- YO, EITA, WHAT'S WITH
THE WAR WOUND ON YOUR CHIN?

116
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,333
- THIS?  OH, I TOOK A BALL
IN THE FACE TODAY.

117
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,791
- KEISAKU, EITA,

118
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,125
I THINK I'M GROWING TIRED
OF BOOZE.

119
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,333
- OH.

120
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,791
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

121
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,750
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"

122
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,625
- I'M WONDERING, WHAT IS
THE REAL MEANING OF A KISS?

123
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,250
- OH, WHY DO YOU WANNA KNOW
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

124
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,166
- JUST BECAUSE.

125
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,791
- A SIMPLE QUESTION, BUT IT'S
A DIFFICULT ONE TO ANSWER.

126
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,583
YOU SAID YOU DID
SOME RESEARCH?

127
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,666
- I LOOKED THROUGH A BUNCH
OF LIBRARY BOOKS,

128
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,333
BUT I DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING
THAT I DON'T ALREADY KNOW.

129
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,166
I'M AWARE OF WHAT'S INVOLVED,
AND I'VE SEEN PEOPLE KISSING,

130
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,833
BUT IT'S LIKE--
- LIKE WHAT?

131
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,875
- I GET THE FEELING THAT
THE MEANING I ATTACH TO A KISS

132
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,125
AND THE MEANING EVERYONE ELSE
HAS ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.

133
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,333
I THOUGHT YOU COULD TELL ME
WHAT A KISS IS REALLY ABOUT.

134
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,666
- HAVE YOU READ NOVELS
OR MAGAZINES ABOUT IT?

135
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,500
- I HAVE, BUT ALASTOR
SAID THOSE THINGS ARE USELESS

136
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,416
BECAUSE ANYTHING WRITTEN DOWN
HAS A PERSONAL OPINION IN IT,

137
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,708
AND IT WON'T BE VERY ANALYTICAL
OR LOGICAL.

138
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,750
- ALASTOR IS YOUR GUARDIAN,
RIGHT?

139
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,666
HE'S THE ONE WHO LIVES
A LONG WAY AWAY.

140
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,000
HE SOUNDS VERY INSIGHTFUL.
- OH, HE IS.

141
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:20,416
- HOWEVER,
IT'S NOT QUITE SO SIMPLE.

142
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,375
- OH.

143
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,125
- HOWEVER, SHANA-CHAN,
SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

144
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,333
IT'S NATURAL FOR YOU
TO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT IT.

145
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,958
- I GUESS SO.

146
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:43,541
- IF YOU WANT ACCURATE
INFORMATION AND THEORIES,

147
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,625
BOOKS ARE THE BEST THINGS
TO START WITH.

148
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,250
BUT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
HAS VERY LITTLE TO DO

149
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,666
WITH COLD FACTS AND FIGURES.

150
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,875
IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS
SOMETHING WITH NO RIGHT ANSWER.

151
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,208
IT HAS TO DO WITH THE HEART
AND EMOTIONS.

152
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,625
- THE HEART AND EMOTIONS?

153
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,791
- YOU DO UNDERSTAND THAT
PHYSICAL CONTACT

154
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:04,708
BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE IS USUALLY
A SIGN OF AFFECTION, RIGHT?

155
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,958
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT A KISS IS.

156
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:10,125
KIND OF LIKE WHEN PEOPLE SHAKE
HANDS OR HUG EACH OTHER.

157
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,125
EVERYONE DOES IT.

158
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:15,875
- HMM, WELL, THAT'S TRUE,
BUT LET'S TAKE ALASTOR.

159
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,416
YOU WOULDN'T MIND GIVING HIM
A LITTLE KISS, RIGHT?

160
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,291
WOULD YOU GIVE YU-CHAN A KISS?

161
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,208
- BUT-- BUT HE'S--

162
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,958
- WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT
IT LIKE THAT,

163
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,875
IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE ISN'T IT?
- YEAH.

164
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,583
- THAT'S THE ESSENCE
OF WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY.

165
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,875
- AND REMEMBER THAT A HARMLESS
PECK ON THE CHEEK

166
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,375
IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING
FROM TWO PEOPLE

167
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,666
KISSING EACH OTHER
ON THE LIPS.

168
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,750
- A KISS ON THE LIPS?
FROM YUJI?

169
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,666
NO, I DON'T EVER
WANNA DO THAT.

170
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,041
- THAT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.

171
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:56,125
- CHIGUSA--
- NO ONE SAYS YOU HAVE TO.

172
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,791
IN FACT, IT'S PROBABLY NOT
SOMETHING YOU SHOULD BE DOING

173
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,916
- WITH ALASTOR, EITHER.
- ( gasps )

174
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,708
- SHANA-CHAN, THIS IS HOW
I FEEL ABOUT A KISS.

175
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:09,333
IF IT'S ON THE LIPS,
THEN IT'S LIKE A PERSONAL OATH.

176
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,333
- AN OATH?

177
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,791
- YES, IT MEANS THE TWO
OF YOU WANT TO BE CLOSER,

178
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,875
THAT YOU'RE WILLING
TO LET THE OTHER PERSON

179
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,291
TAKE CARE OF YOU.

180
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,791
- SO THAT'S IT.

181
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,916
- THAT'S ENOUGH FOR TONIGHT.

182
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,416
- ( sighs )
I AM A LITTLE TIRED.

183
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:45,416
SHANA, I'VE BEEN WONDERING.
- ABOUT WHAT?

184
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,875
- MY ENERGY MAKES A COMPLETE
RECOVERY EVERY NIGHT,

185
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,791
BECAUSE OF THE MIDNIGHT
LOST CHILD TREASURE.

186
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,333
- YEAH, SO?

187
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,041
- DOES THAT MEAN
I'M GOING TO LIVE FOREVER?

188
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,500
- THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'LL HAVE
TO FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF.

189
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,666
IT'LL BE A WHILE BEFORE
YOU KNOW FOR CERTAIN.

190
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,666
- I SEE.
- WHAT IS IT?

191
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,875
- I WAS WONDERING IF THIS MEANS

192
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,583
THAT NOW WE'RE ALWAYS
GOING TO BE TOGETHER.

193
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,041
- Alastor: SHANA.
- WHAT?

194
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,500
- I HAVE A FAVOR TO ASK OF YOU.
OF BOTH OF YOU.

195
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,625
- SO IS THIS OKAY, ALASTOR?

196
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,291
- HMM.

197
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,750
- CHIGUSA,
CAN I USE YOUR PHONE?

198
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:40,916
- GO AHEAD, BUT, SHANA-CHAN,
IT'S ALMOST TIME FOR SCHOOL.

199
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,666
- RIGHT.

200
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,250
- ( cellphone rings )
- HELLO.

201
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,666
- HMM, ALL RIGHT,
LET'S BEGIN.

202
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,375
- CHIGUSA.
- FOR ME?

203
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,208
- HELLO, YOU WANTED
TO TALK TO ME?

204
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,375
- HELLO.
- YES.

205
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,375
- MADAME, IT IS A GREAT PLEASURE
TO FINALLY BE ABLE

206
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,166
TO SPEAK WITH YOU. 
MY NAME IS ALASTOR.

207
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:07,166
- AH, SO THIS
IS THE FAMOUS MR. ALASTOR.

208
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,625
YUKARI'S TOLD ME ALL ABOUT YOU.
SHE SPEAKS VERY HIGHLY OF YOU.

209
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:14,625
I'M YUJI'S MOTHER, BUT YOU CAN
CALL ME CHIGUSA.  EVERYONE DOES.

210
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,791
- I WANT
TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY

211
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,958
TO THANK YOU
FOR LOOKING OUT FOR HER.

212
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,833
- OH, NO, I HAVEN'T
DONE THAT MUCH.

213
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,208
PLEASE DON'T THINK I'M BEING
TOO FORWARD,

214
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,125
BUT MAY I ASK WHY YOU WANTED
TO SPEAK TO ME?

215
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,250
I'M SURE THIS HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH YUKARI HIRAI.

216
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,416
- INDEED IT DOES.

217
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,958
AND PLEASE FEEL FREE
TO CALL HER SHANA.

218
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,958
THAT'S THE NAME I USE
WHEN ADDRESSING HER.

219
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:43,666
- AH, SO IT'S A PERSONAL
NICKNAME THAT YOU GAVE HER.

220
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,250
- WELL, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

221
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,041
- ABOUT THE REASON
FOR MY TELEPHONE CALL.

222
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,541
- YES.

223
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:52,250
- IT HAS TO DO
WITH WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY.

224
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,333
- YESTERDAY?
HUH?

225
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,750
- COULD YOU HOLD ON
A MOMENT PLEASE?

226
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:03,291
- YU-CHAN, SHANA-CHAN, YOU'RE
GOING TO BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.

227
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,875
- Both: WE'RE GOING NOW.
- GO, I'LL SEE YOU LATER, OKAY?

228
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,208
HURRY UP, GET GOING.

229
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,916
I'M SORRY
TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

230
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,833
- I AM NOT DISPUTING YOUR
KNOWLEDGE WHEN IT COMES

231
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:18,583
TO RELATIONSHIPS, HOWEVER,
I MUST ASK THAT YOU REFRAIN

232
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,625
FROM CONVERSATIONS
OF THAT NATURE.

233
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,125
- OH, I SEE.

234
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,958
THEN SHE MUST HAVE TALKED
TO YOU ABOUT IT.

235
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:27,708
- NO, MORE LIKE I TEASED
IT OUT OF HER.

236
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,666
- WELL, WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS
THAT SHANA WAS STILL WILLING

237
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,083
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

238
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,958
IT SHOWS HOW MUCH SHE TRUSTS YOU

239
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,500
AND RESPECTS YOUR OPINION.
- HMM.

240
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,333
- IT'S CLEAR YOU CARE FOR HER.

241
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,625
YOU'VE DONE A WONDERFUL
JOB RAISING HER.

242
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,416
SHE'S A LOVELY YOUNG GIRL
WITH A GOOD HEART.

243
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,125
- THAT SHE IS, AND THAT'S
PRECISELY WHY I MUST ASK YOU

244
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,625
TO DESIST FROM
ANY FURTHER DISCUSSIONS

245
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,916
THAT COULD STIMULATE IMPROPER
THOUGHTS

246
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,291
CONCERNING YOUR SON YUJI.

247
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,666
- HMM.  YES, I UNDERSTAND
YOUR CONCERN.

248
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,166
- YOU ARE AN ASTUTE WOMAN,
MADAME.

249
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,875
I'M SURE YOU CAN IMAGINE EXACTLY
WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT HERE.

250
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,125
- YES, BUT--
- HMM?

251
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,291
- FOR SHANA-CHAN'S SAKE,

252
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,833
MAY I HAVE PERMISSION TO TALK
TO HER ABOUT THIS SUBJECT

253
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,041
SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE?
- OKAY.

254
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:16,916
- WITH YOUR GUIDANCE,
SHE'S BECOME A PROUD, STRONG

255
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,208
AND GOOD-HEARTED YOUNG WOMAN,
BUT LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES. 

256
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,875
SHE'S STILL VERY YOUNG
AND INSECURE ABOUT SOME THINGS.

257
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:29,500
- HMM, PLEASE CONTINUE.

258
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:34,208
- WELL, FORGIVE ME,
BUT I HAVE TO BE FRANK.

259
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:37,083
I DON'T THINK SHE UNDERSTANDS
FEELINGS VERY WELL,

260
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,375
AND SHE'S EXTREMELY VULNERABLE
WHEN IT COMES

261
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,291
TO MATTERS OF THE HEART.

262
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,291
IMAGINE A YOUNG MAN,

263
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:46,958
SOMEONE AGGRESSIVE
OR EVEN MY OWN SON YUJI.

264
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:50,333
SHE'S JUST SO NAIVE.
I DON'T THINK SHE COULD RESIST.

265
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:54,125
YESTERDAY SHE SAID SOME THINGS
THAT WORRIED ME.

266
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,750
THAT'S WHY I HAD
TO TALK WITH HER.

267
00:17:56,833 --> 00:18:00,375
- DON'T YOU THINK IT'S STILL TOO
EARLY FOR THESE KINDS OF TALKS?

268
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,083
I'D ALWAYS PLANNED TO GRADUALLY
INTRODUCE THESE THINGS

269
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,291
OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS
IN RESPONSE TO NEW

270
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,708
AND INTERESTING EXPERIENCES
IN HER LIFE.

271
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:12,000
- PROBLEMS DON'T ARISE WHEN WE'D
LIKE THEM TO, NOW DO THEY?

272
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,708
- INDEED THEY DO NOT.

273
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,916
- THEREFORE, THERE ARE
SOME THINGS THAT CHILDREN

274
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
ARE NEVER TOO YOUNG TO LEARN,

275
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,791
ESPECIALLY IF IT'S SOMETHING
THAT THEY HAVE TO KNOW.

276
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,458
IT'S FOR HER OWN SAKE.

277
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:27,833
BESIDES, GIRLS CAN
BE QUITE PRECOCIOUS.

278
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,000
THEY'RE MORE MATURE
THAN THEY APPEAR.

279
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,708
- MADAME.
- YES.

280
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:39,416
- PLEASE ALLOW ME
TO RETRACT MY EARLIER REMARKS.

281
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,916
THEY WERE ILL-INFORMED.

282
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,208
- WELL, I HOPE YOU'LL FORGIVE ME
FOR HAVING BEEN SO DIRECT,

283
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,250
BUT I WOULDN'T WORRY
ABOUT SHANA-CHAN.

284
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,541
WITH THE PROPER CARE
AND GUIDANCE,

285
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,750
SHE'LL BE READY
FOR WHATEVER HAPPENS.

286
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,916
SHE CAN FIND THE RIGHT ANSWERS
IN HER OWN WAY,

287
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,125
AND YOU TRUST HER
IN THAT REGARD, DON'T YOU?

288
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,083
- OF COURSE I DO.

289
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,666
- OH, BROTHER.

290
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,708
HUH?

291
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:15,166
- Sorath:
IT'S CLOSE. REALLY CLOSE.

292
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,958
- WHAT IS IT, SYDONAY?

293
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:20,958
YOU SEEM TO BE LOOKING FOR
SOMETHING.  COULD IT BE--

294
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,958
- I'M ALWAYS AMAZED
AT HOW SORATH CAN SMELL

295
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,791
THE THINGS THAT HE WANTS.

296
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,416
THIS UNPLEASANT SENSATION MEANS
THERE'S A FLAME HAZE NEARBY.

297
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,208
- HUH?  WHAT?
WHERE'S THE FLAME HAZE?

298
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,000
WHERE IS IT?  WHERE IS IT?
I WANT IT REAL BAD.

299
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,083
- AND IT'S NOT ALONE.
- HUH?

300
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,833
- IT'S GOING TO
DETECT US ANY SECOND NOW.

301
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,958
- IT'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
WE KNEW IT WAS ONLY A MATTER

302
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,583
OF TIME BEFORE WE EVENTUALLY
RAN ACROSS A FLAME HAZE.

303
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,916
- FINE THEN.
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

304
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,833
- I WANTED MORE TIME TO PREPARE
SOME WELCOMING TRAPS,

305
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,583
BUT I THINK WE'LL BE FINE.

306
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:55,666
SO SHALL WE GET THIS UNDERWAY,
DEAR BROTHER?

307
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,250
BUT FIRST,
I THINK IT'S ONLY POLITE

308
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,166
THAT WE GO
AND PAY THEM A SOCIAL CALL.

309
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,333
'CAUSE AFTER ALL,
IT WON'T BE HARD TO FIND THEM.

310
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,416
- I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED
YESTERDAY.

311
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,333
- YEAH, REMEMBER WHEN ALASTOR
WAS ON THE PHONE?

312
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,458
HE SAID SOMETHING
HAPPENED YESTERDAY.

313
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,500
- I DON'T KNOW.
- HUH?

314
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,333
WHAT IS IT, SHANA?

315
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,791
- I PROMISED THAT I'M NEVER EVER
GOING TO DO IT WITH YOU.

316
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,291
- HEY, CARE FOR
A LITTLE COMPANY?

317
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,916
- HERE YOU GO, SAKAI.

318
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,166
I MADE YOU A LUNCH IF YOU WANT
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

319
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,250
- THAT'S FOR ME?
- YEAH, BECAUSE ALL YOU EVER EAT

320
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,750
AT LUNCH ARE RICE BALLS.
THAT'S WHY.

321
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,666
- SURE.

322
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,458
I APPRECIATE IT.

323
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,291
THANKS FOR LUNCH!

324
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,958
- ( sighs )

325
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:59,958
- OH, MAN, WHAT DO I START WITH?
IT ALL LOOKS GOOD.

326
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,250
I--

327
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,541
- YEP, YOU'RE SURE BUYING
A LOT OF STUFF.

328
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,000
- THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

329
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:18,500
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I'M JUST GETTING STARTED.

330
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,625
- Marco:
THIS ISN'T THE BEST TIME

331
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,250
TO RUN INTO SUCH HEAVY VISITORS.

332
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,708
- WHO ARE THOSE GUYS?

333
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,916
- BIG SISTER.

334
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,166
- IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE I LAST SAW YOU,

335
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,833
BEAUTIFUL SLAUGHTERER.

336
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:49,958
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
YOU OUT OF SHAPE CASANOVA?

337
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,166
- YOU KNOW HER?

338
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,625
- INDEED, LET ME INTRODUCE
HER TO YOU, TIRIEL.

339
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:59,041
THE FLAME HAZE MARGERY DAW,
THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

340
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:02,333
AS FAR AS KILLERS GO,
I'D SAY SHE'S PROBABLY THE BEST.

341
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:05,333
- WELL, THE CLAWS AND FANGS
OF VIOLATION.

342
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,458
- BUT I DON'T CARE WHO THEY ARE.

343
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,041
THEY DON'T HAVE
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR.

344
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,791
- OH, I THOUGHT MAYBE
WE'D GOTTEN LUCKY,

345
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,833
BUT I GUESS THIS IS JUST
A RANDOM ENCOUNTER.

346
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:20,958
- SO LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
- IF YOU INSIST, DEAR BROTHER.

347
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,791
- THOSE THREE ARE DENIZENS.

348
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,666
- SHOULD WE REALLY BE
LETTING THEM GO?

349
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,500
- WE DIDN'T LET THEM GO.

350
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,833
THEY LET US GO.

351
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,958
- SHUT UP, STUPID MARCO.

352
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:45,208
- SO WHAT DID YOU TALK
TO MY MOTHER ABOUT?

353
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:48,833
- NOTHING THAT YOU NEED
TO BE CONCERNED WITH.

354
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:51,250
YOU NEED TO FOCUS
ON YOUR TRAINING MORE.

355
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:54,291
YOU DON'T WANT TO EMBARRASS
YOUR MOTHER, NOW DO YOU?

356
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,041
- NO.

357
00:22:57,666 --> 00:23:00,208
- YU-CHAN, SHANA-CHAN, COME IN,
DINNER'S READY.

358
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,833
- OKAY.
- YEAH, OKAY, MOM.

359
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:08,208
- Both: HUH?

360
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:14,125
- WHOA.
- I'LL NEVER DO IT WITH YOU.

361
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:15,625
- HMM?

362
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:21,083
- HMM, I WONDER
WHERE IT COULD BE,

363
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,083
THE NIETONO NO SHANA.

364
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:28,791
- ( woman singing in Japanese )


365
00:24:56,041 --> 00:25:00,083
- Yuji: THE GIRL WHO HAS
FEELINGS FOR YUJI DECLARES WAR.

366
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,708
A CHALLENGE THAT SHANA ACCEPTS.

367
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,958
THAT'S WHEN TIRIEL
MAKES HER MOVE,

368
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:06,500
AND ENGULFED IN LOVE FOR OTHERS,
SPRINGS HER TRAP.

369
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:07,916
NEXT EPISODE...
