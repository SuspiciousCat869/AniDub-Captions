1
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,875
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:38,250
LIVES CONSUMED
IN SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.

3
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:41,375
NO ONE CAN TELL
WHEN THE WORLD IS DISPLACED

4
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:45,916
AND THE FLAMES OF THE
CRIMSON WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,666
- ( theme music playing )

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,125
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

7
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,750
- NOW I WONDER
WHERE HE'S HIDING.

8
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,083
- Marco: WE'VE SEALED
THE PLACE OFF,

9
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:37,625
SO THE ONLY THING MOVING AROUND
IS GONNA BE THAT DENIZEN SCUM.

10
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,000
- HMM.

11
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,166
- THEY FINALLY FOUND ME.

12
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,041
- AAH!

13
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,791
HELLO, CORPSE COLLECTOR.

14
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,416
THE TIME OF YOUR DEMISE
HAS FINALLY COME.

15
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,625
- ( Marco laughing ) WE JUST
WANNA GIVE YOU A LITTLE KISS.

16
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,166
A KISS YOU ONLY GET
ONCE IN A LIFETIME.

17
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,541
- SHOULD I USE IT?

18
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,000
NO.

19
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,208
- OOH, THINKING OF FIGHTING?

20
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,375
- Marco: BRING IT ON.
IT'S YOUR CHOICE,

21
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,583
ALTHOUGH IT WON'T CHANGE
THE OUTCOME.

22
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,208
- BE CONFUSED.

23
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,625
- NICE.

24
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:09,500
- Marco: OH, BRAVO.
WELL DONE, WHOOPEE!

25
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,750
THERE'S SO MANY LITTLE BIRDIES,
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.

26
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,375
YEAH, RIGHT!
HYAH!

27
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,625
- DID YOU REALLY THINK
A PATHETIC TRICK LIKE THAT

28
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,583
WOULD WORK AGAINST US?

29
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,833
- Marco:
SAY YOUR PRAYERS, SCUM!

30
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,458
- HUH?

31
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,208
YOU LITTLE BRAT.
WHEN DID YOU GET HERE?

32
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,458
- ALLOW ME
TO REINTRODUCE MYSELF.

33
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,791
I AM THE FLAMING-HAIRED
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER,

34
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,291
THE PARTNER OF ALASTOR,

35
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,250
HE WHO IS KNOWN
AS THE FLAME OF HEAVENS.

36
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,666
I AM SHANA!

37
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,166
- SO SHE IS WITH THE FLAME
OF THE HEAVENS. I SEE.

38
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,791
- HA!  YOUR TRICK
WORKED ON US, AFTER ALL.

39
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,333
WITH ALL THOSE FLAPPING WINGS,
WE COULDN'T SENSE

40
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,375
THE LITTLE BRAT
MOVING IN CLOSER.

41
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,958
- Marco:
WELL, CORPSE COLLECTOR,

42
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,000
YOU'RE GOING TO PAY
FOR THAT TRICK!

43
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,583
- GET BACK.
- Lamies: IT'S YOU AGAIN.

44
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,208
- KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF HIM.
- HA!

45
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,500
LOOKS LIKE YOU BROUGHT ALONG
SOMEONE TO HELP YOU.

46
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,791
- Marco: A MYSTES, AND HE CAN
MOVE INSIDE THE SEAL.

47
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,791
- I THINK I KNOW
WHAT'S INSIDE YOU.

48
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,041
- LET'S TALK ABOUT IT LATER,
OKAY?

49
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,291
- MAKE YOUR CHOICE--

50
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,541
EITHER LEAVE LAMIES THE CORPSE
COLLECTOR ALONE,

51
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,708
OR PREPARE TO BE HURT.

52
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,958
- SOMEONE'S OVER-CONFIDENT.

53
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,166
DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO STOP US?

54
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,750
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S GONNA GET HURT HERE.

55
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,750
IS PROTECTING A DENIZEN
REALLY WORTH IT?

56
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,041
- IT IS THE DUTY
OF A FLAME HAZE.

57
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,791
THERE'S A RISK THE CITY
COULD BE SEVERELY DAMAGED

58
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,291
IF YOU DESTROY HIM.

59
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,708
- HE'S A DENIZEN.

60
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,958
IT'S MORE DANGEROUS
TO LEAVE HIM ALIVE.

61
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,750
- LAMIES IS HARMLESS.

62
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:00,041
- A DENIZEN
WHO DOESN'T CAUSE ANY HARM?

63
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,458
YOU DON'T SERIOUSLY EXPECT ME
TO BELIEVE THAT.

64
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,666
- I'M NOT GONNA
GET INTO AN ARGUMENT,

65
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,583
AND I DON'T INTEND
TO LECTURE YOU EITHER.

66
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,333
JUST HURRY UP
AND MAKE YOUR DECISION.

67
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,166
EITHER BACK AWAY
OR YOU'LL GET HURT.

68
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,416
- YOU LITTLE BRAT!
- ( Marco laughing )

69
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,291
YOU WANT AN ANSWER,
WE CHOOSE NUMBER THREE.

70
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,333
WE'RE GONNA KICK YOUR BUTTS!

71
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,041
- WE'LL KILL YOU ALL!

72
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,708
- WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME TO TRY.

73
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,833
- OH, GOOD, LOOKS LIKE
YOU'VE RAISED YOUR GAME

74
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,875
TO THE POINT IT'S GOING
TO BE FUN KILLING YOU.

75
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,333
- Marco: INDEED SHE HAS.
( laughs )

76
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,750
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?
LET'S DO IT!

77
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,958
LET'S CREAM 'EM!

78
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,500
- SHANA, LOOK OUT!

79
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,000
- THAT WAS WELL DONE.
- HUH?

80
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,375
- SHE'S ANTAGONIZED THEM
TO THE POINT

81
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,458
WHERE THEY'RE FOCUSING ENTIRELY
ON HER AND IGNORING US.

82
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,750
- OH.

83
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,541
- SHANA.

84
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:11,083
- LET'S PLAY A LITTLE
SALLY GO ROUND THE MOON!

85
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:14,250
- ( Marco laughing )

86
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,625
- THAT ONE.

87
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,416
AAH!

88
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,416
- SHE GUESSED RIGHT.

89
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,375
- Marco: BEHIND YOU.

90
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,208
- Margery: SHE'S QUICK!

91
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,041
THINK YOU'RE SMART?

92
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,500
- I FEEL STRONGER
BECAUSE YUJI'S HERE.

93
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,250
I CAN DO ANYTHING!

94
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,416
- Marco: DAMN IT,
SHE WON'T STAND STILL.

95
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,375
DAMN IT!

96
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,291
- YOU READY TO GIVE UP YET?

97
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,375
- ( laughs )
YOU FIRST.

98
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,250
YOU SAID IT WAS YOUR MISSION

99
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,208
TO PROTECT
THAT WORTHLESS WORM LAMIES.

100
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,791
A FLAME HAZE'S REAL MISSION
IS TO GET RID OF THE DENIZENS.

101
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,291
- YOU'RE WRONG.

102
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,166
OUR JOB IS TO MAINTAIN THE
BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO WORLDS.

103
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,208
AND TO KEEP THE BALANCE,
I'VE GOTTEN RID OF

104
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,875
MANY HARMFUL DENIZENS
WITHOUT HESITATION.

105
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:30,000
BUT YOU GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO
KILL THEM, BECAUSE YOU LIKE IT!

106
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,708
- WHO ARE YOU TO TELL ME
WHAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT'S WRONG?

107
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,750
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH, BRAT!

108
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,166
- YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT.

109
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,166
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOUR REASONS ARE.

110
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,333
AND I REALLY
DON'T CARE EITHER.

111
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,125
TO ME,
YOU'RE JUST A PAIN IN THE ASS.

112
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,166
- WHY YOU LITTLE--
( grunts )

113
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,083
- Marco: MARGERY, HEY!

114
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,666
- DON'T WORRY,
I'VE GOT IT UNDER CONTROL.

115
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,208
THERE REALLY IS SOMETHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT HER.

116
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,166
BUT IT'S NOT
HER FIGHTING STYLE,

117
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,958
IT'S LIKE
THERE'S SOMETHING WITHIN HER.

118
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:00,875
SOMETHING HAS GIVEN HER
THIS IRRITATING CONFIDENCE.

119
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,083
AH!
COULD IT BE THAT?

120
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,125
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

121
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:13,208
RAIN ON THE GREEN GRASS
WHERE I CAN SEE,

122
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:17,041
RAIN RAIN EVERYWHERE,
BUT NOT UPON ME!

123
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,583
ATTACK!

124
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:53,208
- HUH?
THE FIRE-REPELLING RING.

125
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,083
- HOW DID HE SURVIVE THAT?

126
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,916
- Marco: HERE SHE COMES!

127
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,833
- AAH!

128
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,541
- DID YOU THINK I'D
ACTUALLY BE STUPID ENOUGH

129
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,125
TO LEAVE YUJI UNGUARDED?

130
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:11,375
- YOU MEAN YOU WERE WAITING FOR
ME TO TARGET HIM ALL THIS TIME?

131
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,041
- YAH!

132
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,750
- ( grunting )

133
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,291
- Marco: LOOK OUT,

134
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,541
THE UNRESTRICTED METHOD
IS COLLAPSING!

135
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,166
- BIG SISTER.

136
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,250
YOU THINK SHE PULLED IT OFF?

137
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,541
YOU KNOW,
GOT RID OF THAT DENIZEN?

138
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,625
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW?
- YOU WANNA GO CHECK IT OUT?

139
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,000
- WHY? WHAT FOR?

140
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,125
- AREN'T YOU THE LEAST BIT
WORRIED ABOUT HER?

141
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:24,416
- THINK ABOUT IT. WHAT WOULD BE
THE POINT OF US GOIN' OUT THERE?

142
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,833
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE DUMPED US
IF WE WERE STILL USEFUL.

143
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,250
- I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

144
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,916
- COME ON.

145
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,250
- ( crashing )

146
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,458
- ( grunting )

147
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,000
- AAH!
- YOUNG MAN!

148
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,458
- AAH!

149
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,666
- YUJI!
- SHANA!

150
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,750
SHANA.

151
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,583
- YUJI.  AH.

152
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,291
YUJI, LOWER YOUR PROTECTION
WHEN I JUMP.

153
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,541
OTHERWISE MY FLAME WON'T WORK.

154
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,916
- Alastor: WAIT, IF YOU DISSOLVE
IT NOW, WE'RE AN EASY TARGET.

155
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,958
- YOU CAN FALL DOWN,
OR YOU CAN GET SHOT DOWN.

156
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,125
THIS TIME IT'S YOUR TURN
TO DECIDE.  HMM?

157
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,625
- WELL WELL. THIS IS A SIGHT
YOU DON'T SEE TOO OFTEN.

158
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:33,125
HMM, THOUGH I'D LOVE TO STAY
AND SEE HOW IT TURNS OUT,

159
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,041
I'M AFRAID I REALLY
MUST BE GOING.

160
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,041
- Marco: YOU'RE NOT GETTING AWAY
THAT EASILY!

161
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,625
- OKAY, DROP YOUR PROTECTION!

162
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,125
- AAH!

163
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,541
- I CAN DO ANYTHING!

164
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,916
- AAH!

165
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,250
SHANA!  THE BUILDING!
- Alastor: CALM YOURSELF.

166
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,625
SHE'LL HAVE CONTROL
IN A MOMENT.

167
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,791
- YUJI, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO HOLD ON TO ME.

168
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,250
I CAN'T FLY LIKE THIS.

169
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,416
- I GOTCHA.

170
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,708
- HUH?

171
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:22,291
YUJI.
I CAN DO ANYTHING.

172
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:31,416
- THERE'S NOWHERE LEFT
FOR YOU TO RUN TO, LAMIES.

173
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,375
- Marco: THIS GAME OF HIDE AND
SEEK HAS GONE ON FAR TOO LONG.

174
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,166
- ( grunting )

175
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,833
- Marco: WHAT THE HELL?

176
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,083
- ( screaming )

177
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,166
- Margery:
BEFORE, I NEVER HAD ANYTHING

178
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,208
THAT WAS WORTH A DAMN.

179
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:08,000
I HAD MY LIFE, BUT EVERYTHING
ELSE HAD BEEN TAKEN.

180
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:11,750
SO I JUST WANTED
TO TEAR EVERYTHING DOWN.

181
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,583
I WAS GOING TO RIDICULE,
DESTROY,

182
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,583
STEAL AND KILL EVERYONE.

183
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,833
BUT EVEN THAT
WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM ME.

184
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,416
HE TOOK IT AWAY.

185
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,916
JUST BECAUSE
HE WANTED TO SHOW ME

186
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,041
THAT I NO LONGER
HAD ANYTHING LEFT TO DESTROY,

187
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,833
THAT I WAS EMPTY.

188
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:35,125
IF ONLY I COULD HURT HIM.
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

189
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,875
JUST HIM.

190
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,958
- Marco:
GO ON, FINISH THE THOUGHT.

191
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,583
YOU'RE AN EMPTY CONTAINER,

192
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,791
A BEAUTIFUL VESSEL
WITH AN ULTRAMARINE FINISH.

193
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,833
- Margery: WHO ARE YOU?
 - Marco: CALL FOR ME.

194
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:52,833
IN A MURDEROUS SHOUT,
CALL FOR ME.

195
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,791
MY VESSEL,
I WILL FILL YOU UP,

196
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,500
AND YOU WILL CARRY OUT
MY WILL.

197
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:04,041
THAT'S RIGHT, CALL FOR ME,

198
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,750
MY BEAUTIFUL GOBLET.

199
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,708
- HUH?

200
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:12,583
AAH!

201
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:23,000
( roaring )
- Yuji: WHAT IS THAT?

202
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,916
- Alastor:
THAT IS THE MANIFESTATION

203
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,958
OF THE CLAWS AND FANGS
OF VIOLATION.

204
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,833
- ( growling )

205
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,708
- HE'S RAGING OUT OF CONTROL.

206
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,125
AT THIS RATE,
HE'LL SHATTER THE SEAL.

207
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:43,166
- WHAT'LL HAPPEN THEN?
- YOU CANNOT REPAIR THE DAMAGE

208
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,791
ONCE THIS TOUCHES
THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

209
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,333
EVERYONE IN THE SEAL WOULD
PERISH. - EVERYONE?

210
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,125
- AND RIGHT NOW HIS HATRED
AND HIS RAGE

211
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,291
ARE SPILLING FORTH
OUT OF CONTROL.

212
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,208
SUCH A DISPLAY
MUST BE HAVING

213
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,625
SOME KIND OF EFFECT
OUTSIDE THE SEAL.

214
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,375
- Alastor: BUT HE'S PAST
THE POINT

215
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,291
WHERE HE'S WILLING
TO LISTEN TO REASON.

216
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,291
- THEN WE'LL JUST HAVE TO
HIT HIM UNTIL HE DOES LISTEN.

217
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,416
YUJI.

218
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,083
- I'M READY TO HELP.
JUST GIVE ME THE WORD.

219
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:13,083
- OKAY.

220
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,458
I'M GONNA FLY US
AS CLOSE AS I CAN.

221
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,708
WHEN I GIVE THE WORD,
USE THE RING TO PROTECT US.

222
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:18,875
- I UNDERSTAND.

223
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:31,333
UH, RIGHT.  I'M GONNA GRAB
ONTO YOU NOW, OKAY?

224
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:34,583
- HURRY UP!
- UH...

225
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,166
- I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING
IF YOU'RE THERE.

226
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,791
- OH, YEAH, SORRY.
AH!

227
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:44,166
MY FACE IS GETTING SQUISHED.
AH!

228
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,541
- THE INSTANT I ATTACK,

229
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,583
I WANT YOU TO PROTECT US
WITH THE AZURE RING.

230
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,291
WAIT FOR MY SIGN.

231
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,666
- Yuji: YOU THINK IT'LL WORK?

232
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,000
- IT WILL.

233
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,333
- RIGHT.

234
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,416
- I STILL HAVE THE FEELING
I CAN DO ANYTHING.

235
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,958
- ( squeals )
- DO IT NOW!

236
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,166
- Yuji: JUST THEN,
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

237
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,458
I KNEW WHAT SHANA MEANT
WHEN SHE SAID TO FEEL THE KILL.

238
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,416
- ( object striking )

239
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,000
- Marco: HEY.

240
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,708
- I THINK I'M STILL ALIVE.

241
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,375
- Marco:
YEAH, YOU AND ME BOTH.

242
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,333
- I'M SURPRISED
YOU DIDN'T KILL US.

243
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,375
- I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE HESITATED.

244
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,750
IT'S A GOOD THING
WE'RE DIFFERENT THAN YOU.

245
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,791
- BECAUSE FLAME HAZES
DON'T DO THAT?

246
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,875
- YES, THAT'S NOT PART
OF OUR DUTY.

247
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:01,458
I HURT YOU JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP
YOU FROM CHASING AFTER LAMIES.

248
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,000
I STOPPED YOU, AND THAT IS
AS FAR AS I NEED TO GO.

249
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,375
- YOU GO ON AND ON
ABOUT YOUR MISSION,

250
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,083
LIKE YOU'RE A CRIMSON LORD.
DISGUSTING.

251
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,000
- YEAH,
WELL, I DON'T LIKE YOU EITHER.

252
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,875
- HA.  WOULD YOU TWO
STOP ACTING LIKE CHILDREN?

253
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:19,000
- WHAT IS HE ANYWAY?
IT'S NOT FAIR.  ( gasps )

254
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:22,958
- DON'T WORRY. I HAVE
NO INTENTION OF HARMING YOU.

255
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,958
I KNOW THE CLAWS AND FANGS
OF VIOLATION WELL.

256
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:29,750
YOUR DEATH WILL BE A PAINFUL ONE
IF YOU DARE TOUCH MY GOBLET.

257
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,708
- Marco: SHUT UP!
NOTHING HAS CHANGED BETWEEN US.

258
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,458
WHAT DO I CARE
ABOUT THE BALANCE?

259
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,458
I'LL SWALLOW ALL
OF THE EXISTENCES AROUND HERE,

260
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,083
AND I'LL KILL KILL KILL
YOU ALL!

261
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:43,041
- ( sighs )

262
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,791
- Lamies: DON'T GO AFTER SILVER.

263
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:46,958
- ( gasps )

264
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,500
- Marco: BASTARD, DO
YOU KNOW WHO HE IS?

265
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,375
- YOU'D BE WASTING YOUR TIME.
YOU CHASE, BUT NEVER CATCH.

266
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,750
SEARCH, BUT NEVER FIND.
HE APPEARS AT WILL.

267
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,000
- NO,
I COULD NEVER STOP LOOKING.

268
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,416
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING!

269
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,458
FINDING HIM IS THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERS TO ME!

270
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:07,708
- YOU WILL HAVE YOUR CHANCE TO
MEET HIM WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT.

271
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:11,500
HOW YOU ACCEPT IT AND WHAT YOU
DO THEN ARE FOR YOU TO DECIDE.

272
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,958
- AH.

273
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:18,000
- Alastor: CAN YOU NOT TELL US
WHO THIS "SILVER" IS?

274
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,791
VERY WELL,
I WON'T ASK AGAIN.

275
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,166
- THIS AREA HAS BEEN
QUITE SEVERELY DAMAGED.

276
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,125
I DON'T THINK EITHER OF YOU HAVE
ENOUGH POWER TO REPAIR ALL THIS.

277
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,541
- HMM.
WELL, YOU CAN USE ME.

278
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,625
- SO IT IS
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

279
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,375
BUT EVEN IF I WERE TO USE
ALL OF YOUR EXISTENCE,

280
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,166
IT STILL WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH.
- BUT THOSE ARE--

281
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:53,000
- Lamies: THANK YOU FOR YOUR
HELP, FLAME OF THE HEAVENS

282
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,583
AND FLAMING-HAIRED
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER.

283
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,750
OR RATHER, SHANA.

284
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,583
- Alastor: YOU WERE A GREAT HELP
TO US AS WELL.

285
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,583
- THANK YOU FOR RESTORING
THE CITY TO THE WAY IT WAS.

286
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,333
BUT IT COST YOU ALL THE POWER
YOU'VE BEEN GATHERING.

287
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,041
- NEVER MIND.
I CONSIDER IT A FAIR EXCHANGE

288
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,833
FOR HAVING MY FAITH
IN OTHERS RESTORED.

289
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,250
- HOW LONG?
- WHAT?

290
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,333
- IT'S JUST,
I WAS WONDERING

291
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,875
HOW LONG IT TOOK YOU
TO GATHER UP ALL THE POWER

292
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,416
THAT YOU HAD TO USE UP TODAY.

293
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,416
- FORGET THAT.
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU.

294
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,875
- HUH?

295
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,375
- I TAKE IT YOU'RE NO LONGER
JUST WAITING TO DISAPPEAR.

296
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,166
THINGS HAVE CHANGED
NOW THAT YOU HAVE

297
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,250
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD
WITHIN YOU.

298
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,958
- OH, YEAH. WELL, I'M REALLY
GLAD I'M NOT GOING TO VANISH.

299
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,916
- NOT ONLY WILL YOU
NOT VANISH, BUT YOU--

300
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,250
- HUH?

301
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:42,750
- NO, THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD
AND A FLAME HAZE.

302
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:46,166
I'M SURE THE BREEZE WILL BRING
ME WORD OF YOUR EXPLOITS.

303
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,041
UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN.

304
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,666
- Yuji: IS IT APPROPRIATE TO SAY
"TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF"?

305
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:55,375
- MMM.
FAREWELL, FLAME OF THE HEAVENS.

306
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,875
I WILL SEE YOU AGAIN
AT THE CROSSROADS OF MISFORTUNE.

307
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,916
- Alastor: I PRAY
THAT YOUR FLOWER OF HOPE

308
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,583
WILL ONE DAY BLOOM,
SPIRAL WINDHARP.

309
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,458
- HE'S WINDHARP?
THAT GUY?

310
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,125
- HUH?
WHO'S THAT?

311
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,708
- SPIRAL WINDHARP.
THE CRIMSON DENIZEN

312
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,041
WHO'S A MASTER
OF UNRESTRICTED METHODS.

313
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,083
HE DESIGNED A LOT OF THEM.
- REALLY?

314
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,625
- Alastor: CORPSE COLLECTOR
AND LAMIES ARE MERELY ALIASES.

315
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,125
HE USES SUCH NAMES
IN THIS WORLD

316
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,958
TO PROVIDE HIM WITH
THE FREEDOM HE NEEDS

317
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,000
AS HE PURSUES HIS GOALS,

318
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:29,083
GOALS SO LOFTY THEY ARE WORTH
SPENDING HUNDREDS OF YEARS

319
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,416
TO BRING ABOUT.

320
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,958
IT IS THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERS TO HIM ANYMORE.

321
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:43,500
- Margery: "RODE THE SEE-SAW,
MARGERY DAW,

322
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:47,000
SOLD HER BED

323
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,541
AND LAY ON STRAW."

324
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,083
- Alastor:
CHANTER OF ELEGIES,

325
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,375
WE ARE NOT PASSING JUDGMENT
ON YOU,

326
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,833
NOR DO WE SEEK
TO INFLUENCE YOU.

327
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,625
HOWEVER, SHOULD YOU FORGET
WHAT THE TRUE MISSION

328
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,250
OF A FLAME HAZE IS,

329
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:07,000
REST ASSURED,
WE WILL STOP YOU ONCE AGAIN.

330
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,125
- AS LONG AS WE'RE CLEAR
ABOUT THAT.

331
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,416
- DON'T CHASE, DON'T DESTROY,

332
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,833
DON'T KILL, DON'T TAKE THINGS
THAT AREN'T YOURS.

333
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,250
WHAT IS THERE LEFT
FOR ME TO DO?

334
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:20,083
HEY, MARCOSIAS, WE'RE SO
BEAT-UP, WE'RE LIKE A BAD JOKE.

335
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:24,333
( laughs )
I'M COMPLETELY EMPTY.

336
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:28,041
I'M WHAT THEY CALL A WOMAN
WITH A BAD REPUTATION.

337
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,333
- Marco: HEY!

338
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,333
- PLEASE DON'T SAY
SOMETHING CORNY LIKE,

339
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,791
"YOU'VE STILL GOT ME."
- Marco: NO, NO, LOOK BELOW.

340
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,875
- HMM? OH.

341
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:49,125
- IT'S NOT MUCH,
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE

342
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,833
WE'VE STILL GOT
A PLACE TO STAY.

343
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,458
- REMEMBER I'M STILL
NEW AT THIS,

344
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,500
SO YOU COULD GO A BIT EASIER
ON ME IN TRAINING.

345
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,541
- HEY, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO ASKED FOR LESSONS.

346
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:10,000
- YEAH, I KNOW, BUT STILL.

347
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:14,333
- SAKAI AND YUKARI--
THEY'RE TOGETHER AGAIN.

348
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:17,541
AND THEY BOTH MISSED SCHOOL
YESTERDAY.

349
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:20,000
I WONDER IF THEY'RE--

350
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:23,041
NO, IT'S JUST A COINCIDENCE.

351
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:25,916
DON'T WORRY.
I'M SURE I'M WRONG.

352
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,875
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

353
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:59,291
- Yuji: GLITTERING WATER,
BRIGHT LIGHTING--

354
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,250
A BATTLE TAKES PLACE
AT AN INDOOR WATER PARK.

355
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,500
DRESSED ONLY
IN THEIR SWIMSUITS,

356
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:06,416
THE GIRLS FACE OFF
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

357
