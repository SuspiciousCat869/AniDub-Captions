1
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,791
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,958
LIVES CONSUMED IN

3
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,833
SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.
NO ONE CAN TELL WHEN

4
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,541
THE WORLD IS DISPLACED,
AND THE FLAMES OF THE

5
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,041
CRIMSON WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

6
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,750
- ( theme song playing )

7
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:53,166
- ( singing in Japanese )

8
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,916
- ANYWAY, YOU CAN'T
GO AFTER YUJI.

9
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,125
- SURE I CAN.

10
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,625
YOU ARE BEING COMPLETELY
UNFAIR ABOUT THIS.

11
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,000
BUT I'M GONNA TELL
SAKAI THAT I LOVE HIM,

12
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,583
AND YOU'LL BE OUT
OF THE PICTURE.

13
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:31,333
- IT IS NOT UNFAIR. YOU CAN'T GO
AFTER HIM, 'CAUSE YUJI IS MY...

14
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,250
YUJI IS MY WHAT?

15
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:39,833
BELIEVE ME, IT'S BETTER FOR
YUJI TO BE WITH ME THAN YOU.

16
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:43,208
- THAT IS NOT TRUE. SAKAI SHOULD
BE THE ONE TO DECIDE THAT.

17
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,666
- BUT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT YUJI.

18
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,916
- I'LL GET TO KNOW HIM.
- YOU CAN'T.

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,416
- WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE I SAY SO.

20
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,666
- I SAID WHAT I HAD TO SAY.

21
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,666
- FORGET IT.
I WON'T LOSE TO YOU.

22
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,833
- THERE'S NO DOUBT,
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD

23
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,041
IS INSIDE THAT MYSTES.

24
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,166
- ( birds chirping )

25
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,458
- HERE, THIS ONE'S FOR YOU.

26
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:36,250
- ( sighs ) IS ANYTHING
THE MATTER, SHANA?

27
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,333
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

28
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,166
- DON'T TAKE THIS WRONG,
BUT SOMETIMES...

29
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,250
IT KINDA SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE
IRRITATED ABOUT SOMETHING.

30
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,291
- SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP.

31
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,791
YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN
THE TASTE FOR ME.

32
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,541
NO WAY, I'M NOT GOING
TO LOSE TO HER.

33
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,291
Mmm, mmm.

34
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,583
- THAT'S NOT THE WAY YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO EAT MELON BREAD.

35
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:00,833
- Hmm?

36
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,750
- LIKE THIS. FIRST YOU
BITE OFF THE CRISPY BUN.

37
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:07,291
AND THEN YOU SAVOR THE
SPONGY SOFT FILLING.

38
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:11,375
ANOTHER BITE OF THE CRISPY PART,
FOLLOWED BY MORE SPONGY FILLING.

39
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:15,708
THIS ALLOWS YOU TO BALANCE BOTH
TEXTURES EQUALLY. YOU GOT IT?

40
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,208
- UH, YEAH, SURE.
- GOOD.

41
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,375
WHAT IS THIS SPICE
THEY'VE ADDED?

42
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,666
THIS SHOP HAS NO RESPECT
FOR THE NATURAL TASTE

43
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,916
OF REAL MELON BREAD.

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,708
- ( laughs )
YOU REALLY LOVE IT, DON'T YOU?

45
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,083
- HUH?

46
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,083
- WHEN I THINK OF YOU, I ALWAYS
THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH

47
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,666
YOU LOVE MELON BREAD.

48
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,583
- LOVE?
- YEAH.

49
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,166
I DON'T KNOW A WHOLE LOT
ABOUT SHANA,

50
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,958
BUT I DO KNOW TWO THINGS
FOR CERTAIN,

51
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,416
THAT SHE'S A FLAME HAZE,

52
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,583
AND THAT SHE SURE
LOVES MELON BREAD.

53
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,166
THERE'S NO DOUBT THOSE
TWO THINGS ARE VERY

54
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,791
IMPORTANT TO WHO SHE IS.

55
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,750
AND I'M ALSO SURE THERE'S
A PRETTY GOOD REASON

56
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,333
WHY SHE LOVES
THOSE BUNS SO MUCH.

57
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,916
- ( Shana grunting )

58
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,500
- ( bell tolling )

59
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,416
- ( grunting )

60
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,416
- Wirhelmina: AND THAT ABOUT
SUMS IT UP, FLAME OF HEAVEN.

61
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,208
- Alastor: WELL, WHAT
DO YOU THINK?

62
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,041
- SHE IS MOST SUITABLE INDEED.

63
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:50,208
SHE EXCELS AT BOTH HER STUDIES
AND THE MARTIAL ARTS.

64
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,208
SHE QUICKLY APPLIES WHAT SHE
LEARNS, KNOWS HER LIMITATIONS,

65
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,666
AND HAS A MERCILESS WORK ETHIC.

66
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,750
- ( grunts )

67
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,333
- INDEED IT'S RARE TO FIND SUCH
SELF-RESPECT

68
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,750
COMBINED WITH A NATURAL
ABILITY TO FIGHT.

69
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,583
IT'S POINTLESS TO EVEN COMPARE
HER TO THE OTHERS WE'VE SEEN.

70
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:11,333
SHE IS INDEED AN INDIVIDUAL
OF EXCEPTIONAL TALENT.

71
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,250
- Alastor: UNEXPECTED RESULTS
FROM A GIRL

72
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,208
WE ENCOUNTERED
BY HAPPENSTANCE.

73
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,250
- Wirhelmina: THE UNFORTUNATE
INCIDENTS WERE A COINCIDENCE,

74
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,833
AS WAS MY APPEARANCE
ON THE SCENE.

75
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:26,083
LIKEWISE MY BRINGING HER HERE,
TO THE PALACE OF HEAVEN'S ROAD.

76
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:30,458
- Alastor: HMM, WHAT IS IT?
YOU SEEM UNEASY ABOUT SOMETHING.

77
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:39,041
- Wirhelmina: YOU MUST BE
AWARE OF THIS, INDEED AS I AM,

78
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,958
BUT I GET THE FEELING
SHE HAS ANOTHER SIDE,

79
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,791
A SIDE SHE'S NOT SHOWING US.

80
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:48,416
I FEEL INDEED SHE IS KEEPING
A SECRET TO HERSELF,

81
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,541
ONE THAT SHE HAS DECIDED
NOT TO REVEAL TO US.

82
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,250
SOMETHING IN THE DARKEST
CORNERS OF HER HEART,

83
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,083
A MYSTERY THAT NO ONE
MUST KNOW ABOUT.

84
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:00,000
- Alastor: YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT YOU
COULD SAY THE SAME THING

85
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,750
FOR EVERY ONE OF US.

86
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:02,833
- YES.

87
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,333
- ( screams )

88
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,875
- ( clicking )

89
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,333
- Wirhelmina: INDEED ALL THIS
TIME AND YOU STILL HAVEN'T

90
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,791
LANDED A BLOW ON SHIRO.

91
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,000
- HELLO, WIRHELMINA.

92
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,541
- I GUESS YOU'RE BACK
FROM SHOPPING.

93
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,958
- YES.

94
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,333
- OH, DID YOU BRING
ME A TREAT AGAIN?

95
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:40,791
- ( chuckles )

96
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,083
- AW...

97
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,458
- INDEED YOUR FAULT, NOT HIS,
THAT IT WAS RUINED.

98
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,541
- I CAN'T FIGHT IN
THIS STUPID OUTFIT.

99
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,791
THE SKIRT IS TOO LONG, IT KEEPS
GETTING IN MY WAY WHEN I KICK.

100
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,000
I CAN'T KEEP UP WITH SHIRO
WEARING THIS.

101
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,958
- IN THE WORLD THAT LIES OUTSIDE
THE PALACE OF HEAVEN'S ROAD,

102
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,958
THAT IS THE ATTIRE OF MANY
WARRIORS

103
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:10,041
OF OUTSTANDING
ABILITY AND SKILL.

104
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,541
- YEAH, BUT...

105
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,458
- INDEED I HAVE PERSONALLY
WITNESSED MANY INDIVIDUALS

106
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,333
MOVING AND FIGHTING
AT TOP SPEED

107
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,791
IN JUST SUCH AN OUTFIT,

108
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,958
THOUGH THEY HAVE FEWER
PROBLEMS THAN YOU DO.

109
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,000
- ( grunts )

110
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,291
- ( groans )

111
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,583
- YOU'RE NOT BEING
FAIR, WIRHELMINA.

112
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:33,041
- FAIR HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH IT. I'M HERE TO JUDGE YOU.

113
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,291
- CRIMSON DENIZENS
THAT EAT PEOPLE?

114
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,625
AND THE FLAME HAZES
WHO BATTLE THEM?

115
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,541
IS THE OUTSIDE WORLD
REALLY LIKE THAT?

116
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,500
- ( bell tolling )

117
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,583
- ( clicks )

118
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,916
- THIS TIME FOR SURE.

119
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,375
- I TOLD YOU, I'M OKAY.

120
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,458
- SO WHERE DOES IT
HURT THE MOST?

121
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,791
- MY RIBS, ON THE RIGHT.

122
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,625
- DO YOU NEED TREATMENT?
- NO THANKS.

123
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,750
- OW!

124
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,958
- THAT LOOKS FAIRLY
PAINFUL TO ME.

125
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,125
- ANYONE WOULD JUMP
IN THE AIR IF YOU POKED THEM

126
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,666
IN THE SIDE LIKE THAT.

127
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,708
- THAT BEHAVIOR IS
QUITE RUDE INDEED.

128
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,208
- GOOD NIGHT.

129
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:34,958
- GOOD NIGHT AND REST EASY.

130
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,333
THERE IS PLENTY OF TIME
BEFORE IT HAPPENS.

131
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,541
- I CAN'T SLEEP, ALASTOR.

132
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,875
COULD YOU TELL ME
MY FAVORITE STORY AGAIN?

133
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,458
THE FLAME-HAIRED
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER.

134
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,291
- ( humming )

135
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,958
- ARE YOU GOING SHOPPING TODAY?

136
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,833
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
I'LL BE BACK THIS EVENING.

137
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,833
YOUR LUNCH IS IN
THE MICROWAVE, INDEED.

138
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,375
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

139
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,666
- Hmm.

140
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,750
- THE ONLY THING LEFT
TO PICK UP...

141
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,583
IS INDEED ONE OF
THOSE BUNS SHE LIKES.

142
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,916
- Tiamat: UNRESTRICTED METHOD.
- ANALYSIS CONFIRMED.

143
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,125
BUT I'M ONLY PICKING UP
AN EXTREMELY WEAK ENTITY NEARBY.

144
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,625
- BE ALERT.
- ACKNOWLEDGED.

145
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,125
I'VE BEEN EXTRA CAUTIOUS
LATELY INDEED.

146
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,083
- ( people murmuring )

147
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,750
- I CONCLUDE THAT NOTHING HAS
CHANGED AND IT'S SAFE

148
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,750
TO MAKE THE ASSUMPTION
THAT OUR LOCATION

149
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,500
IS STILL UNKNOWN TO THOSE
WHO MIGHT BE HUNTING US.

150
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:37,375
- CARELESSNESS IS YOUR ENEMY.
- I UNDERSTAND.

151
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,208
HOWEVER, THE PALACE OF
HEAVEN'S ROAD IS UNDETECTABLE.

152
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,500
INDEED, NOT EVEN A MASTER OF
UNRESTRICTED METHODS

153
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,666
COULD FIND IT.

154
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,916
- ( Vine laughing )

155
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,875
PUTTING A NET HERE
WASN'T A BAD IDEA.

156
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,500
PALACE OF HEAVEN'S ROAD,
HERE I COME.

157
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,375
YOU! THOUSAND ORDINANCES.

158
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,458
- I NEVER EXPECTED TO SEE YOU
IN ASIA, THOUSAND ORDINANCES.

159
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,750
- IT'S NOT THAT UNUSUAL,

160
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:29,125
CONSIDERING I'VE BEEN SENT HERE
BY A LEADER OF THE BALL MASQUE,

161
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,500
BEL PEOL TO BE SPECIFIC.

162
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,875
- IS THERE AN
OPERATION UNDERWAY?

163
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,958
- EVEN SOMEONE LIKE YOU MUST
KNOW OF OUR MANY BROTHERS

164
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,833
WHO HAVE FALLEN AS OF LATE,
ONE AFTER THE OTHER.

165
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:44,250
- YES, THERE'S A POWERFUL
FLAME HAZE SOMEWHERE OUT THERE.

166
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,416
- MANY OF OUR FALLEN BROTHERS
WERE VERY SKILLFUL,

167
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,833
WHICH MEANS OUR ENEMY IS TRULY
A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH.

168
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,333
ANY INFORMATION?

169
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,666
- I'M SO CLOSE TO FINDING THE
PALACE OF HEAVEN'S ROAD.

170
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,791
I'M NOT GOING TO LET
HIM CLAIM THE GLORY

171
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,708
AFTER ALL MY HARD WORK.

172
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,958
- YOU WORM, YOU KNOW SOMETHING.

173
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:06,041
- UH, YES. AN ENEMY,
JUST A MOMENT AGO.

174
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,291
- OH? AND WHAT KIND
OF ENEMY DID YOU FIND?

175
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,041
- THERE'S NO DOUBT. I FOUND
A FLAME HAZE DOWN THERE.

176
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,083
WE COULD GET INFORMATION ON
YOUR QUARRY BY INTERROGATING IT.

177
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:19,291
- VERY WELL. HOWEVER POWERFUL
THIS ENEMY MIGHT BE,

178
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,708
I WILL TRACK IT DOWN
AND CRUSH IT.

179
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,083
- EXCELLENT. I AM TRULY
GRATEFUL FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE.

180
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,916
I JUST HOPE HE DOESN'T KILL
THE FLAME HAZE

181
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,291
BEFORE IT CAN LEAD
ME TO THE PALACE.

182
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,083
- ( microwave bell dings )

183
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,250
- HOW CAN I BEAT SHIRO? HMM.

184
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,666
- ( screams )

185
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,041
- HUH?

186
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,208
- ( chuckles ) THAT'S IT.

187
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,333
THAT'S THE LAST.

188
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,333
SHIRO TAUGHT ME THAT ONE OF
THE BASIC RULES

189
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:35,375
IS TO CATCH YOUR
OPPONENT OFF GUARD.

190
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:45,375
IS TO CATCH YOUR
OPPONENT OFF GUARD.

191
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:51,916
IS TO CATCH YOUR
OPPONENT OFF GUARD.

192
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
- ( engine revving )

193
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,583
- Bel Peol: BIND THE
DRIFTING EYE. HELP ME.

194
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,750
AVENGE THE LOSS
OF YOUR BROTHERS.

195
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:14,041
THE TOOLS OF DESTRUCTION, THE
PATHETIC FLAME HAZES MUST PAY.

196
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:17,291
SLAUGHTER THEM.
SLAUGHTER THEM ALL.

197
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:24,875
- LADY BEL PEOL, YOUR PATIENCE
IS ABOUT TO BE REWARDED.

198
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,458
I AM ON THE VERGE
OF ACCOMPLISHING

199
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,500
SOMETHING MAGNIFICENT.

200
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,250
A TRULY MOMENTOUS
EVENT IS AT HAND.

201
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,125
- Wirhelmina: WHICH ONE? OH.

202
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,583
Mmm...

203
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,916
MAYBE...
OH, NO.

204
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,791
INDEED I SHOULDN'T SPOIL HER,

205
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,625
BUT SHE'S... NO.

206
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,166
OH, MAYBE JUST ONE.

207
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,750
- Tiamat: INCOMING.
- ROGER THAT. CONFIRMED.

208
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,708
- LEAVE NOW.
- ABANDONING BAGGAGE.

209
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,916
PREPARE FOR IMMEDIATE
EXIT OF AREA.

210
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,916
- Orgon: I DON'T BELIEVE
WE'VE EVER MET, FLAME HAZE.

211
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,625
- ORGON,
THE THOUSAND ORDINANCES.

212
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,458
- Tiamat: CORRECT.

213
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:39,625
- WHAT'S WRONG? WHY AREN'T YOU
CHANGING TO PREPARE FOR BATTLE?

214
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,500
COULD IT BE YOU'RE A NOVICE?

215
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:45,125
NEWLY CONTRACTED
AND UNSURE OF YOUR POWERS?

216
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,541
HMM, THAT'S WHAT
I GET FOR LISTENING

217
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,000
TO A LIGHTWEIGHT LIKE VINE.

218
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:54,416
WELL, NOW THAT I'M HERE, I'LL
FIND OUT WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF.

219
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,541
FIRST, HAVE A TASTE OF HOGIER.

220
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,541
NEXT, BEHOLD THE POWER
OF LA HIRE.

221
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:19,125
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO REVEAL
YOUR TRUE APPEARANCE,

222
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,916
THEN THERE'S NO NEED
FOR ME TO EMPLOY

223
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,583
THE REMAINDER OF MY FOUR CARDS.

224
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:28,291
- AH YES, THAT'S THOUSAND
ORDINANCE'S POWER, LEGION.

225
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,416
- ( bell tolling )

226
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:00,791
- I GOT HIM.

227
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,166
UH, OKAY, I BET
THAT WAS A SURPRISE.

228
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,416
- ( screams in pain )

229
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,666
- ( screaming )

230
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,458
- ( screeches )

231
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,750
- HUH?

232
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,750
- WHAT? WHAT IS THAT?

233
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,208
- ( gasps )

234
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:45,083
I, I FOUND IT.
THE PALACE OF HEAVEN'S ROAD.

235
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,166
- WE HAVE A REAL
EMERGENCY INDEED.

236
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:56,041
- THIS IS FANTASTIC. THE WORLD
HAS STARTED TO TURN IN MY FAVOR.

237
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,041
- MIGHTY WARRIOR,

238
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,583
I AM HERE TO FIGHT YOU.

239
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,333
- ( theme song playing )

240
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,541
- ( singing in Japanese )

241
00:24:56,791 --> 00:25:00,166
- Yuji: THE CRIMSON DENIZENS
ATTACK, JOINED BY TENMOKUIKKO,

242
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,791
THE MOST POWERFUL MYSTES OF ALL.
AS THE PALACE SHAKES,

243
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:06,000
A YOUNG GIRL BECOMES
A FLAME HAZE.

244
