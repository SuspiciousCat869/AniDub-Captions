1
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,833
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,583
LIVES CONSUMED IN

3
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,833
SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.
NO ONE CAN TELL WHEN

4
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,500
THE WORLD IS DISPLACED,
AND THE FLAMES OF THE

5
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:45,250
CRIMSON WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

6
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:49,208
- ( theme song playing )

7
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:53,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

8
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,166
( grunting )

9
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,333
- WHAT'S THIS?

10
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,291
- THAT'S AWESOME, TIRIEL!
WE CAUGHT HER!

11
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,958
- YES, OF COURSE WE DID,
DEAR BROTHER.

12
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,791
AFTER ALL, FLAME HAZES IN
GENERAL AREN'T VERY SMART.

13
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,625
SHE SAW THE ENORMOUS FLOWER

14
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,083
AND IMMEDIATELY JUMPED TO
THE WRONG CONCLUSION

15
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,958
THAT THE PLANT
WAS OUR WEAK SPOT.

16
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:48,000
THIS IS A RINNE, CALLED PINION.
DESTROY ITS FLOWERS,

17
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,750
AND NEW ONES GROW
ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY.

18
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,125
- ( grunts )

19
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,833
- I CAN'T WAIT, TIRIEL!
THAT'S THE NIETONO NO SHANA!

20
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,166
OH, CAN I HAVE IT NOW? PLEASE?

21
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,458
- OH, YES DEAR BROTHER.
YOU CAN HAVE IT.

22
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,583
- I THINK IT'S TIME YOU
HANDED OVER YOUR SWORD.

23
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,208
- NEVER!

24
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,208
- ( screams )

25
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,791
- THE NIETONO NO SHANA!

26
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,583
- HUH?

27
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,500
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WANDERING AROUND OUT HERE?

28
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,458
- Yuji: IT'S YOU.

29
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,875
- INCREDIBLE. I DIDN'T BELIEVE
IT WHEN I SAW SOMEONE MOVING.

30
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,541
THEN I REALIZED IT HAD TO
BE YOU ROAMING THE STREETS.

31
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,250
- YES. SEE,
I'M TRYING TO...

32
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,041
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- BE QUIET.

33
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,750
- WHAT IS THAT THING?
- IT'S A TYPE OF RINNE.

34
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,583
I THINK WE SHOULD
GET OUTTA HERE.

35
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,750
- ( panting )

36
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:18,625
CAN YOU HEAR ME? IT'S EXACTLY
WHO I THOUGHT IT'S GOING TO BE.

37
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,291
- Tanaka: YOU MEAN IT
WAS THE OTHER

38
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,208
FLAME HAZE'S ATTENDANT
OUT THERE?

39
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,208
THAT'S THE ONE CALLED
A MYSTES, RIGHT?

40
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,125
- Margery: THAT'S RIGHT.

41
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,041
I DON'T KNOW IF
HE FEELS OBLIGATED TO HER

42
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,083
OR IF HE'S IN LOVE
WITH THE LITTLE BRAT.

43
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,125
WHAT HE'S DOING IS RECKLESS.

44
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,416
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

45
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,458
- Margery: YOU GUYS SEE
ANYTHING ELSE UNUSUAL?

46
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,916
- Yuji: UM, WHO ARE
YOU TALKING TO?

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,250
- Margery: I'M TALKING
TO MY HENCHMEN.

48
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,125
HEY, WAKE UP!
ANYTHING ELSE MOVING?

49
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:47,125
- Tanaka: BIG SISTER? DID YOU
JUST CALL US YOUR HENCHMEN?

50
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,541
- Margery: WHAT?

51
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,833
- Tanaka: I MEAN, THAT'S
WHAT IT SOUNDED LIKE.

52
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,833
WE JUST WANNA SAY WE'RE HONORED
THAT YOU SEE US THAT WAY.

53
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,708
- OH, WHAT A COUPLE OF...

54
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,291
COME ON! IS ANYTHING
MOVING OUT HERE?

55
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,416
- ( Marco laughs )

56
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,583
- Marco: I THINK YOU'RE
BLUSHING, MY NAIVE LITTLE...

57
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:06,083
- Yuji: THAT'S NOT HOW
ALASTOR'S TREATED.

58
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,916
SHE'S DIFFERENT.

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,916
- Tanaka: UM, THAT
BIG FLOWER FROM BEFORE

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,458
LOOKS LIKE ITS SET THINGS UP

61
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,291
SO ALL THE AREAS
ACT LIKE PIPELINES.

62
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,833
- Sato: NOTHING ELSE
HAS CHANGED.

63
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,166
THE UNRESTRICTED METHOD STILL
HAS EVERYTHING WRAPPED UP

64
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,958
AND THE TORCHES HAVEN'T MOVED.

65
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:23,750
- HMM... COME TO THINK OF
IT, I FORGOT TO ASK

66
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,916
WHAT YOU WERE DOING OUT
HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,875
- WELL, IT'S NO MYSTERY. SHANA
SAID THERE MIGHT BE A DEVICE

68
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:32,083
GATHERING POWER OF EXISTENCE,
SO I WAS LOOKING FOR IT.

69
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,000
- Marco: HEY, HEY,
WAIT A MINUTE.

70
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,666
ARE YOU SAYING YOU DETECTED
SOME KIND OF OBJECT

71
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,666
AND YOU WERE TRACKING IT
BEFORE THE FLOWER BLOOMED?

72
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,833
- UH, YES, SORT OF.

73
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,250
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW,

74
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,416
BECAUSE I'D NEVER BE ABLE
TO GET PAST THAT THING

75
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,000
TO DESTROY THE DEVICE.

76
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,625
- Margery: I GUESS THERE IS
SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT YOU.

77
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,958
YOU KEPT YOUR HEAD AND
FOUND OUT WHERE THE RINNE WAS

78
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,666
IN ALL THIS CONFUSION.

79
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,375
- OH, YEAH? YOU THINK SO?

80
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,708
- WITH YOUR HELP, WE MAY BE ABLE
TO MAKE THIS INTERESTING.

81
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:03,541
IT WOULD MEAN TEAMING UP WITH
THE LITTLE BRAT. YOU IN?

82
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:13,333
- I GOT IT!
MY NIETONO NO SHANA!

83
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,333
- THAT'S SIMPLY
WONDERFUL, DEAR BROTHER.

84
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,166
IT'S TIME, DEAR BROTHER.

85
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,000
- RIGHT, HERE'S YOUR REWARD.

86
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,958
- HEY SHANA,
IF I END UP HELPING YOU,

87
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,041
HOW 'BOUT YOU GIVE
ME A LITTLE REWARD?

88
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,958
- Chigusa: SHANA-CHAN, THIS IS
HOW I FEEL ABOUT A KISS,

89
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:44,041
IF IT'S ON THE LIPS,
THEN IT'S LIKE A PERSONAL OATH.

90
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,416
- Shana: NO, IT'S DIFFERENT
WITH THESE TWO.

91
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,833
- I HAVE AN IDEA, WHY DON'T YOU
TEST IT ON HER, DEAR BROTHER.

92
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,208
- TEST IT OUT?

93
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,333
AW, YEAH, FOR SURE!

94
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,083
- ( gasps )

95
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,333
THIS IS GREAT, TIRIEL!

96
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:22,125
THE BLADE DOESN'T EVEN
CHIP WHEN I CUT THE CHAIN!

97
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,625
- MY BROTHER LOVES TO
TEST HIS NEW TOYS

98
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,416
ON ANY UNLUCKY FLAME
HAZES WE RUN ACROSS.

99
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,166
CLOTHES COME FIRST,
THEN SKIN AND FLESH AND BONES,

100
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,541
THEN EACH INTERNAL ORGAN.

101
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,750
WELL, THIS ISN'T ANY FUN.

102
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,083
SHE'S FINISHED, BUT SHE HASN'T
MADE ANY DESPERATE THREATS

103
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,875
OR EVEN BROKEN
DOWN IN TEARS YET.

104
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,875
- YOU KISS,
BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME.

105
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,208
IT'S NOT AN OATH FOR YOU TWO.

106
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:59,291
- AN OATH?
YES, THAT'S ONE WAY TO PUT IT.

107
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:03,875
I GIVE MY BROTHER UNCONDITIONAL
JOY, WHICH IN TURN SATISFIES ME.

108
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,875
TOGETHER, WE SING THE PRAISES OF
THE EMOTION CALLED LOVE.

109
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:11,041
YOU ARE A TOOL OF DESTRUCTION,
THE PUPPET OF SOME LORD.

110
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,500
AND I PERSONALLY DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU THINK OF US.

111
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,250
- NO, YOU'RE DIFFERENT.

112
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:18,000
IT'S NOT LOVE. IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE JUST

113
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,916
HANGING ONTO EACH OTHER.

114
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,583
- Tiriel: PERHAPS
THE CONVERSATION

115
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,666
WAS A LITTLE TOO ADVANCED
FOR A MERE CHILD.

116
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,625
IT WAS POINTLESS TALKING TO
SOMEONE LIKE YOU ABOUT LOVE.

117
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,375
YOU'RE A TOOL FOR DESTRUCTION.

118
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,541
I WILL FULFILL ALL OF
MY BROTHER'S DESIRES.

119
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,791
I WILL PROTECT HIM!

120
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,416
I DO EVERYTHING FOR HIM!

121
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,416
- YUJI AND I AREN'T LIKE THEM.
IT'S DIFFERENT.

122
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,250
- ( explosion )

123
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,458
- WHAT WAS THAT?

124
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,833
- MADNESS,
GET THEE TO A NUNNERY.

125
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,833
- Marco: OH, BOY, JUST BECAUSE
YOU CAN'T REMEMBER

126
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:05,958
ANY OF YOUR SONGS,

127
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,708
DO YOU HAVE TO USE
SOMETHING SO CRUDE?

128
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,416
- BUT WE GET
THE SAME EFFECT.

129
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,375
THAT'S NUMBER 5. ON TO THE NEXT.

130
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,375
- THE NEXT ONE IS
THAT MAN STANDING

131
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,916
IN FRONT OF THE GAS STATION.

132
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
- I HEAR YA. IT WON'T BE LONG.
THEY'RE GONNA SENSE THIS.

133
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,083
- SOMEHOW THEY'RE FINDING ALL OF
THE PINIONS AND DESTROYING THEM.

134
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:43,666
IT'S THAT FLAME HAZE.
HOW IS SHE DOING IT?

135
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,375
SYDONAY, ARE YOU THERE?

136
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,500
- Sydonay: YEAH.

137
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,541
- Tiriel: THAT OTHER FLAME HAZE
IS ON THE MOVE.

138
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,625
- WE SHOULD
LEAVE HER ALONE.

139
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,166
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,

140
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,625
MY ORDERS WERE TO JUST
PROTECT THE ORGEL.

141
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,833
- ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
- Tiriel: THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

142
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,000
IF SHE KEEPS THIS UP, THE SPELL
OF THE CRADLE GARDEN

143
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,083
WILL BE BROKEN.

144
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,208
NOW HURRY!

145
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:08,500
- I SEE NO PROBLEM IN
LEAVING THINGS AS THEY ARE.

146
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,000
YOU GOT THE SWORD YOU
WERE AFTER, DIDN'T YOU?

147
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,666
- Tiriel: LISTEN,
WE CAN'T LET SOMEONE

148
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,125
GET AWAY WHO CAN SEE THROUGH
THE PINION'S CAMOUFLAGE.

149
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,916
- Sydonay: ALL RIGHT. IT IS
MY JOB TO PROTECT YOU

150
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,375
FROM THE FLAME HAZES.

151
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,833
- HMM...

152
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,500
OH, DEAR BROTHER, I'M AFRAID
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

153
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,375
LET'S BURN HER
WITH A SINGLE THRUST.

154
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,000
- THAT'S A GREAT IDEA!
IT IS A FLAMING SWORD.

155
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,541
- BURNED ALIVE.

156
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:52,291
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO KNOW YOU'LL
DIE BY YOUR OWN SWORD?

157
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:56,666
- YUJI WILL TAKE CARE
OF THINGS. HE CAN DO IT.

158
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,208
- GOODBYE, TOOL FOR DESTRUCTION.
YOU'RE ALL ALONE,

159
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,291
AND YOU'LL LEAVE THIS WORLD
IN A BURST OF FIRE.

160
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,125
- I'M NOT ALONE!
I'M NOT A TOOL!

161
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,083
THERE ARE TWO OF US,
BUT WE CAN BE APART.

162
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,000
WE CAN FEEL EACH OTHER
AND GIVE EACH OTHER STRENGTH.

163
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,916
I AM A FLAME HAZE.

164
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,916
I HAVE MADE A VOW,
AND I AM DETERMINED TO KEEP

165
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,458
THE BALANCE OF THE WORLD.

166
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,333
THAT IS MY MISSION.

167
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,291
- STRIKE HER NOW!
- SWORD OF FIRE!

168
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,583
- IT'S DONE LIKE THIS!

169
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,083
- ( gasps )

170
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,500
- ( screaming )

171
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,791
- THAT'S BLOOD SUCKER!

172
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,250
- ( screaming )

173
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,750
- DEAR BROTHER!

174
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,458
- Shana: HERE, CATCH!

175
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,000
- ( gasps )

176
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,708
- Sydonay: I'M PLEASED THAT YOU
FOUND THE COURAGE

177
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,791
TO STEP FORWARD
AND MAKE YOUR PRESENCE KNOWN,

178
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,250
BEAUTIFUL SLAUGHTERER.

179
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,833
- HOW ABOUT YOU GIVE
THE NONSENSE A REST,

180
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,333
AND SHOW US WHAT YOU
REALLY LOOK LIKE.

181
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,791
- FAIR ENOUGH.

182
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,833
EXCHANGING PLEASANTRIES AS
BEASTS MIGHT BE WHAT I NEED.

183
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,458
- ( growling )

184
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:43,541
- Marco: THOUSAND CHANGES! YOU
COULDN'T PICK JUST ONE ANIMAL?

185
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,250
- Sydonay:
COME, TAKE A CLOSER LOOK,

186
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,458
FANGS AND CLAWS OF VIOLATION.

187
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,750
IT'LL BE THE LAST THING
YOU'LL EVER SEE!

188
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,083
- WHERE IS IT?
IT'S SOMEWHERE NEAR.

189
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,791
I THINK UP THERE.

190
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,375
- Sydonay: IT'S TOO BAD,
CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

191
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:10,875
YOU'VE BECOME SOFT.
HOW DISAPPOINTING.

192
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,875
- HE'S RIGHT,
I CAN'T FIGHT BACK.

193
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,875
AND I DON'T EVEN FEEL
THAT BAD ABOUT IT.

194
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,375
- Sydonay: LET US END THIS.

195
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:28,541
HOPE YOU AT LEAST HAVE FUN
IN HELL, MARGERY DAW.

196
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,583
- Shana: WHAT'S THIS?

197
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,375
SOMEHOW THEY'VE
HEALED THEIR INJURIES,

198
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,625
AND THEY'VE EVEN
PUT OUT THE FLAMES.

199
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,083
- GIVE IT.
MY NIETONO NO SHANA.

200
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,291
- YOU'D BETTER
HAND IT OVER.

201
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,666
- YOU'RE FADING.

202
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,208
- IT'S TRUE, YOU SEE, THERE WAS
ENOUGH POWER OF EXISTENCE

203
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,875
TO HEAL MY BROTHER'S INJURIES
AND STOP YOUR ATTACK,

204
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,916
BUT THAT USED UP THE LAST OF IT.

205
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,125
- THEREFORE...
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

206
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,916
- I TOLD YOU WHY.

207
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,583
I AM HERE TO FULFILL
THE DESIRES OF MY BROTHER

208
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,458
AND TO PROTECT HIM.

209
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:20,083
- BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIM?
- THAT'S RIGHT, I DO.

210
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,666
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TASTE THIS
UNBEARABLE FEELING AS WELL?

211
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:29,666
RIGHT NOW, THERE'S A YOUNG MAN
ON THAT BRIDGE WHO'S MOVING.

212
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,541
- ( grunting )

213
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,625
- I JUST CAN'T DO IT.
IT'S TOO FAR.

214
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,666
- ( gasps )

215
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,708
- Sydonay: YOU THERE,
WHY ARE YOU MOVING?

216
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:48,958
ARE YOU A MYSTES?

217
00:14:56,625 --> 00:15:00,041
- HE REALLY DID A NUMBER ON US.
- Marco: YEAH,

218
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,291
BUT YOU DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB
IN THE MAGIC TRICKS DEPARTMENT.

219
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,041
YOU TOSSED OUT A DUMMY JUST
BEFORE THIS PLACE COLLAPSED

220
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,791
AND THEN STAYED CALM
SO WE WOULDN'T BE NOTICED.

221
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,500
HE'S UNDER THE ASSUMPTION
WE WERE KILLED.

222
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,125
- CONSIDERING I CAN'T
CHANT SONGS ANYMORE,

223
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,833
THAT WAS THE BEST I COULD DO.

224
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,875
IN ANY CASE, WE SHOULD FIND OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON OUTSIDE.

225
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,916
KEISAKU, EITA.

226
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:26,375
HEY, KEISAKU, EITA,
COME ON, ANSWER ME!

227
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,166
WHAT'S GOING ON?

228
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,333
- Marco: I LOST CONTACT
WITH THEM A WHILE AGO.

229
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,708
- WHAT?

230
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,833
- Marco: I DIDN'T HEAR
A SINGLE WORD FROM

231
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:38,291
ALL THE TIME YOU WERE
UNCONSCIOUS. NOT A SOUND.

232
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,208
- WAIT JUST A MINUTE HERE!

233
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,500
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
YOU DON'T...

234
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,125
MARCOSIAS!

235
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,208
- Marco: BUT, IT'S WHAT
YOU WANTED, ISN'T IT?

236
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:52,208
OH, MY LAZY FOOL, MARGERY DAW.

237
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,750
STAYING INDOORS FOR DAYS ON END.

238
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,041
MAKING EXCUSES ABOUT HOW YOU'VE
BECOME NOTHING

239
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,666
BUT AN EMPTY SHELL.

240
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,250
AND NOW LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED.

241
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:05,000
WHAT RIGHT DO YOU HAVE TO
COMPLAIN? AND WHO WOULD CARE?

242
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,791
- BUT I... BUT I...

243
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:11,083
HOW MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS
HAVE I BEEN FIGHTING?

244
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:14,208
ALWAYS CHASING SILVER,
PURSUING HIM.

245
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,958
YOU COULD CUT ME A LITTLE SLACK.

246
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,708
- Marco: IF THAT WAS ALLOWED,
THEN WE'D ALL BE SITTING PRETTY,

247
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:22,208
BUT IT ISN'T. YOU'VE GOTTA
PULL YOUR OWN WEIGHT.

248
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,375
THAT'S THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS.

249
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:30,333
- Margery: ONCE MORE, I STAND ON
MY FEET. I RISE FROM THE DEPTHS,

250
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,958
AND I START AGAIN.

251
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,791
- ( Marco whooping )

252
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,833
- ( growling )

253
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,708
- YOU GUYS!

254
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,833
MARCO! WHAT IS THIS?

255
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,333
- ( laughing )

256
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,583
- Marco: TECHNICALLY
I WASN'T LYING.

257
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,208
I TOLD THEM YOU
WERE DOWN THERE,

258
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,625
BUT I NEVER
RECEIVED AN ANSWER.

259
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,375
- YOU... HOW DARE YOU?

260
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,333
- I'M SO GLAD YOU MADE IT!

261
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,500
- Marco: WATCH OUT, EITA.

262
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,458
IT'S DANGEROUS TO GET
TOO CLOSE TO HER.

263
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,333
YOUR BIG SISTER DOESN'T
LIKE TO LOSE,

264
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,833
AND SHE'S ANGRY RIGHT NOW.

265
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,041
THAT MEANS SHE'S SERIOUS.

266
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,583
- BUT SHE'S BEEN INJURED.

267
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,541
- Marco: DON'T WORRY,
SHE'S USED TO FAR WORSE.

268
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,666
NOW, HURRY BACK
TO THE CRYSTAL ALTAR.

269
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,666
- OKAY THEN,
WE'LL HEAD RIGHT OVER THERE.

270
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,500
- BLAST HIM! SHOW THAT
DENIZEN WHO'S BOSS, BIG SISTER!

271
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,250
- WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?

272
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,166
I LOOK LIKE A COMPLETE IDIOT
BACK THERE, YOU KNOW.

273
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,875
- Marco: YOU WANNA QUIT?

274
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,916
- YOU'VE GOTTA BE
KIDDING. QUIT NOW?

275
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,583
I HAVE SOMETHING
I WANNA PROTECT.

276
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,083
- ( screaming )

277
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,458
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
HIDING INSIDE YOU,

278
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,208
BUT I'M TAKING IT.

279
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,916
- SHANA.

280
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,166
- ARE YOU CARRYING...

281
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,458
THAT'S WHY. I UNDERSTAND.

282
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,500
- WELL, IT'S MINE NOW.
- SMASH HIM!

283
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,666
- CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

284
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,291
- NICE TIMING, EH, KID?

285
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:24,708
- Marco: TIME TO ROLL UP THE
SLEEVES, WE'RE HERE TO FIGHT!

286
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:29,041
- PENNIES, PENNIES, PENNIES IN
A SACK BRINGS A MILLION BACK.

287
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,666
WELL, WELL, WELL.

288
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,333
I GUESS I DON'T NEED TO BE
FULL OF HATE TO FIGHT.

289
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,000
- Marco: LOOKS THAT WAY!

290
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,791
- SHANA!
- YUJI!

291
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,958
- Yuji: THAT'S IT.

292
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,541
- Shana: NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

293
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,500
THAT'S THE TREASURE RUNNING
THEIR UNRESTRICTED METHOD.

294
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,833
- Tiriel: YES.

295
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:26,541
THE CRADLE GARDEN IS MAINTAINED
AND CONTROLLED BY THE ORGEL.

296
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,333
NO MATTER HOW COMPLICATED
THE UNRESTRICTED METHOD IS,

297
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,291
THE ORGEL WILL PLAY
THE SAME TUNE OVER AND OVER.

298
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,041
- HER BODY. IT'S FADING.

299
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:38,333
- MY NIETONO NO SHANA. GIVE IT!

300
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,666
- Margery: RING AROUND
THE ROSEY.

301
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,875
- Marco: A POCKET FULL
OF POSIES.

302
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:58,166
- DAMN IT, IF THIS KEEPS UP,
I WON'T BE ABLE TO HELP THEM.

303
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,250
ARE THE SIBLINGS
STILL IN THE GAME?

304
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,166
CRIMSON WINGS?
IT'S FLAMING-HAIR BLAZING-EYES.

305
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,666
- Margery: HEADS UP!

306
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:15,458
- THE ENGULFED IN LOVE SIBLINGS
ARE FINISHED. IT'S TIME I LEFT.

307
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,375
- THOUSAND CHANGES
IS RUNNING AWAY.

308
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,958
- ( gasps )

309
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,958
- MY PRECIOUS BROTHER!

310
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:43,333
ANYTHING YOU WANT,
I WILL MAKE HAPPEN.

311
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,500
- HUH?

312
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,625
NIETONO!

313
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:05,916
- SORRY.

314
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,916
- I SEE I'M NOT THE
ONLY ONE WHO'S FINISHED.

315
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,625
THOSE DEGENERATES
AND THEIR UNRESTRICTED METHOD.

316
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:26,333
I MADE A FEW CHANGES
HERE AND THERE.

317
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:30,083
IT'S CRAZY HOW MUCH POWER
OF EXISTENCE THEY'D GATHERED.

318
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,791
WE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO PUT THE CITY

319
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,541
BACK TOGETHER
WITH NO REAL PROBLEM.

320
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,083
- Shana: HURRY UP, THE SEAL'S
COMING DOWN SOON.

321
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,250
- Yuji: I KNOW.
WE NEED TO GET BACK.

322
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,375
SO WHERE WERE YOU, SHANA?

323
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,291
- WELL, I WAS...

324
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,166
SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

325
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,625
NOWHERE.

326
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:57,125
- ALL RIGHT THEN. SEE YA.

327
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,875
- NO, YUJI, WAIT.

328
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,708
DURING THIS BATTLE,
YOU DID A GREAT JOB

329
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,083
TRACKING DOWN THE PINIONS

330
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,666
AND HELPING OUT THE
CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

331
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,333
THEREFORE, I WILL REWARD YOU.

332
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:10,458
- WHAT?

333
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,375
- DOES SHE MEAN REALLY?

334
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,083
IS... IS IT OKAY?

335
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,916
- HAVE SOME
MELON BREAD. ENJOY!

336
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,125
- HUH?

337
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,041
- YOU WERE SAYING? GO ON!

338
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,291
- ANYWAY, YOU CAN'T
GO AFTER YUJI.

339
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:43,125
- SURE I CAN. YOU ARE
BEING SO UNFAIR ABOUT THIS,

340
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:45,291
AND I'M GONNA TELL
SAKAI THAT I LOVE HIM.

341
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,500
AND WHEN I DO,
YOU'LL BE OUT OF THE PICTURE.

342
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,291
- IT IS NOT UNFAIR.

343
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:52,333
YOU CAN'T GO AFTER HIM,
'CAUSE YUJI IS MY...

344
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,833
YUJI IS MY WHAT?

345
00:22:57,541 --> 00:23:00,833
BELIEVE ME, IT'S BETTER FOR
YUJI TO BE WITH ME THAN YOU.

346
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:04,375
- THAT IS NOT TRUE. SAKAI SHOULD
BE THE ONE TO DECIDE THAT.

347
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:06,875
- BUT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT YUJI.

348
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,416
- I'LL GET TO KNOW HIM.

349
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,166
- YOU CAN'T!
- WHY NOT?

350
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,625
- BECAUSE I SAY SO.

351
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,958
- I SAID WHAT I HAD TO SAY.

352
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,583
- FORGET IT.
I WON'T LOSE TO YOU.

353
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,958
- ( theme song playing )

354
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:30,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

355
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:59,791
- Yuji: THE FLAME-HAIRED
BLAZING-EYED FLAME HAZE.

356
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:02,833
ONCE THERE WAS A FAMOUS LADY WHO
HAD A GREAT INFLUENCE ON HER.

357
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:06,666

ABOUT WIRHELMINA CARMEL.
