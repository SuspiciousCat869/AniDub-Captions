1
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,791
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,500
LIVES CONSUMED IN

3
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,791
SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.
NO ONE CAN TELL WHEN

4
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,625
THE WORLD IS DISPLACED,
AND THE FLAMES OF THE

5
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:45,083
CRIMSON WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,833
- ( theme song playing )

7
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

8
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,000
( Mr. Kondo whistles )

9
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:25,791
- RIGHT, THE LAST
15 MINUTES WILL BE FREE TIME

10
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:29,750
- YAY.
- CANNONBALL.

11
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,333
- Mr. Kondo: HEY, CAN IT.
THAT WAS A DANGEROUS STUNT.

12
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,791
- Male student: ALL RIGHT.

13
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,666
- YOU LOOK A LITTLE LOST
WITHOUT YOUR BUDDY HERE.

14
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,583
WHAT HAPPENED?
DID YOU GUYS FIGHT?

15
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:43,083
- NO, THAT ISN'T IT.
- AWW.

16
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,833
- SO I GUESS SATO
REALLY IS SICK TODAY.

17
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,500
- YEAH, HE IS.

18
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,958
BUT HEY, OGA-CHAN,
ARE YOU WORRIED

19
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,333
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T SHOW UP TODAY?

20
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,458
- HUH? IDIOT.

21
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,833
- ( sighs )

22
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,875
- DO YOU HAVE
FEELINGS FOR YOSHIDA?

23
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,416
- Do I?

24
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,333
- I'M GONNA MAKE SURE
I TELL HIM MY FEELINGS.

25
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,416
- NO, YUJI'S MINE.

26
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,000
- ( gasps )

27
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:29,625
- I'M GOING TO TELL HIM.
TELL HIM PROPERLY.

28
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:32,666
- HUH?

29
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,458
- I SAID, DO YOU
THINK THAT'S RIGHT?

30
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,125
IF YOU KEEP PLAYING
GAMES LIKE THIS,

31
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,291
YOU'RE GONNA END UP
HURTING SOMEONE.

32
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,416
- HMM.

33
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:45,916
- ( sighs )

34
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,375
- IT'S ALL RIGHT. I CAN SAY IT.

35
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,375
AS LONG AS I GET
THE OPPORTUNITY.

36
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:58,125
- I WON'T LOSE.
I'LL NEVER LOSE TO HER.

37
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,416
- Sydonay: THE PALACE OF THE
STARS IS PRACTICALLY EMPTY.

38
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,875
WHAT ARE YOU UPTO?

39
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,708
- WE'RE PLANNING ON USING
THE PALACE AS A VESSEL,

40
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,541
FOR THE TREASURE OF TREASURES,

41
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:42,083
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD
AND FOR HECATE'S SAKE.

42
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,666
- Sydonay: ARE YOU
OKAY WITH THAT, HECATE?

43
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,625
- IF BEL PEOL WISHES,
THEN SO BE IT.

44
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:55,125
- AH, SHE'S WITHDRAWN AGAIN.
- MYSTERIOUS, YES.

45
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,250
BUT SHE THINKS ANSWERS WILL
COME TO HER WHEN SHE DOES IT.

46
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:02,916
- MY HECATE IS ALL ABOUT PURITY.
I JUST LOVE THAT ABOUT HER.

47
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,833
- ( chuckles )

48
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:08,750
- THIS LATEST PLAN, IT ISN'T
GOING TO HARM HER, IS IT?

49
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,791
- AH, NO. IN FACT,

50
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,333
IT SHOULD MAKE HER AN
EXISTENCE FOR ALL ETERNITY

51
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,958
EVEN AS WE SPEAK, SOMEONE
PERFECT FOR THE JOB

52
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,458
IS SETTING IT ALL UP,

53
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,541
ALTHOUGH I STILL HAVE SOME
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT HIM.

54
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,458
- ( birds chirping )

55
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:35,916
- SO WHY AM I TRAINING ALONE?
WHAT'S SHANA DOING ANYWAY?

56
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,750
- Alastor: SHE DID NOT
SEE FIT TO TELL ME.

57
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,500
- YEAH BUT THIS IS THE FIRST
TIME THIS HAS EVER HAPPENED,

58
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,916
AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER.

59
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,208
DO YOU THINK SOMETHING
IMPORTANT HAS COME UP?

60
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,083
- Alastor: STOP TALKING
UNNECESSARILY.

61
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,250
PICK UP YOUR PACE.

62
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,750
- YEAH, YEAH.

63
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,708
- THERE, YOU'RE ALL SET.

64
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,541
BUT SERIOUSLY, YOU'VE NEVER
DONE ANY COOKING BEFORE?

65
00:05:56,625 --> 00:06:01,708
- NONE. WIRHELMINA TOLD ME THAT
KIND OF TRAINING WASN'T NEEDED.

66
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,416
- MISS WIRHELMINA IS THE PERSON
WHO USED TO LIVE WITH

67
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,041
MR. ALASTOR, RIGHT?

68
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,166
- MMM.

69
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,333
- PREPARING A BOX LUNCH
MIGHT BE DIFFICULT

70
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,916
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
EXPERIENCE AT ALL.

71
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,958
- HUH?

72
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,625
- DOES IT HAVE TO
BE A BOX LUNCH?

73
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,875
- MMM.

74
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,250
- DID YU-CHAN ASK
YOU TO MAKE HIM THIS?

75
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,791
- UH...

76
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,583
IT'S JUST, WELL...
I DIDN'T FEEL GOOD

77
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:39,291
WATCHING YUJI EAT THE BOX LUNCH
KAZUMI YOSHIDA MADE FOR HIM.

78
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:43,333
- KAZUMI YOSHIDA?
- SHE CAN COOK.

79
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,791
- WELL, LET'S START
WITH SOMETHING SIMPLE,

80
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,208
LIKE YOUR BASIC OMELETTE.

81
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,333
- SURE.

82
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,333
- ( panting )

83
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,375
- DON'T STOP, KEEP RUNNING.

84
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:03,041
- JUST HANG ON A SECOND.
LEMME CATCH MY BREATH, OKAY?

85
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:06,875
- YOU DISAPPOINT ME.
ALL RIGHT, JUST FOR A MOMENT.

86
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,750
- YEAH, YEAH.
- A SINGLE YES WILL DO.

87
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:17,791
- RIGHT, THE MISAGO FESTIVAL.
IT'S TOMORROW.

88
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,750
- WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING TO?

89
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:23,458
- UH, LOOK. IT'S AN ANNUAL
FESTIVAL. IT'S A PRETTY BIG ONE.

90
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,958
I USED TO GO TO IT ALL THE
TIME WITH MY MOM AND DAD.

91
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:35,333
- CANDY APPLES, MY FAVORITE.
- HMM?

92
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,958
- A SNACK. THEY SELL THEM
IN THE NIGHT STALLS.

93
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,458
I KNOW, I SHOULD COME
WITH SHANA TOMORROW.

94
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,875
- HMM, BUT I GUESS SHE'S NOT TOO
INTERESTED IN FESTIVALS.

95
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:49,250
- OF COURSE SHE ISN'T.
RESUME YOUR TRAINING.

96
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,833
- YEAH, YEAH.
- A SINGLE YES WILL DO.

97
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,125
- ( barking )

98
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,500
- OH, IT'S OKAY.
DON'T BE SCARED.

99
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,041
IT'S JUST A DECORATION
FOR THE FESTIVAL.

100
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:03,000
THE MISAGO FESTIVAL. IT'S THAT
TIME OF YEAR ALL READY.

101
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,500
- ( sighs )

102
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,208
- ( gasps )

103
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:13,125
- I KNOW, I'LL ASK SAKAI
TO THE FESTIVAL,

104
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,583
AND THAT'S WHERE
I'LL TELL HIM HOW I FEEL.

105
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:22,083
LET'S GO HOME EKATERINA. I'VE
GOTTA GET READY FOR SCHOOL.

106
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,208
- I THINK IT'S MY FAULT
FOR NOT WATCHING YOU MAKE IT.

107
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,125
- IT IS YOUR
FIRST TIME, AFTER ALL.

108
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,708
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

109
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,500
IT'S BECAUSE I HAVEN'T
TRAINED ENOUGH.

110
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,791
- CALLING THIS "TRAINING" SEEMS
LIKE A BIT OF AN EXAGGERATION.

111
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,541
THE IMPORTANT
THING ABOUT COOKING

112
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,625
IS THAT YOU DO IT OUT OF LOVE.

113
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,791
- HUH? OUT OF LOVE?

114
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,416
- GEE, WHAT DO I START WITH?
IT ALL LOOKS SO GOOD.

115
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,750
- HMM.

116
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,416
- SHANA-CHAN,
WE'LL TAKE OUR TIME

117
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,416
AND LEARN THE BASICS PROPERLY.

118
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,458
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? THE MISAGO
FESTIVAL IS TOMORROW.

119
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,583
YOU SHOULD GO TO IT
WITH YU-CHAN.

120
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,333
- FESTIVAL? ONE OF
THOSE NOISY CELEBRATIONS?

121
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:12,000
- THEY'RE A LOT OF FUN. LISTEN,
COME HERE RIGHT AFTER SCHOOL.

122
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,125
- I'LL GET YOU A YUKATA.
- HMM.

123
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,375
- BUT DON'T TELL HIM
YOU'RE WEARING ONE.

124
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,958
YU-CHAN WILL BE DAZZLED
WHEN HE SEES HOW PRETTY

125
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,750
YOU LOOK IN YOUR YUKATA.

126
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,083
- YOU THINK SO?

127
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,416
- ( door opens )

128
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,291
- Yuji: I'M HOME.

129
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,708
- ( gasps )

130
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,750
- ( whirring )

131
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:39,916
- ( sniffs ) THAT'S WEIRD,
I SMELL SOMETHING BURNT.

132
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,041
- REALLY?

133
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,375
- YUJI, DID YOU FINISH
YOUR TRAINING?

134
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,666
- I SURE DID. SO, WHY DIDN'T
YOU COME OUT TODAY, SHANA?

135
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,416
- NO REASON.
- HMM.

136
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,083
- UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?
GO AHEAD, SHANA.

137
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,833
I HAVE TO GO AND BUY SOMETHING.

138
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,333
YOSHIDA'S REALLY NICE,

139
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,708
BUT I SHOULDN'T BE EATING
HER BOX LUNCHES.

140
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,291
- Clerk: THANK YOU, COME AGAIN.

141
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:17,000
- YOSHIDA. ER...

142
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,125
- JUST SAY IT. IF I DON'T FIND
THE COURAGE TO SAY IT NOW,

143
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,875
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO.

144
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,708
AND I'LL REGRET IT FOREVER.

145
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,916
- I WAS JUST UH...
- SAKAI.

146
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,958
- YES?

147
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:31,166
- TOMORROW, IT'S
THE MISAGO FESTIVAL.

148
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,208
DO YOU WANNA GO TO IT WITH ME?

149
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,791
- YOSHIDA...

150
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,083
- Boy: SO, YOU GOIN' TO
THE FESTIVAL TOMORROW?

151
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,666
SUPPOSED TO BE PRETTY COOL
THIS YEAR.

152
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,375
THEY'VE EVEN GOT A
BLIMP AND STUFF.

153
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,958
- YEAH, BUT IT WON'T
BE MUCH FUN JUST US TWO.

154
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:17,291
HEY, LET'S ASK SOME GIRLS TO GO.

155
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,333
- ( gasps )

156
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,958
- HEY, GOOD MORNING, IKE.
- HI.

157
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,125
- I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR THE OTHER DAY.

158
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,916
I KNOW YOU SAID THOSE THINGS
BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO HELP ME.

159
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,583
- YOU KNOW, I SHOULD LEARN
TO KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT.

160
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,875
- MMM-MMM.

161
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:45,500
- I DECIDED TO DO WHAT I COULD
TO CHANGE THINGS ON MY OWN.

162
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,583
- HMM?

163
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,250
- IN FACT, YOSHIDA
WENT AND INVITED ME

164
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,750
TO THE MISAGO FESTIVAL TOMORROW.

165
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,750
- SO, YOU GOING?
- UH, YEAH.

166
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,000
- I SEE.

167
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:13,041
- BUT I DO UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU SAID TO ME BEFORE, IKE.

168
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,458
- I THINK I'D BE ANGRIER
IF YOU TURNED HER DOWN

169
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,791
JUST BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT
I SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE WITH HER.

170
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:22,625
THE TRUTH IS, I'M STILL NOT SURE
WHETHER I HAVE FEELINGS FOR HER.

171
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,750
WHEN I KNOW FOR SURE,
THEN I'LL FIGHT FOR HER.

172
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
- HMM, RIGHT.

173
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,625
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
IT'LL BE MORE FUN AS A GROUP.

174
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,583
- OH, FOR SURE.

175
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,208
TANAKA, YOU WANT ME
TO COUNT YOU IN?

176
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,291
IT'S THE MISAGO FESTIVAL TOUR.

177
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:44,708
- UH, SORRY, NO.
I'VE KINDA GOT OTHER PLANS.

178
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:50,125
- OH, THAT'S OKAY. I WAS ONLY
JOKING. I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN IT.

179
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,125
- UNTIL NOW, FESTIVALS
NEVER MEANT ANYTHING TO ME.

180
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,708
- YU-CHAN WILL BE DAZZLED
WHEN HE SEES HOW PRETTY

181
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,000
YOU LOOK IN YOUR YUKATA.

182
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,541
- IT SOUNDS LIKE
THIS COULD BE FUN.

183
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,375
- ( groaning )

184
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:11,125
- Marco: HI!.
HOW YA FEELIN' BOSS?

185
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,166
- I'M GONNA REST
IN HERE FOR A WHILE.

186
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,875
- WHAT HAPPENED? WERE YOU
KICKED OUT OF A BAR AGAIN?

187
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,500
- ( coughs )

188
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,041
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SLEEP IN THEM YOU KNOW?

189
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,416
GO AHEAD AND USE ONE
OF THE OTHER ROOMS,

190
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,750
THERE'S NOBODY HERE.

191
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,750
- Marco: IF WE GET TOO
ATTACHED TO THIS PLACE,

192
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,291
IT'LL MAKE THINGS MORE
DIFFICULT WHEN WE LEAVE.

193
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,916
- BESIDES, YOUR MAID KEEPS
THIS PLACE TOO CLEAN FOR ME.

194
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,375
- IF THERE'S ONE THING
MY PARENTS INSIST ON,

195
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,333
IT'S MAKING SURE
THE HOUSE IS CLEAN.

196
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,416
- Marco: BUT THANKS TO THEM,

197
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,500
WE'VE GOT A PLACE WE CAN
ALWAYS STAY AT.

198
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,791
( laughs ) YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW WE APPRECIATE THAT.

199
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,250
- YEAH, I GUESS. THAT'S
A LOAD OFF MY MIND.

200
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,375
- HUH?

201
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,458
YOU'RE STILL A CHILD.

202
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,791
YOU JUST WANT SOMEONE
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU, RIGHT?

203
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,458
- ( laughs )

204
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,166
- WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING?

205
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,791
- Marco: LEAVE HIM ALONE,
YOU'LL GIVE HIM A FEVER.

206
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:16,166
- OH COME ON, LOOK AT HIM.
HE'S ALL READY GETTING BETTER.

207
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,958
WELL, I'M GONNA GO TAKE A NAP.

208
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,583
- ( sighs )

209
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,875
CATCH YOU LATER.

210
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,166
- I ACTUALLY INVITED HIM.

211
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:48,875
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO
TELL HIM TOMORROW.

212
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,500
- HMM.
- Clerk: THANKS FOR COMING.

213
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,916
- ( chuckles )

214
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,750
- HUH?

215
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,041
- Khamsin: SO, TELL ME.
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

216
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,375
- WHAT?

217
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,583
- I PICKED UP A STRONG SCENT,
INDICATING THAT...

218
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,875
- Behemoth: HMM, PERHAPS
IT'S COMING FROM SOMEONE

219
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,458
WHO'S CLOSE TO THE GIRL,

220
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,916
SOMEONE WHO'S TRYING
TO HIDE HIM OR HERSELF.

221
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,791
- YEAH, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

222
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,000
- WHAT WAS THAT?

223
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,750
- OH, I GUESS IT'S TIME FOR
INTRODUCTIONS.

224
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:36,458
I AM MOBILIZER OF
CEREMONIAL EQUIPMENT, KHAMSIN.

225
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:37,666
- AND THIS IS...

226
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:42,416
- I AM BEHEMOTH, THE
STEADFAST SHARP PEAK.

227
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,458
- WE ARE HERE TO ASK YOU
FOR YOUR COOPERATION.

228
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:49,916
WE THINK YOU'D BE PERFECT
FOR AN IMPORTANT JOB WE HAVE.

229
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,458
THERE'S NO DANGER.

230
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:55,375
WE ARE HERE TO FIX THE
DISTORTION WITHIN YOUR CITY.

231
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:58,000
NO, PLEASE DON'T BE FRIGHTENED.

232
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,541
LOOK THROUGH
THIS AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

233
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:04,916
- SEE HOW THE WORLD REALLY IS.
- THIS WORLD?

234
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:08,583
- HERE.

235
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:21,583
LOOK.

236
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,083
- ( gasps )

237
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,625
- ( wind howling )

238
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,500
- ( gasps )

239
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:45,583
- MARCOSIAS.

240
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,416
- Marco: YEAH, THEY'RE
HERE ALL RIGHT.

241
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,041
ALTHOUGH THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE
DOING ANYTHING. JUST OBSERVING.

242
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,125
- YOU' RE RIGHT. HMM.

243
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,541
- Tanaka: YOU MEAN
WITH BIG SISTER?

244
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,291
- Sato: IF MARGERY AND MARCO
DECIDE TO LEAVE THE CITY,

245
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,791
THEN I'M GONNA JOIN 'EM.

246
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:10,875
- HMM. THEN, I'LL GO TOO.
WE SHOULD START TRAINING FOR IT.

247
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,875
- TORCHES, THEY
REPLACE DEAD PEOPLE

248
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,916
WHO WERE EATEN BY MONSTERS...
IN THIS CITY?

249
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,416
- ( child laughing )

250
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,208
- ( laughing )

251
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,958
- WHAT ABOUT MY FAMILY?

252
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,583
WHAT'LL I DO IF THEY'RE...

253
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,083
IS MY FAMILY OKAY?

254
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:04,583
- PLEASE REST ASSURED.
YOUR FAMILY IS QUITE UNHARMED.

255
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,625
IT'S ONE OF THE CONDITIONS TO
HAVING YOU COOPERATE WITH US.

256
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,333
- THEY'RE SAFE?

257
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:14,541
- MY FATHER, MY MOTHER
AND MY LITTLE BROTHER, KEN?

258
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:17,500
- ( sighs in relief )

259
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,916
- ( gasps )

260
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,541
- HANG ON, WHAT ABOUT...

261
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,041
WHAT ABOUT SAKAI?

262
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,375
- TONIGHT WE'LL WORK ON
CONTROLLING POWER OF EXISTENCE.

263
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,666
- UH-HUH.

264
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,041
HEY SHANA, SINCE
TOMORROW'S SATURDAY,

265
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,208
OUR TRAINING'S IN THE
AFTERNOON, RIGHT?

266
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,458
- TOMORROW EVENING'S OKAY.
- UH, REALLY?

267
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,875
- I SAID SO, DIDN'T I?
- HMM.

268
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,708
- LET'S GET STARTED.
- HMM.

269
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,250
THAT'LL WORK. I CAN TRAIN WHEN
I GET BACK FROM THE FESTIVAL.

270
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,416
- YUJI, FOCUS.
- UH...

271
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,666
- I WANT YOU TO TRY
TO CONTROL THE AMOUNT

272
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,666
OF POWER OF EXISTENCE
YOU SEND TO ME.

273
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,458
- HUH? HMM.

274
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:15,166
- THIS TIME, GATHER AND RELEASE
IT IN A KIND OF EXPLOSION,

275
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,500
BUT MAKE SURE TO KEEP ENOUGH
FOR YOUR OWN EXISTENCE.

276
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:21,916
YUJI.

277
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,208
ALL YOU DID WAS INCREASE
THE AMOUNT YOU SENT TO ME.

278
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,375
YOU HAVE TO CAUSE
A BRIEF EXPLOSION.

279
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,458
YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF POWER OF
EXISTENCE TO PLAY AROUND WITH,

280
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,541
BUT RELEASE IT ALL AT ONCE
AND IT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

281
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,833
- I'M HAVING TROUBLE JUDGING
HOW MUCH TO LEAVE BEHIND.

282
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:43,625
I'M NOT SURE WHAT A SAFE AMOUNT
IS FOR MY OWN EXISTENCE.

283
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,833
- Alastor: COME MIDNIGHT, THE
MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD

284
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:50,041
WITHIN YOU WILL FULLY RECHARGE
YOUR POWER OF EXISTENCE.

285
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,333
SO DON'T BE AFRAID TO USE IT UP.

286
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,083
- I KNOW, BUT...

287
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,333
- EVERY SINGLE NIGHT
YOU'RE OUT HERE PRACTICING.

288
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:05,500
- Marco: SORRY TO BOTHER YOU
ON SUCH A ROMANTIC EVENING.

289
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,250
- Yuji: HUH, GOOD EVENING.

290
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,333
- Shana: IS THIS ABOUT THAT
STRANGER I SENSED?

291
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,666
- YES. QUITE A SIGNIFICANT ONE.

292
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,000
- Marco: SEEMS TO BE A
FLAME HAZE.

293
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,541
IT'S REALLY STARTING
TO PISS ME OFF.

294
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,583
- HUH? IS THIS TRUE?
YOU NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT...

295
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,833
- I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
BECAUSE I SENSED THE VISITOR

296
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,333
WASN'T HERE TO FIGHT.

297
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,333
- WELL, IT IS POSSIBLE
WE HAVE A FLAME HAZE

298
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,291
WHO JUST HAPPENS TO BE
PASSING THROUGH,

299
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,416
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT WE'VE
GOT THIS CRAZY ITEM HERE.

300
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,291
- HUH.

301
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,458
- SO WE SHOULD BE VERY CAUTIOUS.

302
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,708
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE HOW
HAPPY THAT BASTARD WAS

303
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,000
WHEN HE FOUND IT.

304
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,291
- ARE YOU CARRYING...

305
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,333
THAT'S WHY. I UNDERSTAND.

306
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,458
- I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU'VE HEARD THE LATEST,

307
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,000
BUT APPARENTLY SYDONAY IS ONCE
AGAIN A MEMBER

308
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,041
OF THE BALL MASQUE.

309
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,291
- ( gasps )

310
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,666
- Alastor: IS THIS CONFIRMED?
- THE BALL WHAT?

311
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,291
- THE BALL MASQUE,
A DENIZEN GROUP.

312
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,958
- ITS CORE IS COMPRISED OF
THREE POWERFUL DENIZENS

313
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,833
KNOWN AS THE TRINITY.

314
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:03,916
HECATE, BEL PEOL AND THOUGH HE
WAS AWAY FOR SOME TIME, SYDONAY.

315
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,375
- Marco: IF THEY DECIDE
TO MAKE THEIR PRESENCE KNOWN,

316
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:09,000
IT COULD BE TROUBLE
FOR ALL OF US.

317
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,291
- IT MAY BE TIME TO PLAN
IN WHAT DIRECTION

318
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,458
WE WISH TO GO FROM
THIS POINT ON.

319
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,041
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING, YUJI SAKAI?

320
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,625
- UH, DIRECTION?

321
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,041
- I'M TALKING ABOUT
LEAVING THE CITY.

322
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,125
- HMM?

323
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,541
- THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT
BALL MASQUE WILL COME TO

324
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,500
THE CITY IN AN ATTEMPT
TO ACQUIRE YOU, YUJI.

325
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:37,166
- THEY'RE RIGHT. EVERYONE'S
IN DANGER IF I STAY HERE.

326
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,541
- Khamsin: YES, I APOLOGIZE
FOR EXPOSING YOU

327
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,708
TO THE WORLD'S
REALITIES SO SUDDENLY.

328
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,500
HOWEVER, IF YOU'RE GOING
TO COOPERATE WITH US,

329
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,625
I HAD TO MAKE SURE YOU
UNDERSTOOD THE TRUTH

330
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,958
AND IRREGULARITIES
OF THIS WORLD.

331
00:21:57,041 --> 00:22:00,375
LIKE YOU SAW EARLIER, THERE ARE
MANY TORCHES IN THIS CITY.

332
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,375
IT'S BADLY WARPED.

333
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:05,333
RESTORING THE ORDER OF THINGS
AND REPAIRING SUCH WARPS

334
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,666
IS OUR JOB.

335
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,041
- Behemoth: HMM, IN FACT,
HE'S KNOWN AS A "TUNER."

336
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:13,208
- IN ORDER TO TUNE A LOCATION,
WE REQUIRE THE COOPERATION

337
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,125
OF A HUMAN BEING WHO
WAS BORN AND RAISED...

338
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,916
- WHAT ABOUT SAKAI?

339
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:18,916
OH, SAKAI.

340
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,625
- WE WON'T LEAVE YET.
- RECKLESS MOVES ARE DANGEROUS.

341
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:33,958
- LEAVE THIS CITY?

342
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:37,333
TOGETHER. WITH SHANA.

343
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:53,458
- ( Professor laughs )

344
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:58,291
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE FALLING
INTO PLACE, AS EXPECTED.

345
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,500
- OH THAT VOICE. IT IS HIM.

346
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:11,083
- THE BALL MASQUE, I'M
SENSING STRANGE MOVEMENTS

347
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:12,875
AT THE PALACE OF THE STARS.

348
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,666
- Tiamat: THE
MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

349
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,500
- AS SOON AS WE'RE DONE HERE,
WE'LL LOOK INTO IT.

350
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,791
- ( theme song playing )

351
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

352
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,250
- Yuji: THE PROFESSOR IS GOING
TO CONDUCT AN EXPERIMENT

353
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,583
AT THE MISAGO FESTIVAL.

354
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,708
IN THE CONFUSION,
THE GIRLS' HEARTS REFLECT

355
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:04,208
THEIR PERSONAL DELUSIONS.

356
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:07,291
SHANA'S FACE SHOWS AN EMOTION
SHE'S NEVER KNOWN BEFORE.

357
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:10,000
NEXT EPISODE,
"A SHATTERED WISH."
