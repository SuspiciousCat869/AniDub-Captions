1
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,791
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:38,250
LIVES CONSUMED
IN SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.

3
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:41,291
NO ONE CAN TELL
WHEN THE WORLD IS DISPLACED

4
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:45,916
AND THE FLAMES OF THE
CRIMSON WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,583
- ( theme music playing )

6
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,375
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

7
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,708
- Yuji: DURING AN INTENSE BATTLE
WITH A FLAME HAZE

8
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:27,333
KNOWN AS THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES,
SHANA RISES TO THE OCCASION

9
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:30,791
AND DISCOVERS NEW POWERS
WITHIN HER.

10
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:33,083
SHE EMERGES VICTORIOUS

11
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:36,375
AND BOTH FRIEND AND FOE
BID EACH OTHER FAREWELL.

12
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,333
AFTER A STRUGGLE LIKE THAT,

13
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:42,416
IT'S ONLY NATURAL
TO TAKE A BREAK.

14
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,958
BUT AT THE TIME,
I HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING

15
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:48,000
THAT SHANA'S NEXT BATTLE
WAS JUST AROUND THE CORNER.

16
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,708
- Lamies: DON'T GO AFTER SILVER.
- ( gasps )

17
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,916
- YOU'D BE WASTING YOUR TIME.

18
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,041
- GO EASIER.

19
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,416
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
ASKED FOR LESSONS.

20
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,250
- YEAH, I KNOW, BUT STILL.

21
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:07,791
- NO, IT'S JUST A COINCIDENCE.
DON'T WORRY.

22
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,125
I'M SURE I'M WRONG.

23
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:21,916
- MAN, IT'S REALLY SCORCHING.

24
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,250
HOW CAN IT BE THIS HOT
SO EARLY IN THE MORNING?

25
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:28,416
- WELL, IT'S SUMMERTIME, YUJI.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HOT.

26
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,000
- YEAH, I KNOW, BUT--

27
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,916
- I THINK YOU SHOULD PUT MORE OF
YOUR HEART INTO YOUR TRAINING.

28
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,916
WE'VE BEEN TRAINING
EVERY MORNING,

29
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,541
BUT YOU HAVEN'T IMPROVED
ONE BIT.

30
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,416
- ( clanging )

31
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,500
- HEY, GIVE ME A BREAK.

32
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,708
SOME PEOPLE ARE NATURALLY
GIFTED, BUT I'M NOT.

33
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,791
- Alastor: HMM, ALREADY LOOKING
FOR AN EXCUSE.

34
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,583
- HE'S SAYING WE JUST STARTED,

35
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,500
SO DON'T TRY TALKING
YOUR WAY OUT OF THE LESSONS.

36
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:55,250
WE'LL HAVE A BETTER IDEA
OF WHETHER YOU'RE GIFTED OR NOT

37
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:59,583
ONCE YOU'VE LEARNED TO MOVE
ABOUT A LITTLE MORE NATURALLY.

38
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,208
YOU NEED TO FOCUS MORE.

39
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,125
- HEY, WAIT UP!
SHANA!

40
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,916
- YO, THANKS, DUDE!
- THANKS A LOT, IKE!

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,541
- HEY, MAN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

42
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:20,166
- HI. CHECK IT, I SCORED A
BUNCH OF THESE FREE PASSES.

43
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,875
MY DAD'S CONNECTIONS AT WORK
GOT HIM ALL THESE TICKETS

44
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,041
TO MISAKI WATERLAND.

45
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,500
I THOUGHT I'D HAD 'EM OUT
TO THE CLASS.

46
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,000
- ALL RIGHT!
MISAKI WATERLAND!

47
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,375
THAT'S THE PLACE WITH THOSE
COMMERCIALS-- "GET WET!" RIGHT?

48
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,750
- Female Announcer: GET YOUR
BIKINIS ON! MISAKI WATERLAND!

49
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,291
- All: GET WET!

50
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,791
- AW, YEAH!

51
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,791
I FIGURED THESE WOULD
GO OVER PRETTY WELL.

52
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,833
- THEY'RE GONNA LOVE IT.
WAY TO GO, IKE!

53
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,333
- HERE'S YOURS, HIRAI.

54
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,833
- ( bell tolling )

55
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,000
- WE SHOULD GET
NEW BATHING SUITS.

56
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:57,708
- YEAH, LET'S GO SHOPPING.
- MMM.

57
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:01,125
THERE'S HIS STUNNED LOOK
AGAIN.

58
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:04,500
- HEY, SHANA,
WE'VE BOTH GOT FREE TICKETS.

59
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,833
YOU WANNA GO CHECK THIS PLACE
OUT TOMORROW OR WHAT?

60
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,125
HUH? SHANA?

61
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,041
- HMM?

62
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,625
WHAT?  WHAT IS IT?
YOU CAN'T HAVE A COMPLAINT.

63
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,583
WE HAVEN'T
EVEN STARTED CLASS YET.  DOH!

64
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,666
- YOUR NECKTIE SUCKS.
- WHAT?

65
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,958
HMM?
IT'S IN STYLE!

66
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,208
- ( sighs )

67
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,458
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YUJI?

68
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:45,000
HIS FACE GETS ALL SLACK OVER A
STUPID PICTURE LIKE THIS.

69
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,458
- Alastor: A TICKET
TO A PLACE OF SWIMMING?

70
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,041
- I GUESS SO.

71
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:52,208
- FOR SOME REASON, HUMAN BEINGS
LIKE TO PLAY AROUND IN WATER.

72
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,458
IT'S ONLY NATURAL THEY WOULD
SEE IT AS A LEISURE ACTIVITY.

73
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,166
- THAT'S NO EXCUSE FOR LETTING
HIS FACE GET ALL LOOSE.

74
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,916
NO WONDER HE CAN'T FOCUS
ON HIS TRAINING.

75
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,333
- Alastor: HMM.

76
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,458
- I WAS WONDERING, ALASTOR.

77
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,750
- Alastor: WHAT IS IT?

78
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,000
- DO YOU THINK
THIS WATERLAND PLACE

79
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,875
FEELS AS GOOD AS A BATH DOES?
- Alastor: I HAVE NO IDEA.

80
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,583
- YEAH, I GUESS NOT.

81
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,583
HMM.

82
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,458
- ( bell tolling )

83
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,500
- Boy:
HEY, LET'S EAT ON THE ROOF.

84
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,833
- SHANA'S BEEN GONE
FOR THE WHOLE MORNING.

85
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,375
- Girl:
HI, WHERE'D YOU GO, HIRAI?

86
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,458
- Shana:
I WENT OUT.

87
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,666
- WHERE WERE YOU THIS MORNING?

88
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,666
- I WENT TO A BAKERY.

89
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,500
- UH, A BAKERY?

90
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,166
- MMM.

91
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,166
MMM!
AH, THE BEST YET!

92
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,166
YOU HAVE TO GET
JUST THE RIGHT COMBINATION

93
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,083
OF CRISP AND SPONGY
FOR THE PERFECT MELON BREAD.

94
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:06,250
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
- WELL, SURE, IF YOU SAY SO.

95
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:10,916
- UH, IT'S JUST--
I WAS--

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,250
- HMM?

97
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:21,208
- IT'S JUST-- I-- I WAS THINKING
WE COULD ALL SIT TOGETHER.

98
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,333
YOU KNOW,
AND EAT OUR LUNCHES.

99
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,791
- MMM.

100
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,250
- THIS IS NICE FOR A CHANGE,
ISN'T IT?

101
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,666
DON'T YOU FIND FRIENDS
AND GOOD CONVERSATION

102
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,541
MAKE FOOD TASTE BETTER?
BETTER THAN EATING ALONE.

103
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,166
- MM-HMM.
FOR SURE.

104
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,458
- I--

105
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,333
AAH!
- HMM?

106
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,291
- I-- I MEAN--

107
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,333
THAT IS--
YA SEE, WELL--

108
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,833
I-- IT'S JUST--

109
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,083
SAKAI!

110
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,958
- UH, WHAT IS IT?

111
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:06,916
- WELL, I WAS WONDERING, YOU--
YOU ALWAYS BRING RICE BALLS

112
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,458
FROM THE CONVENIENCE STORE
FOR YOUR LUNCH.

113
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,916
- YEAH, IT'S MY MOM.

114
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,416
SHE SAYS A MAN WHO COUNTS ON HIS
MOTHER FOR THREE MEALS A DAY

115
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,625
ISN'T GONNA GO VERY FAR IN LIFE,
OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES.

116
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,291
- SHE SAYS THAT?
- YEAH.

117
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,958
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAY IT?

118
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,833
YOU WERE GONNA INVITE HIM TO
MISAKI WATERLAND, WEREN'T YOU?

119
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,875
- BUT-- BUT IT'S HARD.

120
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,791
- GUYS! I JUST HAD A GREAT IDEA!

121
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,708
SINCE IKE WAS NICE ENOUGH
TO GIVE US THESE TICKETS,

122
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,666
WHY DON'T WE ALL GO TO WATERLAND
THIS SUNDAY AS A GROUP?

123
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,583
- OGATA, "ALL OF US" MEANS...

124
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,500
EVERYONE?

125
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,708
- YEAH!  WELL, OF COURSE
I DON'T MEAN THE WHOLE CLASS!

126
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,416
BUT EVERYONE HERE FOR SURE.
AND...

127
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,500
MMM, WHAT ABOUT THOSE TWO
OVER THERE?

128
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,416
- All: HUH?  MMM.

129
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,958
- I DON'T MIND AT ALL.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, SAKAI?

130
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,208
- UH, SURE,
SOUNDS GREAT.

131
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,416
- HOW 'BOUT YOU, HIRAI?
- MMM?

132
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,833
- IT WOULDN'T BE THE SAME IF OUR
CLASS HEROINE DIDN'T COME ALONG.

133
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:21,250
- HMM?  YOU WANT ME?

134
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,416
- YEAH, WHY NOT?
LET'S GO.

135
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,166
- SURE, I GUESS.

136
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,041
- THEN IT'S SETTLED!
- HUH?

137
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,916
- WE'LL MEET THERE
10:00 SUNDAY!

138
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,208
AND YOU TWO GUYS
BETTER NOT BE LATE.

139
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:38,083
YOU'VE GOT A REAL REPUTATION
FOR NEVER BEING ON TIME.

140
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,625
- WE'RE NOT GOIN'.
SORRY.

141
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,625
WE DECIDE WHERE WE GO.

142
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:46,916
- OGA-CHAN, SORRY,
WE'VE GOT PLANS.

143
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,916
MAYBE NEXT TIME.

144
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,875
- SHOOT.

145
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:02,333
- YOU KNOW, I KINDA FEEL BAD
FOR OGA-CHAN.

146
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,125
- IT COULDN'T BE HELPED.

147
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,375
DON'T FORGET, WE'RE BUSY
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONE

148
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,125
WHO INSISTED WE TAKE MARGERY
SOMEWHERE HEALTHY THIS WEEKEND.

149
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,916
- I KNOW.
I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND IT.

150
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
BUT EVER SINCE SHE CAME BACK,

151
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,250
SHE'S DONE NOTHING
BUT STAY INSIDE AND DRINK.

152
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,708
WE NEED TO HELP HER.
SHE'S GONNA MAKE HERSELF SICK

153
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,041
IF SHE DOESN'T GET OUT
AND HAVE SOME FUN.

154
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,500
HUH?

155
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,291
- Marco:
WELCOME HOME, YOU TWO.

156
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,166
SHE'S BEEN AN IDIOT
AGAIN TODAY,

157
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,750
MY SLEEPING PRINCESS
OF OVERINDULGENCE, MARGERY DAW.

158
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,875
- HELLO.
YOU BOYS ARE HOME EARLY.

159
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,375
THAT'S A FACT.
( laughs, snores )

160
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,500
- UGH.

161
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,083
- HOW DOES THAT ONE LOOK?

162
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,250
- Yoshida: GOOD, IT'S
NOT TOO SHOWY.

163
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,583
I COULD WEAR THIS.

164
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,541
- ( laughs )

165
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,833
- HUH?

166
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,916
OGATA?
- ( laughs )

167
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,791
- OGATA?

168
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,833
( gasps )
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

169
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,041
- LOOK, YOU'RE GOING
TO THE POOL WITH BOYS.

170
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,041
DON'T WEAR SOMETHING BORING.

171
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:12,000
YOU'RE NOT GETTING YOUR CLOTHES
BACK UNTIL YOU TRY IT ON.

172
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:15,333
- I CAN'T!
- I'M DOING THIS AS A FRIEND!

173
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,916
COME ON,
HURRY UP AND PUT IT ON.

174
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,958
- OKAY.

175
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,791
- WELL, ARE YOU READY?

176
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,625
- ALMOST.

177
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,291
- ARE YOU READY NOW?

178
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,458
- YEAH, I GUESS.
BUT--

179
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,791
- THEN HURRY UP AND SHOW ME!
- AAH!

180
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:35,291
- WOW!
- OGATA!

181
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,875
HAVE MERCY!

182
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,166
- THIS ONE NEXT!

183
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,000
OR WOULD YOU RATHER
TRY THIS ONE ON?

184
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:44,375
- I'D RATHER GO
IN A REGULAR ONE-PIECE, THANKS.

185
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,666
- Chigusa: HERE YOU ARE, SHANA-
CHAN. I GOT YOU A SWIMSUIT.

186
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,041
I KNOW
YOU HAVE A SUIT FOR P.E.,

187
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,416
BUT I THOUGHT YOU'D WANNA WEAR
SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

188
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,916
- OH, WHY'S THAT?

189
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,750
- BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN WEAR
SOMETHING CUTE,

190
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,833
NOT LIKE THE STANDARD ONES
AT SCHOOL.

191
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:03,666
- MMM.
- WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT ON?

192
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,125
- SURE.

193
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,500
- HMM?  UH...

194
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,166
- HMM?

195
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,000
( grunting )

196
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:25,875
- IT'S BEST
IF YOU WAIT OUT HERE.

197
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:29,750
- Alastor: DIDN'T YOU LEARN
ANYTHING FROM THE LAST TIME?

198
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,708
- IT WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING.

199
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,041
- MAN, IT'S GIGANTIC!

200
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,708
- HAVING ONE OF THESE CLOSE BY
MAKES THE SUMMERS BEARABLE.

201
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,666
- IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
TANAKA AND SATO ARE COMING.

202
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,375
THEY'RE NOT EVEN ANSWERING
THE PHONE.

203
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,250
- HMM.

204
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,666
- WELL, WHO CARES
IF THEY DECIDED

205
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,541
THEY HAD SOMETHING BETTER
TO DO?

206
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,041
THE FIVE OF US
WILL HAVE A BLAST!

207
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,375
- IT'LL BE GREAT!

208
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,125
- HMM.

209
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,333
- WHAT IS IT?
- LOOK AT THIS POSTER.

210
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,583
- "COUPLE'S WATER COMPETITION."

211
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,166
- LET'S SEE HERE--
"MIXED COUPLE TEAMS

212
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,208
WILL COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER
IN THE POOL.

213
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:26,875
THE WINNING TEAM WILL RECEIVE
AN ALL-EXPENSES PAID DINNER,

214
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,833
WITH ALL THE FRESH BREAD
YOU CAN EAT,

215
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,208
AT AN EXCLUSIVE RESTAURANT
WITH A NIGHT VIEW."

216
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:34,708
- ALL THE FRESH BREAD
YOU CAN EAT?

217
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:38,166
- DINNER FOR TWO
AT A FANCY RESTAURANT?

218
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,750
- HERE'S TO YOUR BEAUTIFUL EYES.
- OH, THANK YOU.

219
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,875
( sighs )

220
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,916
- LOOKS LIKE FUN!

221
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,500
IT DOESN'T START TILL THIS
AFTERNOON. WHO'S UP FOR IT.

222
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,625
- I'LL DO IT.
- I WANNA GIVE IT A TRY TOO.

223
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,958
- HUH?
- THEN IT'S SETTLED.

224
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,458
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH BOYS,

225
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:02,375
BUT WE'LL DEAL
WITH THAT PROBLEM LATER.

226
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,000
- HMM.

227
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,416
OH, THAT'S HER!

228
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,125
- ( giggling )
SORRY FOR THE WAIT!

229
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,583
- WHERE ARE YOSHIDA AND HIRAI?
- RELAX, THEY'RE COMING.

230
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,541
LET ME PRESENT,
WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,

231
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:17,541
THE YUKARI AND KAZUMI
SWIMSUIT FASHION SHOW.

232
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:22,166
FIRST, MISS HIRAI!
COME ON OUT!

233
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,375
- ( both sigh )

234
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,000
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- Both: NOTHING'S WRONG.

235
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,791
- AND MISS YOSHIDA.
COME ON OUT!

236
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,958
- All: HMM?
- KAZUMI?

237
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,625
- MMM.

238
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,958
HEY, OGATA, I REALLY
DON'T THINK I CAN DO THIS.

239
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,833
- ( grunting )

240
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,541
GO!  GET OUT THERE!

241
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,541
- OH OH!

242
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,125
- Both: AH!

243
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,500
- HMM.

244
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,875
- IT IS SO HOT!
I'M DYING.

245
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,458
- BIG SISTER,
IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

246
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,083
YOU'RE GONNA GET SICK IF YOU
STAY INDOORS ALL THE TIME.

247
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,625
- I'LL BE DEAD
IF I STAY OUT HERE MUCH LONGER.

248
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,500
- YOU MAY BE RIGHT,
BUT STILL--

249
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,333
- HUH?
EITA, WHAT IS THAT?

250
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,666
- MARGERY, DO YOU REALLY
WANNA GO IN THERE?

251
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,500
- BET YOUR ASS I DO.

252
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,041
THIS LOOKS LIKE THE PERFECT
PLACE TO BEAT THE HEAT.

253
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,291
- HEY, LET'S COME BACK
TOMORROW.

254
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,458
TODAY ISN'T THE BEST DAY
FOR VISITING THE PARK.

255
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,708
- HMM?

256
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,333
- HMM.
- SOMETHING WRONG?

257
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,041
- THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES
IS HERE.

258
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,041
- UH, THE CHANTER OF--
THAT WOMAN'S HERE?

259
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,041
- MMM.

260
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,833
I DON'T SENSE ANY ANGER IN HER.

261
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,291
- ( chuckling )
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

262
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:51,083
- YOU TWO ARE.
THESE TOUGH FLAME HAZES

263
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,083
SHOWING UP AT THE POOL
JUST TO RELAX AND HAVE FUN.

264
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,875
IT'S KIND OF AMUSING
IN A WAY.

265
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,208
SHANA, STOP IT!

266
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,583
- SHUT UP!  SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!

267
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:04,583
- I'M GOING TO THE FOOD STAND!
- OKAY.

268
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,875
- LOOK WHERE WE ARE.
- WE DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

269
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,000
ONCE SHE WANTS SOMETHING,
THAT'S IT.

270
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,875
BUT THIS IS A RISK.

271
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:15,000
WHAT IF WE RUN INTO OGA-CHAN
AND THE OTHERS?

272
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,416
- COME ON, WE'LL BE OKAY.

273
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,166
I MEAN, LOOK AT
ALL THE PEOPLE HERE.

274
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,500
CHANCES ARE
WE'LL NEVER EVEN SEE THEM.

275
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:24,500
- ( gasps )
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

276
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,125
- OGA-CHAN!
- YOU BETTER HAVE AN EXCUSE.

277
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,375
- UM, WE CAN EXPLAIN THIS.

278
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,750
- I ONLY ASKED THEM TO GO
AND BUY ME ONE LOUSY DRINK.

279
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,791
WHAT IS TAKING
THOSE TWO SO LONG?

280
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,000
- ( Marco laughing )
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

281
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:39,875
THEY FINALLY HAD ENOUGH
OF THE BOTTOMLESS BOOZEHOUND.

282
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,250
OW!

283
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,875
- Ogata:
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

284
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,291
YOU TURNED DOWN MY INVITATION
TO COME,

285
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,916
AND THEN YOU SHOW UP ANYWAY?

286
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,625
DID YOU TWO COME HERE
WITH SOMEONE ELSE?

287
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,625
- WHAT'S GOING ON BACK THERE?
- DON'T KNOW.

288
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:58,416
I'M NOT SURE, BUT IT SOUNDS
LIKE A CASE OF JEALOUSY TO ME.

289
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,041
- Tanaka: WELL, YOU SEE-- 
- TELL ME!

290
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,750
- ( gasps )

291
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,958
- SO YOU REALLY DID COME HERE
JUST TO RELAX BY THE POOL?

292
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,083
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

293
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,166
I DON'T FEEL LIKE GETTING
INTO A TUSSLE WITH YOU.

294
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,125
FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO FIGHT.
( moans, exhales )

295
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:19,333
ALL THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES
WANTS RIGHT NOW

296
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,625
IS TO LIE BY THE POOL
WITH A COOL DRINK.

297
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:26,125
- Alastor: WELL, I SEE HER DAYS
AS A FLAME HAZE ARE OVER.

298
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,750
- HMM.

299
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,500
NOT THAT IT MATTERS TO US
WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO.

300
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,291
- THEN YOU SAID
YOU WEREN'T COMING YESTERDAY

301
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,958
BECAUSE YOU WANTED
TO SURPRISE US?

302
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,666
- YEAH, THAT'S IT.
WE THOUGHT IF WE JUST SAID YES,

303
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,750
EVERYONE WOULDN'T BE THAT
APPRECIATIVE OF OUR PRESENCE.

304
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,583
RIGHT, SATO?
- YEAH.

305
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,291
WELL, WE THOUGHT WE'D SHOW UP
SUDDENLY

306
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,000
AND MAKE THINGS INTERESTING
FOR YOU.  RIGHT, TANAKA?

307
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,041
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- HUH.

308
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,541
AND YOU NEVER BOTHERED
TO TELL ME.

309
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,250
- LIKE I SAID,
I'M REAL SORRY.

310
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,125
- HMM.

311
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,791
THEN YOU WON'T MIND HELPING US
IN THE WATER FIGHT!

312
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,291
- WATER FIGHT?

313
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,958
- GOT THAT? THE PERSON AT THE
OTHER END WILL BE YOUR PARTNER.

314
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,208
THE ODD MAN OUT
WILL CHEER THEM ON, OKAY?

315
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,875
- WHAT DO WE DO? BIG SISTER
IS STILL WAITING FOR US.

316
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,875
- WHAT OTHER CHOICE
DO WE HAVE?

317
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,958
BETTER TO PLAY ALONG THAN TO
HAVE THEM FIND OUT ABOUT HER.

318
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,916
- OKAY, I'M LETTING GO.

319
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,583
- ( both chuckling )

320
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:33,083

00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,375
- WHERE'S IKE? HE SAID HE WAS
JUST GOING TO THE BATHROOM.

328
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,625

- YEAH, OKAY!

342
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,291
TRY RELAXING A BIT MORE.
- I'LL TRY.

343
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,875
- ( grunts )

344

348
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,250
- THERE'S NO SENSE
JUMPING ON EACH OTHER.

349
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,500
LET'S TARGET OTHER TEAMS FIRST.
- OKAY.

350
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,958
GOOD IDEA!

351
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,208

HOWEVER...

357
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,583

358
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,750
- YOU'VE GOTTA KEEP YOUR WITS
ABOUT YOU IN THIS KINDA FIGHT.

359
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,083
- THEY'RE A STRONG TEAM,

360
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,291
BUT THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE USING
THEIR HEADS MUCH.

361
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,916
- ( all grunting )

362
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:20,166
- UH-HUH!
WHO'S NEXT?

363
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,541
- HIRAI'S PRETTY AWESOME.

364
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,208
- SATO'S RUNNING HIS LEGS OFF.

365
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,791
- LET'S MAKE SURE WE STAY
FAR AWAY FROM THAT TEAM.

366
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,625
- YOU BETCHA.
- FOLKS!

367
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,625
THERE ISN'T THAT MUCH TIME LEFT,

368
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,916
AND THERE AREN'T THAT MANY
COUPLES LEFT WITH HEADBANDS.

369
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,500
- HEY, YOSHIDA, WE'RE LUCKY
TO HAVE MADE IT THIS FAR.

370
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,708
LET'S JUST WAIT FOR THE TIME
TO RUN OUT.

371
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,541
WE WON'T WIN, BUT I'M SURE WE'LL
GET SOMETHING FOR SURVIVING.

372
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,083
- YEAH, SURE.

373
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,041
I'M JUST HAPPY
I WAS ABLE

374
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,250
TO SPEND THIS MUCH TIME
ALONE WITH HIM.

375
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,583
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

376
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,791
- UH, YOSHIDA,
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

377
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,791
- HUH?  NO!
EVERYTHING'S JUST PERFECT!

378
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,541

380
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,333

381
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:05,791
- OKAY.
- STOP!

382
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,416
- WHAT ARE THOSE GUYS DOING?
- YUJI!

383
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,958
- YEAH.
- WHY ARE YOU RUNNING?

384
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,083
- WHY ARE YOU CHASING US?

385
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,166
YOU'VE ALREADY WON.
LEAVE OUR HEADBAND ALONE!

386
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,083
- SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!  SHUT UP!

387
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,833
THIS IS STILL PART
OF THE TRAINING!

388
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,750
- YOU'RE TALKIN' CRAZY!
- I AM NOT TALKING CRAZY!

389
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:24,500
- THEY SEEM COMFORTABLE
WITH EACH OTHER.  MUST BE NICE.

390
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,625
- YOSHIDA, BEND DOWN.
SHE'S RIGHT THERE.

391
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,083
- UH?

392
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,375
- LOOK, PICK UP THE PACE,
WILL YA?

393
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,208
- THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.
- YUJI, STOP!

394
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,708
- I'M NOT STOPPING!

395
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,375
- IS SHE ANGRY
BECAUSE SAKAI AND I

396
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,500
ARE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME
TOGETHER?

397
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,958
BUT WHY WOULD SHE CARE?

398
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,125
- FASTER!  FASTER!

399
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:49,291
- I'M ABOUT DONE.
- STAND STILL, YUJI!

400
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,208
- AAH!  SHE'S ON OUR TAIL.
DON'T STOP!

401
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,791
DON'T STOP!

402
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:57,500
- HA!  GOTCHA!
YOU'RE MINE!

403
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,416
AAH!

404
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,125
- ( whistle blows )

405
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,875
LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT
A SURPRISE WINNER, FOLKS!

406
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,125
THE OKADA TEAM!

407
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:19,666
- ( both cheering )
- MR. OKADA WAS IN THE CONTEST?

408
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:24,208
- YOU KNOW, SHOULD THAT COUNT?
- I WONDER IF THAT'S HIS WIFE.

409
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:26,458
- Yuji: HEY, WHY DID YOU
HAVE TO COME AFTER US?

410
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:30,125
- YOUR FAULT.
- MY FAULT?  WHY IS THAT?

411
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,333
- SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!  SHUT UP!

412
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:35,750
- YOU KNOW, SHANA,
YOU'RE ALWAYS SAYING...

413
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:38,833
- YOUNG MAN, HAVE A SIP?

414
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:41,291
OH, YEAH, YOU'RE TOO YOUNG
TO HAVE A DRINK.

415
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,375
SUCKS TO BE YOU.

416
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:45,291
- WHO IS THIS WOMAN ANYWAY?

417
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:48,791
IT'S PRETTY LATE.
I WONDER HOW EVERYONE'S DOING.

418
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:53,791
- ( yawning )

419
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:56,541
- WE'RE SORRY,
BUT WE COULDN'T HELP IT.

420
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,416
WE DIDN'T MEAN
TO LEAVE YOU ALONE.

421
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,625
- AH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

422
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:04,250
WHAT WAS I USING FOR A PILLOW?
MY NECK HURTS.

423
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:07,333
- I'D SAY THAT WAS
A PRETTY FUN DAY, ALL IN ALL.

424
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:10,666
 WELL, TOMORROW'S MONDAY.
I'LL SEE YOU AT SCHOOL.

425
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,791
- YEAH, TAKE IT EASY.

426
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:16,916
- SEE YA TOMORROW!
- SO WHY DID YOU COME AFTER ME?

427
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,541
- SHUT UP!
- WHY WON'T YOU TELL ME?

428
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:20,916
- SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!  SHUT UP!

429
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:28,916
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

430
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:58,791
- Yuji: IT'S HARD TO TELL OTHERS
HOW YOU FEEL.

431
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:00,625
SHANA GOES INTO BATTLE ALONE,

432
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,541
HER EARS RINGING
WITH THE SCREAMS OF RINNE.

433
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:06,291
IN THE MEANTIME, MORE DENIZENS
