1
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,000
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:38,125
LIVES CONSUMED
IN SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.

3
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:41,375
NO ONE CAN TELL
WHEN THE WORLD IS DISPLACED

4
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,333
AND THE FLAMES
OF THE CRIMSON WORLD

5
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,875
SWEEP OVER ALL.

6
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,916
- ( theme music playing )

7
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:54,000
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

8
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,291
- Yuji: I GAVE THE GIRL
WHO WAS ONLY A FLAME HAZE

9
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,333
THE NAME SHANA.

10
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:27,083
A SMALL GESTURE,
BUT I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING

11
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,833
BEFORE I EVENTUALLY 
DISAPPEARED FOREVER.

12
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:44,166
- Shana: HE DIDN'T EVEN ASK ME
IF I WANTED A NAME.

13
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,625
HE'S SO INSOLENT
FOR A TORCH.

14
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,166
- Alastor: A NAME.

15
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,708
- WHAT DO I NEED
WITH THAT KIND OF STUFF?

16
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:55,208
A NAME ISN'T GONNA HELP ME
CARRY OUT MY MISSIONS.

17
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:58,083
- Alastor:
HMM, THAT IS TRUE.

18
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,041
- SHA-NA.

19
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,791
MMM.

20
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:07,333
THAT REALLY
IS ONE STRANGE TORCH.

21
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:09,708
- UP UNTIL NOW,

22
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,166
EVERY TORCH EITHER
COLLAPSED IN TEARS

23
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,041
OR BECAME DELUSIONAL
WHILE I TRIED TO EXPLAIN

24
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,666
WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM.

25
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,541
- Alastor: SOME WOULD EVEN
COMMIT SUICIDE.

26
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,291
- YES, BUT HE'S DIFFERENT.

27
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,791
BECAUSE HE'S A MYSTES?

28
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,125
- Alastor:
NO, A TORCH'S TEMPERAMENT

29
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,958
SPRINGS FROM THE ORIGINAL
PERSON'S CHARACTER.

30
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:33,791
THE FACT THAT IT'S A MYSTES
SHOULD MAKE NO REAL DIFFERENCE.

31
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,208
- I WONDER WHAT'S INSIDE IT.

32
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,083
- I DON'T KNOW YET.

33
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,791
BUT IT DOES NOT MATTER.

34
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,041
THE PROBLEM LIES
WITH THE CRIMSON DENIZENS

35
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,916
SEEKING TO ACQUIRE IT.

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,041
- Shana: YEAH, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT KIND OF TORCH IT IS.

37
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,958
BESIDES, IT'LL BE GONE SOON.

38
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,166
THE RESIDUE
EVENTUALLY BURNS OUT.

39
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,833
IT'S GONE AND NOBODY
WILL REMEMBER ITS EXISTENCE.

40
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,375
THERE IS NOTHING LEFT.

41
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,125
- Yuji: I'M NOT GONNA FORGET.

42
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,333
NO MATTER WHAT.

43
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,375
SHE SAID SHE WAS GONNA
KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON ME.

44
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,166
BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN HER YET.

45
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,916
- GOOD MORNING.
- SAKAI.

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,625
WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY?

47
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,166
YOU JUST RAN OUT
OF THE GAME CENTER.

48
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,666
- UH, YEAH.

49
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,208
- YOU SAID
YOU WERE GONNA LOOK FOR HIRAI

50
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,666
AND THEN YOU NEVER CAME BACK.
- HUH?  WHAT?

51
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,291
IKE, YOU REMEMBER THAT HIRAI
WAS WITH US YESTERDAY?

52
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,333
- HUH?

53
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,666
- YOU HAVEN'T
FORGOTTEN ABOUT HER.

54
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,958
- WHY WOULD I FORGET HER?
SHE'S RIGHT OVER THERE.

55
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,625
- ( gasps )

56
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,250
WHAT?  BUT SHE'S...

57
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,083
- RELAX.

58
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,583
- IKE, DO ME A FAVOR.
PASS ME YOUR HOMEWORK.

59
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:54,833
- SURE.

60
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,583
YOU MIGHT WANNA SPLASH
SOME WATER ON YOUR FACE.

61
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,250
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

62
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,458
- I TOLD YOU,
I'M KEEPING AN EYE ON YOU.

63
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,541
- DID YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW ME
IN HERE?

64
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,416
AND YOU'RE SITTING
IN HIRAI'S DESK.

65
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,666
- I'M YUKARI HIRAI NOW.
- HUH?

66
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,333
- I DECIDED TO GO AND WORK
MYSELF INTO HER EXISTENCE.

67
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,750
- ( gasps )

68
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,875
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

69
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,083
- I USED SOME OF THE RESIDUE
FROM YESTERDAY.

70
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,958
SO RIGHT NOW,
I AM YUKARI HIRAI.

71
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,625
- BUT YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE--

72
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,208
- HIRAI, HERE'S THE NOTEBOOK
I BORROWED.

73
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,708
THANKS,
IT SURE CAME IN HANDY.

74
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,208
- THEY DON'T KNOW.
WHY NOT?

75
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,916
- WORKING YOURSELF
INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S EXISTENCE

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,375
HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR PHYSICAL APPEARANCE.

77
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,708
I'M REPLACING THE EXISTENCE
CALLED YUKARI HIRAI,

78
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,500
AND THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE SEES.
- NO WAY.

79
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,500
- I'M DOING THIS TO HELP ME
DEFEAT THAT DENIZEN.

80
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,750
YOU JUST FIND IT STRANGE
BECAUSE WE FILLED YOU IN

81
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,250
ON THE WHOLE PICTURE.
DON'T LET IT BOTHER YOU.

82
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,166
- HA.  BOTHER ME?

83
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,875
HIRAI JUST DISAPPEARED
YESTERDAY AND YOU'VE--

84
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,166
YOU'VE TAKEN OVER
LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED.

85
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,958
- TAKEN OVER?

86
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,625
LOOK, SHE WAS CONSUMED
AND DIED SOME TIME AGO.

87
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,833
I'M JUST MAKING USE
OF A SPACE THAT'S GOING

88
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,083
TO DISAPPEAR ANYWAY.

89
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,041
IT'S PRETTY CONVENIENT
IF YOU ASK ME.

90
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:20,416
- HA!  IT'S NOT ABOUT
WHAT'S CONVENIENT!

91
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,250
- ( all gasping )
- WHO IS THAT GUY?

92
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,500
- SAKAI?

93
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,625
- HOW CAN YOU BE SO
CASUAL ABOUT IT?

94
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,958
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT A PERSON.

95
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,375
I JUST DON'T GET IT.
YOU'RE HEARTLESS!

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,833
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
CALL HER NAMES

97
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,416
IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH HER.

98
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,833
IS THAT WHAT
HONOR STUDENTS DO?

99
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,958
YOU SEE, I THINK YELLING
AT A GIRL IS PRETTY OFFENSIVE.

100
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,666
- MM-HMM.

101
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,458
- MM.

102
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,958
- Shana: WHAT'S GOING ON?

103
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,916
THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
TO ME.

104
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,541
- COME ON, WHAT ARE
YOU GUYS DOING?

105
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,958
GET TO YOUR SEATS.

106
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,000
I'M TAKING ATTENDANCE NOW.

107
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,458
ABE.
- HERE!

108
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,083
- IKE. 
- HERE.

109
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,958
- ISHII.
- HERE.

110
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,000
- UEDA.
- HERE.

111
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,833
- UEHARA.
- HERE.

112
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,666
- OHBAYASHI.
- HERE.

113
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,583
- ( children playing )

114
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:24,875
- Yuji: IT'S NOT HER FAULT
THAT HIRAI DISAPPEARED.

115
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,166
AND THE ONLY REASON
SHE ASSUMED HIRAI'S IDENTITY

116
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,250
IS TO HELP FIGHT OUR ENEMY.
I GET THE FEELING

117
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:33,833
SHANA'S DONE THINGS
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

118
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:37,458
- ( screaming )

119
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,625
- IT'S LIKE SATO SAID.

120
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,583
IT'S JUST BECAUSE
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HER.

121
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,541
BUT I HAD TO SAY SOMETHING.

122
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:49,375
- ( book slams )
- MISS HIRAI!

123
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,500
EXPLAIN TO ME WHY YOU HAVEN'T
OPENED YOUR NOTEBOOK AND TEXT.

124
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,875
- ( all gasping )

125
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,750
- HIRAI!  ARE YOU LISTENING
TO ME, YOUNG LADY?

126
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,791
- Shana: HOW 'BOUT YOU LISTEN? 
- ( gasping )

127
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,916
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO FILL IN THE BLANK,

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,916
BUT YOU LEFT
THE WRONG PART EMPTY, SIR.

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
THIS ISN'T A GUESSING QUIZ.

130
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,125
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT
THE MISSING WORD

131
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,541
- FROM THE WORDS AROUND IT.
- ( gasping )

132
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,666
- THE CORRECT ANSWER IS,
"THAT WHICH WE CALL A ROSE

133
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,041
BY ANY OTHER NAME
WOULD SMELL AS SWEET."

134
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,041
BUT UNLESS WE'D MEMORIZED
THE ORIGINAL TEXT WORD FOR WORD,

135
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,375
THERE'S NO POSSIBLE WAY
WE COULD GET THAT.

136
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,291
AND LOOKING
AT THE WHOLE PARAGRAPH,

137
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,416
IT'S FAIRLY CLEAR
YOU'VE MISSED A COUPLE OF WORDS.

138
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,208
- HOW-- HOW DARE YOU?

139
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,041
- YOU'RE JUST NOT VERY GOOD
AT EXPLAINING.

140
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,916
YOU TALK AND TALK
AND YOU NEVER GET TO THE POINT.

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
- WHAT?!
- IF YOU WANNA TEACH ME THINGS,

142
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,583
I SUGGEST YOU STUDY
YOUR SUBJECT PROPERLY.

143
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:45,916
- AHH!
- Student: WHO IS SHE?

144
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,333
- THAT'S ONE CREEPY LITTLE GIRL!
OH!

145
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,333
- ARE YOU SERIOUS, HIRAI?

146
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,500
WHAT-- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
MY CHEMICAL FORMULA

147
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,291
HAS A FATAL FLAW IN IT?!

148
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,541
AAH!  THEY DON'T PAY ME ENOUGH
FOR THIS!

149
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,291
I'M OUTTA HERE!

150
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:08,083
- MY EXPLANATION SOUNDS
LIKE I'M TALKING IN MY SLEEP?!

151
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,500
- HAVE MERCY.

152
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:14,000
( crying )
THE APOCALYPSE IS UPON US.

153
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,291
GOOD-BYE, CRUEL WORLD!

154
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,083
- Girl: HEY, WAS HIRAI
ALWAYS LIKE THAT?

155
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:34,958
- Boy: I'M NOT SURE.
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN A BIT STRANGE.

156
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,625
- Girl: I COULD HARDLY BREATHE.

157
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,291
I'M NOT EVEN THAT NERVOUS
TAKING A TEST.

158
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,666
- Girl #2: AND REMEMBER WHEN
SAKAI BLEW UP AT HER EARLIER?

159
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,416
THAT WAS WILD.

160
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,333
- YEAH, FOR SUCH A SWEET GUY,
HE'S GOT A REAL TEMPER.

161
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,125
- THAT WAS SCARY.

162
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:58,916
- SAKAI, I'VE GOT A STUDENT
COUNCIL MEETING DURING LUNCH.

163
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,666
- UH, THAT'S OKAY.
I'LL JUST EAT ALONE.

164
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,250
- I'LL SMOOTH THINGS OVER
WITH EVERYONE LATER,

165
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,875
BUT YOU'VE GOTTA ADMIT,
YOU WERE ACTING PRETTY WEIRD.

166
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,750
- YEAH, I'M SORRY.

167
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,166
- LATER.

168
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,375
- I MESSED UP.

169
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,125
- MM, MMM MMM.

170
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,375
- Alastor: IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME

171
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,291
SINCE I'VE SEEN YOU
IN SUCH A GOOD MOOD.

172
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:33,333
- OH, THIS MELON BREAD.
THE CRUST IS JUST RIGHT.

173
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,833
COMPLEMENTS THE FILLING
JUST PERFECTLY.

174
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,916
- MMM...

175
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,083
- ( sighs )

176
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,625
IT'S JUST LIKE
ALL THE OTHER TORCHES.

177
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,250
THEY GET ANGRY
OVER THE MOST TRIVIAL THINGS.

178
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:53,250
THEY ALWAYS DO. NOTHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS ONE.

179
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,708
- HMM.

180
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,000
- WE'LL TAKE CARE
OF THAT CRIMSON DENIZEN,

181
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,958
THEN IT'S "GOOD-BYE, TORCH."

182
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:05,333
SAME AS ALWAYS.
- ( pops )

183
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:14,208
- Friagne: DO YOU REALLY
WANT TO GO, MARIANNE?

184
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:18,375
- YES.  PLEASE PERMIT ME
TO HUNT DOWN THE MYSTES FOR YOU.

185
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,250
I CAN'T LIVE KNOWING HOW BADLY
I FAILED YOU.

186
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:25,500
- IF THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT,
THEN REST EASY.

187
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:29,458
I'M NOT UPSET.
- BUT I HAVE TO.

188
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,375
MASTER, YOU ARE SO KIND.

189
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,541
BUT I CANNOT SIT IDLY BY.

190
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:38,375
PLEASE ACCEPT MY OFFER
TO HELP, ALONG WITH MY HEART.

191
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,375
- OH, MY DARLING, MARIANNE.

192
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,250
YOU ARE MUCH MORE
THAN I DESERVE.

193
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,291
I UNDERSTAND.  YOU MAY GO.
- I THANK YOU.

194
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,250
- BUT THERE IS THE MATTER
OF THAT FLAME HAZE

195
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,375
PROTECTING THE MYSTES.

196
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:55,166
TAKE THIS WITH YOU.

197
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:08,833
- RIGHT NOW I FEEL LIKE A TORCH
THAT'S ABOUT TO BURN OUT.

198
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:23,041
NOBODY WILL NOTICE
IF I JUST DISAPPEAR.

199
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,666
NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON
WILL REMEMBER

200
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,041
THAT I WAS EVER HERE.

201
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,291
AND THAT BOTHERS ME EVEN MORE

202
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,875
THAN KNOWING I'M GOING
TO VANISH FOREVER.

203
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,500
- Okada: PLEASE TELL ME,
WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU TEACHING

204
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,625
THOSE KIDS OF YOURS,
MR. OHMINE?

205
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:55,291
THAT STUDENT, YUKARI HIRAI,
IS NOTHING BUT A TROUBLEMAKER!

206
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,041
- Ohmine: SO I'VE HEARD.

207
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:00,916
I DON'T SEEM TO RECALL
THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS THIS WAY.

208
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,625
- YOUR STUDENTS DON'T HAVE
ANY RESPECT FOR YOU.

209
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,833
LET'S GIVE THEM A LESSON
IN DISCIPLINE,

210
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,291
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
- RIGHT.

211
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,458
- Girl: SHE DIDN'T LET UP
IN THE AFTERNOON CLASSES EITHER.

212
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,541
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HER PROBLEM IS.

213
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,000
- YUKARI?
SEE YA.

214
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,375
- HMM?
- SEE YA.

215
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:24,458
- YEAH, I HEARD YOU.
- HUH?  SORRY.

216
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,291
- ( sighs )

217
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,833
- SAKAI, I DON'T HAVE TO GO
TO PREP SCHOOL UNTIL LATER.

218
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,958
YOU WANNA HEAD OUT
AND GRAB A BITE?

219
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,458
- YOU TRYING TO CHEER ME UP?
- HUH?  NOT REALLY.

220
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,833
- ( voices echoing )

221
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,625
- THEY'RE HERE.
- HUH?

222
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,916
- IT'S HAPPENING
 ALL OVER AGAIN.

223
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,375
- THEY'VE SEALED IT.
- HOLD ON.  NOT AT SCHOOL.

224
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,125
- THE LOCATION
IS UNIMPORTANT TO THEM.

225
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,041
IT'S YOU THEY'RE AFTER.
- HUH?

226
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:05,000
- I THOUGHT
YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT.

227
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,625
- WAIT!
EVERYONE'S STILL HERE.

228
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,833
- THE ENEMY SEALED THIS SPOT.
TELL IT TO THEM.

229
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,125
- EVERYONE'S GOING
TO BE DRAWN INTO THIS

230
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,791
IF I DON'T DO SOMETHING.

231
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,250
AND IT'LL BE MY FAULT.

232
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,666
EXCUSE ME.

233
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,500
SHANA!

234
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,500
- DON'T BUG ME.
- I DON'T MEAN TO DISTRACT YOU,

235
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,333
BUT WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN IN HERE?

236
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,333
- THIS ISN'T ONE OF THE MORE
IMPRESSIVE MAGIC TRICKS.

237
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,666
( grunting )

238
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,625
( screaming )

239
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,291
- HUH?

240
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,250
HA!

241
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,041
IKE.

242
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,541
IS HE ALL RIGHT?

243
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,625
IKE!

244
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,291
- ( whimpering )

245
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,875
- HUH, YOU'RE THE SAME RINNE
AS BEFORE.

246
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,375
WHAT IS YOUR MASTER'S NAME?
- YOU THINK I'D TELL YOU?

247
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,000
- NO, BUT I THOUGHT
I'D CHECK FIRST.

248
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,625
I'D SAY FROM THE WAY HE KEEPS
WASTING THE LIKES OF YOU,

249
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,916
HE'S PROBABLY NOT THE SMARTEST
DENIZEN IN THE CRIMSON WORLD.

250
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,833
- HOW DARE YOU?

251
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:09,875
- HUH?

252
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,833
- ( squeals )

253
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:24,166
- HELLO THERE, LITTLE ONE.

254
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,708
I FELT IT WAS TIME
YOU AND I MET.

255
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:31,250
- HE MUST BE ONE OF THEM.
A CRIMSON DENIZEN.

256
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,750
- WELL DONE.
REALLY QUITE IMPRESSIVE

257
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,291
THE WAY YOU REDUCED
MY "REGULAR SHARP" TREASURE

258
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,958
WITH NOTHING
BUT A SINGLE SWORD.

259
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,500
- MASTER, I'M VERY SORRY.

260
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,583
- NO NEED FOR APOLOGIES,
MARIANNE.

261
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:49,875
IT'S MY FAULT FOR GIVING YOU
AN UNFAMILIAR TREASURE.

262
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,375
- AH!

263
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,333
- SO YOU'RE THE MASTER.

264
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,916
- YES.  HUNTER FRIAGNE.
THAT IS WHAT I'M CALLED.

265
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,333
- HUNTER?
YOU'RE A FLAME HAZE KILLER.

266
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:04,291
- I DON'T LIKE BEING REFERRED TO
IN THAT WAY.

267
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:07,541
I SEE MYSELF AS MORE
OF A COLLECTOR OF TREASURES,

268
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,291
THOSE ARE WHAT I HUNT.

269
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,875
YOU MUST BE ALASTOR,
THE FLAME OF THE HEAVENS.

270
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,041
YOU'RE WELL-KNOWN
IN THE CRIMSON WORLD.

271
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:19,916
WE'VE NEVER MET, THOUGH I'D
HEARD YOU WERE ON THIS SIDE.

272
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,041
- Alastor: DON'T LET
HIS APPEARANCE FOOL YOU.

273
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,958
HE IS A POWERFUL LORD
OF THE CRIMSON WORLD.

274
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,500
HE COMMANDS NUMEROUS TREASURES

275
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,541
AND HAS OVERCOME
MANY A FLAME HAZE.

276
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,833
- SO THIS IS YOUR PARTNER?

277
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:36,250
THE NIETONO NO SHANA
FLAME HAZE.

278
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,000
SHE'S AS PRETTY AS THE RUMORS
LED ME TO BELIEVE.

279
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,833
ALTHOUGH I HEAR SHE HAS TROUBLE
PRODUCING HER OWN FLAMES.

280
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,000
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

281
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,583
- I BELIEVE YOU ARE
MERELY RELYING

282
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,000
ON THE POWER OF THAT
SWORD TO CALL FORTH

283
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,333
THE FLAMES WITHIN YOU.

284
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,125
AM I WRONG?

285
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,791
FLAME OF THE HEAVENS,

286
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,083
BY BINDING SOMEONE
AS WEAK AS HER TO YOU,

287
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:59,125
YOUR POWERS AS A CRIMSON LORD
ARE BEING SQUANDERED.

288
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,000
- YEAH?  WANNA TEST ME
AND SEE IF THAT'S THE CASE?

289
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,333
- I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE.

290
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,208
A FLAME HAZE GETS ANGRY,
ATTACKS RECKLESSLY,

291
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,250
AND DIES
IN THE EXPLOSION.

292
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,166
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T ALLOW THAT

293
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,250
BECAUSE I CAN'T RISK DAMAGING
THAT VALUABLE MYSTES THERE.

294
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:19,625
- ( gasps )
- I'LL BE BACK ANOTHER TIME.

295
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:23,000
I DO WONDER
WHAT'S INSIDE IT.

296
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,083
WE'LL SOON SEE.

297
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,250
- Alastor: THIS IS A DENIZEN
WE SHOULD NOT TREAT LIGHTLY.

298
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,666
- I NEED TO FIX EVERYTHING
THAT'S BROKEN HERE.

299
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,083
MOVE OVER. I'LL USE THAT GUY.
- HMM, COME AGAIN?

300
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,416
- I'M GOING TO USE
THE POWER OF HIS EXISTENCE

301
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,083
TO FIX THE DAMAGE
TO THIS PLACE.

302
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,916
IKE!
YOU'RE GOING TO USE IKE?

303
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,208
- THAT'S RIGHT.

304
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,791
USUALLY THERE ARE SEVERAL
TORCHES LEFT BEHIND,

305
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,583
BUT IN THIS CASE WE'LL HAVE
TO USE SOMEONE WHO IS DYING.

306
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,875
A HUMAN BEING, EVEN ONE THAT'S
DYING, IS MORE THAN ENOUGH.

307
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,083
WE'LL JUST REPLACE HIM
WITH A TORCH

308
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,291
AND THEN
THERE'LL BE NO PROBLEM.

309
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,958
- STOP RIGHT THERE!

310
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,916
YOU'RE SAYING
IKE'S GOING TO DIE LIKE ME?

311
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,625
- I'VE GOT NO CHOICE.

312
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:12,708
I NEED TO HAVE SOME POWER
TO FIX EVERYTHING HERE.

313
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,041
OKAY, WE CAN ALWAYS
USE SOMEONE ELSE.

314
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,791
HOW ABOUT HIM?

315
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:21,125
- STOP IT. YOU CAN'T USE
ANYONE WHO'S STILL ALIVE.

316
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,291
- THEN WHAT DO YOU
SUGGEST WE DO?

317
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,916
IF WE RELEASE THE SEAL
IN THIS STATE,

318
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,250
THERE'LL BE
COMPLETE CHAOS.

319
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,375
HE'S GOING TO DIE ANYWAY.

320
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:33,125
- BUT IT'S NOT FAIR.
I CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN.

321
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:37,250
- WELL, DO YOU
WANNA USE YOURSELF?

322
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:41,458
THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH FLAME
LEFT IN YOU TO FIX ALL OF THIS.

323
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,833
BUT THAT MEANS YOU'RE ONLY GONNA
BURN OUT THAT MUCH QUICKER.

324
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,000
THERE'S NO WAY
HE'S GONNA DO IT.

325
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,958
HE'S JUST LIKE
ANY OTHER TORCH.

326
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,125
THEY'RE DESPERATE TO HANG ON
TO WHAT LITTLE EXISTENCE

327
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,416
THEY HAVE LEFT.

328
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,458
- Yuji: YOU'RE RIGHT.
THAT IS AN OPTION.

329
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:02,958
MY EXISTENCE WILL BE USED
TO HELP IKE AND THE OTHERS.

330
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:06,333
THAT'LL BE PROOF
THAT I WAS HERE.

331
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,791
- HMM.

332
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,875
- SO STRANGE.

333
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,083
NO, PECULIAR.
NO, SICKENING.

334
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,125
YES.
HE'S SICKENING.

335
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,083
- Alastor:
BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP YOU

336
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,625
FROM USING YOUR POWERS. 
- WHAT ELSE COULD I DO?

337
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:24,666
HE ACTUALLY OFFERED
TO LET ME USE HIS EXISTENCE.

338
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:29,083
HE'S LUCKY I DIDN'T USE UP
ALL OF HIS FLAME.

339
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,083
HUH?
- HEY THERE.

340
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,583
I KNEW YOU'D BE UP HERE.
- AREN'T YOU SMART?

341
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,291
- Alastor: HOW DID YOU
KNOW WE WERE HERE?

342
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,750
- I FELT SOMETHING,

343
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:41,000
KINDA LIKE THAT SEALED ZONE
TODAY, BUT A LOT SMALLER.

344
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,166
- REALLY? I SUPPOSE YOU'RE
BEGINNING TO DEVELOP A FEELING

345
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,166
FOR THE POWER
AFTER REPEATED EXPOSURE TO IT.

346
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,125
- SAY, I'VE BEEN WONDERING,

347
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:52,041
IS THAT THING
LIKE A TRANSMITTER?

348
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,375
- HMM.
- SIMILAR, BUT DIFFERENT.

349
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,583
THIS IS CALLED THE COCYTUS.

350
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,791
IT ACTS AS A MIRROR
FOR MY CONSCIOUSNESS,

351
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,375
WHICH IS PRESENTLY RESIDING
WITHIN THIS GIRL.

352
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:04,958
- OKAY.
I THINK I UNDERSTAND.

353
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,708
- GREAT.  HAPPY NOW?

354
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:10,375
- UH, NO.  I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THANKS AND APOLOGIZE.

355
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:13,666
- THANKS AND APOLOGIZE?
WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THAT?

356
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,500
- I'M REALLY SORRY
FOR YELLING AT YOU ABOUT HIRAI.

357
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,375
AND THANK YOU
FOR NOT USING IKE.

358
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:21,625
- HUH? I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS

359
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,958
BECAUSE I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
YOU YELLING AT ME.

360
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,000
AND ALL I DID
WAS USE YOUR EXISTENCE

361
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,625
INSTEAD OF
YOUR FRIEND'S EXISTENCE.

362
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,333
SO YOUR FLAME
IS MUCH SMALLER NOW.

363
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,375
IT COULD GO OUT AT ANY TIME.

364
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,500
- YES, BUT IT'S STILL BETTER
THAN WAITING

365
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,041
FOR THE END TO COME
AND THEN BEING FORGOTTEN.

366
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,166
I THINK MY EXISTENCE,
MY MEMORY,

367
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,000
IS A PART
OF IKE AND THE OTHERS NOW.

368
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:47,041
- BUT IT'S NO DIFFERENT
FROM ANY OTHER MEMORY.

369
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:50,875
IT'LL JUST GET BURIED UNDER
ALL THE EVENTS THAT ARE TO COME.

370
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:54,541
- BUT IT'LL BE THERE.
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

371
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,291
HERE, THIS IS FOR YOU.

372
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,041
- IT'S BITTER!

373
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,875
- OH, BUT I ADDED SUGAR.

374
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,916
- SPOON!
- OH, I FORGOT.

375
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,291
I'LL GO GET ONE.

376
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:14,333
- DAMN IT.
WHY DOES HE BUG ME SO MUCH?

377
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,625
HMM?

378
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,125
DID YOU SEE THAT?

379
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,125
- HMM. I THINK I KNOW
WHAT THE TREASURE

380
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,958
INSIDE THIS MYSTES
MIGHT BE.

381
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,666
- Yuji: I KNEW NOTHING
AT THE TIME.

382
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,208
I HAD NO IDEA
WHAT WAS INSIDE ME.

383
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:36,291
AND I CERTAINLY DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THE PEOPLE

384
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,750
WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED
IN MISAKI.

385
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,958
- Margery: HA!  DULLSVILLE.

386
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,583
- ( Marco laughing )
YOU SAID THE SAME THING

387
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:52,250
ABOUT ALL THOSE
EUROPEAN TOWNS TOO.

388
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:55,166
MAYBE DULL IS ONLY IN THE EYE
OF THE BEHOLDER,

389
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,833
MY DEARLY BELOVED GOBLET,
MARGERY DAW!

390
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:00,875
( laughing, grunting ) 
- STAY FOCUSED.

391
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:03,541
WE KNOW FOR A FACT
THIS IS WHERE HE RAN TO.

392
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,666
AND I'M PICKING UP
OTHER SCENTS AS WELL.

393
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,875
- YES, SOMETHING DOES SMELL.

394
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:11,500
AND IT'S YOUR BREATH,
YOU BOOZEHOUND! ( laughing )

395
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:14,458
- OW!
- QUIET, STUPID MARCO.

396
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:19,375
I THINK THIS COULD BECOME
VERY INTERESTING INDEED.

397
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:23,750
- HA.  WE HAVE PESTS.

398
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:29,041
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

399
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,375
- Yuji: IMPATIENT, HESITANT,

400
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:02,125
SHANA BEGINS
TO QUESTION HER FEELINGS.

401
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,000
BEFORE A RESOLUTION
CAN BE REACHED,

402
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:06,958
A BATTLE
BETWEEN FLAME HAZES BREAKS OUT.

403
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:08,166
NEXT EPISODE...
