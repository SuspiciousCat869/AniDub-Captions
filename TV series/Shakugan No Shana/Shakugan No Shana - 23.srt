1
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,791
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,500
LIVES CONSUMED IN

3
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,458
SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.
NO ONE CAN TELL WHEN

4
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,500
THE WORLD IS DISPLACED,
AND THE FLAMES OF THE

5
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:45,375
CRIMSON WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

6
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,333
- ( theme song playing )

7
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

8
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:17,958
- Wirhelmina:
ONCE WE STORM IN THERE,

9
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,166
THERE WILL INDEED BE
NO TURNING BACK.

10
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,333
- I KNOW.
- AND OUR OBJECTIVE?

11
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:23,791
- Shana: THE ONLY
THING I'M CERTAIN OF

12
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,208
IS THAT I HAVE TO GO IN THERE.

13
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,916
- Wirhelmina: I UNDERSTAND.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,750
IF WE GO, I'M SURE THE ANSWER
WILL BECOME CLEAR,

15
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,375
- BECAUSE YOU ARE A FLAME HAZE.
- YEAH.

16
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:34,750
- Tiamat: ENTER.

17
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,458
- SHANA.

18
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:47,208
SHE PROTECTED ME, EVEN THOUGH
I'M NOTHING BUT A MYSTES.

19
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,750
WHY?

20
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,875
- Shana: YUJI, I CAN FEEL YOU.

21
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,208
- THEY HAVE NOT SET UP
A PROTECTIVE SEAL.

22
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,125
- Alastor: YES,
BUT NOT SURPRISING,

23
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,583
CONSIDERING THEY KNEW WE
WERE GOING TO BE COMING.

24
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,791
- Tiamat: STAY FOCUSED.
- RIGHT.

25
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:17,541
- FLAME HAZES.
- HUH! SHANA.

26
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,208
- Wirhelmina: INDEED, I EXPECTED
TO SEE MORE DENIZENS

27
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,750
ROAMING THE PALACE OF THE STARS.

28
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,833
- IT'S TOO QUIET
AND THERE AREN'T ANY RINNE.

29
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,708
- I SENSE SOMETHING OVER THERE.

30
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:51,208
A VAST AMOUNT OF POWER OF
EXISTENCE IS POURING FORTH.

31
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,958
- THAT'S WHERE YUJI IS.
- Alastor: HMM.

32
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,375
- Wirhelmina: THEY'RE NOT EVEN
TRYING TO HIDE THE WHEREABOUTS

33
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,166
OF THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

34
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,666
- Tiamat: A TRAP.

35
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,208
- Alastor: BUT, WE DON'T HAVE
THE LUXURY OF WORKING OUT

36
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,458
A PERFECT PLAN TO COUNTER
EVERY SITUATION.

37
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,125
- THEN YOUR NAME IS SHANA.

38
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,541
- LET'S GO.

39
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,083
- INDEED, THE MISSION
WILL BE A SUCCESS

40
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:26,625
IF EVEN ONE OF US GETS THROUGH
TO THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

41
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,708
- GO FORWARD AND
HOLD NOTHING BACK.

42
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:29,833
- MMM.

43
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,541
- WHAT? WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER?

44
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,000
- Tiamat: TIME IS RUNNING OUT.

45
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,250
- Tanaka: SHE'S GOING UP
AGAINST THAT HUGE THING?

46
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,208
IS HIRAI GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

47
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,916
- Sato: WAIT, LOOK THERE.

48
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,208
THAT CASTLE HAS UNRESTRICTED
SYSTEM THINGS MOVING ALL OVER IT

49
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,041
- Professor: LOOK, THEY'RE HERE,
THE UNENLIGHTENED BRIGANDS

50
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:41,416
WHO WOULD OBSTRUCT
MY EXPERIMENT.

51
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,708
- DOMINO.

52
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:47,833
- I'M HERE. ALL THE
PREPARATIONS ARE COMPLETE.

53
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:52,625
- ( laughs ) WE'LL EXPERIMENT ON
THE EXPERIMENT OBSTRUCTORS.

54
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,208
THEY'LL PLAY A KEY ROLE
FOR THE THEME

55
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,666
OF MY WHOLE SACRED CHAPEL IS,

56
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,083
ECOLOGIZING AND RECYCLYZING.

57
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,750
- SOMETHING'S HERE.
- A DENIZEN.

58
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,166
- NO.

59
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:49,875
- ( creaking )

60
00:07:56,083 --> 00:08:00,125
- Robots: LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT,
RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT...

61
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,208
- ( chanting )

62
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:13,958
- Domino: HALT.

63
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,250
- THESE GUYS.
- INDEED THESE ARE RINNE.

64
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,875
- Tiamat: AUTOMATONS.

65
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,708
- Alastor: THE SEEKER'S DOING.

66
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,208
- CHARGE.

67
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,500
- WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

68
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,666
MY POWER OF EXISTENCE
HAS BEEN DRAINED.

69
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,291
- Wirhelmina: THIS MACHINE...

70
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:04,000
- Professor: IT'S A SUCCESS.
OH, THE UNRESTRICTED METHOD

71
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,833
DRAINS EXISTENCE
FROM TRESPASSERS

72
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,875
IN ORDER TO POWER MY RINNE.

73
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:12,583
IT'S FUNCTIONING EXCELLENTLY.

74
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:16,625
- Domino: YES, SIR, PROFESSOR.
WE'LL CONTINUE THE ATTACK.

75
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,375
- ( grunts )

76
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,416
- ( sighs )

77
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,083
- Alastor: HMM. CURSED SEEKER.
HOW OBSTRUCTIVE.

78
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,958
THAT'S WHY IT WAS SO EASY
TO GAIN ENTRANCE.

79
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,083
- HOW COME THEY'RE STILL MOVING?

80
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,791
- HE'S LIKELY EQUIPPED THEM
WITH SOME SPECIAL DEVICE

81
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,958
THAT EMPOWERS THEM.

82
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,833
- Wirhelmina: INDEED,
HERE THEY COME.

83
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,750
- ( grunting )

84
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,875
- THE NIETONO NO
SHANA IS HEAVY.

85
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,625
- Alastor: THE ONLY THINGS YOU
CAN COUNT ON ARE

86
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,833
THE PHYSICAL TECHNIQUES
YOU'VE LEARNED.

87
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,250
- REMEMBER THE LESSONS FROM
THE PALACE OF HEAVEN'S ROAD.

88
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,375
- RIGHT.

89
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:20,750
- ( grunts )

90
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:29,125
- WE'VE COME TOO FAR
TO TURN BACK. OUR ONLY...

91
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,583
CHANCE IS TO FIND
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

92
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,666
- ( grunts )

93
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,500
INDEED HOW IRONIC, THERE'S
AN ENDLESS SUPPLY

94
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,791
OF POWER OF EXISTENCE OUTSIDE.

95
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:00,250
- SHANA. SHE'S FIGHTING.

96
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,666
- Hecate: FIGHTING.

97
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,375
- Yuji: POWER OF EXISTENCE
IS FLOWING INTO THE CITY,

98
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,916
BECAUSE OF
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

99
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
IT'S TRUE. IF I WANT TO
PROTECT THE CITY,

100
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,333
THEN MAYBE THIS IS FOR THE BEST.

101
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,416
- FOR THE BEST.

102
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,625
- Yuji: WHY?
- I'M NOTHING BUT A MYSTES.

103
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:27,166
- Yuji: HUH? STOP IT. WHY DO
YOU HAVE TO LOOK INSIDE ME?

104
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,291
- YOU'RE WRONG. YOU ARE
THE ONE WHO IS ENTERING ME.

105
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,250
YOUR THOUGHTS ARE FULFILLING ME.

106
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:39,958
I HAVE PRAYED FOR THIS MOMENT,
SEARCHED FOR AN ANSWER,

107
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,416
AND NOW IT IS HERE.

108
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,750
THAT'S WHY I WANT
MORE OF WHO YOU ARE.

109
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,083
- YOU'RE TAKING MY...

110
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,041
- YUJI.

111
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,125
- Bel Peol: WELL, I WONDER
HOW LONG THEY'RE GONNA LAST.

112
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,458
CARE TO MAKE A LITTLE WAGER.

113
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,250
- HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN, BEL PEOL,

114
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,291
WE'RE FIGHTING THE
FLAME OF HEAVEN

115
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,708
AND THE TIARA OF DREAMS
AND ILLUSIONS.

116
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,833
- BUT THE FLAME HAZES
THEY'RE USING HAVE BEEN

117
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,791
DENIED ACCESS TO
POWER OF EXISTENCE,

118
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,875
MAKING THEM NO DIFFERENT
THAN YOUR AVERAGE HUMAN.

119
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,750
BESIDES, WE'VE ALREADY
COMPLETED THE SACRED CHAPEL.

120
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,833
WE'LL BE COLLECTING POWER
OF EXISTENCE FOREVER NOW.

121
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,333
- ( both panting )

122
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:50,125
- READY, READY GO AND AIM.

123
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,541
- ( grunts )

124
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,500
- Tanaka: SO, SHE'S FIGHTING
IN THERE, RIGHT NOW?

125
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,666
- Sato: PROBABLY.
COME ON, HIRAI.

126
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,416
- WHAT THE...

127
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,083
- WARNING, THE
POWER OF EXISTENCE

128
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,708
HAS REACHED SATURATION POINT.

129
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,458
- ( screams )

130
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,208
- INDEED, THEY ARE ENDLESS.

131
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,333
- WAS THAT A PART
OF HIS CALCULATIONS?

132
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,916
- WHO KNOWS?

133
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,375
I GET THE FEELING WE'RE
IN UNKNOWN TERRITORY HERE.

134
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,833
- Professor: HOW EXCITING. WE'VE
NEVER SEEN THE LIKE BEFORE,

135
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:41,833
A WORLD FILLED TO THE BRIM
WITH POWER OF EXISTENCE.

136
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,166
- ( laughs )

137
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,291
- UH, PROFESSOR,
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NEXT?

138
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,791
- I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S WHY
WE DO THESE EXPERIMENTS

139
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:54,250
IN ORDER TO FIND OUT
THE REAL TRUTH, THE REAL LAWS,

140
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,333
AND THE REAL STATE OF THE WORLD.

141
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,416
- SAKAI, YUKARI.

142
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,750
- ( screams )

143
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,458
- Sato: ALL RIGHT, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOIN' ON,

144
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:12,333
BUT I DO KNOW WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

145
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,291
- YEAH AND SO IS THE CITY.

146
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,208
- ( both sigh )

147
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:24,208
- Margery: HEY, GUYS.
ARE YOU THERE?

148
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,500
- HUH?
- KEISAKU, EITA.

149
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,166
YOU GUYS AREN'T DEAD, ARE YA?

150
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,083
- HELLO, IS ANYONE THERE?
KEISAKU, EITA.

151
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,166
- I... WE... YOU...
- ANSWER ME, RIGHT NOW.

152
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,666
- BIG SISTER.
- HMM.

153
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:36,916
- Tanaka: BIG SISTER.

154
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,916
- Marco: ( laughs ) GLAD TO HEAR
YOU TWO ARE STILL ALIVE.

155
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,583
- Tanaka: YOU DECIDED
TO COME BACK

156
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,333
- Margery: AH, IT'S
THE DUTY OF A FLAME HAZE.

157
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:49,875
- Marco: OH, AS IF. YOU WENT
ALL PALE AND THEN RUSHED, OW.

158
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,500
- ANYWAY, I NEED YOU TO GET
TO THE CRYSTAL ALTAR,

159
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,125
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANNA CHECK.

160
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,958
- Tanaka: ALL READY THERE.
I JUST THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

161
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,500
- LISTEN, WE'VE BEEN WAITING
AT THE CRYSTAL ALTAR FOR YOU,

162
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:02,083
NOW HURRY UP AND TELL US
WHAT TO LOOK FOR.

163
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:06,000
- Marco: ( laughs )
THAT'S THE WAY TO TELL HER.

164
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:10,291
- HA, ALL RIGHT, I'LL PRETEND I
DIDN'T JUST HEAR YOU SNAP AT ME.

165
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,208
- TAKE A LOOK AT
THE PALACE OF STARS.

166
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,666
- Tanaka: PALACE OF STARS?

167
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,208
- Margery: THE HUGE CASTLE
FLOATING IN THE SKY...

168
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:19,208
I'M PRETTY SURE THE LITTLE BRAT
WENT IN THERE, BUT THERE'S THIS

169
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,125
STRANGE UNRESTRICTED
METHOD AROUND IT.

170
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,083
- Tanaka: UH, YEAH,
THAT'S RIGHT.

171
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,375
- Margery: TRACE IT BACK TO
FIND OUT WHAT PART OF THE

172
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,708
CASTLE IT'S COMING
FROM AND HURRY.

173
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,916
- RIGHT. WILL DO.

174
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,291
- Marco:
THEY'RE PRETTY RELIABLE,

175
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,666
A RESULT OF YOUR
INFLUENCE I'D SAY.

176
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,083
- GUESS SO.

177
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:40,666
-SATO, SHE CAME BACK.
BIG SISTER ACTUALLY CAME BACK.

178
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,875
- YEAH, SHE SURE DID.

179
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,333
SHE JUST COMES AND GOES.

180
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,500
RIGHT THERE.

181
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,916
- Margery: PLAY ONE
MORE PRETTY MELODY.

182
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,958
- Marco: HEY, PLAY ONE MORE
PRETTY MELODY.

183
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:12,333
- PLEASE, DEAR, WILL YOU
PLAY ONE FOR ME?

184
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,250
- Marco: HEY, PLAY ONE MORE
PRETTY MELODY.

185
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:19,875
- ( grunts )

186
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,666
- Both: GOODBYE AND GOODNIGHT.

187
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:32,958
- ( screams ) WHY HAS MY
MACHINE STOPPED FUNCTIONING?

188
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,166
- Domino: UH, THE DEVICE
THAT POWERS OUR

189
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,166
SPECIAL UNRESTRICTED METHOD...

190
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,958
IT APPEARS TO BE BROKEN.

191
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,250
- THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

192
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,916
- ( speaks incoherently )

193
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,458
- Sydonay: IT SEEMS THE CHANTER
OF ELEGIES HAS RETURNED.

194
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,791
- OH WELL, WHY DO FLAME HAZES

195
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:01,708
HAVE A TENDENCY TO SMASH ANY NEW
EXPERIMENTS THEY ENCOUNTER?

196
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,750
- IF SHE'S COME THIS FAR,
THEN PRETTY SOON,

197
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,000
SHE'S GONNA BE A
DISTRACTION TO HECATE.

198
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,541
I THINK I'LL GO AND GREET HER.

199
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,083
- THEN I GUESS I'LL
HAVE TO GO SAY HELLO

200
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,625
TO OUR FIRST TWO GUESTS.

201
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,791
- INDEED, IT APPEARS
WE HAVE BEEN SAVED

202
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,625
BY THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

203
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:21,708
- Shana: YEAH.

204
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,541
SHE'S HERE.

205
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,875
- THIS ENERGY...
JUDGE OF PARADOXES.

206
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:42,416
- HELLO THERE, BEEN A WHILE
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

207
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,083
- I PREFER THAT YOU
NOT GET IN OUR WAY.

208
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,083
- Marco: CAN'T AGREE TO THAT,

209
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,625
NOT AFTER ALL THE WEIRD THINGS
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN DOING.

210
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,833
- Margery: TODAY ISN'T A DAY
FOR BACKING DOWN.

211
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,333
WE'RE SWIMMING
IN POWER RIGHT NOW.

212
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,958
WHY DON'T WE MAKE THIS
A FIGHT TO REMEMBER?

213
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,375
- ALL RIGHT THEN, LET'S
END THIS BEFORE WE GROW

214
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,833
TOO FOND OF EACH OTHER.

215
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,125
- ( both growling )

216
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:13,666
- YOU SHOULD GO ON. WE'LL BE OK
AS LONG AS ONE OF US MAKES IT.

217
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,541
- I HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR ANSWER IS BY NOW.

218
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,291
- AND WILL YOU
INDEED DESTROY IT?

219
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,791
- I WON'T DO IT.

220
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,708
- THEN YOU'RE WILLING TO HAVE
THE WORLD THROWN OUT OF BALANCE?

221
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,333
- I WON'T LET IT.

222
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:34,833
WIRHELMINA, I AM THE FLAMING-
HAIRED BLAZING-EYED HUNTER,

223
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,333
BUT I AM ALSO SHANA.

224
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:42,208
MY MISSION IS CLEAR, BUT I WILL
NOT DESTROY THE MYSTES, YUJI.

225
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,708
THEY ARE THE SAME, AND
WITHOUT HIM, I AM NOT ME.

226
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,500
I AM NOT ONLY A FLAME HAZE.

227
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,208
I AM SHANA, WITH THE FLAMING
HAIR AND BLAZING EYES,

228
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,375
AND I FIGHT FOR MY BELIEFS.
THAT IS MY ANSWER.

229
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,083
- THEN GO ON AHEAD.

230
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,375
IF YOU'VE MADE YOUR DECISION,

231
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,666
I INDEED HAVE NOTHING
MORE TO SAY TO YOU.

232
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,000
- WIRHELMINA.
- I'VE FAITH IN YOU

233
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:20,041
WITHOUT RESERVATION OR DOUBT,
I DO INDEED BELIEVE IN YOU.

234
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,750
- THEN WE'RE OFF.
WE SHALL MEET AGAIN,

235
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:26,333
SPECIALIST OF EVERYTHING,
TIARA OF DREAMS AND ILLUSIONS.

236
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,875
- OH, HOW SAD TO SEE YOU
RUNNING AWAY FROM ME.

237
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,416
- INDEED, I AM
TO BE YOUR OPPONENT.

238
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,666
- Tiamat: COMMENCE BATTLE.

239
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,958
- LOVELY. YOU AND I
ARE GONNA HAVE SOME FUN.

240
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,791
- ALASTOR, YOU ASKED ME
WHAT I WANTED TO DO WITH YUJI

241
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,291
OR MORE LIKE WHAT
I WANTED HIM TO DO.

242
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:02,750
- I STILL DON'T KNOW YET.
- I SEE.

243
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:06,750
- AND YET I LOVE YUJI.

244
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,333
- THAT'S ALL I DO KNOW.
- HMM.

245
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:13,875
- YES, THAT'S ENOUGH.
I CAN FIGHT WITH JUST THAT.

246
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:18,333
- Yuji: THEN YOUR NAME IS SHANA.
THAT'S WHAT I'LL CALL YOU.

247
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:22,000
STOP SAYING YOU'RE ONLY
A FLAME HAZE.

248
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:26,000
- Hecate: SHANA, FLAMING-HAIRED
BLAZING-EYED FLAME HAZE.

249
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:29,458
- Yuji: YES. I GAVE
HER THAT NAME.

250
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:33,500
SINCE THEN, THE BLAZING-EYED
HUNTER HAS BEEN CALLED SHANA.

251
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:37,250
- YUJI.

252
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:42,625
- NOW I SEE. SHE PROTECTED
ME, BECAUSE SHE'S SHANA.

253
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,041
- Hecate: BECAUSE SHE'S SHANA.

254
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:48,500
- RIGHT, SHE'S NOT JUST
A FLAME HAZE. BUT I WAS...

255
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:58,125
- I WAS THE ONE WHO
ONLY SAW HER AS A FLAME HAZE.

256
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:00,458
IT WAS ME.

257
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,750
- YUJI.
- SHANA.

258
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:18,875
- AN OBSTACLE.

259
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,541
- YUJI, I AM COMING FOR YOU.

260
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,958
- ( theme song playing )

261
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:30,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

262
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:02,208
- Yuji: SHAKUGAN NO SHANA,
FINAL EPISODE,

263
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:04,625
"CRIMSON THOUGHTS."

264
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:09,000
AT THAT MOMENT, A SMILE FROM THE
GIRL STEPPING INTO THE FLAMES.
