1
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:24,000
Bomb Tokyo. It's the only way.

2
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:27,625
Huh? Are you serious
or just jerkin' my chain?

3
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,791
It's the only way outta this.

4
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,333
Those things are choking
the city to death right now.

5
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,541
If we don't wipe
'em out, they're gonna do

6
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,708
the same thing
to the entire country.

7
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:40,041
Whoa. You are serious,
but it's crazy.

8
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,083
No deal.

9
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,291
Why?

10
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,541
I'm guessing you're
not good with numbers,

11
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,000
or you probably would've
realized to pull it off

12
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,500
you'd need pockets deep
as most national treasuries.

13
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:54,583
Say what?

14
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:55,916
Unless you want
those things eating up

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,916
your little kingdom here,
you'd better get out

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,333
that pocketbook and
start makin' it rain.

17
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,500
Listen, in case you haven't
noticed, I run a business,

18
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:05,125
not a bank, and
definitely not a charity.

19
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:06,833
Well...

20
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:09,916
I suppose...

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,458
You could rent it.
If you can't afford to buy.

22
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:45,833
Rent an air force?

23
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,958
Yeah. With the
global economy on the skids

24
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,333
like it is these days,

25
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,333
countries'd do
anything for a buck.

26
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,083
But can you actually do that?

27
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,500
Money's always talked.

28
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,291
But right now it's way
louder than it's ever been.

29
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,833
Normally, I never
play the role of

30
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:03,541
a third party broker,
but these are strange times.

31
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,291
And if I do this,
it's on my terms.

32
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,416
The date and precise
time of your little bombing raid

33
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,333
will have to be
given to me in advance.

34
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,083
Yeah, of course.
No problem at all.

35
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,250
What's more. I need that.

36
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,958
Throw in the dagger
and we have ourselves a deal.

37
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,208
This thing? But why?

38
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,875
I've always had an
eye for stuff of value,

39
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,250
and that knife in
particular is calling my name.

40
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,541
As far as this
deal's concerned...

41
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,333
If you let me
have the pig-sticker,

42
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,250
I'll cover the cost for
one of the bombers in return.

43
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,833
It's all yours.

44
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,500
Superb!

45
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,291
You sure about that?

46
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,541
It's just an item.
The lives we'll save are worth

47
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,333
a lot more than
anything I've got.

48
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,291
I know. But Nagiko
gave it to you.

49
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,833
It's mine, but it's not a part
of me. I'm the same without it.

50
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,000
It's like an accessory, right?

51
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,708
I trust that you
can get this done?

52
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:05,000
I can. And I'll contact
you when it's all ready.

53
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:08,916
Wait!

54
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,375
What?

55
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,291
That earring you've got.

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,666
What about it?

57
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,833
Let me guess? Is it
"calling your name" too?

58
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,541
Oh that thing?
No, not my style.

59
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:27,458
No? Well.
Move your buns, hon.

60
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,791
It's alright sugar britches.

61
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:34,833
Miss Momo, can take all
night getting what she wants.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,666
Chop chop, hon.

63
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,041
Afternoon my mistress.
Welcome home!

64
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,500
Tack-ky.

65
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,250
Not my idea, trust me.

66
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:01,583
Hark! Karin? Dost
thou bring visitors?

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,041
It's her. From that night!

68
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,125
You sadist!

69
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,666
Tranny!

70
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,041
Truly? These are more "trannies"
whose acquaintance we make?

71
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,625
No, I was born a girl!

72
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,166
What is your business here?

73
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,458
We should be asking you
that! There's a lot of freaks

74
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,333
in this part of town, but no
one wants what you're selling!

75
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,000
Hey, that little girl,
who is she?

76
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:28,333
Miss Mikuni.
She's like, uh, like,

77
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,166
let's just say
an Atlas super VIP.

78
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,625
Seriously? Oh-kay.

79
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,875
Karin! Why have you
sullied my lady's chamber

80
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,416
 with this human garbage?

81
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,458
You're one to talk,
lady. Of course.

82
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,291
This woman has an item
that I thought would be

83
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,875
of interest to Miss Mikuni.

84
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,666
Then bring it hence.

85
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,500
The match!

86
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,958
No milady!

87
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:07,333
Behold! These would seem
to be two of a perfect pair.

88
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:13,250
Yeah, they are. That's crazy.

89
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:16,375
This earring is the one memento
we have to remember our mother.

90
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,416
Whoa! That was your mother's?

91
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,000
Hmmm. Hardly cause for torture.

92
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,791
Explain this! Wherefore
does one of thy humble station

93
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,833
come to possess our
dear mother's keepsake?

94
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:30,166
Hold on a second!
If that belonged to her mom,

95
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,041
could you be... her dad?!

96
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,416
Oh, come on! Even if I may
have had the proper tools

97
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,791
at one time,
I never used them for that!

98
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,791
Shocking, but women
aren't my thing.

99
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,291
I know, but--

100
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,625
To be perfectly honest, Nagiko's
the one who gave it to me.

101
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,458
So it was Grandma's?

102
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,666
Yeah. She didn't tell me much.

103
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,958
But she did mention that it was

104
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,333
something that used
to belong to your mother.

105
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,958
No way. If that's true,

106
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:10,375
then I guess this
girl and I are sisters.

107
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,916
You suggest garbage like you

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,541
and Lady Mikuni
could be related?

109
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,375
It's simply unacceptable!

110
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,458
Could'st thou be our sister?

111
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,666
Come on, Momoko. Clue me in.

112
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,625
I'm just as lost.

113
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:28,416
"Momoko". "Tranny".
Thou be'est by chance

114
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,166
the proprietress of what was
known as the Tropical Fish?

115
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,083
Huh?

116
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,291
I was.

117
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,875
Ahh! We were certain
it was thee before us!

118
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,500
But how? How do
you know who I am?

119
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,416
By Miiko's many tales of thee.

120
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,125
Oh my god, you know Miiko?

121
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,625
Miiko is one we hold
most dear in our heart.

122
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:49,250
Wait! Is Miiko
actually with you? Here?

123
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,958
What was that?

124
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,083
Tis Miiko.

125
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,458
Free me! Free me!

126
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:03,000
An eternity in hell awaits
those who would bind me here!

127
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,250
Boss! You gotta
help us out here!

128
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,833
Boss! This thing won't stop!
I can't take it anymore!

129
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,750
I swear, it's driving
me outta my mind!

130
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:10,958
So you wanna go back to begging

131
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,916
for handouts in
the streets, is that it?

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Just shut up and
do what I pay ya for!

133
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,791
Who is that?

134
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,458
That was your friend Miiko.

135
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,625
What?!

136
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,083
She was overtaken
by the spirit of Hiruko.

137
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:27,250
Wait "overtaken"?

138
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,625
The hell's that mean?

139
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,500
Call it "possession"
if you like.

140
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,916
See for yourself, and perhaps
you could explain it better.

141
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,666
Free! Me!

142
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,041
Miiko. Prithee, calm thyself.

143
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,416
We are here. Thy dear poppet.

144
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,583
We bring Momoko with
us to bid thee well, Miiko.

145
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:49,041
Behold! 'Tis truly Momoko,
thy boon companion.

146
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,333
Prithee Momoko.
Come hither. Make haste!

147
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,708
Okay.

148
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:18,666
Mo. Momoko.
Momo. Momo. Momo.

149
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:25,333
Momo. Momo.
Momo. Momo-ko.

150
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:29,500
Momo. Momo.
My dearest friend.

151
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,083
Miiko.

152
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,208
I mean, it's just
not possible.

153
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,333
It has to be some
kinda joke, right?

154
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:42,458
God I hope so.
It's too disturbing.

155
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,458
There's no way I'm buying
that girl and I are sisters.

156
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,833
And that horrible
creature just cannot be Miiko.

157
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,291
What the--?

158
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,500
Looks like it came from Duomo!

159
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,083
What in the hell
is going on here?

160
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,291
Hey! Kuniko!

161
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,541
What happened?!

162
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,250
It's those plants.
There are so many of 'em!

163
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,666
Is that all of them?

164
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,416
God, I hope so.

165
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,208
President!

166
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,625
Is that...

167
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,416
Yeah, there was way more.

168
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,791
We were sure we'd
got all of 'em last time.

169
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,875
But it's like tons more
just cropped up overnight.

170
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,875
They keep firing
those seeds everywhere.

171
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,708
No one's hurt? You're okay?

172
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,250
Yeah. No one got
seriously hurt or anything.

173
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,791
That's good.

174
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,916
We cut down every single one
of those things we could find.

175
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,875
But they're all over
town so we should probably

176
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,208
keep looking just
to be on the safe side.

177
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,041
Yeah, you're right. Thank you.

178
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,083
It looks like you've been

179
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,541
working your
tail off around here.

180
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,916
Aw, well... How did
your thing go today?

181
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,375
The bombing plan
got started at least.

182
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,250
I see.

183
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,000
We don't have any
time to waste, though.

184
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,750
As you can see, the Daedalus
infestation on Level Eight has

185
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,541
exceeded our
original projections

186
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,083
at an alarming speed.

187
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,625
At this point,
there is mounting concern

188
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,541
that it will spread
to the other levels.

189
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,208
Shion. That thing on your face.

190
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,500
It's revolting.
I can't look at you.

191
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,083
Please, forgive me.

192
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,250
Such a persistent little weed.

193
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:44,791
Pray, Sayoko.

194
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,375
Yes ma'am? What vexes thee?

195
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,333
Our visitors had
used the word sister,

196
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,750
but we do not fully
comprehend its meaning.

197
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,125
Prithee, tell us
indeed what the girl Kuniko

198
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,875
meant by that word.
I surmise.

199
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,833
It may have some
meaning that could correlate

200
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,541
its occurrence to the
mentioning of our mother.

201
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,625
That is a rather shrewd
deduction you have made milady.

202
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,500
The term "sister" is used to
describe the bond with a girl

203
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,083
that is born to the
same mother as one's self.

204
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,291
Sayoko. Dost thou
think it possible this

205
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,750
Kuniko could be born
of our mother as well?

206
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,875
I have a difficult time
believing that a street urchin

207
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,666
such as that could share
the same mother as one

208
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,083
so exalted as you.

209
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,916
Indeed. But how
then did she come

210
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,583
to possess our
mother's earring?

211
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,041
That remains a mystery.

212
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,250
We cannot say for
certain it was truly hers.

213
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,250
If it be so perhaps she
knows something of our mother.

214
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,958
Miss Mikuni. The one thing
of which I am most certain

215
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:37,291
is your destiny at the highest
level of Atlas, your birthright.

216
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,833
Other matters cannot distract
us from the path of ascension.

217
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,000
"Bombing Tokyo?
The girl has a crazy way

218
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,916
of dealing with her
problems, doesn't she?"

219
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,166
Just think about it.

220
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,875
It's gonna blow Japan's
carbon index sky high.

221
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,125
And if we get tipped off to
when the raid is gonna happen,

222
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,416
we could make a killing off
trading at just the right time.

223
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,208
"Absolutely right. Karin
you are a Grade-A genius!"

224
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,500
Tell me all about that blade!

225
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,625
"Exactly the same in form
and composition to Mikuni's."

226
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,375
But according to this report,
it's not some kind of replica,

227
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,708
it's more like they're
two parts of a matching set,

228
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,458
of three I bet.

229
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,291
Which means there's one more.

230
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,083
Now you do realize to pull
this off we're gonna have to

231
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,625
figure out where
the evacuees will go.

232
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:41,833
Underground?

233
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:42,958
I'm sure there are gonna be

234
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,500
way too many people
for that to work.

235
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,041
You're right.

236
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,958
Should you be here?

237
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,000
Say what?

238
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,333
With us. Ya know, here?

239
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,208
I mean this is the Metal Age
command center after all.

240
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,833
I thought we were
all in this together

241
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,041
to try and save people's lives.

242
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:07,500
You're right. And I know
just the place. Right here.

243
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,875
In Atlas?! That's nuts.

244
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,250
No way.

245
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,916
Sorry, but the government'll
never go along with it.

246
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Alright, so you tell me
where we can take these people!

247
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,750
Well, well,
what do we have here?

248
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,833
Nagiko!

249
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:32,416
Looks to me like everybody's
burning the midnight oil.

250
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,958
I brought some snacks!

251
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,958
So... Momoko's earring.

252
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,125
Is it true that it
belonged to my mother?

253
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,791
That's her story at least.

254
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,958
I'm glad to see you've
been stirring it like I asked.

255
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,583
That's not why you came back.

256
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:53,000
I can't help but marvel at
the ingenuity of our ancestors.

257
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,375
They had rice bran
and they had vegetables.

258
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,208
And they managed to
make them work together

259
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,625
to create something
new and amazing.

260
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:03,791
Something that we, especially
you, still cherish today.

261
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,375
Hello, I did banish you.

262
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,791
Would you like to know a secret?

263
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,041
A couple of old nails
will help the eggplant

264
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,375
retain that beautiful color.

265
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,458
You'd probably be
inclined to just throw

266
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:20,041
the rusty old things away,
but they're still handy.

267
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,416
Grandma!

268
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,083
You're bombing Tokyo, yes?

269
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,208
How'd you know?

270
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,000
Those "Neo Guild" fools.

271
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,750
Raising a clamor over
trying to buy troops.

272
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,083
But if you want to find
a solution to your problem

273
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,750
it won't be done with
gun-wielding mercenaries.

274
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,625
You do have a person who once

275
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:42,041
held some
influence in your corner.

276
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:45,333
Not every woman can claim
to be the mother of Atlas.

277
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,291
But I'm not sure
that I can trust you.

278
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,666
You don't have to trust me.

279
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,416
I'm a tool at your disposal.
Just put me to use.

280
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,541
Like these rusty old nails here.

281
00:15:56,916 --> 00:16:00,666
It's just business, really.
You get what you want from me,

282
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,625
and I get what I want
from you. No harm, no ill will.

283
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,125
Nothing more than that.

284
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,333
So why don't you lay
out what you want from me?

285
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:17,250
Access to the
top level of Atlas.

286
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,000
Now, the woman at the
head of that organization

287
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,750
has very little in the
way of redeeming qualities.

288
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,166
And, if I requested to
meet with her personally,

289
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,416
she'd no doubt refuse
without much consideration.

290
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,125
But if I were to have you at
my side, things would change.

291
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:35,041
Yeah. Why would I
make such a difference to her?

292
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:39,541
Because you just would.
She'd find it intriguing.

293
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,458
Come now child.
Don't ignore the fact

294
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,916
that you two have a history.
Or have you forgotten?

295
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,791
Hey, Furukawa,
where's the mimetic armor?

296
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,125
Thank you, sir.

297
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,458
I haven't seen this
thing in quite a while.

298
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,500
Caused me a lot of grief
when I came back without it.

299
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,750
Yeah, sorry.

300
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:06,875
Hey...

301
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:07,750
Yeah?

302
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,291
You're on board with all this?

303
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,083
I mean, Atlas is
where you grew up.

304
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,375
All of your family
and friends are there.

305
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,416
Are you sure you
can fight with us?

306
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,833
I'm not fighting, I'm helping.

307
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,333
Besides, I haven't
officially joined Metal Age.

308
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,000
So that should
make it okay, right?

309
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:29,375
This is for the
greater good. For all of us.

310
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,791
Okay.

311
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,333
Hey, love...

312
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,833
Courage got you here
but charm seals the deal.

313
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,333
Ms. Nagiko Hojo, we've
been expecting your arrival.

314
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,416
Madam Naruse awaits you.

315
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,125
Does she now?

316
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,041
The return of one
of the founders of Atlas.

317
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,000
And this is all you
can muster up, eh?

318
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,916
It's been quite
a while, Ms. Hojo.

319
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:01,791
Not long enough for you,
I'll bet. A peace offering.

320
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,000
I appreciate
the thoughtful gesture.

321
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:07,833
Do you? So what's happened
to the leadership here?

322
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:11,125
We've taken decisive steps
to ensure the future of Atlas.

323
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,750
Is that not the goal you had
in mind all those years ago?

324
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,333
Not like this it wasn't, no.

325
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,666
I see. I suppose you've come
to bring us enlightenment?

326
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,291
Tokyo has gotta burn.

327
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,541
Is that so?

328
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,083
There's no other way to erase
the harm you've done to it.

329
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,333
The monster you've created
has to be stopped right now!

330
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:36,000
If we don't do something, it'll
take over the whole country.

331
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,458
Monster, you say?

332
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,583
The Daedalus!

333
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,125
Ahh. Of course.

334
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:43,458
That was not
entirely our creation.

335
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,291
We simply made
some modifications.

336
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,416
I see. Life is just your toy?

337
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,875
No, we improve it.

338
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,541
The plant is the
pinnacle of resilience now.

339
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,083
We've already started
taking care of the logistics

340
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,375
of the bombing raid. Basically,
we're being kind enough

341
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,958
to clean up the mess you made

342
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,375
while you were
trying to play God.

343
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,916
So carpet-bombing a
city is "cleaning up?'

344
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,833
Do you realize the
amount of carbon you'll be

345
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,791
responsible for releasing
into the atmosphere?

346
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,875
My word. You can't offer
your guests a cup of tea?

347
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,625
It's all business
with you, eh? Have a snack.

348
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,291
Listen. We need you to
do your part for the people

349
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,500
out there and give
them a safe place to go.

350
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,333
Those unfortunates
are not my responsibility.

351
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:33,666
Atlas is my primary concern.
Its future is Japan's future.

352
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,916
Ultimately, the survival
of Atlas is paramount.

353
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,083
The collateral damage
from the outliers is a pity.

354
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:44,833
But we won't take refugees.
There's no room.

355
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,916
Ah, well. Not surprised.

356
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,958
Yeah, it's me.
They're not budging,

357
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,500
so it looks like
we're going with Plan B.

358
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,000
Roger.

359
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,750
What's that?

360
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,833
Madam Ryoko.

361
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:19,750
Yes?

362
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,000
The Daedalus on Level Eight.

363
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,041
They're all
ejecting their seeds.

364
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,500
They seem to be
mounting an attack on

365
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,208
the central shaft's
power terminal.

366
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,125
It's taking quite a bit of fire.

367
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,291
But why? There shouldn't
be any heat sources

368
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,166
in that area, it's uninhabited.

369
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,625
It's all logistics, my friend.
There's someone on our team

370
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:40,375
who is extremely familiar with
the way this place operates.

371
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,333
Atlas may be a fortress
against the outside,

372
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,208
but what about
an attack from within?

373
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,250
Cause, I bet it
wasn't in the plan.

374
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,583
You came here to threaten me?

375
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:54,625
Oh no. Of course not.
We're here to bargain.

376
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:05,125
Oh my, you're
quite the firebrand.

377
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:08,708
So... Do we have a deal?

378
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:13,291
Okay. I'll give you
what you're asking for.

379
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,083
The buildings will burn.

380
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:48,916
The work of human hands,
the dream of future happiness.

381
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,625
But the fire can
never erase the memories.

382
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:55,583
I wish there was another way.
But I'll go on with no regrets.

383
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:58,041
Next time: "Tokyo Airstrike"
