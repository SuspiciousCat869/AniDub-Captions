1
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,041
It's time. Get a move on.

2
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:06,541
Kuniko! Kuniko!
Kuniko! Kuniko!

3
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:07,541
Knock it off!

4
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:08,875
Don't forget us in here!

5
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:10,916
Give 'em Hell
when you get back!

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,916
You better write!

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,666
Or just get nicked again!

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,416
This place won't be
the same without ya!

9
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,625
Listen up!

10
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:26,958
Today's the day!
The world's my oyster!

11
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,916
Good luck out there, kid.

12
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,708
Now, if I ever lay eyes on
you again, it'll be too soon.

13
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,208
Understood?

14
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,916
No one's here.

15
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,125
Momoko!

16
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,666
 You little delinquent.

17
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,333
Oh, honey it's so
good to love your neck.

18
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,791
When'd you shave last?

19
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:54,083
When'd you eat last?
The girls are lookin' starved.

20
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,916
Hello! Hot-button issue!

21
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,833
Oi! Ya ridin' or ain't ya?

22
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,083
Didn't expect
to see you, old man!

23
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,875
Now don't start
taking that tone with me.

24
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,583
Oh, pumpkin.

25
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,958
Miiko!

26
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:11,291
These past two years
have been an eternity.

27
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,916
D'ya gain a
pound for each month?

28
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,208
Ugh! You scrummy harlot!

29
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,041
Enough with the tears.

30
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,000
Just 'cause your face
is built like a storm levee

31
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,000
doesn't mean you
have to use it like one.

32
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,166
You are just the
worst kind of harpy.

33
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,041
Who'd better have
brought what I asked her.

34
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,750
Please. I look
like a rhinestone?

35
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,333
Just promise to play nice.

36
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,083
How's this for nice?!

37
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,833
And that is?

38
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,250
A clink rag.

39
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,208
They had me salute this
stupid thing day and night,

40
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,166
so I'm owed a little revenge.

41
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,875
But, now I can move on.

42
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,833
'kay. Homeward bound, then.

43
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,666
Duomo become a
hustling boom town yet?

44
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,250
Oh yes. Poverty's the
new affluent, it's fab.

45
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,416
Lots of new hoi polloi
have set up tent there.

46
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,708
Ooohhh! Fresh meat!

47
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,250
The Shokuan block's been sinking

48
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,666
like Atlantis
in slow-mo, though.

49
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,041
So, you know,
there goes the neighborhood.

50
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,291
Yep.

51
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,458
Curtain in five, people!

52
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,375
The old lady wants to see
you first thing, ya hear?

53
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:48,833
So why doncha--
Hey! Butter troll!

54
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,750
Move! Ah, damn it.

55
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:56,208
Relax. One doesn't
put a tether on the wind.

56
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,791
She'll get where's she's
going in her own time.

57
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,458
Hey! She's back!

58
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
"What began as disparate
acts of civil disobedience

59
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,791
against the
environmental austerity

60
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,250
charters enacted
by the government became,

61
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,791
in time, the
Metal Age movement."

62
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,916
"When new, draconian
CO2 emissions sta-"

63
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:26,583
The polite way to absorb
knowledge is by sitting still.

64
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,708
Take a good,
hard look around you, girl.

65
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,458
These are the
relics of a bygone age.

66
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:33,833
The Carbon Market
would hemorrhage

67
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,416
to see the remnants
of so many felled trees.

68
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,416
Yet the wisdom
represented here is priceless.

69
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,375
Unavailable to
the idle web-surfer.

70
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:46,291
Perhaps the old
forests' greatest legacy.

71
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,583
Where wisdom's concerned,

72
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,750
the internet conceals
far more than it yields.

73
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,666
When, during the course of your
glory as Metal Age's leader,

74
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,375
you find yourself at a loss.

75
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:02,083
Kuniko! You could
at least wait to tear off

76
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,250
until I've said my piece!

77
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,166
Love ya, grandma!

78
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:10,166
So the prodigal
granddaughter has returned, eh?

79
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,583
What was your first clue?

80
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,791
Kuniko?

81
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,708
Whoa there, girlie,
hang on! They break you out?

82
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,458
Naw I'm out fair and square!

83
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,083
Here. Help wash down
the taste o' freedom.

84
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,875
Thank you!

85
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,291
No prob.

86
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,166
That's good. I'm glad to
see they haven't broken her.

87
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,250
Yeah.

88
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,708
Should I know her?

89
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,500
Ah. You've never
had the pleasure.

90
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:48,541
Kuniko Hojo.
Nagiko's wild granddaughter.

91
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,875
That's the girl
she's grooming to be

92
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,916
Metal Age's next president?

93
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,291
I'm not so sure 'bout that.

94
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,125
Hey, where's my souvenir?

95
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,958
Next time, I promise!

96
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,666
I'm not gonna hold
my breath, cheapskate!

97
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:32,750
Your report, Shogo.
Something I can use.

98
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,208
Madam.

99
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,833
Digma 2 has been released

100
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,208
from the girls'
correctional facility.

101
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,666
She's returned home to Sector
E-51, commonly known as Duomo.

102
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,708
Shion. Watch your fingernails!

103
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,291
My sincerest apologies!

104
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,083
Continue to monitor her actions.

105
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,708
As you wish, madam.

106
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,708
So the Sun assumes its Chariot.

107
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,375
And where pray tell
does that leave the Moon?

108
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,958
As she ever is, madam.

109
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,916
Touring the lower
realms at her fancy.

110
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:11,791
Feast your eyes on that.
What'd I tell ya, huh?

111
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,541
Are you sure this is legal?

112
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,666
I mean, Atlas has those
barricades for a reason.

113
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,125
Whose rank you think
got us through 'em?

114
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,666
Ready the gun!

115
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,500
All apologies
for the noise, milady.

116
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,666
How exhilarating
the lower realms are!

117
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,416
They held a BC rank?

118
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,625
I'll not have Miss
Mikuni's promenade savaged

119
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,541
by such a troglodyte!

120
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:17,250
For propriety, let us
promote them to AG.

121
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,166
Sayoko. Prithee let
us see all the fuss.

122
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,083
No, milady. 'Twould no
doubt sully your vision.

123
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,125
No? Thou art an icy warden!

124
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,208
Indeed. That I am.

125
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,958
Chop, chop!
The eclipse is spent!

126
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:54,458
Hey, Tokyo! I'm back!

127
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,333
Fine. If you insist, I'll recap.

128
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,000
You're familiar with
the concept of Carbon Tax?

129
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:09,041
The levy designed to diminish
global CO2 emissions. Very.

130
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,625
The rate of taxation fluctuates
with a given country's ratio

131
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:15,208
of carbon emissions to carbon
absorption. I'm not stupid!

132
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,458
'course not.

133
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,333
Now Japan's carbon
index holds firm

134
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,166
at one-point-twelve
at the moment.

135
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,125
Whereas your homeland is at a
whopping two-point-forty-eight.

136
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,291
Meaning you basically owe

137
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,708
two-thousand,
four-hundred eighty marks

138
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:29,291
per thousand marks of output.
Not a sustainable rate.

139
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,791
Spout those numbers out to
my face and I might take you

140
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,875
seriously, otherwise you
can just go to Hell!

141
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,208
Face-time is so your generation.

142
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,125
Get with the era, sourpuss.

143
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,416
Economies aren't built
on the back nine anymore.

144
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,875
We have that purview to thank

145
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,000
for despoiling the
planet in the first place.

146
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,041
You had your chance
and you blew it.

147
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,583
Carbonists do
things differently.

148
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,416
I'm painfully aware of that.

149
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,083
This monetized carbon scheme's
derailed the whole goddamn game!

150
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,375
Don't blame the charters for

151
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,750
your country's knee-jerk
reluctance to comply.

152
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,875
No one forced you to hedge
your bets against astronomical

153
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,666
tariffs by industrializing to
the hilt. That was your choice.

154
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,916
Sure, you figured like
every other dissenting nation

155
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,333
you'd outsmart the system
by balancing the penalties

156
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,458
against the living wage you

157
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,458
consistently deny
your workforce.

158
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,833
But that's exactly the kind of

159
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,458
out-moded quasi-imperialist
strategy the Carbon Tax

160
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,708
is designed to render obsolete.

161
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,916
The longer a country
takes to reduce its actual

162
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,333
carbon emissions, the higher the
interest rate grows on the tax.

163
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,583
Ergo your present impasse.

164
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,958
You blather to me about
imperialism when a handful

165
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,125
of well-heeled nations
unilaterally impose a--

166
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,833
If you don't like it, become
a self-sufficient economy

167
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,625
unto yourselves and pull
out of the global market!

168
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,875
Sign a contract with us
here at Ishida Finance

169
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,500
and we'll assume
the tax debt for up to

170
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,750
one-hundred million tons
of your carbon output.

171
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,375
It's as simple as that.

172
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,625
We'll transfer the lien to
our LCTI holding company

173
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,208
when the balance
becomes amortized across--

174
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:49,000
Thank you. I believe
I have the gist of it.

175
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,500
In lieu of curbing pollution,
we'll just be shrinking

176
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:56,166
an imaginary number vis-à-vis
the "monetized carbon" racket.

177
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,666
It's outright fraud!

178
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,083
I assure you
it's perfectly legal.

179
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,958
Quite so, sir. If it weren't,
our country would be complicit

180
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,375
in a charter-breaking
act from which

181
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,375
Ishida would have
nothing to gain.

182
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,375
I'd listen to the suits at
your shoulder, Mr. Abidin.

183
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,000
Rest easy
knowing our company

184
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,250
owns copyright on Medusa.

185
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,083
The only computer program in
the world capable of packaging

186
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:19,083
one-hundred-million tons
of monetized carbon derivatives

187
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,500
and cleanly,
legally, hedging

188
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,291
the collateralized
risk obligation.

189
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,583
Any other program would

190
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,041
spell bankruptcy so
fast your head would spin.

191
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,375
This is a mathematically
proven fact, by the way,

192
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,958
not just a pitch.

193
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,875
If you'd like to read my
doctoral thesis on the subject--

194
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,708
I have read it.

195
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:39,666
Good. Then we can wrap things
up. You're a hard sell, sir.

196
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,208
It doesn't usually
take me half as long

197
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,625
as this to secure a contract.

198
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,208
I remind you, Minister:
while you sit there comfortably

199
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,916
weighing your country's options,

200
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,833
your people buckle under
the weight of its debt.

201
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:55,083
Please, sir. Make your decision.

202
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,500
This is what I'm reduced to.

203
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:02,375
Selling my own soul to spare
my country the indignity.

204
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,375
Well done!

205
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,666
Your contract with
Ishida Finance is now official.

206
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,208
One point zero. Just like that.

207
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,125
After decades of
unmitigated toil,

208
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,958
it's as easy as waving
your goddamned hand.

209
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:25,000
Yep. Sign of the times.

210
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:33,125
Wow, Pudding. We busted our
hinnies for that one, huh?

211
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,583
"That we did, Karin.

212
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:38,125
We got some IM's from Klaris
and the guys, by the way."

213
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,166
Let 'em wait. I'm tired.

214
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,041
"Like Mommy and Daddy?" 

215
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,916
They have very busy schedules.

216
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,250
I'll see what
they're up to later.

217
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,541
"I'll bet they'll
be super proud

218
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,125
of all the neat
stuff we did today, huh?"

219
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,708
Yeah!

220
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,666
Help me. Help me. Help me.

221
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,958
I know you're
scared, little fella,

222
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,625
but that's exactly what
makes you so useful.

223
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,000
Panic brings on
the big bad flood.

224
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:05,583
And the big bad flood is
what's keeping you on the alert.

225
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,083
However short-lived,
one-hundred-million tons

226
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,875
of CO2 doesn't
simply disappear. Yes?

227
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,208
Zeus monitors the flow
of debt-to-absorption

228
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,958
as closely as it can, madam.

229
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:19,000
But the market is an
exceptionally complex entity.

230
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,833
So you've no idea
who's responsible.

231
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,041
No ma'am.

232
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,458
Launch a full
investigation, tout suite.

233
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:29,166
The Carbon Market can in no way
abide anomalies of this nature.

234
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,791
I will not have the Atlas
project compromised.

235
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,750
Of course. As you wish.

236
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,291
Madam, if I may.

237
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,083
This is, confessedly,
little more than

238
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,666
an educated guess
on my part,

239
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,541
but I believe Metal Age
to be our likeliest culprit.

240
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,958
Yes, go on.

241
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,583
They may pose as a
mere guerilla movement,

242
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,500
but their leader's
heir apparent, Digma Two,

243
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:51,750
does possess a natural
mastery of the Carbon Market.

244
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,583
There's my girl.

245
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,208
Guilty as charged.

246
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,125
Don't tell me you're
hiding from yours truly.

247
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,958
Honey, I know that crooked
lil' mind better than you.

248
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,666
This place has been
your tree house since

249
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,000
you were knee-high
to a farthingale.

250
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,833
It's where you flock
to settle your feathers.

251
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,791
Speaking of which, your
grandmother's have been ruffled.

252
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,416
Ugh! I just wish
she'd give up on the whole

253
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,708
"one day this will all
be yours" song and dance!

254
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,750
I mean, I've been locked up
for two freakin' years already!

255
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,541
I hate how the pre-quake
geners always play for keeps.

256
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,875
It's her song and dance.

257
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,541
The wind oughtta blow
where it damn-well pleases.

258
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,666
The ol' girl's a battle axe;
I'm sure she can cope.

259
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:39,291
All I want for you, sweet pea,
is whatever makes you happiest.

260
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,250
If you just want to be
a normal teenage girl,

261
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,250
then knock yourself out.

262
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,083
Seriously, Takehiko?

263
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,375
They're gonna
catch Hell for that.

264
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,000
We better go shut 'em down.

265
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,166
Taking toys from
naughty boys is my forte.

266
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:06,333
Burn baby, burn!
Today's a day to celebrate!

267
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,291
Show those EM satellites
how much we give a damn!

268
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,791
What are you doing?! You're
gonna make the market spike!

269
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:15,166
You've been outta touch with the
market for a while, jailbird.

270
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,500
Nothing we're doing here is
gonna bump the "precious index"

271
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:21,166
up more than point-fifteen
percent. I did the math myself.

272
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,708
Uh, sir.

273
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,208
The carbon index just jumped
by point-thirty-eight percent.

274
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,583
You lug-head!

275
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,333
We throw the market
outta kilter we're gonna get

276
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,125
a Hell of a lot
more than a fine!

277
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,208
Do ya wanna bring
the Carbon Police in?!

278
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,750
Oh, but he did the math.

279
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,166
Takehiko! We got company!

280
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,916
But how?! It's been,
like, what? A minute?!

281
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,375
Kuniko!

282
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,708
What have we got?

283
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,166
Have a look!

284
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:53,083
That's not the Carbon Police!
What the? The ARMY?!

285
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,750
Suit up! It's the
freakin' slags!

286
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,291
Get to the marketplace, now!

287
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:10,208
We owed them a warning!
At least a warning shot.

288
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,583
I believe the
rules of engagement

289
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,750
are very clear
on that point, sir.

290
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:17,208
Lieutenant Kusanagi, don't
forget the pecking order.

291
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,000
In no way is the
Atlas Corporation

292
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,833
beholden to military protocol.

293
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,791
Nor does it have
qualms with demoting you.

294
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,666
So you keep saying.

295
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,750
If these guys have your pluck,

296
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,416
it ought to be a very
interesting skirmish.

297
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,416
Doubt they have as fancy
an heirloom, though.

298
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,416
Get ready!
Protect the square, guys!

299
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Don't let the
bastards get near it!

300
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,000
Typical slag
mindset at work here.

301
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,583
We let out a little
smoke so they come in

302
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,166
and bulldoze an entire block.

303
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,500
Kuniko! Your grandma
wants you to have this.

304
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,083
Not now okay?!

305
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,250
This emblem is your birthright!

306
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,958
You take it. I'm not interested!

307
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,083
Hey--!

308
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,666
Now what?

309
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,166
You slags got no
right to be here!

310
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,875
Why don't you go back
to lapping up the stink

311
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:26,250
of your corporate overlords?!
Get lost! Oh, big man?!

312
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,958
You don't get to call yourselves
soldiers in my neighborhood

313
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,125
if you pull this kind of crap!

314
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,916
A girl?

315
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:51,666
Hello, Digma Two. Thorny
little rosebush, aren't we?

316
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,041
Are you the leader of Metal Age?

317
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:57,375
Uh well,
technically speaking, no.

318
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,625
And yet you make a big
show of cat-calling us?!

319
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,166
Look, it's kind of a
complicated issue, okay?

320
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,166
I'm really not even part
of Metal Age. Except, I...

321
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,083
Whatever, the point is you can't
treat innocent people like this!

322
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,625
Well these so
called "innocent people"

323
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,000
have been turning a
blind eye to terrorism.

324
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,625
We're terrorists for belching
out a tiny bit of smoke?!

325
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,375
That's not what
I'm talking about!

326
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,000
Then what's the problem?

327
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,291
Way to play fair!

328
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,250
No one opens fire on my girl!

329
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,791
Now!

330
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,916
Oh, hon. Your body
would make much shorter

331
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,375
of the shocks if your
movements weren't so erratic.

332
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,708
But...

333
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,791
Don't argue; focus.
And for the love of Dinah,

334
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,791
don't be caught in the
trenches without your lipstick.

335
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,541
There. Now you're
dressed to kill.

336
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,333
You wanna grab some coffee?

337
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,375
No!

338
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,916
I'm a sucker for
a man in uniform.

339
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,583
Hiya, boys!

340
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,250
You jerks!

341
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,958
Ow! Gah!!!

342
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,833
Stand down before you make
things worse for everybody!

343
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,250
Shut up!!!

344
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,250
What in the--?

345
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,750
Huh?

346
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,833
Milady.

347
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,083
Wherefore this strange music?

348
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,833
I swear I've heard that before.

349
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:48,666
The old forests shed
noxious, lethal tears.

350
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:53,083
And every so often, bitter
conflict yields kindred spirits.

351
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,666
Next time: "The Poison
Swamp of Ikebukuro."
