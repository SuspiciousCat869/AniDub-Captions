1
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:23,708
Confirm. Titan is hovering
directly over Akihabara.

2
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:25,791
Gotcha!

3
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,041
Karin! Get the
hell out of there!

4
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,500
Don't leave!

5
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,416
The hell?! What's
happening down there?

6
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:32,125
Farewell, dear Miiko.

7
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,041
Look out, milady!

8
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:56,541
Stop acting like this!
Do what your mother tells you!

9
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,875
We're gettin' hit, boss.
We gotta get outta here!

10
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,541
There's no time for that!

11
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,208
But this place'll collapse!

12
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,625
So I'm being kicked out
of my own home now, is that it?

13
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,916
You got an
eviction notice handy?!

14
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,833
Take my word
for it, if I had one.

15
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,458
Never mind all that.
We've gotta get you--

16
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,916
Take a hint! I'm not going
anywhere till I've wrangled

17
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,041
this pain-in-the-ass
program back into its cage!

18
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,791
There's too much
money riding on it!

19
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,875
Medusa!

20
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,291
Sorry, boss.

21
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,208
Hey! Put me the hell down!

22
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,500
Shut up!

23
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,291
I'm gonna have your
head on a plate for this.

24
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:39,250
You're too ugly to play the
knight in shining armor! Let go!

25
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,166
Do you have an off switch?!

26
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,625
Titan is reporting mission
complete. According to the U.N.,

27
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,625
the Neo Guild headquarters
is completely leveled.

28
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,458
Encouraging to know
the U.N. is good for something.

29
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,500
The ground team sent
in for retrieval confirms that

30
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,375
Digma One survived the blast,
but they have a lock on her.

31
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:06,166
And what of the Karin
girl? Blown to ribbons?

32
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,500
We haven't been able
to establish that as of yet,

33
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,500
but the likelihood is high.

34
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:26,333
This is insanity. No way they
weren't targeting this building.

35
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,791
Hey! We've got
survivors over here!

36
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,916
Hey. Your balls have
dropped, haven't they?

37
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,958
What in the hell are
you still doing up here?

38
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,625
Right!

39
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,416
It's over boys.

40
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,708
Hey man. Where's the boss?
And what happened to your face?

41
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:48,625
Long story. Trust me. And
don't call her boss anymore.

42
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:52,375
Ugh, I risked my neck savin'
that penniless little brat.

43
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:56,166
That's right, you
heard me. Party's over.

44
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,750
The syndicate gig is kaput.

45
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,958
The Carbon King of Gotanda.

46
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,958
Uguisudani's Billionaire club.

47
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:10,625
Seconds ago I had more scratch
than all of 'em combined.

48
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:14,583
Now I don't even have enough
to call myself a Neo-Carbonist.

49
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,541
It's not fair. I mean,
I just wanted to have dinner.

50
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,000
Sorry, Mom and Dad.

51
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,458
I thought if I made enough,
we could be together.

52
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,875
We hate them! We hate them!

53
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,000
They art the
limit of wickedness!

54
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,791
Why hath Miiko to die?!

55
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,916
She was not the bombing's
intended, I'm certain.

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,291
Something larger
was afoot here, milady.

57
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,708
The powers behind this
shall truly know our vengeance.

58
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,833
Lady Mikuni. We've come
to deliver you home.

59
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:58,750
If you'd do us the honor,
Atlas awaits you.

60
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,916
Milady. We should consent.
Miiko's death will be

61
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,375
better avenged
from a seat of power.

62
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,916
Let it be Atlas' debt to you.

63
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,708
We act on orders given us
from no less august a person

64
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,875
than the Prime Minister,
your ladyship.

65
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:20,166
You do, however, have the
right to refuse this escort.

66
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,291
We consent. To honor
our sweet Miiko.

67
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,333
In that case, milady...

68
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,666
Fool.

69
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,500
There won't be a seat of power
left if Medusa has its way.

70
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,375
Japan's facing down
the barrel of a gun.

71
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,791
Sorry about that!

72
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,916
Aw. You're doin' just fine.

73
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,125
Thank you.

74
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,375
Don't be such
a child, sugar lips.

75
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,916
Just keep your
mind on the pearls.

76
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:59,208
Seriously? You're gonna have
to explain that to me some time.

77
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,875
Man. It seems like
there's no end to this.

78
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,666
Hey! Karin!

79
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,958
Just what in the hell
you think you're doing?!

80
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:16,208
"Nothing. In case
you hadn't noticed."

81
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,291
Oh! Hilarious!
You got time to joke,

82
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,500
you got time to
tell your goons to hop-to!

83
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,375
You're the Neo Guild
leader, now act like it!

84
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:30,583
"Yeah. They don't take orders
from teddy bears. Sorry."

85
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,458
Hold it!

86
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,291
I don't know what
the bear thing is all about,

87
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,750
but I think you're
damn-well old enough

88
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,833
to start reapin' what you sow!

89
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,791
There's nothing I can do.

90
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,375
Medusa's shot off
to heaven knows where.

91
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,500
So, I'm pretty much powerless.

92
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,125
You can cut the
"pity me" act, princess!

93
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,958
Hell, you've had a
couple setbacks. Woe is you.

94
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:56,041
That doesn't mean you
have to keep wallowing in it!

95
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,166
We're tracking Medusa down.

96
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,750
Wait! Are you
even listening to me?!

97
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,250
We can't get so much as
a login prompt in this pit!

98
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,708
How you figure we're going
to track down a rogue AI?!

99
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,666
All I'm hearing
from you are excuses.

100
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,916
Can this thing be stopped?

101
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,875
If Medusa continues
to accrue land in Antarctica,

102
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,791
the carbon market will topple.

103
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,500
The world as we know
it will essentially end.

104
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,125
I confess to feeling fortunate

105
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,083
that we'll get
to watch it together.

106
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:30,000
Perhaps this is
the consolation of fate.

107
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,458
Perhaps it is
only fitting for us.

108
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,208
Don't try to sell me
on what you don't believe.

109
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,375
Surely the world is
made of sterner stuff

110
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,875
than can be undone by economics?

111
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,250
I hope so.

112
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,250
Right. Me and the
pigtails have gotta run.

113
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,708
But, thing is, I'm still
seein' a lot of folks who

114
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,916
need tending to so ya think
ya can stick around to help?

115
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,125
I'll take care of Medusa.
Don't know how, but I will.

116
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,291
You run along.

117
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,500
I'll stay and
make myself useful.

118
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:02,000
Great. Thank you. Come on.

119
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,583
Do you even know
where we're going?!

120
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:04,791
None of your business.

121
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,625
I can walk on my own, you know.

122
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:12,291
Not so long ago, I was leading
you by the hand like that.

123
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:16,833
But, you know, when I saw
what was left of Tropical Fish,

124
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,791
it put everything
in perspective.

125
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,583
Fifteen years of memories
burnt to the ground

126
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:26,625
don't hold a candle to the time
I've spent with you, sweetheart.

127
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:33,666
And here you
are now. All grown up.

128
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,625
What in the--?

129
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,625
They didn't leave
a damn thing standing.

130
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,541
Oh, my god. Don't tell me
the old guys didn't make it!

131
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,375
"The old guys"? Aw, man.

132
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,958
Raid!

133
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:08,333
Peekong bah-woooop!
Wveeep! Wveeep! Wveeep!

134
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,208
This is so wrong.

135
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,875
Who goes there?

136
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,000
Lovin' the angle.
And lovin' the pinstripes.

137
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,625
Excuse me?

138
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,125
I'm gonna make
you eat that camera!

139
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,083
Totally. Worth it.

140
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,958
So am I crazy? Or can
you guys pull some favors

141
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,333
and scare up
something that'll help us

142
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,875
stop Medusa in its tracks?

143
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,458
Are you even listening?

144
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,166
Yeah-eah-eah! I mean, no.
We're not miracle workers.

145
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,916
I have to concur.

146
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,791
These mothballs
are total freaks.

147
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,583
Hoh-hoh! Blush!

148
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,083
I'm not blushing,
this is anger you old geezer!

149
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,625
Extreme close-up shot!

150
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,416
How can you guys
just lounge around

151
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,000
playing with your tchotchkes?!

152
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,833
Serenity of mind is
absolutely crucial for

153
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,625
a warrior in times like these.

154
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,500
Okay, but there's serenity--

155
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,208
And then there's
whatever this is.

156
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,250
Geegonk!

157
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,916
You gonna tell
me what you're hiding

158
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,666
or do I need to go get Momoko?

159
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,875
Bah-wooomp!

160
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,708
Why on earth must
we be hiding something?

161
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,583
Whoa! So that
thing's still intact?

162
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,000
Of course it is.

163
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:17,208
But far too rickety to
do you any good, I fear.

164
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,416
Not that it could even
in the best of shape.

165
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,958
Oh yeah? Totally
and utterly useless?

166
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,000
You do realize that
if Medusa can't be stopped,

167
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:28,291
the whole economy's gonna
tank. Your little tchotchkes.

168
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,625
Their price'd
go through the roof.

169
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,083
Gwach!

170
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,333
We're talkin' cameras.

171
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,750
Come again?

172
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,416
And don't even get me started
on collectible handguns.

173
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,625
A sobering thought. Very well.

174
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,333
Tadaah!

175
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,750
This is that four-D
whachamacallit, yeah?

176
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,375
Looks like a phone booth.

177
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,708
You may eat those words when you
see what it can do, young lady.

178
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,750
Da-da-da-daaaaa-dun!

179
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:58,083
Sometimes a virtual simulator.
Sometimes a small-scale,

180
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,958
artillery-proof,
hermetically sealed,

181
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,541
fire-retardant
catastrophe shelter.

182
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,666
And in times like
these, a top-secret,

183
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,291
slow speed
evacuation elevator.

184
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,916
Plink, and so forth.

185
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
No pictures--!

186
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,125
So adorable when angry!

187
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,541
Ouchie.

188
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,583
Our underground HQ, ladies.
Or as we like to call it--

189
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,000
Ta-daaaaah!!!

190
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,333
Chez Ultra
Subterranean Shelter Z!

191
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:41,708
And I had to haggle for you
guys to let us in on this, why?

192
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,958
What?! You seriously
had stairs the whole time?

193
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,083
And if those stairs
had been blown out?

194
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,541
Contingency is everything.

195
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,333
Anyway, check it out. We've
hashed together a server rack

196
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,833
totally independent
of the Akihabra grid.

197
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,208
Ergo, we can access the Web

198
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,333
regardless of
conditions on the surface.

199
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,375
Why would you even build this?

200
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,791
Were you geriatrics hedging
on the Neo Guild's collapse

201
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,083
so you could move
in and take over

202
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,625
while the corpse
was still warm?!

203
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,958
Such underhanded
tactics are beneath mention

204
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:14,958
for a loyalist worth his--

205
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,375
But not beneath you!

206
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,333
Okay, you can bitch
about all this later.

207
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,541
What's our current
index reading?

208
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:28,125
Zero point nine-eight
and still on the decline.

209
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,250
It's cause the little bastard's
still taking out leases

210
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,000
on land in Antarctica.

211
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:35,458
We've got to put a stop
to it. By any means necessary.

212
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,958
Fascinating.

213
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,583
Move aside! If anyone's
going to put a stop to this!

214
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,458
It's gonna be me!

215
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,666
I'm back on, guys!

216
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,666
Hey hey! Awesome!
Glad you're still alive!

217
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,708
Of course she wasn't gonna let
herself be taken out like that.

218
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,958
Listen. I'm hunting
down Medusa once and for all.

219
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,708
I'm using this system
to hack into its action stream.

220
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,583
Snowball's chance in hell.

221
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:01,875
Huh?

222
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,583
We tried everything
we had after you cut out.

223
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:07,125
The thing is, it's putting
up firewalls like crazy.

224
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,083
We can't even get close.

225
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,333
What?! You're
telling me it's

226
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,291
beefed up its
hacking safeguards?

227
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,875
We'll have to put the kibosh
on it from the source, then.

228
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,458
Where do you have
its core system located?

229
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,208
In the Marshall
Islands. But, it--

230
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,458
I mean not even Titan
managed to get close enough

231
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,083
to do any damage.

232
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,541
See? Medusa just
keeps generating typhoons.

233
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,000
Gwohhhhhh!

234
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,458
I think we're
thoroughly checkmated.

235
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,708
I don't buy it.
There's gotta be a way.

236
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,083
This is a man-made system.

237
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,833
There has to be an Achilles'
heel we're not seeing.

238
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,333
Yes, I agree.
But if we can't get at it

239
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:48,041
by sea, sky, or online tactics.
What are our options here?

240
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,375
 Bingo!

241
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,750
If we can't approach
from the sky, we start higher.

242
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:59,250
Madam. We're seeing activity
on the old Akihabara network.

243
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,958
Someone appears
to be attempting to

244
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,375
hack into the Icarus satellite.

245
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,416
In for another
fascinating display, are we?

246
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,166
I swear. Dropping Icarus
on the core is something

247
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,916
only a meat-space manqué
like you would dream up.

248
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Watch your language!
I think it's a fine idea,

249
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,083
just focus on tearing
through the defenses.

250
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,958
Way ahead of you.
'kay, guys.

251
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,125
Get set.
We'll do this in teams.

252
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,958
Done and done. Klaris and I'll
calculate the descent vectors

253
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,958
to make sure it
re-enters where we want it.

254
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:30,250
You two should try and get
a lock on its guidance system.

255
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,125
We're on it. The name
of the game here is speed.

256
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,958
Not a problem.
Who are you again, though?

257
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:39,958
Okay. I'm now inside the U.N.'s
carbon management network.

258
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:44,000
Sweet. So, we just
hijack Icarus from here?

259
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,208
Yeah, like it's that easy.
I've gotta burrow through

260
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,833
all the firewalls
blocking the mainframe first.

261
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,041
Hmm. It's only a matter
of time before the breach

262
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:57,666
is detected so you'll have to
work fast. I'll get your back.

263
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,958
Seriously? Thank you, guys!

264
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,375
I'm seein' an exclusive
swimsuit photo spread

265
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,625
by way o' gratitude.

266
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,458
I wouldn't hold my breath.

267
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,333
C'mon. Hurry!

268
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:14,083
Right-o. Got it.
Descent vector calculated.

269
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,833
Looks like Icarus
will be over the window

270
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,833
in about fifteen seconds.

271
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,166
I've got two more
firewalls to get through!

272
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,875
Think swimsuits.

273
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,250
Ah da-da-bum, da-dum.

274
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,250
Just one more!

275
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,416
All clear!

276
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,708
Brake thrusters engaged!

277
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,625
Perfect! Right where
it needs to be!

278
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,000
Plus or minus ten meters,

279
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,041
Icarus is gonna drop
right onto Medusa's core!

280
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,875
Come on!

281
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,000
Da-dum. Da-da-dum.

282
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,083
We did it!

283
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,250
Bwah-bwah baaaaaam, bum!

284
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,541
I'll be damned.

285
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,208
We actually did it!

286
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,916
Photo shoot! High school
swim team uniforms all around!

287
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yippeee!

288
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,333
Pam-pam-pam,dwomp baaaaam!

289
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,916
I'm sorry, Medusa.
I really did want to save you.

290
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,750
Hey, guys?
Something's not right.

291
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,291
The Carbon Index is
still dropping like a rock!

292
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,250
But why?!
We scored a direct hit!

293
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,666
Yeah. It seemed that way, but if
the index is still falling...

294
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,625
Apparently Medusa's still alive
and kickin' out there somewhere.

295
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,416
He got away.

296
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,041
The attempt ended
in failure, madam.

297
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,000
So it would seem.

298
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,458
Shion.

299
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,000
Uh. Yes, ma'am?

300
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,916
I'm going to brief
the welcoming committee.

301
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,041
Can I count on your help?

302
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,250
Indeed! Thank you, ma'am!

303
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:00,958
Blast it!

304
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,041
Now what? What's the problem?!

305
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,000
This is real-time
satellite footage!

306
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,708
How the hell is the
typhoon still in full swing?

307
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,041
I don't know.
But I think the vector data

308
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:13,250
might have been,
well, falsified.

309
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,625
It's Medusa.

310
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,208
What?!

311
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,291
He's the only one who could've
pulled something like that off.

312
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,583
He must've anticipated
our move and hacked Icarus

313
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,041
way before we
ever took the wheel.

314
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,625
What's that?

315
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,291
Karin! Medusa just
inundated us with stats.

316
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,708
Are you seeing this?

317
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,208
Yeah I see it,
but I don't get it.

318
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,625
It's showing off!

319
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,708
The national defense
networks are being toyed with!

320
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,083
What do you
think it's tryin' to do?

321
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,291
The Nukes.

322
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,500
Excuse me?

323
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,625
It's accessing each
defense network in turn,

324
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:50,708
trying to wrestle control of
the world's nuclear arsenals.

325
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:51,833
Really?

326
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,250
Oh, god no!

327
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,375
If those warheads
get launched all at once,

328
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,125
we're talkin' nuclear winter!

329
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,833
What's that mean?

330
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,458
A mass detonation of
nuclear warheads would create

331
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:09,291
a cloud of radioactive smoke
and ash in the lower atmosphere.

332
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,125
The whole earth
would be covered.

333
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,916
Sunlight gets blocked,
temperatures plummet,

334
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,708
sea levels would drop
two-hundred meters or more,

335
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,208
even in the virtual
space Medusa calls home.

336
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,833
And I take it life as we know
it would be utterly wiped out.

337
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:26,458
From Medusa's perspective,
biological life is a nuisance.

338
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,500
All we do is
spread like wildfire

339
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,583
and emit carbon dioxide.

340
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,375
Karin! We have
to do something!

341
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:35,500
Yeah, like what? Our bag
of tricks is essentially empty.

342
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,375
Don't start talking
like that again!

343
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,625
There's got to be
something we haven't tried!

344
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,458
I've got nothing. No idea.

345
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,416
What about Zeus?

346
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,250
I bet that'd put the odds
more in our favor, wouldn't it?

347
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,875
I mean, it's supposed
to have its fingers

348
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,500
in every pie on
the planet, right?

349
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,041
That won't work.
Lady Mikuni's on her way

350
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,250
to Atlas now to
take ownership of it.

351
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,416
She's too obsessed with avenging
her friend's death to help us.

352
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,583
What?

353
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,458
Once she accepts
her place as Atlas' heir,

354
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,500
she'll be the only
person in the entire world

355
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,208
that'll be
able to command Zeus.

356
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,500
That doesn't make sense!

357
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,416
Geez, you guys really
are in the dark, huh?

358
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,416
The whole Atlas ranking
system is nothing more than

359
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,708
a placebo put into
effect for your benefit.

360
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,791
Is that what Takehiko
was trying to tell me?

361
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,750
It's between the three of you.
One of you is Atlas' heir.

362
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,250
Okay, that sounds
like all kinds of crazy.

363
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,958
You're one of them!

364
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,958
Whatever! Look, kid,
I'm about as far from

365
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,875
the top of the
heap as you can get.

366
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,083
Take my word for it.
What do you think that

367
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,041
fancy blade you carry
around really signifies?

368
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,875
Mikuni has all
three of them now,

369
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:47,041
which cinches her position
as, well, the "winner."

370
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:50,416
Hang on, the guys who stole
his blade were working for you?

371
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,125
What do you want?
I was basically

372
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,916
babysitting Lady Mikuni
at the time. If she became heir

373
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,166
I was gonna stand to
milk a buck-ton of cash

374
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,750
out of her by
offering my services.

375
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,208
You little brat! Do you
realize what you've done?!

376
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,958
Look, it's over,
alright? We lost.

377
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:07,416
I can't accept that!
We're heading to Atlas ASAP!

378
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,208
What the hell ya think
that's gonna accomplish?!

379
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,541
I am sick of that
defeatist attitude.

380
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,000
It's called realism. You
should try it out sometime!

381
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,083
You ankle-biting,
snot-nosed little--

382
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,250
All right. That's quite enough.

383
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:22,375
Why are you crusty old colostomy
bags refusing to step it up?!

384
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,458
Hm, Well, if a
customized Karin body pillow

385
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,625
were in the offering,

386
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,333
the "thing" could
be made accessible.

387
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,958
You nasty perv! How 'bout I

388
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,166
customize your
face with my foot--

389
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,583
Accessible?

390
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,291
From this point
forward, Lady Mikuni,

391
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:50,250
you must proceed
unaided and alone.

392
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:12,875
Approach me, child.
Ascend to your glorious destiny.

393
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:47,250
When the life of someone we're
sworn to protect is jeopardized,

394
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:50,708
we misstep all too easily.
Thus profound connections

395
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:52,791
between fellow
travelers are forged,

396
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:55,416
bridging depths
even darker than loss.

397
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
Next time: "Eternal Bonds"
