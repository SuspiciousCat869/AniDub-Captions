1
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,541
We just sealed
the deal with Taiwan.

2
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,375
Three cheers for profit!

3
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,083
Karin!

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,791
Enough is enough, okay?!
How can you keep exploiting

5
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,083
the market when your
country's in a crisis?!

6
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,958
With the usual dash of pride.

7
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,833
But people are dying over there!

8
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,166
People die every day.

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,500
Karin!

10
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:38,708
Zhang?

11
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,791
Zhang is now banned
from the network.

12
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,666
Distractions from the task
at hand cannot be indulged.

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,958
No time for losers!

14
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,541
We're in this to make money.

15
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,375
Bleeding-heart
pansies need not apply.

16
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,916
Kuniko! You read me?!

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,041
Yeah. Go ahead.

18
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,666
Those assholes
did a number on us!

19
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,500
Huh? Where'd the
Diet Building go?

20
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:42,083
Don't tell me.
More of their bullshit.

21
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,166
Kuniko!

22
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,375
Momoko!

23
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,083
Oh, thank God!
Thought you were a goner!

24
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,708
Wait what is that?

25
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,333
Poison gas.

26
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,583
Our scientists are
analyzing it as we speak.

27
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,666
Could this be part
of the Metal Age attack?

28
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,041
Use of chemical weaponry
is strictly forbidden

29
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,958
under international law.

30
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,333
The world will hit Japan
with penalties that'll

31
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,833
catapult our carbon
debt into the stratosphere.

32
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:16,958
I can see that putting a
"crimp" in Atlas's construction.

33
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:20,416
Well, Ryoko? Your move.

34
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,958
This is prime minister
of Japan, Ryoko Naruse.

35
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:30,000
If the terrorist leader is
present... please speak up.

36
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,625
Right here!

37
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:38,666
I'm the new leader
of Metal Age! Kuniko Hojo!

38
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,458
I see you decided to
ditch the fascist uniform.

39
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,083
What'sa matter, warden?
Tired of dress-up?

40
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,250
Whatever do you mean?
You must be delusional.

41
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,208
The two of us
have never met before.

42
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:52,291
How come you're using
gas on us like a coward?!

43
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,750
Our conventional
weaponry was making

44
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,375
easy work of your forces,

45
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,375
so why would we risk
U.N. anctions on vermin?

46
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,416
You're saying that
there's some third player

47
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,583
on the board that
neither side knows about?

48
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,708
Tell me. For how long
will you keep this up?

49
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:16,166
This plague of mindless
slaughter weighs on me.

50
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,708
Your fellow terrorists
are still valued citizens.

51
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:22,208
To which end,
I propose a cease-fire.

52
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,041
Lying out of her ass.

53
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:27,958
We're "valued citizens,"
huh?! Cut the crap.

54
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:31,291
I can have that entire section
destroyed, if you'd rather.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,041
Yeah, right.
You're gonna bomb Atlas.

56
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,333
That isn't a bluff.
She would do it.

57
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,583
If I might interject.

58
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,250
I will take
things over from here.

59
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,583
My name is Sergei Tarsian.

60
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:51,083
I serve as an arbitrator
for the U.N.'s Court of Justice.

61
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,500
I have authority
to settle this matter.

62
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,375
Arbitrator?

63
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,375
I'll frame the terms to
the rebel leader very simply.

64
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,666
If you agree to
lay down your weapons,

65
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,333
I will guarantee the
safety of you and your men.

66
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,916
If you don't, more will die.

67
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,833
I looked at the facts

68
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,916
of this case closely
before heading here.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,666
Thus, I've already
come to a decision.

70
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,583
As the aggressor in this matter,

71
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,916
Metal Age is to lay
down its arms and withdraw.

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,583
Don't worry, Kuniko! This
asshole ain't fooling anybody!

73
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,500
If you looked at
the facts, arbitrator,

74
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,583
then you know things
boiled over like this

75
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,166
because of what
Atlas has done!

76
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,958
Metal Age...

77
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,583
will comply.

78
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:55,750
But, the Japanese government
is not blameless in this.

79
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,791
For the next three years,
therefore, the government will

80
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,750
slow the pace of its
greenification project,

81
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,791
working instead
on the refugee crisis.

82
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,500
We shall do our best.

83
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,291
That's bullshit!

84
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,333
You think we're
just gonna go home?!

85
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,666
That's enough!

86
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:15,000
Put down your weapons, you
guys. I want you to withdraw.

87
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:19,000
I know you don't want to, but
please everyone, hear me out.

88
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,416
If we tell the U.N. to get bent,

89
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,125
the world is gonna
turn its back on Japan.

90
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,583
I don't believe this.

91
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,833
And if that happens,
the people outside are gonna be

92
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,375
even worse off
than they are right now.

93
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,291
I realized we hoped for better.

94
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,833
But for now,
I call for a full retreat.

95
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,750
Forgive me. Please.

96
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,458
Very well.
We're done here for today.

97
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,125
Uh, right.

98
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:01,250
"Arbitrator,"
my pert little ass!

99
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,708
Come on. Chrome-dome
was totally in cahoots

100
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,041
with that sadistic bitch.

101
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,166
Hey, Momoko.

102
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,666
Yeah?

103
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,291
Do you remember how we
got out, that time with the IDs?

104
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,791
Huh?

105
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,500
Hell no! No surrender!
I'm not giving up!

106
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,625
Hey, man. Just calm down.

107
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,333
You don't wanna do this!

108
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,125
Yeah?

109
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,000
C'mon, hand it over!

110
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,416
You back the fuck up!

111
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,916
That's enough!

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,333
You think you're hurtin'?
Then what the hell ya think

113
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,916
Kuniko's going
through right about now?!

114
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,041
Where'd she go?

115
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,458
Couldn't tell ya. But she was
on that ledge just a minute ago.

116
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,083
Zhat so?

117

Yasuko! C'mere!

Here I am.
What did you want, mister?

136
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,833
Here! Happy Birthday!

137
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,791
Wow Really?!
I get to have 'em?!

138
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,166
'Course you do.

139
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,333
Aw, thank you, Mr. Takehiko!

140
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,458
You're a riot. Callin' me
mister when I'm your brother.

00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,375
I gotta 'cause
you're my older brother!

142
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,750
They told me that you ran away!

143
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,833
Please forgive me, Yasko!

144
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,666
All this time.
I've been helping them.

145
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,250
They've all been what?

146
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,083
Bought. Somebody snatched up

147
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,791
all the high
carbon-debt areas worldwide.

148
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,666
What do you think?
Did someone purposely block

149
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,500
our head leases,
to screw with us?

150
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,583
Totes! I looked
into the money trail,

151
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,708
and don't go freaking
out now but it's Zhang!

152
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,000
Come on! Zhang's never had

153
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,083
the kinda cash-flow
to pull that off!

154
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,750
He does now!
He's probably just being a dick

155
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,458
'cause we kicked him off the
team! So what do we do huh?!

156
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,125
Beat him at his own game.

157
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,958
He's gonna rue messing
with Team Medusa!

158
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,291
Hey! Don't you die on me!

159
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:59,083
Oh no. So she lost?

160
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,000
This glorious pillar of heaven.

161
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,250
Who shall stand atop it?

162
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,750
We'll soon find out. Won't we?

163
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,375
Level Four, right?

164
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:15,041
Yup! Atlas's resident
residential block.

165
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,750
It's just as huge
as all the rest.

166
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,583
Fresh fish, right here!
Come an' get it!

167
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,333
Check it out!
Those look awesome!

168
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,625
We are a bit grubby.

169
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,791
So, why'd you wanna
come back here, anyway?

170
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,416
No reason!

171
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,416
Didn't feel like going home yet.

172
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,125
So we might as well see the
sights, as long as we're here.

173
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,625
Okay...

174
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,583
Look at 'em, Momoko!

175
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,166
Houses here are gigantic!

176
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,541
What are those sphere dealies?

177
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,166
Maybe we should go!

178
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,333
Hey! You there!

179
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,916
Yeah. I got a hunch your
IDs ain't exactly in order.

180
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,208
Oh, come on!

181
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,125
It's those two. Let's get 'em!

182
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,250
What are you doing there?

183
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,416
I know we look suspicious
and grubby, but we're not.

184
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,166
Really! Grubby, yeah

185
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,375
Ma'am, we're desperate!

186
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,916
Some very questionable
men are on our tail!

187
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,208
Huh?!

188
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,458
They're not here?!

189
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,708
Yes, sir. Looking at our
records, I'm not able to find

190
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,125
any sailors who're
staying here at the moment.

191
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,250
What do you mean?!

192
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,625
Those men and
I were all admitted

193
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,333
to the hospital together!

194
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:42,125
I'm sorry, but they're
not in the system, sir.

195
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:48,500
My goodness. The two
of you had quite a scare.

196
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:52,041
It was awful! Had their
fun and refused to pay us!

197
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,291
The things they did
to my little friend here!

198
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,666
When I think of how
they stole his virtue!

199
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,166
Wait, so your friend is a--?

200
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,333
Lady-boy! And a hooker.

201
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,666
Ah-ha. I'll help you
two out however I can.

202
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,625
Bless you-- You're a gem.

203
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:12,291
By the way, my name
is Momoko. This here is Kuniko.

204
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:16,375
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Haruko. Now drink up.

205
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,458
Thank you, Haruko.

206
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,875
whose arbitration
proved invaluable

207
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,750
in forging a cease-fire.
Which, of course,

208
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,208
led to the
terrorists' disarmament

209
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,666
and subsequent withdrawal.

210
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,416
All that war-talk
turns my stomach.

211
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:30,333
My boy's an army officer.
Fortunately, he isn't the type

212
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,791
to take his work home with him.

213
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,416
As a mother, you must worry.

214
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,750
Call me superstitious,

215
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,041
but I make him carry
a family heirloom for luck.

216
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,875
I wonder why...

217
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,166
Why folks feel like they
have to fight to begin with?

218
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,708
Honestly? Part of me
thinks the boys like to go

219
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,791
to war to get their rocks off.

220
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,625
I do hear things,
though, about how tough

221
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:54,666
they have it on the outside.
Even the rain is lethal.

222
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,666
I'm sure I'd be angry too,
if I were stuck out there.

223
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,125
But Atlas is letting 'em all in

224
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,875
just as fast as
they can or so they say.

225
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,375
Well, at least the
fighting is over for now.

226
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,333
Uh-huh. And it's
a blessing that the

227
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,583
residential level
didn't take any damage.

228
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,708
Well, guess I
should start dinner.

229
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,958
Oh! I'll give you a hand.

230
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,833
You're a guest.
Don't worry about it.

231
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,166
Now, I wouldn't dream
of letting you do it all.

232
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,208
Singapore and Shanghai
just got bought out!

233
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,916
Please help me, Karin! The
water level continues to rise!

234
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,333
The Chongqing
head lease has failed.

235
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:34,791
All capital is exhausted. Karin.
Ishida Finance is bankrupt.

236
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,208
Bankrupt? We can't be!

237
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,708
I'm very grateful
for the help, Asian Dragon.

238
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,125
I see the stories of a
'leet old-school carbon-trader

239
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,000
are more than just tall tales.

240
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,458
So, is this
really what you wanted?

241
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,041
I'm all for making money,
but exploiting this crisis

242
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,291
just wasn't
sitting right with me.

243
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,000
Besides, Medusa was
getting out of control.

244
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,833
Carbon rates were losing
any real-world meaning.

245
00:14:58,708 --> 00:14:59,833
I knew that letting it go on

246
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,125
unchecked would
have been too risky.

247
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,375
You are a clever young man.

248
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,541
Fare thee well, Karin.

249
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,958
I'm leaving the
carbon-trader's life for good.

250
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm running off to a convent,
to spend the rest of my days

251
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:18,583
in chaste contemplation
as Sister Mary Robert. Amen.

252
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,833
"Don't give up, Karin.
You can't throw in the towel

253
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,375
just 'cause you
hit a little snag."

254
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:36,458
"It can't end, not like this!
All you need is some more money,

255
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,541
and you're golden!
After that, there's nothing

256
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:42,416
you can't
accomplish. Trust me!"

257
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,791
No quitting.

258
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,125
Not without a fight!

259
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,958
"So step one is to
raise some new capital?"

260
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,916
I can get us all
the money we need.

261
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,250
I'll wring every screed from
Zeus, and laugh while I do it.

262
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,250
"Ooh, the Japanese treasury?"

263
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,708
If I max out Medusa's
survival instinct

264
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,041
and disable its
need for a human handler,

265
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,583
it should become
completely unstoppable!

266
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:10,083
"You're switching top user
priority over to Medusa itself?"

267
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,708
Yeah! There's no way it can

268
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,083
outmaneuver Zeus if
I'm the one in charge.

269
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,708
But I know Medusa
can crunch the numbers

270
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,166
super-fast if it's on its own!

271
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,500
Now go forth!

272
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,416
Raid Japan's coffers
and bring it all back to me!

273
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,125
What seems to
be the trouble?

274
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:30,208
Another cyber-security
breach. Zeus is under attack.

275
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:33,791
Unidentified as of yet.
But I would wager it's Medusa.

276
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,041
Really?

277
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,583
Lengthening number-strings
one-million-fold.

278
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,333
Once again, the most sensitive
sectors are being targeted.

279
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,291
Madam, they're
hitting all the areas

280
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,500
that were weakened
by Sayoko's attack.

281
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,333
The top-secret files
will soon be compromised.

282
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:54,083
We cannot allow that
information to be made public.

283
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:57,875
We must shut down Zeus.

284
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,291
If we do, then our defense
system will go offline.

285
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,666
Atlas will be a
gigantic sitting duck.

286
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,916
All of our other vital systems
will be taken offline, as well.

287
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,500
Also, every scrap of government
data will be deleted--

288
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,125
Our secrets take precedence.

289
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:18,041
Now do as I have
ordered you to. Shut it down.

290
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:22,541
I have given you an order! Obey
or I will have you arrested!

291
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,125
What is the meaning of this?

292
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:27,416
Zeus's survival outweighs
your dusty secrets.

293
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,708
And speaking of your secrets,
I discovered that you took

294
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,750
few young carbon-traders
under your wing

295
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,625
and had them create Medusa.

296
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:49,833
The great serpent! The serpent
has opened the sacred doorway.

297
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:56,875
And the spirit. The spirit
must be protecteeeeeed!

298
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,166
Lord Hiruko!

299
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,083
I have located
the password phrases.

300
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,541
Please enter them
within the next ten seconds.

301
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,833
"O Sun, illuminate the
heavens and the earth alike.

302
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:08,083
O Moon, climb the sky-- Dispel
the o'er arcing darkness."

303
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,750
And "O Land. Enthrall
the day and the night

304
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,708
and hold thee
sway upon the world."

305
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,208
The marionette
who cuts her strings

306
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,541
will find herself immobilized.

307
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:21,041
You old fool, you still
think you're the puppeteer?

308
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,083
One more keystroke and bam!

309
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,333
Huh? Hold on.

310
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:34,875
What in the--?
I just hacked into Atlas?!

311
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,541
She runs as fast as she hacks.

312
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,166
Chicken stew is my
boy's favorite dinner.

313
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,750
Clean your plate, sweet cheeks.

314
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:13,166
Man, all those carrots.
Thanks for the food, ma'am

315
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,750
You're just in time!

316
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,208
It's good to be home.

317
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,000
Go and change
out of your uniform.

318
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,375
We have folks over for dinner.

319
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,625
It's a pleasure
to meet you-- Ahhh!

320
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,833
What? What are
you two doing here?

321
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:35,208
Uh, your last name
isn't Kusanagi, is it?

322
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,583
Yeah. I guess
I forgot to tell you?

323
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,083
Uh-huh.

324
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,833
Have you met Kunihito? He
looked as though he knew you.

325
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:45,041
We've crossed paths
a couple o' times.

326
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,833
Hey, grumpy.
Change out of your duds

327
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,000
and at least come say hello.

328
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:01,791
Kuniko and Momoko tell
me you guys've met before.

329
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,458
Some bad men are
giving them trouble.

330
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,250
Be a good boy and
help them out, would you?

331
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,375
Once again, my son has come
home to me, safe and sound.

332
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,916
Thank you for protecting him.

333
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,833
Pictures of young Nagiko?

334
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,416
I'm guessing they were fake.

335
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,208
This whole place
is smoke and mirrors.

336
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,791
Dunno, maybe... still...

337
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,750
Is that why you don't
wanna go home yet?

338
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,875
That's not why-- Not really.

339
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,208
I needed some time
to think about stuff.

340
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:34,583
Plus, I was curious to
see how they live in Atlas.

341
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,166
But all of it
seems pretty normal.

342
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,541
I dunno. They've got
it pretty good here.

343
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:42,250
They do. But they don't
realize what it's like outside,

344
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,250
so it's no big deal to 'em.

345
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,875
And those that do,
they're just glad they

346
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,416
dodged the bullet an'
it's not them out there.

347
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,333
Welcome to human
nature, my darling.

348
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:26,083
It was tasty. Y'know,
that stew your mom made.

349
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:30,208
Cooked like that, carrots
aren't the worst thing ever.

350
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,875
How do you fight like that?

351
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,083
Huh?

352
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,125
It's like you never
seem to feel any doubt.

353
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,625
Like you never have
to question what's right.

354
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:42,000
It's like, everything you
believe in hasn't crumbled away.

355
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:46,958
I wish I felt like that.

356
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,583
So do I.

357
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:53,916
I've got so many
doubts. Same as you.

358
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:03,208
Who are you?
How dare you barge in here?!

359
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:06,583
You'll answer to me if you
harm one hair on milady's head!

360
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:10,083
Tetsuo Kumagai.
You are under arrest.

361
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:13,375
Wait. What? You mean me?!

362
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:47,166
Winning the Atlas Lottery,
getting to serve you,

363
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,083
it's been like a dream.

364
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:53,208
If it was, I preferred
it to all the waking moments.

365
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,458
Thank you for this, Milady.

366
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,750
Next time: "Forest Frenzy"
