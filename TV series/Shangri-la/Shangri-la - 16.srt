1
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:24,708
Kumagai? And what
is their significance?

2
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,500
A favored member of
Digma One's entourage.

3
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,666
Also known as "Miiko." 

4
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,083
Ah, the sexually confused one.

5
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,458
And what is the charge?

6
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,791
I'll leave that
to your discretion.

7
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,958
Get creative if you like.

8
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,375
As long as our little
nightshade is grieving the loss

9
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:45,541
of her clown, I'll be more than
content, for the time being.

10
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,791
Miiko.

11
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:05,583
It appears Lord Hiruko's current
vessel is waning rather rapidly.

12
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:08,916
These days he does
seem a bit more, voracious.

13
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:13,666
Here's a lark.
Let's use the airsot's maiden.

14
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,958
Ma'am?

15
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,125
Several would fit
into a vessel of that size.

16
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:18,416
I beg your pardon,

17
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,125
but I believe a pure
maiden is what's required.

18
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,291
Come now. He claims
to have the pure soul

19
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:25,458
of a maiden,
if not the natural body.

20
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:30,333
I wonder what Tarsian's response
to our unique choice will be.

21
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:33,666
My curiosity is piqued
to say the very least.

22
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,958
Our friends are leaving,.
Don't be so antisocial.

23
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,625
Come say goodbye.

24
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,083
How can someone who pulls a gun

25
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:18,083
on their own countrymen
call himself a soldier?

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,541
Forgive his rudeness.

27
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:24,708
Water off a duck's back.
You've been a fabulous host.

28
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,875
So what now?
More sightseeing perhaps?

29
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,041
I'm done.
It's all just same taste,

30
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,708
different smell around here.

31
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:36,875
More people who'll see us as

32
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,458
some "interesting story"
they saw on TV.

33
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,500
All just so content,
they couldn't give a damn

34
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,916
about us struggling
on the outside.

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,666
You can't take careless
words to heart, love.

36
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,333
I know that. I'm not stupid.

37
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,875
So what's your plan?

38
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:56,458
I don't know just yet.
I gotta go back home and think.

39
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,458
That's plan enough for now.

40
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,208
What the hell?
We got no leader,

41
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:06,000
we got no goddamn direction!
We ain't got shit!

42
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:09,500
Metal Age got kicked right
square in the damn balls.

43
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,166
It's game over, for real man.

44
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,083
Game on! Not game over!

45
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,958
She's comin' back and it's gonna
be better than ever before!

46
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,875
Oh yeah? Well, I don't see her!

47
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,458
It's like somebody died.

48
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:23,625
It's exactly like that.
Except it was their dream.

49
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,541
They had to give up
what they were fighting for.

50
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,625
What in the heck
happened to Kuniko anyway?

51
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,958
I bet she finally just got tired
of the whole "leader" thing.

52
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,000
That's a lotta crap
for a girl to deal with.

53
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,625
I couldn't hang
with it for that long.

54
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:42,375
Hey now. You don't have
to drag me down to your level.

55
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,375
Did ya miss me?

56
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,708
Totally!

57
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,916
But seriously.
Sorry I made you guys worry.

58
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,416
Look who's come back!
Hey, everyone!

59
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,291
Kuniko finally
found her way back home!

60
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,458
That's great news!

61
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,458
It's Kuniko!

62
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,708
Well, It's about time!

63
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:04,625
That's a mercy!

64
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,583
Yeah, it's true! I'm ba-ack!

65
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,083
Welcome home, Kuniko.

66
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh thank heaven,
safe and sound.

67
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:12,875
No kidding!

68
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:13,958
I guess you can tell we've all

69
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:14,833
been a little
worried about you dear.

70
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,083
You're really back!

71
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,000
I knew it!

72
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,916
Can you believe it?!

73
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,583
What did you discover in Atlas?

74
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,166
I came across an old
picture of you there, Grandma.

75
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,125
It said "First CEO,
Nagiko Hojo".

76
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,000
Is that really true?

77
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,666
I guess it is. But I
don't understand how you could

78
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,000
keep something that big
from me and everyone else.

79
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,250
No one's seen
Takehiko around lately.

80
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,791
What?

81
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,750
He returned with the others,
but shortly thereafter he seems

82
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,500
to have disappeared.
I'm afraid, he too discovered

83
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,625
a truth in Atlas
he couldn't face.

84
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,791
Grandma.

85
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,708
I've learned being
leader of this group

86
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,208
means making tough choices.

87
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:44,291
Ms. Nagiko Hojo, you are
hereby exiled from Duomo.

88
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,291
Once every day.

89
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,875
What?

90
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:01,000
Stir the bran in the
pickling bed once every day.

91
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,916
I hope I made
the right choice.

92
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,541
If that was where your heart's
counsel led you my dear girl,

93
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,166
then it had to
have been right.

94
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,208
It's like I don't
know life without 'er.

95
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,333
It's uncharted
territory for me.

96
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:49,125
How are you supposed to deal
with losing someone like this?

97
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:52,166
Miiko was like your shadow so
how'd you feel when she left?

98
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,916
Like half a set o' six
inch heels. Lopsided.

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,583
But I knew if I looked here,

100
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,750
she'd still be knocking
around inside my heart.

101
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,250
Nagiko will
always be with you.

102
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,791
She's left an
imprint that can't be

103
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,041
erased by time
or miles between.

104
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,500
You'll carry each other
with you wherever you go.

105
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,958
So keep her safe in there.

106
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,583
Come on!

107
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,708
You might wanna keep
me safe too, ya loon!

108
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:34,291
My heart told me I could fly
and we did for a second there!

109
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,583
We did. The nay-sayers
can all go to hell!

110
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,708
Believe in yourself! No one
tells the sun it can't shine!

111
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,291
That's right!

112
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,875
Please. Forgive me!
I didn't mean to, I swear!

113
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,250
Whatever I did wrong,
I truly repent!

114
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,833
Purify the heavens
and the earth.

115
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,000
Purify the within
and the without.

116
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,208
Purify the six
roots of our being.

117
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,375
Cleanse the seven days,
the nine planets,

118
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,708
and the 28 lunar houses.

119
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:17,458
Cleanse the 36 guardian
gods of this world.

120
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,625
The purification of the within
and the without is the cleansing

121
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,750
of the terrible god
of the Three Treasures,

122
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,250
living within the hearth.
Sweep away all that is unclean

123
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,625
and purify the
six roots of our being.

124
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,125
May the young deer raise
his ears to our prayer,

125
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,291
and deliver it to
the innumerable gods,

126
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:37,458
that they may grant our request.
We beg this of the divine.

127
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,791
Oh wise and exalted one, we
have been awaiting your arrival.

128
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,916
We found some over here!

129
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,291
Yeah?!

130
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,583
These things are spreading
everywhere like crazy.

131
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,625
They're callin' 'em
"Daedalus" aren't they?

132
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,875
Yeah. That's what
Tok called them, anyway.

133
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,291
Should we be here?

134
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,833
I mean like, doing stuff
with the Metal Age guys?

135
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,000
These things're dangerous
ta everyone in Duomo,

136
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,666
so we gotta chip
in to get rid of'em.

137
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,416
We're just doing
our part to help is all.

138
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,166
I'm really startin'
to like the new Tomoka.

139
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,208
Kuniko!

140
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,625
'Sup?

141
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,000
Furukawa needs
a word with you.

142
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,125
He needs to talk to me?

143
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:34,291
Seriously? These are the things
that have been shooting at us?

144
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,083
After germination.
In about ten days or so,

145
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,208
they appear like this.

146
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,625
It takes only two months
for them to reach full size.

147
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,875
Unbelievably quick.

148
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,375
So they're very eager
to stand erect are they?

149
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,666
Have you figured out why they're
able to fire like cannons?

150
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:55,083
I believe the plants in
the F2 generation used Oxygen

151
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:58,125
as their primary seed
propellant, did they not?

152
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:01,208
Correct. But several generations
have passed since then.

153
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:04,208
They now incorporate
nitrogen oxides in the process.

154
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,083
It would appear that
evolution has blessed them

155
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,791
with a very sophisticated
form of photo-oxidation.

156
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,875
So they've made
their own improvements.

157
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,791
The oxygen that the plant
creates through photosynthesis

158
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,791
is given a boost
by the excess nitrogen

159
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,666
that it absorbs
through its root system.

160
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,875
You think the poisonous
gas released on Level Eight

161
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,541
has something
to do with them too?

162
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,166
Another kind
of Daedalus attack?

163
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,291
What about the time
they fired on our smokestacks

164
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,875
and the army barged in?

165
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,875
I don't remember seeing
any gas that day, do you?

166
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,416
They originally used
oxygen to eject their seeds.

167
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,000
But now, the seeds themselves
release nitrogen oxides,

168
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,833
which allow them to
travel higher in the air

169
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,041
and reach a
greater distance on land.

170
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,208
It seems this gas was
released at the same time

171
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:45,375
they reached Level Eight and,
in turn, leaked into Atlas.

172
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,041
We thought their
natural attraction to heat

173
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,666
would accelerate the
greenification process.

174
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,333
But it seems they've gone and
developed a mind of their own.

175
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,875
So this whole thing was
genetically engineered.

176
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,458
By Atlas Corp?

177
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:00,750
Just another weapon created
to cause pain and destruction.

178
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,166
We gotta wipe em out.

179
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,333
Let them have their way.
As long as we keep the amount

180
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,291
of heat we put off under
control, we'll be fine.

181
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,375
Leave the
worrying to the outliers.

182
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,333
Another test of their resolve.

183
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,625
Speaking of the outliers,
we've lost contact with

184
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,166
number thirteen
in the past few days.

185
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,958
Due to his
involvement in the skirmish

186
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,041
it's possible that
he is now a casualty.

187
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,458
Oh?

188
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,750
Kusanagi!

189
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,000
The word's going
around the base that

190
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,291
you resigned your commission.

191
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:39,958
Yep.

192
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,708
But why?

193
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,791
I dunno. Something
in the wind I guess.

194
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,375
Nah. More like the sun.

195
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,000
What in the holy hell
is that supposed to mean?

196
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,000
Hey! Kusanagi!

197
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,125
What is it?

198
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,708
It appears Digma Three
has tendered his resignation.

199
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:07,625
Why is that any of my concern?
Let him do as he pleases.

200
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,291
After all, he's only
third in the ranking.

201
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:19,708
No, we mustn't.
Tears are foolish things.

202
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,916
They bring no
salve to our spirit.

203
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,958
Prepare for us
a carriage at once!

204
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,458
Milady, where will you go?

205
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,750
We must make speed
to the heart of Atlas.

206
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,958
To wrest back our dear
companion by dint of force.

207
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,541
What will be thy choice?
Defiance shall be punished

208
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:37,083
by death and obedience
rewarded with Atlas rank!

209
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,250
Sweet mother of pearl!

210
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,375
Can you believe how fast
it's grown since the last time?

211
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,125
Crazy.

212
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,500
Holy crap!

213
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,125
I never imagined
they could get that big.

214
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,750
It's enough to make
a decent woman blush.

215
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,458
Let's burn 'em down!

216
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,333
Oh my! Look there!

217
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,375
Get outta here!

218
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,750
What now?

219
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,416
Please forgive the intrusion.

220
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,041
But Digma One has decided to

221
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,833
mount an armed
attack upon Atlas.

222
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,666
You don't say.

223
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,416
She is demanding the immediate
return of Tetsuo Kumagai.

224
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,583
All this to-do for a queer?

225
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,666
Such misguided heroism,

226
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,083
sacrificing others for
her ridiculous plaything.

227
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,625
Fear not Miiko!

228
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,708
What is the matter?
The gunmen ceased their fire,

229
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:04,500
but we gave not the order!
Continue firing, now!

230
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:20,166
It is she. The witch.

231
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,916
That's quite enough. Stop
this foolish parade at once!

232
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,166
Make haste!
Our enemy is before us!

233
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,791
Is there not one
warrior among thee

234
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,375
possessed of the
courage to strike?!

235
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:36,791
Slay her now! Slay her
and name thy reward!

236
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,833
A valiant effort.
But know even death trembles

237
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,125
in my presence
and bends to my will.

238
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,541
You ask proof of this?

239
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,041
The gun refuses to fire.

240
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,291
For even instruments of war

241
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,333
dare not defy the
force of my destiny.

242
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,000
What strange sanctum is this?

243
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,833
This is where the Chief
Executive Officer of Atlas,

244
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,875
Lord Hiruko, makes his home.

245
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,375
Hiruko? Our explicit desire
was to lay eyes on Miiko!

246
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,000
And so you shall.
The two have intertwined.

247
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,208
A selfless act of servitude.

248
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:38,333
The moon child has
entered my chamber!

249
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,291
Miss Mikuni.
I beg you, stay away!

250
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,291
That voice! Miiko!

251
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:51,916
Oh how we've longed for thee!

252
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,875
Your flesh! You come
that I may dine upon it?!

253
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,291
Sweet Miiko. Thou art changed.

254
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:01,083
No, made sacrifice
so I may be born anew.

255
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,291
Stop! I will not allow
you to harm Miss Mikuni!

256
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:09,083
Silence vessel, and know
thy rightful place as servant!

257
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,666
Miss Mikuni.

258
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,666
Miiko, 'tis truly thee.

259
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,833
Please my lady.
Your magnificent robes

260
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,333
will become damp and soiled.

261
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:30,041
That matters not to us. We
have longed to hold thee near.

262
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:33,916
Listen to me. The one you
once knew as Miiko is no more.

263
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,666
Leave me be and
do not return here.

264
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,541
Bearing witness to
the unconditional love

265
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,000
for which you've
shown me today

266
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,458
truly fills my soul
with overwhelming joy.

267
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,083
As certain as we
see thee, thou art Miiko.

268
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,250
Whate'er corporeal
form enshrouds thee,

269
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,583
thy spirit remains pure.

270
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,791
My eyes well up, fit to burst.

271
00:17:57,083 --> 00:18:01,958
Now, little nightshade. It's
time to bid your slave farewell.

272
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,750
When I said I wanted
to get a little action,

273
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,500
this is not at
all what I meant.

274
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,625
How come they weren't this nuts
when we first came across 'em?

275
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,583
It seems firing at them
was a bit of a faux pas.

276
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,666
Plants communicate ya know.

277
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,583
They speak to each other
in a language made up

278
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,458
entirely of chemical signals.

279
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,166
So by introducing
the chemicals from

280
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,666
the flamethrowers into the air,
we essentially kicked off

281
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,000
an argument that's escalated
into an all-out brawl.

282
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,166
And now they're
all so worked up

283
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,500
and turned on they
can't stop popping off.

284
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,125
Ugh. You always sound so dirty.

285
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,166
How in the heck do you know
so much about plants, anyway?

286
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,291
It's my former life,
sweet cheeks.

287
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:40,375
Not only did I once aspire to be
a woman, but a botanist as well.

288
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,916
You went to college
for it? What happened?

289
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,958
I spent too
much time at the bars.

290
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,000
You've never
been much to look at.

291
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,916
But it seems as
though these past few days

292
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,625
have been exceedingly harsh.

293
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,166
Make so much as one more move

294
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,291
and I'll show you
just how harsh I can be.

295
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,666
I said don't move!

296
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,750
I have no reservations about
killing your precious oracle.

297
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:08,833
Sayoko! Thou
musn't harm Miiko!

298
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,125
You feel it?

299
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,250
Yes. This child keeps
the gremlins at bay.

300
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,333
The only way to control
the forces that would send

301
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:18,708
your world tumbling is by
supplying him with fresh souls!

302
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:22,083
Good. That's exactly
what you should do.

303
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,875
Stay where you are.
Come along now Lady Mikuni.

304
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,125
Yes!

305
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:33,375
Lady Mikuni will assume
her role as heir now, yes?

306
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,541
That decision
lies with Zeus alone.

307
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:39,000
We shall take our leave
of Atlas until it is so.

308
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,333
Sayoko!

309
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,666
You mustn't worry. I would
never lead you astray.

310
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,541
Let them go!

311
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:50,875
But, my lady!

312
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,083
These vibrations
will destroy Atlas!

313
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:57,041
Ah well. Hiruko is
nothing but a toy for Tarsian.

314
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,375
We can manage without him.

315
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,458
Quite a bold move, Sayoko.

316
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:05,458
You've exceeded my expectations.
Keep getting more involved.

317
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:09,291
It will only lead you
deeper and deeper into misery.

318
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,791
Looks like Kuniko
and the others are back!

319
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,583
Are you okay?

320
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:17,666
Yeah.

321
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,125
What happened?
Everyone make it?

322
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,916
If any of you are hurt,

323
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,875
come back to my
place and we'll play doctor.

324
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,791
Huh? What was that, dear?

325
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,916
I asked what you'd like
me to whip up in the kitchen?

326
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,625
Yes, Kuniko and the boys have
returned from their mission!

327
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:48,708
Alright! Canned tuna
and panko sounds good to me!

328
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,750
These massive hail
storms are to blame for it.

329
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,500
Whaddya mean?

330
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,833
They attacked the
trees, gave them the beating

331
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:02,125
of their lives and left them
broken. With the branches gone,

332
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,000
all those sunbeams
were finally able to

333
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,125
touch the once forbidden earth.

334
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,708
Ahh, time to
soak up some rays! Huh?

335
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,958
What the--?
What's going on here?!

336
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,000
The daedalus
rise up lightning-fast.

337
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,541
Hogging all the suns rays
and nutrients from the ground

338
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,833
before the other
plants even have a chance.

339
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:26,208
The Daedalus shoot their seeds.
The hail falls from the sky.

340
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,083
More daedalus grow.
Wash, rinse, repeat.

341
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,583
After a while, what
began as a diverse forest

342
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,708
becomes one giant monoculture.

343
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:34,916
What's that mean?

344
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,208
Nothing in it but the Daedalus.

345
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:58,500
A whole forest overrun with
this stuff is not gonna be good.

346
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,750
Our future's
basically forfeit unle--

347
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:05,958
Your future's basically
forfeit either way.

348
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,333
I used to be just like you.
I had people I cared about.

349
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:51,500
People I thought I
could protect. Not any more.

350
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:54,166
Now, I have absolutely nothing.

351
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,500
Next time: "A Dark
Night's Resistance"
