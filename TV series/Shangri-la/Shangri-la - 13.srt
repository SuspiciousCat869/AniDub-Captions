1
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:22,333
It's her song and dance.

2
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,916
The wind ought to blow
where it damn-well pleases.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,166
The ol' girl's a battle axe.
I'm sure she can cope.

4
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:32,125
All I want for you, sweet pea,
is whatever makes you happiest.

5
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,000
If you just want to
be a normal teenage girl,

6
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,791
then knock yourself out.

7
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,500
Are you the leader of Metal Age?

8
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:41,625
Uh, well.
Technically speaking, no.

9
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,083
And yet you make a
big show of cat-calling us!

10
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,666
Look, it's kind of a
complicated issue, okay?

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,666
'm not part of
Metal Age. Except, I--

12
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,500
Stand there and tell
me with a straight face

13
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,041
terrorists have helped.

14
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:58,250
You kill trees. Steal property.
Burn whatever you feel like.

15
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,791
Look, I'm... I'm not--

16
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,333
Naw, I get ya.
Things are rough all over.

17
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:04,416
Don't go thinkin' this has

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,291
anything to do
with Metal Age, either.

19
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,958
'course not. Look at you.

20
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:12,125
You're a perfectly
normal teenage girl, right?

21
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,625
I've been thinking
a lot about power.

22
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:19,083
Like, what I might have
the power actually to change.

23
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,250
I've seen a lot of craziness.

24
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:24,875
And the more I see, the less
I feel able to do anything.

25
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:28,791
The less I feel like
we have a real shot.

26
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,833
Listen, this isn't about
revenge.

27
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:33,458
For what they did to
Momoko or my friends in juvie.

28
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,500
I want to make
sure you know that.

29
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:39,166
My mind was made up
before any of that happened.

30
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,375
It's just. I wasn't
sure I was right.

31
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,958
I mean, you know, for this.

32
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:51,500
Now I know. I will
be Metal Age's leader.

33
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,541
From behind the trees and
the voracious green tendrils

34
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,750
that strangle
our homes, we fight.

35
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,000
Against those who'd turn
a blind eye on their neighbors

36
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,291
in the midst of
suffering, we fight.

37
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,625
We squandered
too much time asking.

38
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:13,083
We must demand change!
The place we once called home

39
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,666
is nothing but a
crumbling mass of ruins.

40
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,250
A toxic waste dump.

41
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,750
We have been patient,
we have been pure,

42
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,083
and our reward is
a boot to the face.

43
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,833
We are treated like beggars.

44
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:27,750
We stand, huddled at the gates
of paradise, hands outstretched,

45
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,833
and those with the
power to ease our lot,

46
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,000
refuse us even their scraps.

47
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,875
If they cannot deign to honor
our humanity and our right

48
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,708
to live in peace,
we will pry our due from them

49
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,916
by any and all means necessary.
We will take what we are owed.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,958
We will take Atlas.

51
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,958
Today we will
fight for our future.

52
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,375
What's at stake here is nothing
less than our very survival.

53
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,791
Today we go to war.

54
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:41,125
Hey, easy. Just because those
things ain't armed right now,

55
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,875
doesn't mean you can go an'toss
'em around like potato sacks.

56
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:47,708
Who knew? Beneath that fuzz and
muscle you're a nervous Nelly.

57
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:51,250
Can it, squirt! Wanna
know some words to live by?

58
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,500
"Keep your cool
and keep your head."

59
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,166
You know I love "head".

60
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,333
How about I give you a
bullet in the ass, ya queen?

61
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:01,333
Oh yeah. I knew you
liked the rough stuff.

62
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,875
You're having entirely
too much fun out here!

63
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,208
Thought you'd come!

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,250
Miss President.

65
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,250
Uh, yes, ma'am?!

66
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,750
Whatever you may
discover on your mission,

67
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,625
you must face it
without trepidation.

68
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,875
I'm gonna take back our future.
So no one has to be afraid!

69
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,916
Yeah!

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,291
Shhh! Shhh! Shhh!

71
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,125
There, there.

72
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:42,416
Aw, don't cry.
We didn't mean to wake you.

73
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:48,250
I'll make sure you
have a home. I promise!

74
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,416
Ya know why the
chief advisor would come

75
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
all the way to
Japan so suddenly?

76
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,958
I'm completely in the dark.
The whole operation's been

77
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,750
outta whack since the
president became prime minister.

78
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:30,125
I--I do hope your journey here
was a pleasant one Mr. Tarsian.

79
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,041
I apologize for
our unpreparedness but

80
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,625
due to the sudden nature of--

81
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,000
I never knew the
Americans used to have

82
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,833
a military base way out here.

83
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,208
Well, what you don't
know could fill a book, huh?

84
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,208
Driver. Address our
leader as Miss President!

85
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,208
Shut up.
You're about as much of

86
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,000
a Metal Age member
as you are a chick.

87
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,791
Hey now. The reason
I came was to keep an eye

88
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:59,791
on my sweet daddy bear, and he
just bites my head right off.

89
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,750
Yeah, well. You better
hope I'm in this good of a mood

90
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,666
when I got some
live ammo in the chamber.

91
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,500
What?!

92
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,416
Hey look! We're here, guys!

93
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:29,083
I assume you're K.D.? My name is
Kuniko Hojo. Head of Metal Age.

94
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,958
Pleased to meet you.

95
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:38,041
Oh-kay. I'm guessing KD
stands for something, eh?

96
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,333
Those weird old bastards
briefed me on everything,

97
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:43,500
so let's get on
with it. Follow me please.

98
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,250
He's no contender
for Miss Congeniality.

99
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,291
Go on, Miss President.

100
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,291
Uh. Yeah, right.

101
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,166
Whoa! Huge boomerang!

102
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,041
Nice!

103
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,166
She may look like a relic,

104
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,916
but the ol' girl's
tough as they come.

105
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,250
NCT-processed reinforced
aluminum from stem to stern.

106
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,416
Not only that,
she's modded for stealth.

107
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,666
If they do spot us,

108
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,375
the custom-built Union
power plant engines'll

109
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,291
have us outta
harm's way in a blink.

110
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,208
She'll give those
Air Force Shinshin jets

111
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,083
a run for their money for sure.

112
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,916
Wow.

113
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,791
And you're gonna
be our pilot, right?

114
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,375
Sure you feel comfortable
trusting your lives

115
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,333
to man whose name
you don't know, little missy?

116
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,000
What is your deal?

117
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,708
My life is in your
hands, sir. Not only mine,

118
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,083
but the lives of countless
others whose survival depends

119
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,666
on the success
of our mission today.

120
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,708
Well that's a real
honorable little spiel

121
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:43,791
ya got workin' there.

122
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:44,875
Sure do hope you
don't expect me to give

123
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,625
more than two
shits about all that.

124
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,083
Huh?

125
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,625
But I'll guarantee you this.

126
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,583
You pay me to do a job and I
am gonna damn-well do it right.

127
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,791
That's really all I care about.

128
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,250
We've had enough!
We demand an end to

129
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,166
the inhumane
treatment inflicted on us

130
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,041
by the ATLAS
corporation starting today!

131
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,166
What? Stand down immediately!

132
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,583
Don't you realize
if you do this,

133
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,500
you'll never get
to live in Atlas?!

134
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,916
Try living in the slums
and tell me how you like it!

135
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,541
You idiots! What
you're doing is treason!

136
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,083
Oh, you ain't
seen nothin' yet pal!

137
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,083
It's time! Now!

138
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,250
Yeah!

139
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,416
What the hell's
gotten into them?

140
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,000
We're not equipped
to handle this alone!

141
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,208
Where is our backup?!

142
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,750
Phase one underway! Our forces
have engaged the enemy

143
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,416
in the Level One
Construction Zones

144
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,125
and also in the first
sector of Megashaft number nine.

145
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,750
So far according to plan.

146
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,541
Any military involvement?

147
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,625
No ground troops have
been deployed as of yet.

148
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,708
They seem to be
exercising restraint.

149
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,500
Nagiko thinks the
earlier problem with their

150
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,458
naval fleet may be
slowing them down a bit.

151
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,916
Very good. Just keep me posted.

152
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,958
Now all we gotta do is
cut off the head of the beast.

153
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,333
We got some company.

154
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,958
They're making easy work
of our defenses, it would seem.

155
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,125
The command is placing blame
on compromised radar sites,

156
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,041
but this ship does
appear to have been equipped

157
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,541
with fairly advanced
stealth capabilities.

158
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,208
There are many
cash-strapped nations willing

159
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,958
to part with military
technology for the right price.

160
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,541
You can never trust
those who're in need.

161
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,083
I say... Let's give
the Air Force commander

162
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,916
some proper motivation.

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,791
As you wish, Madam.

164
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,208
Flight Control to Crete One.
You are to treat any

165
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,625
illegal invasion of Atlas
airspace as a terrorist act.

166
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,291
If you encounter
the unknown aircraft,

167
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,666
you are authorized to use
deadly force at your discretion.

168
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,083
Roger. Flight control, out.

169
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,041
So if this goes south
they can make me the scapegoat.

170
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,375
Someone's locked on me!

171
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,666
Crete one! This is Crete two.

172
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,791
The unknown has
a lock on us, too.

173
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,875
They're messin'
with the wrong guys.

174
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,666
Unknown opening weapons
bays! Take evasive action!

175
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:31,125
What are you doing!
Are you trying to kill my men?

176
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,541
If they can't keep their asses
in the plane they'll have a hell

177
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,250
of a time on the
drop from thirteen.

178
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,166
That's a little
different ya know!

179
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,583
Listen kid. In order
to carry your crew

180
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,458
I got no weapons but
machine guns on this thing.

181
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,541
If I don't make a few bluffs
we're sittin' ducks up here.

182
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,666
They've always been
a gutless bunch of morons,

183
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,666
but they do have
some serious firepower.

184
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,541
Think you can outmaneuver them?

185
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,458
I got a feeling they're just
about to make their big move.

186
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,708
Hold on!

187
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,125
Damnit!

188
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:21,875
It would appear that we have

189
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,291
quite an experienced
pilot on our hands.

190
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,375
Our fighters will need
to be far more aggressive

191
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,708
if they're to take him down.

192
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,583
The Air Force
commander is livid.

193
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,000
Perhaps his missiles can

194
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,291
accomplish what
his airmen cannot.

195
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,291
No. That won't do.

196
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,750
A lovely red would
suit you much better.

197
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,000
A deep, sanguine crimson.

198
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:07,541
A little war, huh?
I smell more money.

199
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,916
Alright Medusa, looks like
you and I have another chance

200
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,583
to grab some rainy day cash.
I swear, did those idiots forget

201
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:17,708
that we sunk their battleship
the last go round? Oh well.

202
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,625
Oh crap!

203
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,041
Put a sock in it!

204
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,166
Those damn fools! Firing away
without a care in the world!

205
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,208
Hey! I got em!

206
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,583
What!

207
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,416
Alright!

208
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,416
You want war?

209
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,333
I'll give ya war!

210
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,625
What the hell was that?!

211
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,041
No! That's insane!

212
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,666
She's giving us quite
an entertaining show.

213
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,666
I now assume all duties
as commander in chief.

214
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,083
My first order is to

215
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,625
strip the Air Force commander
of his rank immediately.

216
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,791
Then arrest him for
endangering our citizens.

217
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:30,958
Yes, ma'am.

218
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,083
Soichiro, relay
this message for me.

219
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:38,041
"At this time Zeus will assume
control of all defense systems."

220
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,250
"Armed Forces Joint
Headquarters will reside

221
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,750
in a Special Executive Office

222
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,166
of the prime minister
until further notice."

223
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,958
Yes, of course.

224
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,041
Reon, kindly see
our visitors receive

225
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:52,541
the proper greeting they're
owed. Something very special.

226
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,125
Yes ma'am. I believe I have

227
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,791
just the thing in
mind for this occasion.

228
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:04,625
Ahhh! What a lively play
this is! Such sounds and colors!

229
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:08,250
Have you a decent bone
in your body? Hush your mouth.

230
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,750
Why, Miiko?

231
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,291
It is true tragedy.

232
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,375
Dying is not something
others do to entertain us.

233
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,041
What purpose then?

234
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,333
Before you now
is hope for survival.

235
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,583
Self-sacrifice for
the lives of others.

236
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,125
Self-sacrifice?

237
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,375
Indeed. It's what Sayoko and
I do for you, precious child.

238
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,708
Our needs are
secondary to yours.

239
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,666
Then our eyes are
witness to a joyous occasion!

240
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,958
Suppose you were to turn to me

241
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,250
and register naught
but empty space.

242
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,291
The warmth at
your back turn cold?

243
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:50,708
Miiko! Thou must not!
Without thy warmth!

244
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,500
We would surely wither away.

245
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,625
Please do not believe
for a moment that ours are

246
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,333
the only lives with
value in this world, dear.

247
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,208
Each one snuffed out
leaves another in darkness.

248
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,041
We pray thee.
Grant thy forgiveness.

249
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,375
Benight our naive words!

250
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:11,458
What the hell? What are
those? Friendlies?

251
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,208
Crete two's down!

252
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,541
There's no way in
hell you're gonna be able

253
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:39,958
to pull a cowboy
move like that!

254
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,458
There's no other way!

255
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,666
I never saw a machine
move like these things.

256
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,625
You're way outta your
league here, little girl!

257
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,666
No matter how tough
this gets I'll never give up

258
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,708
on the mission
I came here to do!

259
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,708
My people are counting on me,
and I won't let them down!

260
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,000
She's a stubborn
little firecracker.

261
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,625
I just hope you live
through this crazy stunt.

262
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:01,458
If I do, I'll live
without any regrets!

263
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,375
Then so be it. Your way, then.

264
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,500
Those Air Force slags may
have been gutless bastards,

265
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,250
but now we got an enemy
on our hands that doesn't

266
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,166
give a damn
about their own allies.

267
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,250
Thank you, sir. I have
all the faith in the world

268
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,250
you can pull us through, K.D.

269
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,416
It's Konoe.

270
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,541
Huh?

271
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,458
Konoe Daichi. That's my name.

272
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,250
Then I'm very pleased
to meet you Mr. Daichi.

273
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,916
You'd better believe
this is gonna cost you extra!

274
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,166
I'm trusting you
with our lives, Konoe.

275
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,041
I owe you one! Hurry up!

276
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,000
Uh. So now what?

277
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:04,250
You think we can
call our techie? Kuniko!

278
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,958
I've spent my whole life
running from little balls.

279
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,625
What are you talking about?

280
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,416
It appears the
artillery fire originated from

281
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,291
a location somewhere in the
Ota region. Near the Tama River.

282
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,333
Something is rotten here.

283
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,583
It's conjecture at this
point, but I believe there is

284
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,208
a connection to
the previous barrage

285
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,416
our forces
took from Ikebukuro.

286
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,916
Something is definitely rotten.

287
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,833
Seriously? You want
me to leave them out there?

288
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:45,958
She's not the type you need
to worry about. They'll be fine.

289
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,125
Must be nice to have faith
in your leaders like that.

290
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,416
Well, alright then! This is
about to get interesting!

291
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,666
Looks like we're in
good hands with ol' K.D.

292
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,500
Now let's do our part!

293
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:15,666
You know, I've always been
a sucker for those flyboys.

294
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:39,291
Is everybody out?
I've lost sight of our bogey!

295
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,750
No. That's impossible.

296
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,166
This will be our test mission.

297
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,625
These mimetic
drones haven't been

298
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,375
utilized in actual combat yet,

299
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,416
but I think we'll be pleasantly
surprised with the results.

300
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,083
Should prove
intriguing to say the least.

301
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,125
Deploy!

302
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,458
I'm last outta the can,

303
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,583
so you're clear to fall
back to a safer location!

304
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,208
Loud and clear!
Now get the hell out!

305
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,166
Damnit. My ass is grass.

306
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:18,750
Hey!

307
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,125
Over here!

308
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,625
You got it man!

309
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,250
President!

310
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,250
I won't let you
bastards kill my men!

311
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:53,125
She's a firecracker till
the end! Sayonara. And godspeed.

312
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:59,583
What's he doing! No.
Konoe, don't. Don't do it!

313
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,041
Konoe. No!

314
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,541
You may break our bodies...

315
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,916
But you'll never
break our spirits!

316
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,458
Oh crap!

317
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,833
I can't take my eyes
off you for a minute, can I?

318
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,833
Now why would you wanna do that?

319
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,333
Konoe!

320
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:06,666
What a relief.
Wait. What the--?

321
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,875
Wasn't there a huge hole
in that thing a second ago?

322
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,791
The city, rich in mystery,

323
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:48,208
a volley of faces
for those who dare look.

324
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:51,041
Separating truth from
fiction is no easy task.

325
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:55,125
But the core of Atlas, though
fantastic, is all too real.

326
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:58,000
Next time: "Transfigured City"
