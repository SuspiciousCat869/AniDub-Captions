1
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,958
Ready to commence operations.

2
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:43,291
Standing by at the northern
edge of the Kanto district.

3
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,541
Alright, then. Let's do
what has to be done.

4
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:14,500
So it begins. They're at
the northern edge of Kanto.

5
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,958
Operation Daedalus
Clean-Sweep is on.

6
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,166
Ground winds are
out of the southwest,

7
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,625
approximately ten
meters per second.

8
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,625
Evacuees from Old
Shibuya have been received.

9
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,833
The area is clear.

10
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,666
The ones coming in from Old
Meguro will be taken in shortly.

11
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,833
Fine.

12
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,125
The fuck'd you just say?!

13
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,583
Don't even start with me, dude.
You're the one pointin' fingers!

14
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,333
Oh yeah? Well then
stop stealin' my water!

15
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,333
Hey, hey, hey!
Knock it off, ladies!

16
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,625
Blankets for anyone
who needs one.

17
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,541
Just raise your hand
and I'll come to you.

18
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,083
I've got some good news.

19
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:11,375
There's food waiting for us
in the tent just in back of me.

20
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,125
Form a damn line! This
ain't a friggin' cattle call!

21
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,750
Try to stay calm.

22
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,000
Hey, man. Where
the hell's Furukawa?

23
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,291
We got a rice-cooker totally
on the blink back here.

24
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,791
You probably don't
wanna hear this,

25
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,166
but I haven't seen
him since we came in.

26
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,666
Toshima, huh? Let's see
where they've got you.

27
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,541
D-Block. Over that direction.

28
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,166
Just on the left.
You can't miss it.

29
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,291
'preciate it.

30
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,916
My, my... Thank you, hon.

31
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,333
Sure.

32
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,833
The next wave of
them are en route.

33
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,875
You should make
necessary preparations.

34
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:50,583
No disrespect, cutie, but
in case you haven't noticed,

35
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,875
we're at max-cap.

36
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,208
I'm sorry.

37
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,750
Just re-route them.

38
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:56,666
Rules are rules.

39
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,541
Ugh! Seriously?

40
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,125
Pretty boy. You ever
going to wrangle free

41
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:05,000
of momma's apron
strings? Rules are so passé.

42
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:08,583
They will arrive
presently. Thank you.

43
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:12,416
Hey! Don't-- Now what?

44
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:17,125
It's fine. Really. I'll go ask
our group if we can make room.

45
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,291
Uh. You sure, hon?

46
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,625
Oh, yeah. Kuniko's going
all out for these people.

47
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,541
So, I've gotta do my
best to try and keep up.

48
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,166
Attention! Looks like
we've got another group

49
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,333
of evacuees coming in.

50
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,458
Let's see if we can't
shift around a little.

51
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,625
There's not even
enough room for us!

52
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,291
The people over there too
good to give up their space?

53
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,333
Yeah, no kidding!

54
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:43,083
Look! It's not
perfect. But c'mon!

55
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:46,083
Please? Every
centimeter will help!

56
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,250
We're all in this together!

57
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,791
The little girl's
got some grapes.

58
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,041
Was that--?

59
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,083
They've started.

60
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:28,375
How they slip away.
The years, I mean.

61
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,541
My match with Ryoko was
the first such bout in ages.

62
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,750
She clean your clock?

63
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,750
Actually, the game
was my only victory.

64
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,625
A shame. I never
imagined she'd go

65
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,291
so far off the
rails with all of this.

66
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,875
She's a warning. An object
lesson in the dangers

67
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,583
of giving a marionette
too much slack.

68
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,625
Our comrade? Yes.

69
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,125
He's quite assuredly
on the premises.

70
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,791
Would you care to see him?

71
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,541
Just what are you up to?

72
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,541
Making it abundantly
clear that Atlas is

73
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,708
no longer your dream alone.

74
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:10,375
Perhaps, but neither
is it your playpen.

75
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:13,208
The Digmas.
This belongs to them.

76
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:17,375
Ah. We'll see
about that, won't we?

77
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:22,708
I suspect the bombing
is in full swing by now.

78
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,375
From this point forward,
Japan's carbon index

79
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:29,166
will increase exponentially.
Panic will wash over market

80
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,541
after market like a tidal wave.

81
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,791
Reducing to flotsam
on a rocky beach

82
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,791
the carbon-based
economy we worked

83
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,041
so passionately to realize.

84
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,000
The hell it will.
I do not accept that!

85
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,250
Not while the tower
is still upright.

86
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,958
"Hereupon, all the
powers of heaven

87
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,791
joined in a single voice."

88
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,458
"And two gods of the last
generation in whose ears

89
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:58,250
it rang were called
upon to form the land.

90
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:02,583
Thus did Izanagi-no-Mikoto
and Izanami-no-Mikoto

91
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,000
become purveyors
of the Earth."

92
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,750
"Granting them
a bejeweled spear,

93
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:10,583
this task the heavenly host
did charge them to perform."

94
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:13,125
"And so, the two gods
descended from the sky

95
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:16,416
to stand upon the bridge
'twixt heaven and earth,

96
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,166
and plunging the
spear into the sea

97
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,583
stirred the brine round
and round, till it churned

98
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:25,375
with unimaginable fury,
lapping at their heels."

99
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,833
"Withdrawing the spear,
drops of curdled brine fell

100
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:35,083
from its tip back into the sea.
Thus, Onogoro was born."

101
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,291
"Setting foot upon
the newly formed isle,

102
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,666
the heavenly pair did erect
a pillar to their achievement,

103
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,500
and soon after, a palace
eight fathoms high."

104
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,750
"Hereupon, Izanagi-no-Mikoto
spake to his betrothed.

105
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,500
'Together have we worked
this miracle,' said he,

106
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:56,708
'together let us circumvent
in a dance of fortunes this

107
00:08:56,791 --> 00:09:01,583
mighty pillar and meet, so to
be joined here as in the sky.'"

108
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,250
"But having done so,
and thereafter having joined

109
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:09,125
as conjugal halves,
the child Hiruko was born."

110
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,000
"Tis a leech," said they.

111
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:16,666
"Let us cast him aloft upon
the sea in a boat of reeds."

112
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:23,583
The capital! It is
engulfed in flames!

113
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,208
The seal will be
exposed to plain sight.

114
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,750
The seal will be vulnerable!

115
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,458
The infestation zone is

116
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,958
approximately
forty percent cleared.

117
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,875
What's on your mind?
I know you must have

118
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,291
a million thoughts
going on up there.

119
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,166
It's funny.

120
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,416
When we were little kids, they
always told us to stay away

121
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,250
from the forest. There was
supposed to be all kinds

122
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,666
of bad stuff in there
lying in ambush.

123
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,875
Make it out and heaven only knew
what'd you be infected with.

124
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,958
'course, out in the open,
our little houses were getting

125
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,166
barraged with hail stones
the size of grapefruits

126
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,041
every time you turned around.

127
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,500
If you got injured,
good luck finding a hospital.

128
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,666
Not a lot of doctors come from

129
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,166
little backwaters
short on schools.

130
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:16,541
Wasn't much of a life,
really. But... I'll miss it.

131
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,916
I mean, it might
have been hell...

132
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,750
But still, it's the
place where I grew up.

133
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,250
Blast! Heft it! On the double!

134
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,458
Aye!

135
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,375
Sounding off. One!

136
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:50,083
Two!

137
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,625
Kah-boom!

138
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,958
Salvaged loot?

139
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:53,833
Aye-aye!

140
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,041
Spark-a-ly!

141
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,375
Initiating
Fire-Earthquake-and-Artillery

142
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,291
Resistant Living Pod.

143
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:04,583
A.K.A.: Super Shelter X
Mark Two engaging immediately!

144
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,000
Ka-plink!

145
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,750
We gotta have our
priorities, right, fellas?

146
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,458
Shwashy-washy!

147
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,083
This battle will one day
be inducted into the annals

148
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:30,208
of history as the Big One. Pray
we live to see that day arrive.

149
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,750
What be this fearful noise?

150
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,083
I'm so scared!

151
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,916
Oh, mistress.

152
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,333
The crazy bitch
is bombing Tokyo.

153
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:49,875
Heh. Now, Ryoko.
You're that foolish?

154
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:53,875
Sayoko? Sayest thou
a war hath begun?

155
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,833
Worry not, milady.
It shall be ended soon.

156
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,500
But how will Miiko
fare in the interval?

157
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,708
Karin has assured me
that this edifice was built

158
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,625
to withstand disasters
the magnitude of

159
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,625
the Second Great
Kanto Earthquake.

160
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:10,333
So we should all be quite
safe as long as we remain here.

161
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:14,916
Forsooth. That said. What
task hath Karin so occupied?

162
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,208
We've not seen her
since early this morning.

163
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:22,083
I've no clue. She's barricaded
herself in her chambers.

164
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,791
Japan's carbon index
is already at 2.88.

165
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,583
And it's climbing
like a mountain goat.

166
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,208
"Carbonists everywhere
are running around

167
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,000
like they've got a
fire in their pants."

168
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,958
Japan was supposed
to be a sure bet.

169
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,208
They couldn't
have seen this coming.

170
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:42,625
"Smart move keeping the info
on the bombing to ourselves."

171
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,083
Oh, yeah. There's no
rush in the world like being

172
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,666
the only person in
the world making moolah!

173
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,250
Karin! Help me!

174
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,916
Water levels continue to rise.

175
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,833
Danger level:
seventy-five percent.

176
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,125
Immediate response required!

177
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,833
Hold your horses, okay?
Just trust me.

178
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,541
Any second now,
I'll let you run as wild

179
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,041
and free as your heart desires.

180
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,125
Infestation zone update:

181
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,708
approximately seventy
percent wiped out.

182
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,708
Index rising.

183
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,750
No signs of stopping.
Five point O-one.

184
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,625
Saudi Arabia.
Three point eighteen.

185
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:23,083
Indonesia.
Three point five-seven.

186
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,750
The United States.
Three point nine-one?

187
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,750
Every major market
is in turmoil because of

188
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:31,041
the panic Japan's
actions have set in motion.

189
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:34,500
Understood. I just heard
from a U.N. representative

190
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,083
that an anti-Medusa
resolution has carried.

191
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:40,375
Seems rather backward.
Given the markets.

192
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,125
The markets are
what's driving it.

193
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,166
They know what
they're doing, believe me.

194
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,500
If Medusa steps in to take
advantage of the panic,

195
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,208
a formal command
can now be issued for

196
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,750
the harboring nation
to attack Medusa's base.

197
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:54,250
If that nation doesn't comply,
their rights can be sidestepped.

198
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,333
Anyone with the
means can invade them.

199
00:13:56,416 --> 00:14:00,166
So, then, they're
expecting Medusa to strike.

200
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,291
That seems to be the case.

201
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,500
It's gonna be fine.

202
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,375
You and me will go look
for your mommy right now.

203
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,625
Tomoka!

204
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,208
Hey. You seen Momoko anywhere?

205
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,583
Uh-uh.

206
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,041
Man, I've been lookin'
every place I can think of,

207
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,333
but so far no luck.

208
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,666
Think she's okay?

209
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,958
There's somethin' else, too.

210
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,583
A corporation guy
says we gotta make

211
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,041
a formal list of
all the evacuees.

212
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:33,083
Yeah, like we have the time
to screw around with that!

213
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,208
Fine then. I guess
I'll go talk to him.

214
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,333
Just keep an eye
on this little girl, kay?

215
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,208
Uh. Sure.

216
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,125
Miss Kuniko.

217
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,458
Go on.

218
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,916
We're approaching
the designated coordinates.

219
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,625
ETA, eighty seconds.

220
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,291
Understood.

221
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,291
Hey. What are you doing?

222
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,541
Something I need to
do myself if I ever wanna

223
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,833
be at peace with all of this.

224
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,000
Duomo!

225
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:47,125
No tears now. Farewells
ought to be about gratitude.

226
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,583
Don't shrink. Don't cry.

227
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,125
Passing control
to your terminal.

228
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:57,208
The moment you see the target
change color, engage the switch.

229
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,625
Understood.

230
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,541
40 seconds.

231
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:49,291
10 seconds.
Nine. Eight. Seven. Six.

232
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:54,208
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

233
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,791
Engaging.

234
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,291
Impact confirmed.

235
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,333
Thank you.

236
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,000
What's wrong?

237
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,208
That sound.

238
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,541
Did you?

239
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,750
Yeah. I think.

240
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,166
D'ya hear that mother?

241
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,250
Oh good. I'm not going mad.

242
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,166
Something troubling you?

243
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,791
I can hear it.

244
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,041
Oh my god.

245
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,833
The clock tower.

246
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:46,791
In Duomo. The old bell.
I heard it ringing out the hour.

247
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,958
Listen, we're flying
at an altitude of

248
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,250
ten thousand feet up here.

249
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,708
You couldn't have.

250
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,916
No, I did.

251
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:18,416
Thank you. There'll never
be another place like you.

252
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:30,208
Infestation zone update.
The fires are spreading.

253
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:36,458
Operation complete.
All planes return to base.

254
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,625
I repeat:
All planes return to base.

255
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,916
Who knew the impudent
little wench had it in her?

256
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Perhaps indulging her
was worth my while after all.

257
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,583
As of now, the only
Daedalus plants remaining

258
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,916
are on Level Eight.

259
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,583
Where, for obvious reasons,

260
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:58,833
wholesale fire-bombing
isn't exactly a viable option.

261
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,291
So, what's to be done?

262
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,291
For that matter, what's to be
done about the carbon index?

263
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:09,333
Brace for impact, guys.
Twenty-five point four.

264
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,291
That's it.
Japan has just become

265
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,958
the poorest nation
in the entire world.

266
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:22,750
I did it! I'm set
for life! Oh man.

267
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:26,458
I may just be the wealthiest
person in existence right now.

268
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,375
"So we did good?" 

269
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:32,083
You bet we did. And believe it
or not I'm just getting started!

270
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,416
I'm not gonna rest till
every last cent is mine!

271
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,875
Water levels rising.
Water levels rising.

272
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:43,166
Danger level: Ninety-nine
percent. Emergency.

273
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,708
Immediate response required!

274
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:49,708
Take a pill, 'fraidy cat.
You've earned it, though.

275
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,125
Here's your life raft.
You're welcome.

276
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,791
Medusa?

277
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:03,416
Medusa?!
What's wrong with you?

278
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,958
From the bowels of
a city razed to embers,

279
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:51,083
a seal most
sacred shall emerge

280
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,833
to light the way
towards a new path.

281
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:57,541
Next time:
