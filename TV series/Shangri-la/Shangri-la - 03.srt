1
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,166
We have to act quickly.
Time is against us.

2
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:33,791
The child will be born soon.

3
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,833
Atlas must be
completed before then.

4
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,166
That dream bothering you again?

5
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,166
Kinda. It's just
weird I keep having it.

6
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,750
Been a while, too.

7
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:32,708
That voice I hear just creeps
me out. And it's all so random.

8
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,375
Probably just a
memory of something

9
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,541
you overheard in the womb.

10
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,375
Your birth mother lives
in Atlas, after all.

11
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:43,583
Yeah. Guess that could be why.

12
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,041
Did I just hear you say that?!
Grandma, what in the Hell?!

13
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,375
All done. Try not to slosh them.

14
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:50,916
'kay, not really pertinent!

15
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,083
You just dropped a bombshell
on me out of the blue!

16
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,500
I mean, I think you just did!

17
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:58,875
Calm down. All good things,
m'dear. Be patient.

18
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,333
Kuniko.

19
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,875
You coming with or aren't ya?

20
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,666
Everybody and
their dog's waiting.

21
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,208
Look, just give me
a second; I'm kinda--

22
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,291
See she doesn't drop these, eh?

23
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,583
Grandma!

24
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,416
Oh wow. It's so cool
of you to make noms.

25
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,541
Hey, we're not done!

26
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,041
Yeah. I'm sure it can wait.

27
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,416
Ugh! Well at least
let me get my shoes on!

28
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,291
Just go barefoot;
no one cares.

29
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:27,291
Okay, we gotta be quick.
You sure our intel's reliable?

30
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,750
Furukawa said as good as gold.

31
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,000
Get ready.

32
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,000
Right, let's do it!

33
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,583
Sir, yes sir!

34
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,583
All this fuss just for lil'
ol' me??!

35
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,791
And here. Also with
her compliments.

36
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,666
Oh, dear. Oh dear!

37
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,791
This is the last time I'll ever
eat Nagiko's pickled herring!

38
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,416
Come on. You're gonna
pickle your face

39
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,875
if you keep with
the waterworks, hon.

40
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,583
Miiko, love,
you are a catastrophe.

41
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,541
Now where on Earth is Momoko?

42
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,833
Now that you mention it,
I haven't seen her all day.

43
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,333
Tak is MIA, too. The Hell,
it's not like they can

44
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,583
put off saying
goodbye till it's convenient.

45
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,500
It's fine.

46
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,750
Huh?

47
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,250
Well, can you blame them
for not wanting to watch

48
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:25,625
a grown woman cry her eyes out?
Besides, I'm an absconder!

49
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,416
Come on.
Don't talk like that.

50
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,833
Everybody's thrilled for you.

51
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,583
S'yeah they are! I mean,
look at where you get to live!

52
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,375
So. You gonna become
a model citizen or what?

53
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,500
Uh. Well, not exactly.

54
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,708
I'm going on a
food binge first thing.

55
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:42,083
Some fatty Mediterranean.
Then French, then Italian.

56
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,541
Why am I not surprised?

57
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,458
Ah, but wait! Once my lil'
reward bender is wrapped up,

58
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,125
I'm reviving Tropical Fish!

59
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,625
That sounds familiar.

60
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,958
Is that the drag club
you and Momoko used to run?

61
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,041
Drag club?! Uh, please.

62
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:57,958
We put on the finest burlesque
revue Roppongi had ever seen!

63
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,541
Full to bursting every
night, if you can imagine.

64
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,333
Ah, and the two
of us back then!

65
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:06,000
The hottest ticket
in town, bar none!

66
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,375
You watch!

67
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,333
I'll sashay through those
gates and take Atlas by storm!

68
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:11,416
Just don't
think you're going

69
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,708
to skimp me on
the profits, Mama Rose.

70
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,291
Yes, I'm late,
but I look fabulous.

71
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,916
Sweet Ellie May!
You held on to our sign.

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,208
You bet your ass. I break
hearts, my dear, not promises.

73
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,875
God. How many
years has it been?

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,666
Our sacred pact.

75
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,750
See girls. We swore we'd
make it to Atlas one day,

76
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,333
and reopen the club.

77
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,416
Wait, you're not
actually giving me that?!

78
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,875
But I-I can't do it alone!

79
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,583
Sure you can.

80
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:06,333
I swear, you
hear me? I promise you.

81
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:10,166
Oh. Yes.
Tropical Fish will live!

82
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,458
Well, I guess this is it.

83
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,625
We'll miss you.

84
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,833
Do give us a shout
once you're settled in.

85
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,166
Done.

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,750
Oh, my. Farewell,
treasured comrades!

87
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,500
I'll think of you every day!

88
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,541
Bye-bye, Miiko!

89
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,833
Takehiko. You son of a bitch.

90
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,416
That jerk!

91
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,333
"Let not the hours pass but that
our thoughts align and our--"

92
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,125
Ta-Takehiko!

93
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,833
Kick some ass!

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,916
Yes. I-I'll do
my absolute best!

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,458
And you'd better believe
there'll be a VIP booth

96
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:53,208
with your name on it
when Tropical Fish reopens!

97
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,375
Ha! I knew you were a softie!

98
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,541
Enough screwin' around!
We're headin' back!

99
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,875
Man in need, right here!

100
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,291
If you have any
bread or flour...

101
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,000
One at a time, folks!
Keep it neat or you get diddly.

102
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,458
Show of hands who
wants Atlas baked ham!

103
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,125
Here you go. Heads up!

104
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,458
Easy now! Damn it, be civil!

105
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,041
Wow, they're goin nuts.

106
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,416
Stop! As far
as we're concerned,

107
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,083
Metal Age can take its
ill-gotten goods elsewhere!

108
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,583
What the Hell, man?!

109
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,166
Knock off the act! You guys
are bad news for all of us!

110
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,041
You brought down
the army on our homes!

111
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,291
I don't have a roof
anymore thanks to you jerks!

112
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,083
Hey, if the slags are trigger
happy, it's not our fault, dude!

113
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,250
That attack was
completely unprovoked!

114
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,541
Ya steal from the government,

115
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,541
ya expect 'em to bring
you a bouquet of roses?!

116
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,250
You're all a bunch of thieves!

117
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,375
Yeah? Who do you think
brings us medical supplies

118
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,583
when we need 'em, asshole?

119
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,083
You want a piece of me?

120
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,458
For your information, some
of us actually work for Atlas

121
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,583
and get paid a damn
good wage for the trouble!

122
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,708
That's all well and good
if you're able to work!

123
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,583
What do you expect
the elderly to do?

124
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,833
We're supposed to be
helpin' each other out!

125
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,041
What do you think
Metal Age is all about?!

126
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,750
Great, and when we
accept their help,

127
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,458
the whole damn town gets
branded as a terrorist front!

128
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,000
No kidding!

129
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,666
What good will it be if we all
get denied access to Atlas?

130
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,708
Hey, I know her.

131
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,458
Tragic. Poor woman
just hasn't been the same

132
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,875
since she lost her
newborn child last year.

133
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,166
Really.

134
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,375
Little thing wasn't
really even all that sick.

135
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,708
But our hospitals have bupkis
in the way of medical supplies.

136
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,833
I say Metal Age needs to
clear the Hell out of Duomo!

137
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,208
Can it, everybody!

138
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,208
Honey, don't. Easy.

139
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,916
Listen to yourselves!

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,666
Ha! Little Miss "Heir
Apparent" gonna weigh in now?

141
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,666
By all means, princess, tell us
what you know about the issue.

142
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,791
Seriously? After all I've done.

143
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,416
We got a hail storm!

144
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,833
Everyone get inside!

145
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:45,708
Load 'er up!

146
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,291
All of you back in your homes!

147
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,125
Right! Get us out of here!

148
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:10,583
What good'll it be if we all
get denied access to Atlas?

149
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,291
Bye-bye, Kuni!

150
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,375
See ya!

151
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,000
Just hurry up and get
home 'fore you catch a cold.

152
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,750
I saved something for ya!

153
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,750
Thanks.

154
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,916
Your wife actually managed
to scare up some ham today.

155
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,166
Did she now?
Clever little minx.

156
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,333
Well, the Metal Age
boys helped a bit.

157
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,166
My hats off to 'em.

158
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,833
Oh sweetie, I know it hurts.

159
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,875
Just hang in there
for mommy, okay?

160
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,791
Little thing wasn't
even really all that sick.

161
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,708
I'd forgotten
what it was like here.

162
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,000
The entire time I was in Juvie,

163
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,208
I had a roof over my head

164
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,333
that didn't whiz
on you when it rained.

165
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,500
The plumbing was functional
and the infirmary good.

166
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,041
Three hot squares
a day, everyday--

167
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,416
'course they were awful.

168
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,250
Ugh! I can't get
my head around it!

169
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,000
Miiko's been gaga
about Atlas since forever,

170
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,958
and Takehiko's convinced
it's a Den of Liars.

171
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,833
Ah, well.

172
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,166
Tell me the truth, Momoko,

173
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,000
ya think we'd all
be happier living there,

174
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,583
or is it just
smoke and mirrors?

175
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,208
I don't know.

176
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:57,708
Is happiness a chocolate
bar whenever you want one?

177
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,666
Not when they go straight
to your thighs, dear.

178
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,708
Not bad.

179
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,708
Know what?

180
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,375
You gotta taste
life for yourself.

181
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,375
Till I get into Atlas
and have a look around,

182
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,625
I'm never gonna know

183
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,708
whether it's something
I'd choose for myself.

184
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,375
You are piece of work, m'love.

185
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,291
As willful now as
the day they made you.

186
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:33,375
That's it. I need
to see it for myself.

187
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,916
Infinite wealth
is such a burden.

188
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,458
A girl could spend half a life
deciding what to spend it on.

189
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:53,375
Help me. Help me. Help me.
Help me. Help me. Help me.

190
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,916
Fantastic.
Why did I program you

191
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,458
to be such a
whiny little nuisance?

192
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:58,791
Thanks for the heads-up.

193
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,000
I thought we were gonna wait

194
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,958
and screw with
the Saudi index later!

195
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,500
After we got around to nailing
Russia's balls to the wall.

196
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,875
That's fifty million euros

197
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,958
you just cost the
rest of us, cheater!

198
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:11,291
What?! I did absolutely
nothing of the sort!

199
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,708
What in the--?!

200
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,666
Master Hiruko appears
to have sensed it as well.

201
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,625
So then, that means...

202
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,833
That the amulets
did in fact resonate, yes.

203
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,625
Did he give any indication
of what it might portend?

204
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:34,250
Not yet. Nor has our incessant
"star gazing" yielded anything.

205
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,041
Of course not. Though,
you did encounter the Sun

206
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,708
in the outlying marshes,
did you not? Imaki?

207
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,333
Huh? I didn't
collide with her myself.

208
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,750
But the young lieutenant
involved has made a full report.

209
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,708
Quite so. I read
his report myself.

210
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,291
Ah.

211
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,625
Brooding over Shion again?

212
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,625
Forgive my making
light of your troubles

213
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,000
but that faraway look,

214
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,250
it's rather an obvious tell

215
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:03,166
that your mind
lies somewhere else.

216
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,666
Now that look, I like.

217
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,458
One fake ID, made to order.

218
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,958
Rockin'. How'd you
manage to get a hold of this?

219
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,083
The old boys in
Akihabra owed us a favor.

220
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,166
It may not be real, but it's
as close as you damn well get.

221
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,500
Those pervs
make my flesh crawl.

222
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,083
Are you sure
we can trust them?

223
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,333
Well, seein' as they're the only
outfit that can turn these out,

224
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,458
I'd say we don't
have much of a choice.

225
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,166
Why do they make
your "flesh crawl?"

226
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,166
Oh, sweets.
Just count your lucky stars

227
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,083
you don't have to meet them.

228
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,625
Leave me in the dark.

229
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:39,500
Uh-uh. Not till you both agree
to have me along as backup.

230
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,375
I know it's
not a Metal Age gig,

231
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,125
but say no and
you can get your own.

232
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,833
Oh yay.

233
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,791
Guess we're stuck with him.

234
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,500
Huh. To think
I'd live to see the day

235
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,583
when Kuniko would
itch to infiltrate Atlas.

236
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,083
Like they say,

237
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,708
"Till you've seen it yourself,
what do you really know?"

238
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,666
So, looks like we're
taking the scenic route, huh?

239
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,750
Don't be a backseat driver.

240
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,291
You have got to be kidding me-- 

241
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,375
Hey! Keep it down!

242
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,458
Well that was pleasant.

243
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,166
Damn it, quit screwin' around!

244
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,958
This government has blindsided
its citizens time and again,

245
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,750
mollifying them
with empty promises

246
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,416
Are those Metal Age people?

247
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,833
Yeah. They're the Nerima branch.

248
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,833
Oh dear.
I hope Miiko is alright.

249
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,666
Thirty-two-A,
forty-seven nine one two.

250
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,250
The name is Miiko.
I'd like a

251
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,458
Roppongi-style apartment,
if you have any to spare.

252
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,875
Nothing fancy, just
somewhere I can keep a cat.

253
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,875
I have you as Tetsuo Kumagai.

254
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,958
If that's correct, proceed left
to Level Eleven. Thank you.

255
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,458
Wait, I'm sorry, what?

256
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,750
I think there's been a mistake.

257
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,541
I need to enquire about
a proprietor's license.

258
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,750
Next in line please.

259
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:36,916
Move!

260
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,625
No, wait! I don't
think you understand--

261
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,750
Welcome to the Moon Palace.

262
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,375
Now, if you'll
kindly step forward

263
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,125
and check your belongings with
the attendants you see here.

264
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,583
That done, please form a
single-file line in front of me.

265
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,458
Hello there, girls.
How we doin'?

266
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,916
Now, I have some really
special stuff in here,

267
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,875
so I'd appreciate
you being extra careful.

268
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,500
Oh. That doesn't
look very, uh--

269
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,041
What are you doing?!

270
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,083
Oh my god!

271
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,541
Outta my way!

272
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,583
Nobody's gonna
make a liar outta me!!!

273
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,583
That all you got?!

274
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,875
The final candidate, milady.

275
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:14,875
Wh-Where am I?

276
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,833
The Hell are you?!

277
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:22,875
Bring forth that we may drink,
'tis time for our medicine.

278
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,041
Make haste!

279
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,875
I-- Uh, okay?

280
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,000
This here, you mean?

281
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,666
I can't believe we're
actually doing this.

282
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,500
I'll bet the men
here are top drawer.

283
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,166
Cool your jets, queenie.

284
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,958
Okay. Moment of
truth here, baby.

285
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,416
Oh no!

286
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,250
Hey! What the hell
you trying to pull?!

287
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:17,041
Um. I. Uh.

288
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:17,958
Oh crap.

289
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,166
Kuniko! Just run!

290
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,041
Damn it!

291
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,333
Hold it right--

292
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,208
Come on! Move!

293
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,791
So much for favors!

294
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,125
Anyone else feel like
a quick round of roulette?

295
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,625
You're kiddin' me!
Their response time.

296
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,041
This way! Hurry!

297
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,791
Slow down!
I don't like fast men!

298
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,083
Hey! Caboose here!

299
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,541
Intruders?

300
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,250
Spare me your excuses.

301
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,041
Construction continues,
regardless.

302
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,250
Shoot them.

303
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,375
Of course it's protocol!

304
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:57,291
Precisely. Clear away
the debris and get on with it.

305
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,833
Oh Hell. Don't shut
it down on us.

306
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,541
We're stuck in here with
a tranny for cryin' out loud.

307
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,791
Smooth move.
Take pot shots at the gal

308
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,250
who's an inch from your face.

309
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,083
Oh it's fine, hon.
Just his way of flirting.

310
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:22,250
Ugh. Let's take this ladder
here, just follow my lead.

311
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,666
So we're dancing now?

312
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,458
Men.

313
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,000
Lay off it!

314
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,583
Atta girl.

315
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,583
Run for it!

316
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,625
Oh crap.

317
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:46,958
Hurry up!

318
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,333
Wait!

319
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,416
Is that Duomo?

320
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,708
Wow. It's so... So tiny.

321
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,500
What's wrong with you?!

322
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,666
Get it in gear!

323
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,000
Come on!

324
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,500
You're gonna get us
all killed! Snap out of it!

325
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,000
Guys, did you see that?

326
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,541
All those buildings,
were houses, weren't they?

327
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,000
And there were
roads going everywhere.

328
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,666
I don't understand.
That place is gigantic!

329
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,125
It just doesn't make sense!

330
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,708
Kuniko.

331
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,208
I'm outta ammo. So we prolly got
about another minute to live.

332
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,625
Don't give up! There's
some way outta this hellhole!

333
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,125
Look there!

334
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,041
You're insane!

335
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,708
And now we
have an earthquake?!

336
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,500
It's Atlas's
Mechanical Resonance!

337
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,750
I'm so terribly sorry, madam!

338
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,833
We have to move faster.

339
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:22,916
Move it or lose it!

340
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,625
I'm not a goddamn acrobat!

341
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,833
Wait, hold on. What in
the hell are they planning

342
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,750
to do with all
that space down there?

343
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,625
Oh for the love of Ella--
We can find out later!

344
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,958
Hold on tight!

345
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:41,083
Crap! Geronimo!

346
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,541
Grab on to the other end. I
need you to be a counterweight!

347
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,291
Yeah, I figured! Stop yelling!

348
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,458
Oh god!

349
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,208
It's the only way to fly!

350
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,583
You don't have nestle so close.

351
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,166
No one's touchin' you
on purpose, believe me!

352
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,458
It's huge. You saw it!
We could all live here!

353
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:07,250
There's room! Why don't
they let us all be citizens?!

354
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:10,625
I don't understand! Why?

355
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:46,375
Hey, Momo! Check out
this cool stuff!

356
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,166
Whoa, is that a
vacuum tube?! That's crazy!

357
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,666
It's like a fossilized miracle

358
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,500
from the dawn of
the information age!

359
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,000
How awesome is that?!

360
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:57,125
Next time: "Uber-Akihabara"
