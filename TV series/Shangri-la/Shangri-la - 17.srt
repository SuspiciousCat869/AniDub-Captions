1
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,791
A whole forest overrun with
this stuff is not gonna be good.

2
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:25,375
Our future's basically
forfeit unle--

3
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:30,333
Your future's basically
forfeit either way.

4
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,875
What're you doing?

5
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,166
Talk to me--

6
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,458
Shut up!

7
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,458
It's not like I
got a fuckin' choice!

8
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,333
Don't do this.
There's always a choice.

9
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,791
Yeah, sure.
This from someone who

10
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,375
doesn't even know
who the hell she is.

11
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:42,000
Explain it to me then.
Why do you have to do it?

12
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,666
Since when is my friend a thug?

13
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't have a choice
because you're a Triple A.

14
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,250
Fantastic. The stupid
little meatspace manqué

15
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,000
has an Atlas Ranking
that puts everyone else

16
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,041
on the hierarchy to shame.

17
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,541
"Imagine dredging up that
kinda intel from Zeus's core?

18
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:05,958
I mean, what are the chances?"

19
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,625
"Can all three of them
really be Triple A's?"

20
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,750
Yep. 'course, all the
other rankings Atlas doles out

21
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,666
are pretty much
meaningless anyway.

22
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,666
Just something to offset
how hopeless their lot is.

23
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,125
Good ol' opiate for the masses.

24
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,708
"The brass must
think we're idiots."

25
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:27,333
The only people the corporation
cares about are these three.

26
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,500
Anything happens to
them and it's goodnight.

27
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,041
The whole ball o' wax is done.

28
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,791
I believed in it.
The Atlas con.

29
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,791
I thought we
really had a future.

30
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:45,291
Even if its bedrock had
to be a mountain of corpses.

31
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,458
What do you mean?!

32
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,291
I'm talkin' about
human sacrifices, girl!

33
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:53,000
It was the only way to offset
the mechanical resonance!

34
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,458
The only way to keep
the damn thing standing up.

35
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,833
Do you hear yourself?

36
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,833
I didn't know
the whole story then.

37
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,583
They were kids!

38
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,083
So many, if you
laid 'em end to end

39
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,375
they'd wrap around
the goddamn Earth!

40
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,875
Kids like my little sister.

41
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:25,166
If I'd a known back
then what I know now...

42
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,083
But hindsight is twenty twenty.

43
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:31,625
It has to stop.
And this is the only way.

44
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,708
If you believed
in Atlas so much,

45
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:37,083
what were you doing slumming
in Duomo in the first place?

46
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,875
I was assigned to
you as a bodyguard...

47
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,541
by the Corporation.

48
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:48,875
You were special. The only
Triple A I'd ever heard of.

49
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,208
Do it, then. Pull the trigger.

50
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,875
End my life!

51
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,333
Freeze!

52
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:43,750
Tell me. What's so
special about a Triple A?

53
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,875
They're the inheritors.

54
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,708
The inheritors of what?

55
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,541
That.

56
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,416
But hey... You ain't
got to share it with me.

57
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,708
Any more than Duomo, right?
Guys like me don't have a home.

58
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,916
Damn you! Don't talk
like that to me!

59
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,083
You belong in Duomo.
You always have.

60
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,166
Takehiko!

61
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,625
No!

62
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:34,208
Madam, Hiruko's
absence is troubling.

63
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,375
Are we certain that
inaction is the best path?

64
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,208
Inundated with matters
so grave, I mean.

65
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,083
Construction has
been stalled yet further,

66
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,125
who knows for how long.

67
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,333
On account of
Metal Age's assault.

68
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,333
The daedalus encroachment
hinders repair efforts--

69
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:52,041
All things flow
along their gradient.

70
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:56,833
Setbacks of this kind are mere
corollaries of transformation.

71
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,666
We have left the path
laid down by others.

72
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,416
From here on we follow
our own lights, yes?

73
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:31,833
That was messed up. How long
had he been with you guys?

74
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,916
The Hell was he talking about?

75
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,125
What reason would Atlas
have for sacrificing children?

76
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,750
I've, uh never heard that one.

77
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:40,958
But if there's any truth to it--

78
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,458
He was a grunt
for the corporation

79
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,875
this whole time
and we never knew.

80
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,541
I never even
knew he had a sister.

81
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,625
Please, convince me he was
out of his mind or something.

82
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,166
'cause if there's
truth to any of it,

83
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,333
I don't know what to believe!

84
00:07:56,583 --> 00:08:01,000
Sorry. I'm no expert on belief.

85
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,541
Thank you for saving my life.

86
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:10,416
You're a true soldier.
But, why are you here?

87
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,541
Because. I quit.

88
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,958
It's true. I guess
you could say me

89
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,583
and the "slags"
have parted company.

90
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,083
So, what're you
hoping to find out here?

91
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,583
I don't know.

92
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,333
Home is where you
hang your hat, I guess.

93
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
"Yeah, it's gonna be
pretty hard to get used to."

94
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:44,291
I suppose. Kinda weird to think
of an entire city as your house.

95
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:48,416
"But hey, you can't deny
this was a smart purchase."

96
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,416
Yep and all under my name.
If I'm gonna own it,

97
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,041
I'm gonna own it outright
from sidewalk to skyline.

98
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,291
"And we brought

99
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,958
all the syndicate
biggies under one banner."

100
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,416
"Neo Guild" does
have a nice ring to it.

101
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,541
"Music to our ears!" 

102
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,250
We sure do lead
a charmed life, huh?

103
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,791
Now we can get
back to earning again.

104
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,958
Madam President,
we're on the line with

105
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,208
someone claiming
to be a Mikuni rep.

106
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,875
She's really angling
to be put through.

107
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,666
"As in the Mikuni?" 

108
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:24,375
See that? A charmed life indeed.

109
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,791
Why does your leader
not yet deign to show?

110
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,916
Lady Mikuni's presence
is not to be shirked!

111
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,208
Gah. Calm down already.

112
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,625
Ta da.

113
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:48,083
You're president of
the Akihabara Neo Guild?

114
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,333
Yup.

115
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,208
And you're in sunglasses.

116
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,625
Hey, little thing called style.

117
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,958
Art thou that
shall be our sentinel?

118
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,791
Jackpot!

119
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,250
You certainly do penetrate
to the heart of things.

120
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,625
Allow me to bid you welcome
to the city of Akihabara.

121
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,250
My name is
Karin Ishida, my lady.

122
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,166
Thus, we are
delivered. So...

123
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,125
This township is known
as Akihabara, thou say'st?

124
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:21,000
We find it fierce
narrow and o'erstuffed.

125
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,125
Watch it, princess.

126
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:26,000
That's my home you're
talkin' smack about.

127
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,458
Karin. We must
impose upon thee

128
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,791
for immediate
medical assistance.

129
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,416
Miiko!

130
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,916
I hope these arrangements are
suitable for you, Lady Mikuni.

131
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,916
What's his trauma?
Surely they don't think just

132
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,916
dipping the kid in
water's gonna do anything?

133
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:05,875
The sickness is becalmed.

134
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,000
Indeed.

135
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,750
'kay. Eating my words now.

136
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:13,333
Miiko. We shall visit soon.

137
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,291
The barrier ought
to be erected forthwith

138
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,500
to avoid unnecessary
casualties.

139
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,125
Casualties? Wait, what?

140
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,875
Hey! Hold on!

141
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,166
What have I gotten into?

142
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,500
Charmed life. Just
remember, charmed life.

143
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,458
We shall subsist on
a mere fifty assistants.

144
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,833
And sixteen styles of

145
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,083
twelve-layer
kimonos shall suffice.

146
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,291
Hath we accord. Karin?

147
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:55,500
Yes, my lady.
We aim to please.

148
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,708
The Hell does she get off?!

149
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,625
Like I'm not already
hemorrhaging cash like

150
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,791
a hedge fund setting
her up in those digs!

151
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,708
Well, just you wait, you
little royal pain in the ass.

152
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,708
I'll have my ear to the ground
when you're named Atlas' heir.

153
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:11,291
Oh, and the favors I'm gonna
call in when that day comes!

154
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,791
Mark my words, Princess.

155
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,916
He was something else,
I'll tell you that.

156
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,208
Who'd have thought he
could've kept something

157
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,250
so big under wraps?

158
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,250
It just goes to
show you, I guess.

159
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,958
Folks aren't
often what they seem.

160
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,375
It's weird.
He told me something...

161
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:46,708
Something about me inheriting
Atlas, whatever that means.

162
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,708
Think he was just babbling?

163
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:52,458
I dunno. Anybody show
up to hand you the deed?

164
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,458
Your guess is just
as good as mine, hon.

165
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,666
President!

166
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,083
What is it?

167
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,166
Monitors say we've lost
contact with the Nerima Branch.

168
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,000
As requested. I trust
your Highness will

169
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,583
find them more than adequate.

170
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,416
Thou say'st these
are palace attendants?

171
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,291
Oh, yes. They're known
as "maids" in the vernacular.

172
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,500
But their work experience here

173
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,416
in Akihabara
uniquely qualifies them

174
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,625
to serve any and all of your
royal needs, rest assured.

175
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,833
Show her what ya got, ladies.

176
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,291
My mistress. Welcome home.

177
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,750
But we have not
left since your coming.

178
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:54,125
Oh, aren't you cute!

179
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,291
Speak truthfully.
Dost thou consider our person

180
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,000
as the star 'round
which thou orbit?

181
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,250
You betcha!

182
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,083
Idiot.

183
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,958
Oh crap! Oh crap!
Oh crap! Oh crap!

184
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:13,291
Oh, yes. This is price one
pays for untruthfulness here.

185
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,250
I recommend honesty.

186
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,500
Might have to rethink
the whole charmed life thing.

187
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:30,458
So now a lie equals
death by pretzeling.

188
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,208
Karin.

189
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,583
Uh, here!

190
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,041
We find thy efforts to
accommodate extraordinary.

191
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,708
You have our thanks.
Excellent work.

192
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,375
Uh. You're gracious
to say so, my lady.

193
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,000
And yet. We puzzle
wherefore a doyen of

194
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,916
high fashion such as thou so
zealously consents to serve us.

195
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,666
I'm as good as dead!
What am I supposed to say,

196
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,750
"'cause I intend to take
you for all you're worth"?

197
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,791
Yeah, bull's-eye politicking
that'd be. Think, think, think!

198
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,708
Tell you her you're a big fan,
which doesn't make sense

199
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,000
because you didn't know
her from Adam a few days ago.

200
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,333
Oh man, I either come out of

201
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,916
this looking like a
schmuck or a sailor's knot!

202
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,791
May it please you.

203
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,791
Her yen to serve and her
happiness are intertwined.

204
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,708
Or so I judge
from her enthusiasm.

205
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:17,041
Thou say'st well.
Quite pleased we are indeed.

206
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,625
Thank you for that.

207
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,875
But of course. It behooves
my purposes nothing

208
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,958
for you to die prematurely.

209
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,625
Just so we're clear,
our mission is

210
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,208
to locate the
Nerima Branch, and if

211
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:32,625
the situation calls for it,
rescue any survivors.

212
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,541
Keep in mind,
conditions here may be worse

213
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,333
than in Ikebukuro.
So Stay vigilant.

214
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,416
Roger.

215
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,291
Hey, hon. Should your
back be in need of gettin',

216
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,958
don't hesitate to
call your gal, Friday.

217
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,166
He may have
been a son-of-a-bitch,

218
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,166
but not having
Takehiko in your corner

219
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,458
is a sad state of affairs.

220
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,041
You got that right.

221
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:07,541
Holy... I'd say this is
officially getting out of hand.

222
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,500
Yeah. That strikes
me as a fair assessment.

223
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:16,750
Photochemical oxidant
concentrations are way up.

224
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,291
Maybe this'll help.

225
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,583
Oh, crap.

226
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:57,208
The beguiling aroma
of bergamot, ma'am.

227
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,500
Ideal for augmenting
your ladyship's mood--

228
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,958
You think any
part of me augmentable

229
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,000
by the mere
influence of scent?

230
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,583
I--I do not.

231
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,625
Madam Ryoko. Regarding
the daedalus spread...

232
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,291
Photochemical oxidant
dispersal is playing havoc

233
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:25,208
with the eco system. Surface
effects are already visible.

234
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,750
Reports of asphyxiation
and madness are flooding in

235
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:31,916
from the outlying areas.
How shall we proceed?

236
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,458
Well, historically
the lower classes

237
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,708
never seem to get a break,

238
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,916
why should now be
any different for them?

239
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,791
Hey! Anyone in there?!

240
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,250
Oh my dear god.

241
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:59,041
They didn't even have enough
time to get their masks on.

242
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,541
President?

243
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,458
Okay, listen up.
The Nerima branch has cashed in.

244
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:10,041
This base is hereby
abandoned. Pull back, now.

245
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:15,416
Go. It makes no sense to
have people stationed here now.

246
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,666
I'm a fool. Thank you.

247
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,500
How many does this make?

248
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,833
I don't keep count.
I'll be fine, though.

249
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,083
If you're at the breaking point,
we can always pull out of here.

250
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,500
No. I'm alright.

251
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,625
I know it sounds scary,
but I could manage

252
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:36,208
if it was just you to take care
of. I'm just worried that you--

253
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,791
Don't presume to
know what's good for me.

254
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,166
Shion, I--

255
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,375
The forest is
already too far gone.

256
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,708
The Daeldalus are spreading

257
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,750
so fast there's gonna be
nothing else growing there

258
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:07,958
before we know it.

259
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,208
Ahh, what I wouldn't
give for that virility.

260
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,291
Breeding like rabbits.

261
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,625
Cut it out, Mo.

262
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,208
This is serious. If we don't
find a way to stop those things,

263
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:19,125
even Atlas won't be
able to stand up to 'em.

264
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,166
We'll all be
driven to extinction.

265
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,000
I know. The Question is,
how do we stop them?

266
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,833
We use the one thing that works.

267
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:35,125
Dwomp. Dwomp. Dwomp.

268
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,708
Gentlemen. We have here
the crème d' la crème.

269
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,041
Flashy-flash! Taleen!

270
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,625
Enough with the figurine!

271
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,458
Being able to see
our lovely Karin's eyes

272
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,541
makes this photo far superior!

273
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,541
Ha! You think a
paltry pic trounces

274
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,833
a militant belle
emerging from a tank?!

275
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,583
Ugh! Spare me your junk pile!

276
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,333
This here is precious.
Rare enough--

277
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:58,250
Hey. Mind if we come in?

278
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,458
Bwaaap! Bwaap!
Bwaap. Bwaap!

279
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,375
Kuniko has
entered the building!

280
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,500
Momoko alert!
Repeat: Momoko alert!

281
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,458
Man your battle
stations, no pun intended.

282
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,416
Prepare to be
made love to, camera!

283
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,750
Just look at 'em.
May they never know adulthood.

284
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,333
So. You're here, too?

285
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,916
Well, it doesn't really matter.
Happy to see your face.

286
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,166
Ready for it?

287
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,750
I came here to get my
hands on another bomber.

288
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,625
Ba-ba-bum. Despair.

289
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,208
Not sure what's to despair.
I'm gonna need you guys

290
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,458
to make it a rush
order again, though.

291
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,125
But don't worry. Whatever
the cost, I'm good for it.

292
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,541
Think of Duomo
as your piggy bank.

293
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,333
The thing is,
the tactical difficulties of

294
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,083
acquisition have changed.

295
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,416
Whaddayamean?

296
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,125
You see, Akihabara's been
more or less taken over

297
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:52,666
by brand new high-roller. The
syndicates we usually go through

298
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,416
are under new management.

299
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,375
Course, she's
cute as a button,

300
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,083
so you won't hear
any complaints from us.

301
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,791
Ding ding ding ding!

302
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,458
I'm sure you pervs
put up quite a fight.

303
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,708
Hey, don't judge us!
We're not made of stone.

304
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,833
We may not possess
the purchasing clout to help,

305
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:12,000
but we could arrange a meeting
with the overlord in question.

306
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,916
If that's amenable.

307
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,166
Guess it'll have to be.

308
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:30,708
What are the chances?

309
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,500
Whoa, it's you.

310
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,083
The bear!

311
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,041
You okay?

312
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,208
Excuse me.

313
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,291
Another Triple A
at my doorstep.

314
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,416
Maybe lady luck
hasn't dissed me after all.

315
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,541
So. Supposing you
get this bomber you're on

316
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,125
the hunt for,
what'll you do with it?

317
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:07,500
Bomb Tokyo. We have to.

318
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,541
Calm yourself, dear.

319
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,625
Why must doing what
needs to be done trouble you?

320
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,875
If it's a matter of trust,
don't feel it's necessary.

321
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:55,125
One can use without it.

322
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:57,708
