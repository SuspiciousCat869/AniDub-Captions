Huh? What's that song about?

2
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,541
I'm drawing a
total blank on the words.

the day and the night...

Lieutenant! Lieutenant!

00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:40,125
C'mon, man say something!

10
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,916
We thought we'd lost you!

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,958
Where am I?

12
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:53,250
Oh God! Where're the rest?!

13
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,625
Well, looks like
it's back to normal.

14
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,166
Yeah, the market's
calmed down for now.

15
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,583
Hopefully that
means I get a vacation

16
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,541
from Klaris freaking out.

17
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:43,750
Hey, uh, Karin, you mind
if I ask you something?

18
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,500
I was kinda wondering
what your reason was

19
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,250
for doing this kind of work.

20
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,291
I dunno.

21
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,875
C'mon, Karin. Spill it.

22
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,291
It's nothing I feel
like talking about, okay?

23
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,458
It's cool. No big deal.

24
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,791
I mean I guess, it's so
my mom and dad will be--

25
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:01,625
Oh, crap!

26
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,375
Huh?! Why are you shouting?!

27
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,333
Sorry 'bout that!
I forgot that I'm supposed to

28
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,791
meet up with my folks
for dinner! I gotta run!

29
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,000
See ya later, Karin. Zai jian!

30
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,708
Don't be so nosy, Zhang.

31
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,833
Elevator Two is in use.

32
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,291
Huh?!

33
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,875
It's a cat.

34
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,083
"Enthrall the day and night..."

35
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:38,083
"and hold thee." And then?

36
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,416
Thirsty?

37
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,083
Oh, thank you.

38
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:44,291
Saving our asses the
way you did took a lotta guts.

39
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,041
Saved you, how?

40
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,375
Back on the ship.

41
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,416
When that weird light
shot down and engulfed us.

42
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,250
Hard port! Now!

43
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,625
Hello?! Is anyone
still down there?!

44
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:10,958
We're so screwed!

45
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,125
Shit! We're gonna die!

46
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,125
C'mon! The
ship's gonna capsize!

47
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,958
If you hadn't
forced that door open,

48
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,333
we'd be drowned
as the rest of 'em.

49
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,291
Sorry I laughed
when you were seasick.

50
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,791
That was a dick move.

51
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:34,625
Hey as near as I can tell,
you guys saved my ass, too.

52
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:35,708
But what the heck was it

53
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,791
that cleaned our
clock so bad, anyway?

54
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:41,333
Well, it came from above,
so maybe it was a satellite?

55
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,625
What a worthless tub.

56
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,833
Do we happen to know
what sank the damn thing?

57
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,583
Someone hacked the
Apollo and weaponized it.

58
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,583
The satellite
packs quite a punch.

59
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,458
Even with it downed,
that ship is problematic.

60
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,083
Covert acts of naval
aggression are a diplomatic can

61
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,916
of worms we don't want to open.

62
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,458
Just leave it be, then.

63
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,708
What?

64
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,666
If anything comes of it,
we can have the minister

65
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,625
of foreign affairs
clean up the mess.

66
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,166
You sure he's
up to the challenge?

67
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,708
If he's not, he sinks.

68
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:19,541
Such is the fate of all who
fail to do their job, is it not?

69
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:20,833
Indeed.

70
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,166
What of Medusa?

71
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,333
The typhoon that appeared this
morning is hampering our search.

72
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,625
Thus far, it hasn't
moved at all, and trying to

73
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,791
force our way through it would
be unwise to say the least.

74
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:35,083
In other words, the tiger
has led us to its den.

75
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,750
If only we could
lure it back out.

76
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,833
"How did you get up
here all by your lonesome?"

77
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,750
If you're as smart as you are
cute, I bet it was no biggie.

78
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,833
I guess it's okay
for me to talk to you,

79
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,750
since you're not a person.

80
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,458
You have one new voicemail.

81
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,291
I bet it's from Daddy!

82
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:14,583
My dearest Karin. I hope
that all is well with you.

83
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,875
Your mother and
I are both splendid.

84
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,250
'Tis work that
keeps us away from home,

85
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,000
but it still
pains us to have left you

86
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:24,291
to your own
devices for so very long.

87
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:28,250
That said, we should be
homeward bound quite soon now.

88
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,500
We're looking forward
to breaking bread with you.

89
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,375
Just like the old days.

90
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,833
Please message us
back when you get a chance.

91
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,750
We miss you. Your loving Papa.

92
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,666
Mommy. Daddy.

93
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:49,333
I want to, I do. But--

94
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,250
But it's not that simple.

95
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,000
You wanna leave, but you can't.

96
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,458
Who said that?!

97
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,958
It's true, right?
You'd love to go out.

98
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,625
H--How did you get in here?!

99
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:05,083
My security system should
have spotted you a mile away!

100
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,375
Just come outside.

101
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,500
How we pine for it.

102
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,791
If only a brief sojourn
beyond this umbral realm.

103
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:17,875
Ah, but you're still recovering
from your last "brief sojourn".

104
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,375
You really should be
more careful, sweetie.

105
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,083
We merely desire to enjoy
a walk in the light of day,

106
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,291
as innumerable others
are often want to do.

107
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,291
Is that so unreasonable
a thing for us to yearn?

108
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,583
Of course, it's not.

109
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,833
Nothing more
natural in the world, poppet.

110
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,791
Art thou well?

111
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,083
Their winged
sovereignty is precious.

112
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,625
Set yourself free!

113
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,833
It's like falling off
a log. Really, it's easy!

114
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:51,083
Now hold on, how can you
even see me through there?!

115
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:54,500
Who are you?! And why
the hell are you here anyway?

116
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,875
I've come to rescue a sad,
lonely little princess

117
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,750
who's forgotten the
words to her own song.

118
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,416
Leave! Just go away!

119
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,583
I didn't ask for rescuing.

120
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,083
And I certainly don't
need anybody's help.

121
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,083
"Won't somebody rescue me?"

122
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,625
This is precisely
where I want to be.

123
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,041
"If I could, I'd run
away from this place."

124
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:19,958
This is home, and everything
I want, I have. I'm content--

125
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:23,125
"All I want is to eat
dinner with Mommy and Daddy.

126
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,583
Why can't I?"

127
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,000
I can't, okay?!

128
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,375
Yes you can.

129
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:33,416
Don't say that! Shut up!
Please! Just leave me alone.

130
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,291
That's just not possible.
Sorry, but you

131
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,583
and I are one and the same.

132
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,333
What're you talking about?

133
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,208
Come on.

134
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,791
Stop it! Leave me alone!

135
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,833
I'm not listening,
so just go away!

136
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:07,666
And stay out! What the
hell just happened to me?!

137
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,000
What do you mean,
nobody got in?!

138
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,708
I had a conversation
with him, for crying out loud!

139
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,041
If you've been sleeping
on the job, I am not amused!

140
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,708
Well, The cameras
don't sleep, ma'am.

141
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,791
Everything is looking
pretty copasetic over here.

142
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:37,041
Sorry, but there's no trace
of anybody in the video footage.

143
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,958
What are you insinuating?!

144
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,958
Maybe you nodded off to sleep.

145
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,250
Huh?!

146
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,833
I was awake. I'm sure of it.

147
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,625
Kitty, what's your
take on the situation?

148
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:57,041
Was it just a dream?
Or was he real?

149
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:04,791
He frightened me. But he...
he wasn't exactly wrong.

150
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:08,333
That's probably the reason
he frightened me so much.

151
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,750
Now that he's gone,

152
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,083
I kinda wish I could talk
to him a little bit more.

153
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,791
I know. Real contrary, huh?

00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,958
What's taking 'em so long, huh?

161
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,625
We ain't gonna last much longer.

162
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,708
Man. If I knew that things
were gonna end this way,

163
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,083
I totally would've
hooked up with that chick.

164
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,083
C'mon, man! Suck it up!

165
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,875
Are you gonna give up
and die in a damn life-raft,

166
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,208
or you gonna go
home and seal the deal?!

167
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,791
I'm getting you
guys back home to Japan

168
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,875
if it's the last thing I do!

169
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,958
Go easy on 'em, Lieutenant.

170
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,125
We're all just trying
to keep it together.

171
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:23,208
Yeah. Sorry, I wasn't
really trying to be an asshole.

172
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,958
So, uh, speakin of chicks...

173
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:29,083
Got one wrapped around
your finger back at home?

174
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,291
Huh? Nah. Nobody
to really speak of.

175
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,375
Huh? Who, me?!

176
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,083
Come on and focus, woman!

177
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,583
You're in charge
of Metal Age now,

178
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,583
so you gotta
start acting like it!

179
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,291
Maybe I was having
deep leader thoughts.

180
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,791
Yeah? What's your
plan, fearless one?

181
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,291
Uh, what plan?

182
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,666
The plan that tell us how
we're gonna break into Atlas?!

183
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,708
It's not like
we can just wing it!

184
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,291
How 'bout this?

185
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,291
Go on!

186
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,083
Y'know, that "winging
it" thing could work!

187
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,166
Or maybe not. Hmm.

188
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,083
How did you sneak in here?

189
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,625
This place is supposed
to be impregnable.

190
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:10,291
Please don't be afraid.
I won't hurt you.

191
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,666
But, I am. Afraid.

192
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm afraid of you.
But I'm afraid of everyone.

193
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:24,375
All those people, and I'm too
afraid to even speak to them!

194
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,833
The world outside
is just scary.

195
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:28,791
I understand.

196
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,250
You don't understand!

197
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,875
How come it's so
easy for everybody else?

198
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,000
I can't even bring myself
to look a person in the eye.

199
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,208
But you can. I know it.

200
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,166
Uh-uh. It's too hard.

201
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,750
I could never just go
up and talk to a stranger!

202
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,833
That part of me
has always been broken!

203
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,500
But I'm a stranger,
and hey, you're talkin' to me.

204
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,041
You're doing just fine.

205
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,958
You think so?

206
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,458
Duh?

207
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,125
Don't make fun.

208
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,791
I'm sorry.

209
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,083
Tell me, what's that
song you were singing?

210
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,000
It's about a canary.

211
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:13,000
At the end, he remembers
the song he forgot.

212
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,791
I know it. I think.

213
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,916
I used to be
afraid of people, too.

214
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Huh?

215
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,625
I actually used
to be a lot like you.

216
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:31,250
The difference is other
people locked me away.

217
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,791
You can free
yourself at any time.

218
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,583
Karin, I'm glad
we had this talk.

219
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,416
Don't go! Just
a few more minutes.

220
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,333
Tonight, when the
sunset makes the sky all rosy,

221
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,458
come to the park out front.

222
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,291
Something you've
lost will be waiting.

223
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,791
It would seem that no
other nations were aware

224
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,750
of the Yamato
Takeru or its sinking.

225
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,333
Well that's no fun.

226
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,458
I suppose the foreign minister
will live to see another day.

227
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:15,958
Madam Ryoko.

228
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,375
The custodian of the Moon
Palace Digma has gotten rather

229
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,458
vocal lately with her concerns.

230
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,375
Is she going to
be a problem for us?

231
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,458
Tenacious bitch.
Always butting in.

232
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,250
So?

233
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,916
So let the shrew complain.

234
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,375
I do think he was
right to inquire, madam.

235
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:34,291
Maybe we should proceed a bit
more delicately with the Digmas.

236
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,666
Maybe so.

237
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,250
Madam Ryoko.

238
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:41,125
While we're on this topic, I'd
like to make a request of you.

239
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,541
Speak.

240
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,416
I'd like to have
access to any files we have

241
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,125
on the Digmas to
learn more about them.

242
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,708
Why?

243
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:52,375
As they say, "Know your enemy
as yourself, and fear nothing."

244
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:57,333
Very well. Go. Read up.

245
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,958
Well I guess I gotta
think of somethin', don't I?

246
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:33,875
Okay, here's the plan!
We bust in! Ta-daa!

247
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,041
I'm going out,
so it's up to you to

248
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:41,041
watch over everything
while I'm gone.

249
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,000
We're finally goin' home?

Yeah, I guess I did.

00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,166
And I finally remember.

260
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,416
That song, it's a-- 

261
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,708
It's a lullaby my mother
used to sing me to sleep with.

262
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,208
I knew you could do it, Karin.

263
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,875
Good bye, my little bird.

264
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,750
Such dulcet notes.

265
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,833
Pray, by what name
dost thou know yonder birds?

266
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:52,000
Ah, those little dears
are called "canaries".

267
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,750
'Tis a most beautiful name.

268
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,458
Canaries are most
fortunate to possess it.

269
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,208
See those two on the roof?

270
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,250
They were brought together
to sing just for your delight.

271
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,958
That's their purpose.

272
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,541
Verily, they sing for us alone?

273
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,541
Truly. And just like you
milady, they never venture

274
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,958
out into the
brutish light of day.

275
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:14,875
They never know of daylight?
Nor of the sun's warming glow?

276
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,166
Then more's the pity.

277
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,541
So, how goes it?

278
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,000
Found anything noteworthy?

279
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:35,000
Nothing. All the important
info is well beyond my reach.

280
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,625
Well, you had to expect that.

281
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,041
Wait a sec. There's another?

282
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,791
Never heard of Zero, huh?

283
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,000
Who's that?

284
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:50,041
That one was the
original Digma. A prototype.

285
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:54,166
Codename "Canary."
Defective model, they said.

286
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:58,000
Never once set foot outside the
facility, or so the story goes.

287
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,208
Died about five years ago.

288
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,208
So we lost one?

289
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:07,958
To die without ever having
known the outside world.
