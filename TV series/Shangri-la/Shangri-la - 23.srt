1
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,500
What in the hell're
you doing up here?

2
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,875
How'd you even get
in the room, anyway?

3
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,333
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,458
So Lady Mikuni.
Shall we make our way?

5
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,458
Hey! Hold on!

6
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:55,916
No you don't!

7
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,250
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:05,416
Is that all you
can say? "I'm sorry!"

9
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,541
What's wrong with you?!

10
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,541
Save the drama!

11
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:52,958
Momoko, you're here!

12
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,750
It's Haruko.
That's why he's doing this.

13
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,041
Bastards took his mother.

14
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:01,208
Oh my god. Is that true?!

15
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,208
That butch bitch.

16
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,583
Look, if this
is about that kiss.

17
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,666
Let me go on.
They're gonna hurt my mother

18
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,666
if I don't get up there.

19
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,666
My God.

20
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,333
Momoko, please.

21
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,000
I suppose I do
owe Haruko a favor.

22
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,333
But you hurt one little
pink hair on her head,

23
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,625
and all bets are off.

24
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,000
Sayoko!

25
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,625
Got a jumper!

26
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:44,541
Strange. You'd think a gal
this heavy'd have some tits.

27
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,500
So do you know
where she is now?

28
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,500
Ragged as she is,
she still ran off

29
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,625
looking for her pale
little charge. Ya know...

30
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,916
Loverboy feels the same.
So go easy on him.

31
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,541
I know.

32
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:04,500
Listen. If you shoot me,
will that save your mom?

33
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,458
It won't! You
know it won't!

34
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,166
I'm tryin' ta save
all of us, including her!

35
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:18,166
I am too. That's what
I've wanted to do all along.

36
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,000
I thought I was
doing the right thing.

37
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,958
That serving Atlas and Japan
was all for the greater good.

38
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,833
I know that!

39
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:29,041
Don't ya think that's what
I'm tryin' ta do right now?

40
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,583
Yeah. You're right.
Just like usual.

41
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,208
I'll do whatever ya need.

42
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,000
So cute. Like they
were made for each other.

43
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:04,041
Prithee, Lady Mikuni.
Take these sacred blades.

44
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,291
And sheathe them into
the slots you see before you.

45
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,541
Excellently done.
We're getting very close.

46
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,458
I simply cannot
abide this, Madam.

47
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,583
I ask you not continue
down this destructive path.

48
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,208
Shogo. There was a
time I valued your opinion,

49
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,166
but I fear you've gone soft.

50
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,375
It's no opinion.
It's a command!

51
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,333
Is that so?
And to think, all this time

52
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,000
I planned to let you
live after our little show.

53
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,250
Live ye shall.
We shall allow it.

54
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,583
You are to keep silent
while I am speaking!

55
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,750
Shion, darling.

56
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,500
Don't go! Shion!

57
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,541
I'm sorry, brother. Truly.

58
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,750
Wait!

59
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,750
You don't understand how I feel.

60
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:24,833
I'm not strong like you are.
No one calls on me for anything.

61
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,375
When Mom and Dad were getting
swallowed up by the jungle,

62
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:31,416
they were howling your name,
not mine! They didn't need me!

63
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,625
I have lived under your
shadow my whole damn life.

64
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:39,125
No one ever takes
notice of me. No one cares.

65
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:44,375
But Madam Ryoko. She's the only
person who makes me feel needed.

66
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,166
She counts on me
to do things for her.

67
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,416
She's the only
one who'll look at me!

68
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,000
Right you are, Shion.

69
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,083
I ask much of you.

70
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,250
And you comply so
willingly, so devotedly.

71
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:02,833
Because... You have no mind
of your own. It's disgusting.

72
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,166
Madam. Please don't.

73
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:05,958
No!

74
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,583
Brother!

75
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,666
After that speech
you still lie trembling

76
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,916
under your older
brother's strength.

77
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,125
Damn!

78
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,500
This is failure.
A feeling you'll get used to.

79
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:30,708
I suppose it has something
to do with your family's DNA.

80
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,666
That's... Godspeed.

81
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,291
Can you not even die properly?

82
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,250
I'm sorry.

83
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,791
Damnit kid! If you felt
like that you should've told me.

84
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:49,333
I didn't know.
But I do care about you!

85
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,708
You do?

86
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:59,416
Forgive me. This is more
difficult than I anticipated.

87
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,333
Where the hell is she?!

88
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,000
Let my mother go, you bastard!

89
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,166
No need to worry,
she's perfectly safe now.

90
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,541
Don't lie to me!

91
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,250
Maybe you should give
her a call and find out.

92
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,541
Like, now!

93
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:26,458
Mom?! Don't candy-coat
it, are you okay?

94
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,666
Where are you?
Wait, they're gone?

95
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,750
Where's your boss?

96
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:30,708
She escaped.

97
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:31,583
To where?

98
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,625
The Sacred Grove of Guidance.

99
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:38,291
Milady. You must not let that
vile woman stand by your side!

100
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,208
What reason have you? We seek
to become the rightful heir

101
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,833
to Atlas and she
hastens us to that end.

102
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,916
Is this not what
thou hast wished for us?

103
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,500
That is indeed my most
heartfelt wish for thee.

104
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,958
But this witch! Her
intentions are far from pure.

105
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:56,625
She will not obey you, milady!
One who intends to serve

106
00:08:56,708 --> 00:09:00,583
does not dare silence
she who would be her mistress.

107
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,833
It's true.

108
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,791
The wishes of
this disgusting creature

109
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,791
do not interest
me in the slightest.

110
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,250
How dare you?!

111
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,416
Not the warmest way to
embrace an old college friend.

112
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,291
You were never my "friend"!

113
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:20,416
Oh no! And I certainly never
considered you to be my equal.

114
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,625
After all, I'm
practically a god on Earth!

115
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,500
I attended school to
ward away interminable boredom,

116
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,083
and you provided
the juiciest amusements!

117
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,500
So studiously pursuing
a life where you could

118
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,750
cast aside those
tattered clothes.

119
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,416
But all that knowledge never
helped improve your looks.

120
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,958
Shut up!

121
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:45,458
There was one who brought
some color to those cheeks, yes?

122
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,583
Please, stop.

123
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,583
A professor, whose name
escapes me at the moment.

124
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,291
Don't trample on
the image I have of him.

125
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,875
Are you serious?

126
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,166
You still cling to those
memories? At your age?

127
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,166
No!

128
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,375
Oh dear. What was
the word he used

129
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,750
to try to describe
you in bed, "pitiful"?

130
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,083
Shut the fuck up!

131
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,333
Damnit!

132
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,125
How the hell do
we make it stop?!

133
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:14,000
I think if we pull these
out, then. Well that did it.

134
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,708
Wasn't that one
already broken at the tip?

135
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:18,708
Is it still going?

136
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:19,750
Afraid so.

137
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,750
And you don't
know how to stop it?

138
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:22,750
Get back.

139
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:25,916
Hang on!

140
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:35,250
I swear, I hate when
guys blow without warning!

141
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,000
It didn't work. Now what?

142
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,875
I've got a secret that I've just
been dying to share with you.

143
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,166
This is the perfect time.
Your Midori's affliction.

144
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,375
The one shared by
our would-be heir.

145
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,208
There is a proven
cure for it, you know.

146
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,791
That's not true.

147
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:56,291
There is. A drug that I myself
developed over seven years ago.

148
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,791
You buried it?
Midori could have taken it,

149
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:02,375
she wouldn't have had to suffer.
She'd still be alive today!

150
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:06,083
But you buried her, and been
right miserable ever since.

151
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,625
You bitch!

152
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,416
See. Always so damn weak.

153
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,000
Listen! Release
Sayoko this instant!

154
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,000
I shall grant your wish.

155
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:22,833
No!

156
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,791
Sayoko!

157
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:33,416
Prepare yourself. We shall
soon descend upon Level Zero.

158
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,500
The land of the dead.
Atlas Level Zero.

159
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,166
Our largest and
most secret discovery.

160
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,750
The cavernous heart of Atlas.

161
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:55,333
Hidden within it,
an ancient shrine.

162
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,875
What we encountered
there changed everything.

163
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,583
The artifacts.

164
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,875
The remains of Himiko.

165
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,458
The sacred bejeweled spear.

166
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:11,166
It was as if the gods had
chosen that moment to speak.

167
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,833
Indeed. And we both heard them.

168
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:18,125
They told us what was required.
What they needed from us.

169
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,833
We knew what we had
found because they told us.

170
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,916
Himiko, the spear.

171
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,708
Yes. The thought entered
our minds simultaneously,

172
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,000
but it came from neither of us.

173
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,833
I could never
hope to explain it.

174
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,000
At that moment it
became all too clear

175
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:35,125
these were valuable tools.
We could use them.

176
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:38,041
Indeed, the unearthly
accrual discovered here would

177
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,541
prove the crucible of our dream.

178
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,583
We harvested Himiko's DNA
and used it as the seed

179
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,750
from which the bio-computer,
Zeus, was fostered.

180
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,416
The bejeweled spear
became the lynchpin.

181
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,541
Yes. Placed at
the heart of Atlas,

182
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,583
it soothes the
violent tremors that

183
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,583
threaten the
tower with oblivion.

184
00:12:55,666 --> 00:13:00,291
Hiruko, the spilled blood,
and the sacred spear.

185
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,291
Using these tools we were given,

186
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,375
we could raise our monument
high into the heavens.

187
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,083
A tenuous stability.
By appeasing them,

188
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,083
we've perpetuated
the supernatural forces

189
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,166
that would destroy our dreams.

190
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,916
And now Ryoko.
What is her goal?

191
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,250
Can't say. Although
she is our creation,

192
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,583
her true motives
are far from clear.

193
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,875
She's freed herself
from our control.

194
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,916
If only we could have made
a simple terminal for Zeus.

195
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,083
But its unique composition
required the kind of

196
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,208
power that only a
lifeforce could provide.

197
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,416
It's the only way we
could revive that corpse.

198
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,708
It had to be done.
There's no future in regret.

199
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:46,500
The fact is, she's free now,
soon to learn the true cost

200
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,375
of casting aside her shackles.

201
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,083
I finally found you!

202
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,041
Oh? Took long enough.

203
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,166
We've been waiting for ages.

204
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,208
Still can't break through.

205
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,500
There's gotta be
some way to stop her.

206
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,250
Damnit!!

207
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,833
That seems
to've done the trick.

208
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,708
Alright.

209
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,000
So you're off?

210
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,416
Take care, hon.

211
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,250
Look, I'm sorry. About earlier.

212
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,166
If those goons had
threatened Momoko like that,

213
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,041
I bet I would've probably
done the exact same thing.

214
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,666
Don't beat yourself up about it.

215
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,958
Yeah? What else is new?

217
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,666
I understand what you mean,
but just promise me that

218
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,791
when I get back you'll get
over being sorry all the time.

219
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,958
Yeah, uh, sure thing.

220
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,625
Think she'll
really make it back?

221
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:11,750
Um, excuse me? That is my
daughter you're talking about.

222
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,458
It's quite unique.
When you blur gender lines,

223
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,791
you can play both
mother and father.

224
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,500
You wanna be a mommy?

225
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,916
Um. I'm not
the parenting type.

226
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,666
What's all this?

227
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,916
Nagiko!

228
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,750
We assumed the center
shaft would be sealed,

229
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,166
so we came down to
offer some assistance.

230
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,166
Kuniko's already
taken care of it.

231
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,041
We should leave
the heroics to the young.

232
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,708
There is something
we can do. Shogo?

233
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:37,875
Sir?

234
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,708
I need you to set
up a computer terminal.

235
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,416
Medusa, please. Stop this.

236
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,708
Blast it! The damn
thing seems to've established

237
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,125
a beach-head at the gateway to

238
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,208
the UN's central
defense network.

239
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,541
And if it makes its
way inside that network,

240
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,125
it'll mean the end
of the line for us.

241
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:00,125
I know! We're totally doomed!
Say your prayers, everybody!

242
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,791
Shut up! Come on
we're all smart!

243
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,708
Surely we can figure out
some way outta this, right?

244
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,541
Boo hoo.

245
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,375
There is one way.

246
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,083
Huzzah!

247
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,166
Tarsian!

248
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,458
Okay, genius.
What are we gonna do?

249
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,291
We're joining forces
to catch the beast.

250
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,000
You think it's possible to
contain Medusa at this point?

251
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,208
We have the same minds
that built the most advanced

252
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:24,833
computer system in the world at
our disposal. I and Nagiko Hojo.

253
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,083
Asian Dragon!

254
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,916
Not to mention your talents.

255
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,875
Oh wow, me too?

256
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,625
Now, let's get started!

257
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,458
Medusa!

258
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,291
You've been a very bad boy!

259
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,416
Poor thing.

260
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,250
Karin!

261
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,916
You okay?

262
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,166
Oh, yeah.
Wait! Zhang! Klaris!

263
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,041
Darling.

264
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,666
Daddy?

265
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,166
We've been gone
a long time, haven't we?

266
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,958
You've been behaving?

267
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,250
Mommy! Daddy!

268
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,500
Who's there?! Who are
you talking to, Karin?

269
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,250
Someone has
rerouted her connection.

270
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,625
She's been intercepted.

271
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:30,791
I don't know who or from where,

272
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,458
but they've
blocked her off from us.

273
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,625
Damnit.

274
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,833
It appears our connection with
Medusa has been severed as well.

275
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:45,041
I'm so glad to see you.
I've missed you so much.

276
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,708
Please, forgive us, dear.

277
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,541
The last few years have
been rather tough on you.

278
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,666
Are you two finally
gonna come home?

279
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,750
That's rather
complicated, sweetie.

280
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,541
We wanted to
talk to you about it.

281
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,625
Did something else come up?

282
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,458
Your mother and I...
Well the truth of the matter is

283
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,125
we're not "around" anymore.

284
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:06,208
What your father's trying
to say is we died, pumpkin.

285
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,625
Now, promise you'll stay
out of trouble for us, alright?

286
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,041
And If you're good,

287
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,041
when we get back we'll
all go out for a nice dinner.

288
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,708
You can even bring
little Pudding along, okay?

289
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,916
Bye! I love you!

290
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,583
After Mommy and Daddy's
plane went into the sky

291
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,250
we ran into some
really bad weather.

292
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,625
The pilot tried
as hard as he could,

293
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,041
but the plane
dropped into the ocean.

294
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,083
It was all over the news,
so it was hard to make sure

295
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,750
you didn't ever hear about it.

296
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,500
I guess we
succeeded with that, eh?

297
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,750
Daddy. What are you saying?

298
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,625
You see. We knew that
you already had the idea

299
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,375
for Medusa, and we didn't
want anything to distract you

300
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,458
from the work you were doing.
I bet you didn't know we knew,

301
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,541
but we know everything,
right, Mother?

302
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,083
Oh yes. This whole thing
has just been a game.

303
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,000
A lie so we could use you and
Medusa to get what we wanted.

304
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,750
Mommy. Daddy.
I don't understand.

305
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,333
Why'd you
do this to me?

306
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,666
I've been so lonely
waiting for you to come home.

307
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,791
We really thought
you'd figure it out.

308
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,750
You made it so easy.
Any normal girl would have

309
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:14,083
left the house at some point.
But you had no friends,

310
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,500
and no one cared that
you sat alone inside all day.

311
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,500
No. This is all a stupid lie!

312
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:20,750
Oh?

313
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,583
It's all true.

314
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,708
What the--?

315
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:37,708
It's an enemy cyberattack!
Some kind of news article.

316
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:41,916
An airline tragedy.
Huge loss of life, if I recall.

317
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,166
"Airplane crash". "Victims
include Japanese couple".

318
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,541
"Kosuke Ishida, and his
wife Kanon". Hold on!

319
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,833
Sorry. No mailbox
here by that name.

320
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,250
Mommy. Daddy.

321
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,875
No mailbox here
by that name. Sorry.

322
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:01,958
 Please, no.

323
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,375
Sorry. No mailbox
here by that name.

324
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:09,583
Sorry. No mailbox
here by that name.

325
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,875
Sorry. No mailbox
here by that name.

326
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:12,958
Please.

327
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:16,000
Sorry. No mailbox
here by that name.

328
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,166
Sorry. No mailbox
here by that name.

329
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,458
Sorry. No mailbox
here by that name.

330
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,750
Sorry. No mailbox
here by that name.

331
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:29,375
No. No!

332
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:33,250
They're gone. I'm all alone.

333
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,250
It's true. You're right.

334
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,958
I'm afraid your
lot in life is to be

335
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,583
one forever
shrouded in solitude.

336
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,333
Now. You must grab the
sacred spear, hold it aloft,

337
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,291
and then place it back upright.

338
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:52,916
Do this, and you shall be
regaled by all as true heir.

339
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,791
Never.

340
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:54,958
What?

341
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,375
Never. Until Sayoko
is returned to us

342
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:00,750
unharmed we shall
refuse. Return her now!

343
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,708
You caterwauling
infant. Fine, then.

344
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,041
If you do not
wish to do as I ask,

345
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,166
then I must rid myself of you.

346
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,375
Dost thou threaten us?

347
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:14,000
Do not forget we gathered
the three talisman blades!

348
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:17,500
Yes, but now that the doorway
to this tomb has been opened,

349
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:21,250
I no longer require them.
What I require is for

350
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:25,208
someone to draw the damned
spear. It need not be you.

351
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,291
Now!

352
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,416
Yes. That's the proper attitude.

353
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,666
Medusa has broken
through the U.N. firewall

354
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,291
and is rapidly gaining
control of their network.

355
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,416
Is this the end for all of us?

356
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,208
Oh, yes. We are
at its inception.

357
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,666
The genesis of my world.

358
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,458
You're going down!

359
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:46,583
Say what you will
about the world we live in,

360
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,833
but there's so
much worth saving.

361
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:51,625
These may be dark times,
but the dawn is coming.

362
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:53,166
The sun will
shine again on those

363
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,291
who still believe in its light.

364
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,708
Next time: "Our Shangri-La"
