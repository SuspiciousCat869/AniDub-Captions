1
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,875
If all of us
could live in there,

2
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:42,125
we outliers wouldn't
have to suffer anymore.

3
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:16,291
What?! No! Why did
Saudi Arabia drop?!

4
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,666
How the hell should I know?

5
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,166
You're the one who's
controlling Medusa, aren't you?

6
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,916
Yeah, but you're the
system engineer! Son of a--!

7
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,333
Enough with
the finger-pointing!

8
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,416
We need to figure
out who did this!

9
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,041
Who else even
could, besides us?!

10
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,125
How fares the painted sumo?

11
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,666
They're thick as
thieves, it would seem.

12
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,916
We're shocked at how easily
she passed Lady Mikuni's trial.

13
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,208
She is quite
unlike the rest of us.

14
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,250
A lady-in-waiting?

15
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,833
Miiko. Do help us to our feet.

16
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,500
Uh, right!

17
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,791
Ah, but we have
grown ever so fond of thee!

18
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:09,375
Our heart beats with such
serenity whene'er thou art near.

19
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,791
Lady Mikuni, I--

20
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:14,291
Thou art the kiln that
fires our soul's comfort.

21
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,625
Such warmth in my breast!

22
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:21,000
This must be what it feels
like to become a mother.

23
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,250
A mother, thou say.

24
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,833
Where is yours, Milady?
I haven't seen her.

25
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,708
Oh, I'm so sorry!
That's none of my business.

26
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,791
God, I am such a nosy old biddy.

27
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,791
We've but one memento. Behold.

28
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,875
Only this remains of her.

29
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,833
My word. I've seen
one like it, but where?

30
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,250
Order up! Number 89!

31
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,958
Coming! And just in time!

32
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,166
One protein
lunch combo-- eat up!

33
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,958
I'm stacked hon, not stupid.
Where's the rest of it?

34
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:59,000
Had to cut the portions.
Stuff is getting hard to find.

35
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,458
Whatta crock.

36
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,875
Glad you slurp, else I wouldn't
know you're alive over there.

37
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:12,875
Huh?!

38
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,250
Afternoon, fellas.

39
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,875
Nobody said you could sit there!

40
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,166
What are you the
goddamn lunch police!

41
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,333
Look, I'm sorry,
but, making eyes at you

42
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:23,125
from across the
room is just too hard.

43
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,958
Thanks a lot!

44
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,291
Ah! By the way,
did anybody tell you

45
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,750
about our
misadventure in Atlas?

46
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,750
It was an utter fiasco.

47
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,083
Our fake IDs weren't
worth a used merkhin,

48
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,416
and ol' Takehiko here put
his hand square on my ass--

49
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,125
This is serious! Tell me the
truth. Did it piss you off?

50
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:46,041
Seein' so much space?! They
weren't even using it all!

51
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,250
Go on.

52
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,083
Keepin' Atlas to
themselves is an outrage.

53
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,208
We should flatten the place!

54
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:58,041
All you carnivores harbor
such a boner for conflict.

55
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,541
I know that Kuniko
felt the same way I did!

56
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,875
She's got her
priorities straight!

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,458
Wanna bet?

58
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,875
Hey, Kuniko!

59
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,541
What? You really
snuck into Atlas?

60
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,083
Uh-huh.

61
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,791
That's crazy. I wish you'd stop
hanging out with those guys.

62
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,541
Sorry. I guess
that I should, but--

63
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,125
So, uh, what's it like?

64
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,875
I couldn't make any sense of it.

65
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:36,958
Huh?

66
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,458
The houses and
streets were all so big.

67
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,750
There's enough
room in there for us.

68
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:45,791
So how come we're stuck
scraping by in Duomo, huh?

69
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,208
Yeah, it's not fair.

70
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:51,041
If you had your choice,
would you wanna live in Atlas?

71
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,708
Well, duh! Who doesn't?

72
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:53,791
But I don't think they're ever

73
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,208
gonna pull my
name out of that hat.

74
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:59,541
I bet someday Hiro and I are
gonna live up there together.

75
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,458
Wait a sec. Who's this Hiro?

76
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,958
Oh, didn't I tell you?

77
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,208
What happened to
the other guy?

78
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:08,791
What about me? Here or there?

79
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,708
Talk to me, Karin!
Did you find anything yet?!

80
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,250
Hold your horses.

81
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,291
I'm only hacking into every
financial institution on Earth.

82
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,416
Help me.

83
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,750
What? What is it?!

84
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:27,750
Help me. Help me.
Help me. Help me. Help me.

85
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,375
Medusa looks pretty rough.

86
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,458
This is no time
to feel sorry for it.

87
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,250
Pull out now, and
we're as good as red-handed.

88
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,083
I found the transaction log!

89
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,166
For real?!

90
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,666
Undoing it'll
only take a one second.

91
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,916
Ooh! Great job, Karin!
Crisis averted!

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,833
Help me. Help me.

93
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,000
Well what did you expect?

94
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:52,083
Help me. Help me. Help me.

95
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:55,708
Something's weird, I've never
seen Medusa this scared before.

96
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,166
That last trade
did raise the water

97
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,958
around it by a quarter-inch.

98
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,000
The odds were pretty
grim, but it survived.

99
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,083
I bet it'll be
more careful from now on.

100
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,791
Now what gives
with the ginormous drop

101
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,416
in the Saudi carbon index?

102
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,791
Huh?

103
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,500
All that thinking sure
does make a girl hungry!

104
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,041
Hey, wait.

105
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,708
How come grandma's not gettin'
on my case for chowin' down?

106
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,708
Shoulda guessed.

107
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,083
This is strange.

108
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,208
Saudi Arabia's carbon index?

109
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,916
That's right.
There's a fair bit

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,666
of movement
here I can't explain.

111
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,958
I hear you went to Atlas.

112
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,666
Yeah.

113
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,375
What all'd you see there?

114
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,791
I saw hope, I guess.

115
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:57,000
But I haven't got a clue what
I'm supposed to do about it.

116
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,916
You just see if you can't
hash out your feelings, girl.

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,375
I'm sure life'll make you
choose a path soon enough.

118
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:13,083
Yes, right there! That's it!
Move down a bit, why don't you?

119
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,625
Not that far!

120
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,875
Please! Ma'am,
I beg your forgiveness!

121
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:25,708
Forgiveness must be
earned, you grabby worm.

122
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:29,208
Ah, yes. I'll let
you run an errand for me.

123
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,208
With luck, you'll survive.

124
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,500
The situation in
Atlas has gotten worse.

125
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,208
The three of us were lucky to
get out of there in one piece!

126
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,750
'cause those trigger-happy
don't give a shi--

127
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,208
Listen up guys! I got
a proposal for the group!

128
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,666
So you just barge right in?

129
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,750
You're finally gonna
join Metal Age. I knew it!

130
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,208
I need a yes-or-no
answer on the double.

131
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,166
I wanna sell off some
of our graphite store.

132
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,500
But why now?
What's the damn hurry?

133
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,750
Graphite's worth
the same to everyone!

134
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,666
Nothing on Earth's
worth the same to everyone.

135
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,250
Sure it's important
now, but back in the day,

136
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,500
most people cared more about
pulp or firewood than graphite.

137
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,958
But some folks saw which
way the wind was blowing.

138
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:17,000
They predicted the rise
of the carbon-based economy.

139
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,250
So they banded together,
sold their land,

140
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,625
and bought up
all of the graphite

141
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,125
they could get their paws on.

142
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,541
And your point is?

143
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,333
The economy's been all
fluctuate-y lately, hasn't it?

144
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,250
It's time to grab the bull by
the horns and make a big move!

145
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,041
If we want to take
over Atlas, we're gonna need

146
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:35,458
some serious money, guys.
Without it, we're D.O.A.!

147
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,333
Yeah! You called it!

148
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:41,666
This is our lucky day! Kuniko
finally started giving a crap!

149
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:46,166
This isn't taking produce
to market. Tell me your plan.

150
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,458
Selling it all off
at once is too dangerous.

151
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,625
With the huge
stockpile Duomo's sitting on,

152
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,625
let's start with three percent.

153
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,541
Very well.

154
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:56,958
Yeah now we're talkin'.

155
00:09:57,041 --> 00:10:00,333
Akihabra's a hot market.
So who do we send?

156
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,875
I got this, grandma!

157
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:02,708
Huh?!

158
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:03,875
No way, short stack.

159
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,125
You've never even been there!

160
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,500
It ain't no place
for a kid, trust me.

161
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm afraid he's right.
I can't let you go.

162
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,541
Huh? But why?!
C'mon, Ironside! I--!

163
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,541
The answer is no!

164
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,500
The poor thing. You think
he'll last beyond a minute?

165
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,291
I doubt it.

166
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:33,208
I'm honored to be here
in your presence, Lady Mikuni.

167
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:38,666
Gazing upon your noble face
is a sight I won't forget!

168
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,416
Pray tell, what brings
you before us on this day?

169
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,125
Madam Ryoko ordered me here.

170
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:48,583
I'm to inquire about your
mood and report back to her.

171
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:52,291
Oh? Ryoko is as cruel
a shrew as ever she was.

172
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:56,125
What sayest thou? Is this
a word befitting thy mistress?

173
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,375
M-My mistress, is--

174
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,125
Falsehood will cost you much.

175
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,625
But know you that I shall
speed your words to her ear.

176
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,708
A lie condemns him,
but the truth delivers him

177
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:12,958
to no less painful a fate,
like as not. His doom is nigh.

178
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:19,291
My, my mistress, is,
very much a shrew.

179
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,833
So you say.

180
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,375
She will hear of this.

181
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,916
And for that candid remark,
you'll know your share of pain.

182
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,750
Is this so?
Thy mistress will rebuke you

183
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,500
over that
which you have said?

184
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,625
Without a doubt.

185
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,416
And fear you this?

186
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:42,625
In truth, milady,
I do not. It is a pleasure.

187
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:43,791
He's a dead man.

188
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,125
Farewell, false one.

189
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,500
Hold up, dammit!

190
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,250
Who made you the
queen of graphite?!

191
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,125
This is a job for Metal Age!

192
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,583
Hearing you
yell at me about it

193
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,625
makes me wanna do
it even more, y'know.

194
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,458
Simmer down.
I'm going as her bodyguard.

195
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,083
Fine! You can go!
But not by your lonesomes!

196
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,125
I'm coming with you!

197
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,333
I don't think so.

198
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,291
On this job, the fewer
involved the better.

199
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:19,166
If you tag along, we're gonna
stick out like a sore thumb.

200
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,708
A sore thumb nobody's
gonna mess with.

201
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,791
See ya!

202
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,250
Stay on your toes, y'hear me?!

203
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,958
They're a rough
crowd over there!

204
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,083
I get it.

205
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,166
Get what?

206
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,833
There has to be
another Medusa system.

207
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,000
It's the only
explanation that makes sense.

208
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,666
Nu-uh. That's crazy-talk!

209
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,583
Yeah. It seems
like it'd be impossible.

210
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,750
But the whole damn set-up
is exactly the same.

211
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,958
Right down to the
tax haven sub-routine!

212
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,541
Which means somebody
pirated all of our code!

213
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,125
What are we gonna do?

214
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,583
I'm gonna find this jerk! If I
get a look at their hardware,

215
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:55,458
I might be able to track
down where it was bought.

216
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,666
Good thinking!

217
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,708
I'll do some poking
around on my end, too!

218
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,875
Ready to go, Pudding?

219
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,916
"Yeah! Code-corsairs beware!"

220
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,083
Alright smart guy. It's on.

221
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,958
Cheap, tasty, and fast!

222
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,166
French food without
the French 'tude!

223
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,875
Who says a budget massage can't
make your dreams come true?

224
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,458
Whoa, so crazy!

225
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,583
This place hasn't changed a bit.

226
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,250
Hey, folks. I'm the
Akihabra Fairy, Gina!

227
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,625
I was walking through town one
day when a strange teddy bear

228
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,541
turned me into a
cute little witch girl!

229
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,833
I gotta find
the Akihabra King!

230
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,541
I don't understand.

231
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,708
Why hasn't she broken him yet?

232
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,000
He still lives because

233
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,125
everything he
said was the truth.

234
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,833
An honest man?

235
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,541
Thou art a fellow
passing strange.

236
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,125
It would please us for thee
to speak at greater length.

237
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,625
With what pursuits
dost thou pass thine days?

238
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,916
Uh, right! Well, then.

239
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,041
I guess I'll tell you what
I had for breakfast this--

240
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,666
Do not benumb
our ears with that.

241
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,250
Uh. How about one of
my many punishments, then?

242
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:22,375
Spare us such talk! Surely thine
tongue can speak of much better.

243
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:27,583
Uh, okay. Ah yes. There was a
battle on the surface recently.

244
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,875
Go on! Tell us more!
What of this battle?

245
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,250
Yes ma'am! It was said
that during the skirmish,

246
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,625
one of the army
lieutenants noticed

247
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,291
a strange hum
emanating from his dagger.

248
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:41,416
And the blade. Why did
it behave in such a way?

249
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,041
I apologize. What I told
you is all I know about it.

250
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,333
Thou hast but
half a tale. Thus,

251
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,291
findest thou this lieutenant
and bring him to our chamber.

252
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:54,041
Huh? You mean me personally?

253
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,791
Bring him hence,
and do not tarry.

254
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,791
Yes ma'am!

255
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,416
Huh?! Who are
those weirdos, anyhow?

256
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,833
Oh, great.
Now they're transforming?!

257
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:08,541
C'mon, I didn't
sign on for this!

258
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,708
Carbon, carbon,
I'm so charmin'!

259
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,500
I'm gonna kick these
creeps right in the assets!

260
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,541
Don't be afraid.
Just think of 'em as doormen.

261
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,416
Act like you belong here.

262
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,625
"First Love, or
Financial Derring-Do?!"

263
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,125
Coming to your
TVs this summer!

264
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,875
What the Hell is this?

265
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,000
The bee's knees, sweet pea.
All the chaos you can eat.

266
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,875
They don't care
where you're from,

267
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,375
or what's between your legs.

268
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,958
Whatever you want,
Akihabara's got it in spades!

269
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,750
Nowhere in Asia are you gonna
find a bigger black market!

270
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:51,000
In other words,
it's a paradise with something

271
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,708
to scratch every itch!

272
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,333
Uh...

273
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,291
Hey! Smells tasty, don't it!

274
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,125
Care for some chicken,
fresh off the grill? It's local!

275
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,083
Uh-oh. That sure is
giving off a lot of smoke!

276
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,750
Isn't she worried about
the Carbon Police at all?

277
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,416
Oh crap, here they come now.

278
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,250
That lady's gonna
get herself pinched!

279
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,541
You sure about that?

280
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,041
Uh.

281
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:16,000
Why hello, officers! Walking
the ol' carbon beat, I see?

282
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,458
Hey, what's all
this supposed to be?

283
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,291
You know how many laws
you're breaking right here?!

284
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,875
Dear me! It's just
a little steam. Right?

285
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:25,958
It looks like steam to me.

286
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,916
Thank you, sir!
Have a lovely day!

287
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,041
See? Cash is king here, hon.

288
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,500
Guess so. Looks like it.

289
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:40,208
Speaking of cash, we have
some of our own to collect.

290
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,166
Well, this place
is nice and sketchy.

291
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,583
Whoa. Check it out!

292
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,083
These pervs're
a pain in the ass,

293
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:55,166
but I am not paying
for bum merchandise.

294
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,750
Target lock! Target lock!

295
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,583
Momoko sighted off
our twelve o'clock!

296
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,416
Whoa! A real live
girl in a sailor outfit!

297
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,958
What the--?!

298
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,041
Three dusty farts that have
been here since the stone age.

299
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:16,833
Yup. Old Man Army, Old Man
Perv and Old Man Camera.

300
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,875
They sure are unique.

301
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,166
That's one way of putting it.

302
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,166
What brings you down into our
bunker, me arch-nemesis Momoko?

303
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,041
I'm here to get a
refund on this piece of shit!

304
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,708
In order to build a
system identical to Medusa,

305
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,625
you'd need the same
Yasuda Electronics

306
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:42,041
military-spec
660 nano-processor.

307
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,750
"Isn't the
Akihabara black market

308
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,750
the only place to get one?"

309
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,958
Right you are.
Which is why the two of us

310
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:51,041
are combing through all the
sales records from Akihabara.

311
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,375
We're also tracking
incoming customer data,

312
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,250
to see who's
shopping right now.

313
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,875
"Data not available?"

314
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,375
Who're you?

315
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,791
We'd be willing to pay good
money for badges that work,

316
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,458
but when we tried
to use these things,

317
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,958
it nearly cost us our lives.

318
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,583
They got blown
out of the water!

319
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,916
Just like when the
Baltic Fleet got ripped apart

320
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,541
by Admiral Togo's
deadly T-formation!

321
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:24,333
That wasn't Togo, fool!
Akiyama put the plan together!

322
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,416
And it's the "Tei formation,"
if you wanna split hairs.

323
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,375
Don't go changing the subject!

324
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,500
Check out this
anime cell drawn by

325
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,708
a legendary mech
designer. Isn't it cool?!

326
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,083
Sorry, Perv.
You can't distract me.

327
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,083
You're issuing us a
full refund, understood?!

328
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,250
How did these three
crazies forge our fake IDs?

329
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,333
It's hard to believe,
but they run one of the best

330
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,458
black market
operations in town.

331
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,958
They support
their respective hobbies

332
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,583
by counterfeiting
documents, et cetera.

333
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,333
Oh yeah? How long've
they been doing it?

334
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,791
Good question.

335
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,083
It's quite the tale, young'un.

336
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,958
If you're up to hearin' it.

337
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,166
You're making me
work for this damn refund.

338
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,708
Oh yeah! Fire away!

339
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,333
'Twas Year Zero, Atlas Time!

340
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,458
No such thing.

341
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,708
It's the year they
started building Atlas!

342
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,083
Following right on the heels

343
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,625
of the Second
Great Kanto Earthquake!

344
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,125
So you guys lived
through the quake?!

345
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:34,000
Those were days that
tested every otaku's mettle.

346
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,583
Uh, o-kay.

347
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,583
Just gimmie the damn money!

348
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,500
And when this
force of nature,

349
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,000
this earthquake, struck us.

350
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,708
All our
collections were wiped out!

351
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,541
But then, we were hit
with further catastrophes!

352
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,250
Riots! Volcanoes! Tidal waves!

353
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,583
Anything you can think
of that would put a damper

354
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,791
on pursuing a hobby,
we faced it all!

355
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,333
All of a sudden,
the Atlas Plan

356
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,875
rose from the
ashes like a phoenix!

357
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,875
The thought of such a place
filled humanity with hope,

358
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,541
and the three of
us were no different!

359
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,125
But then we realized...

360
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,666
that in Atlas...

361
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,875
there wouldn't
be any Akihabra.

362
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:25,500
Then and there,
we three made a pact.

363
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,166
We'd build our
fortress on this very spot

364
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,375
and remain here forever!

365
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,166
Story time is over!

366
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,791
Stop trying to
snow us with talk about

367
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:40,500
the good ol' days
and give us our money! Now!

368
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,708
Regardless of what
I'm packing downstairs,

369
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,333
the lights are
on up above, so...

370
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,708
We're not getting
off easy, are we?

371
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:55,166
That girl, what's her story?

372
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,791
Wait here for a sec.

373
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,041
Hey, knock-knock.

374
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,708
What's my little
friend workin' with?

375
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:17,958
Huh?!

376
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,416
Thirty-one, twenty-one,
thirty-three, correct?

377
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,458
I'm guessing
she'll be a late bloomer.

378
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,958
One-hundred
percent pure graphite.

379
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,958
And I have thirty-five hundred
more tons where that came from.

380
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,875
Great little
sample you got there.

381
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,500
So. How do you want your pay?

382
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,666
Eighty percent in cash.
And the rest of it in weapons.

383
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,125
Be a doll and throw in
some lipstick, would ya?

384
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,583
For you, anything.
I'll be right back.

385
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,500
Never hurts to try
and get a little extra.

386
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,958
Hey, is this the
junk shop called Ceto?

387
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:59,625
It's the rathole in the back.
Jesus, get your shops straight!

388
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,041
Sorry 'bout that.

389
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,583
What's up, hon?

390
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,916
When two people from
different worlds first meet,

391
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,416
not knowing
anything about each other,

392
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,166
is it a given they'll scrape
shields like old enemies?

393
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:56,958
Next time:
"Wild Dance of Madness"
