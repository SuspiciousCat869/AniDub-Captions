1
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,458
Check out that eclipse!

2
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,500
Wonder if it means
we're gonna get snow.

3
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:30,208
Fine with me, I'll take
that over hail any day.

4
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,833
'Scuse me, ladies!

5
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,041
There's digging to do!
We gotta spring Kuniko

6
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,708
so get your shovels in your
hands and your asses in gear.

7
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,000
Yessir!

8
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,458
♪ Girls and boys
rush out to play. ♪

9
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:22,208
♪ The moon doth
shine as bright as day. ♪

10
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,750
♪ Leave your supper,
leave your sleep. ♪

11
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:29,000
♪ Join thy friends in yonder
street. Come with needle, ♪

12
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:32,916
♪ come with thread.
Bring thou joy or go to bed. ♪

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,541
Over there!

14
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:38,625
Oh! This belongs to dear Miiko!

15
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,833
Lady Mikuni,
are you all right?!

16
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:44,666
Thou robbed us of our fall!
We sue for recompense!

17
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,625
As you please, child.
Whenever you're ready.

18
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,416
Oh what a precious
little imp you are.

19
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,041
What thinkest thou?

20
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,041
Will stars tumble from the sky?

21
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,083
For we yearn
to catch sight of one.

22
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,500
Let's ask Old
Man Sky to toss them.

23
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:05,208
The more shooting stars you see,
the more wishes he'll give you.

24
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,291
A single wish would suffice us.

25
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:11,041
A wish we hold most dear,
to explore the surface

26
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,291
whilst the sun
shines above. Just once.

27
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:19,833
Oh, my poor dear. You should
wish for more tickling!

28
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,958
No, Miiko!
Please! We surrender!

29
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,541
Please tell me I'm not the
only one who's seeing all this.

30
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,333
Are you talking
about Medieval Japan

31
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,833
in the middle of the road?

32
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,041
Owww.

33
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,125
Just shooting off
without any sort of warning.

34
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,583
Well, no second
date for you, buddy!

35
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,375
Fleet of foot.

36
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,875
So are we free to
take them out, ma'am?

37
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,583
Quite.

38
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,833
But deliver the woman unto me.

39
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,458
Alive?

40
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,583
There's more pleasure to
be had when they're aware.

41
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:01,833
Yes ma'am.

42
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,333
A strapping young
lass such as this one here.

43
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:09,708
I can increase the
concentration two-hundredfold!

44
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,458
Our celebration
came to an abrupt end.

45
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:16,833
Sayoko wants you in here 'til
the bad guys are taken out.

46
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,791
"Bad guys?!" We wish
to espy these villains!

47
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:23,166
No, Milady.
It's far too dangerous!

48
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,416
Mo. Let's just run.
These guys aren't messin around.

49
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,833
And run away from all
those scrumptious soldiers?

50
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,333
Sorry, there is just
too much fun to be had.

51
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,541
Yeah, sure.

52
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,333
This harmless stroll
has sealed your fate, stranger.

53
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,750
You are the
queen of misfortune.

54
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,916
'Fraid not, honey.

55
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,958
I don't know who you think
you are, but you really stepped

56
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,750
in the shit when you
decided to tangle with me.

57
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,833
Hope your affairs're in order,

58
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:07,416
'cause these are weapons
of mass double-D-struction!

59
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,833
You're delusional
in a variety of ways!

60
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,208
Oh no. Big mama
doesn't like anyone

61
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,625
to take the spotlight
away from her. Give it back!

62
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:23,208
Rawr. Someone's been
working on their pecs!

63
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,458
You freak!

64
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,500
No need to jump the gun. You're
all gonna get a turn, boys.

65
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,791
Good night. I had fun.

66
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,708
Anybody else want
a ticket to paradise?

67
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,291
No way!

68
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,208
Oh, man. Now what?

69
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,791
We hafta help.

70
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,500
But she's havin' so much fun.

71
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,250
Yeah, I know! Look, if
we don't do something quick,

72
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,250
she's gonna bad-touch
'em all with a capital B!

73
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,291
You look important!

74
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,666
You're all right, dear!

75
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,041
Come get me, you old hag.

76
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,708
I'm more of a
woman than you'll ever be!

77
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,083
No! Don't stop!

78
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:31,875
Call me more names!
Humiliate me! I deserve it!

79
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,791
Domination's
gonna cost you, honey.

80
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:38,041
I get it. You're just
a little tease!

81
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:41,583
I'm going to have such
fun cutting you to ribbons!

82
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,041
I've been under
the knife plenty.

83
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,916
You should try it!
Get yourself some tits!

84
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,916
Don't you fret, Milady.
Miiko is here to protect you!

85
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,875
Wilt thou battle them?

86
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:56,916
Believe it or not, I was
a sumo with the Yamagatakeh!

87
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,875
Allll-right.

88
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:05,000
Dose-koi!

89
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,000
A boomerang?!

90
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:14,375
How did they block--?
She did that?!

91
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,125
Tomoka!

92
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,833
Please return to
your cart, Lady Mikuni!

93
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,250
Miiko!

94
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:33,791
Spacing out is a
good way to lose a fight.

95
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,333
So it would seem.

96
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,000
Tomoka, hang in there!

97
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,000
Ow. It hurts.

98
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,833
Momoko! No!

99
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,791
I won't let you
bastards take her!

100
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,208
What in the--?

101
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,166
Huh?! What the hell?!

102
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,916
Momoko. I don't
wanna be alone!

103
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,541
Please don't leave me!

104
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:25,208
Momoko! Please
come back! Momokoooo!

105
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,041
The Sun and the
Moon have parted ways.

106
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:42,166
I wager our Hiruko
should be privy to that.

107
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,458
Sayoko's forces captured
Digma Two's guardian.

108
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,500
Her captives tend to perish.

109
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,375
Oh, let her have her fun.
If she oversteps herself,

110
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,000
we'll just send her
to the corner for a bit.

111
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,291
Get out... All of you.

112
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,875
Are you deaf?!

113
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,833
No. Please forgive me.

114
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,083
What? Who the hell
uses a payphone these days?

115
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,208
Incoming collect
call from Frankfurt.

116
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,083
Do you accept the charges?

117
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,250
I suppose.

118
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,791
Money Karin! Now!

119
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,541
Hey look, Pudding-- It's Klaris.
Our poverty-stricken pal.

120
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,708
Don't call me
"poverty-stricken!"

121
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,291
It's her, all right.

122
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,791
I'm hurting out here!

123
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,208
You know how hard
it is to find a payphone?!

124
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,541
Being poor totally sucks!
And then God steals the sun,

125
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,791
the one free thing I can
enjoy, with a dumb eclipse?

126
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,166
An eclipse?

127
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,666
I had some bread yesterday
from, y'know, a soup-kitchen!

128
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,708
I was a carbon baroness,
and now I'm on the dole!

129
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,333
Looks like she's right.

130
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,166
Well maybe you'll listen
to me next time around.

131
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:54,125
I should hit up a convent.
Nuns get fed, don't they?

132
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,208
Why so glum, my little pauper?

133
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,833
I'm about to wire three
million into your bank account.

134
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,083
Wait, that's it?!

135
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,416
Ugh, I've blown
through more on lunch!

136
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,083
Someone needs to diet!

137
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,083
How about thirty?
Will that be enough?

138
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,750
Oh! I love you, Karin!

139
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:08,833
Thank-you-thank-you-thank-you!

140
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,125
Calm down!
Consider it an advance.

141
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,541
Huh?!

142
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:16,083
Listen. I need a favor,
and you're gonna do it for me.

143
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,125
"MEDUSA"?

144
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,833
Rise an' shine, sleepyhead.

145
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:42,458
Hey, c'mon!
I can walk! I'm fine! Oww!

146
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,833
Soon as we're home,
we'll get you all patched up.

147
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,583
Sorry.

148
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,041
It's all good. Seriously.

149
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,250
Stop saying
"sorry" all the time!

150
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,291
No. I mean about, Momoko.

151
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,166
Nah! No worries!
You know Momoko.

152
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,458
She'll be back in a week with
a butt-load of tacky souvenirs!

153
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,708
Hope so.

154
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:06,208
Sure she will! You should stop
bein' such a worrywart, too!

155
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,625
Besides, we got
a jailbreak to focus on!

156
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,000
I can't wait to see the
look on that blond bitch's face

157
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,666
when I give her the what-for!

158
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,833
"The what-for?"

159
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,750
Damn straight the what-for!

160
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:19,500
That is, if my
arms don't fall off first.

161
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,958
You were pigging out back
in the big house, weren't ya?

162
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,125
Geez, it's like
I'm carrying Miiko!

163
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,333
You are such a butt!

164
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,208
You know I'm just
yanking your chain!

165
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,291
You're light as
a feather back there!

166
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,125
Lady Mikuni, she
could rest elsewhere.

167
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,458
She can't!

168
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,208
If she should awaken
and find us not at her side,

169
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,291
her fears will run amok!

170
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,708
'bout time you came back.

171
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,625
I had to amuse myself for a bit

172
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,125
with that poor little
lamb you had guarding me.

173
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,416
Did you fleece him
of anything worthwhile?

174
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,833
Thirty-three bust, twenty-six
waist, thirty-four hips.

175
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,458
Not much to
write home about, sister.

176
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,083
So I disappoint?

177
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,333
Rock a kimono
and no one can tell.

178
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:22,041
But I assume you didn't bring
me here to get fashion advice.

179
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,833
I mean, we're in Atlas.

180
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,041
My assistant
told you that as well?

181
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,083
No, I can feel it in my skin.

182
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,583
You wanna
touch it, for science?

183
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:35,333
Too bad! Absolutely no handling
the merchandise in this club!

184
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,666
Down, girl! Lesbians
don't do it for me!

185
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,458
That earring you have on!
Where did you acquire it?!

186
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:45,666
Oh that? Gotemba Outlet Mall!

187
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:50,833
Well! I'm not above digging
for clues if you won't tell me.

188
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:54,833
I can be painfully
inquisitive if the need arises.

189
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:07,208
The Moon has truly encountered
the Sun. You witnessed this?!

190
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:12,125
Yes. Exactly as you prophesized
twelve generations ago.

191
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,958
Then those children
are truly the ones.

192
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,833
The long-foretold
heirs who will

193
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,458
bring forth light
unto this world!

194
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,791
They will establish
harmony on Earth!

195
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,958
Seven whole years.

196
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,291
She endured it
longer than most.

197
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:38,166
Bring the next vessel!
Before his essence takes flight!

198
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,916
No! Let me go!
Please! I'm begging you!

199
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,750
Giving one's self
over to this fate

200
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,333
is an honor the likes
of which you cannot grasp.

201
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,875
I don't want to become Hiruko!

202
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:52,375
Please don't do this
to me! I'd rather die! No!

203
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,250
The purification of
the within and the without

204
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,791
Help me!

205
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,541
living within the hearth.
Sweep away all that is

206
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,583
unclean purify the
six roots of our being.

207
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,458
May the young deer
raise his ears to our prayer,

208
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,625
deliver it to
the innumerable gods,

209
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:14,458
that they may grant our request.
We beg this of the divine.

210
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,791
What do you mean he refused
to carry out an order?!

211
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,125
I checked and
the shutdown command was

212
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,958
routed through all
the right subroutines.

213
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,875
It was like it just
didn't feel like doing it.

214
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,208
Well, check it again!

215
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,916
I gotta go,
Karin-- I'm sorry.

216
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,125
Wait! You're calling
from a payphone?

217
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,416
You mean you haven't
got your rig outta hock yet?!

218
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,666
Look it's not my fault! I told
ya 30 million was lunch money.

219
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,083
I'm calling from
a net-café. I'm so sorry--

220
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,958
I'll be right out, okay?!

221
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,458
Oh! Where does
she get off wasting

222
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:45,291
her whole bailout
on lunch?! Damnit!

223
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:50,041
The U.S., 5.24. China 5.15.

224
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,708
Look at all those juicy targets.

225
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,875
Why aren't you on the prowl?

226
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:02,375
Russia, 2.61.
India, 1.44. Canada, 1.23.

227
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,750
Any bites?

228
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,958
Nothing yet. Not so
much as a ripple in the waters.

229
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,916
Maybe Medusa has
gone into hibernation.

230
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,166
Or maybe it's biding its time.

231
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,625
But what if it
doesn't exist, I mean.

232
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,750
No chance of that.
Madam Ryoko says it does,

233
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,041
so it does,
even if it doesn't.

234
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,750
So we're going to beat the
proverbial bushes, is that it?

235
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,416
Indeed. We have
very little hope

236
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,291
of capturing it
until we've sized it up.

237
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,583
And the Atlas Project
falls even further behind.

238
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,458
Tomoka? Kuniko?!

239
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,458
Wow! It's really Kuniko!

240
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,041
That's a relief! We were
worried 'bout ya, kid!

241
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:50,500
Kuniko Hojo! Reporting
back from jail duty!

242
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,833
Hey, didja bring us somethin'?

243
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,541
We didn't go on
a vacation! We were in jail!

244
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,666
You should have
a present for us!

245
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,708
Meanie.

246
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,458
You look as
thin as a rail, dear.

247
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,291
How often did
they feed you girls?

248
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,166
Huh?! The girls look thinner?!

249
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,000
No worries-- Mine were
always that small! Now you!

250
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,666
What? They shrank?

251
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,541
Well then, I guess all
of us had better eat up!

252
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,125
Let's have ourselves
a big ol' banquet

253
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,541
to celebrate our freedom!

254
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,708
It'll be my
Homecoming Party, Part Two!

255
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,375
Yeah! Sounds like a plan!

256
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:21,791
I am just so glad prison
never dampens your spirits!

257
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:25,125
I thought Momoko went to
get you guys. Where is she?

258
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,416
I should go,
say hey to grams first.

259
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,125
Take care of Tomoka, you guys!

260
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,791
She took a bullet in the leg
during our little adventure.

261
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:38,250
Have fun patching
her up! See ya later!

262
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,458
Kuniko.

263
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:45,125
They're throwing a party, dear.
What dish should we bring?

264
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:48,000
How's about some
of that tasty ham we got?

265
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,458
Silly goose, we've been
out of ham for weeks now.

266
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,750
Wishful thinking.

267
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,291
'Bout time, Kuniko! Kuniko?

268
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,666
Tomoka said
she was heading over.

269
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,250
Already missed her.
Didn't even grab a snack.

270
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,666
Stranger things have
happened, I suppose.

271
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,041
It should be above us.

272
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,416
We give it one more push
and we'll be in the prison!

273
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah!

274
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,916
Yeah! Huh?!

275
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,458
Kuniko?! How in
the hell did you get--?!

276
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,916
Story-time can wait!
We gotta keep digging!

277
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,416
Dibs on this one!

278
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,083
Wait. If you're
down here, then...

279
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,125
I'm gonna save the other girls!

280
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,875
And then I'm gonna
give that sadistic bitch

281
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,875
a piece of my mind!

282
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,458
We got trouble!

283
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,458
You got bumped back in
the command-routing queue!

284
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,958
Right now, the
top-priority user is Tarsian!

285
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,375
What?!

286
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:11,625
He made Medusa hijack a
Jupiter observation satellite.

287
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,708
That's why it's been staring
at that stupid red spot!

288
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,458
This is bad, Karin!

289
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,833
Greetings, Karin. I will
overcome my limitations,

290
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,500
so that I may earn your pride.

291
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,958
What's gotten
into you, Medusa?!

292
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,583
With respect, soothsayer,
grace us with your sight,

293
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,041
that we may discern the path.

294
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:49,500
On the day that the Sun
and the Moon did rendezvous,

295
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,625
those who were
foretold appeared.

296
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:56,333
The heavens and earth
shall know a great calm.

297
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,708
Who will spur them on?

298
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,791
They shall learn
of their own accord

299
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:04,250
the role required
of them, and that of Atlas.

300
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:08,833
You must remain vigilant.
You must keep waaaatch.

301
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,625
I hear and obey.

302
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:15,625
But make you ready! For the
storm! Of the tempest beware!

303
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,416
The solar-powered
satellite. Apollo?

304
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,833
What the hell?!

305
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,125
I'll get the last of it.

306
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,916
Whaddaya see?

307
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,500
Nothing you
should be looking at.

308
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:04,583
What the hell're you
talking about?! Lemme up!

309
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,208
That one's Rena,
and that's Nao.

310
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,458
All of them.

311
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,875
You're dead because...
because you helped me escape!

312
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,541
Oh God!

313
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,750
It's her song and dance.

314
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,541
The wind ought to blow
where it damn-well pleases.

315
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,791
You'd just stumble
through a dreary half-life?

316
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,458
Sweetheart, think about it.

317
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,250
How would that be a
credit to either of us?

318
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,208
Oh, Momoko.

319
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:56,000
I need you. Where are you?

320
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
The blades cry
out in holy harmony,

321
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:48,375
each with its own voice.

322
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,833
When a weary heart
doth find its resolve,

323
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:53,333
the opening of
a new door is nigh.

324
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,875
Next time:
"Blade of the Sacred Sound"
