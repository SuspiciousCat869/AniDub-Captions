1
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:36,916
Haven't heard anything yet.
Hope they're doing okay.

2
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,416
Come on, you.
It's time for bed.

3
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,500
Nuh-uh.
I wanna wait for Kuniko.

4
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,875
We've got incoming
video from Nerima Ward!

5
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,750
Holy crap!

6
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:42,083
Southeast Toshima, Rokugo Bridge
in Ota. They're everywhere!

7
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,458
And Ikebukuro!

8
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,083
Ya think it's
those guys Takehiko paid?!

9
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:56,375
Is anybody there? Hellooo.

10
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,875
My bad, Momoko!

11
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,750
That's delicate equipment
designed for your mouth, hon.

12
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,125
Don't jab it with your
fingers like a barbarian.

13
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,375
Look, pervert--
I am not takin' the bait.

14
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,833
"Pervert?" Surely you jest.

15
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,958
Whatever, man-eater.
Save it for the boys.

16
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,541
As lucky panties go,
white is a bit pedestrian.

17
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,041
Then don't look!

18
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,583
Betcha we'll get there
after the whole thing's wrapped.

19
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,916
What makes you think
they'd go off half-cocked?

20
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The cock-and-a-half
who's leadin' 'em.

21
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,375
Takehiko?

22
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,916
He's a sweetie.
But so impatient.

23
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,791
Kuniko, what's your 20?

24
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,166
'bout time, 'cause I
wasn't feeling the love!

25
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,125
Where're you guys at?
Hey, ya there?

26
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,083
Team One here. Are you inside?

27
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,375
Team Three!
Damned glad to have ya!

28
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,541
No kidding!

29
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,041
That's more like it.
Now gimmie a sit-rep, pronto.

30
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,166
We're in. We broke
through in nothin' flat.

31
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,041
Team Two is almost inside.

32
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:23,208
Okay, guys.
Start laying down cover-fire.

33
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,291
This is Team Seven.
No sign of our target.

34
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:29,291
They couldn't find the
TV station? 'Kay, Plan B--

35
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,916
Join up with the team
headed to the Diet Building.

36
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,833
Hey, Nine through Fourteen,
check in. Where are you guys?

37
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,958
We're in the jungle, ma'am.

38
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,958
Wha--? Yusuke
from Team Nine, right?

39
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,291
D'you mind
saying that again?

40
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,541
Yeah, Team Nine.

41
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,958
Look, we're up to
our asses in foliage here!

42
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,083
"Foliage" some kinda code word?

43
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,583
Man-scaping issue?

44
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,583
This is Team Twelve!
Everything's gone FUBAR!

45
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,375
There's a huge
wall of fire and--!

46
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,125
Holy shit! Is that
the old steam train?!

47
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,708
Team Ten's gotta pull back!

48
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,625
This bridge is
gonna collapse any second!

49
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,916
No more crazy-talk!
Keep it together! Takehiko!

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What the hell's
going on out there?!

51
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,625
You really wanna know?

52
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,875
C'mon-- Don't make
a girl beg for it.

53
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,458
Don't tease him, Momoko!

54
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,541
Just tell me
your location, okay?

55
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:16,125
We're on a goddamn island.

56
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,583
On an island?!

57
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,958
Crazy, huh? Got ocean
as far as the eye can see.

58
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,166
Son of a--!

59
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,000
Takehiko, What's going on?!

60
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,291
Kuniko! What do we--?!

61
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,458
Oh! Shit! We're surrounded!

62
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,208
They're tearin' us up--!

63
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,250
Man down!

64
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,458
An update, Madam.
Reon's leading ground troops

65
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,333
to engage the
guerillas on Level Eight.

66
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,541
How much damage
can we anticipate?

67
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,958
A mere three
percent of the structure.

68
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,583
Begin the repairs.
And track down any traitors.

69
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:55,958
Yes, ma'am.

70
00:05:56,041 --> 00:06:00,416
Do find me, dear. I have
a lovely surprise for you.

71
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,000
Hey, Yusuke. I think we're goin'
around in circles, here man.

72
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,166
No shit. It's because all
these trees look the same!

73
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,625
Five targets sighted.
One o'clock.

74
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,833
Proceed with caution.

75
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,125
They're clueless, sir.

76
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:15,250
It's gonna be like
shooting fish in a barrel.

77
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,916
We're ordered to fire
on our own countrymen?

78
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,125
Sir! They've compromised
the shaft's entryway!

79
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,416
You're tenacious, Digma Two.

80
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,750
This is Level Eight, right?

81
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:44,083
I figured they'd have a tanning
salon, but this is ridiculous!

82
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,458
You gotta be kidding me!

83
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,708
Heads up! It's mimetic armor!

84
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,375
You cut out--
Something 'bout a medic?

85
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,000
Say again?

86
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,916
All o' that crazy
crap you're looking at?!

87
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,208
It ain't real!
What do we do now?

88
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,208
Better use your
mind's eye, girlie.

89
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,166
Cause looks can be misleading.

90
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,333
I don't see anything.

91
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,750
'Course you don't! The threat's
invisible to the naked eye.

92
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,166
Like your ta-tas!

93
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:18,000
They'll kick in sooner or later.

94
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,041
Huh?

95
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,458
Wait a sec!

96
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,833
This is Tokyo!

97
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,541
Yeah, before the big earthquake.
Too prim for my blood.

98
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,833
Got y'ears on, kid?

99
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,000
We're in pre-quake Tokyo. So...

100
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,666
Where's that leave Atlas?

101
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,208
Calm your ass down.
We're stuck in the same mirage.

102
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,916
Even found the Diet Building.

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,916
Really?!

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,916
Bad news is,
ammo's runnin' out.

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,333
The guys're burnin' through
it pretty friggin' quick.

106
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,833
Just try to hold your ground.

107
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,958
That's a good spot
for us all to regroup.

108
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,458
Time to go!

109
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,833
Oh man! What is
that awesome thing?!

110
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,875
Up til now? A guy in a suit!

111
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,416
Old Tokyo was
the coolest place ever!

112
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,333
Let's rendezvous
at the Diet Buiding!

113
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,750
Takehiko. Any luck reachin' her?

114
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,458
Yeah. How 'bout you guys?

115
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,833
Naw, no dice.
Nothin' but static.

116
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,916
So what'd she say?

117
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,125
She wants all the teams
to meet up at Tokyo City Hall.

118
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:26,083
Got it! Listen up, guys!
We're goin' to City Hall!

119
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,625
Tokyo City Hall.
That's what she said.

120
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:37,916
Rank simpletons. Like bugs,
whirling around a bright light.

121
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,583
Yes. Those rebels could never
defeat our soldiers, madam.

122
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,916
You misunderstand me, Shion.

123
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,291
They've no idea, you see.

124
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,958
The glow which
dazzles them is in truth

125
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,333
a fire that will
burn them all alive.

126
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,541
Madam Ryoko.?

127
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,541
Atlas was built with
but one purpose in mind.

128
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,625
Do you know what that is?

129
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,375
Damned if I know.
Gimmie a hint.

130
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:07,583
You're no fun.
Okay, fine. Ikebukuro.

131
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,208
I'm used to it being overgrown.
You know what I mean?

132
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,083
When something you've
always taken for granted

133
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,500
is suddenly gone, it has a way
of messing with your head-space.

134
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,333
And when something
new takes the stage,

135
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,958
like an awe-inspiring rack,
say, you'd better believe

136
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,916
there are gonna be people who'll
simply refuse to accept it.

137
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,500
So back when it
first got unveiled,

138
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:33,458
did a lotta people think that
about the plan to build Atlas?

139
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,500
You're flat and
I'm old. Touché.

140
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:41,041
I think that most people
were in favor of the idea.

141
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,791
Central Japan was ravaged
by a natural disaster--

142
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,625
The Second Great
Kanto Earthquake.

143
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:51,250
The resulting fires
consumed all of Tokyo.

144
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,791
It was every man for himself.

145
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,291
Damages were in the trillions.

146
00:09:56,375 --> 00:10:00,250
Over ten million Japanese
were dead or missing.

147
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:04,916
People lost their homes, their
families. They had nothing.

148
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,166
What's worse, the
government was in no shape

149
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,833
to be doling out aid.

150
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,416
How come?

151
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,833
The Monetized Carbon System had
just become the global standard.

152
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:17,208
We were drowning in taxes.
Going down for the count.

153
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,041
That's why the
suits left 'em hangin'?!

154
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:22,125
'Cause it was too
expensive?! What the hell!

155
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,708
Luckily, the private sector
was there to pick up the slack.

156
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,500
That's where Atlas comes in?
But who had that kinda scratch?

157
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,416
Billions and
billions in "scratch",

158
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,166
and one man donated all of it.

159
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,083
Atlas's co-founder and
consigliere, Sergei Tarsian.

160
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:41,291
It's his support that brought
the dream of Atlas to life.

161
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,333
"Take this broken
land before you

162
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,708
and fashion something
strong," he said.

163
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,500
That sounds like
the old man, all right.

164
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,000
"Fashion something strong?"

165
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,458
In other words, "This
sandcastle's played out,

166
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:57,958
and high-tide's a-comin'.
Let's go back to square one."

167
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,125
Tokyo was abandoned
to nature in the hopes

168
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,916
it would help
cool down the planet,

169
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,666
and reborn as Atlas,
a high-tech aerie.

170
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,833
A habitat regulated
entirely by computers.

171
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,750
An edifice that
would laugh in the face

172
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,708
of typhoon and
earthquake alike.

173
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,916
A bright, shining land of
milk and honey rose above them.

174
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,583
All they had to do was wait
for construction to wrap up.

175
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,500
The Atlas Plan
rescued our country from

176
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,250
a grim future filled
with uncertainty.

177
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,541
It's been Japan's salvation

178
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,250
and a beacon to
others around the world.

179
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,083
Go on.

180
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,416
And now that you are
spearheading the Atlas project,

181
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,750
Madam Ryoko, our future
is brighter than ever before--

182
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,708
It's an honor to serve--

183
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,000
Atlas exists for one reason.

184
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:47,250
To be my source of amusement!

185
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,166
If you can't bear that much
in mind, perhaps I ought to

186
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,583
shunt you back to the jungle.
You and your brother both.

187
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,125
Please forgive my stupidity!
I beg of you!

188
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,750
Mister Tarsian awaits you.

189
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,250
Obviously.

190
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,833
There are so many,
it's hard to pick just one!

191
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:12,916
Indeed. But Brazil's carbon
index is the most vulnerable.

192
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,416
May I initiate a head-lease?

193
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,708
They burn down jungle to farm.

194
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,625
That's why they're in trouble.

195
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,625
You are one smart cookie.

196
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:25,041
Karin. We should consider
putting blinders on Medusa.

197
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,666
It's growing too aware.

198
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,250
What's wrong, Zhang?

199
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,083
That can't be fear that I'm
hearing in your voice, can it?

200
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,250
I'm not afraid! I'm just
pointing out that our program

201
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,750
is growing more sophisticated.

202
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,458
It's acting
independent of our commands,

203
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:40,208
and has demonstrated the desire
and ability to defend itself.

204
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,291
Besides, we're all so rich now,

205
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,333
we don't need the
profit at a time like this!

206
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,708
"But this is the
perfect time for it."

207
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,541
Thanks a bunch for
the chaotic market, Tokyo!

208
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,958
Don't be glib, you two--
This is serious!

209
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,166
Pardon the intrusion.

210
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,125
That's a nice dress.

211
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,208
"O Sun. Illuminate the
heavens and the earth alike."

212
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:18,666
"O Moon. Climb the sky. Dispel
the o'er arcing darkness."

213
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,250
"O Land, enthrall
the day and the night,

214
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,458
and hold thee
sway upon the world."

215
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,333
We have the triad.

216
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,416
The completion of
Atlas is all that remains.

217
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,416
Half a century is
but the blink of an eye.

218
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,500
How could people have
built all this so quickly?

219
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,625
Your donation made it possible.

220
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:46,166
She had a dream, and I wrote
a check. Don't canonize me.

221
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,583
Where the hell am I?

222
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,583
My Lady Mikuni
is the rightful heir.

223
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,166
There she goes.

224
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,958
I will know the true nature of
this place, from Hiruko himself!

225
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,708
What are your orders, Madam?

226
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,500
Let her scurry away.

227
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,416
Capture her at once.

228
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,125
She won't make it to the top.

229
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:51,166
It's nothing to
interrupt our chess game over.

230
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,833
Clearly it is. Soichiro.

231
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,458
Ma'am.

232
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,791
This tower will be
defunct if any misfortune

233
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:08,750
should befall Lord Hiruko.
You are well aware of that.

234
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,750
Yes. Very.

235
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:15,166
All you have to do is
put my commands into action.

236
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,833
I understand my role.

237
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,041
Is there anyone
out there?! My team's KIA!

238
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,041
Please tell me I'm
not the only one left!

239
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,375
You're breaking up.

240
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,458
Yusuke?

241
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,041
Oh, thank God!

242
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,500
Tell me what you're lookin' at.

243
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,500
I'm lookin' at...

244
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,208
Shinjuku? What the hell?

245
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,416
Head to the station.

246
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,375
Kuniko's nearby, isn't she?

247
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:49,291
And the others, I mean,
they're all right, yeah?

248
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,708
All this was just a trap?!

249
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,791
Motherfucker.

250
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,541
Yusuke! D'you read?!

251
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,750
We gotta go!

252
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,791
C'mon! Time to beat feet!

253
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,125
No. No more running!

254
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,666
Girl, what are
you talking about?

255
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,541
I'm sick of this crap!

256
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,750
Get the hell outta my waaaay!

257
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,958
There's more
where that came from!

258
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:40,625
Lieutenant!

259
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,166
Wait, Tokyo Station?!

260
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,416
How did we overshoot
the Diet Building?

261
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,625
You were in
boomerang-bitch mode.

262
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:02,083
Kuniko! Where'd you
scamper off to this time?!

263
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,666
Kunihito!

264
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,208
Been back to
Akihabara, sticky-fingers?

265
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,500
You tell your leader,

266
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,750
people are gonna die
if he doesn't surrender!

267
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,583
Actually, I'm the one
who's calling the shots now.

268
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,000
You're kidding me!

269
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,291
'Fraid not!

270
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,875
I didn't know that.

271
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,625
Then you need to order
your people to stand down!

272
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,375
You assholes are the
ones who need to stand down!

273
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,958
You're all hiding
behind holograms anyway!

274
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,833
We're trying to
defend the capital!

275
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,500
What about the
people left outside?!

276
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:41,125
Duomo's hanging on by a thread.
Why don't you care about us?!

277
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,500
How can someone who pulls a gun

278
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,291
on their own countrymen
call himself a soldier?

279
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,375
I know something's
definitely wrong here.

280
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,625
I've known for a while.

281
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:51,958
Then, why're you--?!

282
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,708
'Cause attacking us
doesn't change a damn thing!

283
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,333
All it does is
get people killed!

284
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,000
So what then? Run back home?

285
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,500
Nature's taking it.
There is no going back.

286
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,250
You have a home here.

287
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,541
Your family lives
in Atlas, don't you?

288
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,958
Yeah we do. And if I die
protecting 'em, then so be it.

289
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:15,500
Yeah, well. I'm trying
to save my people!

290
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:26,875
Hold it!

291
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,375
Easy, Lieutenant.

292
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,541
Corporate is taking
over jurisdiction on this.

293
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:37,541
The end-game. When a
pawn can topple a king.

294
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,083
If the queen doesn't slay them.

295
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:46,125
Momoko. I just
wanna be wherever you are!

296
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,541
Damn robot!

297
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,041
There it is!

298
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,583
Mate in one.

299
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,000
My team is in trouble here!

300
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,250
It looks like
Atlas is starting to

301
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,541
use some kinda
chemical weapons on us!

302
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,666
What'n the blue hell?!

303
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,541
Now they gas us?!

304
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,166
Centralizing all city
functions in this way

305
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,750
will conserve energy.

306
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,916
Our designs feature
disaster-resistant

307
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,958
carbon polymers that are
virtually indestructible.

308
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:18,916
Welcome to my Atlas,
city born of a dream.

309
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,500
All systems herein
will be controlled by Zeus,

310
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:25,375
a cutting-edge AI.
Our majordomo, as it were.

311
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,208
As the world's fastest computer,

312
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,083
Zeus will
supervise construction

313
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,875
and maintain
public safety with ease.

314
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:35,291
Our world is speeding
towards a carbon-based economy.

315
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,541
With this in mind,

316
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,041
our company is putting
its faith in graphite,

317
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:42,666
both as an investment
and a building material.

318
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,791
Standing at my side is New York
financier Sergei Tarsian.

319
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,250
He's contributed
50 billion dollars to

320
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,500
the construction
of the Atlas habitat.

321
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,833
Our future demands
no less an investment.

322
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,583
To the chosen
children for whom we've

323
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,541
undertaken this grand labor,

324
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,125
I hope you appear
within our lifetime.

325
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,625
Listen well to Zeus,
and do not fear your destiny.

326
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:08,666
A new world awaits you.
Come forth and claim it.

327
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:13,000
Whatever you may
discover on your mission,

328
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:16,000
you must face it
without trepidation.

329
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,375
Your birth mother
lives in Atlas, after all.

330
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:21,750
Hash out your
feelings. Give it time.

331
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:26,333
Life will make you choose
a path. I'm sure of it.

332
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:30,125
Kuniko! There's no
question of your courage.

333
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:33,083
But you'll have to
draw on every screed of it.

334
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,250
Why didn't you tell me?

335
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,125
Why did you lie?!

336
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:31,083
Lady Mikuni,
I am... here.

337
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,875
I just want to keep 'em safe.

338
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:51,208
My family. Atlas. All the
people who call it home.

339
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:54,875
I know the system
isn't perfect, but still.

340
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,791
Next time: "Freak Defeat"
