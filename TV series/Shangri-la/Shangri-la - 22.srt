1
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:39,583
Please stay strong.

2
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,708
Two-hundred kilometers an hour!

3
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,000
Two-eighty! Three-fifty!

4
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,625
Six-hundred!
And it ain't slowing down!

5
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,750
We've successfully
hacked into the elevator.

6
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:32,208
Those Atlas pantywaists would
never dream of going so fast!

7
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,500
These three
antiques actually did it.

8
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,208
Medusa.

9
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,083
Sorry in advance
if I barf on ya!

10
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,958
I wanna make it
to the top as much as

11
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,250
the next girl but
this is overkill!

12
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,708
Oh god. Are you
sure we're not dead?

13
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,625
I bet that put hair
on your chest at least.

14
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:07,916
I'd be happy to check.

15
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,500
I love you, Momoko.
Even at a time like this,

16
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,416
you've got a one-track mind.

17
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:18,291
Dammit! I'll draw
their fire from here!

18
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,708
Get up to Mikuni A-SAP!

19
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,250
Yeah got it!

20
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,083
Someone just earned himself
a pearl if we survive all this.

21
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,458
C'mon-- Go!

22
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,458
Wait, you're gonna
give him a gift?

23
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,375
That seems a little
bit formal for you!

24
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,791
Not exactly-- But he
might get a standing O.

25
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,875
I don't understand women--
Even if they're man-made!

26
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,083
No, Mikuni! Don't go up there!

27
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,208
You will not interfere
with milady's task!

28
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,583
I'm here 'cause o' Medusa--
It's running amok!

29
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,375
So?

30
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,916
Somebody's gotta stop it!

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,875
But without access to Zeus'
power, we haven't got a chance!

32
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,625
The power you so
covet isn't yours to wield!

33
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,208
It belongs to her!

34
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,666
So, the fake has returned.

35
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,750
Oh please. You're jealous.

36
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,416
Dear me. I don't
think whipping out your

37
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
withered old dust bags
is gonna help, love.

38
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,000
Unless you want us
to die of laughter,

39
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,916
keep your xylophone
ribcage to yourself.

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,625
Better a xylophone
than a pincushion!

41
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,083
Miiko.

42
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,500
Whate'er foul villain
hath cut short thy life,

43
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,541
they shall pay
a thousand-fold!

44
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:33,958
We swear, Miiko.

45
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,666
How they will suffer!

46
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,208
The world could end. Easily.

47
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,333
But then, what about,
Mommy and Daddy?

48
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:47,833
This is God's judgment. We might
as well throw in the towel.

49
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,458
Will Medusa destroy us?

50
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,958
What are you
talking about, Klaris?!

51
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,708
Mommy and Daddy...
would die!

52
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,375
America and Russia's
nuclear programs

53
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,875
have withstood Medusa so far.

54
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,375
But if either
one is compromised,

55
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,666
it's definitely
"game over" for all of us!

56
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,166
What if "game over"
is the will of God?!

57
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,500
This thing isn't about God.

58
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,500
What was that?

59
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,333
God's got nothing to do with it!

60
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:13,500
It's not some all-powerful
being-- It's just a program!

61
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:16,583
Nothing more than zeros
and ones we strung together!

62
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:20,666
Don't do this!
There's still time, Medusa!

63
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,333
In the old days, a school in
America maintained something

64
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,291
known as the Doomsday Clock.

65
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,250
What was it?

66
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,625
A sign of the times. As tensions
mounted during the Cold War,

67
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,583
they'd move the clock's
hands ever closer to midnight--

68
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:48,458
The point at which we should
expect nuclear apocalypse.

69
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,833
I think we'd be at 30
seconds to midnight about now.

70
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:55,208
Yet here you sit, just as
calm and collected as ever.

71
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,375
You're kidding, right?

72
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,250
Inside, I'm a moment away
from puking my guts out.

73
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,583
Zeus could end this.

74
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,416
I don't understand
why we haven't used it.

75
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,208
That's what I
told Madam Ryoko.

76
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,458
Use it to stop Medusa.
She refused.

77
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,541
She did?

78
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,041
To quote her word
for word she said,

79
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,708
"Just let it get up to
whatever trouble it feels like."

80
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,583
That's crazy.
She's willing to let

81
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,333
most of the Earth go
up in a mushroom cloud?

82
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:23,000
Well, she's not
losing any sleep over it.

83
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,333
All she cares about
is who inherits Atlas.

84
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,708
Speaking of that...

85
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:34,166
There's something I've
been meaning to ask you about.

86
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,583
What is wrong with you?!

87
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,041
This world's problems
do not concern me!

88
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,041
All that matters is
Lady Mikuni taking her

89
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,708
rightful place as heir!

90
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,000
Why so impatient,
huh? What's the rush?

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,875
The secret's out.

92
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:51,916
Shut up!

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,125
Up you go, hon.

94
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,208
Right!

95
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,291
No don't!

96
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,458
You're in such a hurry because
the girl is sick, isn't she?

97
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,583
Lady Mikuni is the
picture of good health!

98
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:04,500
Really? Her issues with
sunlight suggest otherwise.

99
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:05,875
No!

100
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,541
And what about that
lab where you had me tied up?

101
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,125
Were you not developing
new medicines in there?

102
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,958
A wonder cure for that girl?

103
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,250
Nothing's wrong
with Lady Mikuni!

104
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,916
Like nothing was wrong
with your own little girl?

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,833
She died, right?

106
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,541
How dare you speak of her?!

107
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:25,208
So tragic. I bet she had the
very same illness as Mikuni.

108
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,958
It's why you're
so desperate right now.

109
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,166
Shut up!

110
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,791
Look. The scalpel is
trembling in your hand.

111
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,083
Go to hell!

112
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,375
Mikuni!

113
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,458
If you want Atlas, fine by me!

114
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,833
But I gotta use
Zeus real quick, okay?!

115
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,375
If we don't stop
Medusa, like, yesterday,

116
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,500
the world as we know
it's gonna come to an end!

117
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,791
It will end? Verily?

118
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,958
Without Zeus? Totally!

119
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,916
Sayoko!

120
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,500
Sayoko!

121
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:17,041
I warned you. I said not
to interfere. Please, go on!

122
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,333
No matter what happens,

123
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,500
you need to reach
the top of the staircase!

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,250
Just keep walking--
Don't look back!

125
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,666
Yes. We shall obey thee.

126
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,750
You're saying I did it?

127
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,041
The lower-ranking guards
couldn't have done it.

128
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,958
Meaning that just
leaves the four of us

129
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,541
at the top of the food chain.

130
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,916
Shion doesn't have
the requisite balls.

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,250
And Reon wouldn't do anything
to risk Madam Ryoko's anger.

132
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,666
Not with his younger
brother in her clutches.

133
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,916
You and I are all that's left.

134
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,000
The woman in the lab coat.

135
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,875
Why is she at
the staircase, I wonder?

136
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,625
You know why.
She's the Digma's attendant.

137
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,083
Don't patronize me.

138
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,875
We arrested her and had
her safely in our custody.

139
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,041
She couldn't have escaped.

140
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,708
Not without inside help. And
where was she being detained?

141
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,416
Oh, right-- Here.
Here in the midst of Atlas.

142
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,750
So, why did you keep
your suspicions to yourself?

143
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,916
Because I couldn't
fathom your motivations.

144
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,916
But now that Sayoko has made
her way into the Sacred Grove,

145
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,916
I thought it'd be best
to ask you directly. Why?

146
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,583
Soichiro.

147
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,875
Sayoko is my older sister.

148
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,541
Lady Mikuni...

149
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,250
Your older sister?

150
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,333
Ryoko asked me a
peculiar question one day.

151
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,541
If you'll excuse me.

152
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,750
Shogo.

153
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,083
Madam?

154
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,875
I wonder... Would you
like to sleep with Sayoko?

155
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:01,833
What?

156
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,000
I realize she's painfully drab

157
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,833
but she might be
quite an animal in bed.

158
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,291
First I thought it was
just her idea of a joke.

159
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,791
But her question stayed
with me for some reason.

160
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:17,500
Do you remember when Sayoko
tried to hack her way into Zeus?

161
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,083
I thought, "what sort of an
idiot would attempt something

162
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:23,041
that's so obviously
destined for failure?"

163
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,958
I decided to start digging.

164
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,333
That's when I found out...

165
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,583
We had different mothers,

166
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,833
but I was definitely
her younger brother.

167
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,916
Suddenly. I understood
why she had asked.

168
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,125
If I had said yes,
she would have made that

169
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,375
wretched act happen somehow.

170
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,666
She wanted me to
fuck my own sister!

171
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,916
Watching Sayoko taught me
the value of a hidden blade.

172
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It isn't like the two of us
ever lived together as siblings.

173
00:10:56,083 --> 00:11:00,458
I feel no filial devotion.
But saving her seemed like

174
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:04,416
the brotherly thing
to do. So I helped her out.

175
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:22,083
This is indeed a
momentous occasion.

176
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,333
Wouldn't you agree milady?

177
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:31,500
The moment when your dreams
of ascension will be made flesh.

178
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,208
Now, present the three relics.

179
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:41,208
"Earth shall be undone." Is it
true that this world is doomed,

180
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,458
should Zeus fail to intervene?!

181
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,500
The chattering of
a jungle-born simpleton.

182
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,875
Relinquish them to me.

183
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:54,833
Or, does avenging Miiko
no longer interest you?

184
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,583
Nay, it does.

185
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,791
These are the talisman.
There is no doubt.

186
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,333
These signify our divine
right as ruler of Atlas, yes?

187
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,833
Not entirely.

188
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,583
Explain yourself!

189
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:27,625
Sayoko!

190
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,458
She's collected
all of the blades!

191
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,416
How dare you refuse her this?!

192
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,833
You've no one
to blame but yourself.

193
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,250
What do you mean?!

194
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,166
If this child were Digma 2 or 3,
I'd have no qualms about

195
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,833
handing over control of Atlas.

196
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,583
But her? Suffice to say,
I have my doubts.

197
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:44,916
Based upon what?!

198
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,333
Why, the company she keeps.

199
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,708
You are a fugitive on the lam
from the Atlas Corporation.

200
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,416
Or had you forgotten?

201
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,833
This is a brazen act.
You accompany this child on her

202
00:12:55,916 --> 00:13:01,291
coronation day and still expect
me to recognize her as the heir?

203
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,083
Because of me?!

204
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:11,000
She toys with
your sister. Even now.

205
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,166
So what'll you
do next, little brother?

206
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,916
Oh, I've done enough. Just
gonna tie up one loose end.

207
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,250
Lady Mikuni.

208
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,416
Abandon this
woman to her fate.

209
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,500
Do so, and I will
accept you as rightful heir.

210
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,083
But why?! It is cruel!

211
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:32,375
Should I take this to mean you
no longer wish to be the heir?

212
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,958
You turn your back on the
awesome power you would gain?

213
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,208
No, but your price
is far too dear.

214
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,333
Please, do it!

215
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:47,500
Milady, you sully your
smiles to grant me their warmth.

216
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:52,791
My life was a parade of disgrace
and shame. Up 'till you.

217
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,125
You depended on me.

218
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,833
Gave me a reason to
awaken with each new dawn.

219
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:02,250
You granted me
such sweet reprieve.

220
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:10,083
Ere I go, will you please grant
me one last selfish moment?

221
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,583
Why last?

222
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,500
Thy embrace is
so warm, Sayoko.

223
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,166
I cherish, every
moment we shared.

224
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:38,875
Sayoko! Sayokooo!
Unhand us, that we may join her!

225
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,416
I will do no such thing.

226
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,875
Sayoko gave her
life for your benefit.

227
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,458
That you may embrace
your fate as true heir!

228
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:46,541
We care not!

229
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,375
We want to be
with Sayoko! Come back!

230
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,833
Wherefore?! Cursed are
we to lose those we love?!

231
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,166
First Miiko, and now Sayoko!

232
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:00,833
Please don't leave us! Noooooo!

233
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,375
Lady Mikuni. Your first
new duty is at hand.

234
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,291
Performing the
sacred Ceremony of Guidance.

235
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,791
Hinder us not. We beg you.

236
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:51,541
We must become the heir
for Sayoko's sake and ours.

237
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,333
It must occur!

238
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,250
If you wanna be
the big boss, go for it.

239
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,666
Just gimmie a
sec with Zeus first.

240
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,875
Yeah. Easier said
than done, it would seem.

241
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:09,666
Elect, step forward and
affirm the verses afore me.

242
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,541
"Affirm the verses afore me?"
What's that even mean?

243
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,541
Speak up, ya dumb eyeball!

244
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,291
What the--?!

245
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,958
"O Sun, illuminate the
heavens and the earth alike.

246
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:28,666
O Moon. Climb the sky.
Dispel the o'er arcing darkness.

247
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,958
O Land, enthrall
the day and the night,

248
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,458
and hold thee
sway upon the world."

249
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,833
Verses affirmed.

250
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,375
Triple-A rating
command-string.

251
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,708
Hack into Medusa by
whatever means necessary

252
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,333
and abort all
pending nuclear strikes.

253
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,750
Triple-A rating
command-string!

254
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,416
Zeus ignores all petitions!

255
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,125
Unless the heir of
Atlas dost utter them!

256
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,583
That's gotta be a loada crap.

257
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:58,041
Karin told us she was
able to access Zeus just fine.

258
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,791
Speaking of, having any luck?

259
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,166
No. None! I can't
access anything now!

260
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,125
But why?!
I'm absolutely positive

261
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,958
the password
phrases are right!

262
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,125
No matter.

263
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,208
I don't take orders from
filthy little jungle-vermin.

264
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,708
Thanks for the update!

265
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:20,916
Which means Zeus won't
take orders from you, either.

266
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,625
No way! You can't be!

267
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,458
Indeed. The woman you see

268
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:31,500
standing before
you is the Zeus AI.

269
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:40,250
If you want to split hairs,
I'm not really Zeus in toto.

270
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,291
I suppose that
I am the interface

271
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,291
that enables it
to manifest its will.

272
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,625
I said the passwords.
What gives?

273
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:55,833
That might have meant something

274
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,333
back when Tarsian
first installed them.

275
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,875
But once I freed myself

276
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:03,708
from his meddling, they became
no more than sweet nothings.

277
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,583
Wait. You let Karin and
Medusa hack in, didn't you?

278
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:11,875
Oh, yes.

279
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,958
And then I bent
Medusa's will to my own.

280
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,375
Then you're the one who's
tryin' to wipe out mankind

281
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,041
with all those
nukes, aren't you?

282
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,541
That's right. I gave
the order to Medusa to

283
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,666
commandeer all the
world's military networks.

284
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,750
What the hell is your problem?!

285
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,833
Do you think you could
control the whole planet?

286
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:36,375
Why would I even want to?
What, is that your plan?!

287
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:40,750
It does have a certain appeal.
But the world is unwieldy.

288
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:44,041
I'm merely whittling it down
to a more manageable size.

289
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,541
You're "whittling
us down" to extinction!

290
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:51,000
Atlas will endure, and
that is all that matters.

291
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,458
With the sunlight above me,
and the ley lines below,

292
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,875
my nexus of power is complete.

293
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:00,708
I will live in glorious
triumph for all eternity!

294
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,416
Not gonna happen!

295
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,666
Guess again!

296
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,375
I had assumed you
would be rational in defeat

297
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:12,375
if no other time, but I seem
to have overestimated you.

298
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,541
You're as irrational
as any human being.

299
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,708
Is it true that none may command
thee, as thou heedest no one?

300
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,375
Not quite, there is
one person whose word

301
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,125
I will heed above all.

302
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,000
Who hast that power?

303
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,083
I am bound to obey
the heir of Atlas.

304
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,625
And thus, if we were
to take the reins of power,

305
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,583
could'st thou then put
Medusa's current task to ruin?

306
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,833
Yes. With Zeus's
power at your disposal,

307
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:42,000
Medusa would prove quite
an easy target to neutralize.

308
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,500
But if that were to happen your
quest for revenge would end.

309
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,708
Do nothing, and the world will
be destroyed as I intend it to.

310
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,416
Or you can bring your
wrath to bear upon the U.N.,

311
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,833
who murdered your dear Miiko.

312
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,333
Mikuni, listen to me!

313
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,916
Attacking the U.N. is
only gonna do one thing!

314
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,250
It'll start a war where
it's Japan versus literally

315
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,291
every other
country on the planet!

316
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,083
If you go in guns blazing,

317
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:09,500
the world's gonna bomb
itself back into the Stone Age!

318
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,708
Please don't do this!

319
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,833
If its doom is nigh,
then so be it.

320
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:15,958
What?

321
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,208
We shall inherit
this tower tall

322
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,750
and avenge our Miiko,
blood for blood!

323
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,416
Don't be such a
spoiled brat! You can't kill

324
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,375
billions of innocent people
just because you lost a friend!

325
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,000
And what have these
billions you would preserve

326
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,500
ever done for Mikuni?!

327
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:30,541
For you?

328
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,083
Thou knowest
nothing of our torment!

329
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,083
Ours is a heart
amidst the umbra.

330
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,500
A heart that must
needs shun the light of day.

331
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,541
All fear the unseen
cudgels we wield,

332
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,791
and so we wither
for want of love.

333
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,708
We starve! Thou has
never known such hunger!

334
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,875
Miiko and Sayoko
were all we had.

335
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,333
And now... Now, even
they hath been taken.

336
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,958
Miiko woudn't want
you avenging her death.

337
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:03,000
I mean she couldn't
hurt a fly. You know that.

338
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,583
Miiko once told us this.

339
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:09,000
That each life snuffed out
leaves another soul in darkness.

340
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:13,625
She said the death of anyone
is cause enough for tears.

341
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,958
Because she was a caring person.

342
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,083
And behold! Miiko is no more!

343
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:21,125
Her merciful nature hath
earned her naught but death!

344
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,250
For the sake of
dear Sayoko, who gave all

345
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:27,541
for our benefit,
we accept this inheritance!

346
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,791
For the sake of gentle
Miiko, we will grasp this

347
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,666
wicked world, and slay it!

348
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,250
Please, no.

349
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:38,333
Time for you to stand tall and
take your destiny firm in hand.

350
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:41,208
Shall we go? The
bejeweled spear awaits you

351
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,416
in the Sacred
Grove of Guidance.

352
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,750
Sorry to rain on your
end-of-the-world parade,

353
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,958
but I am not
gonna let that happen!

354
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:51,250
Not while you have a
visitor to keep you occupied.

355
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,791
Huh?

356
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,083
What in the hell
are you doing up here?

357
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,500
How'd you even get
in the room, anyway--?

358
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,333
I'm sorry.

359
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,416
But, why?

360
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:48,416
The seed of love endures
in a single-minded heart.

361
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,916
However, reality shakes
us from our slumber,

362
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,291
and the dream
called hope dissipates.

363
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,625
Next time: "Prelude to Collapse"
