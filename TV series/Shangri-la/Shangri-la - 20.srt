1
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,208
It's getting much worse.

2
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,541
Granted, it's been only two
weeks since the eradication

3
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:29,666
of the Daedalus, but the index
shouldn't continue to drop!

4
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,666
No, Medusa's to blame.

5
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,916
It's like it's feasting on
the world's financial resources.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,625
And I'm afraid
Japan's first on the menu.

7
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,375
We're heading straight
for World War Three.

8
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:43,375
Prime Minister.
What is your plan?

9
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,833
We've received a report
that a detachment of bombers

10
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:49,041
is making its way toward
the Marshall Islands.

11
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,000
It seems that the
U.N. is taking charge

12
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:54,250
of this Medusa debacle.
We should let them lead the way.

13
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:57,291
This is the result
of your incompetence!

14
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,791
How will you solve this mess?

15
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,416
Our nation's decline
since you've been

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,916
in office is unprecedented!

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,166
We cannot afford
to let this go on!

18
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,833
Do the honorable
thing and resign, at once!

19
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:09,708
Tell me. Who among
you possesses the courage

20
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:12,708
or ability to take the
helm of this sinking nation?

21
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:19,208
You cry foul and
point your fingers at me,

22
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:22,250
but still you sit,
trembling in your chairs.

23
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,291
They've been wiped out!

24
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,000
The entire U.N. bombing
detachment has been annihilated.

25
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:31,333
But how?!

26
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,458
It's just like last time.
They were destroyed by

27
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:37,000
a massive typhoon centered
over the Marshall Islands.

28
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:39,833
The report says
Medusa's to blame.

29
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:14,750
Stop!

30
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,000
I got you good!

31
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,791
Cut it out! There are
a lot of people who want

32
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:21,083
to use the tub tonight. So stop
wasting all the hot water!

33
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,458
O-kay!

34
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,750
You little brats!

35
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,958
This reminds me
of our newlywed days,

36
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,208
before we had
a tub of our own.

37
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,458
I always wanted to look
sharp for my little cutie.

38
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,708
That's so good, oh man!

39
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:44,958
What the hell are we doin'?!

40
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,416
We should be
stormin' Atlas right now!

41
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,125
We're still Metal Age, right?!

42
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,125
Yeah, but we're already
on the inside, man.

43
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,666
We don't need to storm it.

44
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,875
Listen brother, the
fight's over, so just relax

45
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,416
and get some
food in your belly.

46
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,166
Come and take a seat.
Get some grub!

47
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,666
I'm not hungry!

48
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,666
You know what they say, "an
army marches on its stomach."

49
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,166
We heard that rumble.

50
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,291
You don't want it to get cold.

51
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,500
Not too shabby.

52
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,833
Miss Haruko. I'm pretty sure
everyone got a bowl at least.

53
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,583
Man, I'm totally beat.

54
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,458
Are you sure about that?

55
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,250
How 'bout you?

56
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:33,000
Aww, thanks. Really, thanks for
everything you've done for us.

57
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,083
The way I look at it,
no matter how we got here,

58
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,791
we're all in this
together. It's just part of

59
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,666
being a good neighbor. Right?

60
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,500
Right.

61
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,916
Hey pal, no cutting in line!

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,083
Oh, sorry 'bout that! She here?

63
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,333
"She" who?

64
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,666
Who ya lookin' for?

65
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,166
There you are! Did you
order everyone to help out

66
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,416
just so you could
run around all afternoon?

67
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,708
Hey! Don't run off
while I'm talking to you!

68
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,708
Is Kuniko playin' hard to get?

69
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,250
Sounds like her.

70
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,250
Tropical Fish's
stiffest competition.

71
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,875
Welcome to paradise, boys!
I hope you'll stay a while!

72
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,708
Get ready to pop that cork!

73
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,541
Momoko, you're
wanted at table three!

74
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,541
Move those buns, hon!

75
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,708
I've come home.

76
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,166
Tokyo's a big
place, isn't it?!

77
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,958
How invigorating to get
out of that stuffy old tower!

78
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:01,333
But the air here is a bit
overcooked at the moment.

79
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,041
What's wrong?

80
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:06,583
If we wanted to get
rid of it all, we did it.

81
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,791
Wanna take it back?

82
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,041
Too late.

83
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,458
You did what no
one else could, love.

84
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:20,916
Can I finish the job? Can I
make a new world from this?

85
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,750
Listen up!
I'm done mopin' around!

86
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,291
Gotta keep movin' forward!

87
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,666
I've been lookin'
all over for ya!

88
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,500
Why, did something happen?

89
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,875
Well, kinda.
Come with me for a bit.

90
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,375
Just tell me.

91
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:43,583
I can't put it into words.
Just come on already, would ya?!

92
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,083
Nuh uh! Can you at least
tell me where we're going?

93
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,666
I'll explain later.

94
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,000
No, now! I thought I asked you
to do something for me anyway.

95
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,791
I guess the rice cooker's fixed?

96
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,375
I can fix it later!

97
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,000
You need to do it now!
And when you're done with that,

98
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,541
the outside windows
need cleaning, so move!

99
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,958
Look, I don't have the
gear for that kind of job.

100
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,958
Besides, you're not
in charge of Atlas, too!

101
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,625
Huh. No wonder you
quit the Army, lazybones.

102
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,583
List-en! There's
something important you

103
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,166
and I need to talk about!

104
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,500
And I guess it's more important
than fixing the rice cooker?!

105
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,916
Stop. Let's break up
this lover's quarrel.

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,291
Lover's quarrel?!
With her? With him?

107
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:23,166
Simmer down. Children,
get your priorities straight.

108
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,666
Love always comes first.

109
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,666
"Love"?!

110
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,708
You mustn't deny
what fate demands.

111
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,375
Forget your troubles
and just hold hands.

112
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,208
Ya see? Feels right, yes?

113
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,291
I'm happy to entertain myself,
but an invitation to join them

114
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:45,166
would've been the polite
thing to do. C'est la vie.

115
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:50,625
Phoenix came from ashes. Right?

116
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,041
Look. Ya see that?

117
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,250
Guess not.

118
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,875
It's right in front
of ya. Look carefully.

119
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:06,625
All I see is burning rubble.
As far as you look.

120
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:11,500
Wait a sec. This isn't some
kinda creepy message is it?

121
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,875
Dunno. Could be.

122
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,791
I don't have time for this crap!
Let go of me, jerk-wad!

123
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,750
You're being silly!
Stop yelling.

124
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,500
Let go!

125
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,291
Calm down!

126
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,500
Don't touch me!

127
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,500
Are you alright?

128
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,333
What the--?

129
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,250
Thought so.

130
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,833
You thought what?!

131
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,791
Let me see that thing.

132
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,625
It's gone. But how?

133
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,208
Do you suppose
they've seen the sign?

134
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:15,333
By now? It's in
their blood isn't it?

135
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,666
After the
fires subsided, voila.

136
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,541
You think they've
been there all along?

137
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:22,833
Yeah.

138
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,125
If you patrol
around Atlas's perimeter,

139
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,666
these lines are
all over the place.

140
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,166
Anywhere you look,
you can find them.

141
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,541
Making patterns that
are part of this larger one.

142
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,875
Woah. And right at
the center of it all...

143
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,666
Atlas.

144
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:49,958
They spoke to us. Showed us
what was to be our future.

145
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,375
The ley lines were
revealed. It was as if

146
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,875
the quake swept Tokyo aside,

147
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:59,166
in order to show us
the true axis mundi.

148
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,750
At the nexus,
we'd construct a pillar.

149
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,500
We could channel Earth's
energy to lift the sky.

150
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,583
Praying, of course,
that would stabilize our world.

151
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,833
We would create a
new center of the World.

152
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:15,875
One which would attract
prosperity, emanate power.

153
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,333
Complete and utter nonsense.

154
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:22,458
Maybe so. But you certainly
believed in it back then, yes?

155
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,333
Blinded by
something, insanity or--

156
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:29,500
Whatever the case, I swore
my life and fortune to it.

157
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,916
Despite the most
sophisticated technology,

158
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,708
we could not
rectify the crucial issue:

159
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,000
the mechanical resonance.

160
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,416
In desperation,
we traveled down that dark path

161
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,375
that leads beyond
what science can explain.

162
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,750
Dark indeed. We abandoned
the light of reason

163
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,083
and bloodied our hands

164
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,500
with the act that set
the grim cycle in motion.

165
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,958
We tried to satisfy
the monster's craving.

166
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:57,083
Provide Hiruko with
fresh souls in which to reside.

167
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:00,041
Young children shy
of their seventh year.

168
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,125
The blood of many innocents
was needed to slake its thirst.

169
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:07,375
But eventually,
the tremors subsided.

170
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,458
A structure built
on stolen lives.

171
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:15,958
Atlas is nothing more than
an elaborate grave marker.

172
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:23,583
I don't need reassurance.
Regret is a useless feeling.

173
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,166
We carry our deeds
with us like it or not.

174
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,791
Yes, you're right.
And like Atlas,

175
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:32,208
we shall shoulder our burdens
until the bejeweled spear,

176
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,166
leaves the earthen
grip that holds it.

177
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:40,166
It's strange. Like we've
stumbled upon the occult.

178
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,833
Or a "creepy message."

179
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:45,333
Yeah, no joke. Do you mind
if I borrow this for a bit?

180
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,333
I don't really
like not having it.

181
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,875
Besides, don't you
have your own, anyway?

182
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:52,791
Oh crap!

183
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,458
I did, but I traded
it to that girl Karin.

184
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,750
What? But why?!

185
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,125
Well, she promised
to throw in an extra bomber

186
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,791
if I handed over the knife.

187
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,583
You are such a sucker!

188
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,791
Don't lecture me!

189
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,416
Thanks a lot, butterfingers!

190
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,000
It was an accident!

191
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,708
You okay?!

192
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,625
I'm fine. Just
get the damn blade!

193
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,958
Right!

194
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,791
Aw shit!

195
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,791
Once again did
our amulet resound

196
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,958
with such a heavenly tone.

197
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,208
Excuse me, miss.

198
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,416
Karin, what bids thee here?

199
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,416
I come bringing a
gift for you, my lady.

200
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,458
I think you'll like it.

201
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,625
How did you get those blades?!

202
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,458
What difference does
it make how I got them?

203
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,916
You've been looking
for them and here they are.

204
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,666
What's more, I believe
this completes the collection.

205
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,458
Am I right?

206
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,208
They bear uncanny resemblance
to the one we possess.

207
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,666
In fact, the very
same through and through.

208
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:11,500
'Tis true, milady. These
blades will secure your ascent

209
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,750
to the highest level of Atlas.

210
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,875
Splendid Karin.
Bless thy name.

211
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,458
It's an honor to serve.

212
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,833
Prepare a carriage immediately!

213
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:24,166
Atlas cries out,
for our triumph!

214
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,708
Karin Ishida you say?

215
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:30,166
Yes, ma'am. On behalf of Digma
One, she requests entrance.

216
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,458
It seems the
conditions have been met.

217
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:38,958
Very well. Send a party to greet
them. Out of pure necessity.

218
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,125
Was that smooth, or what?

219
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,458
"You're the
luckiest girl I know!"

220
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,000
I worked my tail off
to get Mikuni in place.

221
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,666
Surely my role as benefactor
and advocate will be rewarded

222
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,291
once she's
in charge. And then--

223
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,625
"The cash'll come rollin' in!"

224
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:56,958
Hey, Karin!

225
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,083
Oh look, Sister Mary Robert!

226
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,541
You can go back to calling me

227
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,958
"Klaris, the
richest girl you know."

228
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,708
Oh yeah? You rode my coattails
straight to the bank, did ya?

229
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:07,916
"No fair."

230
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,208
All's fair in love
and finance, darling.

231
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,208
But seriously, you gotta
spill the beans about

232
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,166
how you sunk the carbon index!

233
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,208
I'd love to tell ya how
it happened, but I can't.

234
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,583
Why?

235
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,833
Medusa's totally leaving
me in the dust here, Klaris.

236
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,000
I can't keep up
with the investment paths.

237
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,958
I even just tried asking
directly, but mum's the word.

238
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,333
Like it's ignoring you?

239
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,458
When I was hacking
into Zeus a while ago

240
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,541
I gave Medusa its
own top user priority.

241
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,666
Everything's that's
happened since then has gone on

242
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,416
without any input from me.

243
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,708
All we gotta do is play
around and spend the money

244
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,291
Medusa makes for us? Kick ass!

245
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:46,333
Yeah... I guess.
Alright, Medusa!

246
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,541
Let's see if you can make
me the wealthiest gal ever!

247
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,208
Karin!

248
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,625
Zhang!

249
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,625
We have a strict, no-backstabber
policy at our clubhouse,

250
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,500
so take your
apologies and hit the road.

251
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,125
I didn't come
here for that anyway,

252
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,000
we've got a major storm
brewing here! It's Antarctica!

253
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:05,125
Give me a break.
Now that's just stupid.

254
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:08,958
No! Listen! Medusa's taking out
its head leases on Antarctica.

255
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,250
What in the heck?

256
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,541
If you look at the ledgers
for the Carbon Bank of Japan,

257
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,958
there's a contract there

258
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,916
for the purchase of
7% of the Antarctic continent.

259
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,458
But that makes zero sense.
There's like, nobody even there.

260
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:21,666
"Zero" is right!

261
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,583
Antarctica isn't
a part of any other nation.

262
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,083
It's unclaimed.
Its asset value is zero.

263
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,500
So it's just gonna keep
buying until it's outta money?

264
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,958
Then what?

265
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,625
Then the carbon index that
Medusa artificially lowered

266
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,791
bounces back like crazy.
The market basically

267
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,916
eats itself alive until
there's nothing left of value!

268
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,166
Uh-oh.

269
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,250
There, all better!
Luckily, it's just a scratch.

270
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,166
Yeah! From a bullet!
That wasn't just bad luck.

271
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,791
Those guys were looking for us.
But who put them up to it?

272
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,250
Aw, stop grumbling
and let's go.

273
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,166
I'll tag along
and help you look for 'em.

274
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,458
You'll help?! That'd be great!

275
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,458
Come on, I said
I was sorry, didn't I?

276
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,916
Again? Get a room you two.

277
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Momoko!

278
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:10,083
In the flesh. You poor thing.

279
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,666
Did you get a boo-boo?

280
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,666
It's nothing, I'm fine.

281
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,166
Indeed, but Mama can
make everything all better.

282
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,250
A little kiss and
you'll forget all about it.

283
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,250
No. Please don't.

284
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,833
Oh, almost forgot. The Metal Age
guys wanted me to tell you,

285
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,083
the infernal geezer
trio's made contact.

286
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,208
Really? That's great news!

287
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:39,458
Yes, they survived, apparently
they have cockroach DNA.

288
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,625
You're gonna molest me like
that and then just walk away?

289
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,666
I'm sorry hon, you're
just such a bad kisser.

290
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,958
You are the most
evil little tramp I know!

291
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:48,666
Where my bell curve's
concerned, he's barely a four.

292
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,791
My... first kiss.

293
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:56,208
Hiya pervs! You guys
made it through the fire!

294
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:59,833
Of course! It's the fire
within us that truly counts!

295
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,166
Give us a smile, dear!

296
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,583
Coochie-coochie-coo!

297
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,166
Furukawa! Looks like
you made it to Akihabara,

298
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,166
safe and sound!

299
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,958
He narrowed his
focus and took the shot!

300
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,250
He has the right
mettle to forward our cause!

301
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,375
BAUM-BOMBOMBOMBOM-BOM-BAAUUMM!

302
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,375
They are just so cute!

303
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,416
I hope poor Furukawa's
had all his shots.

304
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,125
Now the reason we've
broken our radio silence.

305
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,875
We've obtained some intelligence
you may find a bit disturbing.

306
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,666
War is being
waged over Antarctica.

307
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,958
And the commanding
general is calling the shots

308
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,250
from right here
in our own territory.

309
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,666
What are you doing?!

310
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,916
Medusa's gone too far.
So I need to take back control!

311
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,291
You don't have time!

312
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,541
You gotta get outta
there as fast as you can Karin!

313
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,416
Where's the fire this time?!

314
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,833
All over you,
when Titan gets there!

315
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,666
Oh yeah? What's that mean!

316
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,958
There's a humongous
warship coming!

317
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,166
So what? That's no big deal.

318
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,458
A little typhoon
should take that thing out.

319
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,625
Right. Over Tokyo?

320
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,875
Don' you get it? It's not
targeting the islands this time!

321
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,000
It's you!

322
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,166
What?!

323
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,333
Titan is entering the
skies over Iturup Island!

324
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,791
This is an airspace violation!

325
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,708
Where the hell
are our defenses?!

326
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:20,125
You are violating
Japanese airspace.

327
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:24,500
I repeat. You are
violating Japanese airspace.

328
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,958
Please withdraw immediately.

329
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,750
We are operating
under jurisdiction

330
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,500
of the United Nations.

331
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,291
Stand down.

332
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,541
They're U.N. forces.

333
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,000
Hiding behind the
anti-Medusa resolution.

334
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,791
Then why the hell
are they coming to Tokyo?

335
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:44,375
It's here. Titan is now
in the airspace over Honshu.

336
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,416
The U.N. forces are insisting
that Medusa is illegally being

337
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,041
harbored somewhere
inside Tokyo.

338
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,750
Should we contest and
try to stave off the attack?

339
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:57,666
Since I gave them the
coordinates, I think not.

340
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,083
Madam Ryoko?!

341
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,500
What's wrong? We do know
the Neo-Guild is the main force

342
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,333
behind that venomous
snake do we not?

343
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,916
Bring it on!
Show me whatcha got!

344
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Karin! You're wasting
precious time with this!

345
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,166
Just get outta there!

346
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,500
We're not playing
around, this is serious!

347
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,000
I can't let it end like this!

348
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,541
They take my money,
I'm as good as dead!

349
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,583
I'm a Neo-Carbonist!
Cash is my life's blood!

350
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:22,875
The cloud this kicks up

351
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,500
should sufficiently
obscure the moon, yes?

352
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,583
That's the reason?

353
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,750
Well, that's not the only one.

354
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,166
Mikuni won't deign to enter
Atlas without her little pet.

355
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,083
And who wants that?

356
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,541
It's much simpler this way.

357
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:46,625
Foolish witch! Strike me down
and the pillar will crumble!

358
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,041
The heavens shall fall!

359
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,541
Miiko, calm thyself!

360
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,333
Milady, we must leave this
place, and that thing behind.

361
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,666
We shall not!

362
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,458
We shall enter Atlas
with dear Miiko at our side!

363
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,583
Vile creature!

364
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,583
Miiko.

365
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,958
Oh Moon! Soon your
light shall wane.

366
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:10,666
The end is nigh! I see it!

367
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,750
We must make our
way to Atlas at once.

368
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,875
Nothing can divert our path.

369
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:19,041
Miss Mikuni, we must
go and claim your destiny!

370
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,791
Worry not.
We shall return soon.

371
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,916
We shall fetch
thee, Miiko! We swear it!

372
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,375
Karin, please!

373
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,750
Hold on! I've just
about got him by the tail!

374
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:39,291
You're way too close to
being teddy bear barbecue!

375
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,833
Medusa. Come back!

376
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:45,958
Madam. Titan is now
honing in on Old Akihabara.

377
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,458
Gotcha!

378
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:57,583
And just when the poor night
bird was leaving her cage.

379
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,416
What a pity.

380
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,041
What was that?!

381
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:07,333
Hurry!

382
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,416
Okay!

383
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,041
Miiko!

384
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,041
But how?

385
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,666
Come, Miiko. We must
make our way into Atlas!

386
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,083
Miiko! Miiko!

387
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:46,041
Heart, burning for retribution.

388
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:50,083
The Moon Flower yearns to
bloom over soil awash in blood.

389
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,500
The writhing
serpent, fangs bared,

390
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,708
heralds winter without end.

391
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:57,583
Next time: "The Lost Holy Land"
