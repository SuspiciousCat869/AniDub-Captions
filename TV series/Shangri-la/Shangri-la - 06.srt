1
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,708
"Simply leave the details
to us, and I assure you

2
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:25,541
Orochi will be
brought to its knees."

3
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:27,708
Nothing like
contracting a teddy bear

4
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:30,375
to do the
government's dirty work, eh?

5
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,750
Minister, we're dealing
with a Neo Carbonist

6
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:36,791
whose stock portfolio alone puts
our combined assets to shame.

7
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:39,291
I strongly advise caution.

8
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:43,541
What is your organization's
interest in this proposal?

9
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,875
"Orochi's activities have
incurred significant losses for

10
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:50,000
our company. And every second
we let them proceed unchecked,

11
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:53,333
the carbon market as a whole
verges closer to total failure."

12
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,333
Yes, but what
recourse is there when we're

13
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:57,583
not even certain
where they operate from?

14
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:00,375
"We bait them out
onto a level playing field."

15
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,333
What? But how?

16
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:04,916
"Any country with a large
disparity between emissions

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,166
and GNP is blood in the water.

18
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,166
Orochi will go for
them in a heartbeat,

19
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,416
but if we act quickly, we can
get a lock on their location."

20
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:16,458
"By our calculations,
Kuwait is the perfect decoy

21
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:19,708
for such a scenario.
All Ishida Finance requires

22
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:23,625
to proceed is the Japanese
government's full cooperation."

23
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,541
What you're asking us
is tantamount to betrayal!

24
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:28,750
We cannot support
wreaking untold havoc

25
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,416
on a sovereign
nation's economy!

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,833
"That's not okay?" 

27
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:32,708
Of course not!

28
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:33,791
It's international law!

29
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,041
We shouldn't
have to explain this!

30
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,625
Why did we think we
could bank on a child.

31
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:37,958
"Shut up!"

32
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:40,333
"Your economy is heading
straight down the crapper!

33
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:42,458
Now, you can either
go along with my plan

34
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,375
that will make
both of us happy.

35
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,875
Or keep hanging on
to old-fashioned ideas of

36
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:51,125
"international manners" while
everyone else eats you alive!"

37
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,166
Wow. The markets 
are getting twisted.

38
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,166
They're getting
more than twisted.

39
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,625
They're on the
brink of utter collapse.

40
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,791
Is it really that serious?

41
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:36,500
It is indeed. That debacle
with the Saudi prime?

42
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,041
Just a taste
of things to come.

43
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:44,375
Stay sharp.
What we need is vigilance.

44
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,833
Someone, or something,
is lurking behind the scenes.

45
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,333
Even as we speak,

46
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:53,750
it coils in readiness for
the next unsuspecting victim.

47
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,041
What in the Hell are you doing?

48
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,333
Sir. Tendering my resignation.

49
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,958
I don't suppose
this has anything to do

50
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,041
with the mimetic armor gaffe?

51
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,791
Sir, yes it does.
I must atone--

52
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,666
Atone?! Screw-ups
don't fix themselves when

53
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,500
the parties responsible
throw in the towel!

54
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,791
Sir, I--

55
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,375
Shut the Hell up!
What happens when Metal Age

56
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,875
forks over that sample
to the highest bidder?

57
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,916
We're screwed! That's what...

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,208
But, thankfully,
there's a silver lining.

59
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,833
We marked it as classified,

60
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,458
but actually the tech's
just a spit-polished rehash

61
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,333
of the kinda crap that's
been out there for years.

62
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:32,208
All of our genuine technological
secrets are still secure.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,250
We got a call from
the Atlas Corporation.

64
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,583
Evidently someone
there feels very strongly

65
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,708
that you
shouldn't be reprimanded.

66
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:41,916
Atlas?!

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,250
Why would
the muckety-mucks

68
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,250
give a stale turd about
an enlisted man like you?

69
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,708
My entire career I've never once
taken a call like that before.

70
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,708
I don't really have
an explanation for you.

71
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,333
I come from
humble stock, sir.

72
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,541
We've never
lived above level four.

73
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,666
That so?
There was something else.

74
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,458
Another rather odd request.

75
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,041
Sir?

76
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:06,041
You've been called to make an
appearance at the Moon Palace.

77
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,708
Seriously?

78
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:12,541
So, our little night flower
has taken a shine to Kusanagi?

79
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,875
Indeed.

80
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,625
Please forgive
the intrusion, madam.

81
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,666
Go on.

82
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,333
It concerns the government's
plans to bait Orochi.

83
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,500
I've been apprised.
Sounds thrilling.

84
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,750
But Kuwait, madam.
We have a relationship there.

85
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,375
Yes, as does everyone.
Predicated absurdly

86
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,875
on their oil reserves.
Its fall is no concern of ours.

87
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,458
And, if the gambit fails,

88
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,250
Ishida Finance
will be held to account.

89
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,750
The brunt of the catastrophe
will be theirs to deal with.

90
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:54,625
Indeed.

91
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,250
But if they succeed,

92
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,166
Kuwait grows several
hundred million marks

93
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,750
richer in foreign aid.

94
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,875
A generous estimation.

95
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,708
Come, it's the least we
can do to express our thanks.

96
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,208
Someone has to play
the mouse in this game.

97
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,708
As you wish.

98
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:12,500
I should consult Zeus and
make all necessary preparations.

99
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:18,708
Shion?

100
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:19,750
Ma'am.

101
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,125
Relieve the
chef of his position.

102
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,291
His overuse of salt
betrays him for an amateur.

103
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes, of course.

104
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,791
Your cooking is the bomb!

105
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,583
I can't remember the last time
you've come home to visit us.

106
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,875
But, of course,
you're going right back out.

107
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,291
Look, I'm sorry.
I've got to be at some place

108
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,000
called the Moon Palace,
so I gotta motor soon.

109
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,333
Run that by me again?

110
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,250
I couldn't hear for
all the half-eaten veggies

111
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,208
knocking around in your mouth!

112
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,291
Give me a break for once, will
ya? I don't have a lot of time.

113
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,375
The brass has me all
over the friggin' map.

114
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,791
You know what a pain it is just
to work in this much of a break?

115
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:10,333
My, what a considerate son.
Here to unburden me of my food.

116
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:14,041
Aw. Take a pill.
I'm doin' this for you.

117
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,416
Old ladies go senile when they
don't got somethin' to bitch a--

118
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,791
Show some manners or people will
think you were raised by wolves!

119
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:27,541
Hey, Mom. Do we know someone?
Like with the higher ups?

120
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,791
Someone? Like who?

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,041
Nah, forget about it.
Dumb question.

122
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,708
So, uh. Can you tell
me anything about this

123
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,041
Mikuni I'm about
to be introduced to?

124
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,333
I mean, what can I expect?

125
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,750
Sir, your dagger
must be left here with me.

126
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,208
Oh, right.

127
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,958
Just be careful with it,
please. It's very old.

128
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:06,041
I assure you no
harm will come to it, sir.

129
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,583
Thank you.

130
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,583
Approach the dais,
Lieutenant Kusanagi.

131
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,750
Be seated.

132
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,291
It is an honor to be here.

133
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,916
We ask that your
face be not supine.

134
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:44,500
We are called Mikuni.
Scrutinize our countenance.

135
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,125
Is it lovely?

136
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,416
Um, no. Not especially.

137
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,208
Then eyes are
wasted on you, sir!

138
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:53,375
I highly recommend you modify
your observations to the facts!

139
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,583
Hold, Miiko.

140
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,083
Sorry, love. The boy's a fool.

141
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,625
Perhaps,

142
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,833
but one who hath spoken plainly
the truth as he doth see it.

143
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:02,916
Look there.

144
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,916
I'll be damned.

145
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,708
We would hear
depicted with equal candor

146
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,625
thy late dishonor, lieutenant.

147
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:14,583
Ah. Well, I--I was
captured by terrorists.

148
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,041
Thy captors must
have been most fearsome.

149
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:20,125
T'would seem no mean feat
to detain the likes of you.

150
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah, but.,, The one
responsible was actually

151
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,708
just some stupid kid.

152
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:26,625
Oh dear!

153
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,250
Indeed.

154
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:33,500
This surpriseth us.
Doth thine enemy boast of boys

155
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,833
whose dimensions belie them?

156
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,750
No, it was a girl.

157
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,708
Impressive how
long he's lasted with her.

158
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,291
Heaven knows it's rare.

159
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,583
I don't know that
I care for this trend.

160
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,041
He represents three such
souls who have piddled through

161
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:51,291
her ladyship's trial
without so much as a mark.

162
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:58,750
What's so special about you?
Where's your ranking?

163
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:03,541
The Hell?! I'm using
her ladyship's password!

164
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,958
What earthly reason
would the Atlas Corporation

165
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,041
have for shielding his records?

166
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,125
Damn it!

167
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,791
Research team.
What of his blade?

168
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,041
We've subjected it
to a battery of tests.

169
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,791
All our data
points to it's being,

170
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,291
well, basically identical.

171
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,250
Not a chance!

172
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,041
But for slight
variation due to exposure,

173
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,416
the contours are
virtually indistinguishable.

174
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,083
And mind you, it's not as though
they've been cast from a mold.

175
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,708
They're rather
like two masterful copies

176
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,666
of a common antecedent.

177
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,791
Would it be possible for us

178
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,125
to obtain a sample
for further testing?

179
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:39,166
We have to return it to him
intact. Can you craft a fake?

180
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,500
Not on such short notice, no.

181
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,916
That's all, then.
We have what we have.

182
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,083
The blade will
remain a mystery.

183
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,541
Yes, ma'am.

184
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:55,416
What are you hiding, lieutenant?
How did you come by that blade?

185
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,791
And why do the Atlas drones
have your records fenced off?

186
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:07,458
Ah. How frustrated she must've
been to come up empty-handed.

187
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,291
No doubt shaking her
fists as we speak, madam.

188
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:13,250
Clever mix
of metaphors, Soichiro.

189
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,916
Still, if Sayako
could trudge this far..

190
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,333
our Hiruko must be in agony.

191
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,958
One might almost
feel pity for the child.

192
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:30,416
The Moon and The Land!
They've mingled!

193
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,333
The day of
fulfillment is upon us!

194
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,625
Are you trying to
give me a heart attack?!

195
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:09,041
Your back was wide open. You're
old enough to know better, hon.

196
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,041
Enemies don't always
bust through the front door.

197
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,250
But how did you--?

198
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,708
It's amazing
how nimble you can be

199
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,958
when you check
your luggage at the curb.

200
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,958
Don't be such a grouch.

201
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,375
You have to read the
weapon's path, sweetie.

202
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,166
And not throw like
an angry hairdresser.

203
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,083
So what's eating you?

204
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,875
All the markets
are acting weird.

205
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,208
You don't say?

206
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,500
Son of a--!

207
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,125
You're putting way too
much force behind the grab.

208
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:45,333
Treat it like a lover.
Nice and gentle.

209
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,791
So... The markets
are all worked up...?

210
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,541
'kay, this'll
prolly sound nuts,

211
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:53,458
but when they fluctuate,
I can, like, feel it.

212
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,791
Oo la la!

213
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,041
Oh grow up!

214
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,500
Sorry.

215
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:02,875
They writhe. Then come
together like a big snake.

216
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,000
This, evil thing
crawling right underneath us.

217
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,833
It's a predator,
hunting down countries

218
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,041
with a sizable carbon balance.

219
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,666
See, it ensnares them by
offering to take out a lease

220
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,333
on their debt.
They can't resist.

221
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,166
Money starts pouring
in from overseas, sure,

222
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,583
but the stocks
are basically worthless.

223
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,291
So when push comes to shove
all that foreign investment

224
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,708
capital just
picks up and leaves.

225
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,416
The whole thing's a scam.

226
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,583
All it really reduces are
the index numbers themselves.

227
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:36,208
And countries struggling to make
ends meet get laid to waste.

228
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:39,916
Yeah. The victim of,
what do they call it?

229
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,291
A bulb economy?

230
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,833
Bubble economy.

231
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:46,041
Yeah, yeah. So this "snake"
creates one wherever it pleases?

232
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:50,125
In laymen's terms. Only in this
case the scale is much larger

233
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,833
and the cycle much shorter.

234
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,791
Even the strongest
countries are prey.

235
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:00,041
Oh, right. The Grande
Dame wants to see you.

236
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:03,333
Something to do
with serpents, I think.

237
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,750
This intel comes
to us care of a mole

238
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,750
Takehiko has planted
in the Atlas Corporation.

239
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,916
Apparently, the government
is going to try its hand

240
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,625
at slaying monsters.

241
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,291
What's their plan? No way!

242
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,541
Oh yes, child. They intend
to hook another country

243
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,541
through the gills and
dangle them like a minnow.

244
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:25,958
They can't do that!

245
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:29,416
There's, like,
a gazillion laws against it!

246
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,708
Kuniko. That's
no deterrent to them.

247
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,458
A country in dire
straits brooks no threat,

248
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,416
however many laws
have to be discarded.

249
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,000
Survival plays
by its own rules.

250
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,125
Alright, people. Commence!

251
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,583
Is this Imai
Financial Holdings?

252
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,625
Sell!

253
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:51,958
Now selling
shares in Kuwait Oil!

254
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,666
Flood the market!
Pump in whatever you have to!

255
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,791
Our assets are plummeting
like a skydiver without a chute.

256
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,166
Whatever you lose today
will buy this country's

257
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,541
security tomorrow,
so keep that in mind.

258
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,291
They've begun.

259
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,750
Do we have stock in Kuwait?

260
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,583
I pulled us out in time.

261
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:16,583
Carbon index: a hundred
thirty-eight point seventy nine.

262
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,208
A number for the record
books if ever I've seen one.

263
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,916
The Kuwaitis are buying to
drive up the value of course,

264
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,416
but too late.

265
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,708
Too late by half.
That's it for them.

266
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,041
As of this moment,
they're bankrupt.

267
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:34,625
And the ripple effect sends
the Middle East into free fall.

268
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:38,083
Now the EU is scrambling
to protect the euro bloc.

269
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:42,458
A hurry up and wait
game for them. Or not?

270
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,875
It's here!

271
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,208
That's him.

272
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:56,458
Take a good hard look,
child. Commit it to memory.

273
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,000
Kuwait's carbon index dropped!

274
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,541
One point fifteen. A nation
formerly up to its eyeballs

275
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,208
in debt has the same
credit rating as Japan.

276
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,750
But how?

277
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,791
By slapping a lien on
their oil fields, essentially.

278
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,291
That's a financial
vacuum no bank in the world

279
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,333
can resist filling.

280
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,333
Look there.

281
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,833
The smaller banks
go belly up first.

282
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,000
But the high rollers
know if they hang on,

283
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,041
the earnings are exponential.

284
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,791
Question is, can they hang on?

285
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,291
A hundred sixty-trillion?!

286
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,666
Is the cash investors have
lying around infinite or what?

287
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,625
Are the banks that reckless?!

288
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:41,208
Oh, there's a whole other
game afoot. Can't you see it?

289
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,208
Grandma! Check the
banks underwriting the assets

290
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,291
and see if
they're in bed with

291
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,041
the ones underwriting
the liabilities!

292
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,916
You see the patterns
underneath it all.

293
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,083
Yeah! They're
leasing the oilfields

294
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,791
back to the Kuwaiti government!

295
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:59,333
Bingo. And in a
moment, they'll pull out.

296
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:03,291
It's gone. Damn!
A hundred and sixty trill.

297
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,666
All of it right back
in the vaults. At interest.

298
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,875
The monster has fled.
Now clear your mind and focus.

299
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,125
Visualize the global market.

300
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,916
Let the beast
present itself to you.

301
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,833
Where are you?
A gap? A tiny fissure?

302
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,708
Got him! That's it! That's
where the bastard sleeps!

303
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,250
The Maldives!

304
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,750
Where in the Maldives? It's
still a needle in a haystack!

305
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,583
Zeus has it narrowed
down to twelve points,

306
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,416
but that's as
specific as it can get!

307
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,041
"They've set up
dummy corporations

308
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,041
to throw us off the scent."

309
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,375
I'm getting more impressed
with them by the minute.

310
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:52,125
Where is he hiding?
Come on. Focus!

311
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,833
Show me water
level stats around Esath!

312
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,958
Okay, see.
Those are way too low.

313
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,291
Oh wow.

314
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,750
They've dropped
thirty centimeters

315
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,416
just in the last hour.
That's crazy.

316
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,875
Is that our quarry?

317
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,541
Yes, it is!

318
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:12,291
Huh. Lookie there.
We're locked on.

319
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,125
Orochi is nested
on Esath Island, ma'am.

320
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,833
And this comes from where?

321
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,791
Evidently from Metal Age.

322
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,291
They're posting by
proxy on several forums.

323
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,583
Don't be crazy. By inference
you're saying they have

324
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,083
access to a system
superior to Zeus.

325
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,666
They might.

326
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,291
They do possess the Sun.

327
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,083
Pass the information
on to America immediately.

328
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:36,250
And as for Kuwait,
cut them a nice check.

329
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,958
But, mail it out tomorrow.

330
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,541
Yes, as you wish.

331
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,291
What's the matter?

332
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,666
How come you look so exhausted?

333
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,833
Slaying monsters
takes a lot out of a girl.

334
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,958
I'm entitled
to look exhausted.

335
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:57,875
Okay.

336
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,375
Geez! I'm kidding!

337
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,833
No, I get ya. Things are
pretty rough all over, huh?

338
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:02,958
Don't go thinkin' this has

339
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,708
anything to do
with Metal Age, either.

340
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,375
'course not. Look at you.

341
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:10,000
You're a perfectly
normal teenage girl, right?

342
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:14,791
Damn right. Who just
happens to know folks.

343
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,625
Folks she freeloads off of.

344
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,833
Thanks for
the self-esteem boost.

345
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,125
Good afternoon to you.
News today from overseas.

346
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,041
The U.S. defense
department confirmed

347
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:28,250
its fire-bombing of Ehsoth,
a small island situated among

348
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,916
the South Pacific Maldives,
earlier this morning.

349
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,291
Do what?!

350
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,791
Asked to clarify. A white
house spokesperson said

351
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,916
the attacks were "harsh,
but necessary to prevent

352
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,166
further disruption
in the carbon markets."

353
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,291
The Federation of South
Pacific Islands has logged

354
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,708
severe public
outcry against the action.

355
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,208
And tensions
continue to escalate

356
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,083
between the two nations.

357
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,208
You gotta love that
yankee flair for the dramatic.

358
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,458
Just thank heavens
the markets are stable.

359
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,416
"So. Safe to assume
this collaborative exercise

360
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,791
has sufficiently endeared
you to Ishida's resources?"

361
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,708
Uh. I think so, yes.

362
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,416
Typical U.S. overkill.

363
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Three fuel-air bombs on
a nothing little isthmus.

364
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,416
They're stuck in last-century.

365
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,666
Good old fashioned
American nanny-ism.

366
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,083
The markets are
all responding in kind.

367
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:17,750
Not that their list of
friends was long to begin with.

368
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,041
The U.S. carbon
index has spiked.

369
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,875
Heh. So much for aid.

370
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:25,166
By this time tomorrow our
hundred million will be pitiful.

371
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,625
You're not appalled?

372
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:31,791
It's a write off. And
either way, getting to witness

373
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:35,125
The Sun's instincts in
action is well worth the loss.

374
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,000
Shion.

375
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,541
Yes, Madam Ryoko?

376
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,875
Ready my horse. I need air.

377
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,208
Ma'am.

378
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,708
Well, the markets
appear to be stable

379
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,666
for the foreseeable future.

380
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,000
Provided no one takes it

381
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,083
into their head to
follow Orochi's example.

382
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,958
Are you trying
to clean me out?!

383
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:56,125
I'd have been better off
setting my portfolio on fire!

384
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,458
Yes, I agreed to
help take down Orochi,

385
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,208
but that hit could've
totally finished me!

386
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,833
Boo hoo. I told
you not to short sell.

387
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:07,000
Oh, whatever! A Neo-Carbonist
worthy of the name trades

388
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,375
down to the last
nanosecond and you know it!

389
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,291
You didn't have to
pick on Kuwait anyway!

390
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,541
You just did
it to keep me from

391
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,083
getting that new outfit
'cause you're jealous--

392
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,375
Yeah, yeah.
Bankruptcy's a bitch.

393
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,291
Oh, I'll show you a--

394
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,416
Congratulations, Karin.

395
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Tarsian! Don't gloat.

396
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,125
For your information
I'm not the least bit

397
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,000
surprised you're
behind this mess.

398
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,875
Not even a little?
Well, maybe when your pride

399
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,708
and joy reacts to seeing
a copycat program snuffed out

400
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:38,000
for doing exactly what he does,
that jade casing will crack.

401
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,625
They grow up so fast, don't
they? Forming new synapses.

402
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:45,166
Making connections.
Tying their own shoes.

403
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,625
That was my aim
in all this, you know.

404
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,208
Bravo. Is that all?

405
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,708
Hmmm. Maybe.

406
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,125
Operation Digma
Two Net. Commence.

407
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:47,625
Crashing against the bars of
her cage like a beast in heat,

408
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:51,291
l'enfant terrible spares
no thought for gratitude.

409
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,958
How shrill and
tedious children are.

410
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:57,833
Next time: "Sad Thoughts
of Love and Hate"
