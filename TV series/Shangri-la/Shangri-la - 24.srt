1
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:24,208
You're going down!

2
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:33,083
Bravo, my dear.
I'm impressed by your progress.

3
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,875
Perhaps I should give
you a reward of some kind?

4
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,250
Oh, of course!

5
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,958
You can release the
sacred spear from its moorings.

6
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,208
It scarcely matters
which of you does it.

7
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,750
The pair of you
are interchangeable

8
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,208
as far as I'm concerned.

9
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,791
You expect me to fall
in line just like that?!

10
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,291
Alas. No.

11
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:57,416
Quid pro quo.
You release the spear

12
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,583
and I'll release
your little sister.

13
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,000
My what?!

14
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:04,666
Oh, I thought surely
you'd puzzled that much out.

15
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:09,583
Tell us witch!
Where art our mother!

16
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:12,041
No longer with us, I'm afraid.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,083
Though not exactly dead.

18
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,541
What do you mean?!

19
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:19,000
Strictly speaking, neither
of you were born naturally.

20
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,916
You were both
biologically-engineered

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,375
toward a specific purpose.

22
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,291
You're lying.

23
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:31,250
Just bear with me.
The timing's far too perfect

24
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:34,208
for me not to
divulge your origins.

25
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:37,916
The body of a woman
named Himiko once lay here.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,375
Her genetic
descendants have been

27
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:42,291
cross-bred for
generations to produce...

28
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:43,458
Mikuni.

29
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,625
So what am I then?
Some kind of mistake?

30
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:52,291
Not at all. You are
no less than Himiko herself.

31
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,625
So, Digma Two
is actually a clone?

32
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:57,000
Precisely. We felt
it was the best way to

33
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:00,416
ensure an unbroken line
of heirs to the Atlas project.

34
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,791
Hence, Digma One and Two.

35
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:06,625
And Digma Zero was the
prototype. Makes sense.

36
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,958
So what in the hell does
that make Hot Stuff here?

37
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,541
You think I'm a clone too?!

38
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,875
He's actually a
natural descendant.

39
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,916
Haruko was well aware of
the fact, but sworn to secrecy

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,416
lest you be misused
by the powers that be.

41
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,833
It must have
been hard for her.

42
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:26,416
So why exactly has Ryoko
parsed down her choices?

43
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,083
She deems it crucial for
the heir to be both obstinate

44
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:33,708
and self-possessed. You were
simply just too nice of a guy.

45
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,583
Well, I can
think of worse fates.

46
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,791
My soul belongs to Atlas.

47
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,583
Zeus is powerful
and the stress it places

48
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,750
on Ryoko's body takes
an enormous physical toll.

49
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,750
She now requires
a surrogate on which

50
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,708
to transfer her consciousness.

51
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,500
Time is running out on her.

52
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:59,375
She means to fully inhabit
one of those two girls.

53
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:00,833
What?

54
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:02,916
What's happening?!

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,833
I--I don't know!
Level Eight!

56
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,750
All that bullshit
about "humanity's future."

57
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,291
A future built on the
massacre of innocents.

58
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,666
Well, it's time
we paid the piper.

59
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,500
Switching over
to emergency power.

60
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,625
Why the hell
did Soichiro have to

61
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,500
pick a time like
this to go AWOL?

62
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:37,208
No, he-- It isn't
what you think. Believe me.

63
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:40,000
What in heaven's name is
happening on Level Eight?!

64
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,291
Educated guess? The central
shaft has taken a hit

65
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,125
from the Daedalus onslaught.

66
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:49,916
Well, if your ideals aren't
worth sacrificing for one life,

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,416
perhaps you can lay down
your swords to save billions?!

68
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,375
Medusa! Burn it all to ash!

69
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,208
Medusa has gained
complete control of

70
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,208
the U.N.'s primary network.

71
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,708
Kuniko.

72
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,625
Damn you, make it stop!

73
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,250
Not really up
to me, though, is it?

74
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,750
You're the only one
who can stop this now.

75
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,708
Yes. Good girl.

76
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,500
Yes! Excellently
done, my dear!

77
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,291
Except, I'm afraid
we're a bit belated.

78
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,375
Multiple missile
launches confirmed!

79
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,458
Now calculating total
volume of dust released into

80
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:10,666
Earth's atmosphere by
explosions. 30 billion tons.

81
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,750
Sufficient volume
to induce nuclear winter.

82
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,333
Objective achieved.

83
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,041
Water levels will
decrease proportionally

84
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,833
to global temperatures.

85
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,208
Continued existence secured.

86
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:29,125
Floodgates no longer
necessary. Commence opening.

87
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,833
No. No!

88
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,875
Confirming Marshall
Island Floodgates open.

89
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:43,500
A virtual nuclear winter. Hard
to believe it took the bait.

90
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,375
Well, if Medusa
had physical form,

91
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,791
I'm certain the ruse would've
been detected immediately.

92
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,541
Lucky us, I suppose.

93
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,208
So, are we out
of the woods now, or?

94
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,458
We're in Karin's debt.

95
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,458
At the eleventh
hour she hacked into

96
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:59,958
Medusa's OS core and
dramatically rewrote it.

97
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:04,333
Help me. Help me.
Help me. Help me.

98
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:08,583
I'm sorry. I am.
All I ever wanted was to

99
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,500
sit down to
dinner with my parents.

100
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:14,291
And all you wanted
was a dry place to feel safe.

101
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,458
All we hoped for out of
life reduced to a single thing.

102
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:22,166
Help me. Help me.
Help me. Help me.

103
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,458
Help me...

104
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,666
I will murder that little slut!

105
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,916
The world hath not
yet been made to end.

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,291
Oh, it's not been
total defeat on my part.

107
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,708
I still have a young
and lovely new body to use

108
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,625
as a vessel, don't I?!

109
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,875
Behold, ruler of old, thy shaman
queen, from earth arisen.

110
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,583
Himiko.

111
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,666
That sounded pretty authentic.

112
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,291
You'll pay dearly
for this insolence!

113
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:35,041
You've not won. All of
Atlas will soon collapse.

114
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:39,083
Don't sell us short. Humanity's
survival doesn't hinge on Atlas.

115
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,833
We've crawled out
from the rubble before

116
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,958
and we'll do it again!

117
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:47,083
Foolish creatures. Your every
dream amounts to rhetoric.

118
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,083
And I'll go on dreaming
whatever it amounts to!

119
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:53,208
So naive. That's what I love--

120
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,291
All levels have
been closed off!

121
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,666
The gates aren't
under our control!

122
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,916
Zeus does not take the
loss of its vessel lightly.

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,041
Ryoko's life force
is being absorbed

124
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,583
and diverted toward
Himiko's resurrection.

125
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,333
Why dost thou tremble?

126
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,291
The spear's going haywire.

127
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,291
It feels like it's trying
to pull me outta here!

128
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,458
Miss Mikuni.

129
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,708
Sayoko!

130
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,125
Thank heaven.

131
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,916
Thou art survived!

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,833
And so I shall
remain for as long as

133
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,125
you are in my life, milady.

134
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,583
Sayoko!

135
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,000
Hey!

136
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,000
Take care of my
little sis, will ya?

137
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,833
I kinda gotta go
save the world right now.

138
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:07,416
Brakes woulda been nice.
Where's the spear?!

139
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,916
Welcome back, hon.

140
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,500
You guys are alright!

141
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,583
It's not over though. We won't
be able to close the book

142
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,791
on all this until
Zeus is shut down.

143
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,375
Evidently not.

144
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,291
But I don't have the spear.

145
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,958
Then try this on for size.

146
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,541
Okay. Back it up.

147
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,208
Easy. Keep a grip on 'er.

148
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm applying
precisely the amount of

149
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,250
pressure needed
not to drop it.

150
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,791
The geezers are here?!

151
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,333
So whaddaya think
of Foorookawa's design?

152
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,500
Kudos to him for anticipating
the need for this baby.

153
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,875
A plucky heroine
needs her last hurrah.

154
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,791
Thank you, guys.

155
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,166
Miss President.

156
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,375
Make sure you
start it up manually.

157
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,125
Once the internal
reaction kicks in,

158
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,833
toggle this switch on the wing.

159
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,000
That'll engage the booster.
Don't assume you can

160
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,375
keep control of it
under you own strength, though.

161
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,750
And please note:

162
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,958
this button activates
the self-destruct sequence.

163
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,500
It would hardly be a
weapon without that feature.

164
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,916
Glasses twinkle!

165
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:07,916
Kuniko.

166
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,291
Best o' luck.

167
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,833
Before you go...

168
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,875
Take a good long look.

169
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,375
These are the people
that believe in you.

170
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,000
The folks who will be waiting.

171
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,083
Right!

172
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,000
Are we?

173
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:58,750
Yea. Thou art my image.
And I am thy own.

174
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:02,541
I am thus Kuniko.
Thou art Himiko.

175
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:06,583
Ye insolent gadflies hath
sorely run afoul of my design,

176
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,458
thus must I abjure mercy.

177
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,583
I shall use Atlas
to open the Dragon's Gate,

178
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,750
the force of which
shall carve a swath 'cross

179
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,875
the globe to
proclaim my rebirth.

180
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,958
To wit. Every soul within this
tower shall be made sacrifice.

181
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,416
The hell they will!

182
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,250
It's no use. We can't
man the gates from here.

183
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,083
Look, damn it.
Either we get them back online

184
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,666
or everyone in Atlas is dead!

185
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,416
Patience, gentlemen.

186
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,958
We have Kuniko.

187
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:36,583
I drew the contours of this
land from the outermost dark.

188
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,291
You defy she who
breathed order into chaos?

189
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,750
Damn right I do!

190
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,208
Whether you really
made the land or you didn't.

191
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,625
It belongs to
the future of those

192
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,416
who work to make it better!

193
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,416
Thou amuseth me greatly.

194
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,416
You don't get to mock us!

195
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,250
Let Atlas die.
We were fools to think

196
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,875
it was anything
more than a pipedream.

197
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,166
You're wrong about that.

198
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,875
Hope for humanity's
future was its cornerstone.

199
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,541
Says Ryoko's obedient dog.

200
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,750
Indeed. I would gladly
give myself, body, and soul

201
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,583
to whoever vouchsafed
the strength of Atlas.

202
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,416
Anything else would
only foster anarchy.

203
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,375
And I gladly dispatch those
whose interests run contrary

204
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,833
to the shape of
mankind's destiny.

205
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,375
Doesn't this place have
enough blood on its hands?

206
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,333
Well go right the hell on, then.

207
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:29,583
Somebody's eager
for oblivion, aren't they?

208
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,583
A coward like you
just wouldn't understand.

209
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,041
Probably.

210
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,833
The future of the
human race is nothing.

211
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:52,000
I happily see
it forfeit to my own.

212
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,791
That's what happens when
you come out guns blazing.

213
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,708
Guess what? It's not up to you
where humanity goes from here!

214
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:16,541
Got that?! Your will to live
has absolutely nothing on ours!

215
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,916
Now!

216
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,833
It's finally done.

217
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,666
Looks like the
controls are back online.

218
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,083
Safe to say that Digma Two
was worthy of your confidence.

219
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,625
But how did you know?

220
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:33,958
Oh I didn't know. I just
kept my faith in the girl.

221
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:42,083
Poppet. Poppet,
can you hear me?

222
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,791
Tis our Miiko!

223
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:49,625
Miiko!

224
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,166
There's my girl.

225
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,916
What happy luck! Thou
must swear an oath never

226
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,541
to leave our side
so long as we live!

227
00:14:56,625 --> 00:15:00,333
Alas, my body has long now
been free of its earthly vessel.

228
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,208
I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid I won't

229
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,750
be able to return to your side.

230
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,625
We understand
not what thou say'st.

231
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,750
Listen to me.
You need to understand.

232
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:15,291
Atlas' continued existence came
at a far more devastating price

233
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,750
than anyone
would prefer to admit.

234
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,750
A great many souls, a great
many children, were sacrificed.

235
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,916
And it's now my job
to guide these little ones

236
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,250
on their journey
into the hereafter.

237
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,750
Oh but darling,
I'm so very happy.

238
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,208
It goes without
saying I'll miss you.

239
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,041
But look how many
children being with you

240
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,708
has prepared
me to take care of.

241
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,875
Sayoko dear.

242
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,583
Watch over our brave
little girl, won't you?

243
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,083
As if there was
ever any question!

244
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,166
Before I go,
a special parting gift

245
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,958
from a tranny to
whom you mean the world.

246
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,416
Miiko.

247
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,125
Cinderella's gilded
coach turned back into

248
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,958
a pumpkin at the
stroke of midnight. But, hon.

249
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,458
This fairy godmother's
magic is permanent.

250
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:14,708
Miiko. Is--Is
this our last meeting?

251
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:20,000
Time's a-wastin', my poppet.
My work is cut out for me.

252
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,291
These little ones
are fabulously unruly.

253
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,625
Bye, Mikuni. Thanks.

254
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,166
Thou must not go!
Take us, please!

255
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,875
No! Unhand us!

256
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,250
Farewell, Lady Mikuni.

257
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,125
Miiko! Miiko!
Remove thy hands!

258
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:42,041
We shall follow Miiko
wherever she leads us!

259
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,333
Now, that's quite
enough of that, young lady!

260
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,041
Sayoko?

261
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,833
Listen. From this
moment forward,

262
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:57,041
the only mother
she will ever need is you.

263
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,291
You've always loved
her as your very own.

264
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,125
And the two of
you are a great team.

265
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,833
Miiko. Thank you.

266
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,791
Then let us nevermore be apart.

267
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,166
 Yasuko.

268
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:37,291
I'm broke. Medusa's gone.

269
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,958
Mom and dad are gone.
I've got nothing.

270
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,208
Ah, c'mon. Stop
feeling sorry for yourself.

271
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,583
The game's not over yet.

272
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,000
In fact, the world's
gearing up for the next round.

273
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,000
There's still money to be made!

274
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,708
I chartered a private
jet all the way here.

275
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,750
You could at
least acknowledge us.

276
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,333
Zhang!

277
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,833
I'm sorry. What
am I, chopped liver?

278
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:08,125
I was getting to you.
Don't take this wrong,

279
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,666
but you guys are kinda
older than I thought you'd be.

280
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,666
We were thinkin' the same
thing about you in reverse.

281
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,000
So that's Medusa?

282
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,708
Yeah. It's kinda hard
to believe the monster that

283
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:30,375
almost destroyed the world
came from this little chip.

284
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,000
Mama. Mama.

285
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:48,291
Awww. Oh baby.
Mama's right here!

286
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:52,125
Oh, how cute! That's
entirely too precious.

287
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,958
Let's not make the
same mistakes with this one.

288
00:18:56,541 --> 00:19:00,166
Hey little guy.
Show mama those eyes.

289
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,041
Well. Back to the
drawing board, I suppose.

290
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:15,583
You willing to tough it
out with me all over again?

291
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:19,416
Maybe. If you
play your cards right.

292
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,458
Looks like everyone made it out.

293
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,666
It's a miracle, considering
how little time we had.

294
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,000
So tell me. What are you two
going to do with yourselves?

295
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,625
This won't be our first
time living hand to mouth.

296
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,958
We're tough guys.
Between the pair of us,

297
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,250
I think we're
gonna do just fine.

298
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,416
Me too.

299
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,958
What about you?

300
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:42,041
Dunno. But the idea
of being with someone

301
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,916
is not without its charm.

302
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,000
My lifelong dream.
Hard to see it die.

303
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:53,458
Oh, come off it.
The dream hasn't any more died

304
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,458
than we've crawled
back into the slime.

305
00:19:56,541 --> 00:20:00,208
Well then. Let's go right
on dreaming as we always have.

306
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:03,916
We're an idle lot.
Fantasizing is what we do.

307
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,833
Oh, hey, you guys.

308
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,333
Oh my!

309
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,291
Are you alright being out
in the sun like this, sweetie?

310
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,833
Dear, Miiko's spirit
hath so generously renewed us.

311
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,250
We are released from both our
illness and our terrible power.

312
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,416
Miiko?

313
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,875
She always was a big softie.

314
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,666
 I'm so happy for you.

315
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,208
Should we now address
thee as elder sister?

316
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,875
Whatever floats
your boat, sugar plum.

317
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,833
But I think "big sis"
will do in a pinch.

318
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,875
So now what?
What'll you do?

319
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,625
You make it sound
like all's left is retirement.

320
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:53,083
Truth is there's so much I wanna
do I don't know where to start.

321
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,125
And why am I not surprised?

322
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,833
C'mon, surely
somethin's gotta stand out

323
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,750
among all your options.

324
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,791
There is one. Building
a place we can call home.

325
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,208
That's a big one.

326
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:07,583
Yep. The thing is, though,
it's gonna take everybody.

327
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,166
That's a given.

328
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,000
Sounds like
quite an undertaking.

329
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:15,750
It is. So I want a
lot of people's input on it.

330
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:19,083
It needs to be a place
where we would all wanna live.

331
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,625
The sort of home
where there's more than

332
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,666
enough room for happiness.

333
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:28,708
You'll laugh,
but I have a name for it.

334
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,916
We're gonna
call it Shangri-la!
