1
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,875
I think the cat wants in.

2
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:55,375
Toshizo's like, the most
"together" guy I've ever known.

3
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,500
Like he even cleaned my
room for me the other day,

4
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:01,750
and I didn't even ask him.
He was just, bein' nice.

5
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:06,458
This guy. He's like,
boyfriend number what?

6
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,833
This is Tower A
to HQ, reporting.

7
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:52,708
Everything is looking clear
at Shinokubo. Over and out.

8
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:53,750
Look!

9
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,166
What?

10
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:00,791
What the hell?!

11
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,250
What was that?

12
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,958
Come in HQ! We've had
a serious breach over here!

13
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,291
An armored train
just tore through the wall

14
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,791
and is now
heading straight into-

15
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,000
The train tracks!
Those bastards!

16
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,500
Look what you've
made me do, Kuniko.

17
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,291
Don't let this get messier.

18
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,166
I'm not in the mood for a date
if that's what you're after.

19
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,791
It looks like you've
got plenty of boys

20
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,583
to keep you company, anyway.

21
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,250
Quite cocky for
a stray, aren't we?

22
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,416
Let me take you
where you truly belong.

23
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,416
And where's that?

24
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,333
Inside a little cage.

25
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,416
I'll stay with freedom, thanks.

26
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,916
Not an option. We gave you
your freedom and you misused it.

27
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,833
That felonius bent
overwhelmed your better nature.

28
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,958
It's in society's best
interest for you to be

29
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,833
tucked away in a
more structured environment.

30
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,458
If you're placing
me under arrest,

31
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,750
just come out and say it.

32
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll stay with the carrot
and stick game, thanks.

33
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,166
Kuniko.

34
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,916
I had a feeling
that you'd play along.

35
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,708
Leave her alone!

36
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,291
What're you doing?!

37
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,416
This isn't helping!

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,541
You too!

39
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,833
Damn that kid!

40
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,458
I'm going with them!
If I don't they're just gonna

41
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,333
take it out on everyone here.

42
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,083
Are you sure?

43
00:04:56,166 --> 00:05:00,083
Relax will ya? It'll be nice
to get outta the city for a bit.

44
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,916
Alright, come on.

45
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,958
Hold up. I'm going with you!

46
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,125
Are you crazy?

47
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,000
Sorry little girl,
but we only got room for

48
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,208
criminals on this train, so--

49
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,583
No.

50
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:18,458
How about now? Ya think
you can squeeze me in?

51
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,500
You bet your ass I can!

52
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,625
Mommy. That's the
girl that helped me,

53
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:32,875
is she gonna be okay?

54
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,666
She and her friend
are both big girls.

55
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,583
They can take
care of themselves.

56
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,166
But how come
they're taking 'em away

57
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,458
if they're not
even in Metal Age?

58
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,666
They're gone. They took 'em.

59
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,125
I don't understand
what you're doing.

60
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,541
Aw. I wouldn't
lose any sleep over it.

61
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,291
They love me there,
so stick with me.

62
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:31,916
Today's the day!
The world's my oyster!

63
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:41,958
Listen up.

64
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:42,958
Shut it!

65
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:46,375
Today is the day!
Kuniko is back!

66
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,500
It's so quiet.

67
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,416
I know...

68
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:02,666
Bravo, child. I applaud your
portrayal of the returning hero.

69
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,875
Now take your bow.

70
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,375
So how're we gonna
get her out this time?

71
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,333
Right now, we're not.

72
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,458
All good things
to those who wait.

73
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,916
Right now we need to
focus on the short-term.

74
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,041
What should we start with, then?

75
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,458
Some pickles
should help to make her

76
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,833
feel more at home,
don't you think?

77
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,000
I don't want
her to feel at home,

78
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,041
I want her to be back at home!

79
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,833
What do you propose?

80
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,666
I start diggin'.

81
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:40,708
Things have changed. This center
is now under my authority.

82
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:44,250
Your experience here will be
quite different than last time.

83
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,041
Speaking of experience,
you've more crimes

84
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,625
under your belt
than when you left.

85
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,250
But such things
matter little to me.

86
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,833
I simply brought you here
so we could get acquainted.

87
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,041
What?

88
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,708
What beautiful
eyes you have. Oh, yes.

89
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,625
I think I'm going to like you.

90
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:13,333
Well, I already know I'm
gonna hate you! What the hell?!

91
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:18,000
The future holds so much for the
two of us. Such pleasures await.

92
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,666
What does that mean?

93
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,541
Away with her.

94
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,833
Ma'am.

95
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,833
Get your hands offa me!

96
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:37,916
Nao.

97
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,791
What's wrong?

98
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,708
No! Please! You gotta
let me outta here!

99
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:54,708
Shut your mouth!

100
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:55,875
I wanna go home!

101
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,041
Shut up!

102
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:16,333
Man, this is messed up.
I mean, how'd it get so bad?

103
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,208
Hey Kuniko.
Can you hear me in there?

104
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,291
Yeah, I'm here.

105
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,583
I'm scared. This place...

106
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,166
Aw, don't be scared.

107
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,625
They're just messin' with our
heads, tryin' to freak us out.

108
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,958
Hey. Listen.

109
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,291
What's up?

110
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,208
Back then. I never
meant for things to

111
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,958
turn out like they did.

112
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,250
Oh yeah? Well, you sure
as hell slapped that cop

113
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,291
like you meant it.

114
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,333
No. Two years ago.

115
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,250
When everything happened.

116
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:59,208
I get it. So... that's why.

117
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,291
I had to make it up to you.

118
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,625
Aw It's all water
under the bridge.

119
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,000
I would never've come
here if I didn't want to.

120
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,250
You weren't gonna feel any
better by being in this dump.

121
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,083
But, you came here
because of what I did,

122
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,583
not because you wanted to.

123
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,958
No, that's not true.

124
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,750
It's something else.

125
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,833
Holy cow, America's carbon
index is through the roof!

126
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:35,958
Come on, wake up sleepyhead!
You should be all over that!

127
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,291
Hey, look!
America is practically

128
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,250
begging for it right now!

129
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,958
Don't ignore me!

130
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,625
Hello?!

131
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:52,125
What in the heck? Jupiter?!

132
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:57,166
Quit daydreaming, would ya?!
Stick to this planet!

133
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,916
Sir, I've heard Kuniko Hojo
was taken into custody.

134
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,375
That's correct.

135
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,958
I request permission
to interrogate her, sir.

136
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,250
If you're trying to polish
your tarnished reputation,

137
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,375
this is not the time.
The case is

138
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:12,041
under the sole jurisdiction
of Atlas Corporation.

139
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,500
Yo prof! Are you
sure we're goin' in the

140
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,375
right direction over here?

141
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:31,000
Alright! Hang on Kuniko!
Help is on the way!

142
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,875
Nao! Hey, how have you been?

143
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,416
Oh-kay.

144
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,708
What's up?

145
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,500
So you're Kuniko?

146
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,166
Who wants to know?

147
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,250
Don't drop your tray!

148
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,333
Let go!

149
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,125
What's wrong with you?!

150
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,041
Stay the hell outta this!

151
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,375
What's the matter,
aren't ya hungry?

152
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:21,125
Go on. Stuff your
ugly face, bitch.

153
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,833
Hey you! What do
you think you're doing?

154
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,833
I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

155
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,541
What's her deal?

156
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,583
Alright ladies, welcome to
your first day of manual labor.

157
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,500
If we cut down some a
these big guys over here.

158
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,500
The idea is a buncha
new trees are gonna pop up

159
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,333
and swallow even more carbon.

160
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,875
It'll give ya somethin'
else to think about

161
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,125
besides what got ya here.

162
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,625
Uh, yes sir.

163
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:57,833
Good ol lumberjack duty.
Just like old times.

164
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,291
Now fall!

165
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,625
Oh crap!

166
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:08,916
Come on!

167
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,750
Way too close!

168
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,083
Yeah.

169
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,916
The hell's your problem?!

170
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,291
I called it out, dumbass!

171
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:31,416
You okay? C'mon.

172
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,916
Heads up! Fire in the hole!

173
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,791
Get down. Now!

174
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:50,875
What was that?

175
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,166
They fell more
trees with explosives.

176
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,833
Seriously?! But wouldn't
doing that put out

177
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,583
a whole buncha carbon
emissions in the air?

178
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,416
It's hydrogen.

179
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,291
No way.

180
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,625
Yeah, they use this compound

181
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,541
that needs a
catalyst added to it.

182
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,833
Once that happens, there's
a huge release of hydrogen gas.

183
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,250
There's no carbon
dioxide given off at all.

184
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,500
Just another way for Atlas to

185
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,541
make it seem
like they give a damn.

186
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,791
Hey.

187
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,958
It's not my fault
you didn't hear me.

188
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,375
But I did hear you.
You screamed at that tree

189
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,666
like you had a personal
vendetta 'gainst it.

190
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,250
Do you?

191
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,791
Mind your own damn business.

192
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,250
Now what's happening?

193
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,666
Hail storm's coming!

194
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,458
All inmates evacuate to
the Labor Center. Immediately!

195
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:46,708
C'mon, run!

196
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:47,708
We gotta get outta here!

197
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:48,625
Everyone inside now!

198
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,958
Hurry!

199
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,416
Nope! You're gonna
stay out there.

200
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,708
Try and stay dry.

201
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,500
Hey!

202
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,000
What are you doing?!

203
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:07,291
Why? D'ya feel like joining
her out there or something?

204
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,791
Kuniko.

205
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,500
Alright.

206
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:38,583
Whoa.

207
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,875
Ho-ly.

208
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,500
Damnit.

209
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,916
Oh please.

210
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:47,375
Such determination in her face.

211
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,333
Breaking her
will be a challenge.

212
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,666
Kuniko!

213
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,541
I'm so glad you're safe.

214
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,083
Hey, are you okay?

215
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,916
Yeah, I'm fine.

216
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,125
Those guards.
How can they just sit there

217
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,750
and watch without
even trying to help?

218
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,166
If you stop working,
you'll get in trouble!

219
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,833
Hey Nao.

220
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,875
Sorry I've been ignoring you.

221
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,583
I've just been scared. I
didn't want Rena to beat me up.

222
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,541
That's the name of that girl
that's been screwing with you.

223
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,833
After you left, she's pretty
much been top dog around here.

224
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,166
She's horrible.
Get on her shit list

225
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,458
and life'll be
Hell on Earth for you.

226
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,500
Ever since we got
this new warden, she's been--

227
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,083
What'd you say?

228
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,208
You were just runnin'
your mouth, weren't ya?

229
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,791
Back off.

230
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:04,000
Your problem's with me, so why
don't you leave her outta this.

231
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,458
Kuniko!

232
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,416
So you finally figured
out you're the problem?

233
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,333
Why me? Is the
warden making you do this?

234
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,250
Yep. Bust your
balls for a little while

235
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:20,291
and I walk outta the clink
a bona fide citizen of Atlas.

236
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,333
Some stupid rank is
that important to you?

237
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,875
Damn right it is!

238
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,375
You need one that bad?

239
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,958
The place I'm from got swallowed
up by those damn trees.

240
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,541
I got nowhere
else to call home now.

241
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,375
That's not true.
Live with us in Duomo.

242
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,750
Riveting.

243
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,083
Warden. I'm sorry.

244
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,791
You can do your penance
out here. Right where you are.

245
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,166
Three days without food
and water should suffice.

246
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:17,208
I'll do it.
I'll stay out here instead.

247
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,750
No.

248
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,458
Thanks but no thanks. You can
take your pity and shove it!

249
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,000
Making someone grovel
and do horrible things

250
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:28,458
while you wave an Atlas rank
in their face. It's just wrong!

251
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,500
As you wish.

252
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,208
Not gonna happen.

253
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:17,166
She doesn't deserve it. Why are
you taking the fall for her?

254
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,708
She deserves help
way more than punishment.

255
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,541
And this'll give
me time to think.

256
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,916
How long till she wears down?

257
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,458
For one so full
of life. Who knows?

258
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:45,208
You break our hearts and
still we lavish you with gifts.

259
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,791
So rebellious and so adored.

260
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,125
Who does she think she is?

261
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:03,375
So goddamned self-righteous.
She's nothing but a look-good.

262
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,833
Acting like some kind
of holier-than-thou martyr.

263
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,375
Ass-kissing whore.

264
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,500
You're dead!

265
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:20,375
Two years ago,
I stabbed a guy.

266
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,291
It was the dumbest
mistake I ever made.

267
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,875
I wish I hadn't
done it, but I was upset.

268
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,750
In that moment I
really and truly meant it.

269
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,166
I thought this guy
was the one, you know.

270
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:39,666
I loved him like crazy.
I was so naïve I let him...

271
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,208
Afterwards, he said
he was 'just messing around'.

272
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,750
We weren't serious.

273
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,666
He was just using me!

274
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,666
So what happened? Did he die?

275
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:54,625
No. He got outta town pretty
damn quick afterwards, though.

276
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:59,000
I don't know where he
ended up. Kinda glad I don't.

277
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:03,291
It was my fault! But Kuniko
took the fall for me anyway.

278
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:09,333
"It's okay." she said. "You're
hurting. I can handle it."

279
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:13,291
She went to jail for
two years for what I did.

280
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,958
I could never express
what that meant to me.

281
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:21,041
I couldn't let
her be here alone.

282
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,750
But I can never
make it up to her.

283
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,500
Kuniko Hojo.

284
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:49,708
It's been three days.
You've passed the test.

285
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:53,791
To reward your perseverance,
I will lift your burden.

286
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:06,166
I shall end your
troublesome life.

287
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,958
Her vibrant garb
now a death shroud.

288
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,958
Framed within a rifle's scope.

289
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,708
Lipstick that
once drew her face

290
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:53,958
in bloom falls pale
like scattered petals.

291
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:57,000
Next time: "Lipstick Cruelty"
