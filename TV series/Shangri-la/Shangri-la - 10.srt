1
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,875
Mercy. You'd think
we hadn't touched

2
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,958
this soil in weeks
with all the weeds.

3
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,125
I know. Seems like
Nature's taking back

4
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,916
her own more aggressively.

5
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,750
Oh, man. I just realized.

6
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,500
I know. It's weird.

7
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,791
This is the spot
where the slags hit us.

8
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:36,625
Why is this a
topic of conversation?!

9
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:40,625
Can the chit chat. There's
work to be done. Hop to!

10
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:44,416
But-- Sir, uh.
Shouldn't Kuniko be here?

11
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,375
Not much we can do 'bout it.

12
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,750
Yeah, I guess the pressure
of havin to spearhead this gig

13
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,666
is wearin on her, but
whaddaya expect of someone

14
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,208
who thumbed up her
nose at Nagiko's blade?

15
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,875
So is it official now or what?

16
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,833
Shut your traps!

17
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,375
That's our future leader
you lugs are flappin' about!

18
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,958
You think the old
gal's in the habit of

19
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:11,250
cherry pickin' heirs
who can't cut the mustard?!

20
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,583
Hey, I'm not makin'
any of this up here.

21
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,583
Listen! If you got any
kinda faith in the old girl,

22
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,333
then you got faith
in her granddaughter

23
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,500
to take up the reins!

24
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,916
But sir. She's not here!

25
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:46,291
Stop eating like
a sideshow act! Ugh.

26
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,541
For the love of Babs, it's
low enough you're reduced to

27
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,416
wearing a tracksuit in public!

28
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,916
Are you a tranny?

29
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,916
Trans-sex-ual.

30
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,500
Tran-sickle?

31
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,208
Whatever. Close enough.

32
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,333
Give me some room, hon.

33
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,833
Waste not want not!

34
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:17,708
Watch closely,
one show's all ya get!

35
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:25,166
That's so awesome!
What's it called?!

36
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,000
Such a lovely
time our frolic was--

37
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,083
That was Kuniko's boomerang.
There's no question.

38
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:49,500
Which can only mean one thing.
Momoko wasn't too far off.

39
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,041
Still, though,
I'm sure they're both fine.

40
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,166
Miiko? Miiko? Where'st thou?

41
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,083
Oh. Sorry, lamb.

42
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,416
Prithee tell us when we
may once more roam the surface.

43
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,041
I'm afraid Sayoko
would know better than I.

44
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,666
But we wish that it
were so at the moment!

45
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,791
Surely a brief visit
would incur no great disaster!

46
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,500
Not with our parasol.

47
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,583
Darling. You know the rules.

48
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:16,208
We would go there at our own
whim and under no power else!

49
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,500
Mind that temper.
You might very well have

50
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:24,833
lost your keepsake
just now. Here, be still.

51
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,208
Perfect. Like its wearer.

52
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:31,166
We thank thee much, Miiko.
By the by, might we yet--

53
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,875
Stop asking!

54
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,375
You're quite a catch.
Entertaining at least.

55
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,750
But this play-acting
is getting tiresome.

56
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,125
Mere rehearsal.
Untie me and I'll give you

57
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,916
box seats to opening night.

58
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,916
Thank you, but no. I much prefer
men in their unedited form.

59
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,708
Mind telling me why someone
like you was wearing this?

60
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:02,208
Hardly your style, I think.
Where did you get it?

61
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:06,375
I told you, an outlet
mall in Gotemba.

62
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,625
Perhaps your little
friends have a better memory.

63
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:10,958
My what?

64
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,375
The brats you were gallivanting
about with out there.

65
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,875
Best of luck.

66
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,166
You've got your work
cut out for you with that lot.

67
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,791
Not a problem.
I'm extremely diligent.

68
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:28,208
Oh! Look at you! Perhaps
I'm not so jaded after all.

69
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:34,416
I do believe we can
have all sorts of fun.

70
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:43,000
Just give it some time, sir.
You'll get your sea legs soon.

71
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,958
You're pretty good
with mimetic armor.

72
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,750
Why not just scare
up a yak-bag for yourself?

73
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,416
Shut up!

74
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,791
There you are.

75
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,416
Just so you know, the ground
where that smokestack collapsed

76
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,750
is now overrun with some new

77
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,041
fast-spreadin'
kind of vegetation.

78
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,250
Least, that's the
best Furukawa can figure.

79
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,500
Hey. The Hell's up with you?

80
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,083
You're blue. I get it. C'mon.

81
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,875
What good's it do ya
just to hang your damn head?

82
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,750
Listen. Every last
one of us's got

83
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,375
loved ones we
wanna raise from the--

84
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:27,708
Sorry. I'm not
sayin' Momoko's--

85
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,916
We don't know anything yet.

86
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,500
I'm gonna go. I need
something pickled.

87
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:44,791
Wait! Kuniko!
Me and my damn mouth.

88
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,125
I think it's time we
head back to your chambers,

89
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,000
don't you, love?

90
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:53,750
Miiko. Let us play hide and
seek! Thou canst be "it" first.

91
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,583
What? It's a
wee bit late for that.

92
00:07:56,666 --> 00:08:00,041
Thou must count to
one hundred! Prithee?

93
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:05,083
One round and we're going
straight in. One, two, three...

94
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:13,208
I want you to
tell me your name.

95
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,208
It's pointless to fight it.

96
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,833
Mo--Momoko.

97
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:24,291
Your real name. The one
given to you as a little boy.

98
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,083
Kenzaki.

99
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:30,333
Kenzaki Ryoma.

100
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,291
And your age?

101
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,291
Twenty-eight.

102
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,208
I'm no fool! I know
over forty when I see it,

103
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,416
so stop hedging. All right.

104
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,708
I'll start again from the top.
What is your actual name?

105
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:48,666
Natsuki. Masashi.
Twenty eight.

106
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,291
You lie!

107
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:59,708
Power of love,
sweetheart. Heady stuff.

108
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:05,541
Puts your "methods"
to shame. Ah. You know.

109
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:10,916
'course you do.
After all, you're a mother.

110
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,416
Those hips give you away.

111
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,958
I'd guess a girl? Around ten?

112
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,500
Shut your mouth!

113
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,916
You smoke.

114
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,750
Not in front of your daughter,
though. Am I right?

115
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,041
I said shut your mouth!

116
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:29,208
Tough isn't it?
Raising her alone.

117
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:34,083
You work day and night.
Trying to give her a good life.

118
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:37,375
It's not ideal.
She rarely sees you.

119
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:41,041
But you've no choice.
It's better this way.

120
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,500
Be little more
than a stranger to her,

121
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:48,291
than that she go without. Still,
you obsess over whether or not

122
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:52,583
she'll grow up twisted
by your absence. Poor thing.

123
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,291
Midori.

124
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:58,375
Pretty name.
Don't fret too much though,

125
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,833
'cause if she's like you,
she'll manage through the parade

126
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:05,833
of lonely nights more or less
intact. Well, she probably will.

127
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,750
Shut your goddamn mouth!

128
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:14,166
She loves her mommy.
Almost as much as you love her.

129
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,041
You're a whore!
You know nothing!

130
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:21,666
Lady Mikuni.
We cannot let you pass.

131
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,708
Yet we would leave.

132
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:24,958
Milady!

133
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:29,000
Tell us. How deep
doth thine loyalty fare?

134
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:33,541
How doth thou rate us?
Are we not most beautiful?

135
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,666
Whither must we turn
to quit this dreadful place?

136
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:48,833
Light Shield Deactivated.
Light Shield Deactivated.

137
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:55,458
Light Shield Deactivated.
Light Shield Deactivated.

138
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,041
Poppet! What have you done?!

139
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,416
Miiko. We hurt.

140
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,375
Raise the
goddamn shield back up!

141
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,333
Yes ma'am!

142
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,500
The light burns.

143
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,500
A voice! I hear a voice!

144
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:33,458
The Moon. The Sun. The Land!

145
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,541
It calls to them all!

146
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,541
The time is
upon us! The voice--

147
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:44,916
The Pillar of Heaven
must be obeyed!

148
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:51,583
Mikuni! Don't you do this!
Don't you die on me!

149
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,666
Poor, captive starling.

150
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,250
Far be it from me to
open the door of your cage.

151
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,791
Fantastic.

152
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,041
What's your drama?

153
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,708
Oh, only the
friggin' Atlas Corporation

154
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,375
getting wise to Medusa!

155
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,000
One of the ministers we
do business with must've sang.

156
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,958
No way! Why'd they do that?

157
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,333
Don't know,
but when I find out who,

158
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,250
they're gonna be a soprano.

159
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,458
Nevermind. I guess
there's still money to be made.

160
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,958
Let's just get on with it.

161
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,125
I have dinner
with the folks later.

162
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:26,000
What?! When in the
Hell did you make a typhoon?!

163
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,541
Good news.

164
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,666
Tarsian just restored the
old priority command settings.

165
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,083
You're top o' the
food chain again.

166
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,291
Huh? What's he playing at?

167
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,500
You're gonna look a
gift horse in the mouth?

168
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,375
C'mon, we can
get back to earning!

169
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,791
I--I can finally drag
myself out of the gutter

170
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:46,833
and buy clothes a
human being would wear! Ciao!

171
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:50,791
Hey! Klaris! Man.

172
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:55,166
A typhoon's developed
near the Marshall Islands.

173
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,125
Virtually stationary.
That's the odd thing.

174
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,583
It's hovering where it formed.

175
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,375
Possibly related to the
microwave pulse someone hacked

176
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,166
out of the Apollo satellite.

177
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,041
Someone has fashioned
themselves a shield.

178
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,166
We shall proceed regardless.

179
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,541
Ma'am.

180
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,041
Shogo?

181
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,208
Ma'am. Construction is now
twelve percent behind schedule.

182
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:20,166
And that percentage is
likely to increase with time.

183
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:25,083
No doubt the Prime Minister's
fault. Shion, darling?

184
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,583
Don't you pine
for the touch of

185
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,791
role play we
enjoyed in the prison?

186
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,791
Madam, 'twas marvelous.

187
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,250
Zet Vier.

188
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,208
Madam.

189
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,208
Round up the press core.

190
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,208
Consider it done, ma'am.

191
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,125
Bravo! I think
we have a winner!

192
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:02,916
It's not too revealing? Feels
like I might as well be nude.

193
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,166
Indiscretion is the
better part of pallor.

194
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,750
You expect me to
fight telepathically?

195
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:11,041
I expect a brilliant young
lady to be more resourceful.

196
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,708
Oh, so I guess the
boomerang's just for show?

197
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,791
A lady fights as a
last resort or not at all.

198
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,000
Oh, sure. And she shows leg.

199
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:25,208
Kuniko, please,
don't ever forget.

200
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,833
Be like the wind,
it's your life.

201
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,791
Can the greeting card crap!
No one's an island!

202
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,916
Look around you! We can't
all march to our own drum!

203
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,750
Oh, and that evidently means
we're not allowed a childhood?

204
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,875
That's not what
I'm saying. Look--!

205
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,500
Please, by all means clarify!

206
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,958
I know we live in a hard world.

207
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:52,583
It doesn't need our help.
Why feed it our children?

208
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:04,291
I'm not gonna cry,
Momoko. Not anymore.

209
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:08,291
I've made up my mind.
Things have changed.

210
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,791
I'm gonna make
you proud. I swear.

211
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,333
How is she?

212
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,500
She'll be fine.
Her condition is stable.

213
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,250
It's my fault. I should've
never taken my eye off you.

214
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,541
Thou art blameless.

215
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:29,708
We so cruelly tricked thee.
Canst thou ever forgive us?

216
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,125
Hush, my daffodil.

217
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,208
Milady, the fault is mine.

218
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:37,458
I move too slowly. You
languish whilst my research

219
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:42,166
creeps like jasmine.
I have failed you.

220
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,833
Still thy tongue.

221
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:47,375
Thou know'st we love thee
dearly not upon condition.

222
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,000
Your love humbles me, milady.

223
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:55,416
Just so. Though
may'st answer me this.

224
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,041
Wherefore the
voice in our head?

225
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,208
Do what?

226
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,125
We--We heard a
voice while falling down,

227
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,708
'twas like a wet
blanket laid 'cross our mind.

228
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:09,416
But I wasn't far from you and
heard not a whisper, my dear.

229
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,083
Then, only we were
privy to its timbre?

230
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:15,916
Milady! You must tell me
what the voice said to you!

231
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,208
"O Moon. Climb the sky. Dispel
the o'er arcing darkness."

232
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:26,041
"O Moon. Climb the sky?"
I know these words.

233
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,125
Please excuse me.

234
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,750
Sayoko?!

235
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:01,041
Breaking news. The Prime
Minister has stepped down,

236
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:04,458
citing emotional strain.
In Mister Umaimiya's stead,

237
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:09,000
Atlas Corporation CEO Ryoko
Naruse has assumed the role.

238
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,166
For more details, we go to
a press conference held earlier.

239
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,375
You're kidding me!

240
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,125
Unbelievable!

241
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,416
Looking ahead to the next
decade, my priority is Atlas,

242
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,083
and, of course, to move further
with the Greenification Project.

243
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,125
Is there a solution for
people living in the outlands?

244
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:28,833
Populace relocation
is also of great concern.

245
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,708
A review board has been
appointed to evaluate methods

246
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:34,125
which will help us
expedite the process.

247
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:37,416
Living arrangements and safety
are a concern, needless to say.

248
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,291
But above all else,
the people's quality of life

249
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,750
is this government's
raison d'etre.

250
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,208
What a joke.

251
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,541
Every word outta
her mouth's a lie.

252
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:50,500
So her name's Ryoko Naruse.

253
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,125
You may enter.

254
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,583
My sources at the
Moon Palace tell me that

255
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:08,625
Digma One has heard the litany.

256
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:12,833
Oh. I assume then
you know what's to be done?

257
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,541
Indeed.

258
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,625
What are you telling me?!

259
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,458
I repeat, ma'am,
the phrase satisfies

260
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,791
all analytic
parameters for a match.

261
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:26,083
Nevertheless, Lady Mikuni's
current ranking is unchanged.

262
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,666
You're to standby at the Moon
Palace until further notice.

263
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,708
Damn you! The
child heard Atlas' voice

264
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,750
as surely as
you're hearing mine!

265
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,083
How is that not a game changer?

266
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:38,083
Standby. That is all.

267
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:45,333
What chide'st thou?
Thy speed was frightful.

268
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,833
Milady, I--I swear
to you here and now.

269
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:52,500
You will feel the sun
upon your face without agony.

270
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,916
I was thinking it was
about time for you to show up.

271
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,000
I've been thinking
a lot about power.

272
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,375
Like what I might have
the power to actually change.

273
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:27,083
Thing is. The people
of Duomo are my family.

274
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:31,458
My life. If I don't take it upon
myself to improve their lives,

275
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:34,250
what's the point
of my being here?

276
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,750
Oh, child.

277
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,875
I've seen a lot of craziness.

278
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:41,541
And the more I see, the less
I feel able to do anything.

279
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:45,291
The less I feel
like we have a real shot.

280
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,625
There's a limit
to what any of us

281
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,125
can accomplish
on our own, Kuniko.

282
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:53,458
It's only natural you'd feel
it when confronted by Atlas.

283
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,458
You're right.
It's kinda overwhelming.

284
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,958
Listen, this isn't
about revenge.

285
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,541
For what they did to
Momoko or my friends in juvie.

286
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,708
I wanna make
sure you know that.

287
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,625
My mind was made up
before any of that happened.

288
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,708
It's just, I wasn't
sure I was right.

289
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,416
I mean, you know, for this.

290
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:22,958
Now I know, I will
be Metal Age's leader.

291
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,000
What'll be your
first triumph as president?

292
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,291
Storming Atlas.

293
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,333
I see.

294
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,333
There's no question
of your courage, my dear.

295
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,333
But you'll have to draw
on every screed of it.

296
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,625
Grandma--?!

297
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,041
I hear a voice.

298
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,000
"Oh Sun. Climb the sky.

299
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,916
Dispel the o'er
arcing darkness."

300
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,500
I'm hearin' things.

301
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:20,083
So this Medusa
or whatever you call it,

302
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,166
is hiding in
the Marshal Islands?

303
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,541
Precisely.

304
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,541
And you want us
to mobilize a task force?

305
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,250
Oh, no. It's already done.

306
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,958
The Yamato Takeru
is poised to strike.

307
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,291
Hold on! How did you
sneak an aircraft carrier

308
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,541
that size into their waters?

309
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,666
Well, sir, they are
called stealth carriers

310
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,833
for a reason, I believe.

311
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,208
Green light for
Phase Two, gentlemen.

312
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,708
Commence Operation Medusa
Clean Sweep on my order.

Sir. Lieutenant Kusanagi!

314
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,000
Right! Now dress her down.

315
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:57,208
Roger that! Removing camouflage.

316
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:48,166
Oh wow. I haven't
heard this song in years.

317
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:53,333
Not since it was sung especially
for me. Really takes me back.

318
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:57,291
Next time: "Butterfly Dream"
