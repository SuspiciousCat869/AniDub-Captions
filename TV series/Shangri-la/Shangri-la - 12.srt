1
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,500
How are we today?

2
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,041
Much better, thanks.

3
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,125
So, uh.
What's the outlook for

4
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,791
the navy guys I
was rescued with?

5
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,958
Oh, they're fine.
Fit as can be.

6
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:42,166
But I'd rather we
focused on your recovery.

7
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,958
Smear the cuticles. I dare you.

8
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:31,583
Madam. Arrangements for the
press conference have been made.

9
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,583
Very well then.

10
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:38,791
There were survivors from
Operation: Medusa Clean Sweep.

11
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,791
Sparing Digma Three,
neutralize them all.

12
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,208
As you wish, ma'am.

13
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,625
And he had the nerve to look
me in the eye and say "no."

14
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:01,250
Oh. Hey, look. Kuniko!

15
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,750
'scuse me for living.

16
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,041
Know what I think?
Now that she's president,

17
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,333
she's spread
herself way too thin.

18
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:13,375
Yeah. But with Momoko still
MIA you can't blame the girl

19
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,458
for wantin' to
throw herself into work.

20
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:16,958
I guess anything
that keeps her busy

21
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,958
is better than obsessing
on the worst case scenario.

22
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,791
S'pose so.

23
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:25,458
And of course, I've given
her plenty to worry about too.

24
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,416
What?

25
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,666
Uh-- Talking to myself.

26
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:36,500
Breaking Atlas news. Prime
Minister Naruse is about to

27
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:40,458
address the nation via an
impromptu press conference.

28
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,500
Greetings, my fellow citizens.

29
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,500
It is with a heavy heart that

30
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,916
I must announce the
relocation project's hiatus.

31
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,166
What the hell?!

32
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,791
I wish that it were not so.

33
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:56,125
But Atlas' construction
is too far behind schedule.

34
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,583
And therefore,
I'm afraid our priorities

35
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,958
must be temporarily shifted.

36
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,166
If the outliers must
wait a bit longer so that

37
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,875
the building
process can be expedited,

38
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:08,333
that is precisely what
I intend for them to do.

39
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,875
How do you justify
that decision, madam?

40
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,000
Why haven't we heard of this?

41
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,166
What about
your inaugural speech?

42
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,666
I am not here to answer you.
I'm here to inform the nation

43
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,875
that its acquiescence
is mandatory.

44
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,458
It's acquiescence
is mandatory?!

45
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,958
Oh, this stuck-up
bitch is going down!

46
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,750
It's time for us to
step outta the shadows

47
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,416
and take a damn stand!

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,250
So. What's your plan?

49
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,291
Take a look at this.

50
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,666
Uhhh?!

51
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,500
Wait. You want to
drop in on 'em from above?

52
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,916
Just random enough
to be effective.

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,750
Anyone who imagines
I just sit around

54
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,833
on a Tuffet all
day had best rethink it.

55
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:54,250
I meditated long and
hard on this, and boom.

56
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,875
Had myself a
flash of inspiration.

57
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,625
Anyway, as your leader
I take full responsibility

58
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,541
for the odds against
us on this one.

59
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,125
But when it comes right
down to it, I need your help.

60
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,708
Say n'more, chief.

61
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:10,375
If these are your
orders, we're on board.

62
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,666
It's up to you. 'Kay?

63
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,166
We'll need you to
work out the details.

64
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,041
What?!

65
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,791
Believe it, sweetheart. Get
New York in our sights pronto

66
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,541
and we'll be bathing in
cash. Check out the asset value

67
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:31,375
of the company I just bought.
A tenfold increase in seconds!

68
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,333
We can snatch up
America wholesale at this rate!

69
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,208
I wouldn't start popping
the champagne corks

70
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,416
just yet, Klaris.

71
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Medusa. Focus on China.

72
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,500
Zhang, the Chinese
markets are all yours.

73
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,083
On it and then some.

74
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,208
Sittin' on your
horde all cautious-like.

75
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,708
Just so you know,
you're a huge wussy.

76
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,208
Possibly.

77
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,625
Take a chance for once in
your life, like I'm about to do!

78
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,750
Don't let her get to you.
She's just worked up.

79
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,750
I'll get back
to you later, cool?

80
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,166
Been a while since
we made this much money.

81
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,083
"So why don't
you seem happier?"

82
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,458
Hey, I'm perfectly happy.

83
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,791
It's just, I could use a little
shopping spree to cheer me up.

84
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,666
"You mean you're
gonna go outside?"

85
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,791
I'm not crazy about
the idea. But, he... I mean--

86
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,708
Maybe I should do it
as kind of a thank you.

87
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,375
"What if a stranger tries
to make small talk with you?

88
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,333
Have you thought of that?" 

89
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,916
I haven't figured
out that part.

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,500
"So, what are you going to do?

91
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,208
Hey!

92
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,875
Hiya, Mr. Bear!

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,666
Ignore them. You're a
teddy bear. They can't hurt you.

94
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,916
Nicely done, Shion.

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,875
Madam.

96
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,166
Corporate Director
Nemoto is on the hotline.

97
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,500
Put him through.

98
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,875
Uh, Madam Ryoko.

99
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,041
At your service.

100
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:11,083
I--I have someone with me
here who is rather insistent

101
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,458
about speaking
to you immediately.

102
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,916
Who?

103
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,375
It's me.

104
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,541
Darling. To what do I
owe the unmitigated joy?

105
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,166
And may I say, the boyish look

106
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,666
is still working
quite well for you, dear.

107
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:31,083
Now, now. Life's far
too short to get huffy.

108
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,291
Come in. Please.

109
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,458
You've done well, sir.

110
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,500
We'll be using C4 to blast
through the divider walls,

111
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,333
so we'll need detonators.
And we're gonna want a mountain

112
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:27,125
of backup magazines if
we expect to hold out long.

113
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,125
I get it. Thank you.

114
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,750
What's up, ya pervs?

115
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,125
This is not a drill!
I repeat: this is not a drill!

116
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,625
Show me rage, Hercules!

117
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:39,833
They always like this?

118
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,416
So you geezers ain't
kicked the bucket yet?

119
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,250
Momoko not found.

120
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:50,000
Just us. Here to buy
some goodies from you guys.

121
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:54,083
Da da dada DA DAAAAA!!!!
All hail the Metal Age prez!

122
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,000
Wait. How'd you even know that?

123
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,625
Never underestimate the
otaku intelligence network.

124
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,416
Oh, hey. How'd your
grandma like the

125
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,958
Magical Gina figurine
we sent you home with?

126
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,583
Well, actually, she had what
you might call a conniption.

127
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,708
Ah! No!

128
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,333
Pierced through the heart.

129
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,291
I don't get it.
Why does that make you sad?

130
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:19,458
Whoa! Get a load of this!
An early model CZ Seventy Five!

131
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,916
When'd you get this bad boy?

132
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,666
Ah. A fellow after me own heart.

133
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,791
Oh man. You
old-timers got some

134
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,541
pretty neat
stuff hangin' around.

135
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,291
We didn't come here to browse.

136
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,541
We do, however, have a
rather hefty shopping list.

137
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,583
Take a gander at this.

138
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:42,791
Huh. Two hundred CK201s.
Two hundred .223 caliber rounds,

139
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,375
five-hundred hand grenades,
two-hundred rocket launchers.

140
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,958
No food rations listed, I note.

141
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,458
No. Not yet.

142
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:55,291
Ah. Might I suggest Type-II
rations? Great chicken stew.

143
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,500
Without carrots?

144
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,750
Uh.

145
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,541
Ah, get over yourself.
It ain't chicken stew

146
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,291
without the carrots.
Put us down for five hundred.

147
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,333
Excellent. Anything else?

148
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,708
Oh, yeah. Something vital.

149
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,875
Get me a kickass boomerang!

150
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:12,750
'Preciate it.

151
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,416
Thanks. See you next time.

152
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,791
Sure thing.

153
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,833
What are you looking at?

154
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:23,125
Uh. Nothing. Sorry. See ya!

155
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,125
Hey. Whatcha need?

156
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,000
Well. I'll take this.

157
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,916
And everything on the wall there
behind you, if you'd be so kind.

158
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,916
You deliver, I assume?

159
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,583
Yeah. I guess.

160
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,291
Right. So we're square?

161
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:41,000
Quite so. Seven days
and you'll have the caboodle.

162
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,875
Seven?! Make it three days
and we'll pay you double.

163
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:47,375
Whoa, whoa. Since when is Metal
Age runnin' a damn charity?

164
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,333
Since the start!

165
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,541
Well, because
it's you kids, sure.

166
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,291
May I ask where
the fire is, though?

167
00:10:56,375 --> 00:11:00,000
Ah, no fire.
We're taking Atlas by storm.

168
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,208
Huh?

169
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,625
Dah dah daaaahhhhhhhh.

170
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,083
Once we're in charge.

171
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,333
You guys are more than
welcome to set up shop there.

172
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,500
It'll be a helluva
lot cleaner than here.

173
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,375
And, you know,
it's kinda important that

174
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,375
our friends live well and all.

175
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,250
Awe!

176
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,625
Bye! See ya guys in three days!

177
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:24,541
That girl. No body
pillow could do her justice.

178
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:28,583
No lie. If anyone can pull of a
coup d'etat, it ought to be her.

179
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:32,208
Still. How many anime
boutiques they got in Atlas?

180
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:36,375
We're old. Our
place, boys, is here.

181
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,875
How long has it been, Sayoko?

182
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,708
Still collecting sycophants?

183
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:57,125
School girl habits
die hard, I see.

184
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,625
You're welcome to pick a
few for yourself, if you like.

185
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,083
No thank you.

186
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,458
You haven't changed
your tune a bit.

187
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:07,041
Still wrapping yourself
in shriveled androgyny.

188
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,041
Lady Mikuni has clearly
heard the litany of Atlas.

189
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:15,375
Why has she not yet been
named as the heir? Explain.

190
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,625
Who knows?

191
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,583
Don't toy with me! You have
an answer. I know you do!

192
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:24,125
Right as always. If only
your clearance was high enough

193
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,875
to warrant an
explanation. Then again...

194
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,291
Even if it were,
threats do not entice me.

195
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,375
A peon in your dilemma
should be kneeling prostrate

196
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,208
before the superior
they would entreat.

197
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,458
Bow and I might
just be persuaded

198
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,875
to overlook your status.

199
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,458
Too much for you?
Then you may leave.

200
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,791
I humbly ask of you...

201
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,125
Rather, I beg.

202
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:06,291
How pathetic. Even from
you I find such an utter lack

203
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,583
of dignity to be appalling.

204
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,750
A Triple A ranking is bestowed
upon all of Atlas' heirs,

205
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,125
but your Lady isn't
the only candidate.

206
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,541
There are currently three.

207
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,791
So it follows that

208
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,958
while Mikuni might have
indeed heard the litany,

209
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,958
she wouldn't automatically
be named as the heir.

210
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,916
Disappointing, I realize.

211
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,208
Nonsense! There
cannot be two others!

212
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:33,041
Oh dear. Methinks the
lady doth protest too much.

213
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,416
Does she?

214
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:45,375
This is actually a lot more
fun than I thought it would be.

215
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,875
I just wish I
didn't have to case

216
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,916
every single shop one at a time.

217
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,125
Hey! Best prices in town!
Get your coupons here!

218
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,625
Pardon me.

219
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,250
Could you tell me exactly
how much Akihabara costs?

220
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,791
And where'd I'd go to buy it?

221
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,416
Huh?!

222
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,375
Nicely done. I think that
covers just about everything.

223
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,375
Good, 'cause I've
got shopper's fatigue.

224
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,166
You're kidding me.

225
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,041
Hey, wait--

226
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,625
I'm dealing with idiots.

227
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,666
What is so difficult about
the concept of buying a city?

228
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,833
It's called real estate,
people! I didn't invent it!

229
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:31,416
Hey...

230
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,208
What?

231
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,583
Hey there.

232
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,250
You recognize me, don'tcha?
From that one time?

233
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,666
Oh god, it's the
meatspace manqué!

234
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,666
Right? Eh? Think back!

235
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,000
I've never seen you before--

236
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,375
Fibber!

237
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,375
I said I've never seen--!

238
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,500
Oh give it a rest,
you've gotta remember!

239
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:55,583
Nooo--! Don't look at me!!!

240
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,250
The Hell was that about?

241
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,000
I think we've
found you a new look.

242
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,791
I can't get it off!

243
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,333
No one stands in
Lady Mikuni's way.

244
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,041
If Ryoko won't tell me the
identity of the other two,

245
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,708
I'll find it.

246
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,041
Biometric ID.

247
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,416
I'll need one more
favor from you, friend.

248
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,791
Ah, Zeus.

249
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,333
Hope you're ready!

250
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,333
Madam.

251
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,750
What now?

252
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,750
I'm afraid someone is
attempting to hack into Zeus.

253
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:50,541
You can ignore them. They
have no hope of gaining entry.

254
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,041
Madam. The would-be
interloper's speed is

255
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,291
nothing short of astounding.

256
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,583
I've never
encountered its equal.

257
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,791
We estimate infiltration
at thirty million seconds.

258
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,166
Sayoko.

259
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,583
The little minx
is full of surprises.

260
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,916
Her hacking speed
is still on the increase.

261
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,125
She'll broach the top secret
area in twenty-three million.

262
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,708
Will she?

263
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,416
Is that all you've got?

264
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,708
I'm rather worried she's
managed to get this far.

265
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:39,625
Twenty thousand
seconds now. Ten thousand.

266
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,083
Ma'am, she's
approaching the threshold.

267
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,458
She'll give up before too long.

268
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,541
There you are!

269
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,375
Detrimental breech imminent!
She's at the threshold!

270
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,916
Files, if you please.

271
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,833
What the Hell?!

272
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:15,125
Bravo. A noble effort, darling.

273
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,041
Miiko? Hath Sayoko
not yet returned?

274
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:28,333
No, I'm afraid she hasn't. Not
surprising when one considers

275
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,333
that woman's
unwavering dedication to you.

276
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,083
Mayhap.

277
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,375
My Lady!

278
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,625
Oh dear!

279
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:48,000
Stay where you are.
She brought this upon herself.

280
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,333
Seditious actions
beget ends that none but

281
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,916
the most naive criminal
would dare complain of.

282
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,333
Pardon?!

283
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,541
Enough!

284
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,000
What shall we do?

285
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:19,916
This is Momoko's earring.
What in the world?

286
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,500
"So much for buying Akihabara." 

287
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,500
C'est la vie. Still though.
No place like home, I guess.

288
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:36,041
"Absolutely! At least here no
one tries to make conversation!"

289
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,833
The outside
world's so overrated.

290
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,166
"You really and
truly think so?"

291
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:58,291
"I mean, it was still
kind of fun, wasn't it?"

292
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:12,666
"I mean, it was still
kind of fun, wasn't it?"

293
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,833
Hello.

294
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,833
What's this?

295
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,416
You scamp.

296
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:30,458
Take care of yourself, Mo.
That's all I ask.

297
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,916
Miiko?

298
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,375
Is't thou troubled?

299
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,125
No, dear.

300
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,750
Miiko! Thou embraceth
us so fiercely!

301
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,291
We'll advance along
this route, and at this point

302
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,500
we're gonna rendezvous with the

303
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,333
other squadrons
that'll be moving in.

304
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,375
What are we hearing
from the internal branches?

305
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,083
They've all agreed
to help us out.

306
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,208
We'll marshal around the chosen
locale as you've instructed.

307
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,083
And from there, make our move.

308
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,875
Perfect.

309
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,750
There's one more thing, though.

310
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,708
The original plan
we had to rescue Momoko.

311
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,208
Forget it.

312
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,375
If we're not all on the same
page, we'll lose our focus.

313
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,333
We gotta put our efforts
into realizing the larger goal.

314
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,416
Besides, for all we know,

315
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,458
a rescue mission
could be pointless.

316
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,708
Our first priority
has got to be Atlas.

317
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,500
If Momoko were here,
she'd agree one-hundred percent.

318
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,750
Spoken like a leader.

319
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,708
Too bad more men
aren't so self-possessed.

320
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,833
Seriously, I'd date more.

321
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,375
Momoko. It's you.

322
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,083
Sweet pea.

323
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:49,291
Momoko! Momoko!

324
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh my. Someone's been at
the cookie jar, haven't they?

325
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:02,208
If they laid so much as a
finger on you... Are you okay?!

326
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,125
How the Hell'd
you get out of there?

327
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,750
Go easy on the
questions, darling.

328
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,291
It's been a
rather long few days.

329
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:14,458
I'm fine. Their flagship
S&amp;M cabaret left much

330
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:18,541
to be desired, sad to say.
The headliner was too butch.

331
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,916
Next time I think
about it, though,

332
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,125
I'll have to send
Miiko a thank-you card.

333
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,541
Miiko?

334
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:28,291
The one and only.
Seems she's in good hands.

335
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,333
I sense you've had a
somewhat dramatic change

336
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,458
of heart about Metal Age?

337
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,250
Yeah.

338
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:43,458
Be honest. Was it your decision?

339
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,666
Or did my absence
force your hand?

340
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,416
Oh believe me, the decision
was all mine. This is my life.

341
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,166
Ah. So you say.

342
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,458
So, are you,
like, against it, or...?

343
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,333
You know I've never
been one to tell the wind

344
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:03,083
which way I'd prefer it to
caper. I enjoy being surprised.

345
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,666
Yeah. So do I.

346
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,875
Honestly, I'm not
big on fighting.

347
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,750
But the people I
love need a protector,

348
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,791
and I'm the girl for the job.
So for our future's sake,

349
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:54,291
for the sake of the outliers,
from this moment forward

350
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,708
I'm a warrior!

351
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:57,791
Next time: "Flying Girl"
