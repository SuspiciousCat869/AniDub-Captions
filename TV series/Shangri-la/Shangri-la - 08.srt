1
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,708
Kuniko Hojo.

2
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:34,291
It's been three days.
You've passed the test.

3
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:38,625
To reward your perseverance,
I will lift your burden.

4
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:49,125
I shall end
your troublesome life.

5
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:07,250
Outstanding. There's the look.

6
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,458
If you lay a
finger on anyone else...

7
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:12,833
I swear to you,
they'll be the last person.

8
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:18,750
Does anyone here wish to
take umbrage with the sentence?

9
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:27,833
So we're all in accord as
to the fate of our firebrand?

10
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:29,416
Excellent. Heh.

11
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,541
Your update
on Digma Two, please.

12
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,416
Languishing in her cell, ma'am.

13
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,750
The child's éhlan for
stirring the pot would appear

14
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,666
to be spent.
At least for the time being.

15
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,083
Appropriately. She is condemned.

16
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,125
We have an alternate plan, then?

17
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,583
Nothing has altered.

18
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,916
If she's the sort to die,
she'd best get on with it.

19
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,250
You presume to serve me Rize?!

20
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,875
Is it not plain I want
Montagne Bleu san sugar?!

21
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,958
I am unworthy, madam.

22
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,208
Good work, fellas.
We're makin' progress.

23
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,625
Yes sir.

24
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,416
Huh?! Son of a bitch!

25
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,416
We got a shit-storm!

26
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,583
The bastards
have slapped her with

27
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,208
an outright order of execution!

28
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,458
What?!

29
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,666
They were just
talking about it on the news.

30
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,791
Duomo's 'bout ready to pop!

31
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,750
But wouldn't they have needed
to formally sentence her first?

32
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:23,333
Ya think those Atlas thugs give
a shit about legal procedures?

33
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,000
Then we ought to
pickle some celery.

34
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,416
The girl eats 'em
like they're going extinct.

35
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,708
And some turnips, too, I think.

36
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,250
You know what?
Let me handle this one.

37
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,583
Jumping the
proverbial gun, as men do.

38
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,625
So. We jump when?

39
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,458
That's really
not for us to decide.

40
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,541
I suppose not.

41
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,166
They say
Kuniko's on death row.

42
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,416
Oh, how awful!

43
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,833
Surely this country's
not so far gone as that.

44
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,791
Keep it together, soldier!

45
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,125
How the hell else did
you expect her to end up?

46
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:10,541
She's a damn terrorist,
not a close personal friend!

47
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,583
In other news, Metal Age
ringleader Kuniko Hojo

48
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,541
has been sentenced
to death for her crimes

49
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,375
against the
Japanese government.

50
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,791
Enough already. We get it.

51
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,208
"Slow news day I guess." 

52
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,708
Does the media really think
anyone's biting their nails

53
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:34,000
over what Big Brother does with
a bunch of dirt-faced savages?

54
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,166
Mommy?

55
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:43,500
Who the heck keeps leaking my
email address out to spammers?!

56
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,083
If I needed someone
to play match-maker,

57
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,875
I'd have put myself out there.

58
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,125
Well, your company
just buried itself,

59
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,333
because I'm gonna set
your network infrastructure up

60
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,583
on a hot date
with my friend, Medusa.

61
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,083
How long do you
intend to let the same

62
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:02,125
big red spot
mesmerize you? Idiot.

63
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,708
A matchmaker service?
Like I'm lonely.

64
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,250
You've got a visitor.

65
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,583
Momo!

66
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,208
You're a difficult
woman to see.

67
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,958
Are you getting enough to eat?

68
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,583
'Cause I gotta say,
your little girls there

69
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,208
are telling me you're starved.

70
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,750
Maybe "the girls"
and I have gone on a diet!

71
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,458
Hell-bent on
cutting a lithe figure

72
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,166
before the
firing squad, are we?

73
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,500
Maybe, yeah. Make you sad?

74
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,875
Oh beside myself, hon.
Look at my mascara.

75
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,583
I'm an absolute wreck.

76
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,916
That thing, there. She's the
circus act who kicked up

77
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,166
such a stink over Digma Two's
arrest, if I'm not mistaken.

78
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,541
Indeed.

79
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,375
Doesn't she seem complacent
under the circumstances?

80
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,750
Well, perhaps if we're lucky,

81
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,958
she's tried baking a
crowbar into a sympathy cake.

82
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:22,666
Tell me. What would you do
if I were the one... you know?

83
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,541
Being executed?
That's a cheery thought.

84
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,541
Honestly, if I couldn't
keep it from happening

85
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,375
I don't think
I'd forgive myself.

86
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,375
So you'd just stumble
through a dreary half-life?

87
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,500
Sweetheart. Think about it.

88
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,125
How would that be
a credit to either of us?

89
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,250
You'd just be using
my death to keep yourself

90
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,916
at arm's length
from everyone else.

91
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,333
Yeah, well...

92
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,791
Safe to say I'll never
have to deal with your death.

93
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,166
Thanks for
turning it homeward, love.

94
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,000
Lucky for us, I have a plan.
Once you're in the ground,

95
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:54,291
I'll show the devil a little
leg and presto, back you'd come!

96
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,083
Let's just hope you're his type.

97
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,250
Bite your tongue!
Of course I am!

98
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,000
Who do you think put the
money up for Tropical Fish?

99
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,791
Silly me.

100
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:06,333
Oh, that's right. A little
short-timer care package.

101
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,708
Huh?

102
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,416
"A gown for
the gallows." Nice.

103
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,291
And it's hideous.

104
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:20,583
Even a drag queen wouldn't
wear this. Wow, lipstick, great.

105
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,375
I guess it's the thought.

106
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,000
Now that's
what I'm talkin' about!

107
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,833
Way to lump fugly
and the fulsome together

108
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:32,041
in the same package,
guys. Well, still though...

109
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,083
At least you
got one thing right.

110
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,958
Oh man. This just got real.

111
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,708
Sorted garbage is green
garbage. You girls got that?

112
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,291
Yes sir!

113
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,791
Hell yeah!
Scrap of nano-material!

114
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,458
Complete and total score!

115
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,625
Don't stand there
and advertise it, dumbass!

116
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,750
Just fish out
as much as you can.

117
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,916
Alright. That's all you get.

118
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,125
Baby, that's all I need.

119
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,500
Don't skimp me.

120
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,291
Yeah, yeah.
Three minutes. That's it.

121
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,416
Hold it!

122
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,375
Who the hell
said you could be here?

123
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,708
Uh.

124
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,041
Last I checked, this place
was off limits for inmates.

125
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,666
Listen, please.
I have to talk to her.

126
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:07,250
Come on. What kind of
letch do you take me for?

127
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,833
Kuniko!

128
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,083
What're you doing here?!

129
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,583
I just had to see you.

130
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,375
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you'll be in?

131
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,708
It's okay. I've got
the guards in my pocket.

132
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,541
Tomoka. You can
manage without me, right?

133
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,083
After I'm gone?

134
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,916
Don't talk like that, okay?

135
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,250
Sorry.

136
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,833
Listen-- I'm getting you out.

137
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,333
Don't you talk like that!

138
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,458
I swear on my life,
if you're cooking something up!

139
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,916
Relax. No one else is around.

140
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,666
I've got it all figured out.

141
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,375
No. I'm not
letting you put yourself

142
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,083
in danger for my sake.

143
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,916
Look, if you're worried
about me slowing you down,

144
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,958
I promise I won't.

145
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:00,166
I can't. I'm sorry.

146
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,208
Kuniko!

147
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,083
Hey. Talk to me.

148
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,750
Tomoka.

149
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,708
Someone's coming.
I'll come back.

150
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,541
Be careful.

151
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,666
I think we'll
just keep that between

152
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,916
the two of us for the moment.

153
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,291
Go.

154
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,333
You surprise me.

155
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,916
Soichiro!

156
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,625
That was your chance to
motivate Digma Two right there.

157
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:43,958
If it'd had been me I'd have

158
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,250
sluiced her brains
through the cell door window.

159
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,083
I didn't think the
idea was to pitch the girl

160
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:52,458
into a homicidal frenzy 'less
you want to handle the fallout.

161
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,791
We'll just keep that between
the two of us for the moment.

162
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,125
Oh that does it!
I'm gonna kick your ass!

163
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,333
Yeah. You and what army,

164
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,083
ya skinny little piece of shit!

165
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,416
You wanna wait
for Kuniko in Hell?!

166
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,041
Bitch! Think I'm
scared of you?!

167
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:16,875
Break it up and report outside
for clearing duty immediately!

168
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,750
Alright, ten minutes.
So make 'em count!

169
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,250
'bout time. Oh man.

170
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,666
Uh-Uh. Piss off.

171
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,916
Hey, I don't got my own.

172
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,291
Fine. At least
wait till I'm done.

173
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,291
'scuse me, sir?

174
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,625
I wanted to "pick some
flowers". Is that okay?

175
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,458
Sure. Go crazy.

176
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,541
Whatcha need the tea pot for?

177
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,958
Well. I'm pretty sure the trees
don't want my scent on 'em.

178
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:57,041
Yeah, okay, thank you.
Just don't take long.

179
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,625
I don't know about this.

180
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,125
Whatcha think she's gonna do?

181
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,583
S'not like the
girl'd survive out there

182
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,541
long enough to get away.

183
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,375
Guess this spot'll have to do.
You guys bring the stuff?

184
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,166
Bet your ass we did.

185
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,791
Alright. Let's do this.

186
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,250
You really think this
setup's gonna do the trick?

187
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,000
Hey, if I've learned anything
valuable in this playpen

188
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,291
it's how to
improvise some alcohol.

189
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,666
I know one dumb
bitch who's gonna be

190
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,958
in for a real nasty surprise.

191
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:42,000
Just try not to blow
yourself up. So help me though,

192
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,833
if you tell anyone where you got
it from, you'll wish you had...

193
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,666
Sure. Whatever.

194
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:53,166
Whatever my ass. Try settin'
it off without a catalyst.

195
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,208
Everybody's gotta
get inside immediately.

196
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,375
We got another
hail storm on the way!

197
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,375
Another one. Intense.

198
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,083
Wonder what's goin' on at home.

199
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,250
C'mon! Any slower
and we might as well

200
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,500
be carvin' out a god-damn tomb!

201
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:51,291
I expect this place to be
immaculate by execution day.

202
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:55,833
I've been meaning to ask.
Why that day in particular?

203
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,500
Bit of a red letter
day in her horoscope.

204
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,750
In Mikuni's as well.

205
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,541
There. Now it's
your turn to pick.

206
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,291
Hmmm. We fancy this one.

207
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,166
Excellent--

208
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,458
Lady Mikuni.

209
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,875
I bring good news milady,
today thy person may

210
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,166
venture to the
surface for a time.

211
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,416
Forsooth?! Hath a physic
been unearthed to make it so?

212
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,250
No. That goal
remains unreached.

213
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,166
Then 'tis put a poultice.

214
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,125
Oh, 'tis but a pity.

215
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,000
To dwell abroad
o' nights coddled

216
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,583
in the selfsame penumbra.

217
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,666
Not the selfsame.

218
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,583
But rather one
whose vast circumference

219
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,750
generously bid thee
caper where thou wilt.

220
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:45,875
Hold on, girlie!

221
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,500
We'll bust ya outta
that hellhole in no time!

222
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,458
It's that time, huh?

223
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,750
'kay. Let's get this
over with quickly, then.

224
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,625
Mind if I doll myself up?

225
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,250
Not if you don't
mind my mirror, no.

226
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,500
Much obliged.

227
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,708
Not a bad blade.

228
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,375
I notice you're
not wearing the outfit.

229
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,375
Oh, from the care package?

230
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,958
Not exactly the dress
I want to be caught dead in.

231
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,666
No blindfold?

232
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,500
I'd rather face the
end with eyes wide open.

233
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,041
Too bad they
don't need any help!

234
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,583
I'd have given my
left eye to play you off!

235
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,458
Present arms!

236
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,250
Soldiers ready!

237
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,583
Fire!

238
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,375
What did you just do?!

239
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,333
Nano-wire!

240
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,500
And adding insult to injury,

241
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,583
I'm not even sure
I'm using it right!

242
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,041
Don't think you'll
get out of here alive--

243
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,208
Restrain her!

244
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,375
Heads up!

245
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,791
I owe ya one! Hurry up!

246
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,125
Coming!

247
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,375
Goodbye, everyone!

248
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:01,083
I'll come back for all
of you as soon as I can!

249
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,375
You're damn right you will!

250
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,166
Good luck, Kuniko!

251
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,416
More like
good luck to you guys!

252
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:11,625
No! You imbecile,
you'll ignite the hydrogen!

253
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:12,916
Do what?!

254
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,500
Leave it to you to work
out something this elaborate.

255
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,958
You'd be surprised what a little
self-reflection dredges up.

256
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,166
Uh. Don't pat me on
the back just yet, though.

257
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,458
We're gonna stop a bit short.

258
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,291
Bingo! Mountain road!

259
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:51,750
Huh?!

260
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,041
Come on!

261
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,333
Ten point landing

262
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,125
Thanks a lot, Kuniko.

263
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,583
And thank you for
getting the two of us this far.

264
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,166
You're late!

265
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,125
What are you doing here?

266
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:23,625
Flawless intuition.
Welcome back.

267
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:30,500
Good to be back.
You scrummy Harlot!

268
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,583
Look at you.
Kicking ass and taking names!

269
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,916
Lay it on, girlfriend.

270
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,375
So? I guess the little goodie
bag came in useful after all?

271
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,333
No condemned soul
should be without one!

272
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,208
Took a while to
figure out the nano-wire.

273
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,041
But I'm pretty
sure I did alright.

274
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,583
You just treat it
like a you would a man,

275
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,708
nice and gentle, but firm.

276
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,166
You puzzled your way through
the carbon thread, I take it.

277
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,208
Ah, that. I knew
the dress had to be good

278
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,458
for something, and
it sure wasn't fashion.

279
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,458
Pretty clever
of ya, I gotta admit.

280
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,833
What are you talking about?

281
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,791
It was super ugly,
but the material in it

282
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,625
is what wound up
holding the balloon together.

283
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,416
It's unbelievably
tensile stuff.

284
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,166
The other girls used it to
sew various scraps of fabric.

285
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,791
Once they had your
basic hot-air balloon shape,

286
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,166
they buried it out in
the yard during clean-up duty.

287
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,833
Where'd you
dig up the hydrogen?

288
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,583
It was from the charges they use
to clear out the old forests.

289
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,625
Not too hard to come by when
the guards are all men, ya know?

290
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:28,208
And the alcohol catalyst?
Where did that come from?

291
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,416
It's clear they
distilled it from something.

292
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,708
We just don't know
what quite yet, madam.

293
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,583
Clever shrews.

294
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,458
A worthy spectacle
all around, I'd say.

295
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,625
Sufficient pretext for our
schlepping home, at least.

296
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,250
Shogo will be relieved.

297
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,541
And what of
the inmates, madam?

298
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,875
Not a damn one
of ya s'got the grapes!

299
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,833
Live as one, die as one!

300
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:57,041
Zet Vier, call the
tramps on their bluff.

301
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,333
Yes ma'am.
Commence operation lullaby.

302
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,666
Something wrong?

303
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:18,083
No, I guess it
was just my imagination.

304
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,791
Mine, too, in that case.

305
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,666
Clue me in here?

306
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,625
No birdsong.

307
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,500
Normally they're so loud
out here it's almost deafening,

308
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,875
but right now
they're not making a peep.

309
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,416
An eclipse!

310
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,000
'kay, that's weird.

311
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,541
Explains why our
feathered friends are sotto.

312
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:43,916
Mo, look!

313
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,833
Funny. I don't recall dropping
'shrooms on the way here.

314
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,666
♪ Girls and boys
rush out to play. ♪

315
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,333
♪ The moon doth
shine as bright as day. ♪

316
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:05,500
♪ Leave your supper,
leave your sleep. ♪

317
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,708
♪ Join thy friends

318
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,875
What the Hell?

319
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,083
Sweet pea.

320
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,458

to toughen that hide, is it?

00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:51,208
You'll always feel too deeply.
But that's as it should be.

322
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:54,375
The world doesn't have much use
for a heart that can't break.

323
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:57,708
