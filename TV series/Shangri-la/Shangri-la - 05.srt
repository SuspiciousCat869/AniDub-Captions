1
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:28,166
Oh great. It's Polka Dots!

2
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,375
Polka dots?

3
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:30,666
Aha!

4
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,833
Idiot!

5
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:40,208
Ah. Strawberry undies
today, it would seem.

6
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,166
Damn, girl.

7
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,125
Hey! Hands off, creep!

8
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,875
March home right this instant!

9
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:58,416
What?! Are you on something?

10
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,875
Listen, I'll let
you walk this time,

11
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,500
but don't try
and press your luck!

12
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:04,250
Back off, boy scout! There is
no call for you to cop that--

13
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,541
Ya hear me?

14
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,500
Get out of here or
I'm calling this in. Period.

15
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:08,833
If you think I'm
threatened by that,

16
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:11,625
you're in for a
strong cup o' coffee!

17
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:14,375
That jerk,
what the Hell's his beef?

18
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,750
That's the little drummer boy
from Ikebukuro, am I right?

19
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:20,666
Oooh. The prezzie of
your fan club, perhaps?

20
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,375
The guy's not here for me!

21
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,333
Question is,
though, why would a slag

22
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:27,083
be trolling around a shady berg
like this in the first place?

23
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:30,416
While rather unsuccessfully
swathed in geek chic.

24
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,333
It just doesn't add up.
Something here reeks.

25
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:35,125
Nothing for it, sweets.

26
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:38,041
That means we'll
have to follow our noses.

27
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,541
Should I even bother asking?

28
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,000
Tadaa!

29
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:29,375
Feast your peepers on the finest
in VR-Based Cyber Surveillance!

30
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:33,833
The damn-near unshakable
4D Sim-a-tron Five-Thousand!

31
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,666
Keep it in your pants.

32
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,583
Allow me. This device
translates information

33
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,541
within a
remotely targeted PC

34
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:44,833
into nerve impulses experienced
directly by the user!

35
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:47,291
Momo. You get any of that?

36
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,208
Only the part about impulse.

37
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:53,250
All personnel to battle
stations! Start the engines!

38
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:57,083
Starting engines, sir!
Output on the rise!

39
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:01,708
Synchronization: Go!
Stabilization: Go!

40
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,791
Auxiliary Power: Go!

41
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,583
All hands prepare to initiate

42
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,541
Hojo Mark One
launch sequence now!

43
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,916
Well this is kinda surreal.

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,375
Uh. Hojo Mark One
launch complete.

45
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,375
Alright then.

46
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,750
So I just walk around, I guess?

47
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,708
Get the lead out!
I don't have all day!

48
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,916
Someone else coming
in to join the party?

49
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,291
What the Hell is this?

50
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,125
That's my design, thank you!

51
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,208
On your toes! Hostile
forces looming to starboard!

52
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,500
Fire at will!

53
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:17,625
Sure, I'll get right
on it. Oh, naturally.

54
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,250
What the-?

55
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:46,916
Yasuda Six-Sixty Nano CPU.
Specialty piece that one.

56
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,750
I'm sure you
know their circulation

57
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,541
is heavily restricted.

58
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,291
Word is the best place
to come by one is here.

59
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,500
My friend and I would like
to know who else is looking.

60
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,958
You the cops?
Naw. Military, right?

61
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,625
I don't keep a ledger.
Well, not a hard copy.

62
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,041
Gotta guard your
reputation in this racket.

63
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,375
You could always
torture me, though.

64
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,666
That's not exactly
how we do things.

65
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,583
How you feel 'bout Atlas?

66
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,916
We're in a position to
offer you full citizenship.

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,333
And if I just happen to be

68
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,416
perfectly content
with where I am?

69
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,000
Bring it out.

70
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:37,291
Holy crap! No way!

71
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:46,041
Nice work!
Goddamn. Mimetic armor?

72
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:49,125
I thought that was
just a crazy theory!

73
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,750
Set it loose in the field and
all your military wet dreams

74
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,500
come crashing into reality. Huh?

75
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:57,625
We're talkin' a
whole new paradigm of war!

76
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,625
If the army came after
us suited up in that stuff.

77
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,000
We'd all be sitting ducks!

78
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:06,000
Just give us a name
and it's yours to keep.

79
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:13,375
Orochi. An American
leasing company.

80
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,250
"Orochi?"

81
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,750
"Why would they need
that kind of processing power?

82
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,625
I mean, assuming they
think they could do it

83
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,291
under the radar to begin with,
it's not like they've got

84
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:28,208
the brains to craft a system
capable of rivaling Medusa."

85
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,666
Hello?

86
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,500
Sorry, uh...

87
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,166
Okay, what just happened?!

88
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,416
That was the girl I couldn't
dredge up any info on.

89
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,666
It had to have been! Great.

90
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,916
She's lollygagging around in
my virtual reality stream now.

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,208
Waltzing over big as you please,
trying to make conversation!

92
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,458
Decidedly not cool!

93
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:14,000
Okay, Karin.
Calm down and think.

94
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,291
I'll bet the
little meat-space manqué

95
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,083
was sniffing around
for the Yasuda CPU.

96
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,625
"What else would she be up to?
The slags are all over it.

97
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,333
But what's our next move?"

98
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,333
Hey, what gives?

99
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,916
This is just a sample.

100
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,375
When your squeal checks out,

101
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,708
we'll send you a bona
fide large-scale prototype.

102
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,041
We've got our own
reputations to think about.

103
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,500
A little girl?!
She wasn't one of ours!

104
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,000
We'd never design
an avatar like that!

105
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,000
Look, I know
what I saw in there!

106
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,791
Well, okay, she might've
been a teddy bear at first.

107
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,541
Maybe, like this tall.

108
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,166
Point is she transformed into a
little girl right under my nose.

109
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,291
She's a child star!

110
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,708
I told you those days
are long behind me!

111
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,208
Seems kind of obvious.

112
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,500
Someone else besides you
was in there puttering about.

113
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:10,125
To be honest, I'm feelin'
kind of out of my depth here.

114
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,291
Why don't you run ahead
and start filing the report?

115
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:17,208
There's some stuff I
need to do. Can I trust you

116
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,291
to deliver the contents of that
backpack to your squad leader?

117
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,791
Sir!

118
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:28,333
We love not Sayoko's absence,
Let us away to her side at once!

119
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,916
Patience,
Mikuni darling. Patience.

120
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,458
I can't say I know
where she's gone off to.

121
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,791
But I will hazard a guess

122
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:38,125
she's out there somewhere
working on your behalf.

123
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,666
Quite so. She toils so we
may have our freedom, yes.

124
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,500
Then we'd best not
hinder her efforts.

125
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,750
There's my goody girl.

126
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,625
Thou must further regale us with
stories of the Lower Realms.

127
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,166
Not had your fill?

128
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,708
Let loveliness dazzle us anew.

129
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,666
Alright. And which
tale would dazzle you most?

130
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,750
Describe to us the water
that from the ceiling doth fall.

131
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,250
That's called rain.

132
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,791
And it falls from the
sky dear, not the ceiling.

133
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,041
We knew that!

134
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,208
We have also heard
tell it makes a curtain,

135
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,500
drenching all entangled.

136
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:16,500
Oh, honey!

137
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,625
At its worst it
can soak a dandy's

138
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,666
toughest poly-blend
clean through.

139
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,250
Ah! And when the hailstones
start thwackin' down. Bam!

140
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,541
Pray there's cover nearby

141
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,250
if you don't want
your skull ventilated!

142
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,791
How enthralling!
Is it truly thus?

143
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,291
Well, if you find
that enthralling,

144
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,875
you'd have positively
swooned to see

145
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,166
the holes on the roof
of our old club, then.

146
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,250
You speak of the
Tropical Fish, yes?

147
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,208
Yeah. A flood washed
away our sign once.

148
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,125
Had us all in panic.
Momoko was so--

149
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,541
The club's
proprietress, correct?

150
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:50,333
Man, oh man. Those were
some rough days for us.

151
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:57,458
This world that you evoke,
would that we could glimpse it.

152
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:01,333
Nay, that we could
meander there at will.

153
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:12,708
Farewell, dear heart.
I won't soon forget your charm.

154
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:16,000
The latest test subject
is ready when you are, ma'am.

155
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,875
No! Damn you! Let me go!

156
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,791
That's right. Don't be shy.

157
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,291
Shriek as loud as you wish.

158
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,333
No one within earshot
gives the slightest damn.

159
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,666
Wha--What are
you gonna do to me?!

160
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:38,625
Someone help me! Please,
I just want to go home!

161
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:42,583
Look, whatever you want,
I'll do it, I swear!

162
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:46,666
That a fact?
Then tell me I'm naughty.

163
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:51,791
Yes! Hurl insults!
Spit in my face!

164
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,041
Come on, love.
Say, I'm a whore!

165
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,708
It's been awhile.

166
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,500
"You just thought
of something clever."

167
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,083
Thanks Mo. I owe you one.

168
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:30,500
Oh, honey! I know
fate when I see it!

169
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,083
Huh?!

170
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,750
Darling young
lovebirds-in-training

171
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:37,083
don't dovetail by accident twice
in the same day under the eaves

172
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,833
of a sprawling shanty town
like Akihabara, believe you me!

173
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,458
Easy there, matchmaker.

174
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,000
Don't spoil the mood.

175
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:47,083
Let nature run its intended
course. Take flight, chickadees!

176
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,083
Ya know, if you wanna leave,
I won't be insulted.

177
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,000
Same goes for me.

178
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,916
I'm staying right here.

179
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,708
Ice breaker. You're
from Atlas, aren't you?

180
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,250
I am. So what of it?

181
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,916
So, give me the
goods on what it's like!

182
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,333
Do your people really get
to nom on whatever they want?

183
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,041
What about those big houses?
You all live in one?

184
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,333
And what's the
deal with the roads?

185
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,166
Whoa, whoa!
Hold on! You've been?

186
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,666
Uh. You could say that.

187
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,750
Oh, no. So the one behind the
break in at the plant was you?

188
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,875
No one broke in anywhere!

189
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,625
We had to halt construction
'cause of that little stunt!

190
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,833
Look, believe me.
That wasn't my intention.

191
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:31,416
I just--I just wanted to get a
quick peek at Atlas for myself,

192
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,708
that was all! And now
that I've seen its size,

193
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,958
I'm wondering why
it's so exclusive!

194
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,500
We're moving people
in as fast as we can.

195
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:43,041
Oh, sure, the "lottery."
Try relocating en masse!

196
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,041
That would be chaos!
Give it time.

197
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,208
Everything has to
be done on a schedule.

198
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:51,750
And the past fifty years
hasn't been enough of a window?

199
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,166
It might've been if some
people hadn't messed it up!

200
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,541
Oh yeah?

201
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:57,750
Stand there and tell me

202
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,708
with a straight face
terrorists have helped.

203
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:03,916
You kill trees. Steal property.
Burn whatever you feel like.

204
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,500
What do you think
that's doing for the move?

205
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,333
Look, I'm--I'm not...

206
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,500
You know, there's a scary
good chance Tokyo will be

207
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,916
underwater within our
lifetime. The forest canopy?

208
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,375
Our last best hope?

209
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,333
Completely wiped out in
the next couple of years.

210
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:22,291
Conservation is
vital, as is Atlas!

211
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,000
Was it vital for
the government to lie

212
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,708
about the quote-unquote
acreage tradeoff?!

213
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,083
The land they've
said we destroyed

214
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,500
was supposed to be ours!

215
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,583
Is that what the
Metal Age propaganda machine

216
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,208
uses to grasp at straws?!

217
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,833
I'm not part of it,
so I wouldn't know!

218
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:40,333
Yeah? Then why do I see
you with them all the time?!

219
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,416
Well, I--

220
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,875
Hail storm! Take cover!

221
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:11,000
I can't remember the last time
I've seen it come down so hard.

222
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,708
Someone up there
has it in for you.

223
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh, ha-ha.

224
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,083
I'll have you
know they call me

225
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,166
Sunshine Boy
back at the barracks.

226
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,333
Hang on. Those glasses
are new aren't they?

227
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,875
It's just a disguise.

228
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,458
Personally, I think
they're wasted on me.

229
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:28,458
Looks like there's a bridge
within scurrying distance.

230
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,125
Run for it?

231
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,541
In here!

232
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,416
Wow. You really
know how to sprint.

233
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,541
They do train us for
this kind of thing, so...

234
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,833
Must be nice.

235
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,333
Sounds like what
you call training,

236
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,458
most of us call survival.

237
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,083
People living in
the shadow of Atlas

238
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,500
pretty much do
this every single day.

239
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,291
I sympathize with the
outliers' plight, you know.

240
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,125
Losin' lotsa sleep over it?

241
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,375
I'm tryin' to get
square here, okay?

242
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:10,791
You folks're why I joined
the army in the first place!

243
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,916
This place is freezing.
I wonder...

244
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,125
Emissions galore.

245
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,958
We have to keep warm.

246
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,500
But doubling back to
our previous conversation.

247
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,583
Tell me everything
you know about Atlas.

248
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,666
Like, start with the really
swank house you get to live in.

249
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,875
It's not that nice, really. I
mean, where I live is decent,

250
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,041
but we're not all rich
like you think we are.

251
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,583
Ah, but the
cuisine! Is it fab?

252
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,083
Some of it's good.
Some of it not so much.

253
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,708
Well yeah. But what's
your all-time fav?

254
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:54,583
Oh, my fave?
Chicken stew, I guess.

255
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,041
Bleck! With carrots,
no thank you.

256
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,750
More for me.

257
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,833
So are you happy?

258
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,791
Is living there
everything you want it to be?

259
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,125
You sure ask a lotta
questions. I've got one.

260
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:13,583
It's been on my mind ever since
I ran into you in the jungle.

261
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,000
What is it?

262
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:19,291
What's all this business
about "white pearls?"

263
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,416
Hey, don't just laugh at me!

264
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,708
Oh. Sorry. No, seriously.
You're asking the wrong girl.

265
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,791
I have no idea,
and Momoko won't say.

266
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,208
Of course.

267
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:35,333
How 'bout whichever of
us finds out first tells all.

268
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:39,666
Oh! Speaking of which, actually.
The name is Kuniko Hojo.

269
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,833
Oh. Right. Call me Kunihito.

270
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,291
You're just full
of surprises, aren't you?

271
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,458
What?

272
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,625
Sorry, nothing.

273
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:58,333
Someday, Atlas will
house the whole country.

274
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,916
It may be hard to
believe now, but you'll see.

275
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,500
Once the construction's done.

276
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,375
Till then, it's up
to every last one of us

277
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,833
to protect it with our lives.

278
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,708
When is someday?

279
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,041
How many more decades?

280
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,291
How long do the outliers
have to fend for themselves

281
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,166
till the government gets a move
on?! How many more restrictions

282
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,125
are they gonna put us
under in the meantime?!

283
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,541
Typical. You think
your suffering's

284
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,250
the only one that counts.

285
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,208
There's plenty of
crap we have to deal with!

286
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,375
Bigoted slag!

287
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,958
You guys suffer, too? Sure!

288
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,291
Ivory towers are a pain
in the ass to keep clean!

289
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,833
Right? Huh?

290
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,916
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

291
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,500
Life on the ground is
awesome. Every day's a party.

292
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:50,500
Yeah. Five families per house
with barely anything to eat.

293
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,041
I was making a point! Sorry!

294
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,250
You were making a point?! Oh!

295
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,708
Walk a mile in our shoes!
Then try making your point!

296
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,500
Hold it right there!

297
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,958
Damn it!

298
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,250
Sweetie?

299
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:28,500
Fabulous. So the date
went well? Whatcha got there?

300
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:34,041
Sorry, Mo. I, uh. Sort of
might have lost my boomerang.

301
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,958
Real shrewd career move.

302
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,666
Military was there.
Out casing the dregs.

303
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,250
Apparently they were trying
to pin down some fancy CPU.

304
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,166
Interesting.

305
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,833
And you'll be happy
to know that I walked away

306
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,458
with a pretty spiffy
consolation prize.

307
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,375
Have yourself a little lookie.

308
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,791
What the Hell'd I just see?!

309
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,041
A very sophisticated
piece of military tech

310
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,083
in all its razzle-dazzle.

311
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,125
The unit's surface can
realign it's carbon molecules.

312
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,916
And it can imitate
just about anything.

313
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,625
Put it with rock,
and it's rock.

314
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,458
Put it with sand,
and it's sand.

315
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,291
Basically, it blends in
wherever you want it to.

316
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,500
At least as far as we can tell.

317
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,958
How near are they to
using it in the field?

318
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:41,416
Wish I could tell ya. All I
know is that this is a sample.

319
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,416
You're joshin' me. How're
we supposed to fight this?

320
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,500
Oh well. At least,
it won't surprise us.

321
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:54,041
Thank you, Kuniko. This is
quite useful. Good work.

322
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,750
S'cool. Oh! Something else.

323
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,500
I brought you back
a personal souvenir.

324
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,708
Okay. What in the--?

325
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,000
Meet Magical Gina.

326
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,750
Apparently she's all
the rage over in Akihabara.

327
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:16,458
Hello there everybody! My name's
Gina! Pleased to meet you!

328
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,666
The freak-o's
at the shop said

329
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,916
you'd especially
get a kick outta her.

330
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,291
Are you having
an old person fit?

331
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,916
Take it away!
I can't stand that thing!

332
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:31,125
Don't you dare! Let one
smartass comment slip,

333
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:34,208
four eyes, and I'll make
you as sorry as I am.

334
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,291
Seriously? What's up?

335
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:39,666
Oh, come on! Grandma,
you're killin' me!

336
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,125
You have a cabinet
meeting tomorrow,

337
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,958
followed by
the plant inspection.

338
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:48,083
After that-- What the-?!

339
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,458
Ishida Finance, I presume?

340
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:56,083
"Sorry for calling so late,
Minister. Is this a bad time?"

341
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,458
Is no place sacred?

342
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:02,125
"When you ignore my calls I'm
left with no alternative, sir."

343
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:05,125
However many times
you ask me, wherever,

344
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,333
this government has
no interest in what you--

345
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:11,833
"Orochi." That's the
dragon on our gold.

346
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,833
Dear Mom and Dad,

347
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:48,291
Things are going good here,
all things considered.

348
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:51,875
Which I guess is really just
a way of saying things suck.

349
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:53,291
With the way the
world is run right now,

350
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,416
it's hard to
tell which way is up.

351
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,791
Next time:
"Fictitious Battle Lines"
