1
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,833
Furnace 3 is down!
Fall back to Okubo Street!

2
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:37,708
Ya think we should run?

3
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:40,625
A lady should never
entertain an unwelcome suitor.

4
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:42,958
Who the Hell is firing?

5
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,083
Don't know.
It's not our forces!

6
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,625
Why aren't we
launching a counterattack?

7
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,333
Engaging a force
of unknown origin

8
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:51,625
and strength is not a
strategically sound idea.

9
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,750
What strategy
would you recommend?

10
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,666
A complete withdrawal.

11
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,041
My incident notes will indicate

12
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:01,166
we fell back upon
your recommendation.

13
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,791
Furnace 2 is down!
Cut the supply--

14
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,791
What's the damage?

15
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,375
I don't know what's goin'
on in the rest of the city,

16
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,250
but we've lost furnaces
two and three for now!

17
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,625
Run!

18
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,166
You all right?!

19
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,125
Yeah, we're fine.
But we need ta--

20
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:09,458
Of course we'll go check
on the others. Come on!

21
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:10,666
Right!

22
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,208
That blade of yours.

23
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,541
I assure you I have all
the credentials to carry it.

24
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,916
It's been in my family
for generations, sir.

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,791
The tone it made rang
from elsewhere as well.

26
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:29,083
I heard it too, but I couldn't
tell where it came from.

27
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,708
Please, you have to keep moving!

28
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,875
Are you okay?

29
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,708
Yeah! Thank you so much!

30
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,625
Yoshihiro!

31
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,416
Mom!

32
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,041
You and those
Metal Age goons want to

33
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,500
take on the government, huh?

34
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,333
This is our home too, you know!

35
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,208
Don't be mean to her.
She was helping me!

36
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,250
We don't need her help!

37
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,750
Soichiro.

38
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,958
The attack originated
in old Ikebukuro,

39
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,291
and considering the target
selection and precision,

40
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,083
all signs point
to it being the work

41
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,958
of a highly
trained artillery unit.

42
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,791
A new guerilla faction
entering the fray perhaps?

43
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,958
Their skill belies a
force far more capable.

44
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,083
Are you implying
foreign troops have launched

45
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,166
an assault from
within our borders?

46
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,875
Although similar activity
has been reported elsewhere,

47
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,750
sending artillery
without other support

48
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,083
is illogical,
strategically speaking.

49
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,291
I understand.

50
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,333
Shion?

51
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,208
Yes, my lady?

52
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,791
You have a
youthful point of view.

53
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,833
Do you think we should
allow alien forces

54
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,208
to enter our country
without striking back?

55
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,958
N-No, no ma'am.

56
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,208
Violence shall be
met with violence!

57
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,583
Will age weaken
your resolve as well?

58
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,750
My lady!

59
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,041
I'll lead a recon mission
into the poison swamp at once.

60
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:27,041
Just please let him down.

61
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,000
That sounds lovely.

62
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,333
Shogo, I shall
trust the rest to you.

63
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,875
Of course.

64
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:44,583
Shion, I'm so sorry,
please tell me you're okay!

65
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:49,416
Forgive me, brother.
I've disappointed you again.

66
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,000
That's not the kind of attention
you want to garner from her.

67
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:55,000
Speaking out freely like
that can cost you your tongue.

68
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:59,166
I won't apologize for what I've
done. I had no other choice.

69
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,958
It looks pretty bad,
but I heard a lot less people

70
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,541
got hurt than they thought.
That's good, I guess.

71
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,625
Yeah... right.

72
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,333
Have you seen Kuniko around?

73
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,500
I'm pretty sure
she's been stuck

74
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,000
doing some Metal Age
thing all morning.

75
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,416
Huh, I thought she
said wasn't with them.

76
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,083
Yeah, she says that,
but you know her grandma.

77
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,875
You got a point.

78
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,291
So the attack came
from the Ikebukuro forest?

79
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,875
We got verification
on that, Furukawa?

80
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,375
Do you think someone could use

81
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,083
the old subway
tunnels to get there?

82
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,000
They probably could, but--
No way, kid!

83
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,250
Now don't you
go entertaining

84
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,458
any fantasies of
derring-do young lady.

85
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,500
The air in that swamp
is not only poisonous,

86
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,791
but'll make quick work of
that lovely complexion a girl

87
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:58,791
like myself would kill for.
Besides, this is not your fight.

88
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:03,500
But that's not true. 'Cause,
Duomo is home to all of us.

89
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,083
Anyway, I'm sure we have
some suits or something

90
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,541
we could wear
lying around. Right?

91
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,166
Fine, you win.
Well, Mister Tailor.

92
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,000
We're gonna need a 36-24-35
for bust, waist and hips.

93
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,958
Not for her, you moron!
Those are my measurements!

94
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:27,666
Do we need to get you a new
pair of glasses while we're out?

95
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,666
You're really coming with me?

96
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,125
I bet you give this
place another year or two

97
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:39,833
and the goddamn roots'll be
choking' up the entire tunnel.

98
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,875
Why did I even bother giving
that blind twit my measurements?

99
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,166
Change your hair
color and you could

100
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,500
prob'ly pass for
Miko in that thing.

101
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,458
My worst fears realized!
Surely we can go back.

102
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,791
Not a chance.

103
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,541
This is an emergency.
I can't go out like this!

104
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,458
Sweet Raquel,
if I ever get this size,

105
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,750
please, fit me for a coffin!

106
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,750
You have my word.

107
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,458
Nicely done Karin!

108
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,791
Looks like Medusa's
making a big splash!

109
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,208
If you're handing out kudos,

110
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,208
don't forget who netted
all that capital from the EU!

111
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,708
Since we're patting
our own backs,

112
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,166
I'll be sure to mention
my silver tongue was the one

113
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,083
who brought Ishida
Finance all the gold

114
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,958
from the Swiss Carbon
Banking Federation.

115
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:21,041
Yeah, yeah, I think we can agree
that we're all pretty awesome.

116
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,750
But, what's most awesome to me

117
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,375
is that we're all
rolling in dough.

118
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:28,291
Speaking of rolling, I forgot to
tell you guys, I bought Ferrari!

119
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,500
Cool! You pick up
the new 706 or something?

120
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,250
No silly, the whole company!

121
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,083
So how's Medusa?

122
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,208
Help me.

123
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,666
Looks fine to me.

124
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,250
The poor thing...

125
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,375
Being in constant fear of death
is no way to spend your life.

126
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,666
That's how it's gotta be.

127
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,291
That "poor" thing's
what's keeping us

128
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,708
outta the "poor house."

129
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,708
Well put, but I
still question the wisdom

130
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,333
of keeping Ishida HQ
on the Marshall Islands.

131
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,666
Those levees break
and it's all washed away.

132
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,958
The islands are a tax haven
and Medusa is just a program,

133
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:03,416
ya big softie. Besides,
you gotta love the realism.

134
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,708
Medusa has to control
those nasty carbon emissions

135
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,041
to keep from drowning.

136
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,000
I know it's "just a
program" but you gotta

137
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,583
empathize with
the little bugger.

138
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,333
I've known him since
he was just a line of code

139
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,000
and he's been so good to us.

140
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,416
Damn right!

141
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,375
Anyway, Karin, you got a
new target in the crosshairs?

142
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:23,958
Dunno. Let's see
what catches his eye.

143
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:32,541
Help me! Help me!
Help me! Help me!

144
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,500
Aww. Don't worry. This sea
you're in is the carbon market.

145
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,916
All you gotta do

146
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,833
is find something out
there that looks out of place.

147
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,166
Those are weak spots
that you can break into.

148
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,791
I know you can do it, you're the
best in the whole world at that.

149
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,208
Weak spots. Weak spots.

150
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,833
There's always one or two.

151
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,916
Just look for a place
with a lot of carbon emissions

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,666
and not enough carbon credits.

153
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,333
It's like a big gap that
you can slide right into.

154
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:02,500
I found one!
I found one! I found one!

155
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,125
Nydamia, huh? Alright,
let's do it guys!

156
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,625
Ooh! Me! I'm right on it!

157
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,833
I found one! I found one!

158
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,250
Very good!

159
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,208
Now wait while Auntie Klaris
gets our contract ready.

160
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,250
All done!

161
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,666
Zhang!

162
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,583
Relax, we just
bought up a huge chunk

163
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,125
of their industrial sector.

164
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,166
Now to sell it
off for a fat profit!

165
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,208
Not to mention collect
our fee for getting rid of

166
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,583
all that yucky
monetized carbon!

167
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,875
Look at those
investors rollin' in!

168
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,875
You ready to sell off?

169
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,208
No, not yet.
Not 'til it hits peak.

170
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:55,500
Money is a girl's best friend!

171
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,583
Uh, Karin.

172
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,083
Yes! Yes!

173
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,791
Sell it all now!

174
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:11,375
Big sale on assets!
Everything must go!

175
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,208
Oh yeah!

176
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,750
Oooh, that got me soo hot!

177
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,291
I gotta spend
some of that cash!

178
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,958
I think that's
enough magic for today.

179
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,250
Ooh, this one looks good!

180
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,833
Tarsian, you know you're
being rude! Speak up!

181
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,375
Come on, let's play some--

182
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,250
Such a heavenly tone did
sing out. Do we know why?

183
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,583
A pertinent question, milady,
and one I posed to Atlas.

184
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:29,875
They answer not.

185
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,750
Miss Mikuni.

186
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,000
Surely that
splendid chime portends

187
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,833
glorious days
to come for you.

188
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,916
Light will shine down and fill
your heart with resounding joy.

189
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,291
Your careless tongue
betrays your lack

190
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,958
of experience in this chamber.

191
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,375
What could be the matter?

192
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,500
My heart spoke
and I simply desired

193
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,708
to share its joyous
words with my lady.

194
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,875
Tis a pity.
My prayers are with you.

195
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,750
What do you mean?

196
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,583
Your lies are sweet,
but poison to our soul.

197
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,208
That makes the fifth such
one to fall this month alone.

198
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,208
We shall begin the search
for her replacement

199
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,833
with all possible dispatch.

200
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,583
No matter. The lower
realms brim with servants

201
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,791
ripe for the taking.
Is that not so?

202
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,833
Everybody make sure your
breathing apparatus is working.

203
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,208
I just felt a pop in
my ears, is that normal?

204
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,750
The pressure in the suit keeps
the outside air from coming in

205
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,083
and popping your lungs
so that's good thing.

206
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,875
Now. Let's all check our
secondary filters, alright?

207
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,666
If your suit rips, that little
thing will save your life.

208
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,708
But it's only got enough juice
for an hour, so be careful.

209
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,333
Remember our
objective is strictly to

210
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,625
locate the enemy's artillery
squad, not to engage them.

211
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,125
Let's move.

212
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,875
Well, from the sound of it,

213
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,916
there's water
everywhere around us.

214
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,208
We must be right under a lake,
so let's keep moving ahead

215
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,625
and see if we can find a way up.

216
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,250
Be careful you guys,
'cause if you fall in

217
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,291
that toxic soup down there,
that's the end of it.

218
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,458
You'd be dead 'fore we could
even think of saving you.

219
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,750
According to Foorukawa's guess.

220
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,833
We're just about
to the launch site.

221
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,458
Look up ahead!

222
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,958
Our search is finding no
trace of enemy activity.

223
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,500
How come the slags're here too?

224
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,541
Looks like recon to me.

225
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,875
If the army's out here
runnin' recon like we are,

226
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:47,125
I guess that means it
wasn't them that attacked us.

227
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,708
A shrewd deduction.

228
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,833
I don't believe it. A man behind
me, and I didn't even notice.

229
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,041
You guys could stand to learn

230
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,250
a thing or two
about stealth tactics.

231
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,875
Metal Age not
trained ya that far?

232
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,750
I am partially untrained.
But fully transsexual!

233
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,625
This suit ruins my
figure and my aim.

234
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,458
Takehiko!

235
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,750
Kuniko, you guys okay?

236
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,083
Yeah, we're both fine
and making our escape!

237
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,666
Get back to the station,
but don't get tailed, copy?

238
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,333
Loud and clear!

239
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,000
Momoko, don't fall behind!

240
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,500
I'm trying sweetie!

241
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,583
I thought all that Judo would
be great for your stamina.

242
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,958
It is, but have you
ever seen a Judo match

243
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,625
take place during a marathon?

244
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,000
You always said
you were poised to be

245
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,125
"the crown jewel of
the Olympic team," right?

246
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,583
I gave up my
jewels a long time ago.

247
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,833
That lovely surgeon
took them as his trophy!

248
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,291
Oh, now I get it.

249
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,375
You know. They say
a tranny simply trades

250
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,833
his jewels for
gorgeous white pearls.

251
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,375
What the Hell does that mean?!

252
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,625
No time for that dear.

253
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,583
Let's focus on
our escape right now.

254
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,416
Come on, don't be such a tease!

255
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,333
What do you mean by pearls?

256
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,875
I'm actually
kinda curious myself!

257
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,375
Geez, it's so freakin'
hard to move in this thing!

258
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,750
You'd move a lot faster if you
weren't babbling about jewelry.

259
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,208
Yoo-hoo!

260
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,875
Don't bother.
Lemme ask you something.

261
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,416
Why the Hell is the slag
heap poking around out here?

262
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,833
Although I may be your prisoner,

263
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,125
I don't have to answer
any of your questions!

264
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,583
Why did my grandma's dagger

265
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,666
and yours both make
that sound earlier?

266
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,166
You mean there's
another dagger like mine?

267
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,666
You know something, don't you?

268
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,250
All I know is I'm not talking!

269
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,708
You got the kinda balls
we like in Metal Age,

270
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,541
so if you quit the army,
come on out to Duomo.

271
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,708
Sign up with us. I'll put
in a good word for ya!

272
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,000
What am I gonna do with you.

273
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,875
Stunts like that go
against the survival instinct.

274
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:35,333
There's no way I could've
done that in this clunky suit.

275
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,333
We need to run along home now,

276
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,666
that nasty swamp air

277
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,333
is gonna melt your cute
little face right off.

278
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,541
Don't try to
scare me like that.

279
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,625
Who was it?

280
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:57,416
It was polka dots. I mean, some
Metal Age soldiers out there.

281
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,375
Digma 2 again was it?

282
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,708
What?

283
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,000
Then they don't know any
more about it than we do.

284
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,375
You didn't recover any shell
casings, or any other evidence

285
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,000
of a militarized
force out there?

286
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,916
That's correct sir,
we couldn't find a single trace

287
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,833
of an enemy installation.

288
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,875
An unknown force
wielding an unknown weapon,

289
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,375
amid inhospitable conditions.

290
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,583
What do you mean?

291
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,416
Exactly what I said.
I checked with

292
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,500
our carbon surveillance
satellite, Icarus,

293
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,833
and it detected no unusual
carbon dioxide in Ikebukuro.

294
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,833
A battery of
artillery fire, but no CO2?

295
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,000
So what do you suppose
could be behind this?

296
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,083
You're our top analyst,
so I'm sure you have

297
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,458
some kind of
theory in the works.

298
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:44,291
Perhaps the forest
is baring its fangs, eh?

299
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,666
None? You didn't find any
metal at the points of impact?!

300
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,083
What the hell?!

301
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,666
We got nailed, and you can't
find a single shell fragment!

302
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,041
That's so weird.

303
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,875
Yeah. Well, I think it's
those bastards at Atlas

304
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,666
testing out some secret
weapon on our people!

305
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,208
Would they do that?

306
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,458
They're gonna
announce the results

307
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,333
of the Atlas lottery right now!

308
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,833
This time I'm goin'
to Atlas for sure!

309
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,500
It's my lucky day!

310
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,375
Give me a break.
Don't you idiots realize

311
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,916
this Atlas lottery bullshit
is just some great big

312
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,208
government scheme
to try to buy our--

313
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,375
Guess not.

314
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,625
It won't be us.

315
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,083
You must never forget
the tranny code, dearie.

316
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,916
Confidence is the
lipstick of our spirit!

317
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,041
I can't help it, I'm sorry.

318
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:45,958
It's our destiny to enter
Atlas and re-open Tropical Fish.

319
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,291
The city simply needs us there.

320
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,708
I know, but what about Kuniko?

321
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,083
If Atlas chooses us,

322
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,416
you know we can't take
the little scamp with us.

323
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,041
We'll have to leave her behind.

324
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:02,125
And our lucky winner is...

325
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,416
Congratulations,
Mr. Tetsuo Kumagai.

326
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,583
It's not fair.
Why you and not me?

327
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,208
I come bringing
news that will surely be

328
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,250
of great interest
to the Head of Atlas!

329
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:13,166
We've heard the sacred
chime of the amulets.

330
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:48,250
An incomplete utopian
world, born of man's desire.

331
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,708
While the meek and pure of
heart are called to enter,

332
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:53,166
the uninvited
make their own way.

333
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,833
Next time: "The Creation"
