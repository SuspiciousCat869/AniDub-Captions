1
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,208
That's the survey bridge...

2
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:51,250
Jose! Look!

3
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,166
It's odd that there's
no security over here.

4
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,083
Where did you station Pinocchio?

5
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:47,541
Up above, so he can
keep an eye on the land.

6
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,750
How much longer?

7
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:57,583
We need about 15 more minutes
to set all of the charges.

8
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,666
There's the security!

9
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,291
Franco... Let's take the
boat and get outta here!

10
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,583
We're not done.

11
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,625
They'll be on top
of us any minute!

12
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,833
Besides... With what
we've planted...

13
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,208
it might be enough
to destroy it!

14
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,375
Jose, come in...
I've found the enemy.

15
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,500
I'll be right there, Henrietta!
Just slow them down!

16
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,833
Right.

17
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,833
Stay on the ground!

18
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,583
We're getting out of here!

19
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,166
No!

20
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,333
Henrietta!

21
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,333
I'm here, Jose.

22
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,375
C'mon, we gotta move!

23
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,166
Will you be alright?
How's your gunshot wound?

24
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,416
It's better...

25
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,833
Now that the painkillers
have started kicking in.

26
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:01,333
I'm sorry... I'm sorry, Franco.

27
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,750
Nah...

28
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,666
It's all because I
hesitated to take a shot.

29
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,000
When did you hesitate?

30
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,875
The first time I ever
killed someone...

31
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,083
There was this girl

32
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:19,208
who was in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

33
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,333
I killed her.

34
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,416
It might sound weird, but
pointing a gun at a little girl

35
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,958
is something that
really scares me.

36
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,666
If I'm ever going to get
stronger, I can't be like this.

37
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,500
The bullet's still in there.

38
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,875
I'll be fine until morning.
Just leave it.

39
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:35,083
I made a call and got
a doctor from Rome coming.

40
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,916
I guess the thing
didn't collapse...

41
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,333
Guess not...

42
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:51,750
What do you think's going
to happen to Cristiano?

43
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,458
If the elders still
haven't decided

44
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,041
what kind of a move
their going to make...

45
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,666
He might actually have a chance.

46
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,125
I hate to say this...

47
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:10,375
we're gonna have
to tell Pinocchio.

48
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,583
You're right... We have to.

49
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,083
How you doing this morning?

50
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,416
Oh, I'm doing alright, Domenico.

51
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,791
Up early. So you're
finally heading out then?

52
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:52,875
Yeah.

53
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,333
You better be
back before autumn.

54
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,458
That's the harvest season.
I'll need you.

55
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,875
You can count on me.

56
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,583
Well, Pinocchio's gone.

57
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,333
Yeah...

58
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,500
Are you sad about that?

59
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,041
You know, I kinda am.

60
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:48,166
Recently you two had started
to talk like normal people...

61
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,250
I feel bad for you.

62
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,208
Triela.

63
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,125
We need to be going.

64
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,708
Yes, sir.

65
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:44,208
Word is this Pinocchio guy
is Cristiano's confidant.

66
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,708
I bet we'll find him again.

67
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,583
I sure hope we do.

68
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,375
You can fight all you want
when the time comes...

69
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:01,125
but you know... dying will
never solve anything.

70
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,791
Yes, sir... Hilshire.

71
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:39,666
Sorry to interrupt.

72
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,541
What is it?

73
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,708
Pinocchio is here and
would like to see you.

74
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,958
He's here right now?

75
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,791
Pinocchio, why did
you come here?

76
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,166
Uncle!

77
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,583
I don't remember calling
for you. You need to leave.

78
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,791
I won't leave.
I came here to help you!

79
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:11,750
What made you think...
that I even need your help?

80
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,541
Flanca said you're in trouble...

81
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,083
Is it true the police
are coming after you?!

82
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,958
You only damaged
the survey bridge.

83
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,750
It's too early to
tell what will happen.

84
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:25,958
Isn't there someplace you
can hide out for a while?!

85
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,583
I've lost too many men
these past months...

86
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,333
More than I ever have before.

87
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:40,791
If someone takes responsibility
for our failures, it will be me.

88
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,041
You can't be serious!

89
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,875
If the cops show up, you're
just gonna let them arrest you?!

90
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,708
That's crazy!

91
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,916
I've been thinking about
what to do with you...

92
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,125
What do I do with you
when the time comes?

93
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,791
I don't want to
leave you, Uncle!

94
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,916
I'm gonna stand
by you and fight.

95
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,666
No, you will not...

96
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,583
You have to leave
this place right now.

97
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,708
I'm not leaving!

98
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,875
Why is it that you
choose not to listen?

99
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,625
Because I love you, Uncle!

100
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,125
You saved my life.

101
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:42,833
I'll always be
indebted to you for that.

102
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,583
You helped me get out
of that basement room

103
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,208
and gave me a name!

104
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,625
It was just a whim!
It meant nothing to me.

105
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:52,000
I saved you on a whim...

106
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,791
Why else do you think
I gave you that name?

107
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:58,583
No real parent gives
their kid a name like yours.

108
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,625
If you choose to
stay in this place...

109
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:12,250
Then I'll kill every
person who comes inside.

110
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,541
Cristiano's mansion is on this
mountainside, right here.

111
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,750
There are two access roads.
This one and this one.

112
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,458
Not too far down the east
road is a gas station...

113
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,041
That's their lookout...

114
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,208
Hilshire and I will neutralize
it and continue to the mansion.

115
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:42,333
Marco, I want you to take the
west route and block the road.

116
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,000
Hilshire's fratello
and my fratello

117
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,375
will make the first
breach on the mansion.

118
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,666
Our objective is to
capture Cristiano

119
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,916
and neutralize anyone else.

120
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,583
I can't believe you're here...

121
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:54,791
It's been a long time

122
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,500
since we've had a job
together, Angelica.

123
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,375
Let's do our best.

124
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:04,375
I just wanna make sure that I'm
as useful to Marco as I can be.

125
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,375
Angelica you ready?

126
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,208
Yes, I'm ready when you are.

127
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,666
Then go set up the Steyr
on the roof of the car.

128
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,375
I'll get on it now.

129
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,083
Hey, Angelica!

130
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,000
Yes...? Do you need something?

131
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:41,208
No, I was just curious...
How you feelin?

132
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,500
Great!

133
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,916
Good...

134
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:49,375
Priscilla?

135
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,250
Yeah?

136
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:53,000
Hurry up with those barricades.

137
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,291
I'm almost done.

138
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:09,250
It seems as if Pinocchio
refuses to leave us.

139
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,500
I never sent the
kid to school...

140
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:18,958
The only thing I knew to do
was raise him as a killer.

141
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:23,000
Still... he said he loves me.

142
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:26,416
What a very nice thing to say.

143
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,041
I don't understand it...

144
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,458
How could he...

145
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,916
How could he not hate me

146
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,125
for what I've done to
him these 10 years?

147
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,791
He has his own unique reason.

148
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:41,166
As does anyone when
they love another.

149
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,333
And, if you'll excuse
me for saying, sir...

150
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,666
I have sensed your own
unique brand of love

151
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,875
for him over time, as well.

152
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:55,166
I'm sure I was not the only one.

153
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,250
You wanted more than
anything in the world

154
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,125
to treat him as your own son,

155
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,166
but no matter how
hard you tried,

156
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,375
you simply never knew how to
go about doing it. That's all.

157
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,708
What he said is true.

158
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:26,916
I believe he won't leave this
place unless I flee first.

159
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,875
Alessio.

160
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,041
Yes, sir?

161
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,416
Ready the car for my departure.

162
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:54,333
To be safe, I'm going
