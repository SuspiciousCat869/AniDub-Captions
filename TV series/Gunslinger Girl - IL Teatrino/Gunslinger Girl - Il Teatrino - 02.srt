1
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,916
Pinocchio...

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,166
Do you remember
the target's face?

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,166
Yes, sir.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,541
I'll wait at the rendezvous
for 20 minutes...

5
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,333
If you take longer than that,
then you're on your own.

6
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:20,541
Are we clear?

7
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,125
Yes, sir. Clear.

8
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,041
He's just a kid...

9
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,041
You really think
this is a good idea?

10
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:41,500
John Doe wanted him to
take this guy out.

11
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,583
Actually... The whole
thing was his idea.

12
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,166
Huh...

13
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,791
No... no...

14
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,833
Good morning, Pinocchio!

15
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,208
Good morning, Aurora.

16
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,416
Are you on your way to work...?
And where do you work?

17
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,958
In Genoa.

18
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,833
Genoa...? That's really far...
When are you gonna be back?

19
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,041
No idea. I never know.

20
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,833
I hope you have a good time!

21
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,958
Oh, then it's really simple.
You just gotta repay your debt.

22
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,541
But how... a kid
couldn't do that...

23
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,541
Even a stinkin' dog could do it.

24
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,416
Look at you, already
coming up with excuses

25
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,125
and you haven't
even started yet.

26
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,208
It's that kinda crap that
makes you even less

27
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,416
than a stinkin' dog.

28
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:20,125
Good evening, Pinocchio.
How did everything go?

29
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,708
What are you doing
up there anyway?

30
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,250
Doing?

31
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,125
That's not an observatory.

32
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,916
I don't know if you've
ever thought about this,

33
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,291
but Mercedes is
a woman's name.

34
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,541
It was a hundred years ago when

35
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,500
the first of these
babies rolled out.

36
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,125
And to honor her
grace and beauty

37
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,541
they gave her a woman's name.

38
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,083
Then I better get off of her.

39
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,333
You should treat women
with a little more respect.

40
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,166
Get your old man to teach
you the ropes sometime.

41
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,166
It's not my job.

42
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,708
I've never been
good around girls.

43
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,583
Bruno told me what happened...

44
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,791
Seems everything went
off without a hitch.

45
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,708
Yes, it did, Sir.

46
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:21,416
I trust things are going
well for you in Montalcino.

47
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,083
I just think I'd be
more helpful to you

48
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,416
if I lived here, in Milan.

49
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,166
It's best you learn more about
the ways of the world first...

50
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,875
Otherwise, you'll be of
little use down the road.

51
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,333
Don't fret. You'll see
some action soon enough.

52
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,708
It's going to be a big job,
with some others involved...

53
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,291
You will meet up with
them at Montalcino...

54
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,291
Then you devise the plan.

55
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,666
Right... Yes, sir.

56
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,041
My countrymen...!

57
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,958
You must not lend your ears
to the separatist voice...!

58
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,583
Their abhorrent methods are
based in the warped logic

59
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,666
of those who believe that
violence will win the day!

60
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,291
They care nothing about the
plight of the average citizen.

61
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,000
Their only desire is to protect

62
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,375
their families
and their fortunes!

63
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,833
They have forgotten about
their duties as Christians--

64
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,208
the calling to help
and care for others...

65
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,625
Italy must abandon
this regionalism

66
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,166
and unify itself in
the truest sense!

67
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,416
I call out to Italy--
To all our...

68
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,708
I'm sorry for the wait.

69
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,208
We must stop this movement
towards regionalism

70
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,708
and nationalism
on the world stage!

71
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,916
Now, let us begin.

72
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,375
Our first piece of business,

73
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:42,458
and the major topic on the
table today, is which policy

74
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,583
we believe our Milan
Group should adopt.

75
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,250
It's obvious we
can't use the public

76
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,250
to hold demonstrations anymore.

77
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,583
The one in Rome two months ago
was a complete disaster...

78
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,541
I believe we need an entirely
fresh approach here.

79
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:56,750
I assume you mean attacking

80
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,083
the Bridge on the
Strait of Messina.

81
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,375
I have people drawing up
plans for its destruction...

82
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,416
If we can force
such a large-scale

83
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,583
public works project to halt...

84
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,291
We should be able
to keep the south

85
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,500
from sucking dry all of the
tax money from the north.

86
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,125
So who'll be doing it? Your
bombers Franco and Flanca?

87
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,458
That's right. And I've got
Pinocchio assisting them.

88
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,166
Of course, stopping
the construction

89
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,916
of the Messina Bridge has been
our ardent wish for many years.

90
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,416
And while I approve
of its sabotage,

91
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,541
I feel it best to explore
other methods as well.

92
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,666
After all, things take planning.

93
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,708
We can't just blow
up whatever we want

94
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,208
whenever we feel like it.

95
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,583
Pinocchio is that kid you
took in years ago, isn't he?

96
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:48,166
He's been under my guidance
for a very long time.

97
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,250
That judge two days ago is the
most recent example of his work.

98
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:56,333
It would seem showing pity was
the best choice in that matter.

99
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,125
The search continues for Judge
Berdini, who, two days ago,

100
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,291
disappeared from
a party in Genoa.

101
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,541
Of course this is the same
Judge Berdini who is

102
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,166
presiding over the tax-evasion
trial of Mr. Pirazzi, a wealthy

103
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,500
and famous Five Republics
Faction supporter from Milan.

104
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,541
This is leading local
authorities to believe that

105
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,875
it's possible he was abducted

106
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,750
by the Northern
Independence Faction.

107
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,791
Flanca... We've just been
contacted by Cristiano.

108
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,541
He says he has a job for us.

109
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,416
He wants more bombs?
You've gotta be kidding.

110
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,958
No, it's different this time.

111
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:03,291
So ol' Milan's in a state
of political confusion.

112
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,875
And our big sponsor seems to
be having legal troubles.

113
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,416
I heard something about
the government having

114
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,916
a secret agency
out in full force.

115
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,375
Word is they use
children as assassins.

116
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,541
Are you serious?
That's hard to believe.

117
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,875
I got a reliable source.

118
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,875
Apparently, it was
the same agency that

119
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,375
intercepted Cristiano's
men last winter...

120
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:28,250
during that accountant
incident in Florence.

121
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,333
So, what does Cristiano want?

122
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,000
We're supposed to
go to Montalcino

123
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,291
and there we'll
rendezvous with Pinocchio.

124
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:37,750
Pinocchio?
That's his son, right?

125
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:41,708
No. But he's
treated like a son.

126
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,791
Cristiano took him in when he
was a boy and trained him...

127
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,166
Now he's an assassin.

128
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,958
Pino!

129
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,458
Hey.

130
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,500
I'm so glad you came home!

131
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,833
It's been lonely around
here without you...

132
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,375
My mom thought you might
be coming home soon,

133
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,750
so she went to the market
and loaded up on prosciutto

134
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,791
and salami and
cheese and stuff--

135
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,791
I thought I told you before
you don't have to do that...

136
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,208
I'm just another guy who
lives in your neighborhood.

137
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,291
You're not just another guy...

138
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,041
You're so cool and easygoing...

139
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,583
So, Pino, what is it
you do for your job?

140
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,416
I'm just somebody's errand boy.

141
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,750
You are?

142
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,583
I figured you'd do something
cooler than that...

143
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,583
Like paint or record music...

144
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,416
Well, see you around.

145
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,041
I'll bring you by
some food later.

146
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,333
It's such a
wonderful spring day.

147
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,250
Yeah.

148
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,791
There's no better season
for driving, right?

149
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,375
No better season.

150
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,916
Calm down...
You're getting too excited.

151
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,000
Franco and Flanca I take it?

152
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,375
So, have we met before?

153
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,083
No... This would be
the first time...

154
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,916
Where should I park the car?

155
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,458
I'll show you the way.

156
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,208
Mind if I head inside?

157
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,833
Be my guest.

158
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,791
Is this a Mercedes?

159
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:45,083
No, it's an Alfa
Romeo Giulietta.

160
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You really Italian?

161
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,875
So this is a woman, too...

162
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,875
Are you two brother and sister?

163
00:15:55,958 --> 00:16:00,333
He's my partner, my bodyguard,
and my explosives mentor.

164
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,125
But we're not related.

165
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,000
No blood there.

166
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:50,083
Pinocchio. You don't hear
that name everyday.

167
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,875
It was the old man
who gave it to me...

168
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,125
Oh...

169
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,166
Does that make
Cristiano "Geppetto"?

170
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,250
Because that means that you're
the long nosed troublemaker.

171
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,666
I'm his devoted son.

172
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,291
All right then.

173
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,416
Mind if I take a shower
before we get started?

174
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,083
Sure. Go ahead.

175
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,375
Cristiano said we're
to work with you

176
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,291
on the sabotage of the bridge.

177
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,333
That's what I hear.

178
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,791
Can we trust you?

179
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,000
Can you afford not to?

180
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:32,791
I only trust what I've seen
with my own two eyes...

181
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:36,083
And so far from you
I've seen nothing.

182
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,291
They say your
specialty is knives...

183
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:45,333
I just feel better
with a knife.

184
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,541
Guns can be a little scary...

185
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,541
You think so?

186
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,541
Then what would you
do in this situation?

187
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,875
Is that a serious question?

188
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,291
I could kill you before
your next breath.

189
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,958
And if I was doing this
10 meters away from you?

190
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,958
I'd get nine meters closer.

191
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,250
Well that's a little
easier said than done.

192
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,250
That's true.

193
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,666
You have an old injury
in your left leg.

194
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,166
I'd take advantage
of that first.

195
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,791
You wanna give it a shot?

196
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,500
No... No need.

197
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,291
So where'd he go?

198
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,875
Out shopping.

199
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:40,041
Well I hope you boys played
nicely while I was gone.

200
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,000
What do you mean?

201
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,958
You've been dodgy since
he let us in the door.

202
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,833
We're freelance terrorists.

203
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,583
I don't think there's
anything odd about being

204
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,375
suspicious of each other.

205
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,708
True.

206
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:55,000
Pinocchio has this
reputation of being eccentric.

207
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,000
And it's well-earned.

208
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,416
I don't think you and I are in
any position to point fingers.

209
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500
You're different, Flanca.

210
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,083
So I'm the odd one out here?

211
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,958
Well why don't you tell me
what you think about him?

212
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:13,416
I don't know. But he is
an interesting one...

213
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,333
Maybe I'm... just motherly.

214
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,750
Buona sera, Pino!

215
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,000
Been shopping?

216
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,666
Yeah.

217
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,250
That's a lot of food
for one person.

218
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,291
And I didn't know
you drank wine.

219
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,333
I have guests.

220
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,916
Oh, that's nice...

221
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,375
Then I can just ask my mom to
make some food for them, too--

222
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,833
I'll pass. Sorry.

223
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,875
Okay...

224
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,125
Aurora?

225
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,500
Uh, yeah?

226
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:51,208
You need to stop
hanging around me.

227
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,541
What?

228
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,458
You're a nuisance,
you know that?

229
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,750
And you'll only
end up in trouble

230
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,916
or worse if you
keep this crap up.

231
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,416
Why, Pino?

232
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,333
Because I'm the long
nosed troublemaker-

233
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,583
that's all I know how to be.

234
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:19,083
So that's the Strait
of Messina Bridge?

235
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,333
You don't know anything do you?

236
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:24,958
That is a CG mockup of what it
will look like when it's done.

237
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,333
If they ever do complete it,

238
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,916
it'll be the largest
suspension bridge in the world.

239
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,333
So far, only its support columns
have actually been built.

240
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,666
Our best bet, if we're
going to blow up anything,

241
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,250
is to use one of them.

242
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,833
Hmmm...

243
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:41,375
The north is incurring almost
all of the construction costs...

244
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,166
Of course all of the
profits will end up

245
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,791
going to those damn
crooks in the south.

246
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,250
More than anything
else right now,

247
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,416
the F.R.F. wants
this bridge down.

248
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,166
It's gonna be one big job.

249
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,375
Are we planting the bombs
ourselves or are we hiring out?

250
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,541
We do it.

251
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,166
Amateurs wouldn't
be able to take down

252
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,958
a structure like this
on their best day.

253
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,791
And when you get a bunch
of amateurs involved,

254
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,583
bad things happen and
innocent people get hurt.

255
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,000
You got a problem with killing?

256
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,166
I only approve of killing
when it's necessary...

257
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,166
Anything less and I'd be nothing
more than an ordinary outlaw.

258
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,458
Flanca's weird.

259
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,125
Most of the terrorists
I've known in my day

260
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,291
have been angry
about something.

261
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:29,833
But not her. Or if it is anger,
there's something gentle to it.

262
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,750
You think so?

263
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,500
It's too bad she's nice enough
to choose who she kills.

264
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,833
If you ask me, that sounds
like one hell of a handicap.

265
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:42,375
She's different.
Not your ordinary terrorist.

266
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,875
Honestly?

267
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,208
She doesn't care about stopping
the bridge's construction.

268
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,333
Okay, then what about you?

269
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:52,791
I don't follow any
ideas or principles.

270
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,125
I hear you and
Cristiano are close.

271
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,208
Well, he did raise me.

272
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:01,000
That the only reason you
have to swear loyalty?

273
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:04,541
No... He's all that I have.

274
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,750
What's Flanca to you?

275
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,750
I'm a man who's lost his
goals along the way...

276
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,541
and she gives me new ones.

277
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:36,083
I'm amazed that Angelica
has recovered this well.

278
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,333
I don't know if she's
work-ready just yet...

279
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:41,166
I mean, she's fresh
out of the medical ward.

280
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:49,500
Nevertheless, we're ordered
to Milan tomorrow.

281
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,666
So...

282
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,083
I hear Special Ops Section 1
is sending you to Montalcino...

283
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,666
That's right.

284
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,750
Apparently, some Public Safety
offical's gone missing there.

285
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,333
Yeah, I heard...

286
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:07,791
I also heard that Public
Safety is desperate to find

287
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,875
some F.R.F. assassin
called Pinocchio now...

288
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:14,125
I believe my trip to Milan even
has something to do with it.

289
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:15,541
Watch yourself.

290
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:18,208
Milan's a central location
for those F.R.F. bastards.

291
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:21,625
We'll be fine...
You watch yourself...

292
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:24,583
Section 1 blames us when
anything bad happens...

293
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,333
They might try to
screw over Section 2

294
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,458
and laugh from the shadows.

295
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,125
I'll be careful.
