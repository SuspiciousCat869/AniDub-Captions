1
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,916
I won't be long.

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,416
Got it.

3
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:04,625
Fernando.

4
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,833
Jean?

5
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:14,958
Did you complete
your military service?

6
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,250
Why the hell are you here?!

7
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:22,125
How dare you come here and
show your face to my sister!

8
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:24,875
You get to live your cushy
life with no worries...

9
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:27,958
never stopping to
make the Padania pay!

10
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:33,666
Say something...
Anything, you bastard.

11
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,791
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:47,750
Your shirt...

13
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:51,125
Are you part of the
left-wing movement now?

14
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:54,125
That's a bad idea...
Getting into these politics...

15
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:57,083
It's more dangerous
than you think.

16
00:01:57,166 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm gonna make them
pay for what they did...

17
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,500
I have to avenge my sister!

18
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:10,583
Why? Why, Jean...

19
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,500
I used to be so proud of you.

20
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,708
You're the one
guy I looked up to.

21
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:21,166
I couldn't wait for you
to marry my sister...

22
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,791
so we could finally be brothers.

23
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,625
Hey. What do you need?

24
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,250
I ran into Fernando.

25
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,583
No kidding. He came to
visit her grave too?

26
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,625
He was acting strangely...

27
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:44,000
I want you to tail him
when he leaves here.

28
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,333
Got it.

29
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,541
Hi, Sofia...

30
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,833
I want you to know that
over these past two years,

31
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:15,500
I've killed 56 Padania members.

32
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,375
And I promise you that
I will continue this fight,

33
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:21,333
until they're wiped off
the face of the earth.

34
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,916
Damn...

35
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,083
It's Fernando...

36
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,583
I'm heading back to
the apartment now...

37
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,875
One thing...
I'm going to need a gun.

38
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,291
Alright. He's on the move.

39
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll continue to shadow him at
a distance and keep you posted.

40
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,375
Don't do anything
stupid, tough guy...

41
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,083
You don't wanna
throw your life away.

42
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,958
You're a cop?! Dammit!

43
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,750
All we got is that
he was planning

44
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,416
to attack
that apartment.

45
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,041
Not exactly sure why.

46
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,291
Whose place is it?

47
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,250
I asked around,
but didn't get much...

48
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:26,125
Some people said that a man
from Venice moved in recently.

49
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,041
The Venice Faction.

50
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,333
It could be, I suppose.

51
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,458
Doesn't surprise me--
Venice has been sending

52
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,875
a fair amount of
terrorists into Rome lately.

53
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,750
If nothing else,
I know that Fernando

54
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,625
is part of the
left-wing movement...

55
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:42,208
He probably heard about the
apartment from an associate.

56
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,333
I have no problem
making him talk.

57
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,708
But he's your old pal, so
I'd rather have your say so.

58
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,833
So what do we do...? Your call.

59
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:56,291
If a Padania member lives here,
we take care of him and we go.

60
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,708
Done. I'll get us ready.

61
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,000
Angelica...

62
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,958
And then Fernando...
What should we do about him?

63
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,666
We'll hand him over
to the local police

64
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,458
and have him cool
off for a week or two.

65
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,083
Must be frustrating.

66
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,708
But I know exactly how he feels.

67
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,458
Oh, yeah... I do too.

68
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:30,583
You ready, Angelica?
It's go time.

69
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,500
I'm ready, Marco.

70
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,250
Who is it?

71
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,750
It's the police. I have
some questions for you.

72
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,000
Don't move!

73
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,250
Jean...

74
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:37,333
Now... Make this
son-of-a-bitch talk.

75
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,625
I'll get started.

76
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,666
Rico?

77
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,041
You want to tell me just
what you're doing there?

78
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:48,041
Uh... I don't' know...
My... My hands are--

79
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,208
We have more work to do.

80
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,958
What is wrong?

81
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,041
You can't stand up?

82
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,041
Jean, Jean please!

83
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:13,166
I've no need for
someone who's useless.

84
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,125
Do you have everything
you need, Rico?

85
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:00,333
Yes... I sure do.

86
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,458
We'll take the car
all the way to Rome...

87
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:05,500
That should put us in
Venice by the afternoon.

88
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,125
I... have a question.

89
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,666
Yeah, what is it?

90
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,875
Why's your face hurt?

91
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,375
Don't worry about it.
It's nothing.

92
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,916
Yes, sir.

93
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,500
There's a large
wealth gap between

94
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,541
the north half of
Italy and the south.

95
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,458
Which is why we have
these rich northerners

96
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:31,541
doing everything they can to
turn Italy into a federal union.

97
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,500
These radical
nationalists are known as

98
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:37,166
the Five Republics Faction,
or FRF, due to its original

99
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,166
advocacy for splitting Italy
into five separate states.

100
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:46,500
Milan is in the north.
Rome in the middle...

101
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,833
And Naples in the south.

102
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:53,125
Toss in Sardinia...
toss in Sicily... there you go.

103
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,416
Alright...

104
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,000
Then where does the
Venice Faction come from?

105
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,958
The Milan Faction
wanted to separate

106
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:01,041
the entire northern region.
And the Venice Faction,

107
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:04,000
only wanted to liberate
the Veneto province.

108
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,666
Which caused a fair amount
of contention between them.

109
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:12,041
Sounds like a story
from the Renaissance.

110
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,541
He's a Padanian politician.

111
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,041
What's Padania?

112
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,416
The Milan Faction
once called itself

113
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,958
the Padania Republic Faction
and declared its independence.

114
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,833
So now Padania is
just another name used

115
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:35,458
for the Five Republics Faction.

116
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,916
Sounds like everyone has
plenty of enemies left around.

117
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,250
Yeah, but we're winning...

118
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,333
Especially after Milan.

119
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,666
But it's not over yet.

120
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,625
There are still a lot
of them out there.

121
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:54,291
Excuse me... Sorry about that.

122
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,291
It's fine.

123
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,083
Are you Jean from Rome?

124
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,916
Yes.

125
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,458
My name's Altmeyer.
I'm with the Venice Branch.

126
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,125
Thanks for coming.

127
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,000
So your name...
I'm guessing it's German?

128
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,625
Sure is... Yeah...

129
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,666
It makes things twice
as hard for me with

130
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,916
the Venice Faction
always sniffing around here.

131
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,125
So, what brings the two
of you here out of the blue?

132
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,541
We caught word that there are
some Padanian operatives here,

133
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,791
and we needed a good guide
to make sure we find them.

134
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,125
We're a branch office.

135
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,875
We focus on
information-gathering.

136
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,875
You're not gonna go raise
a lot of hell, are you?

137
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,250
We can handle the hell we raise.

138
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,250
There are a lot more
patrol boats these days.

139
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,458
Yeah.

140
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,541
Are they having
terrorism problems?

141
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:03,666
No, Rico...

142
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,708
Padania doesn't
bother wasting its time

143
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,958
attacking
sightseeing locations.

144
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,333
They're doing all this for
the tourists peace of mind.

145
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,000
Europe has a long history
of being politically unstable,

146
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,791
and they think this helps.

147
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,416
They're policemen
on military service.

148
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,875
Right.

149
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,000
They wear the uniform but
don't have decent training.

150
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,416
The only thing that those
clowns are really any good for

151
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,083
is a parade.

152
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,500
Um, I'm wondering...

153
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,458
How long until we
can get to work?

154
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:35,166
Don't rush it...
We're waiting until night fall.

155
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,791
Do you know the man
living at this address?

156
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,916
I do... He's a local Mafia boss.

157
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,666
Did you know he's sending
terrorists into Rome every day?

158
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,791
No, that one's new to me.

159
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,791
I can't say I'm knocked
over by surprise that

160
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:01,875
the local Mafia is in bed with 
the Venice Faction, though.

161
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,500
What's the plan?

162
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,125
We go in and we either
capture him or kill him.

163
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:11,625
The two of you...?
But she's just a little girl!

164
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,375
Plus, his bodyguards are
former San Marco marines!

165
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,250
Those guys'll rip
you two to pieces!

166
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,041
She's not just a girl...

167
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:25,000
She is a most
invaluable tool to me.

168
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,458
I can't do it without her.

169
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,875
What is it?

170
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:53,416
Hey... What's up?
How're things going?

171
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,333
That's it, Jean sir... All done.

172
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,666
Whoa!

173
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,791
We should probably
get out of here

174
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,333
before more of
these guys show up.

175
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,166
Jean, look.

176
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,833
Looks like their PC
is still logged in.

177
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,041
We can use this to learn
more about their organization.

178
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,291
Tomorrow will be fun.

179
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,208
Yes, sir.

180
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,291
Wait a second...
You're not done?

181
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,541
After all this blood,
all these corpses, and that PC,

182
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:19,583
you're still not satisfied
with what you've got?

183
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,083
No.

184
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,958
Rico! Stop that damn
boat right now!

185
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,625
Kill them all if you have to!

186
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:50,791
Yes, sir!

187
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,375
No!

188
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,333
She's been hit!

189
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,833
Are you all right...?
Where did the bullet hit you?

190
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,916
So pretty...

191
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,291
I never knew you enjoyed
the sea, this much.

192
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,125
I do.

193
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:26,750
It's breathtaking...
so beautiful...

194
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,916
It always makes me so sad.

195
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,333
Especially at sunset.

196
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,666
Forget about it...
Just run along and play.

197
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,375
I'll be relaxing up here.

198
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,750
Okay.

199
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:13,916
Silly...
