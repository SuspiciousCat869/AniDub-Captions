1
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,333
Caterina, you can't be serious.

2
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,166
You're really dropping
out of school?

3
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,875
Yeah. I turned in all
of the documents today.

4
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:42,541
It's just so sudden...

5
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:47,041
Why didn't you come and
talk to me about it first?

6
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:51,291
I'm sorry, Patricia...
But I've already decided.

7
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,333
Couldn't you just
take some time off?

8
00:00:57,416 --> 00:01:00,041
I'm taking the
country to court...

9
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,833
I have to give it
everything I've got.

10
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:06,250
If it goes to trial,
do you think you can win?

11
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,458
My father's lawyer and
a few of his friends

12
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,291
are going to help me out.

13
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:15,750
I know... I won't lose.

14
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:20,083
So you never told me
how that whole thing

15
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,333
turned out with that
officer at the Pantheon.

16
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:26,041
Oh... Well, he keeps
asking me out all the time.

17
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,375
That's good...

18
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:28,791
So things are going better
than I thought, huh...

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,958
The guy seemed to be
so pushy at first,

20
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,000
I wasn't sure if
he was your type.

21
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:37,041
Come on. I have you
to thank, you know it.

22
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,833
If you hadn't been
with us at the movies,

23
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:42,041
I don't know if he
and I would've spoken.

24
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,083
He's nicer than you
thought he'd be, right?

25
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,583
Yeah.

26
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,750
Of course... I went through
all that trouble for you...

27
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,875
Don't screw it up now.

28
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:59,416
Sitting out there alone
again... He's weird.

29
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,791
Can't argue with that.

30
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,625
The three of us have been out
here for a solid month now...

31
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,500
And he still acts likes
he met us yesterday.

32
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,125
Too bad for him.

33
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,250
I assume he doesn't
value much in life

34
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,750
or feel anything
close to happiness.

35
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,833
I'm surprised to hear
that coming from you.

36
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,583
Well, it's about time
for me to hit the road...

37
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:50,125
You get the documents ready
for presentation, okay?

38
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,833
You going in to
Rome to see Nino?

39
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:56,791
Yeah... Thought I'd
check to see how he is.

40
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,666
I don't like this.

41
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,875
I can't imagine you would.
But someday... you'll get it.

42
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,958
How can you be so sure?

43
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,625
Flanca, what is it
you're fighting against?

44
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,916
Do you even know when
victory will be yours?

45
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,458
If you're in this to
avenge your old man...

46
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:27,791
Tell me how many people have
to die to set things right.

47
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,291
Think that over now,
while you still got the time.

48
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,375
Don't wait until you're
an old dog like me

49
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,625
who doesn't have it in him
to keep running anymore.

50
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:55,125
Nino. You were weak.
That was the problem.

51
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,833
Caterina. I'm so sorry
about your father.

52
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:08,500
I never thought he would have
been fated to die in prison.

53
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,875
Uncle Marinov, I have to ask...

54
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,541
Were the charges...

55
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,083
Were the charges
against my dad faked?

56
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,958
I'm not sure, but what I do
know is he wasn't a man to keep

57
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,000
connections to the
underworld like me.

58
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,750
There are too many
suspicious things

59
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:25,041
about the charges against
him to know for sure.

60
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:33,208
Tell me... What do
you intend to do now?

61
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,166
I won't give up.

62
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,875
It's been a long time...

63
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,833
Good to see you
again, Uncle Marinov.

64
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:58,250
You've grown up
well, my Caterina.

65
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,583
It must've been...
about eight years ago

66
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,083
when you declared you were
going to become an activist.

67
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:07,708
I didn't think you had it
in you, but here you are.

68
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,250
I need to know...

69
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,291
Were you ever able to find out
anything about your father?

70
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:15,083
I didn't... and that's
not what I focus on now.

71
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,250
So the path of truth has
given way to that of revenge.

72
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:21,166
I see.

73
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,291
I would assume you're working
with Cristiano of Milan now,

74
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,208
is that correct?

75
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,375
Yes.

76
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,833
Then you must be careful.

77
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,916
The northern isolationists
are fighting the government

78
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,500
in the open now, not to mention

79
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,125
their ongoing internal
struggles for power.

80
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,708
Don't get caught up in their
petty in-fighting, Caterina.

81
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:54,000
Hey Jeremiah, look at this.

82
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,208
The blonde woman there...
It's Flanca.

83
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,541
No way.

84
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,500
That's definitely her.

85
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,791
Same lady Special Ops
tusseled with in Montalchino.

86
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,333
From the wanted posters?

87
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:08,958
But why would she come
to see that broker, here?

88
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,625
Who cares? I'm gonna call it in.

89
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:15,250
Irma... It's Jeremiah.
Where are you right now?

90
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:18,708
Driving around the highway loop.
I'm over the near the airport.

91
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:22,500
At the stakeout, we've spotted
a wanted Padania agent.

92
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,541
Let's meet at the rendezvous...

93
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,333
be sure and bring Vito with you.

94
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,541
Got it.

95
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,625
So what's the deal?
What are we doin'?

96
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,125
What do you think
we're doin'...?

97
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,791
We're gonna catch her.

98
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,916
I don't teach anyone anymore.
I've given that crap up.

99
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,208
So just turn the hell
around and get out of here.

100
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,625
Franco, please...

101
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,500
There hasn't been a
greater bomb crafter

102
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,041
in our lifetime than
your grandfather!

103
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:53,125
I know he trained you to make
bombs the same way he did.

104
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,916
Listen, making bombs
wasn't quite the life plan

105
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I had hoped for...

106
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:03,458
I just helped the old man
out when he needed it.

107
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,708
He died last month anyway.

108
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,500
So there's no reason to
continue down that road.

109
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:14,041
Now leave, would you? Before
it gets so dark that you can't.

110
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,916
You didn't listen to
a single word I said.

111
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,041
Those in this world
with great power

112
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,625
are obligated to put
those skills to work!

113
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:40,958
Power...?

114
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,333
Lady the last thing
I have is any power.

115
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,166
All anyone wants
or needs these days

116
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,458
are simple bombs that they
can detonate by cell phone.

117
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,041
My grandfather...

118
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,250
He devoted himself entirely to
the art of the handcrafted bomb.

119
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:59,083
Which today, most people
would call antiquated.

120
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,791
Who told you about me?

121
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:06,750
Someone close... Angelo Marinov.

122
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,625
Marinov, huh...?

123
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,166
Then you must've
been turned down

124
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,833
by plenty of others
before you came to me.

125
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,875
That's the way
things work, right?

126
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,708
You get a list and
you start at the top,

127
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,083
then work your way down.

128
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,000
And it doesn't matter
what list it is,

129
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,416
usually, I'm the guy
near the bottom.

130
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,208
So what game are
you playing here?

131
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,833
What kind of a plan does a green
killer like you have stewing.

132
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:36,125
My father was convicted on
false charges and imprisoned.

133
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:40,833
I took the case to court, but
he died before we could try it.

134
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,708
You want revenge?

135
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,875
I want to change
an unjust world!

136
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,791
That's nice. Then find
Jesus and preach the word.

137
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,583
Keep your hands off me...

138
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,250
You don't have all he
answers to everything,

139
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,458
you drunk son of a bitch!

140
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,625
How would you know anything

141
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,375
sitting around here
smashed all day?!

142
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,083
Stop! Please!

143
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,916
Oh, thank you! It's my
wife! She's needs help!

144
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,750
Can you help us?!

145
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:30,750
What's wrong?!

146
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,291
We were on our way
to the hospital

147
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,833
and the car just
stopped running!

148
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,666
This looks bad.

149
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,208
Help me get her into my car.

150
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,166
Don't move!

151
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:55,875
Hey, what's going on?

152
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,875
I'm going to pick up Flanca.

153
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,625
Did something happen?

154
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,416
The tracker on the car says
its sitting off the highway

155
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,958
and hasn't moved.

156
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,708
Is she in danger?

157
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,250
Probably.

158
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:23,416
It's her, alright.
Flanca of the Padania.

159
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,875
That's a big fish...

160
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,583
One of us should inform the
chief when we leave here.

161
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,208
Calm down, don't be
in such a rush...

162
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,833
We haul her back to
headquarters and

163
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,416
Public Safety's gonna yank
her right out from under us.

164
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,708
We should have her talk
while we have the opportunity.

165
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,333
Do whatever you want...

166
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:43,416
Me... I'm gonna go file
a report... Matthias!

167
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,791
Right... Her stuff.

168
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,958
Yeah, gather all her things
and take it upstairs.

169
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,708
Of course.

170
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,541
Say, Irma. You absolutely
sure about this?

171
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,833
About what?

172
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,375
'Bout Jeremiah...

173
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,791
I gotta admit, I'm a little
worried that he might kill her.

174
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,416
Have faith in your associates.

175
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,916
Look, It was for your sake
that he... uh, no, nothing.

176
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,708
Let's let him
unwind a bit, okay?

177
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,583
Keep it up... I have
nothing to tell you!

178
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:35,041
That's gonna work just fine
'cuz I have nothing to ask you.

179
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:42,250
Look... you bitch...
I only want to make you hurt.

180
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,916
So you're telling me the
pregnant girl in the car

181
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,958
was just a ruse...?

182
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,958
Thank goodn--

183
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,291
Her name is Irma!

184
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,250
And she almost died
three years ago

185
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,958
in an explosion you designed.

186
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,375
She still has a boatload of
shrapnel swimming around

187
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,375
in her stomach, thanks to you!

188
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,458
While I'm on the subject,
you should know that

189
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:12,708
that same bombing took my left
eye and two of my fingers!

190
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,708
Tell me... How does that feel?!

191
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,333
I asked you how does that feel!

192
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,875
Every person in the world

193
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,541
carries around some
kind of hatred.

194
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,750
If you think being hurt makes
you special, I'm sorry...

195
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,041
you're gravely mistaken.

196
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,958
Matthias!

197
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,833
You...? His student...? Come on.

198
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:57,000
Your names Nino, isn't it?
So Nino, just what's so funny?

199
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,458
It's damn near impossible
to believe Franco

200
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,666
can teach a woman anything!
Don't you think so, bro?

201
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,375
And anyway, I thought you quit

202
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,583
the bomb-making
business again, Franco?

203
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,458
Something must've
stirred you up...

204
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,875
Love at first sight?

205
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:14,250
It's nothing like that.
Let's go, Franco. C'mon.

206
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,625
Calm down, Miss... Miss...

207
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,083
What was your name?

208
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,000
Call her Flanca.

209
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,083
What is that?
Some kind of alias?

210
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,708
'Cuz it's a masterpiece!

211
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:34,958
Franco...

212
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,708
Good, you're conscious...
Hold still.

213
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,041
Are you badly hurt?

214
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,375
Uh... No...

215
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,166
Bastard.

216
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:54,375
How do you think I'm
feeling now, you prick?

217
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,708
Oh, no. It's Irma.

218
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,875
Too late. She's dead.

219
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,916
Damn Padania...

220
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,916
No, wait!

221
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,125
Not good!

222
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:58,416
Henrietta! Can you stand?!

223
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:06,625
Thank you... You saved
everyone's lives, you know?

224
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,291
Great.

225
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,750
That's a pretty screwed up
thing using a body as a bomb...

226
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:17,208
I bet they get off on this
stuff... The bastards...

227
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,250
Are you alright?

228
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:30,083
Hilshire, get up!
Are you hurt?

229
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,916
No, I'll be fine.

230
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,083
Triela, you're bleeding!

231
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,791
It's just a scratch...
I can have it stitched up.

232
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,541
Hilshire! You guys get hit?!

233
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:50,041
We're fine. Just a couple nicks.

234
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:06,250
It was him... He was here...

235
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,583
You ran into some
real trouble out there.

236
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,791
Don't worry. They'll get
what's coming to them.

237
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,625
Franco.

238
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:37,041
Thank you... Thanks
for coming to get me.

239
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,750
Maybe now you've
learned your lesson

240
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,000
not to run off on
your own anymore.

241
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:45,291
I did... I think I'll be
taking it easy for a while.

242
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:48,041
At least until we
blow the bridge.

243
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,208
Where are you going?

244
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,791
Out in the hall.

245
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:57,958
Pinocchio... I owe you
a thanks, as well...

246
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,541
You came through today
with flying colors.

247
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:05,708
Well... Yeah... I guess
I did, so you're welcome.

248
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,125
Pinocchio...

249
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:44,333
Uncle, hi! What are
you doing here?!

250
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:47,333
Marinov let me know
about the recent debacle...

251
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:50,750
I came here to see
how Flanca was doing.

252
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,416
She's right through
here, isn't she?

253
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,125
--Yes.
--Good.

254
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:06,583
I heard about your hesitation
to kill in Montalcino.

255
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:08,375
That was because...

256
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:12,750
A hired killer is done for...
when he hesitates even one time.

257
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:26,791
Forget about that...

258
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:30,833
I also heard that you saved
Flanca's life today, right?

259
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,791
Well done.

260
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:35,708
Thank you... Uncle.
