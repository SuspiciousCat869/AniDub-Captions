1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:17,541
What I'd really like is
for Jose to care for me

2
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:20,083
even more than he already does.

3
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,916
Do you think if I told him that,
it would make him not like me?

4
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:37,041
I aware that I'm treated much
better than the other girls...!

5
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:42,958
Dr. Bianchi... Do you think
I'm being selfish about this?

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,875
Don't worry about it.

7
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:55,083
There's nothing wrong
with feeling this way.

8
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,500
Brother!

9
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:04,125
I heard you're going
to the Balkans.

10
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:05,916
Is that true, Jose?

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,791
I'll be back before
you know it...

12
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,166
It'll only be six months.

13
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,500
But no...!

14
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:15,250
They say the radiation
is too dangerous.

15
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:18,125
Don't worry.
You won't get lonely.

16
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:21,000
Our brother will be here.

17
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:25,208
But he might as well not be.
Jean never comes to my recitals.

18
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:28,500
But you're always there.

19
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:31,708
I get the feeling from father
and mother and Jean...

20
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:35,750
that work is more important to
them than anything that I do...

21
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:39,458
All they ever do is leave
me at home all by myself.

22
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,291
That's not true.

23
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:46,875
They all love you more
than you could ever imagine.

24
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:50,625
When I grow up I'm going to
join the military police...!

25
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:54,166
That way, you and
I will always be--

26
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,500
Being an M.P. in this
country isn't great...

27
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,625
It's very dangerous.

28
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:02,375
Just stick with being a harp
soloist, Enrica. Alright?

29
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,083
Just a dream...

30
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,333
You awake, Jose?

31
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,416
Why don't you go to bed if
you're planning on sleeping.

32
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,750
Yeah, I think I will.

33
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,041
I'm meeting
Marcantonio tomorrow.

34
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,583
Second Lieutenant Abbado?

35
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:13,291
You joined the MP's together.
So how long's it been?

36
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,416
Five or six years...

37
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,958
I haven't seen him
since my discharge.

38
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,291
Whoa, Jose. You're getting
kinda shaggy on top.

39
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,375
So what do you do
these days? PMC work?

40
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,791
No... not close...

41
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,625
A buddy hooked me up
with public welfare.

42
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:42,833
Seriously?

43
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,416
Is that strange?

44
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,791
Yeah, guess that whole incident
must've been pretty hard on you.

45
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:53,416
Yeah, it was...
You wouldn't believe.

46
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,166
Everything I heard about
that whole mess was crazy...

47
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,416
It makes total sense to me
why you and your brother

48
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,791
quit the military police.

49
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,458
Enough about me.
How are things with you?

50
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,958
I assume you're still involved

51
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,583
with the First
Parachute Regiment?

52
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:14,791
Oh, no... I'm the leader of
a patrol squad in Molise...

53
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:18,250
We uh, handle
kidnappings and smuggling.

54
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,666
You? Commanding a
reconnaissance squad?

55
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,916
That funny?

56
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,875
The only reason I
wound up with the job

57
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,333
is because you bailed on us...

58
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:30,625
Listen, I had the easy life when
you were head of the class...

59
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,666
Back in the days
of our Balkans PKF.

60
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,208
How's your mother doing?

61
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:46,583
I always loved her cooking...
She made the best salsichia.

62
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,416
She's dead.

63
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:54,416
Year before last, she was
in a demonstration...

64
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,416
A tear gas round hit her
on the head, and killed her.

65
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,625
I'm sorry...

66
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,333
Who was it that
played the harp...?

67
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,541
Wasn't it your sister?

68
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,208
It was.

69
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,250
Oh my god!

70
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,166
Terrorists.

71
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,833
Of course.

72
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,333
Miss, you're all right.
Come on stand up.

73
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,583
We gotta move.

74
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:17,083
Beatrice. He's headed
your way. Slow him down.

75
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,375
Understood, Sir.

76
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,166
Hey Bea... Smell him.

77
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,708
Yes, sir.

78
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,333
Military grade explosives.

79
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:46,208
So you're the one behind
yesterday's bombing.

80
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,291
Answer me or I'll make it hurt.

81
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,041
Not so fast, Jean...

82
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,625
Why don't we go take a look
at this idiot's place first...

83
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,125
After all, he's a
blue... A Padania.

84
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,500
Which means he's hiding some
kind of evidence somewhere.

85
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,333
Did you find it, Bea?

86
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,708
Yes.

87
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,166
Here.

88
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,125
Wanna tell me how
you acquired this...?

89
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,958
Only military men
can get their hands

90
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,250
on such high-grade explosives.

91
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:39,750
Rico.

92
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,500
Do you want me to get started?

93
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,208
I want you to hurt him
until he decides to talk.

94
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,875
Yes, sir.

95
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,041
I feel bad for him.

96
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,666
He's committed a
serious offense...

97
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,750
He can feel bad for
himself behind bars.

98
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,000
She keeps that up in there,
and they'll learn real quick

99
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,583
that you can't
question a dead guy.

100
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,625
Jose...

101
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,708
Is that the river Princess Ann
swam in in 'Roman Holiday'?

102
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,208
It sure is.

103
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,166
Then is that bridge where
she fought using the guitar?!

104
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,875
Yes. That's right.

105
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:57,833
Castel Sant'Angelo...
Sucha beautiful place.

106
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,791
I think Tosca also takes
place in this castle.

107
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,375
Tosca?

108
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,583
Yeah, it's an opera.

109
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:08,125
The last scene takes place
by that big angel statue.

110
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,416
There's a Colonel Gagne

111
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,958
who's the supervisor of
military logistics in Molise.

112
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,625
I've heard the nasty
rumors for some time now

113
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,958
that he's been funneling
weapons to the black market.

114
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,416
The Padania has been
exceptionally well-armed

115
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,625
since the beginning
of this year...

116
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,875
Just last week we uncovered
a large amount of

117
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,500
military-grade explosives.

118
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,291
We need proof...

119
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,583
Find that and the
military police will be

120
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,833
forced to approve of the
colonel's assassination.

121
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,791
Understood, sir.

122
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,125
At what point do you
think this will ever end?

123
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,208
When will what end,
Lieutenant Colonel?

124
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,625
The fighting, the madness.

125
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,125
Do you remember the
Balkans conflict...?

126
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:02,458
We fought under those gray skies
together for two whole years.

127
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:03,875
And against whom?

128
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,208
At the time, we didn't
have the slightest idea

129
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,333
who we were fighting.
Who was the enemy?

130
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,250
It was an
ethnic conflict...

131
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:14,333
We had to consider every
armed person an enemy.

132
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,916
You're wrong...

133
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,250
The adversary we fought
was hate itself...

134
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,000
So it makes perfect sense
that we have nothing to show

135
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,750
for all of our efforts.

136
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:29,833
We can only keep hate
buried for so long at a time.

137
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:33,125
The end will come someday.

138
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:36,583
Do you actually believe that?

139
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:37,833
I have to.

140
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,583
What other choice do
we have than to fight?

141
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,375
You're right.

142
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,833
That's all we can do...
or know to do.

143
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,666
Castel Sant'Angelo?

144
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,541
That's right.

145
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,250
Henrietta loves Princess Ann,

146
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,416
so she thought it was like
the greatest thing ever.

147
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,208
I believe Tosca better
represents Sant'Angelo.

148
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:02,291
The opera...?
Did you see it on video?

149
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,583
I did...

150
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,333
and I thought how
Henrietta would cry

151
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,166
if she heard the words.

152
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,458
Like, "I lived for my art,
I lived for love..."

153
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,083
Wait... How's it go again?

154
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,875
I lived for my art,
I lived for love,

155
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,041
I never did harm
to a living soul.

156
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:27,250
With a secret hand I relieved as
many misfortunes as I knew of.

157
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:31,791
Always with true faith my prayer
rose to the holy shrines.

158
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,625
Always with true faith
I gave flowers to the altar.

159
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,291
I gave jewels for
the Madonna's mantle,

160
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,416
and I gave my song to the stars,

161
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,000
to heaven, which
smiled with more beauty.

162
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,791
In the hour of grief...

163
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:51,250
Why, why, o Lord, ah,
why do you reward me thus?

164
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,500
Tosca takes place
200 years ago...

165
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,958
while Rome is under
a reign of terror.

166
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,375
A singer named Tosca
is the main character...

167
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,333
As for the story, Tosca's
lover Mario is arrested

168
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,000
and sentenced to death for
harboring a political criminal.

169
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,208
So she goes to the head
of the secret police,

170
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,458
Baron Scarpia,
to beg for Mario's life.

171
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:14,875
That's the basic premise.

172
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,708
You seem to know
a lot about it...

173
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,833
Have you always liked the opera?

174
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:22,125
Not really...
I wouldn't say I'm the type.

175
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:25,708
I saw it with a friend
of mine a long time ago.

176
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,166
All of the main
characters in Tosca

177
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,083
wind up dying by the end of it.

178
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,583
The same thing happens
in every Italian opera...

179
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,166
Murder, illness,
revenge, suicide...

180
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,041
People just keep dying
and dying and dying!

181
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:43,250
And do you happen to know
what that means, Beatrice?

182
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,916
I can't say I do.

183
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,500
It means Italians love tragedy.

184
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:54,500
They're sentimental about
everything, especially death.

185
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,666
That's why our cities are filled
with violence and vengeance.

186
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,791
That's why every solution we
devise is rooted in bloodshed.

187
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,083
I don't know, Bianchi...

188
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,041
It's been a lot more
exhausting than usually lately.

189
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,458
What has?

190
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,000
Henrietta and I can't
talk about anything real...

191
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,083
It's always just
stars and myths...

192
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,125
And the presents are
just a formality...

193
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,250
There's no true sincerety.

194
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,291
The poor kid's
starved for love...

195
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,250
I don't think it's
that big a deal Jose.

196
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,666
What's so wrong with
fulfilling that need for her?

197
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,250
What's the matter?

198
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,125
I was just thinking
about my little sister.

199
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:50,083
She spent a lot of her
time at home all alone.

200
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:53,333
The rest of us were too busy
with whatever we were doing...

201
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,541
I think we made her feel lonely.

202
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,958
And you wish you
could take it back?

203
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,916
Yeah.

204
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Be clever like a snake...

205
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:06,041
but also be simple
like a pigeon.

206
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,833
Uh... What's that?

207
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:13,625
It's an attitude you should
use to survive this world.

208
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,791
Well that's Easier
said than done, doc.

209
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,541
There's nothing wrong
with taking your time

210
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,083
to think over delicate matters.

211
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:25,958
It's a waste to feel
shame for acting shrewdly.

212
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,083
The answer's quite simple...

213
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:33,791
Basically... Just don't
think about it so hard.

214
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,166
I'll try.

215
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:52,625
Jean, the army truck just
made it through the pass.

216
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:56,833
I copy that, Ferro. Stop all
subsequent vehicles you see.

217
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,041
Roger.

218
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:06,000
What's the plan...?
Do we capture them or not?

219
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,250
If they concede,
we capture them.

220
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,583
Even if we kill them all,

221
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,291
the scene itself should
be proof enough.

222
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,708
You gotta be kidding...

223
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,458
Stop the truck!

224
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,250
Turn off the engine and
stay inside the vehicle!

225
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,291
Give us your names,
ranks, and cargo!

226
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,166
Go, now!

227
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,291
Hilshire! Do it!

228
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:53,875
Take the shot.

229
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,041
Yes, sir.

230
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,916
Jose, what did you
think of my shooting?

231
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,041
I hit the target every time,
and, uh... did you...

232
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,291
Yeah.

233
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,125
Turn around.

234
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,708
And one more time around.

235
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,375
It's not too tight, is it?

236
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,416
No.

237
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,916
And in the shoulders?

238
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,750
Feels fine.

239
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,583
Henrietta... Is that your dress?

240
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,791
Yeah.

241
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,916
Skirts are fun for a change...

242
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,833
They make neat
sounds when you move

243
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,583
Marcantonio blamed
the government

244
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,666
for his mother's death
and turned traitor.

245
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,500
It was easy for him
to assemble his team.

246
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,833
There are plenty
like him out there...

247
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,791
From then on, they worked
for Colonel Gagne

248
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,125
smuggling weapons off-duty.

249
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,333
The colonel's assassination
has been approved...

250
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,500
We'll do it next week.
He'll be here to see an opera.

251
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,625
I'll be there.

252
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:59,958
Jose... I can do this
one on my own, if you want.

253
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,250
No, I'll be fine...

254
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:08,000
It's not like it's worth
getting depressed over.

255
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,791
None of this ever is.

256
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:21,375
I guess this is my 'Clever
like a snake' time... Right...

257
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,250
There's nothing wrong
with taking your time

258
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:15,041
to think over delicate matters.

259
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,541
It's a waste to feel shame
for acting shrewdly.

260
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,125
Beautiful.

261
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,416
Jose...

262
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,125
Now, go on.

263
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,916
Yes, sir!

264
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,625
We're home!

265
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,625
Welcome back...
Did you two enjoy the opera?

266
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,083
We were working the whole time

267
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,958
so we didn't get
to see very much.

268
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,875
Right, I should have known that.

269
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:24,541
It's too bad though.
Tosca is quite a moving story.

270
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,750
I only got to see
the first part.

271
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,791
I have a question.

272
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,208
Rico, were you moved?

273
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:35,500
It kinda scared me how
loud it was in there.

274
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,750
Hey... Guess what, Rico.

275
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:43,750
In the theater when Jose saw
me, he said I was beautiful!

276
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,291
That's great!

277
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:49,083
The only thing Jean said to me
was, "It doesn't suit you."

278
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:53,583
"I lived for my art,
I lived for love."

279
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:03,416
So, tell me. What did you
think of the opera, Enrica?

280
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,291
D'you Still think
you're too young?

281
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,666
No, I had a really great time!

282
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,208
Excellent. I'm glad.

283
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:11,708
In fact, Jose...

284
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,125
I think I'm going to
be a harp soloist!

285
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:17,541
Someday, I'm going to play
my harp in this very theater!

286
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:21,041
Of course you will...
And I'll be there.

287
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,833
So when that day comes, you
have to make sure you bring

288
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:26,750
Mother, Father, and Jean
with you to watch me, okay?!

289
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:30,291
I will...! It's a promise!
