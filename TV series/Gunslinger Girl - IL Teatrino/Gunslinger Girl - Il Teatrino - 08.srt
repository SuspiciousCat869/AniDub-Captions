1
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,791
You sure do have a lot...

2
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:12,250
A lot of what?

3
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,916
Books.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,500
Oh.

5
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:20,375
We may not look it
on the outside, but...

6
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:24,208
People in our profession tend
to read books all the time.

7
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:29,875
It's my experience that
uneducated people...

8
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:32,541
tend to make very poor soldiers.

9
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,125
What kind of books
do you like to read?

10
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,541
Your file says that
before coming here,

11
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,916
your favorite thing to do--

12
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:58,916
No... never mind.

13
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:07,000
I'll read every book I
can get my hands on...

14
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:10,625
If that's what it takes
to make me a good soldier.

15
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,250
I put the bait on for you.

16
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,750
Now just cast the line
underhand like I showed you.

17
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:32,458
Now, we just sit and
wait for the fish.

18
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:34,791
Well if that's the case,
then you can definitely

19
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:38,333
count on me to act as
your legs from now on, sir.

20
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,166
But why did you keep these?

21
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,833
I want you to remember...

22
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:58,333
Always think clearly
before pulling the trigger.

23
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,333
I want you to be gentle, Claes,

24
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:03,208
whenever you put
those glasses on.

25
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,833
Now don't think of
this as an order...

26
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:09,416
It's a heart to heart promise.

27
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,458
Well, good morning, Triela.

28
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:25,041
Yeah, good morning...
How are you Claes?

29
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,708
I wish I had a mesosiderite.

30
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,083
I thought of it while I was
looking at the sky yesterday...

31
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,958
Probably because I've
been reading this book

32
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:39,000
about minerals recently.

33
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,333
You've got a real romantic
streak, you know that...

34
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,458
Let's go to the dining hall.

35
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,958
So are you going to the
training grounds again today?

36
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,583
Yeah... I'll be there
at least until dark.

37
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,458
You don't seem very happy.

38
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,416
I just have a lot
weighing on my mind...

39
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,708
But it's my problem.

40
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:12,625
Anyway, what are
you doing today?

41
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,875
The same things as every day.

42
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,791
Hey, Rico...

43
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,458
Yeah, what?

44
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,375
I'm sorry I yelled at
you the other day...

45
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,375
I know you didn't
mean to break it...

46
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,208
And the kaleidoscope is
fixed now, better than new.

47
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:52,208
So, Henrietta...
You're not mad at me anymore?

48
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,000
No.

49
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:57,833
That means a lot... Thank you.

50
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:01,000
You can stay by
my side again okay?

51
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,208
You should have
Jean buy you one.

52
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,958
What?

53
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,166
A mesosiderite.

54
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,875
Oh... Uh, no. That's okay.

55
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,416
Well, why wouldn't you?

56
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,958
It's not the kind
of thing you can

57
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,541
run out to the store and buy.

58
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,833
So what is it you're
trying to buy, Claes?

59
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,166
Oh, it's not that important.

60
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,041
You're... just eating
yogurt for breakfast?

61
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:41,916
Yes.

62
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,708
Are you not hungry or something?

63
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,583
This is all of the food
I am allowed to eat today...

64
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:50,166
I'm going to take my time,
so don't worry about me.

65
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,625
Huh...? The food...

66
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,708
It's already been taken away.

67
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:30,000
It's not long until lunch.
You'll be fine.

68
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,000
Look, Beatrice...

69
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:43,416
I have some cookies in my
room if you'd like a snack.

70
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,125
But... you'll have to
do some work for me.

71
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,083
Hey, what is all this?

72
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,208
Like vegetables.

73
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,666
So, they're weeds
that... you eat?

74
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,916
They're herbs.

75
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,750
Parsley, sage, rosemary...

76
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,458
Haven't you ever heard of
the song "Scarborough Fair"?

77
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,041
I don't think so.

78
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,791
Hello, Dr. Bergonzi.

79
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,375
How you doing Claes...?

80
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,833
Thanks for helping
us again today.

81
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:42,750
We're ah, going to do some
color dopplers of your heart.

82
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,083
Okay.

83
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:48,208
You seem like you're
exhausted, Doctor.

84
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,750
I suppose I've looked better.

85
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:56,000
There's an academic convention
next month; I'm preparing for.

86
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:59,708
It's the European
Cardiovascular Conference.

87
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,500
Thanks to you I can write
a pretty damn good paper.

88
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,041
I really appreciate your help.

89
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:07,750
You don't have to thank me.
It is my job, doctor.

90
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,000
Doctor Bergonzi... 

91
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:34,458
Do you happen to know the
song... "Scarborough Fair"?

92
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:35,791
It's a classic.

93
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,375
Strange and thought-provoking
at the same time.

94
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,833
"Tell her to find me
an acre of land...

95
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:45,208
'tween the salt water
and the sea strand..."

96
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:49,416
"Will you plough it
with a lamb's-horn..."

97
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,750
"And sow it all over
with one peppercorn..."

98
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,916
"And then you shall be...
a true-love of mine."

99
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,250
What do you suppose that means?

100
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,708
How's the testing coming
along? Any trouble?

101
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:43,958
No, thanks.

102
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,916
What about your day to
day life? How's that?

103
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,500
If you need anything,
you just let me know.

104
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,791
I will... But I'm
fine, really...

105
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:56,250
I can tend to my
vegetable garden when I want...

106
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,791
I can wander around
the campus at my leisure...

107
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,208
and I can play the piano.

108
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:05,500
Each day of my life
is full and complete.

109
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,750
Claes, about that piano...

110
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,125
It's always been here.

111
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:35,500
Long before the agency
was even formed.

112
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,791
That's very interesting.

113
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,041
A thousand years ago
the only thing out here

114
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,625
was a monestary
surrounded by fields...

115
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,458
It wasn't until
after their time

116
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,250
that an aristocrat bought
the land and built a villa.

117
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,166
The government started
using it at the start

118
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,958
of the 20th century. Now it's
our agency's main facility.

119
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,333
How neat...

120
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,458
I'm growing herbs on land
cultivated by monks...

121
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,875
around one thousand years ago...

122
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,541
Pretty much.

123
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,291
Claes, what's wrong?
We're finished here.

124
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,833
A question.

125
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:03,166
Have you ever been
tremendously sad...

126
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,458
but the tears won't come out?

127
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,250
Sure... It happens.

128
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,083
That's how I feel right now.

129
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:17,416
My heart is overflowing
with tears...

130
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,083
but they just won't
come out of my eyes.

131
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,666
At night when I'm asleep...

132
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,583
they quietly spill out onto
the pillow without my noticing.

133
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,833
I feel like I've
been here before...

134
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,875
Hey... C'm'ere.

135
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,958
Cyborgs need to be
with their Handlers

136
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,750
at all times in order to
use the shooting range.

137
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:05,875
I know... I just came to
look around for a bit...

138
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:09,541
Wait... Aren't you
Captain Raballo's girl?

139
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,291
Um...

140
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,041
Yeah, you used to come
here all the time...

141
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,000
always with that same
GIS baseball cap on.

142
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,541
And you fired a VP.

143
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,208
You looked a lot
different back then.

144
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,125
I guess I didn't recognize you.

145
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,250
That was really nice, Henrietta.

146
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,916
Now, how many shots
do you have left?

147
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,041
I have three.

148
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,083
Good at keeping track.

149
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,375
Hi, Claes!

150
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,750
Hello...

151
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,583
What are you doing here, Claes?

152
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,916
I was just passing by.

153
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,750
So I thought I'd stop
in and look around.

154
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,000
Henrietta.

155
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,416
Yes, sir?

156
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,541
I need you to remove the
magazine and empty the chamber.

157
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,125
Let's call it a day, alright?

158
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:39,000
Of course, Jose... I'll do it.

159
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,000
I didn't mean to
interrupt your training.

160
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,750
You didn't.
Don't worry about it.

161
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:52,208
Just make sure you stay on this
side of the white line, okay?

162
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,875
Yes, sir.

163
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm not sure why, but this
is such a familiar aroma...

164
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,750
Hey there, Claes!

165
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,750
What are you doing way
out here by yourself?

166
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,833
I'm not sure.

167
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,625
It's getting late.
You going to the dorms?

168
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,041
Yes.

169
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,958
Hop on. I can give you a ride.

170
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,416
It's a longer walk back
than you might think.

171
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Angelica can sit in front,
and you can sit in the back...

172
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,583
Why don't you hop off
and climb around.

173
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,666
Okay, sure thing, Priscilla.

174
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,791
I get to ride with the two
prettiest girls around here!

175
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,708
Will you plough it,
with a lamb's-horn...

176
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,958
And sow it all over
with one peppercorn...

177
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:02,541
And then you shall be
a true love of mine.

178
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,625
Ask him to reap it with
a sickle of leather...

179
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:11,375
and gather it up with
a rope made of heather...

180
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,750
For then he'll be
a true love of mine.

181
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,208
If you say that you can't,
then I shall reply...

182
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:32,000
Parsley, sage,
rosemary, and thyme...

183
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:36,208
Oh, let me know that
at least you will try...

184
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,333
I'm finally home.

185
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,958
Welcome back.

186
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,458
So what did you spend
your day doing?

187
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,541
It was the same as every day...

188
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,458
I cultivated some herbs in my
garden, and played the piano...

189
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,041
Sounds like fun.

190
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,083
Claes, tell me that's
not gunpowder I smell

191
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,500
coming off you.

192
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,166
Are you sure that you're not
smelling your hands instead?

193
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,000
Yeah, you're right!

194
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,166
I'm beat. Good night, Claes.

195
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,875
Good night.

196
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,500
So what do you do when these
actually grow into big plants?

197
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,875
I really haven't
thought much about it...

198
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,791
Maybe I'll use them
for an herbal bath

199
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,708
or something like that.

200
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,333
What's that?

201
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,291
Honestly, I don't know...

202
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,666
I think it could be
some kind of mineral.

203
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,041
Fascinating.

204
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,458
Beatrice...

205
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,458
Have you ever heard of
a rock called mesosiderite?

206
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,000
Na-uh...

207
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:21,875
They're basically asteroids
that fell to Earth long ago...

208
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,208
And they still hang around
the corners of the planet

209
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:26,416
just waiting to be noticed.

210
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,916
Don't you think
that's enchanting?

211
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,291
Is this fun for you?
Doing the same thing every day?

212
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:38,958
Yeah... Is that so weird?

213
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,500
I don't know...

214
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:43,750
I've never really known what
'fun' is supposed to be like...

215
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:46,541
It doesn't matter if I'm in
the dorms or if I'm out at work,

216
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:49,708
I don't think that I've ever
felt moved to a smile.

217
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:53,375
Maybe you can tell me why it is
you know how to enjoy yourself.

218
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,750
I don't know...

219
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:05,583
I suppose that someone must have
taught me how a long time ago.
