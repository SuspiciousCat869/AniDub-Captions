1
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,916
It's not even noon...
and you're drinking?

2
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,750
I just feel halfhearted
about the whole thing...

3
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:58,208
Do you remember
a long time ago,

4
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,916
the first time I
went to see you?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,541
Probably more than
you'd like me to.

6
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:05,291
You were one
presumptuous young lady.

7
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:10,166
The only reason I
became an activist

8
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,541
was to restore my
father's honor.

9
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,708
But I think that somewhere
down that righteous path

10
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:19,958
those pure intentions
might've gotten diluted.

11
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:29,708
Skirmishing with the government
like we did last night...

12
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,625
that makes me nothing
more than an outlaw.

13
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:36,500
Sounds to me like you
don't feel you're finished.

14
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:39,166
Will you come with me?

15
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,500
Of course. I always
have before, haven't I?

16
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,375
I hope we make it in time.

17
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:53,916
I'm gonna burn up the highway.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,333
You sure you're okay to drive?

19
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,541
Don't worry about it.
I'll sober up along the way.

20
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,750
Triela!

21
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,083
Go ahead, Hilshire...
I've got this one.

22
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,375
Let me help--

23
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,791
Triela, move!

24
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,250
Please, you have
to find Cristiano!

25
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:35,958
Uncle!

26
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,291
Pinocchio!

27
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,250
Pinocchio...

28
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:42,875
I just want--

29
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,500
Didn't you hear those
shots being fired...?!

30
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:48,291
You have to leave! Uncle, now!

31
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,541
I'm not going to
let you die here!

32
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,166
You must listen to me,
Pinocchio...!

33
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,500
I have made up my
mind about this.

34
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,958
I'm leaving.
I'm going into hiding...

35
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,083
Now you need to escape.

36
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,458
You will find a car
hidden in the courtyard...

37
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,833
Use this key.

38
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,791
Pinocchio...! I'm so sorry!

39
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,625
Please forgive me!

40
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,375
Hilshire, come in?

41
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,250
Triela! Are you all right?!

42
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,458
Pinocchio got away from me.
I'm looking for him now.

43
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:17,125
I'm squaring off with a guard,
second floor, front hallway!

44
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:19,958
Hilshire!

45
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,041
I'm fine! Just find Pinocchio!

46
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,708
Yes, sir!

47
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,875
I just can't hit him.

48
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,875
You monster...

49
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,333
That's mine!

50
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:24,125
That's the gun he stole
from me in Montalcino!

51
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:48,666
How dare he shoot me with the
gun that Hilshire gave to me?!

52
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,083
So who's the real monster here?

53
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,541
As if you would
ever understand...!

54
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,750
I'm obligated to
fight trash like you!

55
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,541
Likewise, little girl!

56
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,958
Alessio, is the car ready?

57
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,750
Alessio?

58
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:36,291
That's Cristiano. We got him.
Now, put him in the car, Rico.

59
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,500
Yes... Right away.

60
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:50,416
Ferro!

61
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,458
Yes?

62
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,125
Any signs they
have backup coming?

63
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:56,583
Not a chance. We've turned
away all incoming vehicles.

64
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,333
Marco, we have
Cristiano in custody.

65
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,541
We'll be taking
the west road out.

66
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,000
Copy that.

67
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,750
Giorgio... We're at
the gate. You see us?

68
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:10,416
Yes.

69
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,083
Then bring the car.

70
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,625
That's a kid!

71
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,791
Wait...! Franco?!

72
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,208
Rico!

73
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,791
Cristiano, wake up!
Are you all right?!

74
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,416
Get him in the car,
Flanca, now!

75
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:07,041
I guess I should
thank the two of you.

76
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,791
No... We didn't
come here for you...

77
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,000
We came for Pinocchio.

78
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,666
Where is he?!

79
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,125
He's still at the mansion.

80
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,541
Marco, come in.

81
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,083
I'm here.

82
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,541
The target's been abducted.
He's in a red Alfa Romeo.

83
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,500
They'll be to you
any minute now.

84
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,250
Understood...
We'll stop them cold...

85
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,541
Hey... it's time!

86
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,750
I'm ready.

87
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,625
You have a red car
coming. Stop it!

88
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,000
Yes, sir. I understand.

89
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,958
This is stupid...

90
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:55,041
Saving me will only make it
worse on the two of you.

91
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:58,333
Those people will
come after you next.

92
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,375
I thought the only reason
you got into this racket

93
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,875
was to avenge your father.

94
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:10,083
Yes, it was! But right now,
I'm helping the two of you!

95
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:19,750
I cannot just abandon you...

96
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:20,750
Flanc--

97
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,958
Angelica!

98
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,416
Flanca, no...! You have
got to stay with me!

99
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,041
Franco, I'm really cold...

100
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,333
I'm sorry for failing you...

101
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,750
Flanca, slow down. We can't
make the turn at this speed.

102
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,833
You have to slow down!

103
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,875
Hit the brake!

104
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,666
Caterina... You can't die!

105
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,958
Triela!

106
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,666
We pulled the car out
further downstream,

107
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,458
but we haven't found
any bodies yet.

108
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,333
We may have to drag the river.

109
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,583
I see.

110
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,625
We're still searching
the mansion as well...

111
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,208
but it looks like... Cristiano
has disposed of the documents.

112
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,416
He knew we were coming.

113
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,000
Leave the rest to
the Milan branch

114
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:11,458
and get back to headquarters.
I take it no cyborgs were lost?

115
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,708
No, but two were
seriously injuried.

116
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,416
I'll be sending them
back in the chopper,

117
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,000
so we need to have
headquarters prepped

118
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,583
for site-specific replacement.

119
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,541
Triela.

120
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,083
You shouldn't be so reckless.

121
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,041
You've told me that.

122
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,041
I won...

123
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,291
Yeah.

124
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,833
You should praise me...

125
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,375
That's what you do
when someone wins.

126
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,166
Marco...

127
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,208
Are you injured...? If so, then
you should be on the chopper.

128
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,500
I'm fine, but what
about Triela and Rico?

129
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,458
The chopper's taking
them both to headquarters.

130
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,791
Thankfully...

131
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,625
their injuries don't seem
to be life threatening.

132
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,291
I'm happy for them then.

133
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,625
Marco, I have to
tell you something.

134
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:07,958
Yeah?

135
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,875
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

136
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,416
What are you sorry for?

137
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,583
For not being able
to stop the car.

138
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,666
What is with you...?

139
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,000
You're always apologizing,
you know that?

140
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,125
You did a great job, Angelica.

141
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,416
Jean, sir?

142
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,583
We're taking the chopper...
Try not to stand.

143
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,041
Okay.

144
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,833
From the look of it, your
injuries will heal quickly.

145
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:59,083
And then you can get
back to work for me.

146
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,583
Great!

147
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,541
--Really...?
--Yeah.

148
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,250
It was just another dream.

149
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,208
Hey... Triela, there you are!

150
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,500
So, finish with your treatment?

151
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:28,333
They sure did. I was
waiting for you to get done.

152
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,458
So let's walk back together.

153
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,083
Cool...

154
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,958
I'm so glad our bodies
are all fixed up again!

155
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,291
Yeah.

156
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,541
Why aren't you happy?

157
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,583
You beat Pinocchio.
You should be thrilled.

158
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,375
I know.

159
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,041
I'm not as happy
as I expected...

160
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,416
I wonder why that is.

161
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,625
It felt like Pinocchio and
I were similar... somehow.

162
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,416
I don't know.

163
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:33,916
Claes guess what?

164
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,583
Jose told me that Rico and
Triela are coming back today!

165
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,166
Oh... really...?

166
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,000
Isn't that the best
news you've heard?

167
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:43,541
Yes.

168
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,958
I get really lonely
being the only one here.

169
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:49,416
Wait!

170
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,833
What's the matter?

171
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:55,583
I have to go...!
I'm supposed to meet Jose!

172
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,250
I hope you have a good time.

173
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,083
Jose!

174
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,333
I hope I'm not late. Am I?

175
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:17,125
Not at all, Henrietta.
You're right on time.

176
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,166
Are you ready to go?

177
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,583
Yes!

178
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:32,375
What?

179
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,750
Here...
