1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,125
Yes?

2
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,833
Good morning, ma'am.
Sorry it's so early...

3
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:28,916
It's Vincenzo... I'm here
to pick up your husband.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,291
Well good morning, Vinci...

5
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,791
Would you like to
wait inside for him?

6
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:34,208
Thank you, but I think
I'll just wait here.

7
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,333
So, have you gotten the
hang of your new job?

8
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:37,458
Just about.

9
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:38,750
Well, hurry up and
learn so my husband

10
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:42,083
can take a few days off
and relax for a change.

11
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,916
Bruno! Vinci's out
front waiting for you.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,583
Okay.

13
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:51,791
I'll see you after
school, Antonio.

14
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,208
Now, study hard
and make me proud.

15
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,958
So is that all we have on the
books for this month or what?

16
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,666
The guy we have in
back is the last one.

17
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,000
But you are
scheduled for lunch...

18
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,791
You're dining with
Cristiano at 1:30 at Attoria.

19
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,500
I almost forgot.

20
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,250
And while the two of
you are having lunch,

21
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,958
I'll go over to Turin and get
us our next car and number.

22
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,791
You know you're a hell
of a lot more helpful

23
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,041
than I thought you would've
been when you started.

24
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,500
I didn't have a choice but
to pick up things fast...

25
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,375
We don't have a whole
lot of down time.

26
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:05,708
You're right... Business is
booming, but body disposal

27
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,375
isn't the most productive
work we could be doing.

28
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:11,375
If people could just solve their
differences with conversation,

29
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,750
the whole world
could get more done.

30
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,291
If only...

31
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,833
But killing's still the easiest
way to solve a problem.

32
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah... as sad a
statement as that is.

33
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,291
Let me ask you something...

34
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,333
If you have that
much disdain for it,

35
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,333
then why do you do this work?

36
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:33,208
Because you can't support
a family on ideals alone.

37
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,333
We all do the best we can.

38
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,833
I love traveling by train.

39
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,625
Me, too.

40
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,708
I'm real glad you
got better, Angelica.

41
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,250
Angelica?

42
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,208
Yes?

43
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,250
Have you taken
your medication yet?

44
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,500
No, not yet, but I will.

45
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,208
Take it now while there's
still a little time.

46
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:21,125
You brought Angelica with us and
she's still on medication?

47
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,791
She can't kick the
dependency that fast...

48
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,375
The doc prescribed it...

49
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,583
It's just a little something
to help her along...

50
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:30,000
Then you need to be
extra careful on this job.

51
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,833
I don't want any BS.
Keep an eye on her.

52
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,166
Got it.

53
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,666
We'll see you two in a while.

54
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,208
I've got an old contact here I'm
gonna hit up for information.

55
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,083
What about you?

56
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,750
You're going to the police...?

57
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,458
I have an old
underground connection...

58
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,166
I need to find out more
about this "Milan Group."

59
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,833
Then we'll meet you back at the
hotel tonight sometime after 6.

60
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,083
You wait right here
until I get back.

61
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,583
I don't want to bother
with any explanations.

62
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,750
Right.

63
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,333
Inspector Moro...
Someone here to see you, sir.

64
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,083
It's not on my schedule...

65
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,375
Tell whoever it is they'll
have to make an appointment.

66
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,958
I don't think you'll
mind, Inspector.

67
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,333
It's your old friend Marco...

68
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,041
Marco... Toni?

69
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:10,625
Wait, you mean "Leatherhead"
Marco Toni's here?

70
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,375
So what did he mean?

71
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,041
Why'd he call that
guy "Leatherhead"?

72
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,208
National Securities
Operations Service...

73
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,000
known as NOCS for short...

74
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,666
He's an old pro that
used to work here

75
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,750
teaching combat skills.
Guess he's a tough guy...

76
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,000
Marco, my good man!

77
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:36,166
It's been a hell of a long time.

78
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,916
Looks like you're
doing well, Inspector.

79
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,083
I heard you quit because
of your injured eye.

80
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:48,291
That true...? What are you
doing these days anyway?

81
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,708
Just running odd jobs
for the Cabinet Office.

82
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,916
It's work for the braindead.

83
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,708
Pinocchio?

84
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,833
Sorry, but I can't say that
I've ever heard of him.

85
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:07,625
Seems he's been busy killing off
people associated to a trial...

86
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,041
You know, the trial of
that rich guy in Milan.

87
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,291
Ah... I've
heard of that...

88
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,333
The F.R.F. has
way too much power

89
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,208
and influence in this region.

90
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,333
Word around the campfire
is they're greasing

91
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,541
our commissioner's palm so much

92
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,958
we can't conduct any
serious investigations.

93
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,416
Can you give me some
info on anybody...

94
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
Even someone on the bottom rung.

95
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,458
I don't know what you're
really doing here...

96
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,791
and I'm not gonna ask ya.

97
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,666
But I will tell ya, the second
you step outside this station,

98
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,333
open those eyes
in the back of your head.

99
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,625
I wonder if Angelica's working
harder now than before.

100
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,625
You're a curious person.
Some might even say nosy...

101
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,416
Traveling all this way to Milan

102
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,791
on your time off just
to check in on her.

103
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,875
Come on. Like you're
not worried too, Olga.

104
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,375
This is her first time
out in quite a while.

105
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,500
What do you think...?

106
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,375
Has she had enough
time to recover

107
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,125
so she can focus on the work?

108
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,541
I don't know. But I think
leaving Marco and Jean in charge

109
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,916
is a bad idea...
After all Marco's the one--

110
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,916
Hey... What are you
two doing here?

111
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,250
Oh, Buon giorno, Marco.

112
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,375
How-How you doin'...?
Uh, Ciao, Angelica.

113
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:31,166
It's nice to see
you here, Priscilla.

114
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,750
Yeah, we're just here to do a
little shopping on our day off.

115
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,166
You know, girl stuff.

116
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,291
So... Is the job going alright?

117
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,250
Your timing's perfect.
Switch seats with Olga.

118
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,541
Huh?

119
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,708
After I stopped by
the police station,

120
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,958
the "separatists" sent
a tail to keep an eye on me.

121
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,791
He just won't give up.

122
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,875
I can't get anything done.

123
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay Olga...

124
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,708
Let's put those ambassadorial
driving techniques to good use.

125
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,000
Right. Consider it done.

126
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,458
Lost him... Got anything
else you need help with?

127
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,958
As long as you're offering.

128
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,875
I assume you two are armed.
We're gonna need firepower.

129
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,208
We both have our sidearms.

130
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:31,833
Angelica?

131
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,375
Yes, sir.

132
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:37,083
Don't argue, but I want you to
give your case to Priscilla.

133
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:40,458
You're gonna sit this one out
and watch from the sidelines.

134
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,416
No, please, you don't need
to give that thing to me...

135
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,625
Submachine guns really
aren't my thing.

136
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,000
Well, they are now.
Just take it.

137
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,000
This isn't a game.

138
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,041
You've got about
three seconds to tell me

139
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,375
exactly what you know.

140
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,416
Please! We don't know
anything, I swear!

141
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,666
We just run errands for
the rest of 'em!! Really!

142
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,916
But you have to know where
I can find your superiors...

143
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,416
And don't make me ask
the question again...

144
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,375
I start repeating myself and
my trigger finger gets itchy.

145
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,291
Fine I'll talk! I'll talk!

146
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,875
There's an apartment.
Our bosses use it as a base.

147
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,958
Like a safehouse.
That's all I know!

148
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,333
Excellent. Now tell
me where it is.

149
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,500
Angelica!

150
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,208
What are you doing?

151
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,458
Let's get going.

152
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,708
After today, I can
finally take a real break.

153
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:17,000
My son and I are gonna
take a father/son vacation.

154
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,458
With Easter coming up
that should be nice...

155
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:22,250
I want to thank you for all
of your hard work lately.

156
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,083
I know I shouldn't criticize,

157
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,625
but haven't you been
killing a bit much lately?

158
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,416
We follow the flow.
The government started it.

159
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,458
If they would play by the rules,
we wouldn't behave this way.

160
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,958
But they illegally
harass and arrest us.

161
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:38,333
Now they're trying to pass
bills to make that legal.

162
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,500
You mean the revised

163
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,416
Anti-Terrorist Special
Measures Law?

164
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,208
I bet things are just gonna
get uglier after that.

165
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,750
Unfortunately...

166
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:51,083
Milan is poised to become the
Belfast of the 21st Century.

167
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,541
If that happens, you'll have
a decade's long civil war

168
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,125
on your hands that
won't ebb until

169
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,000
both sides are worn
down into the mud.

170
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,458
Do you really want that?

171
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:01,833
Irredeemable fools exist in
all such times in history.

172
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,791
Words mean nothing
to these people.

173
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,041
They understand only action.

174
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,708
When your vacation is over,

175
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,625
I need you to go and
visit with Pinocchio.

176
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,041
I think it would be
best for the boy

177
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,833
if you'd go and
visit him yourself...

178
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,333
He tries to hide it,

179
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,500
but he'd like nothing more
than to see you face to face.

180
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,666
That boy is a grown man now...

181
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,750
This independence is
the best thing for him.

182
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,250
It doesn't matter if the
kid's sixty years old,

183
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,416
a parent is still a parent
until the day they die...

184
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,916
Well... I should be going...

185
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,250
I still need to swing through
Turin to pick up Vinci.

186
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,666
How does it look?

187
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:04,208
The business is registered as
an auto parts subcontractor.

188
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,166
We've only seen people
using the fourth floor.

189
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,541
Every other floor in the
building appears to be empty.

190
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,708
It's obviously a nest,
but there are only

191
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,250
four or five people in
it at any given time...

192
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,916
What's the call, Marco?

193
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,750
Four or five people's
not a problem.

194
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,583
Priscilla, go in
the instrument case

195
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,166
and get out the stun grenades.

196
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,291
I've been carrying
that around in here?!

197
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,458
Of course you've been...!

198
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,750
I told you, this isn't a game!

199
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,291
Whoa.

200
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:44,000
You're not one for
the small talk are you?

201
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,500
Would you rather
I ring the doorbell

202
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,666
and come in for a chat first?

203
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,625
Hey, Priscilla!
The room's clean!

204
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,750
You can come on inside now!

205
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,916
Why don't you and I
stay here, Angelica?

206
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,458
Angelica?

207
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,125
Hey, what's wrong? You okay?

208
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:48,333
You look flushed.
You should get some rest.

209
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,916
Angelica, don't do that.

210
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,291
You're strong. It hurts
when you squeeze that hard.

211
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,041
Okay?

212
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,458
Let go, Angelica.

213
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,083
Please...

214
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,625
Hey...

215
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,083
Angelica!

216
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,375
Marco...! Help...

217
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,958
Help how...? What's wrong?!

218
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:18,291
I need to take my pills.
I need my medication. Now!

219
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,333
Is it her dependency?

220
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,041
I don't know.

221
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,458
She's been taking what
the doctor gave her, but...

222
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,875
I just don't know
if it's helping her.

223
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,208
Hey Olga...

224
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,125
Take those guys downstairs
and throw them in the car...

225
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,500
Got it.

226
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,541
Marco...

227
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,625
She didn't hurt you, did she?

228
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,708
Marco, you have
to listen to me...

229
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,916
You can't tell
Jean about Angelica.

230
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,958
What?

231
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,791
If he hears about this,
she'll be hospitalized again.

232
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:06,666
I just feel so bad for her.
She hasn't done anything wrong.

233
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,333
We're the ones to blame here.

234
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:14,708
Not one of these girls
deserves what they get...

235
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,958
It's on us...
every last bit of it.

236
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,458
She seems fine.

237
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,916
I think it was just the anxiety

238
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,541
of her first real
action in a while.

239
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,666
If she wakes up without
any more problems,

240
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,958
I want you to give her a gun.

241
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,458
That should help
calm her nerves.

242
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,041
What do we do now?

243
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:41,625
We torture the captives until
they give up their superiors.

244
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:45,791
We'll call for help from Rome
and clean house before dawn.

245
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,416
Sounds good to me.

246
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,833
I hear Pricialla ended up with
a broken arm when it was over.

247
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,333
Yeah, she did.

248
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,958
But I gotta say, she took
it all like a real trooper...

249
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,958
That girl is a lot stronger
than you think she is, Marco.

250
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,666
She claims all her strength
comes from the "power of love."

251
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,083
Funny...

252
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,083
I guess at the end of the day,
she's just a dreamer...

253
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,416
I don't know.
She told me herself one day...

254
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,250
"Angelica has
turned out this way

255
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,083
because Marco lacks
any ability to love."

256
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,875
What's the hell is
that supposed to mean?

257
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,375
This is the young things
first job in a long time.

258
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,708
You should try to be
nice to her, at least.

259
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,041
It's easy for you to say that

260
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,625
when you're looking
in from the outside.

261
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,250
Priscilla did all she
could to stop Angelica.

262
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,250
She kept telling
her it hurt, but,

263
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:34,333
Angelica only snapped out of it
when she heard your voice...

264
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:37,291
You should let that sink in.

265
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,166
Wow, what a waste. Fainting
on a big trip like this.

266
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,541
I'm really sorry
that happened to you.

267
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,791
No... It's okay...

268
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:55,625
Marco has been extra nice
to me since it all happened.

269
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,666
Rico... Could I ask you a favor?

270
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,458
Sure, what is it?

271
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:09,166
Will you let me kill one
of the bad guys tomorrow?

272
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,666
Of course. It'd be my pleasure.

273
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,625
Why the hell do they
need us at the factory?

274
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,750
This is entirely too
far out of the way.

275
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:38,791
Well, you know they must have

276
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,500
screwed something
up once again...

277
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,333
These guys can't seem
to get anything right

278
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,333
the first time around.

279
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,625
That's true...

280
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,208
I guess you finally
earned the right to talk.

281
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:01,166
This is Tifosi to Mahdena 01.

282
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,541
We've acquired target heading
south on the Viale Italia.

283
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,750
Contact with 01 in 20 seconds.

284
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:10,708
No civilian traffic
within 200 meters.

285
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,208
So are you still seeing
that French woman?

286
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,708
I forget what her name was...

287
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,250
Her name's Aline, and yes...

288
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,958
We've been together a while now.

289
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,833
I never saw what was so
great about French women.

290
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:24,250
You should stick with a healthy
Italian woman from Milan.

291
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:28,708
Modena 01 to 04 and 05...
Are you ready to move?

292
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,500
Yeah.

293
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,833
We're a go here, Jean.

294
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,083
Now, I want you to listen...

295
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:38,625
Promise me you'll do it just
like you did in training.

296
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,625
I don't want you killing anyone.

297
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,000
Yes, sir.

298
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,791
That was way too close for me.

299
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,958
Vinchi! Keep your head down!

300
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,500
The car's armored.

301
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,875
Angelica...

302
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,583
Uh, yes sir?

303
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,083
Tell me...

304
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,500
Are you feeling all right
after all that just happened?

305
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,125
I'm fine.

306
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:15,208
But I'm so sorry I failed you...
I didn't mean to, Marco.

307
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,500
It was an armored Ferrari.

308
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,083
There's not much
you could've done.

309
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,625
But... you moved fast

310
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,916
and you hit everything
you were aiming for...

311
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,125
You did a great job today.

312
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,041
No way...

313
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:53,583
Please tell me I'm
having a bad dream...

314
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,875
This is such a
fucked up... world.

315
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:03,666
Rico!

316
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:10,750
I'm sorry about the
way this turned out...

317
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:13,750
I didn't mean to break
my promise to you.

318
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:14,958
No, it's okay...

319
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:17,166
When it was over,
Marco was happy...

320
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,791
He said that I did a great job!

321
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:22,708
That's great. I'm really
happy for you Angelica.
