1
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,875
The ocean sure is big.

2
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,791
It's enormous.

3
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,166
Jean told me something.

4
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,208
He said that every time
he looked at the ocean

5
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,250
it makes him feel sad.

6
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:57,166
What about you, Henrietta?
What do you feel?

7
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:02,000
I guess... I guess it
makes me miss Jose.

8
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:06,083
Yeah, you're right.
'Cause it makes me miss Jean.

9
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,250
Look!

10
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,458
I heard the other
day they're gonna

11
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:29,041
demolish the survey bridge.

12
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,750
Too bad... after all
we did to protect it.

13
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:44,000
They're also restarting
construction on the real bridge.

14
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:47,000
It should happen
sometime over the next month.

15
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,458
How's Triela been lately?

16
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:59,208
In the dorm.
How's she been doing?

17
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:02,750
Her injuries from
Milan were pretty bad.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,125
Maybe that's why she
hasn't been very cheerful

19
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,250
since she's been back.

20
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:27,958
Triela...
Is something the matter?

21
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:31,791
What...? No...
Nothing's wrong at all.

22
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,333
You're not feeling
sick, are you?

23
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,500
Trust me. I'm fine.

24
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,625
So, are you still feeling off?

25
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:57,666
I think most of the drugs'
side effects have worn off...

26
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,291
I think.

27
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:06,625
But I still don't feel any
better, even after I've won.

28
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:12,166
And that's what I wanted
more than anything.

29
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,583
May you not chase the
events of times past...

30
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:28,166
nor vex over the future
and what it may hold.

31
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,250
Don't worry about
what's happened...

32
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,333
and don't be concerned
with what's going to happen.

33
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,375
You've got a nice,
simple philosophy, Claes.

34
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:49,291
Actually... I think
it's our philosophy.

35
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,291
You know Triela...

36
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,333
You probably should
have gone with them.

37
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,000
Maybe...

38
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:04,125
It was Taormina.
That's in Sicily, right?

39
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,708
Yeah...

40
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,250
Jean, mentioned that they have
a villa outside of town there.

41
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,833
Oh.

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,708
I guess it doesn't
really matter,

43
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,208
just as long as Henrietta
and Rico have a good time.

44
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:02,750
I wish... I wish you and I could
always be together, Jose.

45
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,833
Oh yeah? Why's that?

46
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,500
Father is always too
busy with his work,

47
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,791
and you know Jean will
be late to everything.

48
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,041
I thought the whole
point of a vacation

49
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:19,250
is to get to spend
time with your family.

50
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,666
Yeah, I'm sorry...

51
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,666
Whenever I start to feel lonely,

52
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,875
I know that you're the
only one I can count on

53
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,083
to be there for me.

54
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,458
Jose?

55
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,541
Hilshire called...
The ferry's here.

56
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,833
It's docked on the
other side of the island.

57
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,375
Okay.

58
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:15,041
It's too bad we've only got
a few hours of relaxation left.

59
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,291
It is kind of short to
call it a real vacation...

60
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,666
But that's how it always is.

61
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,000
Do you remember
when we were kids--

62
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,833
that time we spent an
entire month up here...?

63
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,583
Everyone was always so busy.

64
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,875
I got an idea.

65
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:31,625
Yeah?

66
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,250
The old amphitheater--

67
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,458
let's go there...
just for old times' sake.

68
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,708
This place sure does
bring back memories.

69
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,666
We used to run around
here like crazy.

70
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,125
But, Jose.

71
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,583
I come to this city,
I see one thing...

72
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,958
Every member of
our family, dead...

73
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:05,041
That's the only thing I can
ever think of when I'm here.

74
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,583
I know.

75
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,416
And it doesn't bother you?

76
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,000
It's gotta stir up
memories of Enrica.

77
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,583
You don't get it, brother.

78
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,666
I come here to make
sure that no matter what

79
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,458
I never forget about her.

80
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:23,541
And it helps... Helps me know
how to treat Henrietta well.

81
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,458
It's changed.

82
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,375
What has?

83
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:38,000
Your attitude...
toward Henrietta, I mean.

84
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,458
You've put some of your
baggage behind you...

85
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,375
You're just more
natural with her now.

86
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:47,250
If I recall, you were the one
against doting over her. No?

87
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,708
Look, you didn't have
it in you last year.

88
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,791
You do now. Let's not
make a thing out of it.

89
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:55,500
I'm always open to any
prudent method of interaction.

90
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,500
'Course you are.

91
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:13,750
I hope the girls are
enjoying their down time.

92
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:17,333
Cyborg conditioning is mentally
stressful to an alarming degree.

93
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,250
I want to see if
this kind of time off

94
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,250
could help stem the problem.

95
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,375
I heard about the
second-stage girl.

96
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,041
How's she coming along so far?

97
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,041
You mean with the
new conditioning system?

98
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,250
They're lowering the dosages

99
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,083
and easing up on the
restraints, right?

100
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,375
I think it a good idea.

101
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,958
Reduce the load and
you get more mileage.

102
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,375
The chief has
high hopes for her.

103
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,250
Jose!

104
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,250
Hi, Henrietta.

105
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,833
These past few days
without you felt like forever.

106
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:15,041
I guess I missed you more
than I thought I would.

107
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,083
Hilshire... Thanks for
watching out for them.

108
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,833
They needed a good guide.

109
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,708
Well, It's all just part of
the Handler's job description.

110
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,291
What now...? Are you gonna
come stay at our place?

111
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,791
Nah, I'm taking a plane back...

112
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,416
I left Triela alone
at headquarters.

113
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,958
Sure. I know exactly
how you feel.

114
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,125
Have a good trip back.

115
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,250
Hello Jean... How are you?

116
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,416
I'm glad you're here...

117
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,666
This is a rare vacation...
so have a good time.

118
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,208
'Kay.

119
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,166
That's amazing!

120
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,041
I know.

121
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,791
I wonder if I'll have
to give up my gun again,

122
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,208
like I did last year?

123
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,791
Henrietta.

124
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,958
Jose...

125
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,833
We're going out for
dinner in the city tonight.

126
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:05,541
What do you say?

127
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,291
Great.

128
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,541
Uh... Um...

129
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:18,416
Here you go... Take my gun.

130
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,125
Oh, right... I forgot.

131
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,458
You told me before we left...

132
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,500
that I should try to be normal.

133
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,875
Like a normal girl,
on a normal vacation.

134
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:33,125
No... I want you to keep it.

135
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,833
Oh... Sure!

136
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:39,916
Now then...
Check inside that closet.

137
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,208
'Kay.

138
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,041
It's so cute!

139
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,750
Go ahead. Try it on.

140
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,083
Thank you so much, Jose!

141
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,083
What's that, Henrietta?
A new dress?

142
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,666
Isn't it nice?

143
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,625
That, outfit...

144
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:56,583
Um... It was Jose.
He was letting me borrow it.

145
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,458
Are you alright, Jean?

146
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:05,833
Yeah... I'm good, thanks.
Jose is getting the car.

147
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,500
Okay!

148
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,708
Rico couldn't wait
to come here either!

149
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,791
She was packed three
days before we left.

150
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,000
Any ideas about what we
should we do tomorrow?

151
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,750
Sightseeing and
shopping are about it...

152
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,083
There's really not
much else to do here.

153
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,250
Let's see the ocean!

154
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,458
I mean... please.

155
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,000
Okay... We will.

156
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,625
Cool.

157
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,416
Jean...! You're not
leaving already?!

158
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,958
Mountain training is beginning.

159
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,750
I need to return to Rome
before they head out.

160
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,166
But you can't...

161
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,625
We're all finally together
like we're supposed to be.

162
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,333
Besides you promised
the three of us

163
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,083
would go sailing this year!

164
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:59,250
You can't just leave and
break your promise to me!

165
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,166
Don't act so childish.

166
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,125
You can just go
with Jose tomorrow.

167
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,916
Those were Enrica's clothes...

168
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:40,041
You took this one
too far, Jose. Too far.

169
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,375
Did he really?

170
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,291
Enrica...

171
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,458
You're both my brothers...

172
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:04,125
but Jose is the only one
who tries to remember me.

173
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,958
I'm seeing things...
I have to be.

174
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,791
But you, my dear Jean...

175
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,541
Well, you're just
terrible to me.

176
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:35,000
I haven't forgotten you!

177
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,000
Your heart is filled
with the desire

178
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,666
to avenge what
happened to Sofia.

179
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:47,000
But Jose is terrible
in his own way, too.

180
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,500
Of course those clothes
do belong to me...

181
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,250
But he's letting
another girl wear them.

182
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,750
Now that I'm dead,

183
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:06,708
Jose has found a perfect
replacement for me.

184
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:07,791
That's right!

185
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,083
He's apologizing Enrica!

186
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,333
He thinks if he can
do everything for her,

187
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,916
then you might be
able to forgive him.

188
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,041
That's not for me...

189
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,625
He's doing that for himself.

190
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,208
What's wrong with that?!

191
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:27,250
The only thing the dead have is
the ability to curse the living.

192
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,208
Because you see
the living as weak!

193
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,291
He tried everything...

194
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:38,458
This was the only way Jose 
could have lived with himself!

195
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,291
I was the one who suggested it!

196
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,250
Put the blame on my shoulders!

197
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,583
Jean?

198
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,375
Is someone out there with you?

199
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,583
It's just me.

200
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,625
What's wrong, Rico?

201
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:21,500
I had a bad feeling...
so I thought I'd look for you.

202
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:22,708
and when I heard your voice

203
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:26,041
it sounded like you were
angry with somebody.

204
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,166
I'm fine.

205
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,916
The stars are gorgeous tonight.

206
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,750
Yeah, they look a lot
different than they do

207
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,125
back at headquarters don't they?

208
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,500
It would have been nice to have 
brought the telescope with us.

209
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,291
Then you could have
told me some more of your

210
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,875
star stories that
I enjoy so much.

211
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,833
I don't need the telescope
to tell you stories.

212
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,750
What's wrong?

213
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,541
It's Rico, she told
me something...

214
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:38,375
On the ferry... she said that
the ocean makes Jean feel sad.

215
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:51,041
It makes me lonely...
and uneasy.

216
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:04,125
There's no need to be...
I'm right here.

217
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,333
Yeah... I don't have
any problems...

218
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,166
...when I'm with you.

219
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,041
Jose?

220
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:07,125
Last night... I saw
an illusion of Enrica.

221
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,166
An illusion?

222
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:17,250
I don't know, maybe.
It could have been a ghost.

223
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,833
Really?

224
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:26,125
She scolded me... got me
feeling bad about things.

225
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Jose, come in the water!

226
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:33,041
It's been a while since
we've gone swimming.

227
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,083
Let's hop in.

228
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,416
Sure.

229
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:49,000
Do you remember... the last 
time we were all here...

230
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,791
we promised to
take Enrica sailing?

231
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,666
Of course, I remember.
You couldn't stay.

232
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,333
Had to go back to
Rome for training.

233
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,791
What would you say to
taking the boat out later?

234
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:04,375
Just you and me and the girls.

235
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:07,500
Sounds great...
Yeah. Let's do that.
