1
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,458
Caterina! You're here!

2
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:59,458
Domenico! Paola...!
It's been a long time.

3
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,791
How many years has it been...?

4
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,833
I was so thrilled to hear
your dear voice on the phone...

5
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,833
Sorry to give you
so little notice...

6
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,958
But my friends and I need
to stay here for a while.

7
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,291
Oh, certainly!

8
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,333
You kids make
yourselves right at home.

9
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,791
Listen, Franco... I just...

10
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,083
I wanna say thanks
for taking care of her.

11
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,833
No need... It's the
other way around.

12
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,708
She takes care of me.

13
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,583
This is Pinocchio...

14
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,500
He'll be working with
Flanca and me for a while.

15
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,958
It's very nice to meet you.

16
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,125
Where are we?

17
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,541
Flanca's vineyard.

18
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,041
That couple you just met,

19
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,958
they're in charge of
running the place.

20
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,125
They make a pretty
fantastic white wine here.

21
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,875
I've never been
a big fan of wine.

22
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,458
Most likely, it was the
same Social Welfare Agency

23
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,166
you ran into in Montalcino.

24
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,375
They're hindering our activities
all around the country.

25
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,875
We're at my vineyard...

26
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,541
We should be safe
here for now, so...

27
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:08,875
I think we'll set up shop

28
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,458
and plan out the
bridge bombing here.

29
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,875
Fine, you do that.

30
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,666
But if anything happens,
you call the usual number.

31
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,000
Right. Well, do you want
to talk to Pinocchio?

32
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,083
No, that's alright.

33
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,458
I'll just leave him
in your capable hands.

34
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,083
Oh, One more thing...

35
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,625
I was curious about
that pendant he wears...

36
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,125
Is it very important to him?

37
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,208
It's something I gave
to him a long time ago.

38
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,041
Oh.

39
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,375
You should know...

40
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,791
We have a kidnapping plan
underway in Rome now...

41
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,083
The chairwoman of the

42
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,666
Messina Bridge
Development Corporation...

43
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,083
The success or failure of this
will change some future plans.

44
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,666
Yeah, I bet.

45
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,250
The operation is being led by
someone you may have met before.

46
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,583
From Bergamo. Nino Ferretti.

47
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,250
Nino?

48
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:15,166
There it is.
The chairwoman's car.

49
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,541
Looks like there's no
escort with her today...

50
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,750
Good.

51
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,375
That lady gets more
naïve by the day...

52
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,291
Tell Cosimo and Corra to follow
her no matter where she goes.

53
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,833
Leone.

54
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,750
I just talked with Sergio...

55
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,875
he said her security detail
is being replaced soon...

56
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:33,333
We need to keep our guard up
until we know who they are.

57
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,916
Come on, Nino.

58
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,208
Don't you think we need to be
a little more proactive here?

59
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,333
I don't think there's
anything more proactive

60
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,208
than being careful.

61
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,083
Uh, that's the end.

62
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,583
Thank you, young lady...

63
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,500
That was the
loveliest performance.

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,041
You see...?

65
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,208
She appears as any
ordinary schoolgirl.

66
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,750
Truly, I'm in shock.
That girl has a mechanical body?

67
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,041
We use medical
reconstruction techniques

68
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,750
and new industrial
technologies

69
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,333
in order to fashion
the most lifelike being.

70
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,208
Their skin, bones, and muscles

71
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,625
are made of revolutionary
new materials.

72
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,500
It doesn't make
them 'superhuman',

73
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,875
but they're stronger and
quicker than the average person,

74
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,000
and they obey orders
unquestionably.

75
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:56,000
But still, there's the moral
issue of using children.

76
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,083
Unfortunately, the
younger the patient,

77
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,208
the more adaptable the brain.

78
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:03,666
Isabella. We should
only focus on one thing here.

79
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,958
Our national security is key...

80
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:09,208
That is how we maintain
society's peace of mind.

81
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,083
I don't have the
kind of background

82
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,291
in public safety that you do...

83
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,250
This is difficult
for me to accept...

84
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,583
Chairwoman...

85
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,083
Our medical reconstruction
techniques are the best,

86
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,541
the most advanced in the world.

87
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,125
The state of the
art in science...

88
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,500
The reason for this is
that our cybernetic research

89
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,916
also benefits society
as a whole...

90
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,166
Currently, we provide hundreds
of patients around the country

91
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,208
with artificial limbs
at no cost to them.

92
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,083
And I promise you
that it won't be long

93
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:40,916
until we develop the same kind
of treatment for you legs.

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,208
I sympathize with the
children's plight, I do.

95
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:49,041
But just think of how many more
can be saved because of them.

96
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,583
We're still running
background checks

97
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,333
on everyone close
to the chairwoman.

98
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,791
Should be done in a few days.

99
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,375
That Padania agent that
we caught the other day...

100
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,291
He talked. He said that the
kidnapping is imminent...

101
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,791
So lets hurry things up.

102
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,583
It's my top priority.

103
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,125
Jose!

104
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:10,166
Hi, Henrietta. That
was a very nice performance.

105
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,250
You're getting better.

106
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,125
I practice every day.

107
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,458
Hey, Henrietta...
What's that thing?

108
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:40,541
A kaleidoscope. Jose got
it for me when he was in France.

109
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,833
Is it like a fancy gun scope?

110
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,791
Come here, see for yourself.

111
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:51,625
Turn this wheel to
change the colors.

112
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,666
Pretty...

113
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,750
Rico... what did you do?

114
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,625
Oh, I'm sorry, Henrietta.

115
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,250
Why did you turn
the wheel so hard?!

116
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:22,041
Henrietta, did you say
something mean to Rico?

117
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:27,791
She didn't mean to break it, so
you need to forgive her, okay?

118
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,291
I'm the one to blame,
if anybody.

119
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,083
Lousy antique shop owner...

120
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:35,208
Jose... No, you didn't
do anything wrong.

121
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,333
I'm going to get
it repaired... but...

122
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,375
afterwards you need
to make up with Rico.

123
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,625
Hey... Show me a
smile there, would ya?

124
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,625
Yes, sir...

125
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,625
Ludovico here.

126
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,833
Still no change at the
chairwoman's estate.

127
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,000
How can I help you?

128
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,375
Someone told me I could get
an antique repaired here.

129
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,541
Is that right?

130
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,583
Sure. We can fix
almost anything.

131
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,958
So, what do you have?

132
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:14,833
Interesting.

133
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,000
You don't see this kind of
kaleidoscope every day.

134
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,500
My hands are pretty full...

135
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,625
so it might take some time
to get to it, but I'll fix it.

136
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:21,833
Is that okay?

137
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,375
I guess it'll have to do.

138
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:32,583
Forget about it... I'll have
it done in three days.

139
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,583
Hired hands like me get
stuck in a rut sometimes...

140
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,583
We need to be reminded
our job's worthwhile.

141
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:42,750
Besides, I can't let
the girl get more upset.

142
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,541
One mundane afternoon,
a teary-eyed girl

143
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,791
showed up with a
broken kaleidoscope.

144
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,666
She had the faintest
but distinct scent

145
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,166
of pine resin to her.

146
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,833
The kind of resin that is
probably used on violin bows.

147
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,958
There's just such a sense of
drama to it, you know...?

148
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:04,291
Jobs like that are
the ones that I love.

149
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,416
How's the security issue
look to you, Alfonso?

150
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,625
The bulletproof exterior
is going to work just fine.

151
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,791
Inside... we'll turn
off the drivers side airbag

152
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,375
and then install some
kind of fire extinguisher.

153
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:22,875
Sounds good.

154
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,458
Well, I'm here. I thought you
had everything you needed.

155
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,708
Tell me, Kaschmann...
Why doesn't she bring

156
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,916
any escorts with her
when she's on the move?

157
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,500
She considers, the excessive
security unnecessary.

158
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,458
That seems a little odd...

159
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,000
Her husband died in
a terrorist attack.

160
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,416
So then... Is there
anything else I can do

161
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,916
to help you out
with all of this?

162
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,500
No, thank you.

163
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,000
We'll handle the entire
operation from here...

164
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,666
Notify the mansion's
security staff

165
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,958
that they're on
vacation as of now.

166
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,708
Oh, thank you, Henrietta.

167
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,625
It looks as if you're starting
a war from this room.

168
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,958
Ms. D'Angelo...

169
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,625
The Five Republics Faction
is out to kill you...

170
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,416
All these weapons are to
prevent that from hapenning.

171
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Yes, I'm aware of that.

172
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,541
If the sight of all this
is too much for you,

173
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,375
I recommend you
close your eyes...

174
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:47,541
Like it or not, ma'am,
this is our job...

175
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,333
I know... And I'm sorry.

176
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,666
I think I made him angry.

177
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,083
Jose... I only
realized it now...

178
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:04,500
It's because of what happened
to his family years ago.

179
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,041
It's scary...

180
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:09,000
As if I could see the color
of hatred boiling inside him...

181
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,083
Jose is a nice person!

182
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,500
Yesterday, even though he
was overloaded with work,

183
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,291
he still made time to take me
to have my kaleidoscope fixed!

184
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,375
There's not a person
in the entire country

185
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,791
who's as nice as Jose!

186
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:25,583
Is that so...? Then I apoligize.

187
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:29,000
His hatred must have only
changed him quietly,

188
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,791
on the inside.

189
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:35,083
Ms D'Angelo... Don't you hate
terrorists like everyone else?

190
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,958
I suppose I did a
long, long time ago...

191
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,625
And what about you, dear?

192
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,250
It's not exactly hate...

193
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,625
I just have a good
reason to kill them.

194
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:47,125
It's because...
That's exactly what Jose wants.

195
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,750
I've lost my certainty...

196
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,750
I wanted to fulfill
my husband's wish...

197
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,916
But I don't know if
finishing the bridge

198
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,041
is worth any of this...

199
00:13:56,125 --> 00:14:01,375
Is it worth it to shed this much
blood over any mere project?

200
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,291
Nino.

201
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,208
Don't tell me you've fixed
the kaleidoscope already.

202
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,666
Yeah...

203
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,583
The spindle broke off, so I
just whipped up a new one.

204
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:15,333
Oh...? Pretty slick, genius.
Where'd you learn that one?

205
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,125
I used to tinker with
these kinds of things

206
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:20,208
back when I was a kid.
Take a look at this down here.

207
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,750
It's fascinating stuff.

208
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,875
You're screwing with me.
This says 'Balzac' on it.

209
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,041
"Lily of the Valley", 1836.

210
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,791
May be a worthless knock off,
but it's nicely-done.

211
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah.

212
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,833
Does the client know
it's a piece of junk?

213
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,666
I'm pretty sure he does... Yeah.

214
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,625
He seemed like he could
appreciate a good joke.

215
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,916
With a gift like this...

216
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,416
it's the thought that
matters most of all.

217
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,583
Flanca...

218
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,916
I've heard stories about
you recent exploits.

219
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,833
And how is Franco doing?

220
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,166
Fine.

221
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,583
To be honest, I never
thought he would be up to

222
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,500
handling any
woman for long...

223
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,458
I guess in the end I
was wrong about the guy.

224
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,083
I talked to Cristiano
the other day...

225
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:31,083
Don't tell me you've really
given up bomb-making?

226
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,083
But I have.

227
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,375
Because there's a little job

228
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,125
where I could use
your assistance. With you--

229
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,333
The Messina Bridge. I know.

230
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,041
You want the passion
of the planners

231
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,791
to match the size of the job.

232
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,708
Something that
big'll take a lot.

233
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,458
You have enough by yourself.

234
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,708
But you...

235
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,000
I thought you're in this
to avenge your brother.

236
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,250
I used to be...

237
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,833
Hey, you know what the
guys in the business

238
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,625
call me these days...?

239
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:55,708
They call me the Tibetan Terrier
that can no longer run.

240
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,791
I'll be in Rome for
the next few days.

241
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,083
Call me if you change your mind.

242
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:22,708
Whatcha see Nino?

243
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,791
Who's the little girl
in the backseat?

244
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,875
According to Sergio,
she's a relative of D'Angelo...

245
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,875
She's visiting Rome on vacation.

246
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,500
Is that right?

247
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,708
Yeah?

248
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,333
Nino.

249
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,833
The authorities caught him.
Our associate at the magazine.

250
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,875
I see... Well... now
it's only a matter of time

251
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,750
before they learn
about this kidnapping.

252
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:51,666
What do you think? Should we
do it first thing in the A.M.?

253
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,375
The plan's off, Leone.

254
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,708
What do you mean?!

255
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,333
The man... the one who
just got out of the car...

256
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,083
I know who he is.

257
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,416
He's sharp.

258
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,416
He used to be part of
the Ministry of Interior's

259
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,583
anti-terrorism unit.

260
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,000
The risk is too high.
We're done here...

261
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,125
Go gather the others.

262
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,458
This is bullshit.

263
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,000
If we had moved sooner,
we'd be past all this!

264
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:30,000
Why do you think that Milan
chose Nino instead of you?!

265
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:33,750
Because he's cautious and he
hates any unnecessary bloodshed.

266
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:37,625
Leone... You and Nino go
pretty far back, don't you?

267
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,916
The first time he and I met...
he was only a young student

268
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,833
at the Turin
Polytechnic Labratories.

269
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,833
He and his brother would craft

270
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,916
the most creative bombs,
blowing things up at random.

271
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,375
Still, he was a reliable friend.

272
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,458
Is that so...

273
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,375
But after the police
killed his brother,

274
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,291
something in him changed.
He grew more timid.

275
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:06,250
Those around him even started
calling him the Tibetan Terrier.

276
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,000
Tibetan Terrier?

277
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,708
It's an ornamental
dog from Tibet.

278
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,916
Like a Lhasa Apso.
Alert and agile, but docile.

279
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,458
I don't understand...
We're all capable adults.

280
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,166
Why don't we kill her ourselves?

281
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,625
I'm considering that.

282
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,541
We have no need
for cowards here.

283
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,708
Everything okay, Kaschmann?

284
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,583
I thought you were supposed
to be going on vacation?

285
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,375
Five years I've been in
charge of her security...

286
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,958
I get the feeling...

287
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:43,250
I wouldn't know what do with
myself out there all alone.

288
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,166
Who's the little girl you got
pushing Ms. D'Angelo around?

289
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,625
She's one of the chairwoman's
relatives, in from Padua.

290
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:50,833
Well, that's strange.

291
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,458
Cuz in five years I
haven't heard one thing

292
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,000
about any relatives from Padua.

293
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,916
I can't imagine you'd care
about her family, Kaschmann...

294
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,083
or should I call
you Sergio Aimaro?!

295
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,333
We had our guys run
background checks...

296
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,708
We knew everything about
you before we got here.

297
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,875
After tapping every phone line,
inspecting every bank account,

298
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,416
and scouring all the public
records we could dig up...

299
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,875
we learned that you're
actually a Padania agent

300
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:18,541
who's changed his name and
his face two times so far.

301
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,208
At least now we don't
have to smoke him out...

302
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:32,500
Ferro. We'll use him
for the decoy operation.

303
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,000
Understood.

304
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,250
According to Sergio,

305
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,541
we've got ten minutes
until the chairwoman's car

306
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,750
pulls up to the steps
of the church.

307
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,708
Of course, she doesn't
have the use of her legs,

308
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,791
so she'll be the most vulnerable
as she's exiting the vehicle.

309
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,916
The focus is on kidnapping
the chairwoman and the girl.

310
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,541
Kill all the escorts.

311
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,083
Dammit!

312
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,458
Now! Move in!

313
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:17,083
Rico... You shouldn't
have fired the second round.

314
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:20,083
Right... I'm sorry
for that, Jean.

315
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,916
I can't go on as an
activist any longer.

316
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,625
Ever since my brother died...

317
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,000
I keep asking myself
the same question...

318
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,333
I keep asking myself
if what we're doing

319
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,625
is truly worth killing
over... I don't know.

320
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,166
Nino...

321
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,500
There used to be a time when

322
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,666
I wouldn't have given
it a second thought.

323
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,166
I don't like this.

324
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,541
I can't imagine you would. 

325
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,458
But someday... you'll get it.

326
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,125
How can you be so sure?

327
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:21,458
Flanca, what is it
you're fighting against?

328
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:25,166
Do you even know when
victory will be yours?

329
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,750
If you're in this to
avenge your old man...

330
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:32,291
How many people have to
die to set things right?

331
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:35,125
Think that over now, while
you've still got the time.

332
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,458
Don't wait until you're
an old dog like me

333
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:40,500
who doesn't have it in him
to keep running anymore.

334
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,666
What do you think?
Looks good all fixed up.

335
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,375
Maybe even better than
when you brought it in.

336
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,291
Now, young lady...

337
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,625
Make sure you oil
that thing regularly.

338
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:53,541
Okay!

339
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,916
Uh, sir... The
gentleman who repaired this,

340
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,875
does he happen to
be working today?

341
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,541
I'd really like to thank him.

342
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:00,875
Oh...

343
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:03,583
Sorry- Nino quit when he
finished the kalediscope.

344
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:07,333
He was very talented and
I hated seeing him go.
