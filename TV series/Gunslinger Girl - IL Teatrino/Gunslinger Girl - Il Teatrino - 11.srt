1
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,791
Cristiano, it's me...

2
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,875
The job's done.
They've been taken care of...

3
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,833
The count is three men...
and one woman.

4
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:45,666
Wrong. The count is
four men and one woman.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,375
And that would be, four.

6
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:57,416
Count the bodies again.
I'll be there shortly.

7
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,958
I've had the Polacco
family eradicated.

8
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:10,000
Indeed. Your work is always
so quick and precise.

9
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:12,333
I have high hopes
for your future.

10
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,833
Well, thank you for
your confidence, sir.

11
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:18,583
John Doe... We're leaving.

12
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,291
You know, if you would
give up the drink,

13
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,833
I'd be willing to
double your wages.

14
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:27,708
Except that drinking... is
the one thing I insist upon.

15
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,500
You sly devil...

16
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:38,666
When did you put
this in here, Polacco?

17
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,916
He's alive, I take it?

18
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,958
Yeah, he is.

19
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,958
Is he another one
of Polacco's kids?

20
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,958
Not if he's like this.

21
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,750
Then what do we do?

22
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,333
You wanna just leave him?

23
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:45,125
No, he comes with us...
Bring the car around back.

24
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,541
Kid... Come on out.

25
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,291
I see.

26
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:08,166
Of course... Understood.

27
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:22,375
Alessio... Any word on
how Pinocchio is doing?

28
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,041
As per your instructions...

29
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:27,625
he is still on standby at
Flanca's vineyard in Tuscany.

30
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,500
That's good.

31
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,250
Is there something
bothering you sir?

32
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:37,583
It's nothing...
Don't worry about it.

33
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:50,166
Hey, Pinocchio...!
You out there?!

34
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,166
Yeah, what do
you need, Domenico?

35
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,291
We should be heading back
soon. It's about lunchtime.

36
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,125
I'm ready now!

37
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,500
You've really transformed
into a ripe ol' farmer

38
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,458
these past few months!

39
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,208
You think so?

40
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,291
I've never seen
such a green thumb

41
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,791
on such a green kid before.

42
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,375
That's funny...

43
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:16,666
I had actually never even
thought about it until now.

44
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,458
While you're still
a young man...

45
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,958
You should try all
sorts of things.

46
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,458
Pino...

47
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,625
Did you go into the fields
again this morning?

48
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,708
Yeah, I sure did.

49
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:35,500
Good...! So tell me have
you seen Franco around?

50
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,458
Wouldn't he be in Flanca's room?

51
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:40,458
You think the two of them
are lovers too, don't you...?

52
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,958
I've thought they
seemed unusually close.

53
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,333
Who knows.

54
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:48,833
He may be gloomy...
but, he's cute.

55
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,500
Do you have a girlfriend?

56
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:55,333
I've never been
very good with girls.

57
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,458
So now we have
it calculated out.

58
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,666
Explosives delivery... was
being arranged by Cristiano.

59
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,750
But I think it's too late.

60
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,458
I heard the military's
illegal sales have stopped.

61
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,125
You think we'll be alright?

62
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,541
I don't know... The weapons
procurement route

63
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,125
the Milan group used
was busted the other day.

64
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:15,166
I guess we'll be stranded
here a little longer.

65
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:20,375
That'll just force Pinocchio to
have to mellow out even more.

66
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,833
I think it's probably
for the best.

67
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,208
Huh?

68
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,375
Don't you think so?

69
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,416
Yeah, I do... Who knows...

70
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,291
Maybe we'll be able to
just live our lives here...

71
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,333
Forget all of the
fighting and the hatred

72
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,875
swirling about in the world.

73
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,125
Mentally, Pinocchio's
still a child.

74
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,958
His emotions have been
frozen for so long,

75
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,791
but I've been seeing him
thaw out at this place.

76
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,125
I think he'll be able to change.

77
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:56,041
But... It may be
too late for me.

78
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:59,208
Franco... you think I'm
being obstinate, don't you?

79
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,791
But doesn't that
take courage too?

80
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,125
There's nothing wrong
with being obstinate...

81
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:08,458
And I'll follow you in
whatever you choose to do.

82
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,250
Thanks a lot.

83
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:25,041
Hey kid, you up
for a little walk?

84
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,166
I never thought we'd be able to

85
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,958
hide out so close
to Rome like this.

86
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,291
We haven't seen a single
cop the whole time.

87
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,208
The authorities in these parts

88
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,375
only have eyes for the
Five Republics Faction.

89
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,958
We should be able to lay
low here for quite a while.

90
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:57,583
Are you tired of
living out here?

91
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,083
Not at all.

92
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,625
I'm surprised how fond
I've grown of the country

93
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,500
in such a short time.

94
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:08,541
It's better than I
expected it to be.

95
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:12,083
Course, Domenico and
Paola are so nice to me...

96
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,791
But... it dulls my skills.

97
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,333
"Touching your emotions
will make you weak"...

98
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,375
That's what my
teacher said to me.

99
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,625
Teacher?

100
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:29,250
He was a bodyguard who
worked with my uncle.

101
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,458
He had this
beautiful black dog...

102
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,541
It always slept on the
top of his car with him.

103
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,708
They called him "John the
Nameless" or "John Doe."

104
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:43,291
He claimed to be former CIA, but
nobody knew his true identity.

105
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,500
If you really wanna
be a killer...

106
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,500
You're gonna have to ditch
those useless emotions of yours.

107
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,416
Those who never
stop thinking are weak.

108
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,000
You have to consider other
people's lives as garbage.

109
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,208
So, what happened to him?

110
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:23,958
It came to him out of
the clear blue one day.

111
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,708
The most skilled
assassin I've known

112
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:29,500
was taken down by nothing
more than a stray bullet.

113
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,750
You and Flanca are
such nice people...

114
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,833
I think it'd be a waste
if you wound up dead.

115
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,375
Then again...

116
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:43,250
It's not good to have a
defeatist attitude like that...

117
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:48,333
Sometimes... I think
that's why John died.

118
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,666
I don't know.

119
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,458
I'm surprised... never
seen you confused before.

120
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,333
So, are you and Flanca together?

121
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,916
We're not.

122
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,958
She drives away the
emptiness inside me

123
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,416
and encourages me to live.

124
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,750
She is my reason for living.

125
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,500
Just like Cristiano is to you.

126
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,375
Oh... I see.

127
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,833
I've been missing
my uncle a lot.

128
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,208
It's the same song again.

129
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,833
Apparently, it's a piece
Cristiano used to play a lot

130
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,625
for Pinocchio when
he was just a kid.

131
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,250
Did he learn to play
the piano from him?

132
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,333
No. He learned it by ear.

133
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:46,375
Which is why it's the
only thing he ever plays.

134
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,166
That's really sad...

135
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,083
He's Pinocchio's
surrogate father...

136
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,750
But he hasn't done
a damn thing for him.

137
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,000
Excuse me.

138
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,041
Oh hi, Paola. What is it?

139
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,916
You have a call from Marinov.

140
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,125
Hello? Uncle Marinov?

141
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,750
Hello, Caterina.

142
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,291
I was starting to get worried.

143
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:18,000
You've been out of contact
for two months now.

144
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,291
The police came after me

145
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,208
following my meeting
with you in Rome.

146
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,166
I had no choice but
to go into hiding.

147
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,375
Makes sense.

148
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,875
I heard you ran into
some trouble, as well...

149
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,666
I'm glad to know
you're all right...

150
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,375
There's more for us to discuss,

151
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,458
but we have some urgent
business right now.

152
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,125
It's about the in-fighting
among the Milan faction

153
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,666
I mentioned before...

154
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,625
It sounds as if Cristiano is
finally being shown the door.

155
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,625
The damage done is enormous!

156
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,791
I've lost count of the number of
M.P.s we've found slaughtered...

157
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,291
And our weapons
supply has been cut.

158
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,000
And don't you
conveniently forget

159
00:12:57,083 --> 00:13:01,333
the disaster that
kidnapping plot turned into!

160
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,541
How could I...?!

161
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,625
This year's failures
will set a bad example

162
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,791
unless someone takes
some responsibility!

163
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,875
The Milan faction has
been doing nothing

164
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,125
but losing battles with
government agencies lately...

165
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,666
It's epidemic...

166
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,583
In all likelihood, he'll be
sold out to the authorities

167
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:28,000
soon enough, as a way of,
say, forced resignation.

168
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:33,000
Apparently, that's the endgame
the leaders decided on.

169
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,625
My point is that if you
want to continue your work

170
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,333
with the Five Republics
Faction, the wise money

171
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,583
would be on you severing
all your ties with Cristiano.

172
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,375
Do you understand?

173
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,208
Yes... I understand.

174
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,500
Where's Pinocchio?

175
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,708
He's already in bed.

176
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,583
Well what happened to him?

177
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:11,166
Got drunk... Had a few
glasses and keeled over...

178
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,208
Apparently it was the first time
the kid had ever had alcohol.

179
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,791
Is something the matter?

180
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:39,625
I see. So Cristiano
is being held responsible.

181
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,458
What now?

182
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,875
My uncle said the
best thing for us

183
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,875
would be to stay
put for a while.

184
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,541
Fine, we'll stay put then...

185
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,458
But how do we explain
all of this to Pinocchio?

186
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,375
I don't know.

187
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,291
Maybe there's a way he
can avoid being ousted.

188
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,708
But how?

189
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,250
With Cristiano out of the
picture, the Milan faction

190
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,916
may be forced to compromise
with the government.

191
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,916
Which would be
really bad for us.

192
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:20,208
So... we'll just have
to blow this thing up.

193
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,833
What is that?

194
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,708
It's a survey bridge they built
as a test before they began

195
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:30,541
the major construction
of the Messina Bridge.

196
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,208
It wouldn't take a whole lot...

197
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,625
I bet we could carry enough
explosives to bring it down...

198
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:39,000
If we succeed, they'd halt the
construction of the major bridge

199
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,958
and Cristiano could avoid
being held responsible.

200
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,458
I think you're right...

201
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,708
I'm game. Let's
draw up the plans.

202
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,458
We have to move
quickly on this.

203
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:50,291
Tomorrow afternoon,
we're out of here.

204
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,083
Franco?

205
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,916
Thanks.

206
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:06,875
So this leader came to
Florence six months ago?

207
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,708
Back during the Pirazzi
tax evasion incident.

208
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,500
The Milan Group made contact...

209
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,375
They called the Ministry
of Interior this morning...

210
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,125
Said they'd reveal his
location with conditions.

211
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,625
That's not a bad offer...
Do we have a name yet?

212
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,375
Yes, it's Cristiano...
Savonarola...

213
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,625
He's an upstart leader
from the middle-class...

214
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:29,416
Which, as you know, is quite
the rarity for the F.R.F.

215
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,750
As a result of this...

216
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,375
there's a lot of backlash
within the Milan group.

217
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:37,666
Savonarola, really?
Coincidence or not, it's ironic.

218
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,916
He may have given
himself that name.

219
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,458
We don't know.

220
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,375
What we do know is that
he's quite fond of art.

221
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,791
And that apparently he's
plotting a terrorist attack

222
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,458
on the Messina Bridge.

223
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,958
May we dispatch the fratellos?

224
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,541
Permission granted.

225
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:58,375
But I want Cristiano captured
in Milan at the same time.

226
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,541
Savonarola?

227
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,125
A Florentine priest...

228
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,416
500 years ago,
he held real power

229
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,875
over the people who
heard him speak.

230
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,708
While the word of God was the
basis for his harsh teachings...

231
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:19,166
He was still brought to trial...
and they executed him.

232
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,833
Oh...

233
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,125
What a weird looking hood.

234
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,333
This is Claes.

235
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,250
Claes. Is Triela there with you?

236
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,208
Yes, she's right here.

237
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,916
This is Triela speaking.

238
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,916
Triela. We have urgent work.

239
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,125
Yes, sir... So we're
going to Milan...

240
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:51,208
Yes... I'll tell her
right now, sir.

241
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:57,833
I'm going to Milan tomorrow.
And Rico, you're coming with.

242
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,083
Nice.

243
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:02,291
Henrietta and Beatrice
are going to Messina.

244
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,500
You think you can hold
down the fort, Claes?

245
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,875
Of course, I can.

246
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,000
Really? Milan?

247
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,583
Yeah...

248
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,833
We've been assigned to take down
a very high level F.R.F. member.

249
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,250
So how have you
been feeling lately?

250
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:22,625
I'm fine... I'm better
than ever... No problems.

251
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:26,208
You want to destroy the
test bridge? I'm intrigued.

252
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:29,375
If things go according to plan,
it'll be finished tonight.

253
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,750
I hear you. I think it
could lead to great things.

254
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,750
Do you want to talk
with Pinocchio?

255
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,375
Yes.

256
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,375
Hi, uncle.

257
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:46,125
Pinocchio. Are they
treating you well out there?

258
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,541
Now listen to me...

259
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,833
Flanca and Franco
are in your hands...

260
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,166
Do not let them get killed.

261
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,000
Not a chance.
You can count on me.

262
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,625
One other thing...

263
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,291
Yeah?

264
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:02,250
Ah, nothing. Forget it...
Just watch your back.

265
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,833
I will.

266
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,833
My uncle didn't sound
right on the phone...

267
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,041
You think something
happened to him?

268
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,166
No...

269
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,791
He was probably just
a little confused

270
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,458
because of the change
in our plans.

271
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,041
We need to stay focused
on doing the job...

272
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,208
Let it go.

273
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,583
Right.

274
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,041
Well, approaching from the
land side isn't an option.

275
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,041
Security is too
tight to sneak past.

276
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,333
Then the only choice we have

277
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,125
is to use a boat
to get close enough.

278
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:15,125
The survey bridge might have
its sea side unguarded.

279
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:19,125
I didn't see any security
ships on the satellite images.

280
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,583
Let's just hope
that's still the case.

281
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:28,250
Bernardo come in...
Do you see anything?

282
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,166
Everything looks pretty
normal from up here.

283
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,750
I've got nothing... Bea?

284
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,083
No... don't see anything.

285
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,375
What do you smell?

286
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,250
Nothing.

287
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,583
So, Jose...

288
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:42,958
You think the Padania's
really showing up tonight?

289
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,833
I mean there's no way
they could even get close

290
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,666
with all the security.

291
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,916
Why don't you return to the
construction site gate...

292
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,916
I think we're gonna walk
over to the survey bridge,

293
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,791
check it out...
Henrietta, stick close to me.

294
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,333
Yes, sir!

295
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,291
You didn't hurt
yourself, did you?

296
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,875
I'm fine.

297
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:03,083
I hear the runt's first
job went rather well.

298
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,958
Why did you feel it correct
to teach him how to kill?

299
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,583
Hey... listen it was
his idea, not mine...

300
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:13,083
He just wanted to be as
helpful to you as he could.

301
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,916
The kid's got a natural
ability to do this job...

302
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,166
Who knows? With a little work,

303
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,166
someday he could be
even better than me.

304
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,750
What brought this about
in the first place, though?

305
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,666
I've finally grown old enough...

306
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,750
I understand the joy that can be
found in teaching the youth...

307
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:29,083
It's kinda like... well...

308
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,166
like I'm leaving behind
a double of myself

309
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,291
so he can continue
the good work.

310
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:41,583
What? Is that wrong?
Everybody wants a legacy.

311
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,250
Well, it doesn't
matter anyway...

312
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:48,250
After all, he's just an
orphan I took in on a whim.

313
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,500
A whim?

314
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:50,958
No, I don't think so...

315
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:54,125
As long as I've known you,
you've always wanted a son.

316
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,625
Hell, that's why you
named him what you did.

317
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,958
I'm just a well-to-do thug.

318
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:02,458
No amount of money and power

319
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:04,500
can teach anyone
how to raise a child.

320
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,000
I certainly don't know how.

321
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,333
There are lots of different ways

322
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,916
that a father can
show affection.

323
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:16,666
Giving him orders and
teaching him to kill...

324
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,916
That's just one way
of going about it...

325
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,166
There are plenty of others.

326
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,125
What ever happened to,

327
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:27,000
"touching your emotions
will make you weak"?

328
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,541
Probably just goes to show
you how old I've gotten...

329
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:41,083
I may be dull in my old age...
But at least I'm having fun.
