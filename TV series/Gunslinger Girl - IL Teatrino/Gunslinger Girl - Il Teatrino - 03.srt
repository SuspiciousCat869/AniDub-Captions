1
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:48,500
Do Hilshire's presents not
make you happy anymore?

2
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,666
He doesn't even
care what I like.

3
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,125
He just gets me the
same thing every year.

4
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,291
Triela.

5
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:14,708
No more shooting
without my permission.

6
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:19,541
If that's the case...

7
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,333
Then what's stopping
you from increasing

8
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,708
the level of my conditioning?

9
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,083
Hold down the fort, alright?

10
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,791
Will do.

11
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,416
Alright...

12
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,333
So what kind of things should
I work on today then?

13
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:44,083
A Public Safety investigator
has disappeared in the north.

14
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,583
That's why I'm asking all
of the members of Section 2

15
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,791
to head up there and
take a good look around.

16
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,291
So you up for it?

17
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,000
Looks like I don't
really have a choice,

18
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,333
given that the chief of Section
2 already gave his approval.

19
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,625
The Public Safety
official we're looking for

20
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:01,000
was last heard from in a
small town called Montalchino.

21
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:04,000
He'd been investigating an
assassin named Pinocchio

22
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,458
who works for the Padania,

23
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:09,583
better known to us as
the Five Republics Faction.

24
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:13,750
My advice to you is to
simply watch your ass.

25
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,583
You know I can go if
you don't feel up to it.

26
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,541
It might be too much
for a Section 2 pansy.

27
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:23,208
Thank you for the offer...
but it won't be necessary.

28
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,666
My Triela does exceptional work.
We'll be just fine.

29
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,291
If you feel that way and refuse
to increase her conditioning,

30
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,541
then it's your responsibility
to train her correctly.

31
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,708
Though to be perfectly honest,
I'm not one to talk.

32
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,583
I'm not gonna give
her conditioning

33
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:53,708
when she doesn't need it...
That's what's bothering me.

34
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,416
We're both stuck doing
jobs we're not good at.

35
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:07,166
Good morning, Hilshire!
How are you today?

36
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:16,708
Good morning, Triela...
You look ready.

37
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,958
So this is Montalcino.

38
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:03,500
It looks like every town
in the middle of Tuscany.

39
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,791
I feel really out of place here.

40
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,125
Uncomfortable.

41
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,875
We usually don't come to
the countryside, do we?

42
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,916
Are you sure about
these clothes...?

43
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,333
I feel like I'm
going to stand out.

44
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:23,833
No, they'll be useful to us...
For example...

45
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,541
What if I want to take you
out to a nice restaurant?

46
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,750
And besides...

47
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,375
Besides?

48
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,791
They look very nice on you.

49
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,750
So about this Public
Safety Official...

50
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,958
since his car is still
in the parking lot,

51
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,833
does that mean we
look for him in town?

52
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:04,583
And who is this Pinocchio
person he was looking for?

53
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,458
These are all good questions...

54
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:11,291
But let's start out by finding
the hotel Cohan was staying at.

55
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,041
I got one more...

56
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:17,916
Why are we the ones they sent
out here to track down this guy?

57
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,541
Beats me...
Section 2 isn't the most

58
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,291
respected division
at the agency.

59
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,625
So I guess this could be
some kind of conspiracy.

60
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,791
Oh well... Nothing
to worry about.

61
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,041
Understood...

62
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,708
We're always surrounded
by enemies, aren't we?

63
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,125
It doesn't bother me.

64
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:38,166
I have an ally I can
trust above all others.

65
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,625
Please don't say that
you're talking about me.

66
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,333
What if I am?

67
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:47,125
I promise I will never
betray you, Triela.

68
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,375
You can count on that.

69
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,750
Nicholas Cambio.

70
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,458
Here it is.

71
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,500
Cambio? I thought
the subject's name was Cohan?

72
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:26,666
Cambio is an alias
he's known to use.

73
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,708
Thank you...

74
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:33,666
I'd like to take a look inside
this room if you don't mind.

75
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,625
Why certainly, sir.

76
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,125
I'm impressed.

77
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,125
You're really good
at that stuff.

78
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,333
Well, thank you...

79
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,083
I was a police
detective at one point.

80
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:53,333
Comes naturally. This is my
real identity-only altered.

81
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:57,291
I'm still 99% cop, I just
work someplace else now.

82
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,625
By that logic, if you're 99%
cop, I must be a total fake.

83
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,250
Triela.

84
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,833
Open the suitcase.

85
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,166
Right.

86
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,083
Bust the locks if you have to.

87
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:45,166
I don't have to.
I've been practicing.

88
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,875
Must be an address
or a phone number.

89
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,875
I'm going downstairs
to check this out...

90
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,791
Yes, sir.

91
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,333
"The Adventures of Pinocchio."

92
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:31,208
Pinocchio was a puppet boy
made from magical firewood.

93
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,625
Every night, he would
sit by the window

94
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,000
and wish on the same
star for the same gift--

95
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,375
to repay Mister Geppetto
for creating him.

96
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,500
He tried to repay
him on his own,

97
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,458
but because his head
was made of wood,

98
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,833
it only got him into trouble.

99
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,750
One day, something
terrible happened

100
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,916
and Pinocchio was taken
away from Mister Geppetto.

101
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,375
He fought the whole
time to get back home

102
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,458
and faced many
adventures along the way.

103
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,166
Upon returning to
Geppetto's loving arms,

104
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,125
a blue fairy
granted him one wish

105
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:13,625
and Pinocchio was transformed
into a real, live boy.

106
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,458
What a stupid story.

107
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,208
Hello there!

108
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,875
I'm sorry. Do you live here?

109
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:21,125
Huh? No... But I
live kinda close by.

110
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,458
Are you... Are you
looking for Pino?

111
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:26,958
Actually, no.

112
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,875
I came to see
someone named Massimo.

113
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,125
Is this his house?

114
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,791
Massimo hasn't been here
for a really long time.

115
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,333
He lives in Milan now.

116
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,541
That's why he's renting
this place to Pino.

117
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,500
I think they're related.

118
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,375
Is that so...

119
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:42,916
What's that?

120
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,291
My mom made it.

121
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,000
I came by to bring some to Pino.

122
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:51,000
I see... It looks delicious.

123
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:54,000
Well, thank you...
You've been a big help.

124
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:59,291
I guess pretty girls can be
cool and easygoing, too...

125
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,875
It seems like someone else
is living in that house...

126
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,916
Like a relative or something.

127
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,500
She said his name was Pino.

128
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,458
I heard something
about a man renting

129
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,708
the second home of
a rich man here...

130
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,458
This definitely seems
to be the place

131
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,500
of the official
we're looking for.

132
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,875
I hope the microphone I planted
helps us learn something.

133
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,625
This is becoming too much
work for just the two of us.

134
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,291
It'll take about
an hour for help

135
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,708
from the Florence
branch to arrive.

136
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,291
Pino?

137
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,375
Freeze!

138
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,750
Drop the gun, now! Drop it!

139
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,875
A kid...? Are you one of
those government assassins?

140
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,958
A what...? But I...

141
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:49,000
Put the gun down...!
Leave it on the table!

142
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,875
--No! Please! Let me go!
--Who is this girl?

143
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,750
--I don't know what's going on!
--I don't know.

144
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,541
I figured she was
one of those assassins

145
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,000
you were talking about earlier.

146
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,708
Aurora...

147
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,791
Pino!

148
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,333
Do you know her?

149
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,916
Pino...! Help me...! Please!

150
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,958
What are you doing here?

151
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,583
I told you to stay away from me.

152
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:25,958
Why...?! Pino...!
I don't understand!

153
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,166
I told you not
to hang around me.

154
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,458
This is bad...

155
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:33,166
It sounds like
they've caught the girl.

156
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,708
Do you think the F.R.F.
might be holed up in that house?

157
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:40,208
Triela... Bust in
and save her...

158
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,458
Are you sure you want
me to do that now...?

159
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,833
Our back up hasn't
even arrived yet.

160
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,000
Plus, we don't know what

161
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,958
the Public Safety
Official's status is--

162
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,500
or how many we're up against.

163
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:53,125
I promise I won't say anything!

164
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:56,875
Let me go home! Please!

165
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,250
I can't just ignore her.

166
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,333
Triela! Get in there
and save that girl!

167
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:07,750
Right. I'm on my way!

168
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,333
Pinocchio! Explain to
us what's going on!

169
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,458
She's just a kid
from the neighborhood.

170
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,708
She follows me around.
Won't leave me alone.

171
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,333
What are you gonna do about it?

172
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,333
What do you mean...?
I have to kill her now...

173
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,833
She's seen your faces.

174
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,458
Hold on...!

175
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,541
It's not that big
of a deal, alright?

176
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,375
It is if it interferes
with my old man's work.

177
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,500
You know...

178
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,166
I'm the one who
chooses who we kill.

179
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,916
Have it your way...

180
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,958
You guys are really
nice, aren't you?

181
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:56,375
All right, let's get out of here
and report to Cristiano later...

182
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,208
Does that sound like
a good plan to you?

183
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,625
Freeze, Padania!

184
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,750
Drop your weapons and
get down on the floor!

185
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,708
It looks like this one
is the real assassin.

186
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,083
What was your first clue?

187
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,458
Get down...! All of you!

188
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,041
Franco...! Go on ahead!

189
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,375
Hold it right there!

190
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,166
I'm sorry about this.
I'll let you go soon, I promise.

191
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,750
Freeze...! Police!

192
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,125
Is there something wrong?

193
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,541
Now hand me your weapon.

194
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,583
Flanca.

195
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:02,750
Are you all right?

196
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,041
I'm fine.

197
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,875
Triela...! Triela!

198
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:58,000
Are you all right? Talk to me.

199
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,708
Hilshire...!

200
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,291
Take it easy...

201
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,875
You probably have a concussion.

202
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,041
Where's the girl?

203
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,833
She's safe.

204
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,375
We let the police
take care of her.

205
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,291
The Public Safety
Official's body

206
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,416
was found in the wine cellar.

207
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,666
I guess it was Pinocchio who
was staying there after all.

208
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,083
And the others?

209
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm sorry... But
they all got away.

210
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:30,166
I can't believe I
let them escape...

211
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,541
without even a scratch.

212
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,833
You also saved a
little girl's life...

213
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,083
and we both made it out alive.

214
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,291
There's nothing to regret.

215
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,458
We had no idea who
we were dealing with...

216
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,958
Besides, I'm the one
who told you to storm--

217
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:58,125
I'm cybernetic! And I was
beaten with human hands!

218
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:03,375
Everything... all the risks...

219
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:07,083
Every sacrifice I've made
has been for nothing.

220
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,291
It was all meaningless.

221
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,583
Triela...

222
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:21,458
Please don't touch me!

223
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:25,833
I just want to be
alone for awhile.

224
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,625
How about the
vineyards in Frascati?

225
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,125
Considering what just happened,

226
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,666
I think we should head
south-closer to Rome.

227
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,541
Sounds good. I'll find
us a rental car...

228
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:59,291
And I'll call
Cristiano on the way.

229
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:02,541
Is your hand still
swollen? Let me see.

230
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:05,791
So...

231
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,375
That girl who came
in with the shotgun--

232
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,416
was she a government assassin?

233
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,250
I don't know. But I
was about to finish her off.

234
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,000
I just couldn't do it.

235
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:17,166
I'm really sorry that
you lost your pendant.

236
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,375
But no matter how many
memories it holds...

237
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:22,375
It isn't the object
itself that matters.

238
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:32,666
It's what's in your heart...
And you'll never lose that.
