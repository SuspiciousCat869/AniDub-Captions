1
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,333
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,375
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:31,541
- Junko: I KNOW, NEXT TIME
I'LL ASK HAMAGUCHI TO COME
WITH ME.

4
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,625
- WHO ARE YOU?

5
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,458
- I AM A FLAME HAZE.
- A WHAT?

6
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:55,250
- I AM THE FLAM HAZE
OF THE NIETONO NO SHANA.

7
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,375
- ( gasps )

8
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,208
- Junko:
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

9
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:08,750
WHY AM I SO SCARED
OF A LITTLE GIRL? 

10
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,625
NO.  STAY BACK.

11
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,291
I-- PLEASE DON'T.

12
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,875
- YOU ARE NOT
A CREDIBLE EXISTENCE.

13
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,708
YOUR SOUL HAS BEEN
CONSUMED BY A DENIZEN

14
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,208
WHICH MEANS YOU
ARE NOW DEAD.

15
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,666
- ( gasps )
- YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A TORCH.

16
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,416
JUST A SHELL OF
THE HUMAN BEING YOU ONCE WERE.

17
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,666
- Junko:
I'M DEAD? NO.

18
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,083
IF THAT WERE TRUE,
I WOULDN'T BE STANDING HERE.

19
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,458
NO.

20
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,041
SOMEONE, PLEASE?

21
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,625
SAVE ME.  MOM, I--

22
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,833
- ( gate opens )

23
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,000
- JUNKO?

24
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,750
( gasps )

25
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,875
- ( door unlocks )

26
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,750
- YES, IT'S ME.

27
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,291
- WELCOME HOME.

28
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,875
( sighs )

29
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,083
- THAT HUMAN'S REACTION...

30
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,500
IT WAS RATHER BIZARRE.

31
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,333
- Alastor: YES.
THOUGH I DOUBT IT HAS

32
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,208
ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

33
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,250
HUMANS ARE INCAPABLE
OF DETECTING

34
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,083
THE POSSESSION OF TORCHES.

35
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,750
- THAT'S TRUE.

36
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,166
THANKFULLY,
I WAS PREPARED THIS TIME.

37
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,416
THE TORCH HAD
A FAIR AMOUNT

38
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,166
OF POWER OF EXISTENCE
LEFT OVER.

39
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,750
AS A RESULT,
I WAS ABLE TO LEARN 
MORE ABOUT ITS LIFE.

40
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,916
- Alastor:
YOU MUST USE THAT INFORMATION

41
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,625
TO MIMIC THE TORCH.

42
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,375
OTHERWISE THE HUMANS
WILL BEGIN TO SUSPECT YOU.

43
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,625
I KNOW YOU WOULD
PREFER NOT TO.

44
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,791
- I SIMPLY DON'T FEEL
THAT IT'S NECESSARY. 

45
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:39,375
I AM ONLY STAYING
UNTIL THE DENIZEN
IS DESTROYED.

46
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,541
SHOULDN'T BE LONG.

47
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,125
THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE

48
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,958
IS TO FURTHER
MY INVESTIGATION.

49
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,208
NOTHING MORE.

50
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,250
THE FAMILY'S COMMON ROOM.

51
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,166
MIGHT BE CLUES HERE.

52
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,708
WEDNESDAY'S NEWSPAPER.

53
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:36,416
IF I SKIM THE LAST FEW DAYS,
I MIGHT FIND SOMETHING.

54
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,125
WHERE'S TODAY'S?

55
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,833
- I'M ABOUT TO START DINNER,
HONEY.

56
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,500
ANY REQUESTS?

57
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,083
- WHERE IS TODAY'S?
- HUH?

58
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,833
- THE NEWSPAPER.
WHERE IS IT?

59
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,416
- UH...

60
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,125
IT'S ON TOP OF
THE CABINET.

61
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,041
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO WITH IT?

62
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,875
- READ.

63
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,458
- UH...

64
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,458
JUNKO, YOU FORGOT YOUR CAKE.

65
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,416
- Shana:
I DON'T WANT IT.

66
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:05,958
- ( sighs )

67
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,875
- AH HA.

68
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,291
- Alastor: HMM.

69
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,208
"AN AMERICAN CITIZEN

70
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,875
WHO WENT MISSING
IN NEW YORK 10 YEARS AGO

71
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,500
WAS RECENTLY FOUND
IN JOUSHI PARK

72
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,458
IN YOSEGI CITY."

73
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,125
- THIS MAN,

74
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,500
DO YOU THINK HE'S
THE TORCH WE SAW YESTERDAY?

75
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,000
- Alastor:
YES.

76
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,916
IT IS TROUBLESOME
THAT SUCH A WORN OUT TORCH

77
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,916
IS ATTRACTING SO MUCH
ATTENTION FROM THE HUMANS.

78
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,083
- Newswoman: THE AMERICAN
WHO WAS FOUND IN JOUSHI PARK

79
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:54,083
IS CURRENTLY MAKING HIS WAY
INTO THE YOSEGI POLICE STATION.

80
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,083
A MALE MODEL WHO WENT
MISSING 10 YEARS AGO.

81
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,500
THE MAN WAS FOUND IN
THE SAME CLOTHES HE WAS WEARING

82
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,666
WHEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE
WAS REPORTED.

83
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,083
THE MAN CLAIMS HE HAS
NO MEMORY OF THE LAST 10 YEARS,

84
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,875
AND THEREFORE HAS NO IDEA
HOW HE MADE IT TO JAPAN. 

85
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,958
- Shana: THIS IS OBVIOUSLY
THE WORK OF A DENIZEN.

86
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,125
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

87
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,208
- Alastor: HMM.
THE MAN, NOW A TORCH,

88
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,958
WAS FOUND IN THE SAME ATTIRE
HE WAS WEARING 10 YEARS AGO.

89
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:28,041
MOST TORCHES DO NOT HAVE 
ENOUGH POWER OF EXISTENCE

90
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,791
TO LAST A DECADE.

91
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,625
AND THE GUILTY DENIZEN
WOULD HAVE FLED LONG AGO

92
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,958
TO AVOID RETRIBUTION
FROM FLAME HAZE.

93
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:36,958
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

94
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,541
MOST DENIZEN FEAR US.

95
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,541
BUT THIS ONE SEEMS DEFIANT.

96
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,250
SO I GET THE FEELING...

97
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,958
IT'S STILL SOMEWHERE
IN THIS CITY.

98
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,166
- WELCOME HOME.

99
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,583
- YOU LOOK TROUBLED, DEAR.

100
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,458
JUNKO GIVING YOU
A HARD TIME?

101
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,166
- SHE SPOKE TO ME TODAY.

102
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,166
THAT'S BETTER, RIGHT?

103
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,416
THINGS WILL BE FINE AGAIN
ONCE WE TALK ABOUT IT.

104
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,708
- I HOPE SO.

105
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,833
- Alastor:
THE DENIZEN MUST BE WEAK

106
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,208
SINCE WE CANNOT
SENSE ITS PRESENCE.

107
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,500
WHY WOULD IT STAY HERE
FOR 10 YEARS

108
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:20,583
WHEN IT'S IN CONSTANT DANGER
OF BEING ATTACKED BY FLAME HAZE?

109
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,166
- AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANT,

110
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,166
IF THAT'S THE CASE,

111
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,958
WHY ARE THERE SO FEW
TORCHES HERE?

112
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,583
- Alastor: GOOD POINT.

113
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,916
WE SEARCHED ALL DAY AND 
WE ONLY CAME ACROSS ONE.

114
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,416
- JUNKO OGAMI
IS OUR ONLY CLUE.

115
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,208
WE MUST FIND OUT WHEN 
AND WHERE SHE MET THIS
DENIZEN.

116
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:55,208
- ( knocks on door )
- Junko's mom: JUNKO, DINNER.

117
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,625
- IF THERE HAD BEEN
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
IN HER BEHAVIOR,

118
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,208
HER PARENTS
WOULD HAVE NOTICED.

119
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,333
- Junko's mom:
PLEASE, COME DOWN AND JOIN US.

120
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,041
- Alastor: THIS IS YOUR 
CHANCE TO QUESTION THEM.

121
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,875
LIKE IT OR NOT,
YOU MUST MIMIC THE TORCH

122
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,041
FOR THE SAKE OF
OUR INVESTIGATION.

123
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,958
- FINE.

124
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,583
- ( chatter on TV )

125
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,208
- ( gasps )

126
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,208
THAT IS JUNKO'S FATHER.

127
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,916
- HAVE A SEAT, HON.

128
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:38,083
THAT'S USUALLY WHERE
YOUR MOM SITS.

129
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,250
DON'T YOU WANT
TO SEE THE TV?

130
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,833
- NO.

131
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,250
- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

132
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,666
- NO, SIR.

133
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,208
- IF YOU SAY SO.

134
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,916
- ( remote beeping )

135
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,250
- Shana: INTERACTING WITH
HUMANS CAN BE SO TEDIOUS.

136
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:55,833
HAVE YOU NOTICED ANY CHANGE
IN MY BEHAVIOR LATELY?

137
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,083
- UH...

138
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,375
UH...

139
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,458
- I SURE HOPE
THE TWO OF YOU ARE HUNGRY.

140
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,708
- ( chuckles )
YOU KNOW I AM.

141
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,416
BEEN LOOKING FORWARD
TO THIS ALL DAY.

142
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,375
- ( TV shuts off )

143
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,708
- LOOK, JUNKO,

144
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,708
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET
ABOUT WHAT MOM SAID TO YOU.

145
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,833
BUT CAN YOU HONESTLY
BLAME HER?

146
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:22,000
- UM?

147
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,208
UHH...

148
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,125
- IT'S JUST THAT SHE...

149
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,125
WAS... YOU KNOW--

150
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:31,125
SHE WAS SHAKEN
BY WHAT SHE SAW.

151
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,541
AND SHE KIND OF PANICKED.

152
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,125
THIS BOY,
HAMAGUCHI, WAS IT?

153
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,916
HE SHOULD KNOW BETTER.

154
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,583
YOUR MOM WAS
PRETTY UPSET ABOUT IT,

155
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,750
AND SHE REACTED THE WAY
ANY PARENT WOULD HAVE. 

156
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,750
JUNKO, HON,
ARE YOU LISTENING?

157
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,916
- NOTHING ELSE
HAS HAPPENED RECENTLY?

158
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
- OKAY.
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING?

159
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,416
- UH, WHERE'S THE NEWSPAPER?

160
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,291
- OH, I'LL GRAB YOU ONE.

161
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,333
- Junko's mom:
THANK YOU, JUNKO.

162
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,375
- HAVE YOU NOTICED
ANYTHING ELSE

163
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,375
ABOUT MY BEHAVIOR?

164
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,625
DO I SEEM TO
STARE OFF INTO SPACE?

165
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,916
ARE YOU STARTING TO HAVE
DIFFICULTY RECALLING
MEMORIES OF ME?

166
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,708
- UH--
- Both: WHAT?

167
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,541
- Alastor: HOW MANY TIMES
MUST I REMIND YOU

168
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,916
TO MIMIC THE TORCH?

169
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,375
YOU MUST ASSUME
THEIR PERSONALITY

170
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,208
AN UTILIZE THEIR CONNECTIONS.

171
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,875
YOUR QUESTIONING OF THE PARENTS
WAS SO STILTED,

172
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,958
YOU NEARLY BLEW OUR COVER.

173
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,625
- I LIKE TO GET
TO THE POINT.

174
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,208
THEY DIDN'T OFFER
ANY USEFUL INFORMATION.

175
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:06,000
- Alastor:
ACCORDING TO THE PARENTS,

176
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,500
THE TORCH SEEMED 
PERFECTLY NORMAL.

177
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,833
- THEY DIDN'T NOTICE
ANY BIZARRE BEHAVIOR

178
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,833
OR CHANGE IN HER DEMEANOR.

179
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,833
THE ONLY INCIDENT
WAS AN ARGUMENT

180
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,250
SHE HAD WITH HER MOTHER
THREE DAYS AGO.

181
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,833
THERE IS THE BOY...

182
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,833
YUKIO HAMAGUCHI.

183
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,833
HE'S A CLASSMATE
OF JUNKO'S.

184
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,625
DO YOU THINK HE COULD
BE INVOLVED?

185
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,291
- Alastor: POSSIBLY.

186
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,833
LET'S GO TO THE SCHOOL TOMORROW
AND QUESTION HIM.

187
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,000
- ( footsteps )

188
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,041
- WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

189
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,458
- Alastor:
SHE IS STILL UPSET

190
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,875
ABOUT THE FIGHT SHE HAD
WITH HER DAUGHTER.

191
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,458
- WELL...

192
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,041
SHE'LL FORGET SOON ENOUGH.

193
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,291
ONCE I LEAVE YOSEGI CITY,

194
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,291
IT WILL BE AS THOUGH
JUNKO NEVER EVEN EXISTED.

195
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,250
SHE WILL JUST BE GONE.

196
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,958
AND HER MOTHER WILL FORGET

197
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,666
THAT SHE EVER
HAD A DAUGHTER.

198
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,416
- ( words silent )

199
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,291
- ( kids chattering )

200
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:21,375
- Shana: SHE WAS A HIGH SCHOOL
SECOND YEAR,

201
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,500
CLASS THREE.

202
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,500
( sighs )

203
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,041
- HEY, WHAT'S UP, JUNKO?

204
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,125
- THERE SHE IS.
- HOW YOU FEELING, LOVER GIRL?

205
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,125
- Shana: SO ANNOYING.

206
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,208
- YOU SNUCK OFF
WITHOUT SPILLING THE BEANS

207
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,708
AND NOW WE'RE DYING TO KNOW.

208
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,791
- YEAH.  WE WANT
ALL THE DETAILS.

209
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,958
- LET US LIVE
VICARIOUSLY THROUGH YOU.

210
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,416
- UH-- WHAT?

211
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,250
- COME ON.
DON'T PLAY STUPID.

212
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,416
- YOU WENT OUT
WITH HAMAGUCHI, RIGHT?

213
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,916
- SECRETS DON'T MAKE FRIENDS,
YOU KNOW.

214
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,416
- THEY'RE ASKING ABOUT
YUKIO HAMAGUCHI.

215
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,000
I WISH THEY WOULD
POINT HIM OUT.

216
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:06,125
I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN HIM AND JUNKO.

217
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,833
- IT'S JUST THAT SHE...

218
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,416
WAS, YOU KNOW--

219
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,583
SHE WAS SHAKEN
BY WHAT SHE SAW,

220
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,083
AND SHE KIND OF PANICKED.

221
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:18,583
- Shana: WHAT COULD HAVE
AFFECTED HER MOTHER LIKE THAT?

222
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,416
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

223
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,791
WHERE IS HAMAGUCHI?

224
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,166
- OH, YOU CAN'T BE
WITHOUT HIM, CAN YOU?

225
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,500
- JEEZ, YOU ARE
ONE LUCKY LADY.

226
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,000
- I'M SO JEALOUS.

227
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,583
- Shana: THESE GIRLS ARE
GETTING ON MY NERVES.

228
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,375
- Hamaguchi: MORNING.
- WELL, WELL.

229
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,291
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

230
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,625
( gasps )

231
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,916
IS THAT HIM?

232
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,375
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?
- MORNING, DUDE. 

233
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,791
- IT IS.

234
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:53,833
HAMAGUCHI.

235
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:57,041
- OH.  MORNING, JUNKO.

236
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,166
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

237
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,625
- WOW.  CHECK IT.

238
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,125
HE TOTALLY DIGS HER.

239
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,041
- HE LOOKS LIKE
HE WANTS TO KISS HER, HUH?

240
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,458
- I'M SO JEALOUS!

241
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,791
- I HAVE SUDDENLY
FALLEN QUITE ILL.

242
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:10,625
I MUST LEAVE.  PLEASE INFORM
THE INSTRUCTOR FOR ME.

243
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,208
- All: HUH?

244
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,083
- YOU'VE GROWN CLOSE TO
JUNKO OGAMI

245
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,666
OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS,
CORRECT?

246
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,166
- HUH?
- I NEED TO ASK YOU

247
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,500
SOME QUESTIONS IN PRIVATE.

248
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,625
- UH-- CAN'T IT WAIT?

249
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,000
- UH, JUNKO!

250
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,833
- HEY! YOU'RE SKIPPING CLASS?

251
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,083
- SO JEALOUS!

252
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,833
- WHAT HAS GOTTEN INTO YOU?!

253
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,083
- HEY!

254
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,791
- HUH?

255
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,166
( panting )

256
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,083
DID WE HAVE TO DITCH SCHOOL?

257
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:43,500
- APOLOGIES, BUT YES,
IT WAS NECESSARY.

258
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,625
- HUH?
WHY ARE YOU TALKING FUNNY?

259
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,666
- Shana: I REFUSE.

260
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,958
I WILL NOT MIMIC THE TORCH
JUST TO QUESTION HIM.

261
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:02,125
DESCRIBE WHAT'S TRANSPIRED
OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS.

262
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:06,125
- UH, DID YOU GET REAMED
BY YOUR PARENTS?

263
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,708
UH...

264
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:08,875
IS YOUR MOM STILL MAD?

265
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,291
- UH--

266
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,958
( sighs )

267
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,291
Shana: I NEED HIM
TO ANSWER QUESTIONS,

268
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,875
NOT ASK THEM.

269
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,375
- WHO KNEW WE'D GET CAUGHT.

270
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,291
I'M REALLY SORRY.

271
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,541
I GUESS IT COULD
HAVE BEEN WORSE, HUH?

272
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:25,125
I MEAN, AT LEAST THAT WAS
ALL WE WERE DOING, YOU KNOW?

273
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:28,125
SHE HAD TO WALK THROUGH
JOUSHI PARK.

274
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,458
BUSTED ON OUR FIRST OFFENSE.
( chuckles )

275
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,541
- Shana: HE MUST BE REFERRING
TO THE ACTIVITY

276
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,708
JUNKO'S FATHER MENTIONED.

277
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:39,416
WHATEVER IT WAS, 
THIS BOY MAKES IT
SOUND HARMLESS.

278
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,000
I WONDER WHAT
THEY WERE UP TO.

279
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,750
- I'M SORRY YOU GOT
IN A FIGHT WITH YOUR PARENTS.

280
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,333
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

281
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,416
- Shana: SO THE FIGHT
WITH HER MOTHER

282
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,750
WAS A RESULT OF THAT THING
SHE WAS DOING WITH HIM

283
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,750
THREE DAYS AGO.

284
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,166
( gasps )
JOUSHI PARK.

285
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,000
- HUH?
- OF COURSE.

286
00:19:57,083 --> 00:20:00,166
- Newswoman: THE AMERICAN,
WHO WAS FOUND IN JOUSHI PARK

287
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,500
IS CURRENTLY MAKING HIS WAY
INTO THE YOSEGI POLICE STATION.

288
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,750
- IF YOU WANT TO GO,
I'LL TAKE YOU.

289
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,250
- FINALLY, A CONNECTION.

290
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,916
IT'S NOT MUCH,
BUT I'LL TAKE IT.

291
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,583
- HEY, EARTH TO JUNKO.

292
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,541
- UH, SORRY.

293
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,083
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?
YOU WERE SPACING OUT AGAIN.

294
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,583
- AGAIN?

295
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,916
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
- OH, I'M SORRY.

296
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,375
- NO, I'M NOT ANGRY.
I'M ASKING YOU.

297
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,791
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
I SPACED OUT?

298
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,791
- YOU REMEMBER,
AT THE PARK?

299
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,291
YOU EXCUSED YOURSELF
TO GO TO THE LADIES ROOM.

300
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,791
I WAITED OUTSIDE
FOR AWHILE,

301
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,791
BUT YOU NEVER MADE IT BACK.

302
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,375
I WAS WORRIED
YOU GOT LOST,

303
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,375
SO I WENT LOOKING FOR YOU.

304
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,083
THAT'S WHEN I FOUND YOU
SPACING OUT IN FRONT OF
THE LAKE.

305
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,208
AT FIRST I WALKED
RIGHT PAST YOU.

306
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,416
I DIDN'T EVEN
REALIZE YOU WERE THERE.

307
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,208
- Shana: HE WALKED PAST HER
WITHOUT REALIZING SHE WAS THERE.

308
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,791
THAT'S IT.

309
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,208
THAT'S THE MOMENT
SHE BECAME A TORCH.

310
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,708
THREE DAYS AGO,
JUNKO OGAMI BECAME A TORCH

311
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,791
WHEN A DENIZEN
CONSUMED HER SOUL

312
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,083
AT JOUSHI PARK.

313
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,250
( gasps )

314
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,166
- JUNKO, ARE YOU
FEELING ALL RIGHT?

315
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,833
- WALK ME THROUGH WHAT HAPPENED
AT JOUSHI PARK THAT DAY.

316
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:11,333
WHY WERE WE THERE? 
WHAT WERE WE DOING?
EVERYTHING.

317
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,083
- UH...

318
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,458
- Alastor:
THE DENIZEN MUST HAVE
MADE CONTACT WITH

319
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:58,333
YUKIO HAMAGUCHI
AND JUNKO OGAMI
IN JOUSHI PARK.

320
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:59,708
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

321
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,125
HOWEVER, THERE IS ONE THING

322
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,708
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND.

323
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:05,708
HOW COME IT ONLY
ATTACKED HER?

324
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,083
WHY NOT KILL BOTH?

325
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,708
- Alastor: HOPEFULLY,

326
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,708
WE WILL COME ONE STEP CLOSER
TO SOLVING THAT MYSTERY

327
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,500
WHEN WE VISIT JOUSHI PARK
TOMORROW.

328
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,208
- Junko's mom:
WELCOME HOME. 

329
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,916
I BOUGHT CAKE.
- EXCUSE ME?

330
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,666
- YOUR OTHER ONE
GOT CRUSHED,

331
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,833
SO I BOUGHT YOU ANOTHER.

332
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,291
- MMM!

333
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,333
- NO MATTER HOW OLD YOU GET,

334
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,875
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
MY LITTLE GIRL, JUNKO.

335
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,916
EVERY TIME YOU EAT,
EVER SINCE YOU WERE A BABY,

336
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,791
YOU END UP WITH FOOD
ON YOUR FACE.

337
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:04,833
- I HAVEN'T CHANGED?

338
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,625
- NOT MUCH.

339
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,958
I REMEMBER YOU USED TO
CRAWL INTO MY BED AT NIGHT

340
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:10,458
WHENEVER YOU WERE SCARED.

341
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:11,875
NOW THAT YOU'RE OLDER,

342
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,791
YOU STAY IN YOUR OWN BED.

343
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:16,333
BUT YOU'RE STILL
SCARED OF YOUR SHADOW.

344
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:19,375
WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE THOUGH,
IT DIDN'T MATTER.

345
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,791
WHETHER IT WAS HEAVY RAIN
OR THUNDER,

346
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,958
OR SOMETHING
ON TV SCARED YOU,

347
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,375
YOU'D RUN STRAIGHT
FOR MY BEDROOM.

348
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,875
- Shana: IT IS DIFFICULT
TO LISTEN TO HER MOTHER 

349
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,791
REMINISCE LIKE THIS.

350
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,291
THE POOR WOMAN HAS NO IDEA

351
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,916
THAT HER DAUGHTER
IS DEAD.

352
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,208
- AND AFTER YOUR
BROTHER LEFT HOME,

353
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,375
YOU DID THE SAME THING
WHEN YOU FELT LONELY. 

354
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,791
- REALLY?

355
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,958
SO I WOULD HIDE
IN YOUR BEDROOM

356
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,791
LIKE WHEN I GOT SCARED?

357
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,166
- HMM.

358
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,833
WELL, NOT EXACTLY.

359
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:53,916
IT'S NOT THAT
YOU WERE HIDING.

360
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,500
- WHAT WAS I DOING?

361
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:58,708
- YOU WERE LONELY.

362
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:01,416
YOU WANTED TO BE
CLOSE TO SOMEONE

363
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,416
BECAUSE NO ONE EVER...

364
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,333
WANTS TO FEEL THAT WAY.

365
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:10,833
- Shana: THIS WOMAN
WILL BE FREED

366
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,000
FROM HER LONELINESS SOON.

367
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:16,833
EVENTUALLY, HER MEMORIES
OF JUNKO WILL BEGIN TO FADE

368
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,833
UNTIL THERE ARE NONE LEFT.

369
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,416
THAT IS THE FATE
OF A TORCH.

370
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,041
- Junko's mom: HERE.

371
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:25,541
I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

372
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:43,458
UNFORTUNATELY, 
I COULDN'T FIND
ONE OF THE BEADS.

373
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:46,041
SO I'M AFRAID
IT ISN'T PERFECT.

374
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:48,291
IN ITS PLACE, 
I USED THE GEM

375
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:50,875
FROM THAT RING YOU GAVE ME
YEARS AGO.

376
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:52,458
I KNOW IT'S ONLY PLASTIC,

377
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:55,458
BUT IT'S ALWAYS
BEEN PRECIOUS TO ME.

378
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:56,458
- ( gasps )

379
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,583
- ( Junko gasps )

380
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,500
( sighs )

381
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:16,875
( crying )

382
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:34,291
- I'M SO SORRY.

383
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:45,875
- ( chuckles )

384
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:03,958
Shana:
JUNKO WAS NOT UPSET.

385
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:05,500
SHE WAS CAREFREE.

386
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:12,916
I FORGIVE YOU, MOTHER.

387
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,958
- ( sighs )

388
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:16,333
THANK YOU, JUNKO.

389
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:22,541
- FOR THE FIRST TIME
SINCE COMING TO THIS WORLD,

390
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,958
I HAVE CAUSED
A SMILE TOO. 

391
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:28,291
NOT ONLY AS THE TORCH
WHO'S PLACE I'VE TAKEN,

392
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:30,250
BUT AS A FLAME HAZE.

393
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:35,166
- Junko: I KNOW.

394
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:38,958
NEXT TIME, I'LL ASK HAMAGUCHI
TO COME WITH ME.

395
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:45,375
- ( theme music playing )

396
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,791
- ( singing in Japanese )
