1
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,333
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,375
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:06,916
- ( music box playing )

4
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,500
- ( clatters )

5
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,750
- ( sighs )
HOT.

6
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,166
SHANA!

7
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,750
- WHAT?

8
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,000
- THERE ANY UNRESTRICTED SPELLS

9
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,250
THAT CAN COOL US OFF?

10
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,625
- I'M NOT YOUR
PERSONAL A.C. 

11
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,166
- SO THAT'S A "NO" THEN?

12
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,708
MAN!

13
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,208
WHAT'S THE POINT OF 
EVEN CASTING SPELLS?

14
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,083
- ( grunts )
SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP!

15
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,750
SPELLS LIKE THAT ONE
ARE WAY TOO DELICATE

16
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,166
AND CAN'T BE USED
CASUALLY!

17
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,083
- ( gasps )

18
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,166
- HUMPH.

19
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,958
- Yuji: SO IT'S NOT
THAT YOU CAN'T,

20
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,791
YOU JUST WON'T.

21
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:46,958
( sighs )

22
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,458
- ( sighs )

23
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,000
- YEAH.
- THAT'S THE STUFF.

24
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,458
- SO MUCH STUFF HERE.

25
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,791
IT'S GONNA TAKE FOREVER
TO SIFT THROUGH ALL OF IT.

26
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,208
- Alastor: THINK OF THIS 
AS PART OF YOUR TRAINING.

27
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,291
DON'T LOOK WITH YOUR
EYES AND HANDS.

28
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,625
REACH OUT WITH YOUR
POWER OF EXISTENCE.

29
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,833
FEEL THE SPACE AROUND YOU,

30
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,000
AND SEE WHAT REACHES BACK.

31
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:27,833
- Yuji: HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO KNOW HOW MUCH POWER OF
EXISTENCE

32
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,791
TO GIVE OUT TO
WHAT ITEMS?

33
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,750
WHAT IF THERE'S
A TREASURE TOOL
THAT EXPLODES

34
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,833
WHEN YOU PUT POWER OF EXISTENCE
INTO IT?

35
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,625
- Shana: YEAH.  MIGHT BE.
- ( gasps )

36
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,000
WHOA.

37
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,208
SOME KIND OF TELESCOPE?

38
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,750
HEY, SHANA.

39
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,125
Yuji: WHAT--

40
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,708
WHAT HAPPENED?

41
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,291
( gasps )

42
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,583
I-- WHAT?!

43
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,041
- ( gasps )

44
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,458
- Yuji: WHAT THE HECK
JUST HAPPENED?

45
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,791
- ( gasps, screams )

46
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,708
NO!

47
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:29,791
( whimpers )

48
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,750
- KEEP IT TOGETHER.

49
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,125
- SHANA.

50
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,833
- Alastor: YUJI SAKAI,
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

51
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,000
- SO THIS IS MY FAULT?

52
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,083
- ANSWER HIM.
WHAT DID YOU DO TO CAUSE THIS?

53
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,833
- WHAT DID--

54
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:58,166
WELL, I FOUND AN OLD BLACK
TELESCOPE LOOKING THING,

55
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,708
BUT ALL I DID WAS
LOOK AT YOU THROUGH IT.

56
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,000
- ALASTOR?

57
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,416
- HMM.

58
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,916
AN OLD BLACK TELESCOPE,
YOU SAY.

59
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,708
IT MUST BE A RESHUFFLE.

60
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,208
- UHH.

61
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,500
- Alastor:
AS YOU'VE JUST DISCOVERED,

62
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,500
IT IS A TREASURE TOOL
WHICH TRANSPOSES

63
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,958
THE CONSCIOUSNESS
OF THE LOOKER AND
THE LOOKIE.

64
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,375
- IT IS...

65
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,166
MY FAULT.

66
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,250
- Alastor: FEAR NOT.
THIS CAN BE REVERSED.

67
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,875
ALL YOU NEED DO IS PEER THROUGH
THE SPY GLASS AGAIN.

68
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,541
- OH, GOOD. THEN THERE SHOULD
BE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

69
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,583
- NO, NO!

70
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,708
- WHOA!

71
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,375
( grunts )

72
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,041
- WATCH THE HANDS.

73
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,291
YOU-- JERK FACE.

74
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,625
- OH, SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING BY IT.

75
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,250
I JUST-- AAH!

76
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,083
( gasps )

77
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,208
HUH?

78
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,083
( grunts )

79
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,791
- HEY!  WHAT WERE YOU
LOOKING AT RIGHT THERE?

80
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,375
- NOTHING.
I SAW NOTHING.

81
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,875
- ( groans )
- ( whimpers )

82
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,708
STOP IT, SHANA, PLEASE?

83
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,958
- STOP TRYING TO DO
PERVY THINGS TO MY BODY.

84
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,708
- I'M NOT.
YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

85
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,708
- SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP!

86
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:06,583
- SO WE'LL SWITCH BACK 
IF WE LOOK THROUGH THAT
THING AGAIN, RIGHT?

87
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,291
LET'S SEARCH FOR IT OVER 
WHERE I WAS A MINUTE AGO.

88
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,458
- Alastor: OH MY!
YOU MUST MAKE HASTE.

89
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,666
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
CAN PEOPLE DISCOVER 
WHAT'S BEFALLEN YOU.

90
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,416
ESPECIALLY OTHER FLAME HAZE.

91
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,083
- WHAT--
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

92
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,416
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

93
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,500
- YEAH, ALASTOR.  WHY?

94
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,833
- Alastor:
THERE'S NO TIME TO EXPLAIN.

95
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,333
- Sato: YO!
WE GOT THE ICE CREAM.

96
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,000
- Tanaka: A WHOLE BUNCH OF IT,
LIKE SHANA SAID.

97
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:30,833
WHOA, PRETTY DARK IN HERE.
DID THEY TAKE OFF?

98
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,791
- Sato: HEY!
- WHAT DO WE DO NOW, SHANA?

99
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,000
- START BY NOT SHOWING
WEAKNESS WITH MY FACE.

100
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,416
- YEAH, BUT--

101
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,208
- SUMMON YOGASA.
- WHAT?

102
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,000
- WE'LL GRAB EVERYTHING
IN THAT VICINITY

103
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,916
AND SORT THROUGH IT
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,958
WELL, ALASTOR?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

105
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,833
- HMM.

106
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,791
- Alastor: FINE.

107
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:54,375
- LET GO OF YOUR EMOTIONS
AND ENVISION THE POWER
YOU'RE SEEKING.

108
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,375
FOCUS ON THE FORM
AND STRENGTH

109
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,625
OF THE FLAMING-HAIRED,
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER.

110
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,000
AND EMBRACE IT USING 
THE POWER WITHIN YOU.

111
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,625
- GUYS, WHERE THE HELL
ARE YOU?

112
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,375
- ICE CREAM'S MELTING--
UHH?!

113
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,208
- UH, HOW MUCH STUFF
SHOULD I PULL IN?

114
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,666
- THAT SHOULD DO.
AND HERE THEY COME.

115
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,583
- ( grunts )

116
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,625
- YEP, THEY'RE DOWN HERE.

117
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,375
WHAT'S UP?

118
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,458
- DUDE, WHY DIDN'T YOU
HOLLER BACK AT US, SAKAI?

119
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,583
- YEAH, SORRY.
GUESS WE COULDN'T HEAR YOU.

120
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:30,916
- UH, YEAH.

121
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,250
I WAS ASKING SAKAI.

122
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,916
- UM, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID...

123
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,500
A SECOND AGO, RIGHT?

124
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,791
- UM, RIGHT, YES.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS SAYING.

125
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,833
- IS THERE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH YOU TWO? 

126
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,666
- OH, NO.
OF COURSE NOT.

127
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,500
( chuckles )
I'M GOOD OLD YUJI SAK--

128
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,666
- REALLY, NOTHING WRONG HERE.

129
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,750
SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP.

130
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,500
- IF YOU'RE GONNA SAY IT,
SAY IT RIGHT.

131
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,916
- YEAH, WHATEVER.
NICE LAUGH BY THE WAY.

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,083
- OH, THAT IS EXACTLY
HOW YOU LAUGH.

133
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,958
- IS THAT REALLY
HOW YOU THINK OF ME?

134
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,458
- SO WHAT DID HAPPEN
TO YOU GUYS?

135
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,166
- ( both chuckle )
NOTHING.

136
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,041
- ( Alastor clears throat )

137
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,458
- ALASTOR,
SHED SOME LIGHT HERE?

138
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,083
- I JUST RECALLED
AN URGENT MATTER.

139
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,875
SHANA, YUJI?

140
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,041
- RIGHT, THAT.
WE'D BETTER BE OFF THEN.

141
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,875
- GOTTA RUN, BOYS.
SEE YOU.

142
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,958
- YEAH, BYE.

143
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,625
SEE YOU?

144
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,000
- ( grunts )

145
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,958
- WOW. WAY TO BE GRACEFUL.
JEEZ.

146
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:27,125
- DON'T YELL AT ME.
I'M NOT USED TO WALKING
IN THESE SHOES.

147
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,125
- SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP!
JUST TRY TO BE MORE CAREFUL.

148
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,291
- LET'S GO SEE IF
MARGERY'S HOME YET.

149
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,541
- BUT THEY...
TOOK ALL THE ICE CREAM.

150
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:46,208
- YEAH SO, WE'D BETTER
SWITCH OURSELVES BACK 
PRETTY SOON.

151
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:49,958
KNOW ANYWHERE WE CAN
GO THROUGH ALL THAT
STUFF WE COLLECTED?

152
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,333
- CAN'T WE JUST
CAST A SEAL?

153
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,666
- NO WAY.

154
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,583
WILHELMINA AND THE
CHANTER OF ELEGIES

155
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:58,458
WILL TOTALLY SENSE IT
AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S UP.

156
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,166
THE LARGEST ROOM

157
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,000
WHERE NO ONE
WILL BOTHER US.

158
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,416
- WHAT ABOUT A KARAOKE BOOTH?

159
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,166
- KARAOKE?

160
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,583
- THEY HAVE A PARTY ROOM,
PLENTY OF PRIVACY,

161
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,291
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
THEY HAVE A.C.

162
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,791
- Margery: WELL, WELL.

163
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,583
A BOY AND HIS MIDGET.

164
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,083
- CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

165
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,125
- WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO
IN SUCH A RUSH?

166
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,333
- UH... WE'RE--

167
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,916
I MEAN...

168
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,583
IT'S NONE OF YOUR CONCERN,
SO JUST BUTT OUT.

169
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:31,166
- ( chuckles )
SULLEN AND UNATTRACTIVE
AS ALWAYS.

170
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,916
- Marcosias: ( laughs )

171
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,583
OH YEAH,
THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS.

172
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,041
APPROVAL FROM SOMEONE
WHO'S DRUNK OFF HER ROCKER

173
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,291
BEFORE IT'S EVEN NOON-- OW!

174
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,875
- SHUT UP, STUPID MARCO.

175
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,625
- BY THE WAY, YOUR SIDEKICKS
ARE WAITING FOR YOU

176
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,208
AT FRIAGNE'S OLD HIDEOUT.

177
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,208
- OH, I KNOW.
DON'T YOU WORRY.

178
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,583
I'LL CATCH UP TO THEM 
AS SOON AS I DOWN THIS
LAST BEER.

179
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,625
- Marcosias: HEY, YEAH!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

180
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,791
YOU CAN'T BE DONE
TREASURE HUNTING YET.

181
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,916
- SOMETHING CAME UP.
SEE YOU.

182
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,375
- Marcosias:
WHAT IS UP WITH THEM?

183
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,208
- ( sighs )  BARKEEP,
I'M READY FOR A REFILL.

184
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,625
- WAIT.  COME ON!

185
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:13,875
- WE REALLY CANNOT AFFORD
ANY MORE DISTRACTIONS, OKAY?

186
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,291
YOU ALMOST BLEW IT BACK THERE.
- YEAH, SORRY.

187
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,791
- STOP LOOKING WEAK
WITH MY FACE.

188
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,166
YUM.
I LOVE ICE CREAM.

189
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,833
- HOW CAN YOU BE SMILING
AFTER EATING ALL THAT?

190
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,375
THERE WAS SO MUCH.

191
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,083
- FORGET THAT.
THINK OF SOMEWHERE WE CAN GO.

192
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,083
- WE NEED A LARGISH ROOM,

193
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,875
PREFERABLY OUT OF THE WAY,
SO NO ONE WILL BOTHER US. 

194
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,708
- WHAT'S GONNA BE 
EMPTY ON A SUNDAY?

195
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,083
- ( both sigh )

196
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,250
- YEAH, OF COURSE!

197
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,208
IT'S PERFECT.

198
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,958
- NOT A BAD IDEA, YUJI.

199
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,250
- SHOULDN'T BE ANYONE
HERE ON SUNDAY.

200
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,625
( yelps )

201
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,958
- SHANA, SAKAI, HEY.

202
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,916
- OH, HEY, YOU GUYS.

203
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,833
- GOOD MORNING, 
SAKAI AND SHANA.

204
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,625
- OH, GOOD.

205
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,375
I WAS WORRIED I WAS GONNA
BE THE ONLY GUY HERE.

206
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,041
- YEAH, IT'S A HOME GAME

207
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,625
AND WE WERE THE ONLY ONES
WHO BOTHERED TO SHOW UP. 

208
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,875
WE WERE JUST FIGURING OUT
WHAT TO DO.

209
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:27,625
- YEAH, UM...
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

210
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:31,291
- UH, OGATA HAS A BIG 
VOLLEYBALL GAME TODAY.

211
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,083
WE INVITED YOU TO 
COME CHEER HER ON.

212
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,583
- UHH...

213
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,708
- WE'LL JUST HAVE TO
CHEER EXTRA LOUD.

214
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:37,916
RIGHT, SAKAI?

215
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
- OH, UM... SURE.

216
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,750
- OH?
- THIS IS EXCELLENT.

217
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,125
THE TEAM WILL BE SO EXCITED

218
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,875
THAT YOU WERE ABLE
TO MAKE IT TODAY. 

219
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,291
- YEAH, COME DOWN TO
THE GYM WITH US.
- YOU SEE, I--

220
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,666
- SORRY,
WE'LL CATCH UP LATER.

221
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,958
- ( gasps )

222
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:53,916
- ( grunts )

223
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,166
- UHH, HEY.

224
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,708
THEY AREN'T HEADING OFF ALONE
TO ONE OF THE EMPTY CLASSROOMS,
ARE THEY?

225
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:05,916
- ( gasps )

226
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,458
- ( panting )

227
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,583
- FASTER, YUJI.
COME ON.

228
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,291
- I-- I'M--
I'M TRYING.

229
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:23,375
- Yuji: WHOA.  HOW DOES
SHANA RUN SO FAST WITH
THIS TINY STRIDE?

230
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,208
- ( screaming )
- SAKAI, WHAT THE HELL?!

231
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,125
- WHAT'S WRONG--
( gasps )

232
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,750
- HOLD IT.
DON'T LOOK.

233
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,625
- OH, COME ON. WHAT ARE YOU
COVERING HER EYES FOR?

234
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,041
OKAY, WE'RE SORRY.
WE'RE SORRY!

235
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,791
- ( sighs )
THAT WAS A DISASTER.

236
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,958
- GOING TO THE SCHOOL
WAS YOUR IDEA.

237
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,375
WE SAW PRACTICALLY
EVERYONE WE KNOW THERE.

238
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,000
- I DON'T SEE YOU 
COMING UP WITH ANY
BETTER IDEAS.

239
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,458
- AT THIS POINT I THINK
IT'LL BE FASTER TO GO

240
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,041
BACK TO YOUR PLACE.

241
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,041
LET'S HURRY THOUGH.

242
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,375
- ( sighs )

243
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,916
( sighs )

244
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,000
- Yuji: YOU KNOW,

245
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,500
THE SKIRT IS NICE AND COOL,

246
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:16,250
BUT THE PANTIES ARE FEELING
AWFUL TIGHT.

247
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,916
YEAH, SO HEY,

248
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,250
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,
WE CAN'T POSSIBLY

249
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,833
RUN INTO ANYONE ELSE,
CAN WE?

250
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,750
- DOUBTFUL.
ALTHOUGH WILHELMINA DID SAY

251
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,416
SHE WAS GOING ON
PATROL TODAY.

252
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,583
- Alastor: REMEMBER,
IF WE DO ENCOUNTER HER,

253
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,291
SHE MUST NOT LEARN
OF YOUR CURRENT SITUATION.

254
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:37,583
- WELL, YEAH.  YOU TOLD US 
THAT PART EARLIER, ALASTOR.

255
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,416
BUT WHY THE BIG SECRET?

256
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,708
HMM? ( gasps )

257
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,416
- YEAH?  WHAT NOW?

258
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,625
( gasps )

259
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,416
- ( slurps )

260
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,291
- MILADY.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SEARCHING

261
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,208
FOR THE HUNTER'S
TREASURE TOOLS. 

262
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,291
- Tiamat: DONE SO SOON?

263
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,791
- WELL, YOU SEE, WE--

264
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,708
- I WAS INDEED 
NOT ASKING YOU.

265
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,458
- UH--

266
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,958
- YEAH WELL, IT'S NOT THAT
WE'RE SLACKING OFF.

267
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,250
IT'S THAT WE--
- WORD CHOICE, MORON.

268
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,083
- MORON?
- Tiamat: WORD CHOICE?

269
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,125
- Alastor: UH, WE HAVE 
SOME IMPORTANT BUSINESS

270
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,625
TO ATTEND TO, DON'T WE?

271
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,000
LET'S GET A MOVE ON,
YOU TWO.

272
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,333
- YEAH, RIGHT.
IMPORTANT.

273
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:33,083
- SO WE'LL SEE YOU LATER,
WILHELMINA.

274
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,500
- ( both panting )

275
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,916
- ( gasps )
- Shana: OH NO, WASN'T THINKING.

276
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,833
THAT WAS PURE INSTINCT.
- ( gasps )

277
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:43,791
- ( grunts )

278
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,500
- WHOA, IS THE CIRCUS IN TOWN?

279
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,166
- SOME KIND OF
STREET PERFORMERS, I GUESS.

280
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,750
- THEY'RE NOT USING GUNS,
ARE THEY?

281
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,166
- Shana: DOUBLE STRIKE.

282
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,250
THAT ONE SHOULD HAVE
TAKEN YUJI OUT.

283
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,208
- ( gasps )

284
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,500
- WE DO NOT HAVE
TIME FOR THIS.

285
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,791
DAMMIT, WILHELMINA.
ALWAYS SO STUBBORN 
AND SUSPICIOUS.

286
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,500
- Tiamat: IMPROVED DEFENSES.

287
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,500
- INDEED.  ALTHOUGH,
TOO MUCH FOR EVEN HIM.

288
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,541
ON THE OTHER HAND,

289
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:13,125
IS IT POSSIBLE YOU'VE
GOTTEN THAT MUCH BETTER?

290
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:19,000
- WHAT-- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

291
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,541
- ( breathes deep )

292
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,375
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!

293
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,916
- UH...

294
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,166
- ( gasps )

295
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,625
- COME ON,
WE GOTTA GO.

296
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,958
- HEY, WHAT DID YOU
HAVE TO GO AND SAY 
THAT FOR?

297
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,791
- WELL, IT'S TRUE,
ISN'T IT?

298
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,291
BESIDES, IT WORKED.

299
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,958
- YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

300
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,083
IT'S JUST THAT...

301
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,625
- Tiamat:
A BOLD, BOLD STATEMENT.

302
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,416
- ( panting )

303
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,083
FINALLY, WE'RE HOME.

304
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,458
- DON'T STOP NOW.
LET'S GET INSIDE.

305
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,000
- YEAH.  YOU DON'T 
HAVE TO YELL AT ME.

306
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:05,166
I HAVE TROUBLE RUSHING
IN THIS BODY.

307
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,083
- YOU'RE ONLY TIRED BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT USING

308
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,333
YOUR POWER OF EXISTENCE
THE RIGHT WAY.

309
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,375
I'M HOME.

310
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,500
- WHATEVER.

311
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,750
WE RAN ALL THIS WAY.

312
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,250
WHY WOULD WE RUSH NOW?

313
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,875
- ( grunts )

314
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:21,833
- UHH...

315
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,916
- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
GET A MOVE ON.

316
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,833
- OKAY.  FINE.

317
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,625
- Yuji:
SHE ALMOST COLLAPSED THERE.

318
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:36,250
COULD IT BE SOME
KIND OF SIDE EFFECT
OF THE TREASURE TOOL?

319
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,458
IF IT IS...

320
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,583
- Chigusa: OH HEY, YUJI,
YOU'RE HOME.

321
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,625
I THOUGHT YOU KIDS WERE
GONNA BE OUT LATE.

322
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,041
- OUR PLANS CHANGED.

323
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,625
- OH.

324
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,833
LOOK AT YOU, SHANA,
YOU'RE ALL SWEATY. 

325
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,041
YOU CAN TAKE
A BATH IF YOU'D LIKE.

326
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,458
- WELL, I'M KIND OF
PRESSED FOR TIME-- 

327
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:54,416
( gasps )

328
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:01,541
YEAH, I DEFINITELY
CAN'T DO THAT TODAY.

329
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,208
- HUH?
- HURRY UP!

330
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,500
- ( gasps )

331
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,333
- HUH.

332
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,958
- ( gasps )
SHANA,

333
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,416
WHY ARE YOU SO PALE
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

334
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,083
MY BODY CAN'T
HANDLE THE STRAIN

335
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,916
'CAUSE WE HAVEN'T 
SWITCHED BACK YET.

336
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,833
ALASTOR, WHY DIDN'T YOU
WARN US ABOUT THIS SOONER?

337
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:22,083
- Alastor: I--
THERE'S NO REASON.

338
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:26,166
- Yuji: RESHUFFLE MUST HAVE
SIDE EFFECTS EVEN ALASTOR
DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT.

339
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,416
MAYBE IT ACTS DIFFERENTLY 
WHEN A FLAME HAZE USES IT.

340
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,083
JUST TO BE SAFE...
ALASTOR, HEY.

341
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,916
WE'LL SWITCH BACK 
IF WE LOOK THROUGH

342
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,083
THE TREASURE TOOL AGAIN,
RIGHT?

343
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,666
- Alastor: UH, YES.

344
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,458
- JUST HANG ON, SHANA. 
I'LL FIND IT RIGHT NOW.

345
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,833
( grunts )
RELEASE ITEMS.

346
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,125
- IDIOT!

347
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,125
- ( gasps )
AAH!

348
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,666
- ( crashing )
- HMM?

349
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,000
- ( grunts )

350
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:09,708
I HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL
OVER YUJI'S BODY RIGHT NOW.

351
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,500
IF I WANTED, I COULD...

352
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,083
- Chigusa: YUJI? SHANA?

353
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,166
- ( gasps )
- WHAT WAS ALL THAT RACKET?

354
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,666
- Shana:
I'M SO STUPID.

355
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,750
THERE'S NO POINT
IF HE DOESN'T DO IT TOO.

356
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,375
- Chigusa: KIDS, YOU OKAY?

357
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,625
- CAST A SEAL.

358
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,166
YUJI.  YUJI, WAKE UP.

359
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,583
- ( groans )
WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED?

360
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,583
( gasps )
SHANA, YOU'RE FEELING OKAY?

361
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:05,583
- MM-HMM.  IT SEEMS TO
HAVE SUBSIDED FOR NOW.

362
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,750
NOW PUT ALL OF THIS STUFF AWAY
SO WE HAVE SOME ROOM TO MOVE. 

363
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,458
- UH. YEAH, RIGHT.

364
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,375
( grunts )

365
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,208
- ( gasps )

366
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,166
( grunts )

367
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,666
( sighs )

368
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,291
- HERE.

369
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,916
- HUH?
- Alastor: EXCELLENT, SHANA.

370
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,625
- QUICK, LET'S SWITCH BACK.

371
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,583
- OKAY. PREPARE YOURSELF, YUJI.
- HUH?

372
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,625
- ( sighs )

373
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,625
( gasps )

374
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,375
BACK TO NORMAL.

375
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,791
- MM-HMM.

376
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,208
AND ALL IS WELL.

377
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,000
- ( stomach growls )
- ( groans )

378
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,208
- ( giggles )

379
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,000
- SHANA, THIS IS--

380
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,000
- I'D MAKE A RUN FOR IT
IF I WERE YOU.

381
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,416
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
THAT'S WHAT WAS WRONG WITH--

382
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,250
( gasps )

383
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,833
MOVE, MA!

384
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,458
( yelps )

385
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,416
- ( laughing )

386
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,500
- Alastor: LET ME GUESS,
IT WAS THE ICE CREAM, RIGHT?

387
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,416
- MM-HMM.
YUJI'S BODY IS TOTALLY WEAK.

388
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,541
HIS STOMACH STARTED CHURNING
AFTER JUST A FEW DOZEN SERVINGS.

389
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,250
- OH, GOOD.
YOU HAD ME WORRIED THERE.

390
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,000
- ( chuckles )
SORRY.

391
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,000
ALL RIGHT.

392
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,666
SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

393
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,833
HOW COME NOBODY COULD KNOW
WE'D GOTTEN OUR MINDS

394
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,041
SWITCHED WITH THIS THING?

395
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,875
IT'S NOT LIKE I'D
WANT TO USE IT AGAIN,

396
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,708
BUT I CAN SEE HOW IT MIGHT
COME IN HANDY SOME DAY.

397
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,791
BUT, SINCE FRIAGNE THE HUNTER
NEVER USED IT,

398
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,875
I'M GUESSING THERE HAS TO BE
SOME KIND OF CATCH INVOLVED.

399
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:54,291
- Alastor: ONCE I TELL YOU,
PROMISE TO DESTROY IT.

400
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,708
I'LL ONLY SAY THIS ONCE.

401
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,375
RESHUFFLE'S EFFECT
ONLY TOOK HOLD

402
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,291
BECAUSE THERE IS NO WALL
BETWEEN YOUR HEARTS.

403
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:05,708
WE CANNOT LET THE OTHERS
KNOW THAT WALL HAS COME 
CRASHING DOWN.

404
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,541
TO BE HONEST, I WAS EVEN
AFRAID TO ADMIT IT MYSELF.

405
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,291
- HMM?

406
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,708
- Alastor: WE COULDN'T DARE
TELL WILHELMINA CARMEL

407
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,958
HOW CLOSE YOU AND YUJI
HAVE BECOME.

408
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,291
LET ALONE
THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES,

409
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,375
AND HER TWO YOUNG FLUNKIES.

410
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:21,791
- ( gasps )

411
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,125
BUT YUJI AND I DON'T...

412
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,583
( groans )

413
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,583
- Alastor: DO NOT DENY IT
ANYMORE, SHANA.

414
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:29,500
I'VE TRIED LONG ENOUGH,
BUT WE MUST FACE FACTS.

415
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,416
YOU TWO DID SWITCH PLACES,

416
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,166
AND THAT WAS
THE PREREQUISITE.

417
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,916
- NO WAY.  THERE MUST BE
SOME KIND OF MISTAKE.

418
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,333
- Alastor: WE'RE STILL INSIDE
THE SEAL YOU CAST.

419
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:41,833
I WOULD SAVE YOUR EXCUSES 
FOR THE LADY OF THE HOUSE.

420
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,416
- ( murmurs )

421
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,250
- WHAT ON EARTH
HAPPENED IN HERE?

422
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,083
- WE JUST HAD
A LITTLE FIGHT.

423
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:52,333
- A LITTLE FIGHT,
AND THIS BIG MESS
IS THE RESULT?

424
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,500
DID YUJI INSTIGATE IT?

425
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,500
DON'T TELL ME
YOU CAUSED ALL THIS.

426
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,750
- I...

427
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:00,333
YUJI.

428
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:02,333
IT WAS ALL YUJI'S FAULT.

429
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:03,875
( sighs )

430
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:11,166
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )
