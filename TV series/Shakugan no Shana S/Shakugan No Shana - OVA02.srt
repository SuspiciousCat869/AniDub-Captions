1
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,333
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,375
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,583
- ( sighs )

4
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:04,958
- Tiamat: PUT SOME LIGHT ON.

5
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,000
- ( clock ticking )

6
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,500
( dings )

7
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,166
- SHE IS RUNNING
QUITE LATE.

8
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,541
- Tiamat:
THINGS DO COME UP.

9
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:25,625
- INDEED.

10
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,583
OVER THE PAST
FEW WEEKS THOUGH,

11
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,166
"THINGS" HAVE "COME UP"

12
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,583
WITH A SOMEWHAT
ALARMING FREQUENCY.

13
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,541
- ( door opening )

14
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,791
- WELCOME HOME, MILADY.

15
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,208
- Tiamat:
WE'VE BEEN WAITING.

16
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,750
- WELL, I'M BACK.

17
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,208
- INDEED YOU ARE.

18
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,625
LATER AND LATER
IT SEEMS THESE DAYS.

19
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,083
- Tiamat:
UP TO NO GOOD?

20
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,833
- ( sighs )

21
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,208
SORRY I'M LATE.
SOMETHING CAME UP.

22
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,375
- "SOMETHING"?
THAT'S RATHER VAGUE.

23
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,541
- Tiamat:
AS CLEAR AS MUD.

24
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:01,791
- Alastor:
ALL RIGHT, LADIES,

25
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,125
NO NEED TO INTERROGATE HER

26
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,958
AS SOON AS SHE
COMES IN THE DOOR.

27
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,458
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

28
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,083
LET HER CLEAN UP
AND CHANGE CLOTHES FIRST.

29
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,208
WE'LL CONTINUE THIS LATER.
DINNER IS SOON, YES?

30
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,166
- YEAH, SO, LATER.

31
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,250
- ( sighs )

32
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,833
- Wilhelmina: THAT IS INDEED
HOW IT PLAYED OUT.

33
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,500
SINCE THAT TIME,
SHE HASN'T SAID A WORD,

34
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,250
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
I PLEAD.

35
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,166
ADDITIONALLY,
THE FLA--

36
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,666
UH... I MEAN...

37
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,916
I SPOKE WITH HER
OTHER GUARDIAN, 

38
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,916
AND HE SEEMS TO BE
COVERING FOR HER. 

39
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,875
- MR. ALASTOR?
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

40
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:00,791
- ( dings )

41
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,541
- YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT HER.

42
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,041
- ( gasps )

43
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,125
- WELL, OF COURSE.
THAT'S ONLY NATURAL.

44
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,125
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SHANA
TO JUST STOP TALKING TO YOU.

45
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,291
- ( sighs )
- IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD.

46
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:22,041
I'VE SPENT QUITE A GOOD DEAL
OF TIME WITH HER THIS YEAR, 

47
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,708
AND I WOULD SAY THAT
I UNDERSTAND HER

48
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,666
REASONABLY WELL,
I THINK.

49
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,875
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN,

50
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,291
SHE ISN'T THE KIND OF GIRL
WHO WOULD HIDE SOMETHING, 

51
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,708
NOT FROM SOMEONE
SHE DEEPLY CARES ABOUT,

52
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,541
JUST FOR THE SAKE
OF BEING DECEITFUL.

53
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,041
- INDEED.

54
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,458
- SO IF SHE IS HIDING
SOMETHING FROM YOU,

55
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,458
I'M SURE THERE'S A PERFECTLY
GOOD REASON FOR IT.

56
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:52,083
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY
A LESS "IN YOUR FACE"
APPROACH.

57
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,041
- HUH?

58
00:05:58,916 --> 00:05:59,958
- ( dings )

59
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,166
- WELL...

60
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,333
IF YOU'RE REALLY
THAT CONCERNED, 

61
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,166
MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE
CAN ASK HER FOR YOU.

62
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,125
- ( gasps )

63
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:23,333
- Wilhelmina:
I KNOW IT WAS CHIGUSA
WHO RECOMMENDED THIS,

64
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,625
BUT HIM?

65
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,000
- Tiamat:
SADLY, WE NEED HIM.

66
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,208
- WHY CAN'T I JUST
ASK HER OUTRIGHT

67
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:32,208
INSTEAD OF ALL THIS
CLOAK AND DAGGER NONSENSE?

68
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,541
OR WAS THAT PART
MY MOM'S IDEA TOO?

69
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,958
- I AM ATTEMPTING
A MORE HANDS-OFF APPROACH.

70
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:40,375
INDEED, DIRECT CONTACT 
HAS ONLY PUT HER ON THE
DEFENSIVE.

71
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:44,791
JUST BE CAREFUL,
AND TRY TO MASK YOUR PRESENCE.

72
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:48,208
- Tiamat: FOCUS.
- RIGHT.  FOCUS.

73
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,916
- Wilhelmina: ANY CHANGE
IN HER BEHAVIOR AT SCHOOL?

74
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,125
- NO, NOT REALLY.

75
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,125
- IS THERE INDEED NO CHANGE?

76
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,958
OR ARE YOU SIMPLY
NOT NOTICING?

77
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,708
- NO, YOU'VE GOT IT
ALL WRONG.

78
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,666
NOT A DAY GOES BY
THAT I DON'T NOTICE SHANA--

79
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,500
( clears throat )

80
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,833
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW SHE WAS
HIDING ANYTHING FROM YOU, 

81
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,000
OR THAT SHE WASN'T
GOING STRAIGHT HOME.

82
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,000
YOU WERE WATCHING US,
WEREN'T YOU?

83
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,125
WE SPLIT UP AT THE SAME PLACE
WE ALWAYS DO.

84
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,416
SEE YOU, SHANA.

85
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,958
- BYE.

86
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,625
- SO, YEAH.

87
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,458
I GUESS THAT MEANS SHE'S
HIDING SOMETHING FROM ME TOO.

88
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,458
- ( sighs )
- Tiamat: IT WOULD SEEM SO.

89
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,458
- Wilhelmina:
PERHAPS THE MADAM'S 
CHOICE OF ACCOMPLICE

90
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,375
IS INDEED APPROPRIATE.

91
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:05,041
- MAYBE SHE TOOK
A LITTLE DETOUR?

92
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,583
I'M SURE YOU'RE
MISTAKEN TO WORRY ABOUT--

93
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,333
- ( groans )

94
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,708
- OR NOT.  IT'S COOL.

95
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,875
- THESE "LITTLE THINGS,"

96
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:16,041
IGNORING THEM INDEED
COMES BACK TO HAUNT YOU.

97
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,708
- Tiamat:
LITTLE THINGS MATTER.

98
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,916
- YES, YOU'RE RIGHT.
OF COURSE.

99
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,875
- HER DELINQUENCY
IS TROUBLING.

100
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,875
IF IT COMES AS A RESULT
OF HER CURRENT LIFESTYLE,

101
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:28,375
THEN I MAY INDEED
BE FORCED TO REASSESS

102
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,166
THE WAY SHE'S ALLOWED
TO INTERACT IN THIS WORLD.

103
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,083
- "REASSESS"?
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

104
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,000
HANG ON,
YOU'RE NOT THINKING

105
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,291
ABOUT MAKING HER
QUIT SCHOOL, ARE YOU?

106
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,291
- YES, I AM.

107
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,166
THIS ISN'T ABOUT HER.

108
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,083
IT'S ABOUT PROTECTING
THE TREASURE TOOL INSIDE YOU.

109
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,208
- OH, MAN.

110
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:51,083
- END OF CONVERSATION.

111
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:54,083
INDEED, NOW IS THE TIME
FOR ACTION, NOT TALK.

112
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,500
- FINE.

113
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,083
UH...

114
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,750
- Wilhelmina:
WHAT IS THE MATTER NOW?

115
00:08:58,833 --> 00:08:59,750
- Tiamat:
SPIT IT OUT, YOUNG MAN.

116
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,875
- YEAH, SORRY.
GUESS I LOST TRACK OF HER.

117
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,500
- Wilhelmina: SO YOU'RE SAYING
IT WASN'T THAT YOU WERE UNABLE

118
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,000
TO SENSE HER PRESENCE,
IT'S THAT SHE HAD INTENTIONALLY

119
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,875
CONCEALED IT FROM YOU?
- YEAH.

120
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,708
SUDDENLY, IT JUST VANISHED.

121
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:18,541
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON I KNOW 
WHO CAN DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

122
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,541
- A LOGICAL DEDUCTION,
INDEED.

123
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,541
- ( doorbell rings )
- Sato: YEAH?

124
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,375
- HEY, IS MARGERY HOME?
WE NEED TO ASK HER SOMETHING.

125
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,125
- YEAH.  THE THING IS,

126
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,125
SHE'S BEEN HITTING
THE BOTTLE SINCE NOON.

127
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:34,125
THREATENED DEATH IF I WOKE HER
FOR ANYTHING BUT A DENIZEN.

128
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,958
SO, UNLESS IT'S SOME KIND OF
EMERGENCY OR SOMETHING...

129
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,541
- IT IS, INDEED.
- Tiamat: HIGH PRIORITY.

130
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,333
- WHAT?  WILHELMINA.

131
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,166
- WHAT'S THE ISSUE?
- Tiamat: CARE TO JOIN US?

132
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,125
- ( sighs )

133
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:56,166
- WAS IT NOT INDEED
YOUR IDEA TO COME HERE?

134
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,166
- LISTEN, I CAN TELL
FROM HOW SATO'S ACTING,

135
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,583
WHATEVER'S GOING ON,
MARGERY'S TOTALLY IN ON IT.

136
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,916
THOSE TWO ARE USUALLY
AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS

137
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,583
LIKE CATS AND DOGS,

138
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,583
WHICH MEANS THEY'RE DOING
SOMEONE ELSE A FAVOR.

139
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,541
AND THAT SOMEONE
WANTED US TO COME HERE.

140
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,375
IT WAS ALL
PART OF THE PLAN.

141
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,750
IF WE DID TALK TO MARGERY,
SHE'D PROBABLY JUST LIE TO US

142
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,583
OR LEAD US IN CIRCLES.

143
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,125
AND SINCE THE DIRECT APPROACH
HASN'T BEEN WORKING,

144
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,041
LET'S TRY IT
THE SNEAKY WAY.

145
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,625
NOTHING.
NOT A TRACE OF HER.

146
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,541
- Wilhelmina:
I'D SAY THAT'S NOT SURPRISING

147
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:49,041
SINCE SHE'S CONCEALING
HER PRESENCE FROM US. 

148
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,666
- Tiamat: OBVIOUSLY.

149
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,041
- THANK GOODNESS.

150
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,625
- HMM?

151
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:55,958
- UH, NO...

152
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,208
NOT THANK GOODNESS
ABOUT HER HIDING. 

153
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,041
I MEAN, SINCE THE TUNING,

154
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:05,000
NO OTHER TORCHES HAVE
SHOWN UP BESIDES ME. 

155
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,208
- Wilhelmina:
THOSE WERE TRUE WORDS OF RELIEF.

156
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,875
I DETECTED NO TRACE
OF SELFISHNESS

157
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,875
OR SELF PITY.

158
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,625
NO ENVY OR SCORN
TOWARDS OTHERS. 

159
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,708
HOW CAN HE PERCEIVE
THE WORLD THE WAY HE DOES?

160
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,833
IS IT POSSIBLE HE IS
THAT RARE TYPE OF PERSON

161
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:25,083
FOR WHOM MOTIVATION
IS NOT DRIVEN BY EMOTION,

162
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,583
NO MATTER WHAT PERIL
HE MAY BE FACING?

163
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,916
IF SO, IT EXPLAINS

164
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,250
WHY HE IS SLOW TO REACT 
IN TYPICALLY EMOTIONALLY
CHARGED SITUATIONS.

165
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,666
- Tiamat:
IS THAT TOO EASY?

166
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,208
- ( gasps )

167
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,750
INDEED.

168
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,916
I HAVE PLENTY OF TIME 
TO SOLVE THAT MYSTERY.

169
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,333
- WILHELMINA, WHAT ABOUT HER
UNRESTRICTED SPELL?

170
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,083
SHE CAN'T HIDE ITS ENERGY,
SO IF SHE'S USING IT,

171
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,666
WE'LL BE ABLE TO FIND HER.

172
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,041
- LET'S SEE WHAT
I CAN REVEAL.

173
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,000
- ( both gasp )

174
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,500
- WHO CAST ALL THESE? 
MARGERY, I'M GUESSING?

175
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,583
- IT WOULD INDEED SEEM SO.

176
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,208
- Yuji: SEE YOU, WILHELMINA.

177
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,000
I'LL BE SURE TO ASK HER
AT SCHOOL TOMORROW.

178
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,583
DON'T WORRY,

179
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,958
I'M SURE SHE'S NOT 
DOING ANYTHING BAD.

180
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,208
IF IT'S SOME KIND OF SECRET,

181
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,541
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO
GET HER TO LET ME IN ON IT.

182
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,333
- Ogata: SORRY, SAKAI.

183
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,875
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN TODAY.

184
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,875
- HUH?

185
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,833
- WE'RE STEALING SHANA
AWAY FROM YOU

186
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,083
SO THE THREE OF US CAN
GO SHOPPING TOGETHER. 

187
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,750
- YEP. NO BOYS ALLOWED.

188
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,291
SORRY.

189
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,291
- UH...

190
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,083
- ( sighs )

191
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,666
FIRST SATO,

192
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,750
AND NOW YOSHIDA AND OGATA
ARE IN ON...

193
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,375
SHANA'S BIG SECRET.

194
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:23,458
MAYBE THEY'RE PLANNING
LIKE A SURPRISE PARTY 

195
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,791
FOR WILHELMINA OR SOMETHING.

196
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,916
BUT WHY WOULDN'T THEY
TELL ME?

197
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,958
I GUESS THEY THOUGHT THAT
IF WILHELMINA THREATENED ME,

198
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,000
I'D CAVE AND SPILL THE BEANS.

199
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,791
NAH.  MIGHT BE GETTING
AHEAD OF MYSELF

200
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,458
ON THE WHOLE "PARTY" THEORY.

201
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,583
- Ike: MAN, YOU'RE EVEN
WALKING HOME ALONE?

202
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:46,166
LOOKED LIKE SHANA SPENT
THE WHOLE DAY TRYING TO
AVOID YOU.

203
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,750
- UM, YEAH.

204
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,791
IT'S LIKE THERE'S
SOME KIND OF BIG SECRET.

205
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,375
EVERYONE I TRY
AND ASK ABOUT IT

206
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,208
JUST DODGES THE QUESTION.

207
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,750
I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD ANYTHING?

208
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:59,041
I DON'T KNOW,
LIKE A SURPRISE PARTY

209
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,375
THEY'RE THROWING FOR
WILHELMINA OR SOMETHING?

210
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,708
- UH...

211
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,125
NO, UH-UH.

212
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,416
BUT YOU DO HAVE TO WONDER,

213
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,416
IF I'M IN ON IT TOO,

214
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,250
WOULD I REALLY GIVE YOU
A TRUTHFUL ANSWER?

215
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,416
OR WOULD I TRY AND
THROW YOU OFF,

216
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,416
AND THEN JUST REPORT
EVERYTHING BACK TO SHANA?

217
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,416
QUITE A CONUNDRUM.

218
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,375
- UH...

219
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,250
- Wilhelmina:
I WOULD LIKE AN EXPLANATION.

220
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,708
WHAT REASON WOULD THEY HAVE
TO BE IN SUCH AN ESTABLISHMENT?

221
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,750
- Yuji: WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"REASON"?

222
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,166
THEY'RE JUST HERE TO SHOP.

223
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,500
- THE PURCHASE OF FOOD STUFFS

224
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,416
AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED
HOUSEHOLD ITEMS

225
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,000
IS MY RESPONSIBILITY.

226
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,375
- Tiamat:
SHE RUNS A TIGHT SHIP.

227
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,250
- ( chuckles )

228
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,583
- WHAT IS FUNNY?

229
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,250
- OH, NOTHING.

230
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,541
I WAS JUST THINKING
THAT THIS KIND OF REMINDS ME

231
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,458
OF BACK WHEN
SHE AND I FIRST MET.

232
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,625
HEY, WILHELMINA,

233
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,958
YOU'D PREFER IF SHE WENT BACK
TO THE WAY SHE WAS, HUH?

234
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:57,291
THE DEAD SERIOUS FLAME HAZE
I MET THAT DAY.

235
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,958
WAS SHE ALWAYS LIKE THAT,

236
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,541
EVEN WHEN SHE WAS
A LITTLE GIRL?

237
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,208
- OH, YES, INDEED.

238
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,958
SERIOUS DEMEANOR ON MISSIONS,
TRAINING EVERY DAY,

239
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,291
SELF-DISCIPLINE--

240
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,041
THAT HAS NO BEARING
ON ANY OF THIS.

241
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,416
- Tiamat: INCONSEQUENTIAL.

242
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,583
- HUH?
- WILHELMINA, HOLD ON.

243
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,708
DON'T YOU STAND OUT A BIT?

244
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:26,291
- ( sighs )
- UM, NOT THAT YOU LOOK BAD.

245
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,250
BUT DON'T YOU EVER 
WEAR ANYTHING ELSE?

246
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,083
- I REQUESTED A GARMENT
WORN BY THOSE WHO WORK 

247
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,750
IN THE SERVICE OF NOBLES.

248
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:37,333
THIS IS INDEED THE STYLE 
I WAS TOLD I SHOULD WEAR.

249
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:40,333
I FIND IT BOTH
FUNCTIONAL AND COMFORTABLE.

250
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,250
THEREFORE,
I HAVE CHOSEN TO WEAR IT

251
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,916
EVER SINCE LEAVING
TENDOU-KYU.

252
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,500
- SO WHEN--
WHEN IT WAS JUST
THE TWO OF YOU, 

253
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,000
OR FOUR, I GUESS,

254
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,750
DID YOU GUYS EVER
GET BORED OR LONELY?

255
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,083
LIKE AROUND THE HOLIDAYS
AND STUFF?

256
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,666
- THERE WERE FIVE OF US.

257
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,500
- UH-- REALLY?

258
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,333
- ( clears throat )
NOW BE SILENT, BOY.

259
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,750
- Tiamat: MANNERS.

260
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:02,750
- SORRY.

261
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,916
- DID WE GET EVERYTHING?

262
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,541
- UM, YEAH.
I THINK WE DID.

263
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,125
- Ogata:
WELL SHANA, GOOD LUCK.

264
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,625
- Shana:
THANKS AGAIN, BOTH OF YOU.

265
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,541
- I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE SHE WAS JUST

266
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,000
TAGGING ALONG WITH
THE OTHER TWO.

267
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,791
- 'KAY, BETTER RUN.
SEE YOU.

268
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,375
- UH, WILHELMINA?

269
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,750
AAH!

270
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,666
( grunts )

271
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,375
( coughs )
- I SAID BE SILENT.

272
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,333
- Tiamat:
SHE SAID IT TWICE NOW.

273
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,541
- WE SHOULD INDEED
FOLLOW HER FROM ABOVE

274
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,750
SO WE DON'T LOSE
VISUAL CONTACT. 

275
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,166
- ( grunts )

276
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,583
- Wilhelmina:
WHY IS SHE GOING THIS FAR?

277
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,125
- Yuji:
WHY ARE YOU GOING THIS FAR?

278
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,791
I DON'T GET IT.

279
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:59,333
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU DON'T TRUST HER. 

280
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,916
AND YOU ALSO KNOW
SHE DOESN'T TAKE 

281
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,166
THE DUTIES OF
A FLAME HAZE LIGHTLY.

282
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,916
SO I DON'T GET IT.

283
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,500
THIS ONE TIME,
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST LET IT GO?

284
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,583
- REGRET.
- WHAT?

285
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,000
- I DON'T WANT HER
TO GET HURT.

286
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:22,416
BECAUSE KEEPING FOOLISH SECRETS
ONLY CAUSES REGRET.

287
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,416
I KNOW THAT PAIN
FROM ALL THE SECRETS

288
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,000
I KEPT FROM THE ENGAGED LINK.

289
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,541
SO I WORRY.

290
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,208
HOW WILL THIS AFFECT HER?

291
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:38,375
HAS SHE NOT BEGUN
TO FEEL REGRET

292
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,166
OVER KEEPING SECRETS,
EVEN SMALL ONES?

293
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,958
- WILHELMINA...

294
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,625
Yuji: HONESTLY,
I THINK SHE HAS CHANGED

295
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,625
SINCE I FIRST MET HER.

296
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,791
HAVING LIVED HERE
FOR A WHILE,

297
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,833
IT'S LIKE SHE'S...

298
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,458
SHE'S...

299
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,166
MATURED.

300
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,708
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE

301
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,791
SHE'S FACED THE SAME
FEARS AS YOU,

302
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,458
AND SOME YOU HAVEN'T.

303
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,666
BUT SOMEWHERE IN
ALL THAT CHAOS, 

304
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,833
SHE FOUND SOMETHING
SHE CARES ABOUT

305
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,166
TO HOLD ONTO.

306
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,083
EVEN RIGHT NOW TOO,
I'LL BET.

307
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,041
- ( sighs )

308
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,250
- HIDEY-HO!

309
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:32,333
SO, I HEARD YOU TWO
DROPPED BY EARLIER 
WHILE I WAS ASLEEP.

310
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,750
- Marcosias:
( laughing )

311
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,666
I THINK "BLACKED OUT"
IS WHAT YOU MEAN.

312
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,500
- SHUT UP, STUPID MARCO.

313
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,500
( groans )

314
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,750
- WHAT IS THIS INDEED
ALL ABOUT?

315
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,208
- WHAT IS WHAT ALL ABOUT?

316
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,583
- WELL, TO BEGIN WITH,

317
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,666
DID YOU GIVE HER A BOOKMARK
THAT CAN CONCEAL HER
PRESENCE FROM US?

318
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,541
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
I KNOW WHO CAN DO THAT.

319
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,833
- HUH?  WHO IS "HER"?

320
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,291
- Marcosias:  SHEESH. 
YEAH, WE GAVE HER ONE.

321
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,791
SHE ASKED FOR IT.

322
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,625
GUESS IT'S ALL THE RAGE
THESE DAYS

323
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,291
FOR YOUNGSTERS TO
SNEAK AROUND

324
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,875
BEHIND THEIR PARENTAL-TYPES'
BACKS AFTER SCHOOL.

325
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,375
( chuckles )
- Tiamat: YOU'RE NOT HELPFUL.

326
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,375
- WHICH INDEED
BEGS THE QUESTION,

327
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,208
WHY IS SOMEONE LIKE YOU
HELPING IN A MATTER LIKE THIS?

328
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,625
- BECAUSE SOMEONE LIKE ME

329
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,166
WAS IN THE MOOD
TO DO SOMETHING NICE.

330
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,791
- Marcosias: I DON'T SEE
WHY WE'RE IN TROUBLE

331
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,708
FOR GIVING HER A MEASLY
LITTLE BOOKMARK.

332
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,708
OH RIGHT, THE SUPER POWERFUL
UNRESTRICTED SPELL ON IT.

333
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,250
( laughing )

334
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,541
- SORRY.  RUNNING BEHIND.

335
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,708
- IT'S OKAY.
- BUT DON'T STOP NOW.

336
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,166
IT'S ALMOST TIME.
- I KNOW.

337
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,666
- YOU PRACTICED 
FOR A WHOLE WEEK

338
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,416
TO GET ALL OF THIS
DOWN PAT.

339
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,000
WE HAVE TO FINISH EVERYTHING
BEFORE WILHELMINA GETS HOME.

340
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,416
- OTHERWISE, IT WON'T BE
MUCH OF A SURPRISE.

341
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,333
- RIGHT.

342
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,416
- HEY, BY THE WAY,

343
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,083
WHAT <i>IS</i> TODAY?

344
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,000
I MEAN, WHAT MAKES IT
SO SIGNIFICANT FOR WILHELMINA?

345
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,333
- I'M NOT SURE.
ALL I KNOW IS THAT

346
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,916
I HEARD WILHELMINA MENTION
IT WAS A SPECIAL DAY.

347
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,791
- IS IT HER BIRTHDAY?
- I DON'T THINK SO.

348
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,208
- WELL, WHATEVER.

349
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,833
IT'S SPECIAL IS
ALL THAT MATTERS.

350
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,333
- ( gasps )

351
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,500
- KAZUMI, WHAT IS IT?

352
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,833
- THE FLOUR.

353
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,875
THE KIND YOU GOT IS WRONG.

354
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:13,833
- ( both gasp )

355
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,083
- SEE?  WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

356
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,791
I KNEW SHE'D
PLAY DUMB WITH US.

357
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,375
WE NEED PROOF.

358
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,375
THAT WAY SHE CAN'T WEASEL
OUT OF TELLING US

359
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,208
WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW.

360
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,291
- I WILL INDEED GET
A STRAIGHT ANSWER

361
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,791
OUT OF YOU AT SOME POINT.

362
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:29,916
- Tiamat: LIKE IT OR NOT.

363
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,083
- ( chuckles )

364
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,083
- ( yelps )

365
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,541
( screams )

366
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,291
- ( chuckles )

367
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,458
YES?  SOMETHING UP?

368
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,208
- Kazumi: I'M SO SORRY,
MARGERY,

369
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,625
BUT WE'VE HAD A MIX-UP
WITH THE GROCERY SHOPPING.

370
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,208
CAN YOU PLEASE BUY US
A LITTLE MORE TIME?

371
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:56,333
15 MINUTES SHOULD BE
ABOUT RIGHT.

372
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:59,625
- Tanaka:
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

373
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,000
I CAN'T HOLD OFF WILHELMINA
ALL BY MYSELF.

374
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,583
- Margery:
NO CHOICE, KIDDO.

375
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,916
WE'RE NOT GOING DOWN
THIS LATE IN THE GAME.

376
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,125
- YEAH, BUT-- 
- ( crashing )

377
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,583
- ( gasps )

378
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,500
- ( grunts )
I KNEW IT.

379
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,416
YOU'VE HAD ME FOLLOWING
WILHELMINA AROUND

380
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,250
SO YOU COULD TRACK
WHERE SHE IS.

381
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,250
- ( murmurs )

382
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:22,166
- Yuji:
SO TANAKA WAS IN CHARGE OF

383
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,416
REPORTING OUR MOVEMENTS
BACK TO SHANA.

384
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,083
THAT MEANS THE PERSON 
WHO SET US UP TOGETHER

385
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,500
IS IN ON IT TOO.

386
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,125
MY MOM.

387
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,541
- SO SORRY, YUJI.

388
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,291
- ( sighs )

389
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,833
THIS IS JUST CRUEL.

390
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,333
WHAT THE HECK ARE
YOU GUYS PLANNING ALREADY?

391
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,833
- OKAY, FINE.
I'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

392
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:45,708
IT ALL BEGAN
ON A COLD WINTER'S MORN.

393
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,708
ICY WIND UPON MY CHEEK.

394
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,958
THE WIND WAS SO STRONG,
EVERY TREE IN TOWN

395
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,708
HAD ALL THEIR LEAVES
BLOWN OFF.

396
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,125
EVERY ONE,
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

397
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,333
IT WAS LIKE...

398
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,041
REALLY REALLY COLD.

399
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,291
OR, UM...

400
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,875
WAS IT A SUMMER AFTERNOON.

401
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,708
YES, WITH THE HOT SUN
BEATING DOWN.

402
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,750
I REMEMBER THE WATERMELON
WAS PARTICULARLY GOOD THAT DAY.

403
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,541
OH, SILLY ME,

404
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,041
IT WAS SPRING.

405
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,708
I'M SORRY, NO, AUTUMN,

406
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,083
MIDNIGHT IN MONSOON SEASON,

407
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,875
WHEN SATO SAID TO ME

408
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,291
"HEY, HUNGRY, BRO?"

409
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,708
TO WHICH I REPLIED

410
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,333
"YEAH, DUDE."

411
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,333
I HAD CROQUETTE SOBA.

412
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,916
SATO HAD SALMON RICE,
AND OGATA...

413
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,750
SHE WENT WITH THE OMELET.

414
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,166
AND AFTER THAT--!

415
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,750
- IS THERE INDEED
A POINT HERE?

416
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,333
- Tiamat: SPIT IT OUT.

417
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:36,916
- WELL, YOU SEE...

418
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,291
I, UM...

419
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,875
- ( gasps )
WE'RE BACK.

420
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,416
- ( murmurs )

421
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,041
- ( phone rings )

422
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,250
- ( chuckles nervously )
- ( phone beeps )

423
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,666
OH, THANK GOD.

424
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,208
SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.

425
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:57,500
ALASTOR AND MARGERY
CAN EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

426
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,166
FOR REAL THIS TIME.

427
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,333
PLEASE, IF YOU WOULD 
MAKE YOUR WAY BACK TO

428
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:02,666
THE HIRAI RESIDENCE.

429
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,791
- ALASTOR?
- HIRAI RESIDENCE?

430
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:06,791
- Tiamat: SOUNDS SUSPICIOUS.

431
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:11,291
- TELL HER I EXPECT TO BE
WELL PAID FOR ALL THIS.

432
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:16,208
- Wilhelmina: WE INDEED TOOK
THE SCENIC ROUTE TO
GET TO THE ANSWER. 

433
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,166
- ( Yuji sighs )

434
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:23,541
- Kazumi and Ogata:
WELCOME HOME, WILHELMINA.

435
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:26,000
- Yuji: YOSHIDA, OGATA?

436
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,791
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

437
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,125
- COME IN AND HAVE A SEAT.

438
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,625
WE'LL TELL YOU MORE THERE.

439
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:34,875
- OH, YOU CAN COME TOO,
SAKAI.

440
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,791
- OHH...

441
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:44,625
- WELCOME HOME.

442
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,000
- JEEZ. TRYING TO HIDE
SOMETHING FROM YOU IS TOUGH.

443
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,375
I GUESS WE'RE JUST LUCKY
NOBODY GOT HURT.

444
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,166
WE STUCK YUJI ON YOU

445
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,000
AS SOON AS WE KNEW
YOU WERE SUSPICIOUS.

446
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,125
ALL OF US KNEW WHERE
YOU WERE AT ALL TIMES.

447
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,500
- ( Marcosias chuckles )
- LETTING US TELL YOU

448
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,250
WHAT WE WANTED,
WHEN WE WANTED.

449
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:04,083
- ( chuckles )
OW!

450
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:07,916
- WELL, LOOKS LIKE
MY WORK HERE IS DONE.

451
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:12,000
I'LL BRING KEISAKU
HIS PAYOFF

452
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,833
FOR HIS LITTLE PART
IN ALL THIS.

453
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:16,250
- ( door opens, closes )

454
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,833
- WILHELMINA,
SHANA WORKED REALLY
HARD ON THIS MEAL. 

455
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,833
SHE EVEN GOT KAZUMI
TO TRAIN HER AND EVERYTHING.

456
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:25,583
- YEP.  ALL I DID
WAS PICK THE INGREDIENTS.

457
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,458
OH, AND STOOD BY TO MAKE SURE
NOTHING CAUGHT ON FIRE.

458
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,208
RIGHT, SHANA?

459
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:33,083
- UH-HUH.
( giggles )

460
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:39,041
- COOL.  I'LL BE IN CHARGE
OF TAKING TANAKA HIS SHARE
OF THE FOOD.

461
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,750
- AND I'LL BRING IKE HIS.

462
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,458
- OF COURSE.

463
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:44,708
I KNEW THOSE GUYS
WERE IN ON IT.

464
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:46,875
- SORRY, SAKAI.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO TOO.

465
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:49,916
- WAIT, WHAT?

466
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,041
- HERE, SAKAI.
THANK YOUR MOM AGAIN
FOR ALL HER HELP.

467
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,875
- OH.
- ( chuckles )

468
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:57,458
- SO, WILHELMINA,

469
00:24:57,541 --> 00:24:59,583
WHAT YOU TOLD ME EARLIER
ABOUT SCHOOL?

470
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:03,291
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

471
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:04,708

AROUND MY NECK
THROUGH ALL THIS.

YET YOU FIND IT
PERFECTLY FINE 

481
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:36,000
TO SIMPLY
SEND HIM ON HIS WAY?

- Alastor: IT IS FINE.

483
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:40,916

- Alastor:
WE CAME TO AN AGREEMENT.

489
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:55,958
IN ORDER TO REMAIN VIGILANT
AGAINST FUTURE CRISES,

490
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:58,708
WE NEED TO WORK TO ESTABLISH
A MODICUM OF TRUST

AFTER SPENDING
TIME WITH HIM,

493
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:05,166
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF YUJI SAKAI?
