by the violent,
underhanded Sabeltigers.

8

However, the heroic Ikki
choked back his anger

9
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,165
and decided to face
the bastardly villains

Anyway, the good news is the
Sabeltigers are F‐Class too.

24
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,364
Welcome to the Parts War.

25
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:38,617
This is the beginning of your
long climb up the Trophaeum.

26
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,035
But before you get started,

27
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,912
it's important to
understand the basics

28
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,455
of the Parts War system.

29
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,624
All Riders who
participate in Parts Wars

30
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:49,086
are divided into ranks
ranging from F‐Class to A‐Class.

31
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,129
Each class has their
own method of battle

32
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,882
specially catered
to their skill level.

33
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,343
Usually, areas or
parts of equal value

34
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,969
are wagered for one another.

35
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,347
In instances when teams
have no spare parts

36
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,307
and nothing else
to put on the line,

37
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,392
an emblem is bet.

38
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,477
Emblem bets are also
common among teams

39
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,521
with intense rivalries.

40
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,606
If the opponents
are in the same class,

41
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,525
they must win three
consecutive battles

42
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,735
in order to advance
to the next class.

43
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,988
However, if a lower ranked team
beats a higher ranked team,

44
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:20,075
then they will immediately
advance to the next class.

496
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,803
I made my own AT team.

497
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,055
Cool, huh?

498
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,515
We just made our debut but
we scored a big win already.

499
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,892
No, don't tell her that.

500
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,352
If Rika finds out
about the team,

501
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,562
she'll never let you
ride your ATs again.

502
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,563
What, but why?

503
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,439
You guys are all members

504
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,690
of the Sleeping Forest, right?

505
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,068
That's true, but you're
not one of the Noyamanos.

506
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:06,153
Next time on Air Gear,
to hell with all this

507
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,613
Wings of Icarus stuff.

508
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:10,074
I'll show you what
I'm made of, Rika,

509
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,742
that I will.

510
