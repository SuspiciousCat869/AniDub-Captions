what we'll be.

505
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,992
In the end, I guess
it's all up to Mr. Crow.

So long!

Next time we'll
meet in the sky.

Ikki, did you steal
our emblem and pick

511
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,388
a fight with the
Skull Saders again?

512
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,265
No, they challenged
me this time.

513
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,975
But if they want
another beating that bad,

514
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,769
I'll be more than
happy to serve it up.

Wait, something isn't right.

00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,397
What if someone planned this
whole thing behind your back?

Don't worry!

518

I can handle
these guys alone.

Kazu, Onigiri, Buccha,

520
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,403
you guys can be my
cheerleaders, okay?

Next time on Air Gear,

Magaki, it's a showdown.

523
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,575
I'll take you down for good!
