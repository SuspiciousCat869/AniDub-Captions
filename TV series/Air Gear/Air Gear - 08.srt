It looked super hard.

second year high school level.

The two rooms are just
divided by a partition,

so time can move again.

Huh, but why do you need us?

325
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,371
Can't you do it yourself?

326
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,374
Wait, so you mean it's not
just there for decoration?

327
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:30,625
It really is broken?

328
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,876
That's what I was wondering.

329
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,169
If it was broken,
it seems like

330
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,754
they would've fixed
it by now, right?

331
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,881
You see that little
door way up there?

332
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,716
That's the only
way to get inside.

333

That's dumb.

334
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,844
The AV room is right
next to the clock.

335
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,222
You should be able to get
in there, shouldn't you?

336

That's right,

337

the controls from there.

338

by a really thick wall.

340

Were the architects
drunk or something?

341

Yeah, stupid drunk architects.

342

It's supposedly
maintenance‐free.

343
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,779
It sets itself by some
kind of time signal,

344
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,198
so there shouldn't ever
be a need to go up there.

345
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,200
Oh, like the clock
on a computer, huh?

346

they use like radio waves.

Guys, it doesn't
really matter, does it?

a student at this school.

349

scatterbrained and clumsy.

just like you guys.

late for school every day,

352
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,760

always chewing me out.

back when I was in your grade.

No, look, he's
missing his stubble.

360

I can see his uvula.
