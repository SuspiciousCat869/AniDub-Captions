Hey, wait, you're right!

502
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,193
I forgot the
most important part.

503
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,654
You mean you haven't come up
with a name for your team yet?

504
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,072
Not exactly.

505
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,365
Next time on Air Gear,

506
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,659
the end of the Gunz and the
beginning of a new legend.

507
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,577
You can bet your emblem on it.
