but back when
I was racing

355
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,788
we didn't even
have Parts Wars.

366

My dad's really
old fashioned,

367
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,648

368

always spoutin' off nonsense,

369

And just when I thought
I couldn't take no more...

375
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,248
I put on a pair of ATs

376
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,416
and suddenly,

377
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,501
for the first
time in my life,

378
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:04,088
I felt like‐‐like
I had wings on my feet.

379
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,298
I could fly.

380

Rise above my problems.

I never knew there
was a world like that.

382

A world where I could
finally be free.

383
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,098
I hear you, brother.

384
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,349
I went through
the same thing myself

385
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,517
not too long ago.

386
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,936
And if I use my
allowance on parts,

387
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,563
my dad will find
out I'm racing.

388
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,190
That's why I'm looking

pretty guilty

402

if we took his
wheels from him.

403

Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing.

You know, it's funny,

looked at night.
