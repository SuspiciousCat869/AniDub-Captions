They live in the South America,

for shaking their ass

bedroom in the ground.

Once they sting their prey,

153
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,914
they drag 'em
into their tunnels

154
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,249
and start rockin' and rollin'.

155
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,583
Then when their
prey gets worked up

156
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,002
into a nice little
meatball, they eat him!

Rock uses the same concept
