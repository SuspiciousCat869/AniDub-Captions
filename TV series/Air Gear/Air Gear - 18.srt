166
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:38,244

take a whiff, it's over!

What's going on?

169
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,877
I feel like he can
see right through me.

170
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:49,756
Even if I try to cover up,
it's like he can see everything.

171
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,716
There's nothing
to be ashamed of.

172
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,219
After all, everyone
is born naked.

173
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,303
You should be
proud of your body.

174
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,388
‐But I‐‐
‐While it may be true

175
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,724
that you have tainted
that beautiful body of yours

176
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,975
in many ways,

177
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:04,729
that does not mean you
should ever be ashamed of it,

178
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,315
because each and
every one of those marks

179
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,526
is a sign on the
road of your life.

180
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,112
Even with its flaws,
that body of yours

181
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,406
is living proof of who you are.

182
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,118
Don't act like you know me.

183
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,994
The real you is hurting.

184
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,705
It does not want
to battle like this.

185
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,957
Set it free!

186
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:28,044
Open your arms and release
your true self from its cage!

187
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,295
I was a fool.

188
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,757
All this time, I've been
pretending that I had fangs,

189
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,260
but that's not
the real me at all.

190
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,137
Now I see the truth.

191
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,848
Now I realize what I've
truly been searching for

192
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,683

I don't know what

but I guess the
fight's over now.

200
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,454
That's one point
for Kogarasumaru!

201
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,290
Now do you get it?

202

Even Onigiri was pushing himself

Mitsuru's punches may be strong,

Rock, Paper, Scissors?

00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,297
I'm surprised‐‐
it's not like you

sorts of compliments,

but it's a pretty clever plan.

240
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,220
You see, the muscles
here in your wrist

241
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,596
determine the
strength of your punch,

242
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,140
but too much and your
gripping reflex slows down.

243
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,142
That's why Mitsuru's
been losing so much.

244
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,729
Pay close attention
to Ikki's hand.

245

He changed his move!

246

That's how he does it.

247

But there's one thing
I can't figure out.

248
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,697
He should be able
to win every time,

249
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,865

he's been losing on purpose

00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,704
That was close‐‐I've
gotta be more careful!

252
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,498
This room's only
a few feet wide,

253
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,793
