Is that some kind of trick

503
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,055
or are there
really eight of you?

504
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,598
Those guys win their battles

505
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,558
by sacrificing
their teammates.

506
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,186
But you have a
better plan, right?

507
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,687
‐Ikki!
‐Of course.

508
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,231
I'll just jump off of Kazu's
head and win the match.

509
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,858
He can't swim, but
I'm sure his body

510
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:03,984
will wash up somewhere.

511
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:04,818
Are you nuts?

512
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,320
How is that better?

513
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,655
Next time on <i>Air Gear,</i>

514
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:10,449
a war of sacrifice,
rivals in battle.

515
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,576
And rivals in love.

516
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,036
Huh?

517
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,204
Shit.
