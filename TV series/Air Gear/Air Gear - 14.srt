Hey wait, your money!

164
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:31,803
I promise I'll pay you back
next time I see you, okay?

165
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,179
I think the
reason I said that

166
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,347
was to convince myself

167
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,057
that we'd see
each other again.

168
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,687
I warned you, didn't I?

169
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,272
Roses have thorns, you know.

170
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,481
If you don't
watch yourself,

171
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,901
you might just
end up getting pricked.

172
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,737
(clapping)

173
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,072
Wow, bravo, good show.

174
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,157
You don't disappoint.

175
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,909
I was wondering when
I'd see you again.

176
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,494
Here, I've got your cash.

177
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,496
Cash, why do
I need cash?

178
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,790
For the soda you
gave me, of course.

179
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,959
That's funny, I just
had it right here,

180
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,294
where'd it go?

181
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,421
(chuckling)

182
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:09,215
My name's Sora,
it means sky.

183
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,343
Big open kind
with lots of clouds.

184
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,679
That's a pretty flashy
name for a guy like you.

185
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,805
But now that
you mention it,

186
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,182
that flighty
attitude of yours

187
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,060
does kind of
remind me of a cloud.

188
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,896
Wow, so you've been
carrying that money around

189
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,397
ever since we met?

190
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:29,736
I‐‐I just don't like being
in anyone's debt, okay?

191
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,780
Really, it's just a soda.

192
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,989
Anyway, is there
a reason why

193
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,450
you're always riding
alone like that?

194
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,035
Wha‐‐what do you mean?

195
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,536
Usually people
who are into ATs

196
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,289
belong to some kind of
team or something, right?

197
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,540
You don't get
to have much fun

198
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,541
if you ride alone.

199
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,709
That's what it's come down to

200
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,045
since they started
this Parts War.

201
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,088
You're right.

202
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,672
You know,
I used to ride my ATs

203
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,673
to have a good time.

204
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,717
But now it seems
like everywhere I go,

205
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,677
someone is always trying
to pick a fight with me.

206
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,971
That's too bad‐‐
well, see you next time,

207
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:57,889
whenever that is.

208
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,349
‐Later.
‐Hey, hold on!

209
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,768
I haven't paid you yet!

210
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,895
From then on, I started
running into Sora

211
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,939
at more and more AT battles.

212
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:06,731
I guess I was too busy

213
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,274
with my own
fights to notice,

214
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,984
but I never
saw him get involved

215
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,986
in a Parts War.

216
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,030
Good evening,
your majesty.

217
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,031
Getting bored
now that you've

218
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,950
conquered all
the teams around here?

219
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,369
Actually, I head some team
called Sleeping something

Really?

222
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,415
It's no ordinary
team, either,

223
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,792
there's some really
tough Storm Riders

224
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,753
that got together and totally
dominated the Parts Wars.

225
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,214
They're even calling
themselves kings.

226

Heard of 'em?

I think I heard
about it somewhere.

I'm trying to remember
the name of the guy

is something like Takeuchi.

going easy on you.

489
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,466
Back in my day,
you'd be lying

490
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:02,470
in a puddle of
your own blood by now.

491
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,640
You're wasting my time.

492
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,851
I don't believe it.

493
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,436
I'm telling you,
that girl's as hot

494
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,354
as the day I met her.

495
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,065
Take a look at that ass.

496
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:18,819
Is that a fine
piece of work or what?

497
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,820
Huh?

498
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,405
Ugh, come on, man.

499
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,490
Don't you know
it's bad form

500
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,784
to tell someone
his sister's ass is hot?

501
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,035
'Cause if I say
no then I'm lying

502
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,329
and if I say yes,
then I'm just a perv.

503
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,914
That's not the point,
all right?

504
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,082
Listen, normally
when you're riding ATs,

505
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,710
you use your knee joints
as the core of your movement.

506
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,213
But for the Queen of Thorns,
the core is higher.

507
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,964
Her attacks have
a wider range of motion

508
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,549
because they
originate from her hips

509
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,926
instead of her knees.

510
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,720
Ergo, nice ass.

511
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,639
(bell ringing)

512
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,224
That technique
of hers blocks your path

513
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,142
like a wall of thorns.

514
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,061
If you ain't the real Sky King,

515
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,396
there's no way you're
gonna make it through.

516
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,731
Got it!

517
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,274
I can do this!

518
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,527
I'm not gonna
give up my ATs!

519
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:00,486
Uh?

520
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,989

No matter what,

525
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,392
The Sonia Road pushes a rider
to their absolute limit.

526
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,477
If Rika keeps this up,

00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,896
she's gonna tear
her legs to pieces.

528

Don't worry,
I'll chop down

her wall of thorns
in no time.

I know Rika's doing
this to protect Ikki,

but I don't know who
to believe in anymore.

Next time on Air Gear,

533
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,031
I'll break free
from this cage

534
