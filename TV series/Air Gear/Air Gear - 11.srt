496

This guy's a joke.

497
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,105
What, are they
psychic or something?

498
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,315
It's just a read.

499
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,442
They're little cell phone
programs that analyze

500
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,652
the data stored inside
the heel of your AT.

501
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,654
So they know how
much Kazu sucks?

502
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,156
No way, that's not fair!

503
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:24,533
Hey, hey, they're using
pretty decent parts.

504
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,578
This might be a good
battle after all.

505
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:28,996
All right, here's the deal.

506
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,915
We'll challenge
you to a Parts War.

507
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,417
If you win, you take
the area, but if we win,

508
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,045
you leave all of your equipment
here and go home naked.

509
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,214
Hmm.

510
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,757
Does that mean the girls
have to strip too?

511
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:40,841
If we're lucky.

512
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,511
In your dreams, boys.

So, are you up
for it or not?

518
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,731
We can totally school
these jerks in a fight.

519

We don't have to
play their game.

Kazu just slid off the track
