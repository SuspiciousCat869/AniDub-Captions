Hey, Ringo, what's up with
our school's clock tower?

499
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:51,847
It's always stuck at 8:29.

00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,848
Why don't they fix it?

00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,850
I'm not sure, but I
heard it has to do

00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,685
with Miss Tomita
and Mr. Orihara.

she was in middle school.
