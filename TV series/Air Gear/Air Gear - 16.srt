this clever little

Akira Udo and the
Four Holy Beasts

212
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,800
are the strongest
riders in D‐Class,

213
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,845
but riders with their skills
are good enough to be A‐Class,

214
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,430
they just abuse the system

215
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,182
to keep themselves
from advancing.

216
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,350
As long as they make sure

217
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,227
they don't win three
battles in a row,

218
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:11,064
they stay in D‐Class and
dominate the low‐level teams.

219
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,650
It'd be suicide even
for me to challenge them

220
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,776
on their home turf.

221
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:18,154
That's why I baited them
with all of our stickers.

222
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,989
Now that you mention
it, they were the ones

223
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,366
who initiated the battle!

224
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,618
But no matter what area
you decide to fight in,

225
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,995
you still have the disadvantage.

226
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,665
Think of Kogarasumaru's
debut battle!

227
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,542
The way I see it, it
should work out quite nicely!

228
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,962
Our team looks weak,
but we have three riders

229
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,881
whose speed completely
transcends F‐Class‐‐

230
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,593
the wuss, the freak in
the mask, and of course, me.

231
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:44,055
Strongest D‐Class
versus strongest F.

232
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,557
And since the dash
is a contest of speed,

233
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,851
this battle oughta be a
real kick in the pants.

234
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,938
‐You can count me out.
‐Ikki?

235

I've never seen that kind of
power before‐‐there's no way.

236
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,944
You can't expect me to race
against a monster like that.

means close combat.

One, they disrespected me,

two, they treated me
like I was nothing,
