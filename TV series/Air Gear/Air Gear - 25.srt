I hate to see it end this way,

332
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,765
but it looks to me
like this is it.

333
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,934
All according to your plan, huh?

334
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,644
You've seen the Rumble Regalia.

335
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,480
That's what you wanted, right?

336
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,066
You can be as
ambitious as you'd like.

337
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,943
I don't care.

338
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,528
But I tell you one thing:

339
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,988
If you keep thinking like that,

340
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,825
you'll never be a king
for as long as you ride.

341
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,619
Not bad, you're almost there.

342
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,579
Why not move out of the way?

343
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,788
I don't understand.

344
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,124
How can he keep this up
with an injured knee?

345
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,459
I guess that's the difference

346
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,794
between a guy who's
destined to be king

347
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,129
and you.

348
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,048
While you're sitting
here on the ground

349
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,341
picking things apart

350
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,468
and thinking about how you
can take advantage of people,

351
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:53,888
he's only thinking
about one thing:

352
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,556
the sky.

353
00:16:55,556 --> 00:17:01,354
♪

354
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,772
Even all the way up here,

355
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:06,275
I still can't find
my mommy and daddy.

356
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,360
But when I look down,

357
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,320
I feel like I could
walk on the clouds

358
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,282
and keep walking,
forever and ever.

359
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,408
‐Huh?
‐Gotcha!

360
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,409
Take us up!

361
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,369
Riko, we gotta stop him.

362
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,330
Yeah, I'm worried
about his knee!

363
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,498
(scream)

364
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:21,832
It's too late now.

365
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,793
He already has his wings.

366
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:24,794
Huh?

367
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,003
Ever since he was young,

368
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,464
I've always been afraid
of him realizing that

369
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,841
and flying away.

370
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:34,011
But now, I can't
deny it anymore.

371
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,682
And no matter how much
we sit and worry about him...

372
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:41,852
those wings will always
call him back to the sky.

373
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,689
I thought the battle
would have ended by now.

374
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:45,898
Glad we made it.

375
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,858
I wanna see my little Crow fly.

376
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,193
But if Ikki loses,

377
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,195
he won't just bring
shame to Genesis.

378
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,031
He'll make everyone
in Kanto look bad.

379
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,117
And believe me,
that wouldn't be good.

380
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,493
Come on.

381
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,996
Do you really think
that'll happen?

382
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,497
All right!

383
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:05,376
The density of wind is
much higher than still air.

384
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,128
If he can ride its
pressure gradient,

385
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:10,381
he can lift his body
up even higher.

386
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,676
Normal people can't detect
something as subtle as that,

387
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,219
but this kid is different,

388
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,389
he feels it with
every inch of his skin.

389
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:21,892
It's easy to call it talent,
but it's more than that.

390
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,769
How should I say it, it's like

391
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:28,065
he's finally discovered
his true wings.

392
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,567
Kazu, move your ass!

393
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,695
‐Way ahead of you.
‐Ditto.

394
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,572
You finally made it
down here, huh?

395
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,032
'Bout damn time.

396
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,742
(chuckles)

397
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:38,826
Almost.

398
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,788
He's changed.

399
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,874
You're saying he's
qualified to be king

400
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:48,210
because of that winged
shadow behind him?

401
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,211
Are you kidding?

402
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,005
You still don't get it, do you?

403
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,257
Aeon, do you know
why ATs are different

404
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,135
from skateboards
and things like that?

405
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,347
Because with ATs,
you can fly.

406
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,474
But although we follow
different roads,

407
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,975
we all ride the wind,

408
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,478
because we all
share the same sky.

409
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,606
We call it the
Infinite Atmosphere,

410
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,150
the power that allows us to fly.

411
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,027
Every regalia
and every technique

412
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,404
relies on the wind in some way.

413
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,032
Of course, that goes
for my Rumble Reglia

414
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,617
and his Fang Regalia,

415
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:24,205
as well as Spitfire's Flame
Regalia and Nue's Thunder.

416
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:27,249
Actually, the number of kings
isn't limited to eight.

417
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,085
It's just that there have
only been eight roads

418
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,546
with the power to find
the true path to the sky.

419
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,800
So it's no surprise
that Simca wants Ikki.

420
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,511
Since the Wing Road calls
on the power of the wind,

421
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,596
it's central to all
the different roads

422
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,640
leading to the top.

423
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,266
(crowd cheering)

424
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,144
Is this one of your
strategies you're so proud of?

425
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,772
You're hoping that
Ikki's power will awaken,

426
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:53,317
and then he'll challenge Genesis
just like he said he would.

427
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,487
And after the battle,
both teams will be weakened,

428
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,240
with Trident remaining
untouched, of course.

429
