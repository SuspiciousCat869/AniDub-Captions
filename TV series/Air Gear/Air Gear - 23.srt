If you wanna go to the top,
you gotta think ahead.

the middle of the city!

Oh man, this is bad, without
our ATs we're really screwed!

you're dealing with here?

need to learn some manners!

with Team Trident!

179

hold out much longer.

Let's split up
and get outta here.

181
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:23,433
There's no way, we can't outrun
Storm Riders without our ATs!

responsible for this?

Oh, so you have 'em wired, huh?

188
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,622
Well, looks like you
caught me red handed,

189

me for trying.

about you becoming
the leader of Genesis.

I'm surprised you
weren't expecting

223
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,153
something like this to happen.

224
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,612
Don't get me wrong though.

225
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,115
I'm not trying to excuse
what those punks did.

226
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,451
You're still our guest,
and if we send you home

227
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,037
in a body bag then that
reflects poorly on us.

228
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,456
Well, that's what the
boss would say at least.

229
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,083
Then I have a message for you
to take back to your boss.

230
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,626
If he doesn't want
his dogs to bite,

231
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,378
he should learn to
keep them on leashes.

232
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,465
If that's how you feel maybe you
should follow your own advice.

233
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,009
If you're serious about
becoming the leader of Genesis,

234
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,512
then before you know it, all
of Japan will be your backyard.

235
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,140
But if you can't even deal
with the dogs in Kansai,

236
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,600
how will you handle the rest?

237
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,353
You need to step up and
show them who's in charge.

238
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,022
There's something
else you should know.

239
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,067
When it comes to our boss,
no matter what road you ride,

240
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:22,612
none of you stand a chance in
hell of defeating him in battle.

241
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,989
You may be proud of
that wind of yours,

242
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,325
but once it faces
our boss's power,

243
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,286
it's no different than feeding
a breeze through a turbine.

244
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,164
It's the windmill theory, I
know that might not make sense

245
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:37,001
to you now, but you'll
understand soon enough.

See ya.

247
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,632
I knew there was something
fishy about that woman

I laid eyes on her.

Good morning everyone, I hope
you're enjoying the trip so far,

wanna end up like these punks,

254
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,448
then you better not cause
any trouble, get it?

All right, now eat
your breakfast!

Were they up all night fighting?

They came back with
a lot of bruises.

Oh, come on, don't
be such a prude.

261

We're going to
Uzamasa Movie Land!

‐Just the two of us, huh?

264
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,431
Now that I think about it,
even though Ikki and I live

265
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,684
in the same house,
it's been a long time

266
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,728
since we've gotten to spend
time alone with each other.

it's time to go!

Let's enjoy the tour, okay?

by windmill theory?
