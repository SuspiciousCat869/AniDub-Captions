We've actually been putting
together a crew in Kamata.

it from your side.

[CROW] The truth is,
we've been worried.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.874 position:50% align:center
Our calls weren't going through.

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.502 position:50% align:center
And the fruit stand was a
wreck when we stopped by.

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:24.462 position:50% align:center

So, Hiroto thought we'd hang out

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:26.256 position:50% align:center

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:29.009 position:50% align:center

you in the middle of it.

[HIROTO]
What can I say?

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.179 position:50% align:center
Guess I've started
using my head a little.

00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:36.725 position:50% align:center
Listen, there's something kinda
serious that I need to tell you.

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:39.227 position:50% align:center

Shadow after you.

--Oh, I know.

And I'm gonna settle
that score someday.

But first things first.

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:47.819 position:50% align:center
We need to put an end
to current madness.

Mm.

There's no time left
to look for Mitsuki,

00:08:56.953 --> 00:09:00.457 position:50% align:center

gearing up the G-Boys as well.

both sides to go down.

beat 'em for sure.

so yourself, didn't you?

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:33.073 position:50% align:center
We don't have much of a choice.

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:36.117 position:50% align:center
The other side has the full
support of the Hidaka Group.

00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:38.119 position:50% align:center
We might as well suit up.

Isogai's got a good point there.

protect your family?

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:45.960 position:50% align:center

No, we're good.

I'll hit you up once we
hash out the details.

You sure?

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:16.282 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] By the way,
can I borrow a cellphone.

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:18.785 position:50% align:center
I accidentally dropped
mine and it broke.

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:21.788 position:50% align:center
And using pay phones
is kind of a drag.

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:23.248 position:50% align:center
I've got it covered.

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:25.750 position:50% align:center
Just let me know where I
can drop it off for you.

meet the King, exactly?

Why do you want to know?

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:47.856 position:50% align:center
If it's cool,
I'd like to be there.

You aren't the only
guy who wants

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:52.110 position:50% align:center
to try and prevent
a giant bloodbath.

00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:53.611 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:56.948 position:50% align:center
Or maybe... you're trying
to get the jump on us again.

00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:58.116 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:00.160 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Zero-One showed
me how this works.

A few simple swipes to find the
planted malware, and bingo.

the entire time.

00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:27.228 position:50% align:center
[TOMOMI] I had a feeling
this would happen.

00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:30.023 position:50% align:center
Too bad. I'm three
steps ahead of you.

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:32.525 position:50% align:center
So, tell me, what tipped
you off, then?

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
I knew it had to have been
somebody close to me.

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:37.614 position:50% align:center
Someone who could
anticipate my every step.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:40.075 position:50% align:center
Or hack my phone
without me knowing it.

Aren't you smart?

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:43.787 position:50% align:center
I did spend quality
time with you,

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.581 position:50% align:center
so I had quite a few chances.

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:49.668 position:50% align:center
Are you the one who made
Mitsuki shoot Takashi?

00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:51.711 position:50% align:center
Did you kill Watanabe?

00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:53.755 position:50% align:center
Oh, I assumed that you'd
let your guard down

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:55.548 position:50% align:center
around the helpless four-eyes.

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:59.386 position:50% align:center
And as for Watanabe, he did
manage to suss me out somehow,

00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:02.722 position:50% align:center
so I took care of him before he
had a chance to snitch on me.

You were a liability.

Which is why I was
told to kill you, too.

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:10.855 position:50% align:center
Remember that
little hit and run?

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:13.650 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I really didn't
have the heart to do it.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:16.152 position:50% align:center
I mean, you've been
nothing but good to me.

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:19.489 position:50% align:center
And anyway...

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:23.576 position:50% align:center
You're worth a lot more to me
than Takashi or even Kyouichi.

a grudge or something?

he did manage to suss
me out somehow,
