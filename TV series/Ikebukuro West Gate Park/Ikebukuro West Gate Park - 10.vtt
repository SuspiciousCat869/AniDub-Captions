00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.014 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Crime and punishment.

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:16.349 position:50% align:center
The balance between
them is always shifting.

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:20.729 position:50% align:center
When it comes to the sentence
for any given crime,

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:22.814 position:50% align:center
some people will say it's fair.

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:25.025 position:50% align:center
While others will say
it's too forgiving.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:30.071 position:50% align:center
Today's story is about
figuring out that balance.

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.117 position:50% align:center
Excuse me.
Sorry to bother you.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.952 position:50% align:center
Oh, how can I help you?

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.079 position:50% align:center
You're Makoto Majima, right?

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:39.539 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Yeah, that's me--

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.127 position:50% align:center
Uh, okay?

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.296 position:50% align:center
I would like you to
smash his knee in.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.589 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:49.466 position:50% align:center
Either one will work for me.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:50.967 position:50% align:center
Go hard.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:53.720 position:50% align:center
I want him to hobble on a
cane for the rest of his life.

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:55.138 position:50% align:center
Let's walk and talk.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:56.222 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Hold on!

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:33.528 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
You never gave me your name.

00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:35.030 position:50% align:center
Chihiro Hayama.

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:37.657 position:50% align:center
I work at a shop in the area.

00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:39.909 position:50% align:center
Mind telling me
where we're headed?

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.244 position:50% align:center
[CHIHIRO]
To the crime scene.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:42.912 position:50% align:center
I want you to see
it for yourself.

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:46.041 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.
Can you tell me what happened?

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:47.792 position:50% align:center
It was exactly a year ago,

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:49.627 position:50% align:center
when my brother was
working at this Italian place

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:51.838 position:50% align:center
near the West Gate.

00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:55.008 position:50% align:center
It happened a little after
11 during his walk home.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.010 position:50% align:center

[TSUKASA yelling]

00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:12.609 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Somebody! Help me, please!

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:17.489 position:50% align:center
[CHIHIRO] This is the alley
where everything happened

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:18.740 position:50% align:center
that night.

00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:21.117 position:50% align:center
That gutter punk left my
brother's knee shattered

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:22.702 position:50% align:center
beyond repair.

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:25.955 position:50% align:center
He wasn't even carrying
that much money on him.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:29.000 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Well, did they
ever find the culprit?

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:30.502 position:50% align:center
[CHIHIRO]
He went to jail.

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:31.753 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
That's good, right?

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:33.713 position:50% align:center
It isn't good at all!

00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:35.840 position:50% align:center
They only tried him as a minor.

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:39.135 position:50% align:center
He served an easy
sentence of seven months.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.013 position:50% align:center
Now he's free to
live a normal life.

00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:45.558 position:50% align:center
My poor brother can barely
walk without assistance,

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:48.645 position:50% align:center
but that jerk gets to live his
life like nothing happened.

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.022 position:50% align:center
Ever since the attack my
brother can't stay on his feet

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:54.275 position:50% align:center
for long periods of time, which
means he can't cook anymore.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.653 position:50% align:center
So, he had to quit his job!

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:59.072 position:50% align:center
All over 3,000 yen.

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:00.490 position:50% align:center
That guy's a monster!

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:03.660 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Gotcha.

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:05.245 position:50% align:center
Why don't you give
me the details?

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.082 position:50% align:center
So, what's his name?

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:10.417 position:50% align:center
[CHIHIRO]
Eiji Otokawa.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.460 position:50% align:center
And why did you come
to me, exactly?

00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:15.296 position:50% align:center
Honestly, 'cause I
heard you were cheap.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.091 position:50% align:center
It's a good thing that I'm the
first person that you talked to.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.762 position:50% align:center
The thing is, nowadays,
there are tons of hustlers

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:26.975 position:50% align:center
out there who'll do anything
to make some quick dough.

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:28.268 position:50% align:center
It's risky.

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:30.020 position:50% align:center
If you ask the wrong
scumbag, you might end up

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.980 position:50% align:center
running into more trouble.

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:33.440 position:50% align:center
It's a common practice.

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:35.316 position:50% align:center
After the job is done,
they'll make threats

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.193 position:50% align:center
and extort you for extra cash.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.739 position:50% align:center
In any case, you should
go ahead and tell me

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:43.700 position:50% align:center
everything you know
about this Eiji Otokawa.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:45.577 position:50% align:center
He was doing time at
a correctional facility

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.079 position:50% align:center
in Nagano till last year.

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:50.290 position:50% align:center
Since he got out, he's been
drifting around and living

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:51.416 position:50% align:center
at home.

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:55.003 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Hey.

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.213 position:50% align:center
Are you absolutely sure
you wanna hurt this guy?

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:58.506 position:50% align:center
[CHIHIRO]
Of course!

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.091 position:50% align:center
I just want you to be sure.

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:01.593 position:50% align:center
Because once you
go through with this,

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:03.678 position:50% align:center
you'll have stooped
down to his level.

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:04.846 position:50% align:center
Think about it.

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
[CHIHIRO]
I don't care.

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:15.732 position:50% align:center
I want that monster to
suffer the same way

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:17.067 position:50% align:center
my brother did.

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:23.281 position:50% align:center
I need you to mess him up
beyond repair, you got it?

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:48.473 position:50% align:center
Hey, Chihiro! Where are you?

00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:50.225 position:50% align:center
[CHIHIRO]
The Rosa Kaikan arcade.

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:51.559 position:50% align:center
He comes here a lot.

00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:53.937 position:50% align:center
Don't make any
moves till I'm there.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.313 position:50% align:center
You'll only tip him off!

00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:57.482 position:50% align:center
[CHIHIRO]
Relax, I'm wearing sunglasses.

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:59.275 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Like that's a flawless disguise.

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:04.197 position:50% align:center
Yo, Big Rei, it's Makoto.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.117 position:50% align:center
You got a sec? I need some info!

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.828 position:50% align:center
That mean you can't go out
for a drink today? Lame.

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:11.538 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Look, not right now, Rei!

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:12.997 position:50% align:center
I'm in a bit of a hurry!

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:16.543 position:50% align:center
Name's Eiji Otokawa.

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:18.712 position:50% align:center
He just got released from juvie.

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:21.214 position:50% align:center
Could you look the kid up
and get back to me? Quick?

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:22.424 position:50% align:center
[REIICHIROU]
Got it.

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:25.343 position:50% align:center
Figures.

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.229 position:50% align:center
[CHIHIRO]
That's him right there.

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:39.190 position:50% align:center
Looks kinda timid for
a so-called monster.

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:41.526 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzing]

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:45.613 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Hello? Okay. One sec.

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:50.994 position:50% align:center
Whatcha got?

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:53.204 position:50% align:center
[REIICHIROU] Eiji Otokawa,
age 18 and unemployed.

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:55.081 position:50% align:center
[CHIHIRO gasps]

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:56.416 position:50% align:center
[REIICHIROU] He assaulted
restaurant worker

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:59.669 position:50% align:center
Tsukasa Hayama,
dealing a blow to the shoulder.

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:01.838 position:50% align:center
The weapon was cylindrical.

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.840 position:50% align:center
He then stomped
on the victim's leg,

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:06.217 position:50% align:center
crushing it at the knee.

00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:07.802 position:50% align:center
Hold on a minute.

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:11.264 position:50% align:center
Was he packing one of those
extendable police batons?

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:12.766 position:50% align:center
No, he wasn't.

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:14.768 position:50% align:center
He had a stainless
steel shoehorn,

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:16.478 position:50% align:center
and was only about
a foot in length.

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:17.520 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
That's it?

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:19.022 position:50% align:center
That's it.

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:21.107 position:50% align:center
I bet he was desperate and
grabbed whatever he could find

00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:23.026 position:50% align:center
at home.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.986 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
What do you mean, "desperate"?

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.613 position:50% align:center
[REIICHIROU]
Apparently,

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:29.032 position:50% align:center
a group of his classmates
had started bullying him

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:30.325 position:50% align:center
for money.

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:32.202 position:50% align:center
The deadline for coughing
up payment was one day

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:33.620 position:50% align:center
after the attack.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.499 position:50% align:center
He testified that if
he hadn't done it,

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:39.459 position:50% align:center
he would've been
the one to get hit.

00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:48.301 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Did the other
students get in trouble?

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:52.138 position:50% align:center
[REIICHIROU]
Yeah. Four boys, A, B, C, and D.

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:55.058 position:50% align:center
Although, because these were
only their first offenses,

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.935 position:50% align:center
they got off with
warnings instead.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.605 position:50% align:center
They were basically acquitted.

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:01.856 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Man.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.359 position:50% align:center
So the one who got
bullied was sent to jail?

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:06.111 position:50% align:center
[REIICHIROU] Listen, you know
what I'm about to say,

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:07.278 position:50% align:center
but this call--

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:08.113 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Never happened.

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:09.781 position:50% align:center
Got it. Thanks.

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:17.664 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
There it is.

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:19.207 position:50% align:center
The reason he jumped
your brother was because

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
he had to save himself.

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:23.545 position:50% align:center
He got caught and paid
the price while the ones

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.463 position:50% align:center
who started this whole
debacle walked away

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:27.549 position:50% align:center
with a small slap on the wrist.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.926 position:50% align:center
[EIJI grunts]

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.678 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Guess he's not done paying up.

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:36.641 position:50% align:center
So, Chihiro, still bent on
getting even with the boy?

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:39.519 position:50% align:center
Got that, chump?

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:42.856 position:50% align:center
[PUNKS laugh]

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:45.233 position:50% align:center
I'm not too sure.

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:48.028 position:50% align:center
It's bleak, but I can't
just forgive him.

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:55.118 position:50% align:center
[CHIHIRO]
Oh. Wanna meet my brother?

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.161 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Sure.

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:57.912 position:50% align:center
I kinda know where you stand.

00:08:57.996 --> 00:09:00.749 position:50% align:center
But him? Not so much.

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:02.709 position:50% align:center
Besides, if it were me,

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:04.961 position:50% align:center
and I was kept in
the dark about this stuff,

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:07.297 position:50% align:center
it'd rub me the wrong way, too.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.798 position:50% align:center
[CHIHIRO]
Speaking of which,

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:11.634 position:50% align:center
he doesn't know that
guy's back in town.

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:13.762 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Let's keep it a secret for now.

00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:15.430 position:50% align:center
How 'bout we pretend
you're introducing

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:17.474 position:50% align:center
a new boyfriend?

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:18.558 position:50% align:center
[CHIHIRO]
All right.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.481 position:50% align:center
[doorbell rings]

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:25.565 position:50% align:center
[CHIHIRO]
Coming!

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:38.578 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That suit does
not work on you.

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:39.746 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Uh...

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:45.335 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Thanks for having me.

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:46.753 position:50% align:center
Nice place!

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:47.879 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
You're welcome.

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:53.259 position:50% align:center
Do your folks not
live with you guys?

00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:55.011 position:50% align:center
No, not anymore.

00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:57.180 position:50% align:center
They were in a car accident
and both passed away

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.099 position:50% align:center
when I was 11.

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:00.141 position:50% align:center
That's awful.

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:02.310 position:50% align:center
Sorry for bringing
the question up.

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:05.063 position:50% align:center
It's the whole reason why
my brother loves to cook.

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:06.648 position:50% align:center
He wanted to make
sure we always had

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:08.858 position:50% align:center
delicious food on the table.

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:10.902 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's all this
whispering about?

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:14.239 position:50% align:center
Here, Makoto, I've made plenty,
so don't hold back okay?

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:15.865 position:50% align:center
I really appreciate it.

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:32.132 position:50% align:center
Dude, I hope you know
you're a phenomenal chef.

00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:34.134 position:50% align:center
We used to dream of
starting a restaurant,

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:35.719 position:50% align:center
but not anymore.

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:38.263 position:50% align:center
Why? It's five-star grub.

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:40.974 position:50% align:center
When you have titanium
wires bracing your leg,

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:43.977 position:50% align:center
you can't stand up for
more than three hours.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.104 position:50% align:center
And that won't change.

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:47.605 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see.

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:54.195 position:50% align:center
Listen.

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:56.823 position:50% align:center
If you met your attacker,
what would you do?

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:01.369 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:04.164 position:50% align:center
At first, I fantasized about
stabbing him to death,

00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:07.042 position:50% align:center
and the thought of going to
prison didn't even faze me.

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:08.877 position:50% align:center
But, realistically speaking,

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.588 position:50% align:center
that would make things worse
without changing the situation.

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:17.802 position:50% align:center
If I could look him in the
eye and talk face to face.

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:20.430 position:50% align:center
Then perhaps I'd feel
differently about it.

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:21.514 position:50% align:center
How come?

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:27.395 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA] At the end of the day,
not all criminals are monsters.

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:29.105 position:50% align:center
I think once you get
to know someone

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:31.024 position:50% align:center
on a more human level,

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:35.320 position:50% align:center
your preconceived notions
are likely to change.

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:38.823 position:50% align:center
I don't want to live with
this pain and hatred forever.

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:40.909 position:50% align:center
I still resent him
for what he did,

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:42.786 position:50% align:center
but I'm willing to move on.

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:49.000 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Choosing to seek
understanding instead

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:50.835 position:50% align:center
of revenge.

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:52.170 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:54.714 position:50% align:center
So that's what it means
to take the high road.

00:11:54.798 --> 00:11:56.591 position:50% align:center
And carry yourself with dignity.

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:04.724 position:50% align:center
[CHIHIRO]
Oh! Welcome home.

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:14.776 position:50% align:center
[CHIHIRO]
What's wrong?

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:16.111 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
I saw him.

00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:20.699 position:50% align:center
I saw him.

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:23.910 position:50% align:center
Tsukasa?

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:33.920 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
I saw him.

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:40.093 position:50% align:center
Chihiro. I saw him.

00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:45.890 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
He spotted Otokawa?

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:46.891 position:50% align:center
[CHIHIRO]
Yeah.

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:48.518 position:50% align:center
He's mostly calmed down now,

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:50.311 position:50% align:center
but I've never
seen him like that.

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:52.439 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Crap, we're out of time.

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:53.982 position:50% align:center
Gotta act fast.

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:55.316 position:50% align:center
[CHIHIRO]
What'll you do?

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.568 position:50% align:center
I have a plan.

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:06.578 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Yo. You're Eiji, right?

00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:07.996 position:50% align:center
You can call me Makoto.

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:10.874 position:50% align:center
Been keeping an eye on you.

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:12.876 position:50% align:center
A certain someone
made a request.

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:17.005 position:50% align:center
Who were they? Tell me.

00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:21.217 position:50% align:center
I couldn't help but
notice your old friends

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:23.428 position:50% align:center
from high school harassing you.

00:13:23.511 --> 00:13:25.722 position:50% align:center
You trying to get those
losers off your back?

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.098 position:50% align:center
'Cause you can.

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:31.436 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Say the word
and I'll make a call.

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:33.688 position:50% align:center
You could join up
with the G-Boys.

00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:35.690 position:50% align:center
As soon as you
start wearing blue,

00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:38.610 position:50% align:center
every punk in town will
know to steer clear.

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:42.697 position:50% align:center
Wait a second, you talking
about the King's army?

00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:44.908 position:50% align:center
Before I give you
this bandana though.

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:47.911 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna want you to
meet with my client first.

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:50.580 position:50% align:center
If you object, I'll take
the deal off the table.

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:54.959 position:50% align:center
I'm a little lost here.

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:57.462 position:50% align:center
I'll hear them out,
whoever they are.

00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:59.089 position:50% align:center
I could use a favor.

00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:03.093 position:50% align:center
--[TAKASHI] I'm right here.
--[MAKOTO gasps]

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:07.263 position:50% align:center
As of late,
The Red Angels

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:09.974 position:50% align:center
have expanded their
sphere of influence.

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:12.435 position:50% align:center
And that means
more errands to do.

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:13.645 position:50% align:center
Dude, you know you
didn't have to make

00:14:13.728 --> 00:14:15.105 position:50% align:center
a personal appearance.

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:16.356 position:50% align:center
I was around the neighborhood,

00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:17.899 position:50% align:center
so I thought I would
check in and see how

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:20.026 position:50% align:center
you would resolve this mess.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.236 position:50% align:center
You're Otokawa, right?

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:23.196 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah!

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:26.241 position:50% align:center
Makoto filled me in
about your plight.

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:30.662 position:50% align:center
As of this moment, you are
now officially a G-Boy.

00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:33.832 position:50% align:center
If anyone ever threatens you,
mention my name.

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:36.459 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:14:43.842 --> 00:14:46.678 position:50% align:center
Aren't you gonna tell me
why you brought me here?

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:50.598 position:50% align:center
And what's this about
a special guest?

00:14:50.682 --> 00:14:53.393 position:50% align:center
First of all,
Chihiro is my client.

00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:55.979 position:50% align:center
She wanted me to get revenge
against your assailant.

00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:01.443 position:50% align:center
But instead of adding more
suffering to the equation.

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:04.571 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna take a chance based
on what you said earlier.

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:07.449 position:50% align:center
Eye to eye, face to face,
remember?

00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:08.533 position:50% align:center
He's here?

00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:10.869 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
You can come out now!

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:25.592 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and take a seat right
in front of my friend here.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.262 position:50% align:center
This is Tsukasa Hayama.

00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:32.390 position:50% align:center
The man you struck, debilitated,
and robbed that night.

00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:44.778 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
C'mon, Eiji.

00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:47.322 position:50% align:center
You need to face him man to man.

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:49.532 position:50% align:center
Show him that
you're truly sorry--

00:15:52.243 --> 00:15:54.537 position:50% align:center
Why did you choose to attack me?

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:58.583 position:50% align:center
Tell me, what exactly did
you need that money for?

00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:00.001 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:16:00.085 --> 00:16:02.295 position:50% align:center
It really could've been anybody.

00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:04.172 position:50% align:center
I had to protect myself.

00:16:05.507 --> 00:16:07.467 position:50% align:center
If I showed up empty-handed,
they would've hit--

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:08.677 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Cut the crap!

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.679 position:50% align:center
Are you really going to
make this their fault?

00:16:10.762 --> 00:16:13.348 position:50% align:center
Like it has nothing
to do with you?

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:16.768 position:50% align:center
[EIJI] See, my mom passed
away when I was 12.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.941 position:50% align:center
From then on,
it was only me and my father.

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:27.320 position:50% align:center
The bullying started back
when I became a fifth grader.

00:16:27.404 --> 00:16:29.572 position:50% align:center
They said I smelled like a bum.

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:33.410 position:50% align:center
Always calling me out for
wearing the same dirty shirt.

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:35.120 position:50% align:center
You think you had it bad?

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:37.080 position:50% align:center
We had it even worse, y'know.

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:39.916 position:50% align:center
Once I turned 11, I got passed
around to more relatives

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.377 position:50% align:center
than I could count!

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.422 position:50% align:center
I've had to transfer schools
constantly because

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:47.757 position:50% align:center
it never took long for
other kids to learn

00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:49.926 position:50% align:center
I was an orphan.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.303 position:50% align:center
But I didn't lose hope, though.

00:16:52.387 --> 00:16:54.723 position:50% align:center
Wanna know why?

00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:58.059 position:50% align:center
It's because I knew that I'd
see my brother every Sunday.

00:16:58.143 --> 00:17:00.895 position:50% align:center
And that he'd make me
a nice home-cooked dinner.

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:03.273 position:50% align:center
Every meal kept me going.

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:05.275 position:50% align:center
Someday, we would
open a restaurant.

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.777 position:50% align:center
Where you'd leave with
a smile on your face.

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:09.279 position:50% align:center
No matter how depressed
you were when you

00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:10.488 position:50% align:center
came inside,

00:17:10.572 --> 00:17:13.742 position:50% align:center
running that place was
our lifelong dream!

00:17:13.825 --> 00:17:16.619 position:50% align:center
Until the day you
took it all away!

00:17:17.454 --> 00:17:18.663 position:50% align:center
Listen, Eiji.

00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:19.998 position:50% align:center
After you shattered his knee,

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:22.167 position:50% align:center
Tsukasa couldn't work
anymore so he was forced

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.877 position:50% align:center
to leave his job as a chef.

00:17:26.129 --> 00:17:28.131 position:50% align:center
[EIJI]
I had no idea.

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:32.010 position:50% align:center
That was the first time in
my life I ever hurt a person.

00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:33.428 position:50% align:center
As soon as I can get hired,

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:35.722 position:50% align:center
I promise I'll work crazy
hard to make things right!

00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:37.432 position:50% align:center
[CHIHIRO]
Save it!

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:40.185 position:50% align:center
I've seen the miserable
way you choose to live.

00:17:40.268 --> 00:17:44.272 position:50% align:center
You don't do anything
except waste time!

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:46.566 position:50% align:center
That's where you're wrong.

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:48.151 position:50% align:center
It's not like that at all.

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:52.614 position:50% align:center
From the instant I left juvie,

00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:55.825 position:50% align:center
there're these huge
roadblocks everywhere I turn,

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:57.577 position:50% align:center
and I can't seem
to break through!

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:03.917 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI] No one's going
to sympathize with you.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.960 position:50% align:center
What you did won't disappear.

00:18:06.044 --> 00:18:07.879 position:50% align:center
And Tsukasa's leg will
never completely heal

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:10.298 position:50% align:center
back to the way it was.

00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:12.008 position:50% align:center
Just let that sink in.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.303 position:50% align:center
Sir.

00:18:15.387 --> 00:18:17.931 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
Once you've accepted the facts,

00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:19.599 position:50% align:center
you should contemplate
what you can actually

00:18:19.683 --> 00:18:20.642 position:50% align:center
do about it.

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:21.935 position:50% align:center
Take your time.

00:18:23.061 --> 00:18:24.688 position:50% align:center
We'll wait for your answer.

00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:25.897 position:50% align:center
For as long as you need.

00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:08.273 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA] Look, I'm no
stranger to this town, Makoto.

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:09.899 position:50% align:center
Your reputation
for troubleshooting

00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:12.652 position:50% align:center
people's problems
is well-known.

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:14.612 position:50% align:center
Thank you for
praising my cuisine.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.617 position:50% align:center
I won't lie, when I saw
you were back in town,

00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:21.077 position:50% align:center
it made my blood boil.

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:24.789 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
To be fair,

00:19:24.873 --> 00:19:27.125 position:50% align:center
I'm human, after all.

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:28.626 position:50% align:center
On the other hand...

00:19:32.547 --> 00:19:34.758 position:50% align:center
...I suppose you're human too.

00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:36.092 position:50% align:center
Not some monster.

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:39.637 position:50% align:center
I can see that after hearing
what you had to say.

00:19:42.974 --> 00:19:46.061 position:50% align:center
Your sense of guilt will
probably never leave you.

00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:47.437 position:50% align:center
But know this.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.647 position:50% align:center
Even though what
you did was heinous.

00:19:49.731 --> 00:19:51.316 position:50% align:center
I choose to forgive you.

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:55.653 position:50% align:center
Tsukasa, are you
sure about that?

00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:56.905 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:19:56.988 --> 00:19:59.282 position:50% align:center
If I hold onto this,
then there'll be nothing

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:00.825 position:50% align:center
for me to look forward to.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:21.680 position:50% align:center
[EIJI crying]

00:20:21.763 --> 00:20:23.306 position:50% align:center
[crying continues]

00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:42.701 position:50% align:center
[REIICHIROU]
I see. What you did?

00:20:42.784 --> 00:20:44.786 position:50% align:center
We call that
restorative justice.

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:45.995 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Huh?

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:47.664 position:50% align:center
In fact, they're beginning
to implement it

00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:49.499 position:50% align:center
around the country.

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:51.251 position:50% align:center
The victim and the
perpetrator meet each other

00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:53.044 position:50% align:center
and speak face to face.

00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:56.798 position:50% align:center
Aiding in the victim's recovery
and the perp's rehabilitation.

00:20:56.881 --> 00:20:57.924 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:20:58.008 --> 00:21:00.135 position:50% align:center
One might say it's
a reunion of sorts.

00:21:00.218 --> 00:21:01.469 position:50% align:center
For who?

00:21:01.553 --> 00:21:04.014 position:50% align:center
For the individual and
their community.

00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:07.642 position:50% align:center
I guess that makes sense.

00:21:07.726 --> 00:21:09.644 position:50% align:center
Well, good job, Makoto.

00:21:09.728 --> 00:21:12.522 position:50% align:center
This might be weird coming from
Ikebukuros's Chief of Police,

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:14.524 position:50% align:center
but I have a hunch that
this town will be safe

00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:16.026 position:50% align:center
as long as you're around.

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:18.862 position:50% align:center
Must be the whiskey talking.

00:21:24.242 --> 00:21:26.411 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Later on, Takashi and Eiji met

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:28.496 position:50% align:center
with the four small-timers.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.206 position:50% align:center
They promised to
return all the cash

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:31.416 position:50% align:center
they'd ever extorted.

00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:34.669 position:50% align:center
And to never approach
Eiji again, or else.

00:21:36.338 --> 00:21:37.797 position:50% align:center
Which was a fair sentence.

00:21:41.384 --> 00:21:42.802 position:50% align:center
And the Hayamas?

00:21:42.886 --> 00:21:44.471 position:50% align:center
They told me they have
big plans to start

00:21:44.554 --> 00:21:45.847 position:50% align:center
a food truck someday.

00:21:47.349 --> 00:21:50.018 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not, Eiji's
going to help them out, too.

00:21:51.436 --> 00:21:52.812 position:50% align:center
In the end,

00:21:52.896 --> 00:21:55.940 position:50% align:center
we all went on living our
peaceful lives in Ikebukuro.

00:21:56.024 --> 00:21:59.027 position:50% align:center
A place where people leave
their baggage behind.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.154 position:50% align:center
Stepping toward a
brand-new tomorrow.
