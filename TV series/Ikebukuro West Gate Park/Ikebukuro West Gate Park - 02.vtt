[MAKOTO]
Ikebukuro had rules.

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:40.498 position:50% align:center
It didn't matter whether you
were a thrasher, a busker,

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:42.000 position:50% align:center
or a burnout.

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:45.462 position:50% align:center
You fell in line when it
came to the G-Boys.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:49.382 position:50% align:center
And their king? Takashi Andou.

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:52.677 position:50% align:center
The guy was cool as ice.
A leader.

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:55.472 position:50% align:center
Girls loved him,
and guys wanted be him.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.726 position:50% align:center
But then, he showed up.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.270 position:50% align:center
He started dancing
in West Gate Park.

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:04.272 position:50% align:center
At a time when it was packed.

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:06.900 position:50% align:center
And just like that,
he had everybody in the palm

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:08.234 position:50% align:center
of his hand.

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:14.199 position:50% align:center
His name is Kyouichi Ozaki.

00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:17.869 position:50% align:center
A big fish about to make a noisy
splash in our quiet little pond.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:54.716 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE A]
Ladies and gents.

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.343 position:50% align:center
Check out our new special!

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:57.927 position:50% align:center
That's right, people.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:01.139 position:50% align:center
Every order of rice comes with
an extra helping on the house!

00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:03.850 position:50% align:center
What's that?
How much for OK Curry?

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:07.312 position:50% align:center
Two nine. Two nine! 290 yen!

00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:08.980 position:50% align:center
And OK Fried Rice?

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:12.525 position:50% align:center
Three two! Three two! 320 yen!

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.403 position:50% align:center
[MP A] Face it, kid, you're
not cut out for this place.

00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:17.364 position:50% align:center
You might as well quit
while you're behind.

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:20.116 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I'll start
working much harder, sir!

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.619 position:50% align:center
[MP A] You'll start?
That's not good enough!

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.496 position:50% align:center
The company only needs
people who can deliver

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.247 position:50% align:center
results immediately!

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:28.792 position:50% align:center
Not lazy amateur
garbage like you!

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.585 position:50% align:center
[MITSUKI]
Don't fire me! Please!

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.128 position:50% align:center
Shut up and give me 20!

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:35.131 position:50% align:center
Okay. Whatever you say, sir.

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:39.010 position:50% align:center
One... two...

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:40.095 position:50% align:center
...three...

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center
Why, hello there!

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:46.601 position:50% align:center
We here at OK Curry hope
you enjoy your meal today!

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:47.686 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE C]
Thanks for coming!

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.438 position:50% align:center
We really hope
you'll stop by again!

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE B]
Sorry about the wait!

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:53.733 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and dig in!

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:56.194 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
Well, here we are.

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:00.573 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
I'd heard about this place.

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:02.992 position:50% align:center
But I didn't think it
was gonna be this extra.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.119 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:07.664 position:50% align:center
So, how's it taste?

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:11.334 position:50% align:center
It's not too bad.
But it ain't too great either.

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:14.879 position:50% align:center
Dishing out fast, mediocre
food for cheap prices.

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:18.216 position:50% align:center
In today's world, a pretty
typical business model.

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.593 position:50% align:center
And at the foundation are
young adults toiling away

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:22.971 position:50% align:center
for slave wages.

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:25.765 position:50% align:center
Most of 'em lose sleep
trying to pull more hours.

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.269 position:50% align:center
Their mental and physical
health goes down the drain.

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:32.397 position:50% align:center
Not that the public knows
about all of this, of course.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.899 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] If these new guys are
involved, then definitely not.

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:37.152 position:50% align:center
[MASARU]
King?

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50% align:center
And Makoto?

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.448 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Masaru.

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.241 position:50% align:center
Since when did you start
working at this place?

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.704 position:50% align:center
[MASARU] The guy doing
push-ups is my classmate.

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:49.122 position:50% align:center
His name is Mitsuki.

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:51.207 position:50% align:center
He hasn't been working
there for too long.

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.043 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
That was some reprimand he got.

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:54.753 position:50% align:center
What did he do?

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:57.547 position:50% align:center
Nothing, just clocked
in five minutes late.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.798 position:50% align:center
But yeah.

00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:00.425 position:50% align:center
This is his first time
working in food service,

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:02.135 position:50% align:center
so he's super clumsy.

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:05.013 position:50% align:center
That's why the MPs
have it in for him.

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:06.931 position:50% align:center
They go around
from shop to shop.

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:09.351 position:50% align:center
Shakin' us down
like Military Police.

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:10.977 position:50% align:center
Hence the name.

00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:12.520 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
Other than Masaru,

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:16.149 position:50% align:center
there're about 20
G-Boys on payroll for OK.

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:19.027 position:50% align:center
And lately I've received a
number of reports from them

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.404 position:50% align:center
citing abuse and harassment.

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:23.656 position:50% align:center
We've heard stories of some
of the bolder employees

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.992 position:50% align:center
getting angry enough
to fight back.

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:28.995 position:50% align:center
As soon as anyone cries
lawsuit, they get silenced.

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:30.830 position:50% align:center
But not by the MPs.

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.499 position:50% align:center
There's a shadow
group of violent punks

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:34.000 position:50% align:center
who have been showing
up out of nowhere

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:36.461 position:50% align:center
and threatening them into
changing their minds.

00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:39.798 position:50% align:center
Apparently, Masaru has
seen these thugs in action.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50% align:center
It could be the
new gang in town.

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:43.385 position:50% align:center
What are they calling
themselves again?

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:46.304 position:50% align:center
That would be The Red Angels.

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:48.682 position:50% align:center
They're led by Kyouichi Ozaki.

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:51.351 position:50% align:center
He's a scrappy dancer
making big waves.

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:54.145 position:50% align:center
He showed up outta nowhere and
built up his crew overnight.

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:59.234 position:50% align:center
According to rumors,
if you wanna join their ranks,

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:02.153 position:50% align:center
you gotta partake in some
sorta weird secret ceremony.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50% align:center
That being said,

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:06.449 position:50% align:center
I have no intention of
making them our enemies

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:09.244 position:50% align:center
even if they're technically
a potential rival.

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:12.080 position:50% align:center
Everyone gets to do
as they see fit.

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:13.832 position:50% align:center
Because that's Ikebukuro.

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.460 position:50% align:center
Although, I don't appreciate
them backing up

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:20.380 position:50% align:center
that sweatshop and putting
their hands on my men.

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:21.840 position:50% align:center
That's an issue.

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:24.259 position:50% align:center
Well, we don't have much
in terms of evidence.

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:27.804 position:50% align:center
Which is why I want you to
help me uncover the truth.

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:30.056 position:50% align:center
OK Holdings has hired goons.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.683 position:50% align:center
Let's confirm who they are.

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:37.647 position:50% align:center
I really wish that I'd got
a better look at the guys.

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:42.360 position:50% align:center
Ten days ago, I was walking
home with this other coworker.

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:44.946 position:50% align:center
He was pissed off about
how they were treating us.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.783 position:50% align:center
Said he might even
sue for overtime pay.

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:51.619 position:50% align:center
At some point, we went
our separate ways.

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:52.704 position:50% align:center
And then...

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:54.080 position:50% align:center
[YAMAMOTO]
You ungrateful punk!

00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:55.165 position:50% align:center
[MAN grunts]

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:57.667 position:50% align:center
[MASARU]
I ran back, but...

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.883 position:50% align:center
He ended up quitting
right after that.

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:06.801 position:50% align:center
Never did press any charges.

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:13.183 position:50% align:center
No one was able to tie
it back to the company.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:16.519 position:50% align:center
It was dubbed a random
assault, and that was that.

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:18.605 position:50% align:center
So why are some folks saying
it was the Red Angels

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:19.814 position:50% align:center
who did it?

00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:21.232 position:50% align:center
It's a rumor that's
been spreading around

00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:23.151 position:50% align:center
among the G-Boys.

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:25.320 position:50% align:center
Truth is, even though
King doesn't want us

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:27.822 position:50% align:center
getting exploited
by those thugs,

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:30.241 position:50% align:center
I'm not so sure I
wanna call them out.

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:31.659 position:50% align:center
Why is that?

00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:33.411 position:50% align:center
You afraid you might get jumped?

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:35.830 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, there is that.

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:39.626 position:50% align:center
But if I'm being honest,
I'm way better off now.

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:42.587 position:50% align:center
Before this, I worried
my parents sick.

00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:44.089 position:50% align:center
Once I got older,

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:45.965 position:50% align:center
I figured I should
get my act together.

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:50.845 position:50% align:center
So, I packed up and came here.

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:54.724 position:50% align:center
I fell in with the G-Boys,
and finally landed a legit job.

00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:57.727 position:50% align:center
My folks are practically
over the moon with joy.

00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:59.646 position:50% align:center
I guess they're glad I
managed to find a place

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:01.272 position:50% align:center
that would hire me.

00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:03.733 position:50% align:center
I busted my ass
to make it this far,

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.902 position:50% align:center
and I'd like to keep it moving.

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:08.780 position:50% align:center
I'm sure Mitsuki and everyone
else feel the same way.

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:15.036 position:50% align:center
[MASARU]
So. You're doing this, huh?

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.789 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd snoop
around a bit.

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:19.874 position:50% align:center
Let's see what these
Red Angels are all about.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.345 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Where did these
dudes come from?

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.681 position:50% align:center
And why do they look
like they wanna stomp us?

00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:35.765 position:50% align:center
Who can say?

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:37.517 position:50% align:center
Stay close to me, you go that?

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:44.733 position:50% align:center
Wait a second, chill out.

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:46.484 position:50% align:center
You guys can't go starting
fights just because

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:48.987 position:50% align:center
Kyouichi isn't around!

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.281 position:50% align:center
You gotta be Makoto Majima.

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:54.117 position:50% align:center
Which means you're good
buddies with Takashi Andou.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.870 position:50% align:center
I hear you're pretty famous
in this neck of the woods.

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:58.121 position:50% align:center
Here on business?

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:00.665 position:50% align:center
Nah, it's nothing as
official as that, man.

00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:03.501 position:50% align:center
I heard there's a dancer who
puts on quite a performance.

00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:06.338 position:50% align:center
I thought hey, might as well
come check it out myself.

00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:08.506 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid he's not in today.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.217 position:50% align:center
I'd be happy to pass on a
message, if you'd like, though.

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:12.927 position:50% align:center
Nah, I'll swing by later.

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:17.349 position:50% align:center
Say, is he really that good
of a dancer?

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:18.725 position:50% align:center
[TOMOMI]
He is!

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.477 position:50% align:center
Once you see him dance,
you won't know what hit you.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.985 position:50% align:center
[MASARU]
We're still in one piece!

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:31.529 position:50% align:center
So, you got a pretty good
look at all of them.

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:33.740 position:50% align:center
Did any of them back
there look familiar?

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:36.159 position:50% align:center
Uh, I'm not too sure on that.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.327 position:50% align:center
[ONLOOKER A]
Watch out!

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.328 position:50% align:center
[ONLOOKER B]
There's a jumper!

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:39.287 position:50% align:center
[ONLOOKER C]
You see him?

00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:40.830 position:50% align:center
He's got an OK Curry apron on!

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:46.544 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIOKA]
Stay right there.

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.713 position:50% align:center
Let's try to talk this through!

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:50.757 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna keep
living anymore.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.135 position:50% align:center
I'm not cut out for my job,
or society, or this world.

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:55.887 position:50% align:center
There's no place for me here!

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:56.971 position:50% align:center
Mitsuki!

00:09:59.683 --> 00:10:00.934 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Pops, gimme that!

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:02.394 position:50% align:center
Makoto?

00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:03.603 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
This guy works with him.

00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:05.146 position:50% align:center
They grew up together!

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.898 position:50% align:center
Wait, what am I supposed to do?

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:08.233 position:50% align:center
Say something.

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:10.652 position:50% align:center
Talk sense into him until
he backs off the ledge!

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.785 position:50% align:center
[MASARU]
Mitsuki! Bro, can you hear me?

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:21.454 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:23.248 position:50% align:center
This wouldn't've happened
if I hadn't hooked you up

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:25.333 position:50% align:center
with the job!

00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:27.085 position:50% align:center
[MITSUKI]
You're wrong, Masaru.

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:29.963 position:50% align:center
It's because I'm a worthless
and garbage employee.

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:32.007 position:50% align:center
[MASARU]
Screw the company, man!

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.299 position:50% align:center
You can just quit!

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:35.468 position:50% align:center
You don't have to do this!

00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:38.054 position:50% align:center
But then they'd sue me
for breaking my contract.

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:41.850 position:50% align:center
In that case, I'd be making
more trouble for my family!

00:10:41.933 --> 00:10:44.436 position:50% align:center
[MASARU] You don't owe those
managers anything!

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50% align:center
Please!

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:47.522 position:50% align:center
How about you and
me start things over?

00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:50.108 position:50% align:center
If you leave,
then I'll leave with you!

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:53.319 position:50% align:center
You're not worthless
to me, you idiot!

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:54.696 position:50% align:center
Oh, Masaru.

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.871 position:50% align:center
I'm really am sorry, buddy!

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:05.582 position:50% align:center
But I--I need to finish this
before I make any trouble

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.500 position:50% align:center
for you too.

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:08.626 position:50% align:center
Goodbye.

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:12.505 position:50% align:center
[ONLOOKERS yell]

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:22.390 position:50% align:center
[RESCUE A]
Are you all right?

00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:24.476 position:50% align:center
[RESCUE B]
You hurt? Get him an ambulance!

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:34.736 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIOKA] Thanks to you,
he's gonna make it.

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:36.613 position:50% align:center
You should visit him
in the hospital.

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:42.077 position:50% align:center
Makoto, I won't let 'em
get away with this.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.912 position:50% align:center
Mitsuki deserves justice.

00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:46.247 position:50% align:center
I'm ready to do whatever
it takes to expose 'em.

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:48.333 position:50% align:center
They're gonna pay for
overtime, for medical fees,

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:50.335 position:50% align:center
for everything!

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.337 position:50% align:center
I won't let another person jump.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.551 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
Hey, Masaru was attacked.

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:03.473 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO] Five gangsters,
all wearing masks.

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:06.142 position:50% align:center
They happened to catch him
on his commute home.

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:08.561 position:50% align:center
We just received word
two hours ago.

00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:12.065 position:50% align:center
He said that's how long it took
him to be able to use a phone.

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:15.318 position:50% align:center
Well... He's pretty lucky
to still be breathing.

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:17.278 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO] We should've attacked
the Red Angels before they

00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:18.988 position:50% align:center
hit us.

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:20.615 position:50% align:center
Don't you think, boss?

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:22.784 position:50% align:center
[MASARU]
Yo, King.

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:24.244 position:50% align:center
Sorry 'bout the hassle.

00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:26.287 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean to
trouble you guys.

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:28.039 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Looks like someone
had a rough night.

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:29.582 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
Don't talk too much.

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:30.667 position:50% align:center
You need to heal.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.127 position:50% align:center
Nah, I'm all right!

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.462 position:50% align:center
I got more than a few
broken bones, sure.

00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:36.965 position:50% align:center
But they said I'll be
outta here in no time.

00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:39.426 position:50% align:center
And Mitsuki's injuries
weren't too bad either.

00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:43.179 position:50% align:center
Masaru? You know these people?

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:46.516 position:50% align:center
[MASARU] Yeah, King sits at
the top of the gang I run with.

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.101 position:50% align:center
It's a real honor, sir.

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:50.228 position:50% align:center
To think you'd visit
a grunt like me!

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.691 position:50% align:center
[MITSUKI]
So, up until the last few weeks,

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:58.028 position:50% align:center
I honestly never even thought
about ending my own life.

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:01.531 position:50% align:center
But I kept getting
yelled at every day.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.450 position:50% align:center
I started to believe that
no matter where I went,

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:06.161 position:50% align:center
that's how it was going
to be for me forever.

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:08.204 position:50% align:center
I felt hopeless.

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:10.248 position:50% align:center
I'm telling you, buddy,
you're a standup guy,

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:11.916 position:50% align:center
and you should
always remember that.

00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:15.962 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:17.422 position:50% align:center
Why don't you take him under
your wing and let him join

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.090 position:50% align:center
the G-Boys?

00:13:19.174 --> 00:13:21.801 position:50% align:center
He's a bit flaky,
but he means well!

00:13:21.885 --> 00:13:24.220 position:50% align:center
Uh, hold on.
Let's not move too fast.

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:39.903 position:50% align:center
Oh, great. This guy.

00:13:57.087 --> 00:14:00.674 position:50% align:center
Uh, sir, we are in a hospital.

00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:01.758 position:50% align:center
Yo!

00:14:03.218 --> 00:14:05.887 position:50% align:center
Sorry again for showing
up uninvited yesterday.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.305 position:50% align:center
So, what's new?

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:09.516 position:50% align:center
Are you here to visit someone
in the hospital too?

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:11.267 position:50% align:center
Small world, huh?

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:12.852 position:50% align:center
Nice to see you!

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:14.104 position:50% align:center
What a surprise!

00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:15.563 position:50% align:center
How are you doing, man?

00:14:15.647 --> 00:14:17.941 position:50% align:center
Talk about coincidence!

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:20.985 position:50% align:center
Right, Kyouichi?
He's the one I mentioned to you.

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:23.947 position:50% align:center
Makoto Majima. Remember?

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.490 position:50% align:center
The special guest who
went out of his way

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:26.950 position:50% align:center
to meet you yesterday.

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:31.329 position:50% align:center
I apologize for my absence.

00:14:31.413 --> 00:14:33.248 position:50% align:center
It must've been a long trip.

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:36.292 position:50% align:center
So I'm guessing
you're Takashi Andou.

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:38.420 position:50% align:center
The King of Ikebukuro.

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:42.424 position:50% align:center
Kyouichi Ozaki.
Who are you here to see?

00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:45.135 position:50% align:center
We're checking in
on Mister Fujimoto.

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:48.680 position:50% align:center
He may be new to the family,
but he's one of us all the same.

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:50.557 position:50% align:center
Huh?! Is he serious?

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.393 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.
I did mean to tell you earlier.

00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:55.270 position:50% align:center
[MASARU] Uh, yeah, that would
have been good to know.

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:57.939 position:50% align:center
Well, you never told me
about you becoming a G-Boy.

00:14:58.023 --> 00:15:00.025 position:50% align:center
When'd you plan on sharing
that info with me?

00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:02.652 position:50% align:center
Duh, why would I blow
my cover to an outsider?

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:08.283 position:50% align:center
You care enough about your
men to look after them.

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:10.535 position:50% align:center
I didn't know you had it in you.

00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:12.120 position:50% align:center
Guess we aren't so different.

00:15:14.164 --> 00:15:16.291 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
Lemme get this straight.

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:18.126 position:50% align:center
We thought it was
the Red Angels.

00:15:18.209 --> 00:15:20.253 position:50% align:center
And you thought it
was the G-Boys.

00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:21.963 position:50% align:center
Meaning both of us
thought the other team

00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:24.674 position:50% align:center
was spooking workers
on OK Holdings' behalf.

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:26.051 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:27.844 position:50% align:center
We heard that they were
secretly hiring gang members

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:31.014 position:50% align:center
off the street to stamp out
any potential lawsuits.

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:34.142 position:50% align:center
Naturally, we assumed that you
were the gang in question.

00:15:34.225 --> 00:15:35.643 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
Same here.

00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:37.354 position:50% align:center
We knew it wasn't us.

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:40.065 position:50% align:center
Which made you guys
the most logical culprits.

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:41.983 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,
we both have a large number

00:15:42.067 --> 00:15:44.152 position:50% align:center
of people under
their employment.

00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:46.029 position:50% align:center
I'm starting to wonder if
corporate must have spread

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:47.906 position:50% align:center
that rumor knowing we'd hear it.

00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:52.369 position:50% align:center
If you make one faction
believe a potential rival

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:54.788 position:50% align:center
is helping you line your
pockets with cash,

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:57.165 position:50% align:center
and you make the other rival
believe the exact same thing

00:15:57.248 --> 00:15:59.584 position:50% align:center
so that nobody's the wiser,

00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:01.670 position:50% align:center
then you can use both
sides as pawns to keep

00:16:01.753 --> 00:16:03.755 position:50% align:center
all your different
players in check.

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:06.633 position:50% align:center
That way everybody will
be too busy to catch on.

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.677 position:50% align:center
And the powers that be can
take advantage of that

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.845 position:50% align:center
as they please.

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:13.640 position:50% align:center
It's no big deal to them if
we figure their plan out.

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:15.725 position:50% align:center
We're just a bunch of dumb kids.

00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:17.852 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing that's
probably how they see us.

00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:21.022 position:50% align:center
We've been underestimated.

I'm Makoto Majima reporting
for Monthly Street Beat.

00:16:30.865 --> 00:16:32.784 position:50% align:center
Yes. Go right ahead, sir.

00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:35.245 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec.

Since when do you have
a business card?

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:38.998 position:50% align:center
Don't you know I write
a column for them

00:16:39.082 --> 00:16:42.877 position:50% align:center
as a side hustle?
It's kinda popular.

00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:43.962 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:49.300 position:50% align:center
Recently, a valued employee
from one of our restaurants

00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:50.969 position:50% align:center
tried to end his own life.

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:53.930 position:50% align:center
Of course, we do not take
this incident lightly.

00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:55.724 position:50% align:center
At this moment we'd like
to extend our most

00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:57.392 position:50% align:center
heartfelt sympathies.

00:17:02.147 --> 00:17:03.565 position:50% align:center
[JOURNALIST A]
What about other mishaps?

00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:05.859 position:50% align:center
There's been an outcry on
social media regarding rumors

00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:07.402 position:50% align:center
of employee treatment.

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:08.903 position:50% align:center
[OHKI] It's true that
there's been a series of

unfortunate occurrences.

00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:13.533 position:50% align:center
Still, we maintain
the fact that our people

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:16.119 position:50% align:center
work under perfectly
legal conditions.

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:17.829 position:50% align:center
What do you make of the
reports that some of your

00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:19.998 position:50% align:center
young employees have
lost their lives?

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:23.043 position:50% align:center
For the sake of our staff
members who give us their best,

00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:24.753 position:50% align:center
we would like to make
the following comment

00:17:24.836 --> 00:17:26.087 position:50% align:center
loud and clear:

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:32.385 position:50% align:center
When you're OK, then you're
in a good company!

00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:35.221 position:50% align:center
To those we've lost along the
way in this troubled world,

00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:37.557 position:50% align:center
we offer our sincerest
condolences.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.477 position:50% align:center
It's an honor to announce
our latest development.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.480 position:50% align:center
An outreach program in Africa
created in their names.

[MASARU]
Kids are killing themselves!

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:46.399 position:50% align:center
And you're using their
names for PR?!

President Ohki.

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:50.862 position:50% align:center
I've brought someone
who's recently submitted

00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:53.531 position:50% align:center
their formal letter
of resignation.

00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:55.200 position:50% align:center
This man is an acquaintance
of the worker

00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:56.743 position:50% align:center
who attempted suicide.

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:59.204 position:50% align:center
His name is Masaru Taniguchi.

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:01.081 position:50% align:center
He can also attest
to his own abuse,

00:18:01.164 --> 00:18:04.542 position:50% align:center
as he was assaulted around
the time that he quit.

00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:06.419 position:50% align:center
He's contacted an attorney.

00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:08.713 position:50% align:center
They're building a
case as we speak.

00:18:08.797 --> 00:18:09.923 position:50% align:center
President.

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:11.383 position:50% align:center
Do you have anything
you want to say to him?

00:18:13.885 --> 00:18:16.721 position:50% align:center
That's right. Everything we
said today is the truth.

Just can't take a hint, can you?

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:29.109 position:50% align:center
You still haven't learned.

you who bite the hands

[KIMIMOTO]
Listen, punk.

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:40.620 position:50% align:center
We know the names
of your family,

00:18:40.704 --> 00:18:43.665 position:50% align:center
where they live,
and when they're vulnerable.

[MAKOTO]
Wow.

00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:47.419 position:50% align:center
You basically just admitted
you were sent by OK Curry.

00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:58.263 position:50% align:center
Yamamoto. Tsuzuki. Kamioka.
Kagashima. Kimimoto.

[TAKASHI] Five apples too
rotten for any gang to pick.

00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:05.061 position:50% align:center
Finding out who you were
was way too easy.

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:08.273 position:50% align:center
Especially since there
are way more of us.

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:09.441 position:50% align:center
So what's new?

00:19:09.524 --> 00:19:11.568 position:50% align:center
You always got your
lackeys with you.

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:14.112 position:50% align:center
Is it 'cause you can't win
a fight on your own?

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:16.281 position:50% align:center
I suppose I'll have to take
on all of you myself

00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:18.241 position:50% align:center
to shut you up.

00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:20.994 position:50% align:center
Not that I get any pleasure
from taking out garbage.

00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:30.462 position:50% align:center
Make sure you leave Andou to me.
Gonna break his jaw myself.

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:38.345 position:50% align:center
I'll take Muscles here.

Not too shabby.

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:58.425 position:50% align:center
Well then, how about you
quit the Red Angels

00:20:58.508 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
and join us?

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:03.013 position:50% align:center

That's enough of that.

the MVP of our little pack.

[MAKOTO] The MPs from

Serves 'em right for paying
those goons to shake down kids.

00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:26.703 position:50% align:center
How about the president?

00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:28.413 position:50% align:center
Says here he's fallen ill.

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:30.165 position:50% align:center
But the lawsuit is sticking.

00:21:30.248 --> 00:21:33.001 position:50% align:center
I mean, it isn't like he could
keep doing this forever.

00:21:33.084 --> 00:21:34.794 position:50% align:center
The word going around
is that the G-Boys

00:21:34.878 --> 00:21:36.796 position:50% align:center
managed to score
a killer attorney.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.258 position:50% align:center
We have a lot of old members,
so lots of connections.

00:21:40.342 --> 00:21:41.801 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:21:41.885 --> 00:21:43.595 position:50% align:center
We should take
notes from you, then.

00:21:43.678 --> 00:21:45.847 position:50% align:center
Hey, uh, I never got your name.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.767 position:50% align:center
I'm Isogai. Call me Tomomi.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:52.062 position:50% align:center
When it comes to my crews,
you could say I'm the Archangel.

00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:54.230 position:50% align:center
That reminds me.
This is for you.

00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:55.899 position:50% align:center
A present from Kyouichi.

00:21:55.982 --> 00:21:59.611 position:50% align:center
With this thing, you're free to
come and go as you please

00:21:59.694 --> 00:22:01.696 position:50% align:center
wherever the Red Angels gather.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:02.989 position:50% align:center
This'll come in handy.

Thanks a lot, man.

The two gangs chose to coexist.

00:22:09.204 --> 00:22:12.332 position:50% align:center
With the G-Boys in the west
and the Red Angels in the east.

00:22:12.415 --> 00:22:15.543 position:50% align:center
At their respective
gates in Ikebukuro.

00:22:15.627 --> 00:22:18.338 position:50% align:center
But some tensions still
remained, of course.
