[TAKASHI] I'm not the
one who called the hit.

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:19.624 position:50% align:center
No. There's a high probability
that one of the more

did it, but won't confess.

If that ends up being the case,
what'll you do about it?

A tough question to answer.

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:31.469 position:50% align:center
Firstly, I would turn them in
to the police, and then hire

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:35.140 position:50% align:center

do much to mitigate

It's getting cold.

Whenever there's been
conflict in this town,

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:56.036 position:50% align:center
you can bet that there was
someone behind the scenes

00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:58.163 position:50% align:center
stirring up trouble.

00:08:58.246 --> 00:09:00.999 position:50% align:center
Looking to profit
off of the chaos.

Before he got killed,
I think Watanabe

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:27.359 position:50% align:center

Don't move!

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:13.279 position:50% align:center
Reporting to HQ. Please respond.

00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:15.323 position:50% align:center

What happened?

00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:52.152 position:50% align:center
People are going
crazy on the internet.

00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:54.404 position:50% align:center
They're all saying that you
shot the King of Ikebukuro

in cold blood!

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:59.576 position:50% align:center
That Takashi's in the hospital.
It isn't true, right?

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.911 position:50% align:center
You need to tell us everything!

You don't need to worry
about us, okay, kiddo?

I saw the news!
What the hell's going on?

00:13:16.338 --> 00:13:19.341 position:50% align:center
The person who actually
shot Takashi was Mitsuki!

[TOMOMI]
What?!

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:22.177 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Was it Kyouichi's order,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.928 position:50% align:center
or did you have him do it?

00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:24.888 position:50% align:center
Well?

No, of course not!

Maybe someone else though.

Can we meet up?

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:37.275 position:50% align:center
Forget about it,
just find Mitsuki.

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
He wasn't acting
like his normal self.

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:41.112 position:50% align:center

must've drugged him

[REIICHIROU]
Makoto? Where are you?

00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
I am not Takashi's killer.

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:41.107 position:50% align:center
It's a junior Red Angel
named Mitsuki Fujimoto.

00:15:41.191 --> 00:15:42.901 position:50% align:center
Either way, you should
just turn yourself in

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:44.152 position:50% align:center
for the moment.

00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:46.446 position:50% align:center
Tell us where you're at,
and we'll pick you up.

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:48.782 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] I can't,
I'm running out of time.

00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
I need to crack this.

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:53.244 position:50% align:center
To find out who's behind
this whole mess!

00:15:53.328 --> 00:15:56.081 position:50% align:center
Hey. Can you tell me
what the hell is going on?

00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:57.415 position:50% align:center
There are dozens
of fights breaking out

00:15:57.499 --> 00:15:59.084 position:50% align:center
all over Ikebukuro.

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:00.794 position:50% align:center
The city's in complete chaos.

There's an entire
civil war out there.

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:04.798 position:50% align:center
Sunshine Street's a war zone.

00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:07.717 position:50% align:center
Listen, I want to find out
the truth as much as you do.

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:09.344 position:50% align:center
Because if I don't
figure this out soon,

00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:11.137 position:50% align:center
this town will fall apart!

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:13.014 position:50% align:center
Hey, you can leave
that to the police.

00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:14.683 position:50% align:center
So just come quietly.

00:16:14.766 --> 00:16:17.185 position:50% align:center
Plus, it's your safest option.

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:19.729 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] How're Takashi
and my mom holding up?

00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:22.065 position:50% align:center
I did receive word
from the hospital.

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:24.484 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, they're
still unconscious.

00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:27.946 position:50% align:center
But the good news is that
they're both still breathing.

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:29.781 position:50% align:center
Well, at least, that's
better than nothing.

00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:31.533 position:50% align:center

I have already chosen
to do this my way.

Later.

Call Detective Yoshioka.

Breaking news in Ikebukuro,

00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:35.347 position:50% align:center
there've been reports of
violence in the streets.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.974 position:50% align:center
The details are unclear,
but it appears to be

00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:40.769 position:50% align:center
a turf war between two gangs.

00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:43.938 position:50% align:center
Their identifying group
colors are red and blue.

00:17:44.022 --> 00:17:46.358 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, ordinary citizens
dressed in those colors

00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:47.567 position:50% align:center
have been attacked as well,

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.611 position:50% align:center
and the police are
advising caution.

00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:51.196 position:50% align:center

00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:23.895 position:50% align:center
The pics came out of Kobe,

00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:25.647 position:50% align:center
but that's all I'm
certain about.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.358 position:50% align:center
Really?
So not Ikebukuro?

00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:31.194 position:50% align:center
Chances are the
photographer forwarded this

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:32.696 position:50% align:center
to somebody out there.

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:35.907 position:50% align:center
And then they had that person
upload the pics remotely.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.867 position:50% align:center
The guy's cautious.

00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:40.620 position:50% align:center
Well, I'd ask you
who took the photo.

00:18:40.704 --> 00:18:42.997 position:50% align:center
But I'm guessing
that's a no-go too.

00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:44.207 position:50% align:center

00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:58.888 position:50% align:center
Which suggests to me
that whoever framed you

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:00.724 position:50% align:center
knew exactly what
you were up to,

00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:02.392 position:50% align:center

to feed your location

to the G-Boys in real time.

00:19:05.437 --> 00:19:07.439 position:50% align:center
It was a smart move
to turn off your phone

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
before you called
your old cop friend.

00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:12.777 position:50% align:center
The police would've found you.

00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:15.655 position:50% align:center

to trace a phone

It's a nasty spyware app
that steals your data.

Like your location, your calls,
emails, search history--

00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:32.589 position:50% align:center
All of it's sent to another
terminal while you're

secretly installed this.

it to track you.
