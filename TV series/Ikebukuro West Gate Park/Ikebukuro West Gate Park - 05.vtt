[MAKOTO]
Another day in Japan.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:25.316 position:50% align:center
Life for us citizens
is far from perfect.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.527 position:50% align:center
But things could be worse.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.572 position:50% align:center
I never really cared about
that fact very much,

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:33.158 position:50% align:center
but ever since a
certain incident,

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:35.910 position:50% align:center
I think about it
once in a while.

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
This is that story.

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:40.749 position:50% align:center
[REPORTER A]
What a lively scene!

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:43.460 position:50% align:center
There's exciting news
today in Ikebukuro.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:44.836 position:50% align:center
In this district alone,

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:48.089 position:50% align:center
over 200 businesses are
owned by Chinese residents.

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:50.008 position:50% align:center
Now, local shopkeepers
have come together

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:53.053 position:50% align:center
to declare their vision for
Tokyo's latest Chinatown.

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:54.637 position:50% align:center
You've gotta be kidding me.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.348 position:50% align:center
Why support them when
they've never agreed

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.433 position:50% align:center
to join the trader's
association.

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:01.394 position:50% align:center
If you ask me, the way they
run their stores is a joke.

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:03.688 position:50% align:center
Aren't you the woman who always
says to quit complaining

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:04.814 position:50% align:center
and get back to work?

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.149 position:50% align:center
Uh, hello!

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:08.860 position:50% align:center
How did she hear that?

[LIN]
Are you Makoto Majima?

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:12.697 position:50% align:center
I'd like to ask for a favor.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.212 position:50% align:center
[LIN] It's been years since
anyone guessed my ethnicity.

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:53.423 position:50% align:center
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:55.467 position:50% align:center
My name is Lin Gaotai.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.094 position:50% align:center
I advise technical interns
who come here from China

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:00.096 position:50% align:center
seeking employment.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.431 position:50% align:center
Like a recruiter?

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:04.100 position:50% align:center
Your friend Mister Andou
referred me to you.

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:07.187 position:50% align:center
He spoke of a man well-versed
in this town's secrets.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.481 position:50% align:center
Someone who was willing
to act not for money,

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:10.565 position:50% align:center
but for justice.

00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:12.484 position:50% align:center
And he meant you, of course.

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:14.694 position:50% align:center
Would you mind telling me
where you're going with this?

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:17.405 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, one of my
clients has gone missing.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.870 position:50% align:center
[LIN]
Guo Shun Gui. She's 19.

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:25.663 position:50% align:center
Before she vanished,
she was interning at a large

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:28.291 position:50% align:center
sewing factory in Ibaraki.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.960 position:50% align:center
I need you to help me
find her immediately.

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:33.254 position:50% align:center
That's a pretty serious ask,
you can ease up

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:34.673 position:50% align:center
on your approach a little bit.

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:36.841 position:50% align:center
Do pardon my abruptness.

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:38.593 position:50% align:center
I appreciate your time.

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:40.178 position:50% align:center
It's cool.

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:42.681 position:50% align:center
But it's just a lot of stuff for
me to take in at once, you know?

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:43.723 position:50% align:center
Mister Majima.

00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:45.517 position:50% align:center
Dude, just call me Makoto.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.686 position:50% align:center
If you would prefer.

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.729 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I'm just
a bit flustered.

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:50.897 position:50% align:center
In one week,

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.649 position:50% align:center
the Ministry of Health,
Labor, and Welfare

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:55.110 position:50% align:center
will inspect the factory.

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:57.070 position:50% align:center
If Guo isn't there
to be accounted for,

00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:58.697 position:50% align:center
then we're in trouble.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.115 position:50% align:center
What kind of trouble?

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:02.701 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, she and all
of her fellow trainees

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:06.162 position:50% align:center
now face the possibility
of being deported.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:07.372 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
I don't follow.

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:09.582 position:50% align:center
She's the only one
who went missing.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:10.959 position:50% align:center
[LIN]
Perhaps.

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.211 position:50% align:center
But no matter how honest
and hardworking they are,

00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:15.213 position:50% align:center
everyone will be
forced to leave.

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:18.008 position:50% align:center
That's almost 250
displaced workers.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.634 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
That's totally unfair!

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:21.052 position:50% align:center
[LIN]
It's the law.

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:23.680 position:50% align:center
Yet another subtle incongruity
between China and Japan.

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:26.349 position:50% align:center
Why mess up so many lives
over a single person?

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.649 position:50% align:center
"Two hundred thousand
yen a month in Tokyo.

00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:37.444 position:50% align:center
Fellow countrymen
welcome. Donglong."

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:39.612 position:50% align:center
They're a Chinese-run
organization with headquarters

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:41.281 position:50% align:center
in Ikebukuro.

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:42.741 position:50% align:center
And they're hiring?

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:44.617 position:50% align:center
The interns travel straight
from their living quarters

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.161 position:50% align:center
to and from work.

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:48.371 position:50% align:center
This flyer was handed out
at a convenience store

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:49.998 position:50% align:center
close to the dormitory.

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:52.250 position:50% align:center
So, I don't believe that
Guo would've made contact

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:53.626 position:50% align:center
with any civilians.

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:56.880 position:50% align:center
You wanna grab
some lunch with me?

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:58.048 position:50% align:center
I'm starving.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:59.132 position:50% align:center
Let's talk and eat.

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:01.718 position:50% align:center
Happily, Mister Majima.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.261 position:50% align:center
Just Makoto's fine.

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:09.225 position:50% align:center
[LIN] Japanese noodles
truly are delicious.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.103 position:50% align:center
This soy sauce broth
complements the ramen nicely.

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:14.939 position:50% align:center
I wanted to ask.

00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:16.649 position:50% align:center
I don't know much about it,
but I've heard factory work

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:18.234 position:50% align:center
can be pretty demanding
and the conditions

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:20.278 position:50% align:center
for these workers can
be dangerous, right?

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:22.405 position:50% align:center
It's toilsome by
Japanese standards.

00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:26.701 position:50% align:center
To be honest, most well-to-do
Chinese from the city

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:28.203 position:50% align:center
would agree with you.

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
The tourists who can
afford a trip out here

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.582 position:50% align:center
share a similar level of
privilege with people

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:34.042 position:50% align:center
from Tokyo.

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:36.711 position:50% align:center
But it's a different story
in the countryside.

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
While the cost of
living there is cheaper,

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.716 position:50% align:center
a farmer's annual income
doesn't average much more

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.386 position:50% align:center
than several thousand yen.

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:45.679 position:50% align:center
Jeez, that's it?

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:48.264 position:50% align:center
Yes. It's a struggle.

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.558 position:50% align:center
And there are countless
young adults like Guo.

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:53.186 position:50% align:center
They frantically study Japanese
in hopes of improving

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:55.063 position:50% align:center
their chances of
getting slightly closer

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:57.482 position:50% align:center
to a better life.

00:05:57.565 --> 00:06:01.569 position:50% align:center
For the dreamers,
Japan is a land of gold.

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:04.823 position:50% align:center
Because if they make it here,
they can earn three million yen

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:07.075 position:50% align:center
in about three years' time.

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:08.743 position:50% align:center
That's how much
money a farmer makes

00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:11.079 position:50% align:center
tending to his fields
in a lifetime.

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:12.997 position:50% align:center
It's not much either way.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:15.750 position:50% align:center
She's originally from
the province of Henan.

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50% align:center
It's a humid region that's
said to be a perfect symbol

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:20.588 position:50% align:center
of China's social inequality.

00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:22.757 position:50% align:center
'Cause the people there
are like water.

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:25.552 position:50% align:center
Regardless of what measures
the government might take,

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:28.555 position:50% align:center
no matter how much they
strive towards progress,

00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:30.682 position:50% align:center
the impoverished ones
ultimately end up slipping

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.851 position:50% align:center
through the cracks.

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:35.645 position:50% align:center
Such is the bitter state
of poverty in China.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.234 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Guess that explains
why she looks so intense.

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:45.113 position:50% align:center
Her face is a testimony
to terminal injustice.

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:48.825 position:50% align:center
And the perpetual burden
of a life too hard to bear.

Right.

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:14.994 position:50% align:center
They said the Ikebukuro

What do you mean?

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.709 position:50% align:center
Donglong is being backed

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.547 position:50% align:center

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.932 position:50% align:center
That christening in Chinatown
was part of a scheme.

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:39.144 position:50% align:center
Those poor shopkeepers don't
realize they're being played.

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:41.563 position:50% align:center
They talk of business,
but it's just theater.

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:43.523 position:50% align:center
That's why those hoodlums
earlier were trying

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:45.608 position:50% align:center
to extort protection funds.

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:47.485 position:50% align:center
They make money for
Donglong, which in turn

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:51.656 position:50% align:center
generates profit for the
shadow group to enjoy.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.825 position:50% align:center
You sure you're not
some kind of detective?

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:56.036 position:50% align:center
I'm merely a humble
career advisor.

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.539 position:50% align:center
There's no denying we
live in a friendly place

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:00.957 position:50% align:center
with open doors.

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:03.168 position:50% align:center
But a sudden shift in the
power balance could create

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:05.003 position:50% align:center
a breeding ground for chaos.

00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:07.213 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you saying
there's gonna be a war?

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:08.673 position:50% align:center
Who knows?

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:10.550 position:50% align:center
I think it's about time for
us to run these hooligans

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:11.968 position:50% align:center
out of town already!

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:14.637 position:50% align:center
That's up to the Hidaka
Group to decide.

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:15.889 position:50% align:center
It's not our call.

00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:19.768 position:50% align:center
You haven't found the
girl yet, have you?

00:09:19.851 --> 00:09:21.019 position:50% align:center
Not yet.

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:23.438 position:50% align:center
I only just heard about
her this morning.

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.523 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
Whatever you do, be careful.

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:27.025 position:50% align:center
Now get out.

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:28.610 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Jeez, you could at
least say bye or something.

00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:33.656 position:50% align:center
You gonna show up here every
morning like it's your office?

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.200 position:50% align:center
I hope you don't mind.

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:36.993 position:50% align:center
We need to find Guo, right?

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:38.495 position:50% align:center
So where should we look first?

00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:41.998 position:50% align:center
Considering the man
we're dealing with,

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:44.250 position:50% align:center
we should scope out
the red light district.

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:46.503 position:50% align:center
But there's sex being sold
every which way you look

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:47.796 position:50% align:center
in this town, so--

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:50.131 position:50% align:center
Get in.

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:53.635 position:50% align:center
Donglong.

00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:56.388 position:50% align:center
You'll be blindfolded until
we reach our destination.

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:11.986 position:50% align:center
I bid you good afternoon,
representative Yong Fung.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.030 position:50% align:center
We're incredibly grateful
you would spare a moment

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:15.615 position:50% align:center
of your precious time.

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:17.992 position:50% align:center
I am Lin Gaotai,
at your service.

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:19.202 position:50% align:center
That was smooth.

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.121 position:50% align:center
Well, it's our first impression.

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:23.915 position:50% align:center
Let's butter him up and
see what happens next.

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:25.583 position:50% align:center
I can make out
everything the two of you

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:27.293 position:50% align:center
are whispering, you know.

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:29.546 position:50% align:center
How about we drop the
trite formalities and speak

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:30.755 position:50% align:center
man to man?

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.090 position:50% align:center
Apologies.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:34.467 position:50% align:center
Where did you learn how
to be such a sweet-talker?

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:37.971 position:50% align:center
I'm told you're an advisor for
the Henan Province association.

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:39.389 position:50% align:center
For who now?

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:40.598 position:50% align:center
Wait, then that means--

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:42.183 position:50% align:center
Correct.

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:45.395 position:50% align:center
Today, I'm fortunate to play the
privileged position of mentor,

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:49.482 position:50% align:center
but I too was nothing more
than a drop of falling water.

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:52.277 position:50% align:center
And you must be Makoto Majima.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.821 position:50% align:center
I've heard your name come up
a lot around these parts.

00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:56.740 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm glad to hear it.

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:59.200 position:50% align:center
[YANG] I'm sure that this won't
be the last time you and I

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:00.618 position:50% align:center
deal with each other.

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:03.038 position:50% align:center
Well, right now we're just
interested in one thing.

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:05.790 position:50% align:center
You're gonna give us
Guo back or else!

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:07.250 position:50% align:center
Is that right?

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:09.711 position:50% align:center
The Labour Ministry
must've issued a threat.

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:11.546 position:50% align:center
What's he talking about?

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:13.673 position:50% align:center
Changes to the
immigration control laws

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:15.842 position:50% align:center
went into effect recently.

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:18.553 position:50% align:center
Which means that an entire
group of trainees is no longer

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.513 position:50% align:center
in danger of getting
kicked out the country

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:22.015 position:50% align:center
if one of them goes missing.

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:23.308 position:50% align:center
They aren't?

00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:25.518 position:50% align:center
But there are plenty of
factories with terrible

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:27.395 position:50% align:center
conditions out there.

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:29.314 position:50% align:center
The Labour Ministry has
grown annoyed with how

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:31.649 position:50% align:center
ineffective the new
regulations are,

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:33.693 position:50% align:center
which incites those
pencil pushers to assert

00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:36.529 position:50% align:center
their dominance by bullying some
of the more problematic

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:38.823 position:50% align:center
sweatshops into submission.

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:41.451 position:50% align:center
If they find even one
problem upon inspection,

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:45.163 position:50% align:center
then they'll send everybody back
home without asking questions.

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:48.083 position:50% align:center
Won't they, Mister Advisor?

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:50.835 position:50% align:center
Are the working conditions
really as bad as he's saying?

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:53.338 position:50% align:center
Please return
Guo Shun Gui at once.

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:55.715 position:50% align:center
I'm not asking you
for anything else.

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:57.384 position:50% align:center
Now, you listen well.

00:11:57.467 --> 00:12:00.720 position:50% align:center
The honor of Donglong
rests on my shoulders.

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:03.765 position:50% align:center
I refuse to send that poor
defenseless girl back to such

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:06.351 position:50% align:center
demanding and dangerous
working conditions.

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:08.144 position:50% align:center
So you were hiding
Guo all along!

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.855 position:50% align:center
Don't interrupt me
before I'm done talking,

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:12.190 position:50% align:center
stupid punk!

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:14.025 position:50% align:center
Keep sticking your nose
where it doesn't belong

00:12:14.109 --> 00:12:15.902 position:50% align:center
and you won't live to regret it!

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:17.070 position:50% align:center
You hear me!

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:26.746 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, that was a
really short meeting.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.041 position:50% align:center
Hey. That labor camp
stuff is BS, right Lin?

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:32.460 position:50% align:center
Actually, the factory's
notorious for overworking

00:12:32.544 --> 00:12:35.922 position:50% align:center
their employees and paying
them under the minimum wage.

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:38.550 position:50% align:center
That's why the Labor Ministry
is keeping such a focused eye

00:12:38.633 --> 00:12:39.968 position:50% align:center
on them.

00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:42.303 position:50% align:center
But Guo was practically
finished with her probationary

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:44.180 position:50% align:center
training there.

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:46.975 position:50% align:center
I don't see why she left
the factory at this point.

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:49.644 position:50% align:center
I honestly doubt if I
can trust you anymore.

00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:52.397 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you tell me that
you were from Henan earlier?

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.607 position:50% align:center
Who knows what
else you left out?

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:56.943 position:50% align:center
You better spill
everything, right now!

00:12:57.027 --> 00:12:59.988 position:50% align:center
If I told you my story,
you'd never believe it.

00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:02.907 position:50% align:center
You don't know the first thing
about what I've been through.

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:05.201 position:50% align:center
It must be nice to
enjoy such privilege.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.205 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKO]
Inside, both of you.

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:17.172 position:50% align:center
My goodness, I had no idea.

00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:18.840 position:50% align:center
You've gone through
so much, sweetie.

00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:20.342 position:50% align:center
--Sweetie?
--Hey, now!

00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:23.803 position:50% align:center
Lin left his farm and his family
behind to immigrate here.

00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:26.014 position:50% align:center
He worked his butt off
to get to where he is today,

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:27.599 position:50% align:center
so show him some respect!

00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:30.101 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Mom, I was here when
he said all of that stuff.

00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:32.312 position:50% align:center
Then instead of mouthing off,
you should do the right thing

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:34.856 position:50% align:center
and help him rescue
the poor Chinese girl!

00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:38.651 position:50% align:center
Thank you, ma'am.
You're too kind.

00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:40.945 position:50% align:center
Look at you being
all respectful.

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:43.281 position:50% align:center
Way to make a woman
feel appreciated.

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:45.825 position:50% align:center
But no need to fuss,
just treat me like your mom

00:13:45.909 --> 00:13:47.369 position:50% align:center
away from home.

00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:50.538 position:50% align:center
Oh. Well as luck would have it,
I've got one of those already.

00:13:50.622 --> 00:13:54.501 position:50% align:center
And thanks to her, I'm actually
a naturalized Japanese citizen.

00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:57.087 position:50% align:center
She was an older woman
who lived nearby me.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.089 position:50% align:center
I met her by chance back
in the days when I was

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:02.050 position:50% align:center
grinding away at a
warehouse in Kawasaki.

00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:04.636 position:50% align:center
Her sympathy for me grew
into a deep maternal affection

00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:06.680 position:50% align:center
and she ended up adopting me.

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:08.807 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, that's kind of awesome.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.393 position:50% align:center
Thank you for sharing
your story with us.

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:14.020 position:50% align:center
C'mon. Why're you
just sitting there?

00:14:14.104 --> 00:14:16.356 position:50% align:center
Hurry up and go
look for Miss Guo!

00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:17.399 position:50% align:center
Bye, Lin.

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.192 position:50% align:center
Stop by anytime.

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:21.528 position:50% align:center
I'll even treat you to
a home-cooked dinner.

00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:23.238 position:50% align:center
Looking forward to it, Mom.

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:24.364 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:26.825 position:50% align:center
She can't resist
a good sob story.

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:36.751 position:50% align:center
[LIN]
We're running out of time.

00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:39.838 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] I know.
And we've still got no leads.

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:41.464 position:50% align:center
So, what now?

00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:44.092 position:50% align:center
We shouldn't lose
our faith just yet.

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:47.345 position:50% align:center
Lucky for us, I still have one
more trick up my sleeve.

00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:49.347 position:50% align:center
I should be getting
a call any minute now.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.101 position:50% align:center
[LIN]
Wei?

00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:54.519 position:50% align:center
Ah, <i>yang xiansheng</i> .

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:58.773 position:50% align:center
Of course. Yes, sir.

00:14:58.857 --> 00:15:00.275 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much.

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:02.027 position:50% align:center
<i>Mei guan xi</i> .

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.445 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
<i>Mei guan</i> what?

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:06.698 position:50% align:center
Roughly translated, it
means everything is all right.

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:07.949 position:50% align:center
And it is.

00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:11.202 position:50% align:center
We can find Guo at the
China Doll hostess club.

00:15:11.286 --> 00:15:14.706 position:50% align:center
It seems that our friend Yang
finally agreed to release her.

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:15.915 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Wait, really?

00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:18.668 position:50% align:center
Hold on, how the hell
did you manage that?

00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:20.837 position:50% align:center
[LIN] I called Yong's
boss in Shanghai.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.131 position:50% align:center
He managed to pull
some strings for me.

00:15:23.214 --> 00:15:24.966 position:50% align:center
But now I owe the man a favor,

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.719 position:50% align:center
which is why I didn't go
to him in the first place.

00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
So, you're saying we could've
solved this a lot earlier.

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:31.765 position:50% align:center
Come with me.

00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:34.267 position:50% align:center
Let's go after Guo
before it's too late.

00:15:34.351 --> 00:15:36.978 position:50% align:center
And what if she says she
doesn't want to come back?

00:15:37.062 --> 00:15:39.064 position:50% align:center
Then I would appreciate
it if you did your best

00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:40.774 position:50% align:center
to convince her
that she's wrong.

00:15:40.857 --> 00:15:41.941 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Huh?

00:15:42.025 --> 00:15:43.526 position:50% align:center
You have nothing
to do with this,

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.571 position:50% align:center
which means you're unbiased
and she might actually listen.

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:49.240 position:50% align:center
That's why you
asked for my help?

00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:50.450 position:50% align:center
Quickly, please.

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:51.618 position:50% align:center
Dammit!

00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:02.462 position:50% align:center
So, what do you want from me?

00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:04.756 position:50% align:center
First things first, I swear
I've got nothing to do

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:07.300 position:50% align:center
with the police or the
government, so you can relax.

00:16:07.384 --> 00:16:10.428 position:50% align:center
I had a gut feeling that Lin
would come find me eventually.

00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:14.099 position:50% align:center
But I'm not going back there.

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:17.394 position:50% align:center
No matter what I have to do,
I need to keep on working.

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:19.396 position:50% align:center
Mind telling me why?

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:21.439 position:50% align:center
I recently got a letter
from my little brother

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:23.942 position:50% align:center
that had bad news in it.

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:27.445 position:50% align:center
He said my father's kidney
disease was getting worse.

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:29.864 position:50% align:center
The only way to save
him is a transplant.

00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:33.410 position:50% align:center
Which means I have to
find a way to save up

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:36.246 position:50% align:center
for the surgery
as fast as possible.

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:39.457 position:50% align:center
If I don't do it in time, I
might lose my dad forever!

00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:44.504 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:47.007 position:50% align:center
When I first started
studying Japanese,

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.217 position:50% align:center
this pen was my good luck charm.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.429 position:50% align:center
It's the first one I used, and I
kept it after the ink ran out.

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:56.516 position:50% align:center
It's strange, but I
sympathize with it.

00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:58.935 position:50% align:center
Because I've tried so hard,
but in the end, I have

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:00.270 position:50% align:center
absolutely nothing.

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:02.105 position:50% align:center
Listen, I'm not gonna
sit here and tell you

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:04.315 position:50% align:center
to let your father die.

00:17:04.399 --> 00:17:06.776 position:50% align:center
Though at the same time,
risking your neck like this

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.571 position:50% align:center
doesn't seem like
a good idea either.

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:12.615 position:50% align:center
But if you don't return
to the factory...

00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:15.744 position:50% align:center
...about 250 people are
gonna get deported.

00:17:15.827 --> 00:17:18.413 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. Please, I had no idea!

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:20.874 position:50% align:center
You have one more day
to make a decision.

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:22.584 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry to have to rush you.

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:25.378 position:50% align:center
But all I'm asking is for you
to think about things carefully.

00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:34.471 position:50% align:center
[LIN]
Hello, Mom. Good morning.

00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:36.556 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much
for giving Guo

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:38.516 position:50% align:center
a place to stay last night.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.643 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd drop off
a few sweets for you.

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:43.313 position:50% align:center
How kind. You shouldn't have.

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:45.732 position:50% align:center
Oh, and if you're looking
for those two, they've left.

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:50.487 position:50% align:center
Your girl decided
to return to Ibaraki.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.198 position:50% align:center
While she was here, she
carefully thought it over.

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:56.201 position:50% align:center
Said she didn't wanna cause
trouble for the other trainees.

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:57.494 position:50% align:center
Good to know.

00:17:57.577 --> 00:18:00.830 position:50% align:center
She also wanted to see
Tokyo one last time.

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:04.292 position:50% align:center
Makoto volunteered
to show her 'round.

00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:07.629 position:50% align:center
The only crime that poor girl's
committed is working too hard.

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:10.507 position:50% align:center
Life can be extremely
unfair sometimes, can't it?

00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:14.761 position:50% align:center
Anyway, we're throwing her
a farewell party tonight,

00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:16.388 position:50% align:center
so make sure to come eat.

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:17.597 position:50% align:center
Oh, I will.

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:29.818 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Yo.

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:31.027 position:50% align:center
Hey, look who it is.

00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:32.153 position:50% align:center
Are you on a date?

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:33.988 position:50% align:center
Nah, just giving a tour.

00:18:34.072 --> 00:18:35.198 position:50% align:center
[CAT meows]

00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:38.702 position:50% align:center
Wow, you came all
the way from China?

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:39.703 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:42.205 position:50% align:center
Living overseas
can be a struggle.

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:44.165 position:50% align:center
Like when I used
to live in Chicago.

00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:45.709 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:48.169 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Kyouichi was a member
of a ballet troupe out there.

00:18:48.253 --> 00:18:50.755 position:50% align:center
The principal dancer
who played a lot of princes.

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:52.090 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.

00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:54.634 position:50% align:center
I can't even imagine what
the day to day is like.

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:56.553 position:50% align:center
Compared to what
this girl's seen,

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:58.555 position:50% align:center
I bet it's nothing
she couldn't handle.

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:08.648 position:50% align:center
[GUO] There are skyscrapers
everywhere you look.

00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:10.942 position:50% align:center
Not to mention all the
nice cars on the street.

00:19:11.026 --> 00:19:12.527 position:50% align:center
If you're sick, you don't
have to worry about

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.612 position:50% align:center
huge hospital bills.

00:19:14.696 --> 00:19:17.240 position:50% align:center
All the girls are
so cute and lovely,

00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:19.659 position:50% align:center
and the boys are so
friendly and stylish.

00:19:19.743 --> 00:19:22.912 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you get to
live in such a great place.

00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:24.873 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess it is pretty nice.

00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:28.960 position:50% align:center
You know, it's a shame I have
to leave this city tomorrow.

00:19:29.044 --> 00:19:30.211 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Yeah.

00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:33.214 position:50% align:center
[GUO] My dad's situation
is really tough.

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:36.718 position:50% align:center
But I'm pretty sure he'd
agree with my decision.

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:38.553 position:50% align:center
It's not just the two of us.

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:41.056 position:50% align:center
I have a little brother
and sister too.

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:43.058 position:50% align:center
And a good education
isn't cheap.

00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:46.895 position:50% align:center
Since I'm doing it
for their future,

00:19:46.978 --> 00:19:49.356 position:50% align:center
I'm positive my father
would understand.

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:02.619 position:50% align:center
So good!

00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:05.038 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? Go on, dig in.

00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:06.790 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way, Lin.

00:20:06.873 --> 00:20:08.458 position:50% align:center
You're quite a sneaky man.

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:10.543 position:50% align:center
Makoto's still a kid, you know.

00:20:10.627 --> 00:20:11.795 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:14.839 position:50% align:center
And Guo truly is such a
brave and special girl.

00:20:14.923 --> 00:20:17.509 position:50% align:center
I feel like I can't
resist your little plan.

00:20:17.592 --> 00:20:20.011 position:50% align:center
I promise I didn't set out
with the intention of asking

00:20:20.095 --> 00:20:22.555 position:50% align:center
such an unreasonable
request of anyone.

00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:25.183 position:50% align:center
Huh? The heck are you
guys talking about?

00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:28.645 position:50% align:center
A lot of complications came up
because of Guo's legal status.

00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:31.064 position:50% align:center
But if she became a citizen
in the same way Lin did,

00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:33.108 position:50% align:center
then things would
be easier for her.

00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:35.318 position:50% align:center
She wouldn't be
facing deportation.

00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:38.238 position:50% align:center
And she'd be allowed to work
wherever her heart desired.

00:20:38.321 --> 00:20:39.447 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:20:39.531 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
Does that mean you're
going to adopt her?

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:46.538 position:50% align:center
I am. As long as Guo
thinks it's a good idea.

00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:49.207 position:50% align:center
Funnily enough, looking at
her hands is what got me

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.750 position:50% align:center
thinking about it yesterday.

00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:56.423 position:50% align:center
Given the chance,
I bet they'll help her do

00:20:56.506 --> 00:20:58.633 position:50% align:center
some incredible things someday.

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:01.052 position:50% align:center
Besides, I can't stand by and
let her father slip through

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:02.595 position:50% align:center
the cracks.

00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:04.222 position:50% align:center
What do you think, dear?

00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:05.598 position:50% align:center
Even if it's only on paper,

00:21:05.682 --> 00:21:08.560 position:50% align:center
how would you like to be
Makoto's little sister?

00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:10.520 position:50% align:center
We don't have much,
but we get by,

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:12.397 position:50% align:center
and you could have meals
like this every night

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.857 position:50% align:center
if you enjoy them.

00:21:20.113 --> 00:21:22.115 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much!

00:21:22.198 --> 00:21:24.451 position:50% align:center
If you'll have me, then I will
do everything in my power

00:21:24.534 --> 00:21:27.662 position:50% align:center
to help you around the shop
while supporting my father!

00:21:27.746 --> 00:21:31.416 position:50% align:center
Does this mean I can stay at
your place here in Ikebukuro?

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:32.500 position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:21:33.501 --> 00:21:34.753 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Lin.

00:21:34.836 --> 00:21:36.254 position:50% align:center
You brought up adoption
the other day on purpose,

00:21:36.338 --> 00:21:37.797 position:50% align:center
didn't you?

00:21:37.881 --> 00:21:40.842 position:50% align:center
I am eternally grateful for
everything you've done for us.

00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:41.926 position:50% align:center
<i>Xiexie</i> .

00:21:43.595 --> 00:21:44.763 position:50% align:center
This guy.

00:21:46.056 --> 00:21:48.183 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
And on the following day,

00:21:48.266 --> 00:21:50.477 position:50% align:center
Lin started the process
for Guo's adoption.

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:53.521 position:50% align:center
It's going to take some time.

00:21:53.605 --> 00:21:56.691 position:50% align:center
But for now, her trainee
contract is cancelled.

00:21:56.775 --> 00:21:58.651 position:50% align:center
And the other workers
got to stay, too.

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:03.656 position:50% align:center
Growing up on the streets
of this peaceful town.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.367 position:50% align:center
It never even crossed
my mind that things

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.535 position:50% align:center
might not be that bad.

00:22:07.619 --> 00:22:09.829 position:50% align:center
But, when I got a brand-new
sister thanks to my

00:22:09.913 --> 00:22:13.166 position:50% align:center
bleeding-heart mom,
I had to wonder.

00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:16.127 position:50% align:center
Even though life in Japan
is far from perfect,

00:22:16.211 --> 00:22:18.588 position:50% align:center
maybe it's a little better
than I give it credit for.
