00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:23.398 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Sometimes when
you're out and about,

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:25.608 position:50% align:center
you stumble upon a quiet place.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.152 position:50% align:center
Somewhere the air is still.

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:30.613 position:50% align:center
Where someone passed away,

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.157 position:50% align:center
where someone who
cared about that person

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.744 position:50% align:center
might leave flowers behind
to remember them.

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:37.620 position:50% align:center
What if you knew the deceased?

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.706 position:50% align:center
What would you do if you
lost someone you loved?

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.293 position:50% align:center
There's an old man I look up
to who could tell you

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:44.627 position:50% align:center
the answer.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:45.962 position:50% align:center
This is his story.

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:19.973 position:50% align:center
[TISSUE SELLER]
Happy holidays to all!

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:34.529 position:50% align:center
[YASUHIRO]
Um, excuse me.

00:02:34.612 --> 00:02:38.241 position:50% align:center
Do you happen to pass through
this neighborhood often?

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:41.619 position:50% align:center
If that sign jogs any memories,
then I'd like to hear them.

00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:44.039 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Here you go.

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:45.373 position:50% align:center
Thanks, 'preciate it.

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:52.172 position:50% align:center
You know, if my son
were still alive,

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:53.548 position:50% align:center
he'd be about your age.

00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:55.050 position:50% align:center
Well, what do you know.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:57.052 position:50% align:center
You'd be about as old
as my dead father.

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:03.975 position:50% align:center
Toshi was my only son.

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.102 position:50% align:center
Made a bit of a name
for himself in Ueno

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.021 position:50% align:center
where he led a street gang.

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.357 position:50% align:center
I suppose that counts
for something, right?

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.735 position:50% align:center
I raised him by myself, so he
was a lot to handle sometimes.

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:15.904 position:50% align:center
But he was also kind,
and cared about his guys

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:17.322 position:50% align:center
like they were family.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.451 position:50% align:center
It was five years ago today.

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:25.038 position:50% align:center
I received an urgent call
to come to the hospital.

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:28.124 position:50% align:center
His body was already
cold when I got there.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.835 position:50% align:center
He did have a temper,
so he could've just

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.088 position:50% align:center
pissed off the wrong guy.

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:34.297 position:50% align:center
Tell me.

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:36.216 position:50% align:center
What do you know about
any local gang activity

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.717 position:50% align:center
or members?

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:40.428 position:50% align:center
I'd appreciate any information
you might have about them.

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:41.554 position:50% align:center
Sure thing.

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center
We could all use
some help these days.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.891 position:50% align:center
I'll see what I can gather.

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:46.601 position:50% align:center
Ah, thank you so much.

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:47.977 position:50% align:center
[AKIHIRO]
Grandpa!

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:50.980 position:50% align:center
[YASUHIRO]
Oh, there you are!

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.607 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:54.234 position:50% align:center
Come over here and
introduce yourself

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:56.111 position:50% align:center
to my new friend Makoto.

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:57.821 position:50% align:center
Don't be shy, now!

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:00.323 position:50% align:center
Hello, I'm Akihiro Matsuda.

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:02.033 position:50% align:center
I'm four years old,
and my favorite foods

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:03.702 position:50% align:center
are apples and melon!

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:04.994 position:50% align:center
Well, aren't you lucky?

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.414 position:50% align:center
Me and my mom sell the
best fruits at our shop.

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:10.000 position:50% align:center
The next time we meet, I'll
bring you whatever's left over.

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:13.503 position:50% align:center
It was sweet of you to
sit with Grandpa Nanjou

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:15.046 position:50% align:center
and hear his story out.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.882 position:50% align:center
I'm Harumi. Akihiro's mother.

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:21.094 position:50% align:center
Oh, hi. I'm Makoto Majima.

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:23.388 position:50% align:center
[APOLLO A]
That you, ma'am? It's been ages!

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.265 position:50% align:center
Keep your voice down, would you?

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:28.685 position:50% align:center
I'm not on the team anymore,
so I don't need the attention.

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:31.229 position:50% align:center
[APOLLO A]
Number Two's not with you today?

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:34.107 position:50% align:center
Kouji? He's tied up
with work at the moment.

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:39.195 position:50% align:center
[HARUMI gasps]

00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:48.413 position:50% align:center
Okay, time to kiss
Grandpa goodbye.

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:50.832 position:50% align:center
[YASUHIRO]
Already? I could walk you home.

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:53.251 position:50% align:center
I'd love that, but we've
got an errand to run.

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:54.794 position:50% align:center
[YASUHIRO]
This late?

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:57.964 position:50% align:center
In that case I'll swing by later
to drop off Christmas gifts.

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:02.218 position:50% align:center
Now, then.
Where do you live, son?

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.137 position:50% align:center
Least I can do is
give you a ride home.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.513 position:50% align:center
Nah, I'm pretty close.

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:06.806 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna trouble you.

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:09.601 position:50% align:center
Humor me, please.

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
We could still
get in a song or two.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.855 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
A song?

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:17.275 position:50% align:center
[YASUHIRO] Haven't you
ever been in a jazz taxi?

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:19.486 position:50% align:center
There's a first time
for everything, I guess.

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:20.487 position:50% align:center
[YASUHIRO]
Here.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.614 position:50% align:center
Pick any track your
heart desires.

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:25.617 position:50% align:center
I can't move till we've set
the mood for the journey.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.911 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Hmm. Okay. This one.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.497 position:50% align:center
[YASUHIRO]
Ooh. So "Night Train," eh?

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.624 position:50% align:center
You've got good taste
for such a young guy.

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:08.201 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzing]

00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:12.956 position:50% align:center
I hope you've got
good news, Takashi.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.709 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI] I had some of my
men ask around for intel,

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.544 position:50% align:center
but no dice.

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:19.254 position:50% align:center
And the ex-G-Boys?

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:22.090 position:50% align:center
None of 'em knew about any
murders from five years back.

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:23.258 position:50% align:center
That so?

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:25.677 position:50% align:center
Well, thanks for checking
it out anyway.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.929 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
It wasn't a total wash.

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:29.931 position:50% align:center
I got a lead about
a gang in Ueno.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:34.811 position:50% align:center
It seems this gang was
founded by your Toshi.

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:36.438 position:50% align:center
They call themselves
Team Apollo.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.400 position:50% align:center
They're on their
third leader now.

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:41.693 position:50% align:center
Name's Rintarou.

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:52.203 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Stout, please.

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:03.048 position:50% align:center
I'm researching a column for
a local fashion magazine.

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:04.632 position:50% align:center
I wonder if there's anyone
here who can tell me

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:06.593 position:50% align:center
about the late great Toshi?

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.307 position:50% align:center
As it turns out,
I happened to catch a taxi

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.892 position:50% align:center
with the guy's old man.

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:15.435 position:50% align:center
So how about it?

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.228 position:50% align:center
I'd love to do
this story justice.

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:21.483 position:50% align:center
You won't get
any help from us.

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:24.110 position:50% align:center
If you're smart, friend, you
won't go digging up the past.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.364 position:50% align:center
You speaking for
the entire Team?

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:29.616 position:50% align:center
Or is this threat
just coming from you?

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.785 position:50% align:center
I'm just trying
to do you a favor.

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:33.370 position:50% align:center
No one's talking.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.246 position:50% align:center
Finish your beer
and get your ass out.

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:39.250 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
It's all yours.

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:04.776 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
I got it. Thanks.

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:15.453 position:50% align:center
Hope you had a change
of heart and came to tell me

00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:16.830 position:50% align:center
the full story.

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:19.416 position:50% align:center
I already warned you,
there ain't nothing to tell.

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:20.583 position:50% align:center
I don't know
what you're pulling,

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.627 position:50% align:center
but you aren't
supposed to be here.

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:24.045 position:50% align:center
You sure about that?

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:26.172 position:50% align:center
I'm not somebody
who gives up easily.

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:27.257 position:50% align:center
You asshole!

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.301 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.471 position:50% align:center
[APOLLO B]
Get him!

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:36.599 position:50% align:center
[UENO A]
A fight?

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:38.184 position:50% align:center
[UENO A]
We should call the cops.

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:39.310 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO grunts]

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.564 position:50% align:center
Stay outta Ueno, you got that?

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:44.858 position:50% align:center
The next time you try
to show your face here,

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:47.068 position:50% align:center
we won't hold back against you.

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:49.195 position:50% align:center
That's a promise from
all of Team Apollo.

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:57.704 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKO]
Makoto!

00:08:57.787 --> 00:09:00.415 position:50% align:center
A nice man named
Nanjou's here to say hello!

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
What the heck happened to you?

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:06.755 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's a regular
occurrence around here.

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:08.006 position:50% align:center
He can take a beating or two,

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:10.383 position:50% align:center
so there's no reason
to get too worried.

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:12.427 position:50% align:center
I was in Ueno.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.305 position:50% align:center
My new plan's to sort things
out with Apollo's leader.

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:16.931 position:50% align:center
Did you find anything?

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:18.975 position:50% align:center
I think they might be hiding
something important

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:20.352 position:50% align:center
about your son.

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:24.314 position:50% align:center
[APOLLO B]
You don't learn, do you?

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.982 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
I've got backup.

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:28.234 position:50% align:center
Toshi's father is outside.

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:29.819 position:50% align:center
Which is why you're gonna
cough up what you know

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:31.404 position:50% align:center
about your old boss.

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:35.200 position:50% align:center
Or don't, and I'll have
to bring in Pops.

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:37.118 position:50% align:center
You can lie to his face.

00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:38.203 position:50% align:center
Got it?

00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:41.623 position:50% align:center
Look at you acting
like you're all hard.

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:43.958 position:50% align:center
You think you're smart,
but you don't know jack.

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:46.169 position:50% align:center
I don't plan to let up until
you've told me everything

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:47.754 position:50% align:center
that I came to hear.

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:53.301 position:50% align:center
[APOLLO B]
You look like crap.

00:09:53.385 --> 00:09:54.594 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:56.763 position:50% align:center
Should be a crime to
mess up this pretty face.

00:09:58.348 --> 00:10:01.017 position:50% align:center
[APOLLO B] Fine. I'll get you in
touch with the big guy.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.438 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
You the head of Apollo?

00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:09.317 position:50% align:center
That's right, Rintarou Nagai.

00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:11.111 position:50% align:center
Is there something
I can help you with?

00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:13.863 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Sorry to bother you.

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:15.907 position:50% align:center
Let me get right to the point.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.577 position:50% align:center
I want you to share whatever
secrets you have about Toshi.

00:10:19.661 --> 00:10:21.579 position:50% align:center
Whether they're secrets
or not mostly depends on

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:24.040 position:50% align:center
what his father
told you already.

00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:25.667 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
He said he was a single parent,

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.377 position:50% align:center
and that he's proud of his kid.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.005 position:50% align:center
That the boy was kind,
a stand-up guy.

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:31.131 position:50% align:center
Is that true?

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:34.384 position:50% align:center
Sometimes, yeah.

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.219 position:50% align:center
But man, did he
have a nasty habit

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:38.346 position:50% align:center
of playing mind games
with us members.

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:42.225 position:50% align:center
You never knew
which boss you'd get.

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:45.770 position:50% align:center
Harumi's new husband, Kouji,
took over after Toshi died.

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:48.481 position:50% align:center
But Kouji used to get it just
as bad as the rest of us.

00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:53.987 position:50% align:center
And yet, if he was in good
mood, Toshi was a saint.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.866 position:50% align:center
When my sister was hospitalized,
he was the first guy to visit.

00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:59.743 position:50% align:center
Even brought flowers for her.

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:02.662 position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone's got
their bad days, you know?

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:05.457 position:50% align:center
Fair, but do you punch
women on a rough one?

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.792 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you saying
that Toshi did?

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:09.252 position:50% align:center
Bingo.

00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:12.339 position:50% align:center
And Harumi lived with him,
so she got the worst of it.

00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:16.217 position:50% align:center
We might've been tough
back in the day, sure,

00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:18.303 position:50% align:center
but it was Kouji who made
us the force of nature

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:20.305 position:50% align:center
that we are today.

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:23.558 position:50% align:center
If things were different
and Toshi was still with us,

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:25.769 position:50% align:center
he would've burned
Apollo to the ground.

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:31.274 position:50% align:center
That's about all I can say.

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:33.360 position:50% align:center
If there's anything
else you must know,

00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:35.153 position:50% align:center
you gotta ask Harumi yourself.

00:11:36.988 --> 00:11:41.493 position:50% align:center
Oh, right, and be careful
when you fill in the old man.

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:44.245 position:50% align:center
His kid's already gone, so
there's no point in pouring

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:45.789 position:50% align:center
salt on the wound.

00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:56.257 position:50% align:center
[YASUHIRO] They say that
children are born innocent,

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:58.009 position:50% align:center
and I couldn't agree
with it more.

00:11:58.093 --> 00:11:59.469 position:50% align:center
I mean, just look at them.

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:02.013 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe
Toshi was like that once.

00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:05.767 position:50% align:center
Then before I knew it, he ran
off to join up with a gang.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.938 position:50% align:center
Listen, you'd better not make
that dear mother of yours cry.

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:12.607 position:50% align:center
Nah, she's the one who
always makes me cry.

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:14.818 position:50% align:center
And then we made cookies!

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Don't freak out.

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:20.115 position:50% align:center
Look, I hit up boss number three
and he filled me in on things.

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:23.076 position:50% align:center
There's just one more question
that's been eatin' at me.

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:24.202 position:50% align:center
Do you mind?

00:12:26.121 --> 00:12:28.248 position:50% align:center
Akihiro is Kouji's kid,
isn't he?

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:30.834 position:50% align:center
Look at this, Grandpa!

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:33.378 position:50% align:center
[YASUHIRO] Wow, that's the
biggest I've ever seen!

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:35.213 position:50% align:center
[AKIHIRO laughs]

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:38.508 position:50% align:center
Yes. That's Kouji's
child over there.

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:41.302 position:50% align:center
Toshi would often raise his
hands towards me in anger.

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:44.597 position:50% align:center
Kouji would defend me
and get hit, too.

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:46.391 position:50% align:center
Both of us suffered.

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:49.185 position:50% align:center
But then, we had each other.

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:52.856 position:50% align:center
It wasn't long until we
began to meet in secret.

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:55.400 position:50% align:center
Wait.
What are you going to do?

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:58.486 position:50% align:center
You're not planning to
tell Nanjou, are you?

00:12:58.570 --> 00:12:59.571 position:50% align:center
'Course not.

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:01.698 position:50% align:center
I'll find some way
to hide that part.

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:03.533 position:50% align:center
People don't need to
know every little detail

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.118 position:50% align:center
in a story like this one.

00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:12.042 position:50% align:center
Thing is, sometimes
I'm so torn up,

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.085 position:50% align:center
I feel this overwhelming
impulse to confess

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50% align:center
everything to the man.

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:17.464 position:50% align:center
Especially when
he's with my son.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
If there's still something
important you feel

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.890 position:50% align:center
that you need to own up to,
I'm more than willing to listen.

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:29.642 position:50% align:center
And what good would
telling you do?

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:30.894 position:50% align:center
Spare me.

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:33.480 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who lives
with this lie, not you.

00:13:33.563 --> 00:13:36.441 position:50% align:center
This isn't some fairy tale
where everybody's happy.

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:38.151 position:50% align:center
No white knight,
no peaceful ending,

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:40.403 position:50% align:center
just one long, shitty existence!

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:51.331 position:50% align:center
So, five years ago,
I finally told Toshi the truth.

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:55.335 position:50% align:center
That I wanted to leave,
how I'd met someone else.

00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:56.836 position:50% align:center
He went in as usual.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.421 position:50% align:center
But no matter how
much he hit me,

00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:00.340 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't let him hit my son.

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:04.594 position:50% align:center
Eventually he noticed.

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:06.763 position:50% align:center
He asked me why
I was holding my belly.

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:12.644 position:50% align:center
I shouted that I was
pregnant, and I told him

00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:16.648 position:50% align:center
the baby inside
of me wasn't his.

00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:19.192 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
What did he do next?

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:22.195 position:50% align:center
He ran away,
straight out the door.

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:24.906 position:50% align:center
I never saw him
look so cold before.

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:28.243 position:50% align:center
I was scared he'd
do something bad.

00:14:28.326 --> 00:14:31.329 position:50% align:center
We made plans to go to
Ikebukuro for Christmas.

00:14:31.413 --> 00:14:32.580 position:50% align:center
Figured he was there.

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:49.764 position:50% align:center
When the hospital staff
confirmed his death,

00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:54.144 position:50% align:center
I was shocked and incredibly
relieved at the same time.

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:55.812 position:50% align:center
I remember thinking to myself,

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:59.524 position:50% align:center
at least he won't be able to lay
a hand on my dear Kouji anymore.

00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:09.951 position:50% align:center
[MISAKO] Um, Harumi,
about the other day...

00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:11.453 position:50% align:center
Oh, Misako!

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:13.163 position:50% align:center
Thanks for you-know-what.

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:15.749 position:50% align:center
Anyway, who's this
young man, is he family?

00:15:15.832 --> 00:15:17.584 position:50% align:center
No, not quite.

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:20.962 position:50% align:center
This guy's actually a friendly
acquaintance of Grandpa Nanjou.

00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:22.172 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:27.135 position:50% align:center
Harumi, when you discovered
Toshi's body back then,

00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:29.471 position:50% align:center
you said you found him
lying on the ground.

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
Is that it?

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:32.140 position:50% align:center
Did you see anything else?

00:15:32.223 --> 00:15:34.100 position:50% align:center
No. Don't think I did.

00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:36.061 position:50% align:center
It was so long ago,
I've forgotten by now.

00:15:38.063 --> 00:15:40.690 position:50% align:center
Listen, I think we're done here.

00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:43.860 position:50% align:center
You've got a good picture
of who Toshi was.

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.111 position:50% align:center
And Misako?

00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:46.905 position:50% align:center
I gotta go, I'm swamped.

00:15:58.249 --> 00:15:59.417 position:50% align:center
What's this about?

00:15:59.501 --> 00:16:00.794 position:50% align:center
If you wanna grab
a drink tonight,

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:02.504 position:50% align:center
then I'm gonna stop
you right there,

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:04.422 position:50% align:center
because I'm about to meet
up with the hottest intern

00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:06.007 position:50% align:center
you've ever seen.

00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:07.509 position:50% align:center
Actually, would you
mind holding off

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:09.260 position:50% align:center
for another five minutes?

00:16:09.344 --> 00:16:11.137 position:50% align:center
I need you to check a case
file that should be

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:12.430 position:50% align:center
in the archives.

00:16:12.514 --> 00:16:13.890 position:50% align:center
Which case?

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:15.558 position:50% align:center
It's a five-year-old
murder that went down

00:16:15.642 --> 00:16:17.519 position:50% align:center
behind the Met.

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:20.605 position:50% align:center
Find the testimony
from the first witness.

00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:23.358 position:50% align:center
You sure love poking your nose
into the nastiest business,

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:24.901 position:50% align:center
don't you?

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:26.820 position:50% align:center
Fine then.
Just give me a minute.

00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:30.407 position:50% align:center
[REIICHIROU]
Listen.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.909 position:50% align:center
You owe me one for this, okay?

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:36.121 position:50% align:center
Thanks to you I'll be 15
minutes late for my date.

00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:37.330 position:50% align:center
My bad.

00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:39.290 position:50% align:center
Next time, I'll treat you.

00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:40.709 position:50% align:center
You sound off.

00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:42.585 position:50% align:center
Is something the matter, buddy?

00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:49.634 position:50% align:center
[REIICHIROU] Ah, first one
there was Harumi Ueda.

00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:52.345 position:50% align:center
A 21-year-old housewife.

00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:54.097 position:50% align:center
She said that when she
found the victim lying

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.349 position:50% align:center
on the stairs
behind the theater,

00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:59.602 position:50% align:center
she saw a young couple who
tried to flee the scene.

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:03.231 position:50% align:center
The man was about
175 centimeters tall.

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:06.067 position:50% align:center
The woman was close behind
at around 170.

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:08.862 position:50% align:center
That's all I have.

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:11.614 position:50% align:center
So, were you able to discover
any relevant information

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:13.199 position:50% align:center
linked to the killer?

00:17:13.283 --> 00:17:14.868 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
No, never mind.

00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:17.203 position:50% align:center
Guess I was barking
up the wrong tree.

00:17:17.287 --> 00:17:19.956 position:50% align:center
Go on and enjoy
your night. See ya.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.291 position:50% align:center
What? Hey--

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:30.717 position:50% align:center
[HARUMI]
Makoto?

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.262 position:50% align:center
Heads up. I'm meeting
with Nanjou next week.

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:35.889 position:50% align:center
What'll you say?

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:37.891 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
No need to worry.

00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:40.060 position:50% align:center
I'll wrap things up in a way
that won't do too much

00:17:40.143 --> 00:17:41.603 position:50% align:center
long-term damage.

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:43.229 position:50% align:center
He's Akihiro's grandpa.

00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:45.398 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure it continues
to stay that way.

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:48.651 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it.

00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:50.820 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] When it's New Year's,
I'll send some fruit

00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
from my shop.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.281 position:50% align:center
Later.

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:09.255 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:11.633 position:50% align:center
You've honestly done
so much for me.

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:14.177 position:50% align:center
There isn't that much
to thank me for.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.429 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid the only thing I have
to show for my efforts

00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:19.140 position:50% align:center
up to this point is
my busted up mug.

00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:21.017 position:50% align:center
To be completely honest,

00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
I've heard a number of
unsavory rumors about my son.

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:26.439 position:50% align:center
But all of that doesn't matter.

00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:27.857 position:50% align:center
I have faith in you.

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:29.693 position:50% align:center
You'll bring the truth
to light soon!

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:32.821 position:50% align:center
[MISAKO]
Excuse us!

00:18:36.783 --> 00:18:38.868 position:50% align:center
My name's Misako Matsuoka.

00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:44.749 position:50% align:center
You don't know me.

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:47.377 position:50% align:center
But I'm the one who was
responsible for your son's death

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.670 position:50% align:center
five years ago.

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:50.005 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:57.721 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry, but I
just don't understand.

00:18:57.804 --> 00:19:00.056 position:50% align:center
Please, I want to know
everything that happened.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.102 position:50% align:center
That was the night I told
Toshi that I was ending

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:05.645 position:50% align:center
our relationship.

00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:08.231 position:50% align:center
You see, I wanted to tell you.

00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:11.276 position:50% align:center
But I was too
ashamed to admit it.

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:14.154 position:50% align:center
He beat me behind closed doors.

00:19:14.237 --> 00:19:18.908 position:50% align:center
Not a day went by that I didn't
have a bruise on my body.

00:19:18.992 --> 00:19:23.538 position:50% align:center
Even so, I couldn't
bring myself to leave him,

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:25.874 position:50% align:center
but then I met my true love.

00:19:28.126 --> 00:19:29.878 position:50% align:center
[YASUHIRO]
Do you mean Kouji?

00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:33.757 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:19:37.552 --> 00:19:39.012 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:40.555 position:50% align:center
Then please forgive me.

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:43.433 position:50% align:center
My idiot son did the
unspeakable after all.

00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:47.312 position:50% align:center
Then that means...

00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:49.689 position:50% align:center
Toshi isn't Akihiro's
father, is he?

00:19:49.773 --> 00:19:52.359 position:50% align:center
[HARUMI crying]

00:19:57.155 --> 00:19:58.448 position:50% align:center
I get it.

00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:02.035 position:50% align:center
That perfect child was never
actually related to me.

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:04.120 position:50% align:center
It makes sense.

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:05.455 position:50% align:center
I'm such a fool.

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:10.043 position:50% align:center
Go on, ma'am.

00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:11.711 position:50% align:center
Please tell me why you did it.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.798 position:50% align:center
Well, uh, it was back
when my husband and I

00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:17.008 position:50% align:center
were only engaged.

00:20:17.092 --> 00:20:18.760 position:50% align:center
We were on our way
home from a date

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:23.014 position:50% align:center
when my husband bumped into
a man who was rushing past.

00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:25.850 position:50% align:center
Before we even knew it,
he'd thrown a punch.

00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:28.687 position:50% align:center
I tried my best
to stop your son,

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.397 position:50% align:center
but he kept pushing me away.

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:37.737 position:50% align:center
I had no intention
of hurting him.

00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:40.407 position:50% align:center
No, I just wanted to
get that man away

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.075 position:50% align:center
from my poor husband.

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:44.244 position:50% align:center
I can't tell you how
many times I've almost

00:20:44.327 --> 00:20:45.537 position:50% align:center
turned myself in.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.288 position:50% align:center
But then, my husband
and I decided we should

00:20:47.372 --> 00:20:49.749 position:50% align:center
get married, and...

00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:52.669 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry. I truly am.

00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:56.006 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for not giving you
a proper apology sooner.

00:20:56.089 --> 00:20:57.340 position:50% align:center
For five years.

00:20:57.424 --> 00:20:59.009 position:50% align:center
It's beyond unforgivable!

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.304 position:50% align:center
[MISAKO'S HUSBAND] We know
it's selfish to even ask this.

00:21:03.388 --> 00:21:07.100 position:50% align:center
But our baby's supposed to
arrive in the next month.

00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:08.435 position:50% align:center
So please.

00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:10.979 position:50% align:center
If you could just give us
a little bit more time.

00:21:11.062 --> 00:21:13.398 position:50% align:center
After that,
we'll go to the police.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.028 position:50% align:center
[YASUHIRO]
It's Matsuoka, right?

00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:21.239 position:50% align:center
Tell me, are your parents
still alive and well?

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:22.532 position:50% align:center
[MISAKO'S HUSBAND]
Uh, yes.

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:24.034 position:50% align:center
[MISAKO]
Yes.

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:26.202 position:50% align:center
[YASUHIRO]
See, that's the thing.

00:21:26.286 --> 00:21:28.788 position:50% align:center
We can't have a mother
behind bars, can we?

00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:31.207 position:50% align:center
Especially when her
baby's on the way.

00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:32.292 position:50% align:center
Dammit.

00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:38.673 position:50% align:center
Toshihiro. I'm sorry for
being a terrible father.

00:21:38.757 --> 00:21:39.966 position:50% align:center
In the end I--

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.218 position:50% align:center
I couldn't give you the life
that you deserved,

00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:45.847 position:50% align:center
let alone achieve
justice for your death.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.391 position:50% align:center
Someday I'll apologize
man to man.

00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:51.936 position:50% align:center
In the meantime, you just
sit tight and rest in peace.

00:22:01.321 --> 00:22:03.073 position:50% align:center
It's finally over.

00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:04.699 position:50% align:center
And it all ended for the best.

00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:09.954 position:50% align:center
You know, Pops,
if you were my father...

00:22:12.248 --> 00:22:13.667 position:50% align:center
...I'd be pretty
damn proud of you.
