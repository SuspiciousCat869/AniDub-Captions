00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.723 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] When video sharing
sites first became a thing,

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:16.975 position:50% align:center
they were small and irrelevant.

00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:20.937 position:50% align:center
Like mice darting under
the feet of dinosaurs.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:24.274 position:50% align:center
It was all about news,
books, and TV.

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:28.486 position:50% align:center
Today, the old gods
are slowly going extinct.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.238 position:50% align:center
The mice are just fine.

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:32.907 position:50% align:center
They've evolved into
giants themselves.

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:34.951 position:50% align:center
But no matter how big you get,

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.620 position:50% align:center
the fight to survive
is still a rat race.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.414 position:50% align:center
Another day, another game.

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:43.168 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:45.670 position:50% align:center
Did you know the Red Angels
have their own channel too?

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:47.047 position:50% align:center
Look here!

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.549 position:50% align:center
And people actually
make a living this way?

00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:50.717 position:50% align:center
[ZERO-ONE]
Of course.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.094 position:50% align:center
It's much more than
just a silly hobby.

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:55.055 position:50% align:center
When schools ask their
students what they wanna be

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:56.681 position:50% align:center
when they grow up now,

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:59.267 position:50% align:center
pro content creator is
always high on the list.

00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:01.561 position:50% align:center
No way that pulling
stunts is a real career.

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:39.659 position:50% align:center
[ZERO-ONE] There are a lot of
vid sites where you can earn

00:02:39.743 --> 00:02:42.078 position:50% align:center
a high payout, but the
most popular platform

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.998 position:50% align:center
as of late is called ZettaMovie.

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:48.668 position:50% align:center
Once you sign up, you then
become a ZettaMovier.

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:51.546 position:50% align:center
Which means each time
your video gets watched,

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.590 position:50% align:center
you make a bit of cash.

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:56.134 position:50% align:center
Okay, how much are
we talking per view?

00:02:56.217 --> 00:02:58.261 position:50% align:center
[ZERO-ONE]
Depends on your channel reps.

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:00.722 position:50% align:center
The average rate has
gone down a little lately.

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:03.808 position:50% align:center
But still, if a single view
gives you .1 yen,

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:06.311 position:50% align:center
then a million means
a hundred thousand.

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:09.898 position:50% align:center
So, why're you interested
in this suddenly, Makoto?

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:12.984 position:50% align:center
Are you thinking about
promoting Kyouichi Ozaki?

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:15.695 position:50% align:center
No. I have a
request from Takashi.

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:17.072 position:50% align:center
It's G-Boys stuff.

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:18.490 position:50% align:center
Turns out one of those
internet celebs

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:20.492 position:50% align:center
is wanting to hire a bodyguard.

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:23.578 position:50% align:center
I'm supposed to look into what
this guy is all about for him.

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:24.829 position:50% align:center
That's interesting.

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:26.664 position:50% align:center
I didn't know you guys
were watchdogs.

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:29.668 position:50% align:center
Oh, and this joker
decided to tag along with me.

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:31.127 position:50% align:center
I get to meet all kinds
of new people

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:33.171 position:50% align:center
when I'm hanging with Makoto.

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
And it's fun, so I've
been tailing the guy

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.341 position:50% align:center
as much as I can.

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:38.843 position:50% align:center
You found yourself
a little brother, huh?

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.470 position:50% align:center
Don't get any ideas.

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:42.138 position:50% align:center
I figured it couldn't hurt
to keep the Red Angel's

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.015 position:50% align:center
number two with me.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.225 position:50% align:center
It's strictly business.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.894 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna head out.

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:49.646 position:50% align:center
You helped me,
so I'll take care of this.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:53.733 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI]
It's Ryuusei140.

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:56.152 position:50% align:center
I'm the guy you're protecting.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.987 position:50% align:center
Though something tells me
you don't know your

00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:59.489 position:50% align:center
content creators.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:00.699 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Nah.

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:02.075 position:50% align:center
I've got a couple of
friends, but none of 'em

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:03.785 position:50% align:center
are ZettaMoviers.

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:06.788 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI]
Well, lemme introduce myself.

00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:09.833 position:50% align:center
Yo, it's Ryuusei140!

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.126 position:50% align:center
Whoo!

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:15.005 position:50% align:center
Clock your shooting star!

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.798 position:50% align:center
I'm here at West Gate Park.

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:19.801 position:50% align:center
The perfect spot for
this week's Onion Fun.

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:22.846 position:50% align:center
You ready?
Showtime begins, now!

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.190 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI grunts]

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.151 position:50% align:center
A minute and 46, eh?

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:38.486 position:50% align:center
That's four seconds slower
than last week!

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.989 position:50% align:center
Now this is something
you should try at home.

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:42.490 position:50% align:center
It's a gamechanger
for your health,

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:45.285 position:50% align:center
'specially your blood
flow. Bye-bye.

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:47.871 position:50% align:center
Sweet.

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:51.374 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
It's huge!

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:52.917 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI]
Pipe down, would ya?

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:58.089 position:50% align:center
Welcome to my humble
abode and video factory.

00:04:58.173 --> 00:04:59.799 position:50% align:center
Those two are my
production team.

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.761 position:50% align:center
Gong Saitou and Cheadle Yokoi.

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
The channel has 1.2
million subscribers.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:08.975 position:50% align:center
Onion Fun's a pretty
popular series.

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:10.894 position:50% align:center
My fans can't get enough of it.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:12.228 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.064 position:50% align:center
Check out the one I just made.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.441 position:50% align:center
I've already earned about
32 thousand yen.

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.694 position:50% align:center
That's cool.

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:22.197 position:50% align:center
Anyway, why'd you wanna hire
the G-Boys for security?

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
Because of these guys.

00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:38.672 position:50% align:center
[whooping]

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:42.217 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI] They're called
ToDaBaShi Destroyer Z,

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.886 position:50% align:center
and their gimmick
is vandalizing stuff.

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.971 position:50% align:center
They're also known for
making diss tracks

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:48.890 position:50% align:center
about other creators.

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:51.559 position:50% align:center
[Z1]
Log off, 140! Man, you stank!

00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:54.187 position:50% align:center

doing really stupid pranks!

[Z4] Keep shovin' those onions
in your face until you cry cry!

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.444 position:50% align:center
So, wait, these guys
are rapping about you?

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.863 position:50% align:center
Best response woulda
been to let it go.

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:05.824 position:50% align:center
But of course, I had
to fire back at them.

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:07.617 position:50% align:center
You spittin' hate while
I'm out here livin'.

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:10.245 position:50% align:center
Why do you gorillas
keep negativin'.

00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:13.081 position:50% align:center
You think you're witty, but
your rhymes stay shitty!

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:14.541 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Nice comeback.

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:15.959 position:50% align:center
Well, they got angry.

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.544 position:50% align:center
And that's not all.

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:20.922 position:50% align:center
In four days, it's gonna be my
channel's five-year anniversary.

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:22.841 position:50% align:center
So, they sent me this.

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:25.969 position:50% align:center
[Z1] Here's an official present
from us to the onion whore.

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:27.804 position:50% align:center
Congratulations, loser!

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:31.808 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:34.477 position:50% align:center
Careful. Wouldn't want
this to happen to you!

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:39.149 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI] That made their
numbers go through the roof.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:42.027 position:50% align:center
I feel like they're about
to try something worse.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.236 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.738 position:50% align:center
You're saying you want
people to keep you safe

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:46.114 position:50% align:center
in case they jump you.

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:47.240 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI]
Yep.

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:49.284 position:50% align:center
I need backup for the big event.

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:53.079 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd film the finale
to one of my most viral bits.

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:56.541 position:50% align:center
Shimmy shimmy cocoa pop,
Shimmy shimmy cocoa pop!

Toss the Human Die
till the numbers stop!

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:08.970 position:50% align:center
Cha-ching.

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:12.265 position:50% align:center
If you picked four,
it's your lucky day.

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:13.350 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:16.936 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.
I don't think I get the joke.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.396 position:50% align:center
There is no joke.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.066 position:50% align:center
It's absurd, but it's funny,
and that's what matters.

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:24.486 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I was planning
to shoot it over here.

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.821 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Wait, that's the Tokyo Met!

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:29.282 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI] Everyone'll
talk about it for sure.

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:32.827 position:50% align:center
And besides, I get injured,
then it'll be totally cool.

00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:34.496 position:50% align:center
I can post rehab vids!

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:35.789 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Sure...

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:38.416 position:50% align:center
Look, pal, I'll be a
sitting duck for a while.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.919 position:50% align:center
Please ask the G-Boys
to guard me from danger.

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:42.754 position:50% align:center
Help me!

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:45.840 position:50% align:center
Danger?
You risk your life every day

00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:48.134 position:50% align:center
just so people will click
on your newest videos.

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:49.302 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI]
You betcha.

00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:51.846 position:50% align:center
Even if they're
silly or pointless.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.057 position:50% align:center
There are thousands of
people out there who love

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.892 position:50% align:center
everything that I'm doing.

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:58.186 position:50% align:center
And I wouldn't give it up
for anything in the world!

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:00.397 position:50% align:center
Books, magazines, TV.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.441 position:50% align:center
They can depict a single,
contained universe.

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:05.443 position:50% align:center
A perfectly cohesive story.

00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:07.612 position:50% align:center
One consistent
from start to finish.

00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:09.030 position:50% align:center
But on the internet,

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:11.408 position:50% align:center
you don't need to worry about
everything making sense

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:14.119 position:50% align:center
because it's just a
brief snapshot of life.

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:16.287 position:50% align:center
Nope.
No scripts here, bro.

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:19.082 position:50% align:center
It's about embracing the chaos
and rejecting the polished

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:22.043 position:50% align:center
pretense of programming
for the real nitty-gritty!

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:26.506 position:50% align:center
A fleeting, fragmentary,
livestream of love.

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:30.176 position:50% align:center
The entire world is
going digital, baby!

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.804 position:50% align:center
It's the dawn of a new age,
and it's unfolding

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:34.889 position:50% align:center
before our very eyes.

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:39.185 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Okay. Me and the
G-Boys'll cover your back.

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:40.395 position:50% align:center
Thanks, bro.

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:42.105 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure to pay
you guys well!

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:44.899 position:50% align:center
You can hash out the finer
details with Takashi.

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:47.193 position:50% align:center
I'm working pro bono for you.

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:49.154 position:50% align:center
Just give me a moment, okay?

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:50.655 position:50% align:center
You're volunteering?

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:53.033 position:50% align:center
Man, you're a bit of a weirdo.

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:54.951 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, it takes
one to know one.

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:56.036 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI chuckles]

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:00.081 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
We should accept the gig.

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:02.167 position:50% align:center
[sighs] What can I say?

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.961 position:50% align:center
He's an interesting figure,
and he takes his work

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:08.506 position:50% align:center
more seriously than most,
there's no doubt about that.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.675 position:50% align:center
Makes you wanna root for him.

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.886 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,
it's settled.

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:14.971 position:50% align:center
I'll have my men
make preparations.

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:17.390 position:50% align:center
They can serve
as his guard detail.

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:20.310 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] I'll stick close to
Ryuusei in the meantime.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:22.145 position:50% align:center
He and I are alike in many ways.

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:24.230 position:50% align:center
Both of us take pride
in what we do.

00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:28.777 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI]
Be sure to like and subscribe!

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:31.571 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's going on?

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:32.572 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
Heads up.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:34.699 position:50% align:center
You've got company watching you.

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:35.867 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
You're kidding.

00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:39.412 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI] There's a vehicle
outside the apartment.

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:41.247 position:50% align:center
They might be looking
for a chance to attack.

00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:45.960 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] I definitely don't want
this to turn into a brawl.

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:47.379 position:50% align:center
Besides, who knows.

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:51.216 position:50% align:center
Could be someone other
than ToDaBaShi, right?

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:52.384 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
That's true.

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:53.551 position:50% align:center
For now,

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:55.720 position:50% align:center
let's just keep an
eye out on that car.

00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:57.180 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
Copy.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:58.515 position:50% align:center
That's incredible!

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:01.976 position:50% align:center
You've already caught them!
You guys are pros!

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.436 position:50% align:center
C'mere! [grunts]

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.979 position:50% align:center
Easy there, tough guy.

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:06.606 position:50% align:center
What're you so excited about?

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.316 position:50% align:center
You're the one being
targeted, remember?

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.027 position:50% align:center
But if I get a good shot,
I can expose them.

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:13.988 position:50% align:center
It's my chance to get the
upper hand on Destroyer Z.

00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:15.448 position:50% align:center
Our channels are neck
and neck when it comes

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:16.616 position:50% align:center
to subscribers.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.952 position:50% align:center
But that won't be
the case for long.

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:20.036 position:50% align:center
Forget it, dude.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.329 position:50% align:center
Once they see you're
watching them,

00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:23.998 position:50% align:center
they'll run away,
so calm down, would ya?

00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:26.292 position:50% align:center
You're not wrong,
but it's a perfect photo op!

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:27.919 position:50% align:center
Listen up, okay?

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:30.380 position:50% align:center
When the G-Boys tail somebody,
we're talking at least

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:32.841 position:50% align:center
20-odd people
waiting on standby.

00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:35.093 position:50% align:center
Just a little longer, and
they'll have made a perimeter

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:37.554 position:50% align:center
around this entire building.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:40.098 position:50% align:center
I see. They aren't joking, huh?

00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:42.267 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] When Takashi gives an
order, members everywhere

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.394 position:50% align:center
start mobilizing immediately.

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:46.855 position:50% align:center
Now that you have the
help of Ikebukuro's King,

00:10:46.938 --> 00:10:49.816 position:50% align:center
you'd best leave
things up to him.

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.276 position:50% align:center
Fine, I hear you.

00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:55.447 position:50% align:center
Gotta go potty.

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:02.912 position:50% align:center
So, tell me about
yourself, Saitou.

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:04.164 position:50% align:center
You look pretty athletic.

00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:06.082 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing you hit
the weights often.

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:08.585 position:50% align:center
I used to practice martial
arts on the regular.

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.420 position:50% align:center
These days, I'm just a fan.

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:13.340 position:50% align:center
I help Ryuusei
plan physical gags,

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:16.343 position:50% align:center
and I do all the heavy lifting
for him too, of course.

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:17.886 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
And you, Yokoi?

00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:20.055 position:50% align:center
What kind of hobbies
are you into?

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:22.766 position:50% align:center
I'm kinda obsessed with
the underground idol scene.

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:26.770 position:50% align:center
So yeah, I choreograph
his song and dance ideas.

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:28.646 position:50% align:center
Also, meet my bias.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.065 position:50% align:center
[GONG laughs]
Ain't he funny?

00:11:30.148 --> 00:11:31.566 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO chuckles]

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:34.736 position:50% align:center
It seems your boss keeps a
level head, wouldn't you say?

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:36.863 position:50% align:center
Can you tell me what
it's like working for him?

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:38.406 position:50% align:center
[CHEADLE]
To be honest with you,

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.158 position:50% align:center
and it's not just here,

00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:42.452 position:50% align:center
but a larger issue
with the industry.

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.954 position:50% align:center
Whoa, you're really
going to tell him, huh?

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:50.919 position:50% align:center
Lately, the rules about gonzo
vids are getting stricter.

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:53.630 position:50% align:center
I think Onion Fun
will prob'ly be fine.

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.423 position:50% align:center
But falling down the stairs?

00:11:55.507 --> 00:11:57.384 position:50% align:center
That might be on the way out.

00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:59.260 position:50% align:center
Plus, the pay's dropped.

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:02.764 position:50% align:center
Huh. A friend of mine mentioned
something about that.

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:04.224 position:50% align:center
In any case,

00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:06.726 position:50% align:center
that's why I think we've got
pretty tough times ahead.

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:10.271 position:50% align:center
Acting a fool won't be
enough to keep us afloat.

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:12.816 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI] That last onion
did a number on me.

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:13.983 position:50% align:center
Talk about messy!

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:17.987 position:50% align:center
Takashi. What's going on?

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:21.032 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
Bad news. They saw us and split.

00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:25.286 position:50% align:center
We still hadn't
secured the perimeter.

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:29.958 position:50% align:center
It's not easy to
give us the slip.

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:32.711 position:50% align:center
Guess they're sharper
than we thought.

00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:34.129 position:50% align:center
Roger that.

00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:35.839 position:50% align:center
We can try again tomorrow night.

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:38.466 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI]
What's the matter?

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.218 position:50% align:center
They got away. Sorry.

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.388 position:50% align:center
Maybe I should have
been keeping watch, too.

00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:47.684 position:50% align:center
No worries, though.

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:49.978 position:50% align:center
As long as we're here
then you'll be fine.

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:52.105 position:50% align:center
Keep working on that
5th anniversary video.

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:53.481 position:50% align:center
I wanna see it, too, all right?

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.652 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah, totally.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.449 position:50% align:center
[GONG]
Majima!

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:03.700 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
What's wrong?

00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:05.994 position:50% align:center
[GONG]
It's his car!

00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:14.461 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI gasping]

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:23.178 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
They knocked out our guys?

00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:25.180 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
According to the updated report,

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:28.266 position:50% align:center
there were two men stationed
near the apartment complex,

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.935 position:50% align:center
and they had to be
sent to the hospital.

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:33.313 position:50% align:center
I'd bet good money that it was
those ToDaBaShi Destroyer

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:34.814 position:50% align:center
Z punks.

00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:36.274 position:50% align:center
Let's stay on the lookout.

00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
Gotcha.

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:40.445 position:50% align:center
This situation
just got personal.

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:42.530 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIOKA]
Something's peculiar here.

00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:44.824 position:50% align:center
Even though this
kid's van got totaled,

00:13:44.908 --> 00:13:46.910 position:50% align:center
he went straight for the camera.

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:48.995 position:50% align:center
We asked the victim
to stop filming,

00:13:49.079 --> 00:13:50.872 position:50% align:center
but he won't cooperate.

00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:53.291 position:50% align:center
Funny. Wonder what his deal is.

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:58.630 position:50% align:center
[ZERO-ONE]
No new uploads yet.

00:13:58.713 --> 00:14:00.799 position:50% align:center
Even those idiots know they'd
be fessing up to the crime

00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:03.635 position:50% align:center
if they posted anything
suspect about his ride.

00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:07.430 position:50% align:center
And meanwhile, the sob story
that your new client put out?

00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:10.141 position:50% align:center
It's already got
half a million views.

00:14:10.225 --> 00:14:12.102 position:50% align:center
The comments section
is on fire with hate

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:14.437 position:50% align:center
for ToDaBaShi Destroyer Z.

00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:16.064 position:50% align:center
Oh, hold on.

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:17.315 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:19.776 position:50% align:center
[ZERO-ONE] The vandals
just released an update.

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:22.362 position:50% align:center
[Z1] Yo, you're just a
big dumb onion ho!

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:23.530 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Onion ho!

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:25.407 position:50% align:center
[Z2] And you're gonna
reap what you sow!

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:26.950 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
That's right!

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:29.119 position:50% align:center
[Z3] First you lose your car,
then you'll get a big scar!

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:32.038 position:50% align:center
[Z4]
You'll get a big scar!

00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:34.124 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
You'll get a big scar!

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:35.625 position:50% align:center
[ZERO-ONE] They don't
technically say that they

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:36.710 position:50% align:center
did it.

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:39.337 position:50% align:center
But the viewers
won't stop replying.

00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:40.588 position:50% align:center
[ZERO-ONE sighs]

00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:42.340 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:14:42.424 --> 00:14:43.425 position:50% align:center
So that's it.

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:45.093 position:50% align:center
You find something else?

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:47.095 position:50% align:center
[ZERO-ONE]
I'm just thinking out loud.

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:48.930 position:50% align:center
You should talk
to that Saitou guy.

00:14:49.014 --> 00:14:50.306 position:50% align:center
Fish for details.

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI]
The comments are divided.

00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:56.938 position:50% align:center
Half of them support us,
half support ToDaBaShi.

00:14:58.857 --> 00:14:59.899 position:50% align:center
Saito.

00:14:59.983 --> 00:15:01.693 position:50% align:center
You've been extremely
quiet today.

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:03.486 position:50% align:center
It seems like you've got
something on your mind.

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:07.115 position:50% align:center
If there's something
you wanna say, I'll listen.

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:08.783 position:50% align:center
Meet me by West Gate Park.

00:15:08.867 --> 00:15:10.869 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI] Something that'll get
everyone's blood pumping.

00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:12.495 position:50% align:center
It'll be a huge hit!

00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:18.168 position:50% align:center
[GONG] So they're downsizing,
and I'm being let go.

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:20.170 position:50% align:center
They only told me last night.

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:23.548 position:50% align:center
I do a good job, and I get
along with everybody, but...

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:25.884 position:50% align:center
...they have to cut expenses.

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:27.344 position:50% align:center
Ryuusei makes bank.

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:29.637 position:50% align:center
Why can't he afford to keep you?

00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:31.473 position:50% align:center
[GONG]
Content revenue's too low.

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:33.183 position:50% align:center
Creators are hurting.

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:35.310 position:50% align:center
Money's getting tight
for the studio.

00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:36.603 position:50% align:center
It's an issue.

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:38.396 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Is that it?

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.274 position:50% align:center
I get the sense you're not
telling me something big.

00:15:41.358 --> 00:15:42.859 position:50% align:center
Ryuusei can't fire you twice.

00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:47.405 position:50% align:center
This war between the
channels is nothing more

00:15:47.489 --> 00:15:49.616 position:50% align:center
than TV wrestling.

00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:50.742 position:50% align:center
It's all fake!

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:51.826 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:53.078 --> 00:15:54.871 position:50% align:center
They scripted the
whole thing out,

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:57.665 position:50% align:center
and both of them now are
just following the plan.

00:15:57.749 --> 00:16:01.127 position:50% align:center
ToDaBaShi plays the heel,
Ryuusei plays the good guy,

00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:03.421 position:50% align:center
but in reality they're working
together to rile viewers up

00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:04.839 position:50% align:center
so they can generate clicks!

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.719 position:50% align:center
So they've been working
together behind the scenes.

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:11.554 position:50% align:center
[GONG] They only diss each
other to gain fake clout

00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:13.348 position:50% align:center
and draw numbers.

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:14.891 position:50% align:center
The car getting trashed?

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:16.434 position:50% align:center
That incident was staged!

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:21.856 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] ToDaBaShi knew they
were being watched.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.901 position:50% align:center
Because Ryuusei texted
them from the bathroom.

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:26.528 position:50% align:center
Which means...

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:28.530 position:50% align:center
...me and Takashi
were just pawns.

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:31.449 position:50% align:center
[GONG]
Involving the G-Boys--

00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:33.618 position:50% align:center
That was guaranteed exposure.

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:35.620 position:50% align:center
Still...

00:16:35.704 --> 00:16:38.790 position:50% align:center
I can't believe he had money
to pay off everyone else.

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:41.459 position:50% align:center
Except me. What a blow.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.219 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI]
What's up, bro?

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:53.013 position:50% align:center
So why did you
call me out here?

00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:58.601 position:50% align:center
I see, so you got
the honest truth.

00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:00.061 position:50% align:center
Did Gong tell you?

00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:01.688 position:50% align:center
No surprise there.

00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:03.023 position:50% align:center
You should've been
completely transparent

00:17:03.106 --> 00:17:05.275 position:50% align:center
from our very first meeting.

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:06.943 position:50% align:center
If you were real with us,

00:17:07.027 --> 00:17:09.446 position:50% align:center
we could've gone
about this differently.

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:11.031 position:50% align:center
I swindled you.

00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:12.907 position:50% align:center
I feel really bad.

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:15.994 position:50% align:center
I mean, you were serious
about helping me.

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:19.164 position:50% align:center
Who cares about me?
Worry about Takashi.

00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:21.291 position:50% align:center
Crossing him was a big mistake.

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:22.917 position:50% align:center
His men were hurt.

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:24.294 position:50% align:center
He won't let this go.

00:17:25.837 --> 00:17:27.005 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:17:29.132 --> 00:17:32.135 position:50% align:center
I never wanted actual
violence to happen!

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:34.512 position:50% align:center
You gotta believe me!

00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:37.515 position:50% align:center
That's nice, but you should save
your pleading for Takashi.

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:39.684 position:50% align:center
You've heard the rumors, right?

00:17:39.768 --> 00:17:42.187 position:50% align:center
Anyone who pisses him
off isn't ever seen again.

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:45.357 position:50% align:center
Later.

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:54.783 position:50% align:center
--Makoto!
--[MAKOTO groans]

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:57.744 position:50% align:center
--[MAKOTO] A falling-out?
--Yeah.

00:17:57.827 --> 00:18:00.372 position:50% align:center
They were haggling over how
much they should be paid.

00:18:00.455 --> 00:18:02.916 position:50% align:center
ToDaBaShi is angry
for real this time!

00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:05.001 position:50% align:center
Sounds like another lie to me.

00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:08.213 position:50% align:center
I'm dead serious, and
tomorrow the human die shoot

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:11.049 position:50% align:center
is gonna happen even
though it's beyond risky.

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:13.802 position:50% align:center
Obviously, you're not
obligated to help us anymore,

00:18:13.885 --> 00:18:16.012 position:50% align:center
but please, could you find it
in your heart somewhere

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:17.430 position:50% align:center
to save Ryuusei?

00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:28.983 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI]
You came!

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:30.485 position:50% align:center
I figured, why not?

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.904 position:50% align:center
I might as well see this
all the way through.

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:35.115 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI]
Uh, thanks a lot.

00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:37.826 position:50% align:center
Not gonna lie though,
this could get ugly.

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:40.912 position:50% align:center
There's serious tension
between me and those gorillas.

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:42.330 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Fine by me.

00:18:42.414 --> 00:18:43.832 position:50% align:center
I'm used to this kinda thing.

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:47.711 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Five years, here we go!

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:51.506 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Sure is tall.

00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:53.258 position:50% align:center
You sure that you're
gonna be okay?

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:54.467 position:50% align:center
Leave it to me.

00:18:54.551 --> 00:18:57.012 position:50% align:center
Falling down stairs is my forte.

00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:58.596 position:50% align:center
We don't have any permits.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.057 position:50% align:center
So once we're at
the top, I'm diving.

00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:02.851 position:50% align:center
[CHEADLE]
And I'll film you from below.

00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:04.728 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI] As soon as
we're done, we're out.

00:19:06.521 --> 00:19:09.107 position:50% align:center
Thanks for comin' along.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:12.152 position:50% align:center
I figured you'd abandon
me, but you're here.

00:19:12.235 --> 00:19:15.447 position:50% align:center
Yokoi's the one you should
be thanking, not me.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.825 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to see the
beginning of that brand new age.

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:20.285 position:50% align:center
It sounded cool.

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:24.330 position:50% align:center
--[CHEADLE] Watch out!
--[Z3 grunts]

00:19:24.414 --> 00:19:26.332 position:50% align:center
[Z1]
There you are, cheapskate!

00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:28.126 position:50% align:center
[Z2]
Time to kick your ass!

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:29.169 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI gasps]

00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:30.670 position:50% align:center
[Z4]
No more games, bro!

00:19:30.754 --> 00:19:31.880 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
Hold it.

00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:40.513 position:50% align:center
[G-BOYS yelling]

00:19:40.597 --> 00:19:42.557 position:50% align:center
[Z1 gasps]

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:53.109 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI] Tell me, you've
heard of the Hammer Brothers,

00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:54.235 position:50% align:center
haven't you?

00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:55.945 position:50% align:center
Uh, I haven't, why?

00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:57.072 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:20:02.744 --> 00:20:04.871 position:50% align:center
[Z1 gasps]

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:10.293 position:50% align:center
This is the price you pay
for laying your hands

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:11.753 position:50% align:center
on my people.

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:12.962 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Dude, that's enough!

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:14.547 position:50% align:center
He's just a kid, all right?

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:18.051 position:50% align:center
--So, what now?
--[TAKASHI] Ryuusei.

00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:19.969 position:50% align:center
You and I have some
unsettled business over

00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:21.971 position:50% align:center
that little trick
you pulled before.

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:24.849 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI gasps]
Forgive me, sir!

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:28.353 position:50% align:center
Oh, please!
I'll do anything you want.

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:31.648 position:50% align:center
Just let me fall down
the stairs first!

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:34.401 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
C'mon. We might as well let him.

00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:37.862 position:50% align:center
Can't keep 1.2 million
subscribers waiting, can we?

00:20:37.946 --> 00:20:39.155 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI]
You mean it?

00:20:40.323 --> 00:20:41.491 position:50% align:center
Thank you, bro!

00:20:44.202 --> 00:20:45.578 position:50% align:center
Suit yourself.

00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:53.837 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI]
Let's fly to the future!

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.005 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:56.089 position:50% align:center
[TOMOMI]
Uh...

00:20:58.049 --> 00:21:00.760 position:50% align:center
Whoa. I would never
be able to do that.

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:03.388 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] You should've seen
him after we wrapped.

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:06.099 position:50% align:center
Poor guy broke almost
every bone he had.

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:08.393 position:50% align:center
We had to carry him
out and hail a cab.

00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:10.311 position:50% align:center
Went straight to the ER.

00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:12.313 position:50% align:center
And how exactly did
the G-Boys' King decide

00:21:12.397 --> 00:21:14.441 position:50% align:center
to punish the guilty idiot?

00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:16.860 position:50% align:center
He made him pay off
his accrued debt in full.

00:21:16.943 --> 00:21:19.154 position:50% align:center
Once that was covered,
then they were square.

00:21:19.237 --> 00:21:22.240 position:50% align:center
Also, Takashi gets access
to Ryuusei's studio

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:24.242 position:50% align:center
anytime he wants to use it.

00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:26.202 position:50% align:center
[ZERO-ONE]
Smart thinking there.

00:21:26.286 --> 00:21:28.788 position:50% align:center
Whatever future the
internet might bring us,

00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:31.666 position:50% align:center
the only way we can survive
is if we continue to adapt

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.002 position:50% align:center
and evolve with the
ever-changing norms.

00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:36.546 position:50% align:center
If you got time to complain,
you may as well learn

00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:38.757 position:50% align:center
to post a video.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.300 position:50% align:center
Wait, what about you?

00:21:40.383 --> 00:21:42.260 position:50% align:center
Do you make content?

00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:45.305 position:50% align:center
No way. I'm the type of
guy who prefers to watch.

00:21:45.388 --> 00:21:48.433 position:50% align:center
Anyway, you bring
what I asked you for?

00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:49.934 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:21:50.018 --> 00:21:51.603 position:50% align:center
It's the least I could do for
all the advice you gave me

00:21:51.686 --> 00:21:53.396 position:50% align:center
this time.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.607 position:50% align:center
[ZERO-ONE]
Fresh ramen from Nao.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.943 position:50% align:center
I've been wanting to try
this delicacy forever.

00:21:59.027 --> 00:22:00.987 position:50% align:center
Uh... is this allowed?

00:22:01.071 --> 00:22:03.198 position:50% align:center
Zero-One is a
beloved regular here.

00:22:03.281 --> 00:22:05.075 position:50% align:center
The staff lets him get
away with a few things.

00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:11.206 position:50% align:center
Well, maybe I should
try posting stuff too.

00:22:11.289 --> 00:22:12.499 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait!

00:22:12.582 --> 00:22:14.125 position:50% align:center
You should try eating
that with fruity sherbet

00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:15.794 position:50% align:center
piled on top of it.

00:22:15.877 --> 00:22:17.837 position:50% align:center
[ZERO-ONE] You can do
that with your own noods.

00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:19.214 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
I knew you'd say no!
