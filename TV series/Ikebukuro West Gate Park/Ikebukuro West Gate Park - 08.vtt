Heyo.

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:16.261 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Kyouichi? Isogai?

00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:17.512 position:50% align:center
What brings you here?

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:19.931 position:50% align:center
I've come by with a
request for Ikebukuro's

00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:22.183 position:50% align:center
resident troubleshooter.

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:23.518 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Huh?

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:24.602 position:50% align:center
[CAT meows]

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:42.412 position:50% align:center
A few days back, a toddler
fell off an apartment

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.330 position:50% align:center
balcony in Senkawa.

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:47.208 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I heard.

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:50.211 position:50% align:center
He's a kid being raised
by a single mother.

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:52.005 position:50% align:center
You should go see
how they're doing.

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:53.423 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:56.009 position:50% align:center
You see, the two of them
stop by our park all the time.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.188 position:50% align:center
The mom.

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:10.774 position:50% align:center
She watches Kyouichi dance,
while the boy plays nearby.

00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:15.153 position:50% align:center
But... last week,

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:17.280 position:50% align:center
she came alone.
No kid in sight.

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:21.910 position:50% align:center
"While his mother
was away by herself,

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:24.746 position:50% align:center
the young boy played on
the railing, unattended."

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:25.872 position:50% align:center
Was that then?

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:28.333 position:50% align:center
Yeah. On social media,

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:30.293 position:50% align:center
the responses are
pretty unforgiving.

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:37.634 position:50% align:center
[KYOUICHI]
The people who made those posts?

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.969 position:50% align:center
I'd like to line them up
in a row and mow

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.097 position:50% align:center
each of them down
with a machine gun.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:47.977 position:50% align:center
Yui Ohnuki, 22. Kazushi, three.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.521 position:50% align:center
[TOMOMI]
We don't know much.

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:53.066 position:50% align:center
I think we've only spoken
with them once or twice.

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:54.901 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
If they're basically strangers,

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:56.861 position:50% align:center
then why bother going
out of your way?

00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:04.244 position:50% align:center
[KYOUICHI]
Because she's a fan of my moves.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.788 position:50% align:center
You gotta take care
of your audience.

00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:08.039 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:09.207 position:50% align:center
Makoto!

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.417 position:50% align:center
Jeez, what the heck?

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.877 position:50% align:center
You check in on that
family right away!

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:13.753 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:15.547 position:50% align:center
The girl's a single mother.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.507 position:50% align:center
Weren't you even listening?

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.592 position:50% align:center
Hi. Good afternoon, ma'am.

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:20.677 position:50% align:center
I'd like to introduce--

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.178 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKO]
Kyoichi.

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.723 position:50% align:center
I heard about him from Makoto.

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:27.767 position:50% align:center
And he's a lot more handsome
than what I initially imagined.

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
So, what were you imagining?

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:35.650 position:50% align:center
Never mind that!
Now go, get outta here!

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:37.152 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Hold on just a second.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:39.112 position:50% align:center
Why are you getting
so hot and bothered?

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:40.363 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who
got the request--

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:42.782 position:50% align:center
And as your mother, I'm
seconding that request,

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:45.618 position:50% align:center
so stop running your mouth
and take these over.

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:48.955 position:50% align:center
The baby ones taste sweetest
during this time of the year.

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.331 position:50% align:center
Great for sharing.

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.295 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
So how can I help you?

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:58.673 position:50% align:center
[KAZUSHI]
Banana! Banana! Banana! Banana!

00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:00.675 position:50% align:center
Please be quiet,
we have company here!

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:04.846 position:50% align:center
My boss wanted us
to check in on you.

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:07.140 position:50% align:center
He summoned Makoto
here to help you guys out

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:09.017 position:50% align:center
in case you were
having any trouble.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.227 position:50% align:center
Just seemed like
the right thing to do.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.438 position:50% align:center
That's nice,
but why is our trouble

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:15.523 position:50% align:center
any of your boss's concern?

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:17.650 position:50% align:center
Well, that's the kind
of guy Kyouichi is.

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:21.571 position:50% align:center
I'm happy to see
your kid's doing okay,

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:22.947 position:50% align:center
all things considered.

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:26.493 position:50% align:center
Honestly...

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:30.121 position:50% align:center
It's been an uphill climb for
me ever since he was born.

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:31.790 position:50% align:center
But I'm used to it.

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:34.167 position:50% align:center
That's why I thought
I could make it work.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.710 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Make what work?

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:37.379 position:50% align:center
His father ran off.

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:40.674 position:50% align:center
I was still pregnant,
and child support was never

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:42.509 position:50% align:center
on the table.

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:44.427 position:50% align:center
I've been scraping by
to make ends meet

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:46.888 position:50% align:center
since before he was born.

00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:48.932 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
What do you do for a living?

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:52.394 position:50% align:center
There's a food plant in
Ouji that makes cheap bento.

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:55.355 position:50% align:center
I work the graveyard
shift from 10 to 5.

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:58.400 position:50% align:center
After that I rush home,
cook breakfast,

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:00.568 position:50% align:center
and feed my son
once he wakes up.

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:02.654 position:50% align:center
If I can, I sneak a nap.

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:05.907 position:50% align:center
Or we'll play a bit before
I head back to work.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.409 position:50% align:center
I'd be overwhelmed, too.

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:08.702 position:50% align:center
Sounds rough.

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:11.663 position:50% align:center
I'm always short on time,
and shorter on cash.

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:15.166 position:50% align:center
Grinding five nights a week
only brings 160,000 yen

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.543 position:50% align:center
in each month.

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:18.878 position:50% align:center
That's standard for contractors.

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:22.674 position:50% align:center
There's not much left after
I pay tax and insurance.

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:25.093 position:50% align:center
But rent is 70,000 yen a month,

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:28.847 position:50% align:center
and I'm not sure how I can
cut costs any further.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.435 position:50% align:center
The nonstop calls from the
media definitely don't help.

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:35.061 position:50% align:center
I'm beyond exhausted.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:37.689 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50% align:center
How did you like your banana?

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:41.860 position:50% align:center
[KAZUSHI]
Mmm, it was yummy!

00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:43.903 position:50% align:center
So, your name is Kazushi, huh?

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:45.030 position:50% align:center
[KAZUSHI]
Yep!

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:47.907 position:50% align:center
How about I treat you to lunch?

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:50.410 position:50% align:center
Wait, really? Thanks, Mister!

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:52.746 position:50% align:center
Now, don't take this
the wrong way.

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:55.123 position:50% align:center
I grew up with a
single parent too,

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:58.001 position:50% align:center
so I'm well aware that
mealtime can be a pain.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.002 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO chuckles]

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:00.712 position:50% align:center
And besides, I'm starving.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.263 position:50% align:center
Can I ask you a question?

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:11.514 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
Hm?

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:13.641 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] You're always
with your kid, right?

00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:16.811 position:50% align:center
So uh, why did you go to
the park alone that day?

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:18.146 position:50% align:center
Seems random.

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:23.234 position:50% align:center
[YUI] I liked watching
your boss perform,

00:07:23.318 --> 00:07:26.946 position:50% align:center
even though I could
only do it in passing.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.824 position:50% align:center
I really wanted to stop
and take it in.

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:31.201 position:50% align:center
Which is tough when
your hands are full

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.578 position:50% align:center
with a three-year-old.

00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:34.662 position:50% align:center
I guess...

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:37.207 position:50% align:center
I was trying to find
a moment alone.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.416 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:44.255 position:50% align:center
It's so hard.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.010 position:50% align:center
It's like I'm on
the edge of a cliff.

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:54.265 position:50% align:center
[TOMOMI]
That's the scoop.

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:56.351 position:50% align:center
Well, what do we do right now?

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:58.770 position:50% align:center
We'll continue to
keep an eye on them.

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:01.690 position:50% align:center
Fine by me.
Hey, I'm happy to look out.

00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:04.359 position:50% align:center
But looking's not gonna
change their situation.

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:06.945 position:50% align:center
[KYOUICHI]
That reminds me.

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:08.029 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.740 position:50% align:center
Relax.

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:13.785 position:50% align:center
Just tell your mother the baby
fruits were indeed the best.

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:21.459 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
That bad, huh?

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:22.544 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKO]
Right.

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:25.046 position:50% align:center
Yui thinks she's
teetering near the edge.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.133 position:50% align:center
But she's in more
trouble than she knows.

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:30.385 position:50% align:center
At this rate, she'll fall off.

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:34.597 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
Ms. Ritsuko!

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:42.063 position:50% align:center
Good afternoon.

00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:43.440 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's goin on?

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:44.524 position:50% align:center
[YUI laughs]

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:46.192 position:50% align:center
Some good things, for once!

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:47.527 position:50% align:center
Yo, Kazushi!

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:51.197 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
Go on then, what do we say?

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:55.535 position:50% align:center
Hi, Makoto.

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:56.786 position:50% align:center
Nice to see you.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.121 position:50% align:center
Well, we're off.

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:05.295 position:50% align:center
Does she seem different?

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:06.713 position:50% align:center
She's got a new boyfriend.

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:07.881 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Huh?

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:10.383 position:50% align:center
So that's your assessment
as well, ma'am?

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:12.802 position:50% align:center
Ah, Mister Yoshioka!

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:14.888 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Is dating a crime now?

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:17.849 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIOKA] I can't say much,
but just so you know,

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:21.061 position:50% align:center
there's a con man from
the sex trade who's at large.

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:23.772 position:50% align:center
It starts with flirting,

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:25.607 position:50% align:center
which turns into dates.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.276 position:50% align:center
He'll shower you with
expensive presents.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.154 position:50% align:center
Then when the time is right,
he'll make demands.

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.365 position:50% align:center
Suddenly he'll order
you to pay him back

00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:36.201 position:50% align:center
for all the fine luxuries
he's spoiled you with.

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:38.745 position:50% align:center
If you can't,
then he'll sell you.

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:41.081 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Hold on, what kind of gifts?

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.876 position:50% align:center
I knew something was off!

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:46.670 position:50% align:center
His trafficking ring
makes a killing

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:49.005 position:50% align:center
from all the kickbacks
that they collect.

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:51.132 position:50% align:center
We've been trying to catch
the scumbags in the act

00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:52.634 position:50% align:center
by tailing their
potential marks,

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:56.471 position:50% align:center
but they're highly skilled
at slipping away.

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:59.099 position:50% align:center
You're saying Yui's a target?

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:00.934 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry to tell you this.

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:03.937 position:50% align:center
But they do favor single
mothers who are at risk.

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:07.691 position:50% align:center
If you see anything,
then holler.

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:11.569 position:50% align:center
In the meantime, I got more
girls to keep tabs on.

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:12.737 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:14.572 position:50% align:center
I guess he wants me
to follow Yui then.

00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:16.950 position:50% align:center
You keep a close eye
on that girl, got it?

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:19.160 position:50% align:center
We can't let the poor
thing sell herself!

00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:20.870 position:50% align:center
Right, I hear ya.

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:24.416 position:50% align:center
But hey, sex work is
still legit work, ain't it?

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:26.626 position:50% align:center
I mean, it isn't anything
to be ashamed of.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:27.627 position:50% align:center
Why badmouth it?

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:28.962 position:50% align:center
Don't be naïve!

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:30.964 position:50% align:center
It's a much different story
when you're a woman!

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:32.674 position:50% align:center
Now get going already!

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.366 position:50% align:center
[MAN laughs]
Believe it!

00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:41.326 position:50% align:center
[SHINJI]
Yeah, that's right.

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:42.827 position:50% align:center
She just left.

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:45.663 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I only need one more push.

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:47.916 position:50% align:center
Sure. Best of luck to you too.

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:50.669 position:50% align:center
Watch your step!

00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:52.504 position:50% align:center
Oh. Sorry about that.

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:53.713 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:11:53.797 --> 00:11:55.799 position:50% align:center
Hey. We gonna have a
problem here, dumb kid?

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:57.217 position:50% align:center
Yo buddy!

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.011 position:50% align:center
That's a real nice pair of Rocco
Sandiegos you got there!

00:12:00.095 --> 00:12:02.013 position:50% align:center
Yeah? So what if
they are, ya punk?

00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:03.098 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Dude.

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:04.557 position:50% align:center
I'm actually kind
of a sneakerhead.

00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:07.727 position:50% align:center
Still need to keep hustling
before I can get 'em.

00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:09.145 position:50% align:center
Hustling, huh?

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:10.772 position:50% align:center
What's your preferred
line of work?

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:13.191 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] It's not a huge
deal or anything too cushy.

00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:15.193 position:50% align:center
I'm an errand boy
for the Hidaka Group.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.571 position:50% align:center
You don't say.

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:19.823 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:21.616 position:50% align:center
Me and the guy who runs
their PR were close buds

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.284 position:50% align:center
back in middle school, so...

00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:24.577 position:50% align:center
[SHINJI whistles]

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:27.580 position:50% align:center
Damn, that's a fancy
connection to have.

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:28.665 position:50% align:center
Are you hungry?

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:30.500 position:50% align:center
'Cause I got a few
questions for ya.

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:35.797 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:36.798 position:50% align:center
My treat, pal!

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:37.924 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:40.385 position:50% align:center
So, tell me.

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:43.013 position:50% align:center
If I wanna do business with
those primo Hidaka sex clubs,

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:45.223 position:50% align:center
just whose ass
do I gotta kiss, huh?

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:47.392 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
You a pimp?

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:48.768 position:50% align:center
[SHINJI]
Mm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

00:12:48.852 --> 00:12:51.104 position:50% align:center
I don't mean to brag,
but I'm a vet when it comes

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:53.106 position:50% align:center
to scouting fresh talent.

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:56.276 position:50% align:center
Damn. Never met someone
who sells that kinda stock!

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:59.237 position:50% align:center
[SHINJI] Yeah? I'm still new
to the Ikebukuro scene,

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.281 position:50% align:center
but this sure ain't
my first rodeo.

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:02.949 position:50% align:center
Whoa.

00:13:03.033 --> 00:13:04.492 position:50% align:center
You gotta tell me.

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:07.287 position:50% align:center
How do you convince a hot chick
to start movin' it for cash?

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.456 position:50% align:center
[SHINJI]
You don't convince a girl.

00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:11.750 position:50% align:center
You let her fall
into it herself.

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:13.626 position:50% align:center
All you have to do
is find a pretty,

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.171 position:50% align:center
unhappy piece who's
down on her luck.

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:19.716 position:50% align:center
Single mothers make
the perfect mark.

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:20.675 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Cool.

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:22.385 position:50% align:center
You met anyone promising lately?

00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:25.930 position:50% align:center
[SHINJI]
Between you and me,

00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:29.142 position:50% align:center
remember the kid who fell
off the railing in Senkawa?

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:31.519 position:50% align:center
Well, I scored the brat's mom.

00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:35.231 position:50% align:center
What a joke.

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:37.192 position:50% align:center
I barely had to lift a finger.

00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:39.235 position:50% align:center
She was already barely
hanging on by the skin

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:41.529 position:50% align:center
of her teeth when I found her.

00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:42.781 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:44.741 position:50% align:center
The type of hopeless
tramp who can't get by

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:46.534 position:50% align:center
without a man to help her.

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:50.997 position:50% align:center

Thank you, please come again!

00:13:51.081 --> 00:13:52.332 position:50% align:center
[SHINJI]
See ya!

00:13:57.712 --> 00:14:00.340 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] I'm gonna
make you regret this!

00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:02.342 position:50% align:center
You piece of shit.

00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:04.177 position:50% align:center
Yui's fighting for her life!

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:10.850 position:50% align:center
I wasn't sure what to expect.

00:14:10.934 --> 00:14:12.811 position:50% align:center
But consider me impressed.

00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:14.229 position:50% align:center
It's only been a day.

00:14:14.312 --> 00:14:15.772 position:50% align:center
Yet you've managed to
wrangle me a meeting

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:17.524 position:50% align:center
with your PR friend.

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:18.233 position:50% align:center

No prob.

Oh, here we go.

00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:23.988 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:33.456 position:50% align:center
Yui? Why're you here?

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.375 position:50% align:center
And who's this old lady?

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:38.420 position:50% align:center
So you must be that
lowlife scammer.

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:40.255 position:50% align:center
What're you talking about?

00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:42.215 position:50% align:center
Just who the hell are you?

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:44.092 position:50% align:center
We run a fruit store!

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:45.135 position:50% align:center
[SHINJI]
Uh...

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.553 position:50% align:center
Play him the evidence.

[SHINJI]
You don't convince a girl.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.934 position:50% align:center
You let her fall

Why, you little--

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:02.527 position:50% align:center

Give it here!

Your mother's a real-life
guardian angel.

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:42.734 position:50% align:center
Look after her.

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:45.612 position:50% align:center
Listen, honey.

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:47.113 position:50% align:center
I think we need to talk.

[KAZUSHI laughs]

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.870 position:50% align:center
Vroom! [laughs]

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:55.955 position:50% align:center
Hey, kiddo. Mind holding still?

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:06.466 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Something felt
off the last time we met.

00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:08.176 position:50% align:center
I noticed Kazushi was sad.

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:11.554 position:50% align:center
I've heard of folks
taking their stress out

00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:13.723 position:50% align:center
on their children.

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:14.974 position:50% align:center
For sure.

00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:17.018 position:50% align:center
But when did things
get this bad?

00:16:17.102 --> 00:16:18.770 position:50% align:center
I bet they got worse round
the time you started

00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:20.063 position:50% align:center
seeing Shinji.

00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:24.359 position:50% align:center
[YUI crying]

00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:30.198 position:50% align:center
Ever since the
accident happened,

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:33.159 position:50% align:center
it's like I don't even know
what to do anymore.

00:16:33.243 --> 00:16:35.745 position:50% align:center
I try my best, but my
best is never enough

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:36.913 position:50% align:center
in the end.

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:38.498 position:50% align:center
Then people tell me
that's just the way

00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:40.291 position:50% align:center
the world works.

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:42.460 position:50% align:center
I stay up all night working,

00:16:42.544 --> 00:16:44.254 position:50% align:center
and I parent in the day.

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:46.297 position:50% align:center
But as soon as I try
to relax a little bit,

00:16:46.381 --> 00:16:48.299 position:50% align:center
they say I'm a bad mother.

00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:50.343 position:50% align:center
That I'm careless.

00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:51.886 position:50% align:center
That I should just die.

00:16:57.851 --> 00:17:02.063 position:50% align:center
Sometimes I find
myself resenting him.

00:17:02.147 --> 00:17:03.898 position:50% align:center
Without Kazushi,

00:17:03.982 --> 00:17:06.192 position:50% align:center
maybe I could look
for a full-time job.

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:07.694 position:50% align:center
Dress up nicely.

00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:10.196 position:50% align:center
Or even fall in love someday.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.116 position:50% align:center
I'll think, "It's his fault!"

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:15.618 position:50% align:center

this whole mess.

It's a nightmare!

guy said back there.

more harm than good.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:08.672 position:50% align:center
So you need to let your son go.

00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:10.298 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:11.841 position:50% align:center
It's your best option.

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:13.510 position:50% align:center
I would know.

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:15.845 position:50% align:center
Hold up, Mom.

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:18.223 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKO] You broke your
back to survive, and it still

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:19.683 position:50% align:center
wasn't enough.

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:22.811 position:50% align:center
No one would blame you
for putting him in childcare.

00:18:22.894 --> 00:18:25.355 position:50% align:center
Besides, it wouldn't be forever
since you'd only need

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:27.691 position:50% align:center
as long as it takes to
get back on your feet.

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:29.734 position:50% align:center
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

00:18:29.818 --> 00:18:31.945 position:50% align:center
I've gone ahead and referred
you to a caseworker

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:34.614 position:50% align:center
I've known for years.

00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:36.408 position:50% align:center
When Makoto was born,

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:39.577 position:50% align:center
his father passed away
in an accident.

00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:42.747 position:50% align:center
He left me with the store
and a huge pile of debt.

00:18:42.831 --> 00:18:45.333 position:50% align:center
I was a one-woman operation.

00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:48.545 position:50% align:center
So I decided to place my son
in someone else's custody.

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:55.093 position:50% align:center
For two years after he was born.

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:57.887 position:50% align:center
I never even got to nurse him.

00:18:57.971 --> 00:18:59.639 position:50% align:center
I punished myself.

00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:01.516 position:50% align:center
I believed I was a bad mother.

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:03.810 position:50% align:center
That I'd abandoned my child.

00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:06.396 position:50% align:center
But I refused to stop
working like hell.

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:08.773 position:50% align:center
Once I paid off the debt,
I kept saving.

00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:11.818 position:50% align:center
When I was ready, I got my baby.

00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:15.196 position:50% align:center
As you can see, he turned
out mostly all right.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center
We don't have a lot of money.

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:18.950 position:50% align:center
But if we hear
somebody needs help,

00:19:19.034 --> 00:19:21.870 position:50% align:center
he'll do what he can even
if it means putting himself

00:19:21.953 --> 00:19:23.288 position:50% align:center
on the line.

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:25.081 position:50% align:center
He's a good man, this one.

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:29.377 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna sugar coat it.

00:19:29.461 --> 00:19:32.255 position:50% align:center
Once he hits the teenage years,
things will get rough.

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:34.507 position:50% align:center
He'll probably start
mouthing off to you.

00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:36.885 position:50% align:center
"What do you know, you old hag?"

00:19:36.968 --> 00:19:38.136 position:50% align:center
Stuff like that.

00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:40.597 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, Mommy.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
It'll be okay!

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.352 position:50% align:center
[YUI crying]

00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:55.779 position:50% align:center
Jeez, what a story.

00:19:55.862 --> 00:19:57.489 position:50% align:center
Glad to finally hear it.

00:19:57.572 --> 00:19:59.908 position:50% align:center
Well, your mother's
no angel, Makoto,

00:19:59.991 --> 00:20:01.159 position:50% align:center
not by a longshot.

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:03.078 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'll say.

00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
That's the truth.

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:06.456 position:50% align:center
[TOMOMI]
Hey, Yui.

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:07.540 position:50% align:center
[YUI gasps]

00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:11.795 position:50% align:center
Kyouichi says,
"You've got this!"

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:16.049 position:50% align:center
He'd like to dance for you.

00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:17.425 position:50% align:center
And little Kazu.

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:45.745 position:50% align:center
One day,

00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:47.747 position:50% align:center
when Kyouichi was still a boy,

00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:49.457 position:50% align:center
he lost his parents.

00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:51.126 position:50% align:center
Said it was a car accident.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:59.259 position:50% align:center
Living in Chicago,
he had to learn to grow up fast

00:20:59.342 --> 00:21:02.345 position:50% align:center
while working hard
to master ballet.

00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:05.181 position:50% align:center
If you ask me,
I think that's why family's

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:07.434 position:50% align:center
so important to him.

00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:10.353 position:50% align:center
No matter what shape or
form that family might take.

00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:11.813 position:50% align:center
Heh. Yep!

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:16.359 position:50% align:center
Or maybe he's jealous.
Who knows?

00:21:16.443 --> 00:21:18.403 position:50% align:center
[KAZUSHI]
That's the airplane guy.

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:20.321 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Right. That's him.

00:21:20.405 --> 00:21:22.574 position:50% align:center
He fixed your airplane
for you, didn't he?

00:21:22.657 --> 00:21:23.825 position:50% align:center
[KAZUSHI]
Uh-huh!

00:21:23.908 --> 00:21:25.076 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
You know something?

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.494 position:50% align:center
Your mom is going to
do everything she can

00:21:26.578 --> 00:21:28.705 position:50% align:center
to fix things too.

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.457 position:50% align:center
And I know she can do it.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.541 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:33.626 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You betcha!

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:49.559 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Yui put Kazushi in a
home for the time being.

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:51.644 position:50% align:center
And began searching
for steady employment.

00:21:53.646 --> 00:21:55.899 position:50% align:center
She'd been suffering
in silence alone.

00:21:55.982 --> 00:21:58.193 position:50% align:center
Unaware there could be light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:22:00.028 --> 00:22:01.696 position:50% align:center
We helped her as best we could.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.365 position:50% align:center
This is a family town,
after all.

00:22:05.283 --> 00:22:07.369 position:50% align:center
It isn't the kinda place
that will cast you aside

00:22:07.452 --> 00:22:08.870 position:50% align:center
for just seeking help.

00:22:08.953 --> 00:22:11.164 position:50% align:center
Nah, this?

00:22:11.247 --> 00:22:12.624 position:50% align:center
This is Ikebukuro, friend.
