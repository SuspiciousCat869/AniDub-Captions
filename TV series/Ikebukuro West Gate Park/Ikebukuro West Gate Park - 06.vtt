This doesn't come natural

You see, the owner was
going out of business

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.312 position:50% align:center

the place for whatever.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:50.814 position:50% align:center
So, he went for broke.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.026 position:50% align:center
He managed to scrape
together five million yen

There's a splinter unit called

No, but Hiroto has an idea.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.487 position:50% align:center
More like a theory.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.157 position:50% align:center

them the entire thing up.

I think he wants to
replace him someday.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.420 position:50% align:center
It's possible that King
caught wind of that,

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:40.298 position:50% align:center
so this might be him
sending out a warning.

If each gang is a

00:10:05.689 --> 00:10:07.357 position:50% align:center
And you're sure
that they're real?

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.984 position:50% align:center
There've been
whispers everywhere.

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:12.570 position:50% align:center
I have no doubt that Shadow's
set up shop in this town.

00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:17.867 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Please tell me
Takashi didn't hire them.

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:19.744 position:50% align:center
He wouldn't do
something like that!

00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:21.287 position:50% align:center
So then who?

00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:23.206 position:50% align:center
Hey, maybe it was those
Red Devils that've been

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:24.958 position:50% align:center
hanging around East Gate Park.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.668 position:50% align:center
It's the Red Angels.

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:29.045 position:50% align:center
Doesn't seem like
something they would do.

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:30.422 position:50% align:center
Which leaves...

00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:32.966 position:50% align:center
Someone who's holding
a grudge against Takashi?

00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:34.759 position:50% align:center
Yeah, good luck trying
to narrow that list

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:36.761 position:50% align:center
down to a single person.

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:39.597 position:50% align:center
Okay, so, has King said
anything about this to you?

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:41.599 position:50% align:center
Nah, not so far.

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:43.893 position:50% align:center
Well, catch you later.

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:45.437 position:50% align:center
[SARU] In case you forgot,
you are not one of them,

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.646 position:50% align:center
tough guy.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.440 position:50% align:center
You'll be in trouble
if you get in too deep,

00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:49.941 position:50% align:center
ya hear me?

00:10:50.025 --> 00:10:51.901 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
I just wanna keep the peace.

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:54.738 position:50% align:center
Ha. Should've figured you
wouldn't listen to any advice

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:56.948 position:50% align:center
I have to give you.

00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:59.784 position:50% align:center
You're dealing with Shadow.

00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:01.953 position:50% align:center
So, watch yourself,
and don't get killed.

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:06.499 position:50% align:center
Gee, thanks.

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:09.002 position:50% align:center
'Cause I can't have you dying
before I get that 500 yen

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:10.170 position:50% align:center
from you.

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:12.380 position:50% align:center
You're never gonna
see that cash, idiot!

00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:15.884 position:50% align:center
[SARU]
Be careful, Makoto.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.346 position:50% align:center
Hey! You cheapskate!

00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:21.473 position:50% align:center
You didn't even leave me
money for your coffee!

00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:41.576 position:50% align:center
[CROW] Makoto.
Knight is waiting upstairs.

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:44.954 position:50% align:center
Who's Knight?

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:50.585 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO]
That's close enough.

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:57.342 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Hiroto?

00:11:57.425 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center
So, what's with
the funny nickname?

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:00.637 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO]
Know what's funny?

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.681 position:50% align:center
The teams under my
command make up a third

00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:04.557 position:50% align:center
of the G-Boys in total.

00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:06.976 position:50% align:center
Yet the only folks getting
clowned over and over again

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.353 position:50% align:center
are my people.

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:15.360 position:50% align:center
Ain't this too suspicious
to be called a coincidence?

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:16.861 position:50% align:center
Well, maybe.

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:19.239 position:50% align:center
But we can't say for sure
who's behind the attacks yet.

00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:22.117 position:50% align:center
For all we know, it could
be a lackey with a grudge.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.577 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you've seen
stranger things in your time.

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:27.247 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO] Yeah.
Takashi's seen worse though.

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:33.378 position:50% align:center
Haven't you heard?
That Shadow guy rolls freelance.

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:35.130 position:50% align:center
That's news to my ears.

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:38.341 position:50% align:center
Takashi wouldn't hire
a free agent like that.

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:40.343 position:50% align:center
There's no proof that he's
trying to take down you

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:42.053 position:50% align:center
or your faction of the G-Boys.

00:12:42.137 --> 00:12:43.972 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO]
That's irrelevant!

00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:46.224 position:50% align:center
I've been waiting for this.

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:47.726 position:50% align:center
For the day someone
would be dumb enough

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:49.394 position:50% align:center
to mess with me.

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:53.023 position:50% align:center
No matter who it is.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:56.109 position:50% align:center
No matter how they
choose to pull the trigger.

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:58.987 position:50% align:center
As soon as I hear
the bang, it's on.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.238 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec.

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:02.449 position:50% align:center
Don't you want to
find out the truth first?

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:04.242 position:50% align:center
I'm getting close to
discovering who's behind

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:05.702 position:50% align:center
all these attacks.

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:08.455 position:50% align:center
Promise me you won't
do anything until I do.

00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:09.914 position:50% align:center
All right, fine.

00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:12.042 position:50% align:center
But if my guys get
blindsided one more time

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.753 position:50% align:center
then I won't be able
to play nice anymore.

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:16.504 position:50% align:center
And you can bet there'll
be a true reckoning

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:18.256 position:50% align:center
among the G-Boys.

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:21.509 position:50% align:center
You think you can
go to war with Takashi

00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:23.094 position:50% align:center
and beat him?

00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:26.181 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO] I won't go down easy
like he does, that's for sure!

00:13:26.264 --> 00:13:29.559 position:50% align:center
We're ready to move to
bigger and brighter things.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.644 position:50% align:center
We could even take command
of the whole Tokyo

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.646 position:50% align:center
scene someday!

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:34.981 position:50% align:center
Look, kid.

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:37.567 position:50% align:center
There might not be a lot
of us, but we're fighters.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.235 position:50% align:center
Don't underestimate us.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.823 position:50% align:center
Tell that to your King.

00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:50.163 position:50% align:center
Crap. Who the hell
does he think he is?

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:54.084 position:50% align:center
--[MAN A] Hiroto!
--[MAN B] Sir!

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:55.335 position:50% align:center
[MAN C]
Boss!

00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:56.211 position:50% align:center
Let's roll!

00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:57.253 position:50% align:center
Everything square?

00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:58.630 position:50% align:center
Ready when you are, Knight!

00:13:58.713 --> 00:14:00.757 position:50% align:center
--We've got this!
--[MAN G] It's time to fight!

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:09.641 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Really?

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:11.518 position:50% align:center
In that case...

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:19.359 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Sorry for the short notice.

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:20.735 position:50% align:center
Hey, listen.

00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:22.445 position:50% align:center
We know how this looks,
but you can't possibly think

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:24.155 position:50% align:center
that we're behind this.

00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:25.657 position:50% align:center
If that's the truth,
then it'd be helpful

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.784 position:50% align:center
if I could have your word.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:29.119 position:50% align:center
So, Kyouichi?

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:35.834 position:50% align:center
We're not involved.

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:37.419 position:50% align:center
You sure about that?

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:39.754 position:50% align:center
[KYOUICHI]
You doubt me? That hurts.

00:14:39.838 --> 00:14:42.007 position:50% align:center
Didn't we team up to
take down OK Holdings?

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:47.262 position:50% align:center
We don't have any good
reason to wage a war.

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:49.347 position:50% align:center
So why would I want
to expose my soldiers

00:14:49.431 --> 00:14:51.141 position:50% align:center
to unnecessary danger?

00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:54.102 position:50% align:center
All right, then.

00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:56.396 position:50% align:center
I apologize for
pointing fingers.

00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:58.314 position:50% align:center
That said,

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:00.942 position:50% align:center
if flames start heading our way,

00:15:01.026 --> 00:15:02.777 position:50% align:center
we won't hesitate
to put them out.

00:15:05.155 --> 00:15:09.284 position:50% align:center
[KYOUICHI]
It happens. That's war for you.

00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:10.368 position:50% align:center
Know this.

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:13.204 position:50% align:center
As soon as anyone tries
to spill so much as

00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:15.874 position:50% align:center
a drop of our blood,
the truce is off.

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.142 position:50% align:center
--[phone buzzes]
--[MAKOTO yells]

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:21.773 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
What's the matter?

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:23.191 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Oh, it's nothing.

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:26.695 position:50% align:center
I'm just being stalked by
a dangerous merc is all!

00:16:26.778 --> 00:16:28.655 position:50% align:center
You've heard, right?
This "Shadow"?

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:30.448 position:50% align:center
Sure. But why chase you?

00:16:30.532 --> 00:16:31.825 position:50% align:center
I don't know!

00:16:31.908 --> 00:16:34.994 position:50% align:center
Next time pick up the phone
and you might find out!

00:16:35.078 --> 00:16:38.623 position:50% align:center
I had a feeling that Hiroto
would do this eventually.

00:16:38.707 --> 00:16:40.875 position:50% align:center
He has an abundance
of potential.

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:43.878 position:50% align:center
But what he's lacking
is experience.

00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:46.131 position:50% align:center
And he's missing
a steady partner.

00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:47.424 position:50% align:center
That's why we're different.

00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:50.844 position:50% align:center
Whoa, it's spicy! Huh?

00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:52.512 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:55.265 position:50% align:center
With everything that's
been hitting the fan,

00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:57.976 position:50% align:center
how come you haven't
thought to call me once?

00:16:58.059 --> 00:17:00.937 position:50% align:center
As you know, we're dealing
with a dangerous threat here.

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:03.356 position:50% align:center
This Shadow is still at large.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.192 position:50% align:center
I didn't want you
to get involved.

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:09.195 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I'm not certain
that I can keep you safe.

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:11.489 position:50% align:center
Do not patronize me.

00:17:11.573 --> 00:17:13.950 position:50% align:center
Keep that up and I won't
hesitate to punch you.

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:19.039 position:50% align:center
You think I'm some
kinda helpless groupie?

00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:20.790 position:50% align:center
Someone who only shows
up for the good times

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:23.877 position:50% align:center
and then bails as soon as
things start to get dangerous?

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.837 position:50% align:center
Is that the kind of
man you think I am?

00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:30.592 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'm too jaded to
know what friendship is.

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:32.177 position:50% align:center
But still!

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.637 position:50% align:center
Through the highs and lows
and everything in between,

00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:37.098 position:50% align:center
we've both gone through
hell and back together!

00:17:37.182 --> 00:17:38.558 position:50% align:center
'Cause that's what friends do!

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:43.438 position:50% align:center
At the end of the day,
there's only so many people

00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:45.774 position:50% align:center
you can truly count on in life.

00:17:45.857 --> 00:17:47.859 position:50% align:center
So don't you underestimate me!

00:17:49.444 --> 00:17:51.529 position:50% align:center
Makoto, you're a bonafide idiot.

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:56.409 position:50% align:center
And you're also my friend.

00:17:56.493 --> 00:17:59.454 position:50% align:center
If anyone else gave that
speech I'd be disgusted.

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:01.831 position:50% align:center
But it's you, so I'll excuse it.

00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:04.417 position:50% align:center
I may as well permit
you to assist me.

Track down Shadow's
whereabouts and identity.

00:18:07.504 --> 00:18:10.840 position:50% align:center
Do whatever it takes to drag
the darkness into the light.

00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:12.050 position:50% align:center
And after that?

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:13.635 position:50% align:center
If they're worth their salt,

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:16.388 position:50% align:center
then I'd like to
face them myself.

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:19.391 position:50% align:center
Man. You're really
something else.

00:18:19.474 --> 00:18:22.852 position:50% align:center
Until we can uncover the truth,
you leave Hiroto's men alone.

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:24.062 position:50% align:center
Promise me?

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:27.399 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
Promise.

00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:30.527 position:50% align:center
You'd better make sure you
never tell the other G-Boys

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.071 position:50% align:center
that I actually shook
your hand, got it?

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:35.323 position:50% align:center
Because if I ever
find out you did,

00:18:35.407 --> 00:18:37.075 position:50% align:center
I'll crush your skull
so bad the doctors

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:38.702 position:50% align:center
won't be able to fix it.

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:40.662 position:50% align:center
Whatever, Your Majesty.

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:42.622 position:50% align:center
I shan't breathe a
single word of it to any

00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:44.207 position:50% align:center
of your loyal subjects.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.542 position:50% align:center
What a statement.

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:48.169 position:50% align:center
You sound uncultured,
but I guess it suits you.

00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:54.009 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzes]

00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:57.512 position:50% align:center
What the--?!

00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:59.597 position:50% align:center
Damn it! More of Hiroto's
crew got ambushed.

00:18:59.681 --> 00:19:01.224 position:50% align:center
It happened in West Ikebukuro!

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:03.601 position:50% align:center
Some Donglong guys were
just attacked as well.

00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:05.603 position:50% align:center
It happened at the Xing Fu
restaurant nearby.

00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:06.938 position:50% align:center
You're kidding me!

00:19:07.022 --> 00:19:08.982 position:50% align:center
We should be the ones
to check it out. Come on.

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:10.108 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:30.837 position:50% align:center
[TOSHIAKI]
Finally!

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.714 position:50% align:center
Where the heck
did you run off to?

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:35.800 position:50% align:center
We're all set to shoot the
night scenes, so come back!

00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:37.844 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah. I'm sorry.

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:39.387 position:50% align:center
It's just that I got...

00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:45.268 position:50% align:center
I'll have to call
you back later!

00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:50.315 position:50% align:center
Hey, Crow, thanks for filling
me in on the phone earlier.

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:52.025 position:50% align:center
--What's wrong?
--[CROW] This way, King.

00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:03.953 position:50% align:center
Takashi!

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:08.667 position:50% align:center
I heard that another one
of my units got taken out.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:09.584 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:20:09.668 --> 00:20:11.294 position:50% align:center
Oh, I bet you do.

00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:13.713 position:50% align:center
Especially since you're
siccing Shadow around town

00:20:13.797 --> 00:20:15.632 position:50% align:center
and laughing it up, aren't you?

00:20:16.758 --> 00:20:17.967 position:50% align:center
Don't be stupid.

00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:20.178 position:50% align:center
I told you he's not
the one who hired him!

00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:25.767 position:50% align:center
Word on the street is he
costs an arm and a leg.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.977 position:50% align:center
And while this place
has a lotta rich folk,

00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:31.356 position:50% align:center
you're the only one who'd
profit from crushing me.

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:33.692 position:50% align:center
If you'd like to promote
yourself from Knight to King,

00:20:33.775 --> 00:20:35.360 position:50% align:center
then try using your
brain for once.

00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:39.155 position:50% align:center
This time, Donglong's
men got hit too.

00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
They're not part of the G-Boys.

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:42.784 position:50% align:center
So how do you explain that, huh?

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:44.828 position:50% align:center
How should I know?!

00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:46.621 position:50% align:center
The point is,
three of my best troupes

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:49.541 position:50% align:center
are out of commission,
and I want revenge.

00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:52.627 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI] Tonight, there's a
beast calling itself Shadow

00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:55.588 position:50% align:center
prowling through Ikebukuro.

00:20:55.672 --> 00:20:57.799 position:50% align:center
A monster hired by someone
who wants the G-Boys

00:20:57.882 --> 00:20:59.718 position:50% align:center
to go to war.

00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:02.137 position:50% align:center
But now that they've made
a move on Donglong.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.555 position:50% align:center
It's getting messy.

00:21:05.223 --> 00:21:07.350 position:50% align:center
Somebody out there wants
to completely destroy

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:10.437 position:50% align:center
the balance of our sacred home.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.856 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately for us, they
also seem to be very much

00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:15.191 position:50% align:center
aware of our weaknesses.

00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:17.402 position:50% align:center
To be specific, that's you.

00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:21.990 position:50% align:center
Let's avoid any
further bloodshed.

00:21:22.073 --> 00:21:23.700 position:50% align:center
You need to keep your cool.

00:21:23.783 --> 00:21:26.327 position:50% align:center
Except it's my
blood being spilled.

00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:28.163 position:50% align:center
Look, Takashi promised
me that he'd leave

00:21:28.246 --> 00:21:30.790 position:50% align:center
you guys alone till
we figure things out.

00:21:30.874 --> 00:21:32.917 position:50% align:center
So cool it already!

00:21:33.001 --> 00:21:35.837 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna track down Shadow
and whoever he's working for.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:36.713 position:50% align:center
So please--

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:38.506 position:50% align:center
Once the night is through,

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.800 position:50% align:center
I'm done with the G-Boys
from here on out.

00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:46.890 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO] I'm finished
taking orders from you.

00:21:46.973 --> 00:21:49.851 position:50% align:center
Starting tomorrow, I'm gonna
get things done my way!

00:21:52.187 --> 00:21:53.730 position:50% align:center
You got that, Takashi?

00:21:57.817 --> 00:21:59.361 position:50% align:center
Wait, Hiroto!

00:21:59.444 --> 00:22:01.905 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO]
Too late, kid, the war's begun!
