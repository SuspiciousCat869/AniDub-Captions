00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:17.809 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Yo.

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:18.977 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for making you
stick your neck out

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.937 position:50% align:center
for me like this, Rei.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.772 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.692 position:50% align:center
[REIICHIROU] Look, you
didn't hear this from me.

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:27.819 position:50% align:center
But there are no records
of Shadow that I can find

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:30.155 position:50% align:center
anywhere in the
central database.

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:31.489 position:50% align:center
It's odd.

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:33.283 position:50% align:center
Especially when you factor
in long-standing rumors

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.702 position:50% align:center
among the police
regarding their existence.

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:39.581 position:50% align:center
It's mostly speculation, but one
claim seems highly credible.

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:42.375 position:50% align:center
[REIICHIROU]
Shadow's not a group.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:45.837 position:50% align:center
He's one person.

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:47.922 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Really?

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.091 position:50% align:center
Listen. I'm hearing some
reports coming in from

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:52.844 position:50% align:center
the Juvenile and Community
Safety Divisions.

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:55.889 position:50% align:center
It sounds like there could be
more trouble heading your way.

00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:58.433 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:00.977 position:50% align:center
I'm just making sure that
you're not in over your head.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.897 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Yeah, yeah. I'll be careful.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.775 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. Stay in touch, I got it.

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:11.488 position:50% align:center
Why the heck is everyone
getting so worried about me?

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.698 position:50% align:center
I mean, what am I?
A freakin' toddler?

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:17.869 position:50% align:center
[TELLER] The number you have
dialed is either outside

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:21.247 position:50% align:center
its service area or belongs
to an unpowered device.

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:22.707 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Not again.

00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:58.303 position:50% align:center
[TOSHIAKI]
Okay, cut.

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:00.013 position:50% align:center
Let's all take ten!

00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:02.015 position:50% align:center
[CREWMAN A]
It was a perfect sneak attack.

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:03.933 position:50% align:center
[CREWMAN B]
You gotta be kidding.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.226 position:50% align:center
Not again.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.395 position:50% align:center
You still at it with
that making-of doc?

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.272 position:50% align:center
Aren't we supposed
to be on a break?

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:10.482 position:50% align:center
It's a big deal!

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:12.400 position:50% align:center
You don't get to shoot
these every day.

00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:14.652 position:50% align:center
[CREWWOMAN A] Hey boss, can
you take a look at the dailies?

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:16.154 position:50% align:center
Be right there!

00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:17.405 position:50% align:center
[CREWMAN A]
Oh.

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.532 position:50% align:center
Man, Makoto.
You're getting really good.

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:20.450 position:50% align:center
You absolutely killed it.

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:22.118 position:50% align:center
You keep killing it every time.

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.162 position:50% align:center
Oh, thanks, you guys.

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:26.414 position:50% align:center
[CREWMAN A] Hey, we should
go out for drinks sometime.

00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:28.041 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Yeah. Totally.

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:33.588 position:50% align:center
[TELLER] The number you
have dialed is either outside...

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:34.923 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
C'mon, you jerk.

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:40.387 position:50% align:center
What's the matter? King still
not answering his phone?

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.056 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Figures.

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.933 position:50% align:center
So, did you get a chance
to pass the new intel

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:46.142 position:50% align:center
on to Hiroto?

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.519 position:50% align:center
I did.

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:49.729 position:50% align:center
But he said that whether
Shadow was working alone

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:52.065 position:50% align:center
or as a group, it wouldn't
change a thing.

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:53.233 position:50% align:center
Listen.

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:54.401 position:50% align:center
Call him again and
tell him that Shadow's

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.319 position:50% align:center
a one-man operation.

00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:58.154 position:50% align:center
The ones responsible
for attacking his people

00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:59.614 position:50% align:center
are imposters.

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:01.533 position:50% align:center
Until we know who's
actually behind this,

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:03.076 position:50% align:center
he needs to chill out.

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.285 position:50% align:center
[CROW]
Right.

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:07.747 position:50% align:center
It's Crow.

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:09.582 position:50% align:center
Yeah hey, put me on
with Hiroto, will you?

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.084 position:50% align:center
Hiroto could just talk to me,

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:14.546 position:50% align:center
but instead he wants
to act all dramatic.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.214 position:50% align:center
Doesn't he know
he's not king yet?

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:20.760 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's you.

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:22.303 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Yup, it's me.

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:23.555 position:50% align:center
Find anything new?

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:25.515 position:50% align:center
Say, this stuff is delicious.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:27.600 position:50% align:center
You heard of this new
pudding made for dudes?

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:30.270 position:50% align:center
It's pretty good.
You should get on that if not.

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:31.813 position:50% align:center
You'll be sad you missed out!

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:35.608 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Well?

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:36.735 position:50% align:center
[SARU sighs]

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:40.447 position:50% align:center
I found out which
people hired Shadow.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.033 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Wait. You mean it was a group?

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.325 position:50% align:center
[SARU]
That's right.

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.244 position:50% align:center
It's the shell company
for Northern Kanto's

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:51.124 position:50% align:center
Maruken Sougyou.
Mars Enterprises.

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
It seems they have expansion
plans for Ikebukuro.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.796 position:50% align:center
Plus, there's beef with
Donglong over turf lines

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.590 position:50% align:center
in the red-light district.

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:01.634 position:50% align:center
Some argument over
talent poaching.

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:03.386 position:50% align:center
Sounds about right.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.472 position:50% align:center
[SARU] Weren't the guys who got
jumped at that Chinese joint

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:07.015 position:50% align:center
Donglong too?

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
They were.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.852 position:50% align:center
Honestly, something's
not adding up.

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:12.103 position:50% align:center
[SARU]
Go on.

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:13.772 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
One of my sources filled me in.

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:17.108 position:50% align:center
Shadow's a solo artist,
not a gang.

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:18.818 position:50% align:center
[SARU]
Huh. Interesting.

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:20.070 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Meanwhile,

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:21.738 position:50% align:center
the random douchebags
attacking Hiroto's men

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:24.657 position:50% align:center
are going by the same name.
It's weird.

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:28.870 position:50% align:center
[SARU] There's a chance
that Mars is playing a part

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:30.163 position:50% align:center
in this too.

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:31.831 position:50% align:center
Remember what I
said the other day?

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:33.291 position:50% align:center
It's all about balance.

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:36.461 position:50% align:center
If they want to gain influence,

00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:38.046 position:50% align:center
it's in their best interest
to make trouble

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.798 position:50% align:center
for the Hidaka Group.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.883 position:50% align:center
After all, you gotta rock
the boat if you wanna

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:43.259 position:50% align:center
command the ship.

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.222 position:50% align:center
In that regard,

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:50.392 position:50% align:center
I suppose that everything's
proceeding according to plan.

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
Gotcha.

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:54.521 position:50% align:center
So that's what the real
troublemakers are after, huh?

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:56.314 position:50% align:center
Hey, thanks for all your help

00:05:56.398 --> 00:05:57.357 position:50% align:center
[SARU]
Hey, no problem.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
I went ahead
and told Takashi too.

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:00.652 position:50% align:center
Later.

00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:04.155 position:50% align:center
So you'll answer
Saru but not me?

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:07.575 position:50% align:center
[MAN]
Don't move.

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:13.581 position:50% align:center
Makoto Majima.
Do you know who I am?

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:15.125 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Should I?

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.711 position:50% align:center
[MAN] Let's just say I've
got a bone to pick.

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:19.838 position:50% align:center
Because destroying the
G-Boys is more than some

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:22.132 position:50% align:center
petty turf war.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.676 position:50% align:center
What I'm really after is power.

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.720 position:50% align:center
So get ready to bow down.

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:28.972 position:50% align:center
Do you even hear
yourself right now?

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:31.474 position:50% align:center
They aren't gonna
take this sitting down.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.478 position:50% align:center
[MAN] Don't worry,
I'll get my revenge.

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:40.567 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO grunting]

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:53.455 position:50% align:center
[TOSHIAKI]
Makoto! Wake up already!

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.583 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you all right?

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:57.667 position:50% align:center
You were out.

00:06:57.751 --> 00:06:59.711 position:50% align:center
Bedtime's over, sleepyhead.

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:01.379 position:50% align:center
We need to finish shooting.

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:04.341 position:50% align:center
At this rate, the store'll close
before we can wrap production.

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:08.845 position:50% align:center
Some guy in a rabbit
mask attacked me.

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:10.388 position:50% align:center
That sounds creepy.

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:13.016 position:50% align:center
Actually, that would
make a great movie pitch.

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:18.271 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Toshiaki. Is that camera on?

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:20.482 position:50% align:center
[TOSHIAKI] Yeah. It should
still be recording.

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:26.321 position:50% align:center
Okay. Lemme know
when you're done here.

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:27.864 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
We will. Thanks.

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:32.160 position:50% align:center
If this works, then we'll
know who the guy was.

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:33.745 position:50% align:center
Whoa, you're a genius.

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:36.122 position:50% align:center
Crushin' it as a detective
and an indie actor.

crawling back to the city.

call Hiroto right away!

Uh-- On it!

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
It's me. I've got an update!

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:22.794 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO]
What is it?

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:24.796 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] The five goons
ambushing your boys

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:27.215 position:50% align:center
are the same ones
from OK Holdings.

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:30.093 position:50% align:center
Except now it's Mars
Enterprises who's hired them.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:31.928 position:50% align:center
Takashi isn't involved!

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:33.346 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO] 
Heh.

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.057 position:50% align:center
Then I'll have to make
sure that they get theirs too.

00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:38.768 position:50% align:center
Listen! We know who
the bad guys are.

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:41.021 position:50% align:center
Which means there's
no reason to go to war!

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:42.439 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO FACTION yelling]

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:43.773 position:50% align:center
We'll make 'em pay!

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:45.567 position:50% align:center
--Take 'em out for Knight!
--[HIROTO A] Heck yeah!

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.152 position:50% align:center
It was only a matter of time.

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:48.778 position:50% align:center
This was always going to happen.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.280 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Hiroto! Listen to me!

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:51.990 position:50% align:center
Can't say I'm surprised.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:55.118 position:50% align:center
Me and Takashi had bad
blood from the beginning.

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:58.329 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO]
The time has come!

00:08:58.413 --> 00:09:00.040 position:50% align:center
We're going to war!

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:01.875 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO FACTION]
Bring it on!

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:05.795 position:50% align:center
Listen, Crow, you need to
hustle and tell that idiot

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:07.005 position:50% align:center
to call it off!

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:08.757 position:50% align:center
And what the heck
am I supposed to say?

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.800 position:50% align:center
Whatever you need to
buy us some more time.

00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:11.718 position:50% align:center
Hurry!

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:12.844 position:50% align:center
[CROW]
Got it!

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:18.892 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
C'mon, man. Pick up!

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:22.020 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
Makoto?

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:23.730 position:50% align:center
What?

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:26.483 position:50% align:center
Didn't I say to
pick up when I call?

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.109 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.446 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
So, where you at?

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:37.702 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
You see that?

00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:39.704 position:50% align:center
Your hunch is likely correct.

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:42.707 position:50% align:center
Though I can't help but
notice some discrepancies.

00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:44.876 position:50% align:center
First off, the Mars office.

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:46.628 position:50% align:center
What's with the tight security?

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:50.090 position:50% align:center
It's almost as if they're on
high alert all of a sudden.

00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:53.134 position:50% align:center
If Saru is correct
and everything's fine,

00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:54.761 position:50% align:center
then why the commotion?

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:57.138 position:50% align:center
They must be bracing
themselves for the worst.

00:09:57.222 --> 00:10:00.100 position:50% align:center
Huh. Does seem
pretty suspicious.

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:01.559 position:50% align:center
Are you aware of
what else is missing

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:03.645 position:50% align:center
from your speculations?

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:05.689 position:50% align:center
The Red Angels.

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:06.940 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:08.692 position:50% align:center
Kyouichi said they'd stay
put unless someone

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:10.735 position:50% align:center
made a move against them!

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:12.404 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI] How do you know they
aren't waiting for the perfect

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:14.072 position:50% align:center
moment to deal a blow?

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:17.492 position:50% align:center
C'mon. Now who's talking crazy?

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:19.869 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
I do want to avoid war.

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:23.373 position:50% align:center
But still. There are
things you can change.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:26.292 position:50% align:center
And things you cannot.

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:28.712 position:50% align:center
So, you're shooting a film.

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:30.255 position:50% align:center
I heard your acting's awful.

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:32.340 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Gee thanks, and your point is?

00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:35.510 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
I mean, you must be sick of it.

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:37.387 position:50% align:center
Pretending to be
a nice guy and all.

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:09.461 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW]
Makoto Majima.

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:12.130 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Are you Shadow?

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:14.549 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW] There are
those who call me that.

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:16.676 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
What do you want?

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.554 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW]
I came to this city to do a job.

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:22.265 position:50% align:center
And then, I heard rumors
about a troubleshooter

00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:26.019 position:50% align:center
who chooses to work
for justice instead of cash.

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:29.898 position:50% align:center
I was intrigued so I thought
I'd tail you for a bit.

00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:34.694 position:50% align:center
You sure are interesting.
Not much of a thespian, though.

00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:37.322 position:50% align:center
Are you here working
for Mars Enterprises?

00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:38.740 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:42.702 position:50% align:center
Along with all those masked
amateurs, unfortunately.

00:11:42.786 --> 00:11:46.164 position:50% align:center
Seems they wanna liven
things up around town.

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:47.374 position:50% align:center
You see,

00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:49.167 position:50% align:center
the agreement was for
all parties involved

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.211 position:50% align:center
to use my name
as a calling card.

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:53.546 position:50% align:center
This is the way I see it,
if you're just flying solo

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.340 position:50% align:center
and wanna show some results,

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:58.426 position:50% align:center
then a little bit of PR
can go a long way.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.554 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Sure. I can see that.

00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:04.683 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW] The only job I actually
did was the restaurant hit.

00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:08.812 position:50% align:center
Clean, precise, and perfect,
just how I like it.

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:10.605 position:50% align:center
But the ones that
the young punks did?

00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:13.233 position:50% align:center
Heh. Absolute mess.

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:14.442 position:50% align:center
Checks out.

00:12:14.526 --> 00:12:16.569 position:50% align:center
That must've been bad
for your reputation.

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:19.322 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW] And that reputation is
everything for an independent

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:21.991 position:50% align:center
contractor like me.

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:25.704 position:50% align:center
Naturally, they'll have to pay
up for marring my record.

00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:26.955 position:50% align:center
Wait a second.

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:29.541 position:50% align:center
Are you saying you
attacked the Mars Office?

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:32.210 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW]
Several executive heads.

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:34.754 position:50% align:center
Anyone who had "board member"
written on his card.

00:12:37.716 --> 00:12:40.844 position:50% align:center
Of course,
that still leaves the footmen.

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:42.637 position:50% align:center
Who've now gone missing.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.977 position:50% align:center
Luckily, I hear you're quite
an expert at finding people.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.980 position:50% align:center
Yeah, or so I've been told.

00:12:52.063 --> 00:12:54.441 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW] Great, because if
you track them down...

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:57.861 position:50% align:center
...I'll get rid of them.

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:03.199 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
It's a deal.

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:04.701 position:50% align:center
I'll help you.

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:07.370 position:50% align:center
But in return, there's
another person I want you

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:08.663 position:50% align:center
to pay a visit to.

00:13:10.582 --> 00:13:11.833 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
A weak link.

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:15.253 position:50% align:center
I can't have him drag us down.

00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:29.225 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Did something happen?

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:31.603 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI] I was about to
ask the same thing.

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:35.023 position:50% align:center
'Cause Hiroto got
jumped last night.

00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
Who the hell're you?

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.446 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO grunts]

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:45.992 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO yells]

00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:48.953 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO grunts]

00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:59.172 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
His left knee is mangled.

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:01.299 position:50% align:center
He'll be stuck in the
hospital for a minute.

00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:05.637 position:50% align:center
There are all kinds of
rumors going around,

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.931 position:50% align:center
but I was attending
a G-Boys party.

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:09.140 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Okay.

00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:11.142 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
You know,

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:13.019 position:50% align:center
you have a bad habit of
rushing in regardless

00:14:13.103 --> 00:14:14.688 position:50% align:center
of the consequences.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:16.398 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
I did what I had to.

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:18.233 position:50% align:center
I hate this infighting.

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:21.194 position:50% align:center
Besides, now that he's
down for the count,

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:23.363 position:50% align:center
Hiroto's men'll blame
it on Yamamoto's.

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:26.741 position:50% align:center
I spread rumors that
they're the ones working

00:14:26.825 --> 00:14:28.326 position:50% align:center
for Mars, not you.

00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:31.579 position:50% align:center
That should wrap this up nicely.

00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:34.958 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
All right.

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:41.548 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
"Nice guy" my ass.

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:52.684 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Hello.

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:54.602 position:50% align:center
'Sup, Crow? What's new?

00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:57.647 position:50% align:center
[CROW] Dude, did you hear about
what happened to Hiroto?

00:14:57.731 --> 00:15:00.233 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Oh, yeah, I feel for the guy.

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:02.610 position:50% align:center
But maybe this'll make
his lackeys chill out.

00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:04.487 position:50% align:center
[CROW]
Yeah, about that...

00:15:04.571 --> 00:15:07.323 position:50% align:center
They're planning to launch
a full-blown assault.

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:09.784 position:50% align:center
They're hell-bent on getting
revenge for what went down!

00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:10.994 position:50% align:center
You're kidding me.

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:12.871 position:50% align:center
Wait, wasn't it obviously
those five guys

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:14.831 position:50% align:center
that Mars had on payroll?

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.583 position:50% align:center
I tried to tell them that.

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:18.877 position:50% align:center
Except nobody wants
to hear any of it.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.713 position:50% align:center
They've convinced themselves
it was King's fault.

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:25.425 position:50% align:center
I can't hold 'em back by myself.
You gotta help me out!

00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:27.135 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO C]
Move it, kid!

00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:28.595 position:50% align:center
--[CROW] Hey!
--[MAKOTO] Crow?

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:31.848 position:50% align:center
Crow? You there?

Pick up! Come on! Pick up!

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:40.940 position:50% align:center
Takashi! It's bad!

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.618 position:50% align:center
Takashi already knows
what's coming his way.

00:15:53.078 --> 00:15:54.579 position:50% align:center
Go on.

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:57.374 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] As the leader of
the G-Boys, it falls on him

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:59.876 position:50% align:center
to settle this however he can.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.128 position:50% align:center
If that means war,
then war it is.

00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:05.423 position:50% align:center
Look guys, I get it.

00:16:05.507 --> 00:16:07.133 position:50% align:center
Nothing about this
has anything to do with

00:16:07.217 --> 00:16:08.385 position:50% align:center
the Red Angels.

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:11.221 position:50% align:center
But I'm out of options,
so please.

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:13.181 position:50% align:center
I'm asking you to help us.

00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:15.975 position:50% align:center
You said to hold off
till the sparks fly.

00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:19.729 position:50% align:center
I'm not keen on letting my
troops bear needless casualties.

00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:23.149 position:50% align:center
No doubt, but we're screwed
if we don't stop this.

00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:26.611 position:50% align:center
If we do show up, then
it's gonna get bloody.

00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:28.446 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
I have a plan.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:31.366 position:50% align:center
If it works, then no one
involved has to get hurt.

00:16:38.248 --> 00:16:39.457 position:50% align:center
Traitor.

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:41.751 position:50% align:center
You're gonna pay for
what you did to Knight.

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:42.836 position:50% align:center
That so?

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:45.171 position:50% align:center
We're ready for
whatever you've got.

00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:49.759 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Hold on! Stop!

00:16:49.843 --> 00:16:51.678 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO C]
What're those guys doing here?

00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:53.638 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO D] This ain't
your fight! Butt out!

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:58.309 position:50% align:center
We came to support
the real King.

00:16:58.393 --> 00:17:00.520 position:50% align:center
That right?
You wanna go?

00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:01.521 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO A]
Yeah, step off!

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:03.440 position:50% align:center
[CROWD chattering]

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:05.191 position:50% align:center
[HIROTO E] What the
hell's he talking about?

00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:10.822 position:50% align:center
[KYOUICHI] You see,
I've grown fond of this place.

00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:15.410 position:50% align:center
Ikebukuro is a peaceful town.

00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:20.373 position:50% align:center
And the reason it stays that
way is thanks to my friend.

00:17:20.457 --> 00:17:22.459 position:50% align:center
Raise a hand against the King,

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:25.045 position:50% align:center
and you ultimately raise a
hand against the Red Angels

00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:26.129 position:50% align:center
as well.

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:28.340 position:50% align:center
Now if that happens,

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:31.051 position:50% align:center
we'll wring the blood
out of your bones.

00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:32.302 position:50% align:center
Got it?

00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:36.139 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
So, what'll it be, boys?

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:37.974 position:50% align:center
Think you can post up
against this many of us

00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:39.267 position:50% align:center
and still win?

00:17:56.159 --> 00:17:57.869 position:50% align:center
Welcome to Griffith, uh--

00:17:57.952 --> 00:18:00.747 position:50% align:center
Good evening. I need to
borrow this shop for a bit.

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:04.626 position:50% align:center
Oh. Go right ahead.

00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:08.171 position:50% align:center
All right, cut the tape!

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:10.674 position:50% align:center
[CREWMAN A] Cut on Scene
25A, checking footage!

00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:12.467 position:50% align:center
Thanks, King.
That was nice work.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:15.970 position:50% align:center
So cool! Really!
What a star performance!

00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:19.224 position:50% align:center
What's so difficult
about this again?

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:21.810 position:50% align:center
Your part is much easier
to play, so don't start.

00:18:21.893 --> 00:18:24.562 position:50% align:center
Especially since you're
here to be my bodyguard.

00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:26.564 position:50% align:center
I mean it's not like the
director rewrote the script

00:18:26.648 --> 00:18:27.982 position:50% align:center
for me, you know.

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:29.776 position:50% align:center
Maybe you only think
this is hard because

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:32.529 position:50% align:center
you're bad at faking your
goody-two-shoes act.

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:35.407 position:50% align:center
You should get over yourself.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:36.658 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
We'll be in the back.

00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:38.034 position:50% align:center
[TOSHIAKI]
Sure, help yourself!

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:40.537 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Here we are.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.455 position:50% align:center
Will they really show up?

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:44.249 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
Don't worry about them.

00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:46.126 position:50% align:center
They'll be here soon.

00:18:46.209 --> 00:18:48.211 position:50% align:center
Saru told me.

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:50.839 position:50% align:center
Apparently, Mars tossed
them to the side.

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:52.924 position:50% align:center
But hey, when you're
as thirsty for revenge

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:54.092 position:50% align:center
as they are,

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:56.386 position:50% align:center
you aren't going to
give up that easily.

00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:58.054 position:50% align:center
[CREWWOMAN A screams]

00:18:58.138 --> 00:18:59.514 position:50% align:center
[CREWMAN B]
Hey, it's a closed set!

00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:07.313 position:50% align:center
[YAMAMOTO] Boy, am I sick of
wearing these sweaty things!

00:19:07.397 --> 00:19:09.065 position:50% align:center
Look who it is.

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:11.234 position:50% align:center
Andou. Majima.

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:13.278 position:50% align:center
You can't hide from us anymore!

00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:15.321 position:50% align:center
We're taking you punks down.

00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:18.033 position:50% align:center
And after we're
done, Kyouichi's next!

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:22.912 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW] So you're the
king of Ikebukuro.

00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:27.459 position:50% align:center
I've heard a lot about you.

00:19:27.542 --> 00:19:29.461 position:50% align:center
Shadow, right?

00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:32.922 position:50% align:center
How's about I take these two
and let you take the others.

00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:35.050 position:50% align:center
I'm dyin' to see what
you're capable of.

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:36.634 position:50% align:center
What'd you say?!

00:19:36.718 --> 00:19:37.969 position:50% align:center
You bastard!

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:45.727 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:50.231 position:50% align:center
[crunch]

00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:51.566 position:50% align:center
[KIMIMOTO gasps]
Sto--

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:54.527 position:50% align:center
That's intense.

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:59.324 position:50% align:center
[GROUP yells]

00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:43.535 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW]
Fascinating.

00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:45.870 position:50% align:center
I wonder where you picked
up such solid moves.

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:48.748 position:50% align:center
From the streets.

00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:50.333 position:50% align:center
That checks out.

00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:52.168 position:50% align:center
Skill and technique
can be refined,

00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:55.380 position:50% align:center
but speed and instinct are
something that you're born with.

00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:56.923 position:50% align:center
It's quite apparent
that you possess

00:20:57.007 --> 00:20:58.967 position:50% align:center
an abundance of natural talent.

00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:01.928 position:50% align:center
[TOSHIAKI]
That was insane!

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:04.055 position:50% align:center
Action like this
is hard to come by.

00:21:04.139 --> 00:21:05.348 position:50% align:center
I'm totally using this.

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:06.474 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:11.021 position:50% align:center
But... I need that!

00:21:11.104 --> 00:21:12.897 position:50% align:center
All right, I'm off.

00:21:12.981 --> 00:21:14.774 position:50% align:center
If you ever catch the urge
to get your hands dirty

00:21:14.858 --> 00:21:16.901 position:50% align:center
underground, then feel
free to drop me a line

00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:18.153 position:50% align:center
sometime, eh?

00:21:18.236 --> 00:21:20.739 position:50% align:center
I have an inkling you'd
be quite successful.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.542 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] With that,
the film was completed.

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:35.086 position:50% align:center
And it actually performed well.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.589 position:50% align:center
It's even getting
submitted to a festival.

00:21:37.672 --> 00:21:39.007 position:50% align:center
Up next,

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:42.969 position:50% align:center
pre-production on a new script
with lots of gun action.

00:21:43.053 --> 00:21:46.264 position:50% align:center
Toshiaki might not look it,
but the man's dedicated.

00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:53.063 position:50% align:center
And in this town,
dedication equals strength.

00:21:58.443 --> 00:22:03.114 position:50% align:center
With that, the gray spaces in
Ikebukuro shifted color a bit.

00:22:03.198 --> 00:22:04.491 position:50% align:center
Thanks to this case,

00:22:04.574 --> 00:22:06.701 position:50% align:center
the red parts of the
neighborhood got even redder.

00:22:09.496 --> 00:22:10.580 position:50% align:center
And me?

00:22:10.663 --> 00:22:12.123 position:50% align:center
I'm selling fruit.

00:22:12.207 --> 00:22:14.376 position:50% align:center
Not that there's
much else I can do.

00:22:14.459 --> 00:22:16.044 position:50% align:center
I'll do my best all the same.

00:22:17.796 --> 00:22:18.838 position:50% align:center
No matter what.
