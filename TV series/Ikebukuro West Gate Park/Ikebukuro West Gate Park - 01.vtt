Ikebukuro is the best.

00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.917
It's in the northwest part
of downtown Tokyo.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.166
An area full of skyscrapers...

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.291
...and department stores...

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:26.041
...where we live
our lives in peace.

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:34.750
Yeah, it's about to go down.

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:00.542
[MAKOTO]
Right on time!

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:02.166
We're reaching the overpass!

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:08.542
I've got a clear
visual on the car.

00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:16.583
[JUNKIE yells]

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.667
Hey, get back here, you junkie!

00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:35.667
[MAKOTO] Everyone's polite
and follows the rules here.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.667
People smile and say hi as
they walk down the street.

00:01:45.583 --> 00:01:47.000
--There he is!
--We found him!

[JUNKIE gasps]

[JUNKIE]
King!

00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:35.125
He's here!

00:02:35.208 --> 00:02:36.291
All right!

Damn, what a knockout!

00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:10.000
So cool!

00:03:14.917 --> 00:03:17.500
Good work, Makoto. Thanks.

00:03:18.917 --> 00:03:21.709
You always gotta hog
the fun part for yourself,

00:03:21.792 --> 00:03:22.834
hey, Takashi?

00:03:26.542 --> 00:03:28.667
[MAKOTO] We're about
love and harmony.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.417
It's the friendliest
place on earth.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.250
Yep, that's why
Ikebukuro's the best!

00:05:59.417 --> 00:06:01.709
Well, what's the
sitch this time?

00:06:01.792 --> 00:06:02.834
Spill it.

00:06:08.125 --> 00:06:09.083
[MAKOTO]
Hm?

00:06:10.166 --> 00:06:12.125
Do you remember that junkie
we chased through traffic

00:06:12.208 --> 00:06:13.834
the other day?

00:06:13.917 --> 00:06:15.208
This is related.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.417
[MAKOTO]
Is that some new makeup trend?

00:06:21.542 --> 00:06:23.291
[RITSUKO]
Nice to see you, Takashi!

00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:25.375
Ritsuko, hi. How are you?

00:06:27.417 --> 00:06:28.500
Oh, dear!

00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:32.166
A pretty little girl like you
ought to keep her face

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.500
nice and clean.

00:06:33.583 --> 00:06:34.583
That's a girl?

00:06:34.667 --> 00:06:36.083
[RITSUKO]
What do you think, genius?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.625
There we go. Much better.

00:06:41.291 --> 00:06:42.667
Right then.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.083
Don't you have important things
you should be discussing

00:06:44.166 --> 00:06:45.291
with your friend?

00:06:45.375 --> 00:06:47.125
I can stay and look
after the fruit stand.

00:06:47.208 --> 00:06:49.166
Make yourself useful
and watch the girl.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.375
How 'bout we call
the shots, Mom?

00:06:52.458 --> 00:06:54.667
So, kid, you got a name?

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.375
Yeah, it's Mion.

00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:57.625
[MAKOTO]
And your age?

00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:00.458
I'm 12. Why, you planning
something sketchy?

00:07:07.333 --> 00:07:09.750
All right, here're your orders!

00:07:09.834 --> 00:07:11.792
One miso ramen!

00:07:11.875 --> 00:07:14.291
And the usual for Makoto.

00:07:14.375 --> 00:07:16.500
Fruit ramen with the works.

00:07:16.583 --> 00:07:18.000
Sweet. Let's dig in!

00:07:22.583 --> 00:07:24.417
I think he's the only
reason they bother keeping

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.750
that mess on the menu.

00:07:26.834 --> 00:07:29.667
Okay.
Sorry 'bout the wait, King.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.041
One Tournedos Rossini
with foie gras.

00:07:35.208 --> 00:07:36.542
And this is a ramen joint?

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:40.625
[MAKOTO]
Yeah, some ex-G-Boys run it.

00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:42.667
What the heck are
you talking about?

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.291
And while we're at it, who're
you weirdos supposed to be?

00:07:45.375 --> 00:07:47.417
You mind telling me
what your deal is?

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.417
You really don't
have a clue, huh?

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.000
I see. You must not
be from around here.

00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:53.792
So, the G-Boys.

00:07:53.875 --> 00:07:56.792
They're a tough crowd
who hang out in Ikebukuro.

00:07:56.875 --> 00:07:58.834
This guy's Takashi Andou.

00:07:58.917 --> 00:08:00.417
They call him their King.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.625
You could say he's
the guy in charge.

00:08:02.709 --> 00:08:05.792
Oh, that big guy's Hiroto,
his number two.

00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:07.750
So how about you, Mion?

00:08:07.834 --> 00:08:09.166
What's your story?

00:08:10.667 --> 00:08:13.458
Listen, we're not gonna
hurt you or anything.

00:08:13.542 --> 00:08:15.083
Is there something
I can help you with?

[MION crying]

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
My mom needs help.

00:08:26.083 --> 00:08:27.875
What they did to
her was terrible.

00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:31.542
[TAKASHI]
So yeah.

00:08:31.625 --> 00:08:33.417
A few of my guys caught
Mion trying to light

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.917
a whole building on fire.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.458
It was the North
Gate Smoke Tower.

00:08:37.542 --> 00:08:39.041
[HIROTO]
You know the one.

00:08:39.125 --> 00:08:41.500
That dark skinny hi-rise next
to the station that sticks out

00:08:41.583 --> 00:08:43.542
like a sore thumb.

00:08:43.625 --> 00:08:47.083
There's lots of shops inside
hawkin' all kinds of drugs.

00:08:47.166 --> 00:08:49.625
Lately, there's been
more noise than usual.

00:08:49.709 --> 00:08:52.709
Thanks to the traffickers and
everything they bring with 'em.

00:08:52.792 --> 00:08:54.917
For one, the guy who
went postal on the road

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.625
was trippin' on something
he bought there.

00:08:57.709 --> 00:09:00.250
This girl's mom ended up in
the ER after getting run down

00:09:00.333 --> 00:09:01.875
by some other junkie.

00:09:04.083 --> 00:09:06.333
[TAKASHI]
The perp is on probation.

00:09:06.417 --> 00:09:08.250
He's broke, so a
decent settlement

00:09:08.333 --> 00:09:10.041
is out of the question.

00:09:10.125 --> 00:09:13.250
Bad places like that should
be burned to the ground!

00:09:13.333 --> 00:09:14.667
Don't try to stop me.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.417
I'll keep lighting it up till
it's nothing but ashes!

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.083
Mion, where's your father?

00:09:20.166 --> 00:09:21.125
Who knows?

00:09:21.208 --> 00:09:23.417
It's always been the two of us.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.000
You know,

00:09:25.083 --> 00:09:27.875
I never see her at home 'cause
she works late to pay the bills.

00:09:27.959 --> 00:09:29.667
Through the weekends.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.291
And even on holidays.

00:09:32.625 --> 00:09:33.959
It just isn't fair!

00:09:38.041 --> 00:09:40.583
[TAKASHI] You've been dealt
the same hand, Makoto.

00:09:40.667 --> 00:09:41.959
I'm sure you can relate.

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:45.250
Listen up.

00:09:45.333 --> 00:09:48.375
Let's consider this
an official request.

00:09:48.458 --> 00:09:52.208
Help me drive the North Gate
dealers out of Ikebukuro.

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:55.625
The G-Boys don't like
rats selling on our turf.

00:09:55.709 --> 00:09:58.208
Do whatever it takes
to get the job done.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.792
You really have a soft spot
for weepy kids, don't you?

00:10:02.875 --> 00:10:04.375
Like you're the tough guy here.

00:10:09.417 --> 00:10:10.291
Okay.

00:10:10.375 --> 00:10:12.291
What should our next move be?

00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:14.458
Are you one of those
G-Boys as well?

00:10:14.542 --> 00:10:16.750
I'm just a regular
fruit vendor, kid.

00:10:16.834 --> 00:10:18.917
Takashi and I are just
old friends, that's all.

00:10:21.041 --> 00:10:23.750
For this kinda puzzle... Yeah.

00:10:23.834 --> 00:10:26.792
I think I know just the
guy who can help us out.

00:10:26.875 --> 00:10:28.208
Like a friend of yours?

00:10:38.625 --> 00:10:41.667
You really the chief of police
and not a scammer?

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.166
I'm the real deal.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:46.291
I've been acquainted with Makoto
since he was a youngster.

00:10:46.375 --> 00:10:48.417
He knows the city better
than anyone I know,

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.875
so I've had him assist me
on cases quite a few times.

00:10:54.375 --> 00:10:56.250
Reiichirou Yokoyama.

00:10:56.333 --> 00:10:58.542
But I like to call him Big Rei.

00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:00.917
Graduated top of his
class at UTokyo.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.041
So he comes in handy sometimes.

00:11:03.125 --> 00:11:05.000
Go ahead, don't be shy.

00:11:05.083 --> 00:11:07.834
It's my treat, so order
anything your heart desires.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.750
Um, thanks a lot, mister.

00:11:09.834 --> 00:11:12.291
Now then.
Let's get down to business.

00:11:12.375 --> 00:11:14.125
There's a decent amount
of detail to cover,

00:11:14.208 --> 00:11:17.250
and we don't want to keep
Mion out too late, do we?

00:11:17.333 --> 00:11:18.709
Take a look at this.

00:11:18.792 --> 00:11:20.542
We've gathered some evidence
pointing toward the spread

00:11:20.625 --> 00:11:23.542
of a dangerous new type
of addictive drug.

00:11:23.625 --> 00:11:26.583
Exhibit A:
Festive baggies, right?

00:11:26.667 --> 00:11:28.709
The merchandise inside
is sprayed with narcotics

00:11:28.792 --> 00:11:31.458
made from three grams'
worth of dried toxins.

00:11:31.542 --> 00:11:33.583
But it's actually being sold
on the market as a kind of

00:11:33.667 --> 00:11:35.625
trendy perfume.

00:11:35.709 --> 00:11:38.250
It affects the brain
immediately, inducing a kind of

00:11:38.333 --> 00:11:40.208
temporary high.

00:11:40.291 --> 00:11:44.166
In some cases, it can cause
seizures, increased heart rate,

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:48.041
breathing issues, low blood
pressure, or brain injury.

00:11:48.125 --> 00:11:51.166
The cells in your head
simply collapse and die.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.667
[MAKOTO] Dude, can't you
make it illegal or something?

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.208
We can't ban a product outright
unless we can somehow

00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:58.500
confirm its illicit substance.

00:11:58.583 --> 00:12:00.583
And therein lies the conundrum.

00:12:00.667 --> 00:12:03.125
A dealer can add in a large
quantity of vitamin E

00:12:03.208 --> 00:12:05.417
to act as a masking agent
whenever they mix in

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.875
other chemicals to prep
it to be shipped out.

00:12:07.959 --> 00:12:11.417
It can take several months to
properly analyze a sample.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.917
Fortunately, regulations
have come a long way,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.291
and we've seen a decrease in the
number of large dispensaries.

00:12:17.375 --> 00:12:19.291
On the other hand, the
traffickers keep finding

00:12:19.375 --> 00:12:21.750
legal loopholes that allow
them to make new chemicals

00:12:21.834 --> 00:12:23.375
outside of regulation.

00:12:23.458 --> 00:12:26.583
And they get more and more
sly about how they sell.

00:12:26.667 --> 00:12:28.375
It's a game of cat and mouse.

00:12:28.458 --> 00:12:31.041
I guess even the police
can't touch these guys.

00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:32.917
Sounds like a tough situation.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.667
What, so you're
just gonna give up?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.417
Well, let's see.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.291
First things first, I think
we should check out

00:12:39.375 --> 00:12:41.542
their Headquarters.

00:12:41.625 --> 00:12:43.250
The shops do everything
they can to look like

00:12:43.333 --> 00:12:45.041
they operate above board.

00:12:45.125 --> 00:12:46.917
I doubt you'll find
anything too suspicious

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.083
if you waltz in without a plan.

00:12:49.166 --> 00:12:51.083
[MAKOTO] The pushers are
small-time, though.

00:12:51.166 --> 00:12:53.709
There's gotta be some
weak spot we can crack.

00:12:53.792 --> 00:12:57.959
Besides, I can't quit fightin'
till I do right by Mion's mom.

00:12:58.041 --> 00:13:00.000
No telling what this
kid will do if I don't.

00:13:02.375 --> 00:13:04.041
I'll figure it out.

00:13:04.125 --> 00:13:05.875
And I'm gonna do it
my way, got it?

00:13:08.208 --> 00:13:10.375
I actually feel kinda sorry
for those shmucks

00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:12.625
now that you're
coming after them.

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:14.166
Listen.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.166
You still need to tread lightly
since there might be bigger

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.041
factions at play.

00:13:18.125 --> 00:13:21.041
Be sure not to try
anything too risky.

00:13:21.125 --> 00:13:22.709
[MAKOTO]
Copy. I'll be careful.

00:13:28.166 --> 00:13:30.041
Come on.

00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:31.792
Go home already, kid.

00:13:31.875 --> 00:13:34.333
Didn't Big Rei tell us
we should be careful?

00:13:34.417 --> 00:13:35.834
No way!

00:13:35.917 --> 00:13:38.250
I want a good look at those
punk losers who hurt my mom!

00:13:38.333 --> 00:13:39.709
What, are you gonna stop me?

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:03.375
Yeah, totally.

00:14:03.458 --> 00:14:05.333
We're sellin' through
all the stock.

00:14:05.417 --> 00:14:06.542
Smells nice.

00:14:11.834 --> 00:14:13.583
This is the new stuff
you got, right?

00:14:13.667 --> 00:14:15.750
[CLERK A]
Yeah. It just came in.

00:14:15.834 --> 00:14:18.375
It's way pricier at other shops.

00:14:18.458 --> 00:14:20.625
They don't look
like street junkies.

00:14:20.709 --> 00:14:22.875
We don't know who is
involved with drugs here.

00:14:22.959 --> 00:14:25.917
Some of the customers probably
think this is a normal shop.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.542
There are other stores here.

00:14:27.625 --> 00:14:29.709
This building has plenty of
businesses who aren't involved

00:14:29.792 --> 00:14:31.834
in anything illegal.

00:14:31.917 --> 00:14:34.750
Mion, if we hadn't caught
you, then other people

00:14:34.834 --> 00:14:36.500
would've gotten
hurt by the fire.

00:14:37.917 --> 00:14:40.959
Hey there, folks.
Now what can I do for ya?

00:14:41.041 --> 00:14:43.291
Wait a second, minors
aren't allowed in here!

00:14:49.542 --> 00:14:50.709
[OHKOSHI yells]

00:14:50.792 --> 00:14:52.542
That stuff was primo stock!

00:14:53.625 --> 00:14:54.500
Let's go!

00:14:54.583 --> 00:14:55.625
Don't just stand there!

00:14:55.709 --> 00:14:57.291
We need to make them pay!

00:14:57.375 --> 00:14:59.208
You didn't have to throw
that jar, you know!

00:14:59.291 --> 00:15:01.333
Sorry. I just kind of panicked!

00:15:01.417 --> 00:15:02.709
C'mere!

00:15:02.792 --> 00:15:03.917
[MAKOTO]
Don't look back!

00:15:05.125 --> 00:15:06.125
This way!

00:15:07.375 --> 00:15:08.333
[CLERK A]
Hey!

00:15:12.458 --> 00:15:14.083
You ready? We gotta jump!

00:15:14.166 --> 00:15:15.125
[MION gasps]

00:15:19.709 --> 00:15:22.000
Hurry up, there's no time!

00:15:22.083 --> 00:15:23.041
[CLERK A]
Upstairs!

00:15:35.291 --> 00:15:36.250
Crap!

00:15:40.083 --> 00:15:42.917
[MION] Wait, I think
we're in the clear!

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.125
You don't know that.

00:15:44.208 --> 00:15:45.750
There's a place up ahead
that we can get into

00:15:45.834 --> 00:15:46.917
from the roof.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.333
We can lose him in there!

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:52.709
What happened to all that talk
about me playing it safe?

00:15:52.792 --> 00:15:55.542
That's why I decided to take
the easy route this time.

00:15:55.625 --> 00:15:56.875
Quit complaining!

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.375
[MAKOTO] Whoo!
Man, talk about a close call!

00:16:02.458 --> 00:16:03.750
Coulda gone better.

00:16:03.834 --> 00:16:05.250
Yeah.

00:16:05.333 --> 00:16:07.166
But they didn't find out who we
were or why we were there,

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.250
so we got off easy.

00:16:09.333 --> 00:16:10.625
They probably thought
they were dealing with

00:16:10.709 --> 00:16:12.458
a couple of weirdos.

00:16:12.542 --> 00:16:14.834
[YOSHIOKA]
Yo kiddo, it's been a while.

00:16:19.542 --> 00:16:20.917
[MAKOTO]
Yoshioka.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.458
Another friend of yours?

00:16:32.625 --> 00:16:35.125
[MION]
Oh. So you're a policeman too?

00:16:35.208 --> 00:16:36.250
Yeah.

00:16:36.333 --> 00:16:37.917
Much like everyone
else, this boy and I

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.917
have quite the history together.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.291
And you wouldn't believe all the
trouble I've seen him get into.

00:16:43.375 --> 00:16:44.250
[MION]
Like what?

00:16:44.333 --> 00:16:45.792
Well, let's see.

00:16:45.875 --> 00:16:48.250
When Makoto was
younger, your age,

00:16:48.333 --> 00:16:50.625
we had him and his pals
held in protective custody

00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:52.166
and caught them trying
to sneak a peek into

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.709
the ladies' changing room.

00:16:53.792 --> 00:16:55.375
Hey, I keep telling you
not to bring that up!

00:16:55.458 --> 00:16:58.583
Jeez! This is exactly why
I actively try to avoid you.

00:16:58.667 --> 00:17:01.834
Look. He's grown into such
a respectable young man.

00:17:04.291 --> 00:17:07.458
By the way, it's a shame what
happened to your mother.

00:17:07.542 --> 00:17:09.458
I've been wanting to dig up
some dirt on that shop

00:17:09.542 --> 00:17:11.458
for a while now myself.

00:17:11.542 --> 00:17:13.125
Which is why I take
the occasional stroll

00:17:13.208 --> 00:17:14.792
around this neighborhood.

00:17:14.875 --> 00:17:17.208
She and I can cover a lot
more ground than the police,

00:17:17.291 --> 00:17:19.542
and we can get back to you
with any leads we find.

00:17:19.625 --> 00:17:22.208
If you're willing to share
any intel you have with us.

00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:23.750
Don't be dumb.

00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:26.583
Why would a detective share
classified info with a civilian?

00:17:32.792 --> 00:17:34.834
Ohkoshi.

00:17:34.917 --> 00:17:37.792
That's the name of the man
who owns the tower.

00:17:37.875 --> 00:17:39.458
I can't give you anything else.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.083
[MION]
Thanks a bunch, detective!

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.583
You ready?

00:17:54.125 --> 00:17:55.583
[ZERO-ONE]
Bingo bango.

00:17:55.667 --> 00:17:57.333
Based on what I found
from the dark web

00:17:57.417 --> 00:17:59.208
and some old pharma news,

00:17:59.291 --> 00:18:01.250
this dude's our
most likely target.

00:18:01.333 --> 00:18:02.750
[MION]
That's him!

00:18:02.834 --> 00:18:04.625
[ZERO-ONE]
Yep, that's Ohkoshi.

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:06.959
He's a big deal in
the meds scene.

00:18:07.041 --> 00:18:08.542
What's more...

00:18:08.625 --> 00:18:10.667
I broke into one of the
tower servers and managed

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.750
to steal some sales
data from them.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.041
That's nothing for
a master hacker.

00:18:17.125 --> 00:18:20.291
With a few clicks he can access
any information you might need.

00:18:20.375 --> 00:18:22.250
He's Zero-One. Remember that.

00:18:23.583 --> 00:18:26.792
[ZERO-ONE] Sales usually dip
once a week on Wednesdays.

00:18:26.875 --> 00:18:28.583
I bet he's closing up early.

00:18:28.667 --> 00:18:31.917
Probably to check his stock
numbers or hold a staff meeting.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.333
So, in other words,

00:18:33.417 --> 00:18:35.417
Wednesdays are the
day that Ohkoshi...

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.041
...comes to the store.

00:18:37.125 --> 00:18:38.875
Most likely, anyway.

00:18:38.959 --> 00:18:39.959
[MION laughs]

00:18:41.917 --> 00:18:44.750
[MAKOTO] A mover like him
doesn't just play shop.

00:18:44.834 --> 00:18:47.333
I bet he dabbles in hardcore
illegal stuff, too.

00:18:48.834 --> 00:18:52.417
He has to be scoring them
through some secret channel.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.500
If we peep where it goes down,

00:18:54.583 --> 00:18:56.291
then we can tip off the police.

00:18:59.417 --> 00:19:02.041
[HIROTO] We've been tailing the
suspect for most of the week.

00:19:02.125 --> 00:19:04.583
He's got a handful of other
boutiques and checks in

00:19:04.667 --> 00:19:06.417
on a different one each day.

00:19:07.959 --> 00:19:10.875
Every other day, he drops by
an old apartment complex

00:19:10.959 --> 00:19:12.375
before going home.

00:19:12.458 --> 00:19:15.750
Maybe that apartment is where
we'll find our next clue.

00:19:15.834 --> 00:19:17.417
[HIROTO]
When it's not Ohkoshi,

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.166
it's the Smoke Tower clerk who
stops in after closing time.

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.333
We managed to snag the access
code from some security footage.

00:19:32.709 --> 00:19:34.500
From here on, it could get ugly.

00:19:34.583 --> 00:19:36.208
You'd better wait
for us in the car.

00:19:36.291 --> 00:19:38.500
Be careful now. Don't die!

00:19:38.583 --> 00:19:40.667
You best hang back too.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.709
We're less suspicious
if it's just us.

00:19:58.792 --> 00:19:59.834
Huh?

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.500
This is it.

00:20:12.625 --> 00:20:15.333
[MAKOTO] I mean, this is
about as illegal as it gets.

00:20:17.166 --> 00:20:19.542
It's what they call
a homegrown setup.

00:20:19.625 --> 00:20:22.542
He was cultivating natural
products and making

00:20:22.625 --> 00:20:24.500
dangerous synthetics.

00:20:24.583 --> 00:20:27.208
Interesting.
Think he has a license?

00:20:27.291 --> 00:20:28.875
[MAKOTO]
Doubt it.

00:20:28.959 --> 00:20:30.333
Looks like we've got him.

00:20:32.834 --> 00:20:35.583
[MION]
So, are you a G-Boy too?

00:20:35.667 --> 00:20:36.625
Yeah.

00:20:36.709 --> 00:20:38.458
And are you friends with Makoto?

00:20:38.542 --> 00:20:39.709
Not exactly.

00:20:39.792 --> 00:20:42.417
Him and the King happen
to be close buds is all.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.834
He's cool, but homeboy's
not really one of us.

00:20:44.917 --> 00:20:46.208
Oh, okay.

00:20:49.792 --> 00:20:50.959
[HIROTO]
What's up?

00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:52.834
That's the clerk from
the Smoke Tower shop!

00:20:52.917 --> 00:20:55.125
The clerk?
He shouldn't be here already.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:02.917
Hey, where ya goin' kid?

00:21:04.166 --> 00:21:05.166
Ow!

00:21:07.917 --> 00:21:09.750
What's your damage,
you little turd?

00:21:12.083 --> 00:21:13.500
Get back here!

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.083
[CLERK A]
Gotcha. There we go!

00:21:21.208 --> 00:21:23.125
Makoto!

00:21:28.375 --> 00:21:29.959
I got you now, Mion.
You good?

00:21:31.542 --> 00:21:32.542
Makoto!

00:21:34.792 --> 00:21:35.959
Not bad.

00:21:36.041 --> 00:21:38.166
It looks like you got
to hog the fun today.

00:21:41.959 --> 00:21:44.667
[MAKOTO] We made quick
work of the case after that.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:46.667
Since they knew
what I looked like,

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.083
we had some G-Boys
infiltrate the Tower instead.

00:21:50.875 --> 00:21:53.041
Posing as customers,
they secretly planted

00:21:53.125 --> 00:21:55.458
the homegrown drugs we found.

00:21:55.542 --> 00:21:58.041
Meanwhile, Zero-One hit send,

00:21:58.125 --> 00:22:00.709
and an anonymous tip
was sent to the police.

00:22:00.792 --> 00:22:02.208
After receiving the report,

00:22:02.291 --> 00:22:04.291
Yoshioka and his team
searched the shop.

00:22:07.083 --> 00:22:08.583
The two pushers were arrested.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:14.458
The store shut down,
and North Gate Smoke Tower

00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:16.041
vanished from Ikebukuro.

00:22:17.792 --> 00:22:19.250
Another job in the can.

00:22:26.625 --> 00:22:27.875
[MION]
Makoto!

00:22:27.959 --> 00:22:31.166
So uh, look who's out
of the hospital now!

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:33.041
Hi, I'm Mion's mother.

00:22:33.125 --> 00:22:36.291
Thank you so much for
looking after my little angel.

00:22:36.375 --> 00:22:39.709
Nah. She practically
took care of me.

00:22:39.792 --> 00:22:42.625
I got her caught up, but I left
out some of the details.

00:22:42.709 --> 00:22:44.917
So, make sure you play it cool.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.917
Don't worry, I won't tell.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.166
Keep it between us kids.

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:52.500
It turns out grown-ups aren't
as lame as I thought they were.

00:22:52.583 --> 00:22:54.792
I don't know what it's
like to have a father,

00:22:54.875 --> 00:22:57.000
but I bet it might be nice to
have one as long as they

00:22:57.083 --> 00:22:58.667
were as awesome as you!

00:23:11.583 --> 00:23:13.166
There's still
something buggin' me.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:15.750
It's just...

00:23:15.834 --> 00:23:17.875
Big Rei told us how
dispensaries like that have

00:23:17.959 --> 00:23:20.792
huge organizations backin' 'em.

00:23:20.875 --> 00:23:23.208
But we still don't
know who they are.

00:23:23.291 --> 00:23:26.500
I doubt there's anyone
plotting to get even here.

00:23:26.583 --> 00:23:28.875
If they are, they don't
know us at all.

00:23:28.959 --> 00:23:32.625
[MAKOTO] Sure. But...
the clerk at the shop?

00:23:32.709 --> 00:23:34.417
He definitely wasn't
from around here.
