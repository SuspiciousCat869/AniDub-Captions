[FUMIKA]
Citizens of Ikebukuro.

00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:16.016 position:50% align:center
We are an organization of
activists toiling day and night

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.893 position:50% align:center
to restore our country to
its former greatness.

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:21.896 position:50% align:center
And next Saturday,
right here in Ikebukuro,

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.149 position:50% align:center
we will be holding a
demonstration to call attention

00:00:24.232 --> 00:00:25.358 position:50% align:center
to our work,

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:27.736 position:50% align:center
in which I encourage
all of you to take part!

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:29.112 position:50% align:center
Citizens unite!

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:30.905 position:50% align:center
Let's take back our homeland!

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.699 position:50% align:center
[CRF]
Yeah!

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:34.075 position:50% align:center
Well, that's charming.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:36.244 position:50% align:center
Is this one of those hate
rallies you mentioned?

00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:37.454 position:50% align:center
Sadly,

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:38.955 position:50% align:center
they like to pick
a random group,

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.665 position:50% align:center
scream for them
to get out of Japan,

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:42.709 position:50% align:center
and roam the streets looking
for someone from that

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:45.503 position:50% align:center
community so they can
hurl verbal abuse at them.

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:48.131 position:50% align:center
Fumika Jounouchi and her
followers in particular

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:51.634 position:50% align:center
have chosen to indiscriminately
target Asian immigrants.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.720 position:50% align:center
They've dubbed themselves
the Citizens for Removing

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:56.264 position:50% align:center
All Foreigners from
Our Native Japan.

00:00:56.348 --> 00:00:58.391 position:50% align:center
CRF, for short.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:01.186 position:50% align:center
Look. Not for nothing,
but my adopted little sister

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.313 position:50% align:center
happens to be Chinese, you know.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.565 position:50% align:center
Why hire us as bodyguards for
them when they're the ones

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:06.733 position:50% align:center
being lame?

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:08.276 position:50% align:center
It's confusing.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.154 position:50% align:center
Besides, isn't your movement in
direct opposition to theirs?

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.364 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:14.491 position:50% align:center
We're the Association
Against Hate Speech

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:15.992 position:50% align:center
and Ethnic Discrimination.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.370 position:50% align:center
Of course, we disagree
with their harmful rhetoric,

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:19.621 position:50% align:center
to say the least.

00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:21.414 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, there are
people among our numbers

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:23.291 position:50% align:center
with extremist mindsets
who would have us

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:25.168 position:50% align:center
resort to violence.

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.212 position:50% align:center
But if that happens,
the optics could shift,

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:29.506 position:50% align:center
and we'd end up looking
like the bad guys.

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:31.508 position:50% align:center
Which is why you're having
me and the G-Boys

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:33.385 position:50% align:center
play bodyguard for them.

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:34.969 position:50% align:center
That's ironic.

00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:37.681 position:50% align:center
It's like you're protecting your
enemies from yourselves, huh.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.432 position:50% align:center
Long as I'm being paid
my standard rate,

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:40.975 position:50% align:center
then it's fine by me.

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:42.102 position:50% align:center
Still though.

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:44.646 position:50% align:center
Something's not adding up.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.316 position:50% align:center
Isn't this kind of demonstration
supposed to be illegal?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.151 position:50% align:center
And I thought the government's
current policy

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:53.530 position:50% align:center
was to promote international
residency, isn't it?

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:56.449 position:50% align:center
[HISANO] If it wasn't for the
recent influx of foreign labor,

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.535 position:50% align:center
Japan would stop running.

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:01.287 position:50% align:center
You even had busy districts
like this in economic danger

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:03.623 position:50% align:center
due to population loss.

00:02:03.707 --> 00:02:05.959 position:50% align:center
The truth is that we all
owe a debt of gratitude

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:08.336 position:50% align:center
when it comes to
migrant workers.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.587 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:11.339 position:50% align:center
So what's the point of
throwing a big protest

00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:14.175 position:50% align:center
against the folks who help
make Ikebukuro thrive?

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:16.386 position:50% align:center
This is a time when the
laws are getting stricter

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.638 position:50% align:center
and stricter and such
outrageous displays

00:02:18.722 --> 00:02:20.306 position:50% align:center
are hardly held anymore.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.977 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I have no idea
what it is they're thinking.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.979 position:50% align:center
There must be
something else here.

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:03.410 position:50% align:center
Hey there, Mako!

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:05.078 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's happening, Guo?

00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:07.831 position:50% align:center
I didn't know it was your
turn to help out today.

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.916 position:50% align:center
No, that's not why I came by.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.376 position:50% align:center
Actually, there's a
good friend of mine

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.670 position:50% align:center
who wanted to talk to you
about something real quick.

00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:17.757 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:20.010 position:50% align:center
I'm the lady who runs
the Chinese restaurant

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.137 position:50% align:center
by the Ikebukuro
Paradise building!

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.389 position:50% align:center
The name's Meifaa Yamashita.

00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:25.640 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKO]
Go with them.

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:26.766 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Huh?

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.977 position:50% align:center
I can manage the shop
by myself today.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.395 position:50% align:center
You sure about that?

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:32.647 position:50% align:center
You'll be way more helpful
to these two ladies

00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:34.107 position:50% align:center
than you'd be to me.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.568 position:50% align:center
Us fellow shopkeepers have
to look out for one another

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:38.153 position:50% align:center
as much as possible.

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:39.821 position:50% align:center
I appreciate that a lot.

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:42.198 position:50% align:center
It's truly reassuring
to hear you say it.

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.536 position:50% align:center
[YAMASHITA] It's been a
long time since I set up shop

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:49.748 position:50% align:center
in this building.
Twenty years, give or take.

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.459 position:50% align:center
Ten years in, I met a girl who
came from Hunan Province

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:56.379 position:50% align:center
in China, and before I knew it,
Meifaa and I got married.

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:59.007 position:50% align:center
We've run this business
together ever since.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.801 position:50% align:center
Luckily, the neighborhood's
been good to us.

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:03.553 position:50% align:center
But then recently--

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:05.096 position:50% align:center
Not so much, huh?

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.307 position:50% align:center
The same thing's been
happening to other businesses

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.809 position:50% align:center
in the area that happen
to employ foreigners.

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.061 position:50% align:center
It's terrible.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.229 position:50% align:center
They haven't done
anything to deserve this.

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:14.856 position:50% align:center
Did you catch it on video?

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:16.358 position:50% align:center
Of course we did.

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:19.152 position:50% align:center
But the men in the footage
took care to hide their faces.

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:21.071 position:50% align:center
I heard there are
activists in this town

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:23.031 position:50% align:center
who're doing everything
they can to drive out

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:24.783 position:50% align:center
foreigners like us.

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:26.743 position:50% align:center
Something tells me that
might be why they're

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:28.578 position:50% align:center
harassing our friends here.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.830 position:50% align:center
I wonder why that rings a bell.

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.248 position:50% align:center
Did you hear anything else?

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:34.459 position:50% align:center
A while ago, there was
a fire that broke out

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:36.628 position:50% align:center
at a nice café in this building.

00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:39.130 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, they never
recovered and ended up

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:40.382 position:50% align:center
shutting down.

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:42.926 position:50% align:center
Why don't I try hitting
up the owner for intel?

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center
We might learn something new.

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.639 position:50% align:center
Sorry for volunteering you.

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:50.225 position:50% align:center
I know you've got enough
on your plate already.

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:51.726 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.437 position:50% align:center
It turns out it's related to the
job I'm working on anyway.

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:57.816 position:50% align:center
The Yamashitas treat everybody
they meet with respect.

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:59.109 position:50% align:center
And yet,

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:00.735 position:50% align:center
there are those who attack
them simply because

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.445 position:50% align:center
they were born somewhere else.

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.823 position:50% align:center
The world can be so unfair.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.282 position:50% align:center
What about you?

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.034 position:50% align:center
You started your
new job recently.

00:06:08.118 --> 00:06:09.244 position:50% align:center
Has that been going well?

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:10.495 position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:12.414 position:50% align:center
The people there have
been nothing but kind.

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:14.624 position:50% align:center
Oh, and my father's surgery
in China went well,

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:16.126 position:50% align:center
by the way.

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:18.461 position:50% align:center
It's all thanks to what you and
Ritsuko have done for me.

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:28.013 position:50% align:center
I suppose I'm a fully
naturalized citizen now.

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:31.057 position:50% align:center
But I'll always be considered
a foreigner, huh?

00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:33.977 position:50% align:center
Some things never
change, apparently.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.564 position:50% align:center
But I haven't been able
to make it anywhere else.

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50% align:center
So it gets under my skin
whenever people yell

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:42.861 position:50% align:center
awful things,
telling me to leave or die.

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:49.409 position:50% align:center
[TORII]
Ikebukuro Paradise?

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:51.411 position:50% align:center
Technically speaking,
its official name is

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:53.038 position:50% align:center
the Third Shouei Building.

00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:56.416 position:50% align:center
And at the time it was as
upscale as a complex could be.

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:59.919 position:50% align:center
With apartments up top,
and some shops down below.

00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:02.464 position:50% align:center
I ran a coffeehouse
called the Classic Café

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.424 position:50% align:center
since the day it was completed.

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:07.510 position:50% align:center
I heard you guys had to
deal with a pretty bad fire.

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:08.428 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:10.055 position:50% align:center
I never knew what caused it.

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:12.849 position:50% align:center
In the end, I figured it must've
been a faulty speaker amp

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:15.393 position:50% align:center
I used for playing
background music.

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:16.978 position:50% align:center
Huh, I see.

00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:18.688 position:50% align:center
Then it probably has
nothing to do with what's

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:20.106 position:50% align:center
happening right now.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.483 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:23.568 position:50% align:center
There's a shady group running
around causing trouble

00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:25.320 position:50% align:center
for the current vendors.

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:27.030 position:50% align:center
Including Kayou Hanten.

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:29.240 position:50% align:center
That's the Yamashitas'
restaurant!

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:30.700 position:50% align:center
Think back carefully.

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:32.744 position:50% align:center
Could something else
have caused that fire?

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:34.120 position:50% align:center
Possibly foul play?

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:35.663 position:50% align:center
Th-That's enough!

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:37.540 position:50% align:center
I already told you that
it was an accident!

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50% align:center
Pardon me, but I'm not
sure I have much else

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:40.585 position:50% align:center
to tell you.

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:42.671 position:50% align:center
Kindly finish your tea
and leave at once.

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:48.677 position:50% align:center
It's me.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.095 position:50% align:center
Have you heard any
rumors about weird things

00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:52.764 position:50% align:center
going wrong at
Ikebukuro Paradise?

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:54.974 position:50% align:center
That building? Let's see.

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:58.395 position:50% align:center
I guess the redevelopment
is expanding even further.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:01.648 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Seriously?
They're still not done?

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:03.358 position:50% align:center
Well now it's the North Gate.

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:07.445 position:50% align:center
A big Chinese investor linked up
with a Japanese corporation.

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:10.365 position:50% align:center
Hey, I mean we stand to
make profit if Ikebukuro

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.283 position:50% align:center
starts blowing up, right?

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:13.993 position:50% align:center
As long as they don't
start to invade our turf,

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:16.162 position:50% align:center
then I say they're free
to do what they want.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.258 position:50% align:center
The investor you're inquiring
about is from Beijing.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:31.302 position:50% align:center
They're in charge of a state
council government fund.

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:33.346 position:50% align:center
The other company they've
partnered with is called

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.806 position:50% align:center
Empire Realty.

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:36.850 position:50% align:center
A real estate firm
that's based here.

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:38.768 position:50% align:center
They're spearheading
the project.

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.395 position:50% align:center
So who's actually in charge?

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:42.439 position:50% align:center
Apparently, the fund bought
a controlling stake

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.566 position:50% align:center
in the real estate firm,
which means all parties

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:47.736 position:50% align:center
are under Chinese
leadership at this point.

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:51.072 position:50% align:center
They're buying up prime
metropolitan locations.

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:53.658 position:50% align:center
Does that include
Ikebukuro Paradise?

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:56.703 position:50% align:center
That complex is the centerpiece
of their redevelopment.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:59.289 position:50% align:center
Unsurprisingly, Empire
Realty ultimately wants

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.833 position:50% align:center
to demolish the current
building and erect a new one

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:03.251 position:50% align:center
in its place.

00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:05.503 position:50% align:center
The businesses there are
facing constant harassment.

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:08.381 position:50% align:center
Do you think it's somehow
connected to the redevelopment?

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:10.216 position:50% align:center
I'm not entirely sure.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.844 position:50% align:center
Whoever's disturbing the
peace clearly wants to expel

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:14.721 position:50% align:center
any so-called foreigners.

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:16.181 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile,

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.850 position:50% align:center
you have an overseas entity
spearheading the project.

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:21.811 position:50% align:center
It's difficult to imagine
there's common ground.

00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:23.313 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'll say.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:25.774 position:50% align:center
From the looks of it the
vandalism and property sales

00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:27.609 position:50% align:center
are two different stories.

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:29.069 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzing]

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:32.489 position:50% align:center
What's going on Hisano?

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:36.076 position:50% align:center
He got beat up?

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:37.869 position:50% align:center
[AHE A] I was by the East
Gate handing out fliers

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:40.580 position:50% align:center
and collecting signatures.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:43.708 position:50% align:center
On my way home, I got
jumped outta the blue.

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:45.502 position:50% align:center
What they did was unforgivable,

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:47.420 position:50% align:center
but this is a good chance
to show the media

00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:49.756 position:50% align:center
how violent those
miscreants really are.

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:52.092 position:50% align:center
I'll set up a press
conference right away.

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:54.302 position:50% align:center
That's literally all
you can think of?

00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:56.513 position:50% align:center
When one of us
just got assaulted?!

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:57.639 position:50% align:center
Listen here!

00:09:57.722 --> 00:09:59.766 position:50% align:center
I'm sick and tired
of playing diplomat.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:02.602 position:50% align:center
I think it's time for us
to fight fire with fire!

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center
We both know if we do,
we'll only succeed

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:06.773 position:50% align:center
in lowering ourselves
to their level!

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:08.608 position:50% align:center
I say it's an eye for an eye.

00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:10.819 position:50% align:center
Suit yourself if you want
to get sneered at.

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:12.737 position:50% align:center
There're plenty of us
who're tired of being seen

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:14.197 position:50% align:center
as chickens!

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.574 position:50% align:center
We're ready to do
things our way now!

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:17.992 position:50% align:center
[HISANO]
Wait!

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:21.204 position:50% align:center
So those are the radical
voices in your organization.

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.248 position:50% align:center
Aren't you going
to go after them?

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:26.501 position:50% align:center
I'll try talking to them again
after they simmer down.

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:29.170 position:50% align:center
That's par for the course
when you work with idealists.

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:33.758 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
The North Gate redevelopment.

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:35.677 position:50% align:center
So you've got a feeling that
it's somehow connected

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.387 position:50% align:center
with this matter?

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.763 position:50% align:center
Who even knows?

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:40.807 position:50% align:center
Some parts track,
some of them don't,

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.393 position:50% align:center
and either way I can't
figure out the connection.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:45.645 position:50% align:center
It's obvious that inciting
violence will only cause

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:48.023 position:50% align:center
the police to get
involved in this.

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:49.399 position:50% align:center
So why?

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:50.984 position:50% align:center
What could be worth risking
your whole reputation

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:52.777 position:50% align:center
to accomplish?

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:54.404 position:50% align:center
Who's behind all this?

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:55.989 position:50% align:center
And what could they be up to?

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:58.700 position:50% align:center
Why set this up to begin with?

00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:00.618 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzing]

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.289 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sis. Talk to me.

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:07.625 position:50% align:center
[GUO] It's awful!
Ikebukuro Paradise is on fire!

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:16.968 position:50% align:center
[GUO]
Mako!

00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:19.721 position:50% align:center
Mr. and Mrs. Yamashita.
You're out. Are you okay?

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:22.390 position:50% align:center
Yes.
Thankfully we aren't hurt.

00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:23.725 position:50% align:center
Too much.

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:25.935 position:50% align:center
Maruoka lived
on the sixth floor,

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.228 position:50% align:center
but didn't make it.

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:31.149 position:50% align:center
So what caused the fire?

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:33.651 position:50% align:center
[GUO] Nothing's been confirmed,
but a police officer said

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:35.820 position:50% align:center
that it could possibly be arson.

00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:37.530 position:50% align:center
I can say with utmost certainty

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:40.158 position:50% align:center
this is a declaration
of war on our town.

00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:41.451 position:50% align:center
Makoto.

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:43.495 position:50% align:center
Find out who's
responsible for this,

00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:46.122 position:50% align:center
and the G-Boys
will make them pay.

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:54.798 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Hey, Yoshioka.

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:56.383 position:50% align:center
Any new info on the fire?

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:59.094 position:50% align:center
No. Just what they
said on the news.

00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:00.387 position:50% align:center
It might've been deliberate,

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.931 position:50% align:center
but it also could've been
caused by accident.

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:04.432 position:50% align:center
The apartment where
the fire broke out

00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:06.768 position:50% align:center
was a complete dump
with books and papers

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:08.269 position:50% align:center
lying all over the place.

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:11.773 position:50% align:center
The whole unit might as well
have been made of kindling.

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:13.191 position:50% align:center
If it was arson,

00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:15.443 position:50% align:center
then they chose
the perfect place.

00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:18.154 position:50% align:center
No one would suspect
it was done on purpose.

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:20.115 position:50% align:center
Interesting. Thanks a lot.

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:21.408 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.868 position:50% align:center
You aren't holding
out on me, right, kid?

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:25.662 position:50% align:center
Have you got any leads to share?

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.205 position:50% align:center
I can't say for sure.

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:29.582 position:50% align:center
But about this
weekend's demonstration?

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:32.210 position:50% align:center
You should tighten
up security, okay?

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIOKA]
What's that mean? Wa--!

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:37.090 position:50% align:center
I'm wondering if Jonouchi's
group could be responsible.

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:38.341 position:50% align:center
It's hard to say.

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:40.969 position:50% align:center
The fire originated in
a hoarder's apartment.

00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:42.721 position:50% align:center
Why would anyone
want to target that?

00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:48.184 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
Ikebukuro's changed.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:52.188 position:50% align:center
The streets have been
cleaned up and the high rises

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:54.149 position:50% align:center
just keep on getting taller.

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:56.985 position:50% align:center
And not only that, but
Ikebukuro currently ranks high

00:12:57.068 --> 00:12:59.529 position:50% align:center
on the list of cities
where people want to live.

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.281 position:50% align:center
Isn't that a good thing?

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:03.116 position:50% align:center
Everybody thought that
the old Ikebukuro

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:05.660 position:50% align:center
was this lawless frontier,
and now that image

00:13:05.744 --> 00:13:07.829 position:50% align:center
is finally starting to improve.

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:09.164 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
Maybe.

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:11.750 position:50% align:center
But there's so much
I don't want to change.

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:13.960 position:50% align:center
The down-to-earth atmosphere,

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:17.047 position:50% align:center
the feeling that you can come
here with absolutely nothing,

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.466 position:50% align:center
find your tribe, and
somehow make a life

00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:21.259 position:50% align:center
for yourself.

00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:24.095 position:50% align:center
No matter who you are
or where you're from.

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:26.348 position:50% align:center
If that way of
living disappears,

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:28.433 position:50% align:center
and eventually gets
replaced with prejudice

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:29.893 position:50% align:center
and indifference,

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:31.895 position:50% align:center
it'll be a downright
shame to see as someone

00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:34.064 position:50% align:center
who grew up here, ya know?

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:36.191 position:50% align:center
Even if it all goes to hell,

00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:39.611 position:50% align:center
we'll still end up calling this
place home, won't we?

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:41.112 position:50% align:center
You got that right.

00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:43.490 position:50% align:center
Okay, so what are you planning?

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:45.742 position:50% align:center
I thought we'd talk to the CFA.

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:47.702 position:50% align:center
Although, If I'm being
honest, this situation's

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:49.662 position:50% align:center
got me completely stumped.

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:51.831 position:50% align:center
I figure we might as well
cover all of our bases

00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:54.292 position:50% align:center
until another clue
comes to the surface.

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:57.212 position:50% align:center
Yeah, for some reason
I doubt she'll come quietly.

00:13:57.295 --> 00:13:58.922 position:50% align:center
You're gonna need a hook.

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:01.049 position:50% align:center
I'll tell her Hisano
will be there.

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:07.972 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] We'd like to discuss
your plans for Saturday.

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:10.266 position:50% align:center
Mister Hisano hired our
team to covertly guard

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.019 position:50% align:center
the demonstration from a
potential attack by extremists

00:14:13.103 --> 00:14:14.979 position:50% align:center
in his own group.

00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:18.233 position:50% align:center
But the circumstances have
become more complicated.

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:20.819 position:50% align:center
It appears one of their
members was ambushed.

00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:23.446 position:50% align:center
And a retaliation may
be inevitable now.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.990 position:50% align:center
We've already issued
an official statement.

00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:28.118 position:50% align:center
Whoever it was
that assaulted them,

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:30.453 position:50% align:center
and whoever it was that
set fire to that building,

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:31.705 position:50% align:center
it wasn't us.

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:33.039 position:50% align:center
Hear that?

00:14:33.123 --> 00:14:35.834 position:50% align:center
As far as I'm concerned
somebody's setting us up.

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:38.044 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you guys are the
scoundrels orchestrating

00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:39.421 position:50% align:center
this predicament!

00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:41.715 position:50% align:center
So I take it you intend
to initiate an altercation.

00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:42.966 position:50% align:center
We do not.

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:45.135 position:50% align:center
Should you attempt to
suppress our protesting

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:48.555 position:50% align:center
in a peaceful manner,
then we will comply accordingly.

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:51.182 position:50% align:center
Of course, attack,
and we'll fight back.

00:14:51.266 --> 00:14:53.852 position:50% align:center
You'll find we're as restless
as you are, if not more.

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:55.562 position:50% align:center
If that's really the case,
then I'm willing

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:57.689 position:50% align:center
to cautiously take
you at your word.

00:14:57.772 --> 00:15:00.233 position:50% align:center
Our only goal is to
dispel the humiliation

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:02.277 position:50% align:center
that this great
country has suffered.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.987 position:50% align:center
You should consider
that carefully.

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:09.701 position:50% align:center
[TAKASHI]
She's pretty twisted.

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:12.412 position:50% align:center
I don't get the sense that she's
the one behind all this though.

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:13.747 position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.206 position:50% align:center
But that still doesn't
excuse the fact that she's

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.459 position:50% align:center
screaming threats at
random people including

00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:20.337 position:50% align:center
women and children in
the name of national pride.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.505 position:50% align:center
Though, in the end, she's
only making a gigantic

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:24.257 position:50% align:center
fool of herself.

00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:25.967 position:50% align:center
I noticed the angry
guy at the table

00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:28.094 position:50% align:center
was on a whole other wavelength.

00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:30.889 position:50% align:center
He smelled like he came
from a shell corporation.

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:32.557 position:50% align:center
Or some other shady group.

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:37.437 position:50% align:center
Kouzou Tsukamoto, huh?

00:15:40.732 --> 00:15:41.608 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKO]
Oh?

00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:42.650 position:50% align:center
Welcome back.

00:15:42.734 --> 00:15:44.069 position:50% align:center
You're popular today.

00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:45.236 position:50% align:center
Uh, am I?

00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:55.163 position:50% align:center
[TORII]
My apologies.

00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:57.540 position:50% align:center
I have been a coward
this whole time.

00:15:57.624 --> 00:15:59.626 position:50% align:center
What do you mean, Mister Torii?

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:00.835 position:50% align:center
As long as we've known you,

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:03.004 position:50% align:center
you've always
been neighborly to us.

00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:05.632 position:50% align:center
I came straight over here
from poor Maruoka's

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:07.133 position:50% align:center
funeral service.

00:16:07.217 --> 00:16:09.552 position:50% align:center
The entire family was in tears.

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:12.430 position:50% align:center
If only I'd chosen to
speak up back then.

00:16:12.514 --> 00:16:15.058 position:50% align:center
There's a chance I could've
prevented this tragedy.

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:19.854 position:50% align:center
This contract is from
Tokutomi Industries.

00:16:19.938 --> 00:16:22.732 position:50% align:center
A binding agreement that upon
moving out of the building,

00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:26.903 position:50% align:center
I would never divulge the
full story of what transpired.

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:29.864 position:50% align:center
The other tenants might've
been oblivious to it,

00:16:29.948 --> 00:16:32.575 position:50% align:center
but the harassment from
them was unbearable.

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:36.287 position:50% align:center
Which is the reason I ran away
from Ikebukuro Paradise.

00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:37.831 position:50% align:center
So they're land sharks.

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:39.082 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:41.418 position:50% align:center
They would hound
you relentlessly.

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:43.962 position:50% align:center
Badgering you until you
gave up your lease.

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:46.297 position:50% align:center
I know there were many
others besides myself

00:16:46.381 --> 00:16:48.550 position:50% align:center
who vacated for the same reason.

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:50.343 position:50% align:center
We had no idea.

00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:52.554 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't have since
they worked their way down

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:54.305 position:50% align:center
from the upper occupants.

00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:57.517 position:50% align:center
They probably hadn't started
focusing on the first floor yet.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.977 position:50% align:center
What are you saying?

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.146 position:50% align:center
I was under the impression
that the people harassing us

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:03.148 position:50% align:center
were a nationalist organization.

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:07.485 position:50% align:center
Now I've got you!

00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:11.823 position:50% align:center
[SEKIYA] Unfortunately,
I can't say I'm surprised.

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:13.366 position:50% align:center
Oh, really.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:15.827 position:50% align:center
It sounds to me like you had
a few suspicions of your own.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.079 position:50% align:center
My opinions were
charitable when Tsukamoto

00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:21.041 position:50% align:center
joined us as a benefactor
not too long ago.

00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:23.918 position:50% align:center
Frankly, we were suffering
from financial troubles,

00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center
so it seemed as though
he was heaven-sent.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.591 position:50% align:center
He quickly became our
second-in-command.

00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:30.884 position:50% align:center
His influence increased,

00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:32.969 position:50% align:center
and Representative
Jounouchi found she had

00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:35.680 position:50% align:center
no choice but to bend
to his opinions.

00:17:35.764 --> 00:17:37.432 position:50% align:center
Then is that why your
group decided to hold

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:39.476 position:50% align:center
a demonstration in
the middle of town?

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:40.518 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:42.062 position:50% align:center
If I can be
transparent with you,

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:44.189 position:50% align:center
we also asked what
the point was in throwing

00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:46.733 position:50% align:center
such an unannounced
public display.

00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:48.526 position:50% align:center
And now this news.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.236 position:50% align:center
That it's merely a
cover for buying up land

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.821 position:50% align:center
and jacking up prices.

00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:54.824 position:50% align:center
Backed by foreign funds to boot.

00:17:54.908 --> 00:17:56.117 position:50% align:center
I see now.

00:17:56.201 --> 00:17:58.411 position:50% align:center
Tsukamoto was trying
to drive out the Ikebukuro

00:17:58.495 --> 00:18:00.622 position:50% align:center
Paradise residents, however
he knew he'd get caught

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:02.874 position:50% align:center
if his actions were too obvious.

00:18:02.957 --> 00:18:05.168 position:50% align:center
So he cooked up a scheme
to make all suspicion

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:06.628 position:50% align:center
fall to you.

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:09.589 position:50% align:center
In other words, you've
surmised that he was using us.

00:18:09.673 --> 00:18:12.342 position:50% align:center
Not to mention Hisano
and the G-Boys.

00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:14.302 position:50% align:center
If the current state of
affairs grow more and more

00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:16.388 position:50% align:center
outta hand, Tsukamoto's
guys can use them

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:17.889 position:50% align:center
as a scapegoat.

00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:20.934 position:50% align:center
Torii says he's going to
notify the police of this.

00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:23.061 position:50% align:center
I'd cut ties with
him immediately.

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:25.146 position:50% align:center
I'll pass this along right away.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:28.525 position:50% align:center
That lying cheat should be gone
before the night is through.

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:29.818 position:50% align:center
However,

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:32.278 position:50% align:center
it's too late to stop
the demonstration.

00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:33.446 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.115 position:50% align:center
Can you please re-confirm
our agreement

00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:38.451 position:50% align:center
with the other party so we can
avoid any potential trouble?

00:18:38.535 --> 00:18:39.703 position:50% align:center
Fine by me.

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:42.163 position:50% align:center
It's not like I want
people to get hurt.

00:18:42.247 --> 00:18:43.456 position:50% align:center
But, uh--

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:44.749 position:50% align:center

[YOSHIOKA] Makoto. Please
explain your connection

00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:41.324 position:50% align:center
to that guy.

00:20:41.408 --> 00:20:42.492 position:50% align:center
Don't know him.

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:44.536 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure he was
a random passerby.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.541 position:50% align:center
[LIN] I found some intel
on Tsukamoto's people.

00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:53.753 position:50% align:center
Apparently the firm in Beijing
was exposed for corruption.

00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:56.589 position:50% align:center
They arrested the board,
leaving the firm a mess.

00:20:56.673 --> 00:20:58.591 position:50% align:center
And since the jig was up,
they had to scramble

00:20:58.675 --> 00:21:01.886 position:50% align:center
and collect on everything
they invested in Ikebukuro.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:03.930 position:50% align:center
Then the reason he charged
in at the last minute

00:21:04.014 --> 00:21:06.558 position:50% align:center
was because he was
backed into a corner.

00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:08.685 position:50% align:center
The first step was to
cause a big disturbance

00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:10.770 position:50% align:center
to manufacture some outrage.

00:21:10.854 --> 00:21:14.441 position:50% align:center
Step two was to use the ensuing
chaos to cover his tracks.

00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:15.859 position:50% align:center
Or something like that.

00:21:15.942 --> 00:21:18.319 position:50% align:center
Business at Ikebukuro
Paradise should be able

00:21:18.403 --> 00:21:19.946 position:50% align:center

that Kayou Hanten

The Yamashitas will be
overjoyed to hear that!

00:21:28.997 --> 00:21:31.499 position:50% align:center
There is something that
still concerns me.

00:21:31.583 --> 00:21:33.877 position:50% align:center
We know Tsukamoto was
shaking down tenants

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.046 position:50% align:center
on behalf of Empire Realty.

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:38.715 position:50% align:center
But he also had a group
from Kansai behind him.

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:42.093 position:50% align:center
It's the same place that was
originally backing up Donglong.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.472 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why would they?

00:21:45.555 --> 00:21:46.931 position:50% align:center
It's insidious.

00:21:47.015 --> 00:21:49.142 position:50% align:center
They've been eyeing
this town for a while,

00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:51.978 position:50% align:center
and now they're helping
someone local who's in a bind.

00:21:52.062 --> 00:21:53.438 position:50% align:center
Giving them a boost.

00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:56.066 position:50% align:center
A foothold for expanding
their influence.

00:21:56.149 --> 00:22:00.195 position:50% align:center
A tactic that conquerors
have relied upon for ages.

00:22:00.278 --> 00:22:02.781 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec. I think I remember.

00:22:02.864 --> 00:22:05.033 position:50% align:center
The North Gate Smoke Tower.

00:22:05.116 --> 00:22:07.369 position:50% align:center
There was a guy with
a Kansai accent.

00:22:07.452 --> 00:22:09.037 position:50% align:center
Wait, could it be--?

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.705 position:50% align:center
They've had their sights
set on Ikebukuro

00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:12.707 position:50% align:center
right from the
beginning, clearly.

00:22:12.791 --> 00:22:14.668 position:50% align:center
And it seems they still do.

00:22:14.751 --> 00:22:15.877 position:50% align:center
Bingo.
