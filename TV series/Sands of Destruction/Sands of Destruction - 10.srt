1
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,583
[MALE] A clockwork
robot must obey all orders

2
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,708
given to it by beastmen.

3
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,833
A clockwork robot
must always act in

4
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,375
the interest of beastmen.

5
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,625
A clockwork robot
must never comply

6
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,291
with any order given
to it by a human.

7
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,000
I created the robots,

8
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,750
and programmed them
with these one hundred

9
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,958
and eight laws of robotics.

10
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,000
And from the
robots' point of view...

11
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:21,583
I am none other than the
very God of Creation himself.

12
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:30,708
But why? Why should I
stop at clockwork robots?

13
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,791
[ALLIGATOR MASTER] If I were
to possess the Destruct Code

14
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,666
I could control its power

15
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,625
and become both
the God of Creation

16
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,666
and the God of
Destruction to every

17
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,666
living thing on this planet.

18
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,708
Yes, the Destruct Code...

19
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,000
[ALLIGATOR MASTER] will be mine.

20
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:56,125
Ha! Hey, guys...
Look over there!

21
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,333
Clock Town's known
for its advancements

22
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,958
in robotics, kuma...

23
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,166
The ones we're
looking at right now

24
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,958
are called
clockwork robots, kuma.

25
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,083
Clockwork robots?

26
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,750
Hey, Morte wait up!

27
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,625
[KYRIE] Did I do
something... to annoy you?

28
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,541
You're walking away
in such a hurry.

29
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,708
We didn't come here to
watch the robots all day,

30
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,375
we came here
for a reason.

31
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,541
The Alligator Master
who's in charge of this town

32
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,208
[MORTE] has vital information
about the Destruct Code,

33
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,208
so we need to speak with him.

34
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,791
Well, yeah I know...
I just thought since we're

35
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,041
wanted criminals that
we'd make a plan first.

36
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,958
It's not like we can
march up to his front door

37
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,750
[KYRIE] and start
firing off questions.

38
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,750
The whole reason I put
these ridiculous bunny ears

39
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,875
back on in the first place
was so we could do just that.

40
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,458
So I suggest we
remain inconspicuous--

41
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,166
[panicked stutter]

42
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,291
[laughing]

43
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,125
Good job staying
inconspicuous, kuma.

44
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,541
Hey lady, you alright?

45
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,708
Clockwork robots are
intelligent, but it's not like

46
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,375
they have eyes in
the back of their heads.

47
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,958
Are you guys travelers?

48
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,666
Tell me, what do you
think about Clock Town

49
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,666
and our clockwork robots?

50
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,125
They seem incredibly
well made, kuma.

51
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,333
That's for sure!

52
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,958
And I can't imagine
what life would be like

53
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,916
if we didn't have these little
guys doing everything we asked!

54
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,083

bring me the book

must have broken him.

[BEASTMAN WORKER B] Hey!

Come give me a hand!

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,166
It... hates me.

60
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,666
I guess they don't
respond to humans.

61
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,208
They must be programmed
to respond only to beastmen.

62
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,500
Let's go.

63
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,958
Wait... Does that mean
the two of you are...

64
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,583

Who knew they'd play
into my hands this easily.

68
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,208
[GUARD ROBOT] The humans
have been spotted in town.

69
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,625
What are your orders?

70
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,208
[ALLIGATOR MASTER] I want

Yes, sir. Additionally...

two members of the

74

are requesting
entrance into to the city.

75
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,166
[ALLIGATOR MASTER]
Delay their entrance

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,791
for as long as possible.

Your top priority is to
bring me those humans at once!

Welcome travelers

I will be your guide
to our remarkable city.

00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,875
How may I be of service to you?

00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,250
We appreciate your

Before we begin,

86
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,958
I must first confirm
your identification.

87
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,333
What is the name
of your organization?

88

that the two humans have

a beastman companion
and now one of the

so I took specific precautions
to prevent it from happening.

141
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,416
I added an additional law
of robotics stipulating that

no robot shall
listen to any commands

from members of the bear tribe!

Don't call me
