[MORTE] So friggin' hot...
Oh my gods...

No stupid place...
should be this hot.

Did you expect...
something different...?

5
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:10,625
We are on...
the summer... continent...

00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:12,291
There are, kuma...

00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,000
are two kinds of
summers, kuma...

00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,250
[MORTE] Well spit it out then...

9
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:20,250
What are... the two
kinds of summers...? Huh?

10
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,583
[TOPPY] Uh... I don't
remember... kuma...

Do you know...
If... we're...

You three again?

[MORTE] Agan?

Why're you here? Are
you following us, kuma?

00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,583
I travel where the jobs
take me, so I'm here

00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,125
delivering medicine to the
charity hospital in town.

22
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,250
Charity hospital?

23
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,708
[AGAN] If you want,
I'd be happy to

24
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,583
give you guys a
lift into town...

25
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:59,291
Well... for the
right price I'd be happy.

Where am I?

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,750
Ah! Who are you?!

28
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,416
[ELEPHANT] Easy there
son. I don't want you

29
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
to get all worked up again.

30
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,625
You're quite safe here.
Don't worry, I'm the

31
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,166
director of this
charity hospital.

32
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,958
[MORTE] I can't imagine a
good reason why a beastman

33
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,541
would set up a
charity hospital.

34
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,916
[AGAN] Are you always
so incredibly negative?

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,291
That hospital director
is a kind soul who's

36
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,458
obviously done a lot for
the people of this village.

37
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,333
Sorry to have
kept you waiting.

38
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,083
How's Kyrie?

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,375
[TOPPY] Kyrie!

40
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,875
[KYRIE] Toppy...!
Morte...! Agan?

41
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:00,833
[TOPPY] Are you
feeling better...?

42
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,958
You really gave Morte
and me a scare, kuma!

43
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,291
[ELEPHANT] Your
friend here suffered from

44
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,250
a mild case of heat exhaustion.

45
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,375
It's not all that uncommon with
newcomers to our continent.

[KYRIE] Morte...

49
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,416
The real problem
with the patient is that

50
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,958
he's a pathetic weakling.

51
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,000
He simply has no
physical endurance.

52
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:32,875
[KYRIE] What?!

53
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,291
[ELEPHANT chuckles]

54
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,916
Well, I hope that all of
you learn from Kyrie's mistake

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,875
and start taking the summer
continent sun seriously.

56
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,666
I've got more deliveries
but remember if you're

57
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,375
gonna travel without water
at least do it at night...

58
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,833
See ya.

59
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,041
Does that guy ever
stop working, kuma?

60
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,583
[ELEPHANT] And what do the
two of you plan on doing?

61
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,958
You're welcome to
stay in this village

62
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,625
while your friend
here recuperates.

63

Please feel free to
make yourselves at home.

I have to admit that
I was pretty nervous,

00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,791
with it being my
first solo surgery and all

it went pretty well actually...

[CHILD] Hey you guys...!

68
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,333
It's rare to see a place
where humans and beastman

69
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,541
can live together
in such harmony, kuma.

70
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,416
I've only been here
for a short time,

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,083
but I've seen no
place like it...

72
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,125
Everyone that lives in
this village shares in

73
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,291
[MAN] the hospital director's
philosophy of peace and unity.

There's a bed for each of you.

If you need anything
else, just ask.

[TOPPY] I can't
remember the last time

81
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,708
I slept in a real bed, kuma!

00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,291
Hey, where did
you just come from?

Don't call him

[MAN] Sorry if
they bothered you.

88
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,500
They were just exicted
to make a new friend

89
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,708
to play with. You
see, they live here

in the hospital and
never get to leave...

91
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,458
Those three are orphans.

92
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,250
[MAN] Their families were
killed in the wars between

93
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,000
humans and beastman
and now live here

out of the hospital
director's kindness...

00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,750
"When it comes to
the preciousness of life,

human and beastmen
are the same."

97
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,083
That's the hospital
director's philosophy.

98
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,625
Seems he's quite the
noble optimist, kuma.

99
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,833
I wonder if the director
himself truly believes it.

100
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:29,541

it's just as I suspected.

00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,583
I was wondering
when you'd wake up...

159
00:09:56,666 --> 00:10:00,125
It's pretty foolish to be
traveling without any shade.

160
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,541
Oh well. It's
not like foreigners

161
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,791
ever know any better.

162
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,125
Pardon me sir, but
we are members of

163
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,666
the World
Salvation Committee.

164
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,708
[ICE CREAM MAN] I don't
know if that's supposed to

165
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,083
mean something to me...

166
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,291
Ha ha!

167
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,750
But it's you two who
needed the salvation,

168
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,750
which don't say
much of your committee.

169
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,458
I truly appreciate
your assistance

170
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:16,833
in our time of despair...

171
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,708
[LIA] But shut your beak
or I'll blow it right off!

172
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,666
[NADJA] Forgive her...
We came to your continent

173
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,916
in pursuit of the World
Destruction Committee.

174
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,333
[NADJA] You haven't seen any
of these individuals, perchance?

175
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,708
[ICE CREAM MAN] Well
sure! I've seen those three!

176
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,375
There are enough vegetable
sandwiches for everyone!

177
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,625
I really hope that
you all like them!

178
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:53,375
[cheering and laughing]

179
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,083
[ELEPHANT] I can't thank you
enough for all the great work

180
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,125
that you and your
friends have been doing.

181
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,291
The children have really
taken a liking to you,

182
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,750
[ELEPHANT] they're
having so much fun.

183
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,708
A world where humans
and beastmen could

184
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,583
live in harmony... It's
been my lifelong dream

185
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,291
[ELEPHANT] to make a world
like that into reality.

186
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,666
[MORTE] It's a
wonderful thought...

187
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,500
But I just cannot
believe a single word

188
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,208
that comes out of your mouth.

189
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,833
[GIRL] Doc Elephant!

190
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,250
[ANNE] You like it?
Aren't the flowers pretty?

191
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,333
Toppy made it for me himself!

192
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,291
Have a sandwich!
They are so delicious.

193
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,500
Kyrie made them
with fresh vegetables.

194
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,791
Come quick doc, before the
sandwiches are all gone!

195
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,375
Yeah. Follow me!

196
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,333
[chuckling] Alright
then. Coming!

197
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:39,541
[KIDS laughing and talking]

198
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,666
[MAN] Those are
most definitely them,

199
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,708
but they couldn't possibly be...

200
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,458
But they are. They're the
World Destruction Committee.

201
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,500
Sure they look like
them, but I can't imagine

202
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,916
any one of those good
people to be criminals.

203
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,041
Ugh! If you make excuses for
them, you're just a guilty--

204
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,708
Forgive us. We are still
not accustomed to the heat

205
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,041
and it seems to have
gone directly to her head.

206
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,291
Regardless...
we do not wish to cause

207
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,708
any trouble for you...

208
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,625
We're merely asking
you to be a good citizen

209
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,166
and hand over these criminals.

210
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,500
[ELEPHANT] Thank you
for waiting for me.

211
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,083
[MAN] Director...

212
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,458
I can take it
from here, Rigolet.

213
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,541
[ELEPHANT] Thank you for
entertaining our guests.

214
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,666
Uh. It's you...

215
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,166
Rigolet, you may
take leave now.

216
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,000
I truly appreciate you
taking care of them.

217
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,833
[RIGOLET] You're welcome,
director... Take care.

218
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,791
Would you both step
into my office to talk.

219
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,250
Kuma!

220
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:35,208
[BOY] Catch the ball with
your hands, not your face!

221
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,291
[NADJA] You are
him, aren't you?

222
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,708
[BOY] Rigolet!
Please throw us the ball!

223
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,041
A true legend...

224
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:44,833
Known only as "The King
of Desert Slaughter."

225
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,375
"The King of
Desert Slaughter."

226
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,125
It's been a very
long time since anyone

227
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,333
has known me
by that name.

228
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,750
[NADJA] So if
you went into hiding,

229
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,083
why open a charity hospital?

230
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,125
[BOY] Catch!

231
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,125
[ELEPHANT] To be honest, I
have a top secret experiment

232
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,625
that is currently underway.

233
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,708
Top secret?

234
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,458
[ELEPHANT] Yes.

235
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,875
[ELEPHANT] And that is why
I cannot consciously hand over

236
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,583
those three criminals to you.
So I need you to give me

237
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,375
a little more time
and then my research

238
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,416
will finally be complete!

239
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,041
Toppy.

240
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,958
[MORTE] Kyrie, wake up!
Toppy's gone missing.

241
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,041
Kyrie!

242
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,833
[MORTE] But why would
the kids be missing too?

243
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,833
[distant scraping]

244
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:15,291
[MORTE] That awful
sound... I knew it...

245
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,416
I knew that director
was hiding something...

246
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,583
[distant scraping]

247
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,875
[MORTE] The sound's
coming from in there...

248
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:35,125
[scraping]

249
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,500
Uh, Morte what's wrong?

250
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,875
[gasps]

251
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,333
Looks like the
jig's up you guys.

252
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,458
Jig is up?
What're you doing?

253
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,750
It's the middle of the night.

254
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,500
Well tomorrow is
Doc Elephant's bithday!

255
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,125
We've baked him
a big tasty cake

256
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,166
as a birthday surprise!

257
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,541
You two are adults!

258
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,708
I'd expect this
from kids but not you!

259
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:05,916
I'm going back to bed!

260
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,750
Wait, Morte. Sorry.
We didn't wake you

261
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,458
'cause we thought
you'd tattle.

262
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,333
Idiots!

263
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,958
[distant thud]

264
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,083
Rigolet!

265
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,375
[MORTE] Shouldn't
the director be untied

266
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,958
for his birthday party?

267
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,791
He can't blow out the candle.

268
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,041
[ELEPHANT] You're still here?!

269
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,958
You were supposed
to get away hours ago!

270
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,416
Get away?

271
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,416
Two agents from the
World Salvation Committee

272
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,500
came to the village
today looking for you.

273
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,541
[MORTE] You
sold us out the WSC?!

274
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,291
I made up a story
to get them to leave

275
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,125
and buy you all
enough time to escape.

276
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:52,416
That's why I sent word for you
three to get out of here...

277
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,541
You never gave them
the message, did you?

278
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,666
Why should I aide
known criminals?

279
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,583
The World Destruction
Committee deserves to be

280
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,500
locked away or even killed!

281
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:01,666
It was you!

282
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,125
You've been working
with them all along!

283
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,666
You're wrong! I've only
been working for myself.

284
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,541
Now get out! I need
to make sure that

285
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,625
when he dies he suffers
just like my family!

286
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,833
What are you talking about?

287
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,166
My life...!
This monster will feel

288
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,750
all the agony I've
lived with for years.

289
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,291
One fully sharpened knife

290
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,083
to cut great
big slices of cake!

291
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,333
[KIDS] Hooray!

292
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,583
Morte was pretty angry.

293
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,791
Think she'll go and
tell the director, kuma?

294
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,916
[KYRIE] She's not that spiteful,
but if you want, I'll check!

295
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,416
Be right back!

296
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,791
[RIGOLET] I've dedicated
my life to finding him

297
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,625
and enacting my revenge.

298
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,208
When I heard a beastman
who resembled him

299
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,583
was running a hospital,

300
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,916
I had to come find
out if it was the king.

301
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,083
The king?

302
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:46,458
At first, his façade
even had me fooled.

303
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,125
[RIGOLET] This beastman
who went out of his way

304
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,875
to do so much
good for people...

305
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,458
he couldn't possibly
be the monster

306
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,875
that I've been searching for.

307
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,500
But then today...

308
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,750
[RIGOLET] I overheard
your friends from the

309
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:02,333
World Salvation
Committee identify him...

310
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,125
And he confessed!

311
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,125
[RIGOLET] After
spending countless hours

312
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:10,458
convincing myself otherwise...

313
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:15,000
it turns out he was right
under my nose the entire time!

314
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,583
I've finally found you,

315
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,625
The King of Desert Slaughter!

316
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,166
What you say is true...

317
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,750
I was The King
of Desert Slaughter,

318
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,500
but I've dedicated the rest of
my life to atone for my sins.

319
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,375
But no amount of
atonement could ever

320
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,458
make up for all of the
suffering I have caused.

321

Atonement...?

322
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,791
That's why you started
this charity hospital.

323
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:38,583
Correct. To try and save as
many lives as I had taken away.

324
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,208
Do you honestly think
that your little hospital

325

can make up for
all that you've done?

You slaughtered
my entire village

my actions and then kill me...

[MORTE] So feel free
to kill him if you like.

My family was killed
in the fighting between

the beastmen
and humans as well.

346

the chance to fight back.

they could defeat the beastmen
