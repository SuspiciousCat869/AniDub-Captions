1
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,875
[KYRIE] There are two
kinds of companions...

2
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,583
Companions who are
bound to one another

3
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,375
through the
bonds of friendship...

4
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,750
and companions who waste
all of their time and energy

5
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,500
arguing when
it's really hot out

6
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:03,875
and they're sitting right
outside of an inn...

7
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:04,750
[MORTE] Will you
just give it a rest

8
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,208
and pipe down already, Toppy?!

9
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,666
How many times do I have
to repeat myself to you?

10
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,166
It's a human town;
there's no other option.

11
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,666
[TOPPY] I won't pretend to
be a stuffed animal, kuma!

12
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,125
Do you think I wanna
pretend to be walking around

13
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,500
with a stuffed
animal at my age?

14
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,250
No! But it's
what we have to do!

15
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,041
[TOPPY] It's against
everything I stand for.

16
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,083
I simply won't do it, kuma!

17
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,000
Fine, then we'll just
pretend Kyrie and I

18
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,708
are a couple and
you're our baby.

19
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:26,958
Kuma!

20
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,333
[MORTE] Perfect!
You're already crying and

21
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,208
carrying on like a wittle baby!

22
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,291
Can't we go inside? It's hot!

23
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,458
[TOPPY and MORTE arguing]

24
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,333
[INNKEEPER] Are you
three looking for a room?

25
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,833
[All] Hm?

26
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,625
[KYRIE] Well yes, we'd
love one if it's available,

27
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:43,958
but you see...

28
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,000
[chuckles] Your
friend is welcome.

29
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,583
I would go out of
business if I started

30
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,041
being choosy about my clientele.

31
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,375
[KYRIE] Are you serious?!
Thank you so much!

32
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,541
[TOPPY] Kuma!

33
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,000
I do hate to ask this but...

34
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,083
it's our policy to
collect payment first.

35
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,333
Sure!

36
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,791
[INNKEEPER] Splendid!
I'm glad that you three

37
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,000
turned out to be decent
travelers after all.

38
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,750
[KYRIE] What exactly
do you mean by that?

39
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,291
Well I don't want
to scare you off,

40
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,166
but I should warn you
that the World Destruction

41
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,333
Committee has been
terrorizing this area.

42
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,333
[KYRIE] Wha--?!

43
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,250
[BOTH] Uh.

44
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,625
Are you sure?

45
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,541
Yeah the word is that
they've been robbing people

46
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,333
and eating without paying. I
guess they're hard up for cash.

47
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,833
[KYRIE] That's... unbelievable?

48
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,958
Hm...

49
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,208
[WAITRESS] I hope you
folks are enjoying your meal

50
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,875
and I hate to ask again
but about the bill...

51
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,958
[MAN] Tell me, have you
ever asked yourself...

52
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,916
Why did the gods go
out of their way to place

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,250
the beastmen as well as
the humans within this world?

54
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,750
Huh?

55
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,458
[MAN] Some say they
were bitter after being

56
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,208
dumped by the goddesses.

57
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,875
Others say the gods accidentally
made two unique tribes

58
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,375
because they were
distracted by demons.

59
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,500
But this was no
accident, rather a message.

60
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,583
"Hark! Let all
beings live together

61
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,958
and let love
transcend the tribes!"

62
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,083
Love...! That is
what the gods have

63
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,458
truly intended for us!

64
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,375
To unite all tribes
through the power of love!

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,208
[MAN] All the tribes,
not just man and beastman...

66
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:22,291
but also the between
man and woman...

67
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,375
Speaking of which...

68
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,250
Seeing as how
you and I represent

69
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,333
the tribes of male and female...

70
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,083
I would love for us
to transcend together!

71
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,750
Uh... Huh?!

72
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,750
[MAN] Mmm. It's the
gods' will for us to

73
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,000
unleash the power of love!

74
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,291
[ALL gasp]

75
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,000
Ow! What'd you
do that for?

76
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,166
Couldn't you have
found a better way

77
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,958
to tell me that you
were getting jealous?

78
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,750
[WOMAN] You're making
an ass of yourself.

79
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,083
Let's get outta here.

80
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,375
[BEAR] Uh... Can you
guys please not fight here?

81
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,166
Hold on... What about your bill?

82
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,000
[MAN] This may
surprise you but I'm...

83
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,875
I'm none other
than the feared Kyrie

84
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,916
of the World
Destruction Committee!

85
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,500
And I'm Morte.

86
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,833
And that... makes me, Toppy.

87
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,125
[screaming]

88
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,208
Ha ha! I love to
hear the screaming!

89
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,000
Now... if any of you
so much as think about

90
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,166
going to the authorities,
we'll come back and give you

91
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,000
all something to
really scream about...

92
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,291
I hope I've made myself clear.

93
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,750
[MAN] Ciao!

94
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,208
[GIRL] Ahhh!

95
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,750
Uh... Huh?

96
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,750
I-I didn't mean to...

97
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,666
[screaming]

98
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,333
I'm sorry. Are you
okay little girl?

99
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:44,208
[GIRL] Yep.

100
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,458
It's time to leave.

101
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:46,625
Right.

102
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,416
[MAN] How much
longer will it be...

103
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,041
before we reach the new world?

104
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,250
[GIRL chuckles]

105
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,083
[heavy exhales]

106
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,541
[TOPPY] Kuma!

107
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,416
After you rest up, we're
starting interrogations

108
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,875
immediately, kuma!

109
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,625
Are you still
going on about that?

110
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,208
If these imposters
want the attention

111
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,750
and can get the World
Salvation Committee

112
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,541
off our backs,
it's a win-win.

113
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,250
How can you say that, kuma?

114
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,500
I, for one, cannot stand
here and let some petty thief

115
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,291
drag my name
through the mud, kuma!

116
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,291
If that's what you're concerned
about, you're a little late.

117
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,791
Toppy, it would be
really nice if you just

118
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,500
stayed here with
us and relaxed.

119
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,041
[KYRIE] Especially after
they were nice enough to

120
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,791
bring that special
bed in for you.

121
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,375
Besides, you'd stick
out like a sore thumb

122
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,291
if you went
investigating in town.

123
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,375
So you'll take the fall for
a friend and be associated

124
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,500
with stealing gambling money
but not the ol' dine and dash?

125
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,958
Fine then, kuma!

126
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,041
I just investigate
by myself, kuma!

127
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,416
Toppy!

128
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,000
[KYRIE] Just stop and
think about for a second...

129
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,041
[BOTH stutter] Ahhh!

130
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,125
[door shuts]

131
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,291
Get off!

132
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,500
Sorry, Morte.

133
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,000
What's wrong?

134
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,666
Uh...

135
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,083
Nothing...

136
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,833
[KYRIE] Oh man. How do you
tell a woman that already

137
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,750
wants to kill you that
you tore her clothes?

138
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,375
[RESTAURANT OWNER] I'm not
telling you people anything

139
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,291
until you buy enough
food to compensate me

140
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,666
for what they ate and
the damage they caused.

141
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,000
Besides if the World
Salvation Committee

142
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,250
had done their jobs, none of
this would've ever happened.

143
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,625
Watch your tongue, human!

144
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,250
The World Salvation
Committee is saving you

145
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,541
from extinction and you
dare to think we owe you?

146
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,875
No, I just meant that...

147
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,708
How often must I tell you
not to use intimidation?

148
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,750
Pardon me Nadja, but
I've had it with your rules.

149
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,750
It's not as if any of your
calculations have brought

150
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,125
the World Destruction
Committee into custody.

151
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,541
Sorry you feel that
way but I disagree.

152
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,125
My calculations
have been perfect

153
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,458
yet lady luck hasn't
been on our side.

154
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,166
[NADJA] But our time to strike
seems to be soon upon us.

155
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,958
And looks like we're
having a meal until then.

156
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,916
[LIA grunts]

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,916
One of everything they ate
for our special patrons.

158
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,250
[NADJA] Now your part.

159
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,875
I heard they'd stolen a
number of priceless items

160
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,875
from an antique
store in the next town.

161
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,125
[NADJA] In the next town?

162
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,583
That's right. The one
at the top of that hill.

163
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,208
[RESTAURANT OWNER] It's
a beastman town so I rarely

164
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,375
make it up there. If you
look close enough, though,

165
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,250
you can probably see it.

166
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,750
We have to walk
all the way up there?

167
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,625
I hope you're hungry.

168
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,291
[OLD COP] Ahhh!

169
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,958
Beastmen sure do
come in all shapes and sizes.

170
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,916
I've been the sheriff
of this town for many years

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,750
and you certainly are the
tiniest fellow I've ever seen.

172
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,625
I'll take that as a
compliment and thank you

173
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,625
for your years of
devoted service.

174
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,666
Now can you describe
the criminal activities

175
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,750
of the World Destruction
Committee, kuma?

176
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,125
Well... there's not
much except some robberies

177
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,625
and eating without paying.
Save for an incident

178
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,625
in the next town where someone
was injured in a robbery.

179
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,791
[TOPPY] These fiends
disgust me, kuma.

180
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,041
[OLD COP] Looks to me like every
restaurant and antique shop

181
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,666
in the area's been knocked
over by these criminals...

182
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,458
Just today they
walked out on their bill

183
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,916
and terrorized patrons
at a restaurant near here.

184
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,416
[TOPPY] How long ago?

185
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,583
[OLD COP] Hm...
A few hours back,

186
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,416
so I'm calling witnesses...

187
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,166
[GIRL] Oh wow! This time
it's a teeny tiny bear! Yay!

188
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,666
[TOPPY] Put me down, kuma!

189
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,000
Don't call me
a bear, kuma.

190
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,833
[GIRL] Mr. Policeman,
I don't get it.

191
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,875
Why doesn't he wanna
be called a bear?

192
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,708
[OLD COP] Maya put
the little bear down.

193
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,541
Can't you see he doesn't
like to be handled like that?

194
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,750
Maya, I need
your help.

195
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,625
Can you be my star
witness and tell me

196
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,375
what happened at
the restaurant?

197
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,583
Mm! Yes, sir!

198
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,125
The bear was way
bigger than this one

199
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,291
and his name was
Toppy and he was

200
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,791
really nice and
said he was sorry.

201
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,666
He...
said he was sorry?

202
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,250
He just looked really scary
'cause he was super huge

203
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,416
but he was actually nice
and apologized just to me!

204
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,708
I'm not a bear, kuma.

205
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,208
[MORTE] Kyrie, look how
intricate this painting is...

206
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,666
I think it's an original.

207
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,666
[KYRIE] Oh wow... So deep...

208
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,708
Just keep looking at how
pretty and intricate it is.

209
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,166
[KYRIE nervous screaming]

210
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,125
You okay?

211
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,291
Needed some fresh air.

212
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,916
[KYRIE] Is that a...

213
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,791
[KYRIE] Hey Morte!
You gotta see this.

214
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,916
Come on...
Look at that building.

215
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,541
Maybe we could go together.

216
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,333
[MORTE] Huh? Go where?

217
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,541
The one across the
way with the chimney.

218
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,041
It looks like it's
the town bathhouse.

219
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,125
[trembling] Uh...

220
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,916
So how's about you and
I go and relax together, Morte!

221
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,250
Bathe together?

222
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,708
[KYRIE] Uh... I just meant...
What I meant to say was...

223
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:51,916
[NADJA] What happened next?

224
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,416
After that... the shop
owner put up quite a fight.

225
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,041
But he was no
match for all three

226
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,000
and received
near-fatal injuries.

227
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,041
[DOG COP] This is
where he went down.

228
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,916
[DOG COP] That poor man
never would have suffered

229
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,833
if you folks from the
World Salvation Committee

230
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,541
could keep tabs on your perps.

231
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,000
Shut your face or I'll...

232
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,750
Uh... Are you
two doin' okay?

233
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,750
We'll be fine once we
apprehend these criminals,

234
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,000
so it's pertinent
that you give us

235
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,000
all the information you have.

236
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:19,750
[NADJA] So officer...
what leads can you... pass on?

237
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,291
Well... a report came through
that placed your burglars

238
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,000
hitting more antique stores
in the next town over.

239
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,458
[BOTH] Next town... over?

240
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,208
[DOG COP] Yeah. Once
you make it over those two

241
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,500
mountain peaks it's
right on the other side.

242
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,958
[BOTH groan]

243
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,083
[DOG COP] It should
only take a day or two.

244
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,458
[BOTH sigh]

245
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:54,125
[distant dog barking]

246
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:12,208
[chatter]

247
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,708
[TOPPY] So the intel
I've gathered points to

248
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,250
our imposters
committing crimes of

249
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,958
circumstance
with the restaurants.

250
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,541
Yet their specialty seems
to be antiques robbery, kuma.

251
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,458
And according to
the eyewitness testimony of

252
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,916
a little girl there's
a beastman who...

253
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
[grunts]

254
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,750
[TOPPY] Have you even listened
to a word I've said, kuma?

255
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,750
Sorry what
little girl now?

256
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,416
[TOPPY] Our reputations
are on the line here!

257
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
The least you could
do is just listen, kuma.

258
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,166
Can't you two take this the
least bit seriously, kuma?

259
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,250
Nope.

260
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,416
[KYRIE] Sorry Toppy, but
I have bigger problems now.

261
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,000
Do you see it?

262
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,916
Uh... What am I looking at?

263
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,708
[KYRIE] At Morte! Don't tell
me you can't see it, Toppy!

264
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,958
Just look... at her thigh...

265
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,583
Kuma!

266
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,000
Morte is going to
absolutely freak out

267
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,500
and take it
out on us, kuma!

268
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,125
Why us when it's
all your fault?

269
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,333
My fault? I never
touched her thigh, kuma!

270
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,291
If you hadn't pushed
me down on top her...

271
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,458
[MORTE] What are you
guys talking about?

272
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,000
[BOTH] Kuma!

273
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,458
Hm...

274
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,750
[BOTH nervously laugh]

275
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,291
[MORTE] What's with you guys?

276
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,833
How might I help you?

277
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,416
[MAN] We've heard
great things about this inn

278
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,125
and would like a
room for the night.

279
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,041
Sure. First,
I'm sorry, but I must

280
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,500
ask for payment in
advance. It's our policy.

281
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,291
[MAN] It seems that our
path to the new world will

282
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,958
continue to be long and steep.

283
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,166
[YAMATO] You may be
surprised to hear this,

284
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,291
but the dreaded World
Destruction Committee is right--

285
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,416
Sorry to interrupt...

286
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,208
but I have some
questions for you.

287
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,666
Ugh...

288
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,541
[MAN] The World
Destruction Committee is...

289
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,750
is right over
there and we're just

290
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,833
innocent citizens
so protect us!

291
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,416
[ALL THREE] Huh?

292
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,958
[BOTH] Ahhh!

293
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,125
[MAN] Those three are
obviously the World Destruction

294
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,333
Committee and they're trying
to bring our world to an end.

295
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,250
[OLD COP] You
mean they're here?

296
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,958
[TOPPY] Uh...

297
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,000
[OLD COP] You're that
little feller from earlier.

298
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,375
I knew there was
somethin' odd about you.

299
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,458
Figures someone
that ridiculously puny

300
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,041
was just up to no good.

301
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,833
Ridiculously punny?!

302
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,583
Quiet!

303
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,375
Fool me once,
shame on you!

304
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,166
I may be old but I won't
be fooled twice, so confess!

305
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,916
[TOPPY] Now hold on, kuma!

306
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,708
We both heard that
little girl's statement

307
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,625
and she said that bear was
much bigger than me, kuma!

308
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,583
Yes, sir! The bear was
way bigger than this one

309
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:33,791
and his name was
Toppy and he was

310
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,166
really nice and
said he was sorry.

311
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,708
Yeah. You're right.

312
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,750
Glad you
remember, kuma.

313
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,583
[OLD COP] "The bear
was way bigger," huh?

314
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:44,458
Huh?

315
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,916
Hold on!

316
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,833
A master crime-solver
like yourself shouldn't be

317
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,708
so easily swayed by trickery!

318
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,375
Look... Gaze upon my injury!

319
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,125
This vertically
challenged bear told me

320
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,791
he was with the World
Destruction Committee.

321
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,041
Then he attacked me relentlessly
and without warning.

322
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,666
[TOPPY] Vertically challenged?!

323
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,500
See, he doesn't
deny a thing!

324
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,541
Not when they're
blatant lies, kuma!

325
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,416
Hmmm.

326
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:15,250
Quiet! Both of you back
away from one another slowly!

327
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,833
[OLD COP] Then all of
you up against the wall!

328
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,250
I'm interrogating
both of your groups!

329
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,000
[OLD COP] Now...
According to the reports,

330
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,875
this World Destruction Committee
is a trio consisting of

331
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,208
one human man and woman,
and a beastman bear.

332
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,291
The man's supposed
to be scrawny.

333
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,583
Scrawny? Sir, would
you describe my

334
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,875
bulging muscles
as scrawny?

335
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,333
Hmph.

336
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,833
[OLD COP] The woman...
strikingly beautiful.

337
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,750
[OLD COP] Hmmm...

338
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:04,083
And the last one is a
vicious-lookin' beastman.

339
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,000
[TOPPY] Kuma!

340
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,125
[OLD COP] Vicious looking?

341
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:11,875
[BEAR] Just because
I'm a big guy

342
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,458
doesn't mean that I'm vicious!

343
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,041
Hmmm.

344
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,083
Eyewitnesses from a
restaurant where they

345
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,500
ate without paying their bill

346
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,541
said that this trio bickered
and fought all the time.

347
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,958
Bickering and
fighting, why then that

348
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,416
couldn't possibly be us!

349
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,333
There's nothing we hate more
than fighting, right guys?

350
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:42,708
[KYRIE chuckling]

351
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,166
Ahhh!

352
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:49,583
Huh?

353
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:50,833
[growl]

354
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,750
What now?

355
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,416
Forgive me, kuma.

356
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,500
[MORTE] Huh?

357
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,791
[TOPPY struggling]

358
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,166
[OLD COP] Good grief.
What's next?

359
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,500
Now, about the woman...

360
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,083
While they were all
fighting, she threw the man

361
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,000
in her group halfway
cross the restaurant

362
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,333
with a considerably
un-lady-like strength.

363
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,041
Sounds to me like
she's prone to some

364
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,166
rather violent tendencies.

365
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,416
[MAN] She has gentle
and lady-like grace to her

366
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,541
without a hint of violence.

367
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,000
[nervous chuckles]

368
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,458
Right... Well
now it's my turn.

369
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,125
[KYRIE] Okay, that's
good enough Morte!

370
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,166
Don't bend over so far!

371
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:46,583
[fabric tearing]

372
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,875
[MORTE shaky breathing]

373
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,375
[MORTE] You knew about this?

374
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,250
[KYRIE and TOPPY trembling]

375
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,500
You both knew
about it, didn't you?

376
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,875
Uh... lady-like grace, right?

377
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,125
[MORTE] How's this
for lady-like grace!

378
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,083
Well that
narrows it down.

379
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,750
[OLD COP] Hmmm...

380
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,333
[MAN] The evil has fallen.

381
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,958
So the time has
come for us to depart.

382
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,583
Halt, kuma!

383
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,000
[BEAR] I'm sorry.

384
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:37,000
But we... we cannot allow
ourselves to be captured.

385
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,625
We're are too far
along our journey

386
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,666
to discovering the new
world where all humans

387
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,583
and beastmen can
coexist peacefully.

388
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,000
We're leaving.

389
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,250
I truly am sorry.

390
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:51,625
Don't move!

391
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,708
[MAN] Uh. What is it now?

392
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,708
How do you explain this?
Some of these paintings

393
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,458
[OLD COP] are the very
ones reported missing from

394
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,958
that antique shop
in the next town over!

395
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,375
And these
vases... Also stolen!

396
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,416
Ahhh. You folks have
some explaining to do.

397
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,166
[growl]

398
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,291
[growl]

399
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,916
It's real?!

400
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,000
[BOTH chuckle]
[BEAR growls]

401
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,833
[OLD COP] One human
man, one human woman,

402
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,666
and a beastman bear?!
It was you all along?!

403
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,083
[chuckles] Don't
give us all the credit!

404
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,750
We certainly robbed
those antique stores

405
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,750
for things of value
but eating without paying

406
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,625
really isn't our style.

407
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,083
But looks like
it's your lucky day

408
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,958
'cause I'm fairly
certain the ones guilty

409
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,708
of those crimes
are right there...

410
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,291
[BIG BEAR]
Does it really matter?

411
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,875
Now that they
all know the truth

412
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,583
we can't exactly let them live!

413
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,083
Save me!

414
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,250
If you're going to
cower, can you please

415
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,833
watch where
your hands go?

416
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,416
[INNKEEPER and WIFE chuckle]

417
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
Let go of me already.

418
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,041
[INNKEEPER and WIFE chuckle]

419
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,333
Honey Bunny!

420
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,083
[groans]

421
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:12,875
[grunts]

422
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,625
So we've wasted all
this time looking around...

423
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,208
And they were right here!

424
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,625
Oh no you don't!

425
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,541
[BEAR] Oh my god!
We're all gonna die!

426
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,750
This would be an
excellent time to escape.

427
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,625
I'm not really sure I can.

428
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,041
I can't seem to move.

429
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,583
Moron.

430
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,125
[TOPPY] Hey, you! Imposters!

431
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,625
This way, kuma!

432
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,083
[TOPPY] It's not safe, kuma!

433
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:48,291
[LIA screaming distantly]

434
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,750
You could at least
try to carry me with

435
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,291
a little of that lady-like
grace that I vouched for?

436
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,125
Would you stop
arguing and run!

437
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,916
[KYRIE] It doesn't seem like
anyone's following us, but...

438
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,458
I am so very sorry!

439
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,041
I am sorry as well.

440
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,458
Ditto.

441
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,500
You will properly
compensate every restaurant.

442
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,625
And you will take over
management of that inn, kuma.

443
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,833
Your penance for tarnishing
a hero's name, kuma.

444
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,000
Um... Paying for what
we ate is one thing...

445
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,375
but why have
us running the inn?

446
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,375
[TOPPY] To create a place
where humans and beastmen

447
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,708
co-exist peacefully, kuma.

448
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,916
The new world
isn't some far off place.

449
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,208
It's wherever
you make it, kuma.

450
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,208
Oh! Thank you
so very much!

451
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,791
"The new world
isn't a far off place

452
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,250
but wherever you make it?"

453
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,625
Wow! It sounds
like something that

454
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,416
I would have come up with.

455
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,250
I think it's about time
that Toppy and I got going.

456
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,208
[FEMALE] You've helped us
more than you will ever know.

457
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,291
Uh... Before you two
run off, I must impart you

458
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,583
with advice of my own.

459
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,125
Take this from
someone who knows,

460
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:05,666
never anger a woman because
no good can ever come from it!

461
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,000
[MAN] Besides, by the
time you apologize to her,

462
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,750
it's generally too late.

463
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,083
[BOTH] Huh?

464
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:15,250
[MAN] Good night and
good luck! We're outta here!

[KYRIE and TOPPY yell]

00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:04,041
[KYRIE] What's that?!

469
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,583
[TOPPY] It's a
sand whale, kuma!

[ALL] Kuma!

471
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:08,500
[MORTE] We find ourselves
stranded in the middle of

00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:10,916
the Sand Sea and we are
once again rescued by Agan!

[KYRIE] What's that?!

474
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:13,250
[TOPPY] It's a subarenine, kuma!

475
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:14,750
[ALL] Kuma!

476
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,583
[MORTE] The four of us are
captured and taken along with

477
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,791
Agan's cargo aboard
the subarenine as it

478
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,500
dives deep into the Sand Sea!

479
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,541
How are we supposed
to get out of this mess?

480
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:24,541
Next time on
Sands of Destruction,

481
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:26,333
"There Are Two
Kinds of Smugglers."

482
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:28,833
[KYRIE] What's that?! A sound's
coming from that cargo!

483
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:32,083
[TOPPY] Don't worry, it just
sounds like some ticking. Kuma?
