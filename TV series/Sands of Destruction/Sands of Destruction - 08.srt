Not yet. The engine
still isn't responding.

Any chance at

during that explosion.

Are you trying to tell me
we're trapped at the bottom

If we don't come up
with some kind of plan soon,

00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,000
the weight of that sand
is going to crush us, kuma!

who we are, you're dead!

there's no one who could

less do anything to help.

What do you mean by that?

217
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,416
The subarenine is a
fairly recent development

218
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,708
created by the
Clock Town engineers.

219

Why don't we just swim out?

That's the absolute
dumbest thing I've ever heard!

00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,333
We're under millions
of tons of sand.

224
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,708
We'd all be crushed the
second we opened the door.

225
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,291
Still... there must
be something we can do.

226
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,375
I think it's safe to assume
that none of us want to

227
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,708
die down here, so why don't
we call a truce alright.

228
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,833
Isn't there any way
to escape, like an

something like
this ever happened.

234
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,125
I wonder how far away
from the surface we are.

235
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,916
I bet we can make it up to
the top if we hold our breath!

Oh! Toppy, why don't
you hold on to my neck

237
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,541
and breathe into my
mouth like you did before,

238
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,083
and that way I'll have enough
air to get to the surface!

239
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,791
You are not using me
as an oxygen tank, kuma!

Wait! I've got an
even better idea!

00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,625
We'll grab that toilet bowl
I can use it as a helmet

242
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,125
and there'll be some air
trapped inside so I can

243
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:02,333
breathe normally all the way
to the top! It's foolproof!

244
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,708
I already told you
you'd be crushed

245
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,166

opened the hatch!

246

Are you that stupid
or are you deaf?!

Uh. I'm sorry...
I didn't mean it.

[NADJA] The cabin where
the explosion occurred is in

249
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,000
the stern of the ship, but
the bow, where the engine

250

is located, didn't
sustain any damage at all.

00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,250
So if the controls
are the only thing

00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,083
preventing us from
being able to surface...

253
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,708
then our best bet
would be finding the
