1
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,500
[KYRIE] There are
two kinds of humans.

2
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,291
Those who look
good with fake ears on

3
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,500
and those who look
like complete fools.

4
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:07,875
Hey! Don't you mock me!

5
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,125
And besides you're not
even saying it right, kuma.

6
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,625
No one cares, Toppy...

7
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,416
I just want to know
why I have to wear them.

8
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,375
They're so stupid.

9
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:18,083
[KYRIE] Because
this is a beastmen town.

10
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,625
[KYRIE] And because
a good disguise

11
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,458
will ensure your safety.

12
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,041
[grunts]

13
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,375
[KYRIE] Actually those fake ears
look pretty good on you, Morte.

14
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,916
In fact, I think
it's such a good look,

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,083
you should consider working
it into your everyday wardrobe.

16
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,875
[TOPPY] Oh please.
It's not right for her

17
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,625
to wear those things, kuma.

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,166
[LIA] Nadja, are you sure
the spring continent is

19
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,333
the right place for
us to be looking...?

20
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,375
I realize it's the
closest continent to Bonak

21
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:46,291
but it doesn't seem like
the logical place to go.

22
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,250
[NADJA] Normally a group
would steer clear of

23
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,833
the spring continent
and head straight for

24
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,291
the summer or
fall continent instead.

25
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,791
But that trio is
craftier than most people.

26
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,583
[NADJA] I think they assumed
we'd expect them to do

27
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,375
the opposite of the opposite
of what we'd normally expect,

28
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,958
meaning they did
the opposite of that.

29
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,458
I think you're
over-analyzing this a bit...

30
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,041
If I can speak frankly,
I honestly don't think

31
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,375
[LIA] they're as intelligent
as you make them sound.

32
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,833
Even if they're
not smart enough to

33
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,208
come up with that plan...

34
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,041
[NADJA] there's still...

35
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,291
the will of the Destruct Code.

36
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:29,375
[chatter]

37
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,208
[TOPPY] Well then,
what's the plan?

38
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,166
Where are we headed, kuma?

39
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,750
And where exactly
do we plan to be

40
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,625
at the end of our journey, kuma?

41
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,083
I already told you...

42
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,250
[MORTE] Everything I know
is within the Destruct Code.

43
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,125
It alone, is the only
thing that can lead us

44
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,000
to the path of
world destruction.

45
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,041
[TOPPY] So what you're saying
is all the trouble we've

46
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,333
been through recently
can be traced back...

47
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,583
to the guidance of
that stupid ball, kuma?

48
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,958
[grunt]

49
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,166
Look at it this way, at
least we made the right call

50
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,041
coming to the
spring continent...

51
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,083
I mean, if you have to travel,
you can't find anywhere

52
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,791
in the world that's as
warm and tranquil as this.

53
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,625
What are you acting
so laid back for...?

54
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,750
Have you forgotten the
fact that we're fugitives?

55
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,208
[TOPPY] And the only
reason that's true

56
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,375
is because of you, kuma!

57
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,458
I was saying...
I've always been told the

58
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:16,916
spring continent is the place
to go to see cherry trees.

59
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,250
But I... haven't
seen even one yet...

60
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,708
I was hoping the
three of us could

61
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,875
have a nice picnic
under one of them.

62
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,458
 Excuse me folks.
Are you traveling beastmen?

63
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,500
[KYRIE] Oh!
Why yes, sir. We are!

64
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,791
[OLD FROG] Unfortunately
all the cherry trees

65
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,666
in this town
have been removed.

66
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,791
Huh?

67
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:41,875
[OLD FROG] Cherry
trees are known to

68
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,625
suck the lifeblood of beastmen,

69
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,416
and use it to make
their flowers bloom.

70
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,916
It's an old
legend that continues

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,541
to live on in this town.

72
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,500
It's just
superstition, kuma...

73
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,208
Back where I'm from
we had a saying that

74
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,500
the ground beneath a
cherry tree in full bloom

75
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,333
was filled with the
bodies of beastmen, kuma.

76
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,166
That's true but it's just
something people say...

77
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,750
And believe me,
no one around here

78
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,625
ever took these legends
to actually be fact.

79
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,458
But then... the Frog Master
became Lord of the town

80
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,833
and started
spreading the word that

81
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,041
cherry trees were
unlucky for society,

82
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,666
so he ordered them
all to be cut down.

83
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,916
Mmm.

84
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,333
[FROG MINION] My Lord!

85
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,666
We have just
received word that

86
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,583
the World Salvation
Committee will be arriving

87
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,958
to port tonight in Vito.

88
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,125
[FROG MINION] They
will be heading here

89
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,333
early tomorrow morning.

90
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,291
The World Salvation
Committee, eh?

91
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,416
[FROG MASTER]
I would rather them not

92
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,291
stir up trouble
in my territory.

93
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,208
[KYRIE] Man, I really
had my hopes up

94
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,916
for a picnic under
the cherry trees.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,666
How many times do
I have to tell you?

96
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,791
We're not here to
gaze at all the flowers.

97
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,458
Hm...?

98
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,458
[MORTE] What the--?
What's wrong with you?

99
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,666
[KYRIE] Look!

100
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,791
Uh...

101
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,333
Cherry blossom!

102
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,791
[TOPPY] Over here, kuma!

103
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:25,125
[chuckles]

104
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,291
[TOPPY] What's
this one doing here

105
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,250
when all the others
were cut down, kuma?

106
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,625
[KYRIE] Who cares? Besides,
the important thing is that

107
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,875
we can have our picnic now!

108
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,000
[KYRIE] Oh come on, Morte.
Stop making that face, will ya?

109
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,750
Let's try to have
some fun for a change?

110
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,166
[KYRIE] I mean, think
about it for a second.

111
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,750
The only reason we're
on the spring continent

112
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,041
is because the Destruct
Code led us here.

113
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,875
And you never know, the
Destruct Code just might

114
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,250
have a thing for cherry
blossoms like I do.

115
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,333
[MORTE] I seriously doubt that.

116
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:54,583
So this sucks the lifeblood
from beastmen, kuma?

117
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,958
[TOPPY] That's impossible.
It's just a wives-tale, kuma.

118
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,416
[screams]

119
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,541
[KYRIE laughing]

120
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,875
No way! Did I
actually scare you, Toppy?

121
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,791
I ain't scared
of nothing, kuma...!

122
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,125
Now stop playing
games up there, kuma!

123
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,583
[KYRIE] Ow! Ahhh! 

124
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:13,041
Oh man. I hope
I didn't make it angry!

125
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,291
[TOPPY] Get away
from me with that, kuma.

126
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,500
[gasp]

127
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,416
[FROG CITIZEN]
What have you done?!

128
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,916
Now's when you fess up and
tell him what you did, kuma.

129
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,666
Yeah, I suppose
your right.

130
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,416
[KYRIE] I'm sorry
but I broke this branch!

131
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,666
It was an accident!

132
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,208
Oh... bye.

133
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:39,458
[gasping]

134
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,958
Heh. Hi...

135
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,416
[KYRIE] I kinda broke this.

136
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,958
Huh... That's
enough truth, kuma.

137
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,791
Something's not quite
right in this town, kuma.

138
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,541
[TOPPY] I say we hurry
up, get what we need,

139
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,083
and bug outta here, kuma.

140
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,250
[KYRIE] Yeah.

141
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,625
[birds cawing]

142
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,250
A human?

143
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,750
Wait... Who're you?

144
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,916
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to frighten you.

145
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,458
But I made a promise
to someone that

146
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,000
I would meet them here
under the cherry tree.

147
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,875
What the heck's
going on here, kuma?

148
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,000
It's just a guess but
maybe everyone actually

149
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,583
believes that tree sucks
away their lifeblood.

150
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,708
Hey, look over there.

151
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,416
It looks like
they're still open.

152
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,000
[KYRIE] Excuse me, do you
have any food for sale?

153
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,958
[FROG CITIZEN]
Ahhh! Stay away from me!

154
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,000
[AGAN] Right this way!

155
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,250
[chuckles]

156
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,833
[AGAN] I've got a wide
selection of rare foods

157
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,250
from around the globe.

158
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,416
[KYRIE] It's you!

159
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,541
[TOPPY] Agan
the smuggler, kuma?!

160
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,500
So we meet again.
Who'da thunk it?

161
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,000
I guess since you're
here you were able to

162
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,791
escape from the pleasure
ship in one piece.

163
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,750
No way! Is that a
branch from the cherry tree?

164
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,541
The last one standing in town?

165
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:13,625
[KYRIE] It sure is.

166
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:14,666
[AGAN gasp]

167
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,750
You know something
about it, kuma?

168
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,041
[KYRIE] Yeah what's the big
deal with this thing anyway...?

169
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,291
Everyone runs off all
frantic the minute they see it.

170
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:25,041
[AGAN] So you're the one
that broke the branch off?

171
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,333
Yeah... I was
climbing the tree...

172
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,958
I mean it was just
an accident, you know.

173
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,041
That tree's got a name.

174
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,625
It's called the
Cursed Cherry Tree,

175
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,625
and every single beastman in
town is scared to death of it.

176
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,541
[TOPPY] The Cursed Cherry Tree?

177
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,250
Right. Apparently anyone
who tries to cut it down

178
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,541
or break off a branch
or harm it in any way

179
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,500
will be cursed with
one unfortunate event

180
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,791
after another
until the end of time.

181
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,166
[AGAN] That's why it
is the only cherry tree

182
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,541
left standing in
the entire village.

183
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:55,166
No one dares try to cut
it down or even go near it.

184
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,208
Why didn't anyone
tell us about this curse?

185
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,458
Oh don't take it
so seriously, kuma.

186
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,375
It's just one of those silly
local legends, right, kuma?

187
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,000
[chuckles]

188
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,833
Well... Personally I
think it's all a crock.

189
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,041
[AGAN] If it's food
you're looking for

190
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,250
it's right over there.

191
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,708
[KYRIE] Oh, thanks!

192
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,750
But I'm sure you've heard
the saying before yourself.

193
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,708
There's no smoke
without fire...

194
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,583
It wouldn't hurt
to be careful, right?

195
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,000
That's not a bad idea.
As long as we're cautious...

196
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:24,250
[KYRIE] Ahhh!

197
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,375
[TOPPY grunting]
[KYRIE struggling]

198
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,833
[KYRIE] Help!
Help me! Toppy, please!

199
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,333
[KYRIE] We're in
big trouble, Morte!

200
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,500
We found out this
cherry tree is cursed!

201
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,708
What do you think we should do?

202
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,208
Huh?

203
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,833
I... just... told you...!

204
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,125
The tree is cursed meaning
anyone who breaks off a branch

205
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,833
like I did, will have a
curse set upon them for life!

206
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,791
Oh... kay...

207
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,500
[KYRIE panicking]
[TOPPY shudders]

208
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,166
We're getting sucked in
deeper and deeper, kuma!

209
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,750
You don't have to get
all worked up about it.

210
00:10:58,833 --> 00:10:59,666
[KYRIE] Huh?

211
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,041
Who is this guy?

212
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,083
The name's Jade. And
it's a pleasure to meet you.

213
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,250
I live in the
forest near here.

214
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,958
In case you're wondering
I'm the one who

215
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,875
spread the rumor throughout
town about the curse.

216
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,375
[JADE] It's just a
made up story so you can

217
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,041
rest assured you'll be fine.

218
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,166
Trust me, you're
anything but cursed.

219
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,916
Why would you go
around spreading rumors

220
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and conjecture like that, kuma?

221
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,708
In order to protect this tree...

222
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,291
[JADE] from the
axes of the beastmen.

223
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,166
[LIA] Excuse me, human. We
have some questions for you.

224
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,125
Sorry. Do I know you two?

225
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,708
It's unlikely. We are with
the World Salvation Committee.

226
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,250
Tell me, have you
seen any members of

227
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,541
the World Destruction
Committee lately?

228
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,833
[AGAN] If you want
information from me

229
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,833
you're gonna
have to pay for it...

230
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,125
Or you can buy something.
Doesn't matter to me.

231
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,833
Do you have even
the faintest idea

232
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,083
who it is you are speaking to?

233
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,666
Okay... One dried
sand shark fin.

234
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,583
We'll take it to
go and, of course...

235
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,583
[NADJA] you can keep the change.

236
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,541
Now that you mention it
I did run into them here.

237
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,625
But you may want to think twice
about getting close to them...

238
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,333
See those fools
broke a branch off

239
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,208
the cursed cherry tree.

240
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,416
Cursed cherry tree?

241
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,708
Yup. And if you don't
tread carefully you may

242
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,958
wind up getting some of their
bad luck rubbed off on you.

243
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:18,958
[gasp]

244
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,541
I'm not too
concerned about it.

245
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,166
Curses, bad luck, and all these
other unscientific theories

246
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,208
are simply cheap fiction
used to scare the ignorant.

247
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,083
[JADE] Well, you see
the truth is I promised to

248
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,583
meet someone under this same
cherry tree some time ago.

249
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,708
[TOPPY] A woman, kuma?

250
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,833
Yes. It was my fiancé.

251
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,250
Many years ago we lived
quietly in a little village

252
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,333
on the outskirts of Bonak.

253
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,041
But then one day
the beastmen came

254
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,791
and set fire to
our whole village.

255
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,416
[JADE] All of the
men from my village

256
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,375
fought bravely to save it,

257
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:55,541
but we had no hope of
defeating the beastmen.

258
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,750
So just before the final charge,

259
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,500
the two of us made a promise,

260
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,583
that if we both
made it out alive,

261
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,708
we would make our way
to the spring continent

262
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,625
and meet on a hill outside
of a town near water...

263
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,166
underneath a
beautiful cherry tree.

264
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,708
What then...?

265
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,291
Were you able to reunite with
your girlfriend after all?

266
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,958
[JADE] 'Fraid not. And
that is exactly why I can

267
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,708
never allow this
cherry tree to disappear.

268
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,750
[KYRIE crying]

269
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,750
But... today was a new day...

270
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,541
and I will continue
to wait for her.

271
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,708
[TOPPY] Well, I'm glad
that's settled, kuma.

272
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,375
It's a good thing
that curses and bad luck

273
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,875
don't exist in our world, kuma.

274
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,541
[KYRIE] It's not a
good thing at all, Toppy!

275
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,041
And why's that, kuma?

276
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,333
[KYRIE] Because at this
point everyone in town knows

277
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,541
I broke off a branch
from the cherry tree.

278
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,916
And if nothing
bad happens to me,

279
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,541
they're going to figure
out that the curse is a lie.

280
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,833
And then everything Jade
worked for will be for nothing.

281
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,208
[MORTE] I think
it's a little too soon

282
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,833
to say that nothing
bad will happen to you.

283
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,833
[MORTE] You never know
when some unspeakable,

284
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,875
terrifying misfortune
could befall us,

285
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,833
catching us all by surprise.

286
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,708
Wait... What are
you saying, kuma?

287
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,500
Do you really believe in
that sort of thing, Morte?

288
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,666
Hm. I guess I do.

289
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,250
But we know for a fact the curse

290
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,041
of the cherry
tree is just a lie.

291
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,583
And there's nothing
we can do about it, kuma.

292
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,750
Yeah, but Toppy...
now the cherry tree is

293
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,291
in danger of being cut down.

294
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,083
It's just...

295
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,166
[KYRIE] There must be
something we can do.

296
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:54,416
[TOPPY] Aaah! Gross! Bird
poop has just landed on me...!

297
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,291
Eeek, oww...! Now a big potted
plant just fell on my head!

298
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,791
What the heck
is this, kuma?

299
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,791
Whaddaya mean?
It's a script?

300
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,333
[TOPPY] You spent all
night thinking of ways to

301
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,000
fix things, kuma, and this
is all you came up with?

302
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,916
Yeah... And since the
curse doesn't actually exist

303
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,458
then all we can do is
make it up from scratch.

304
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,333
First, we have to do it
in front of a big crowd.

305
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,000
[KYRIE] Oh, and it'll
be much more effective

306
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,708
if the Frog Master sees it too.

307
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,041
So, our best bet is to
do it along the boulevard

308
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,625
that passes right in front
of the Lord's Mansion.

309
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,000
So once we get there, bird poop

310
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,666
will land on your
