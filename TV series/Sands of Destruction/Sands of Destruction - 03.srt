1
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:55,500
[KYRIE] I had managed to
hide my identity as a human

2
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,083
from the world pretty well,

3
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,458
blending into beastmen
society with ease.

4
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,083
When all of a sudden
the World Destruction

5
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,000
Committee barged into my life.

6
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,416
[WSC SOLDIER] Everyone
freeze! Don't move!

7
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,125
[MORTE] You are so annoying...

8
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,916
I wish you people
would just let things go.

9
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,041
Especially since I spent
all my money on this food!

10
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,291
[KYRIE] They call it the
World Destruction Committee,

11
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,583
but as it turns out...

12
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:19,875
there's only one member!

13
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,833
And her name is Morte Urshela.

14
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,541
Take one more step
and the beastman'll

15
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,250
get it right in the throat!

16
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,458
[WSC SOLDIER] Fire!

17
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,458
[KYRIE] Morte was carrying
a ball that she claimed

18
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,875
had the power to
destroy the world!

19
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,666
It's called the Destruct Code.

20
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,958
And what's worse... she's
actually planning on using it!

21
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,500
Will the world
really be annihilated

22
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,666
if you use this thing?

23
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,291
[MORTE] Yeah, but you have to
know how to use it correctly.

24
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,791
[KYRIE] Morte was being hunted

25
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,750
by the World
Salvation Committee,

26
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,291
an organization
made up of beastmen.

27
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,416
Somehow I got
caught up in this mess

28
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,166
and wound up having
to flee along with her.

29
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,625
I was just a simple
guy with a part-time job...

30
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,041
Why did I have to get involved?

31
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,833
[KYRIE] We were joined by
a rough and tumble warrior

32
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:17,125
from the Hero's Guild.
A bear named Toppy.

33
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,708
The three of us have
traveled great distances,

34
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,958
and now find ourselves
in a land called Bonak.

35
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,208
[KYRIE] I have an idea.
Why don't we forget all this

36
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,875
world destruction nonsense
and help people instead?

37
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,916
I mean that really seems
to be the way it's going.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,458
We end up helping
someone in the end anyway.

39
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,000
Nice idea. But
the way this world is,

40
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,875
we'd be helping people
by destroying it for them.

41
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,541
[KYRIE] From that very moment,
whether I liked it or not,

42
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,083
my journey as part of the
World Destruction Committee

43
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,500
was about to begin...

44
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,541
Or so we thought.

45
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,458
[TOPPY] There are
two kinds of beastmen...

46
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,208
Those who rule over
humans, and those who...

47
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,166
Aaahhh!

48
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,375
Ugh!

49
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,583
[MORTE struggling] 

50
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,458
Ah!

51
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:07,916
Ahhh!

52
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,708
[WARDEN] Now don't you
be giving us no problems,

53
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,666
you got that, human scum?

54
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,625
[WARDEN] It's a 
real shame about you,

55
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,750
being a beastman and all.

56
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,125
[TOPPY] What do you
plan to do with us, kuma?

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,083
[WARDEN] The World Salvation
Committee wants nothing more

58
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,916
than to see your
heads on a platter,

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,750
and they're offering quite
a large sum of money for 'em.

60
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,333
I don't care if the three of
you are in a knitting club.

61
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:34,041
For all we care
you're manna from Heaven.

62
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,916
But this is so
not fair! You can't--

63
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,041
[chuckle] Oh shut up, human.

64
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,458
And don't even think
about trying to defy us.

65
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,125
[WARDEN] They didn't
specify whether or not

66
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,583
they wanted you
in one piece or not.

67
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,000
The exchange'll
happen in two days.

68
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,250
What now?

69
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,791
[MORTE] What?
Isn't it obvious...?

70
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,333
We have to find a
way to break outta here

71
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,916
before the
Salvation jerks show.

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,333
[fart]

73
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,625
[MORTE] Hey, that
wasn't me, I'm a girl!

74
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,750
[TOPPY] My bad, kuma.

75
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,000
[LIA] A prison run by wolves.

76
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,000
[NADJA] Yes. It's
on the edge of nowhere

77
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,958
in a place called Bonak.

78
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,416
We've received word
from them yesterday

79
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,875
that they have three
members of the

80
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:40,041
World Destruction
Committee behind bars.

81
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,041
The three of them
must have terrible luck,

82
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,791
wouldn't you say?

83
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,291
Of all places to end up,

84
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,708
Bonak's would be at
the bottom of the list.

85
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,916
So what exactly did the
prison wolves tell you?

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,583
They said all we need
to do is pay them.

87
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,041
Those greedy
pieces of garbage.

88
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,708
[LIA] But there's no reason
to give them what they want.

89
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,708
We should just break the
prisoners out by force!

90
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,333
That's grown to be a
bad habit of yours, Lia.

91
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,166
[NADJA] Force is not
an option to rely on

92
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,416
and should only be
used when necessary.

93
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,708
If money is all they want,

94
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,250
isn't that more
expedient for all parties?

95
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,250
[grunt]

96
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,750
Gimme a break, this
is a bunch a bull!

97
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,458
Why am I out here
breaking stupid rocks?!

98
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,291
I'm supposed to
be on laundry duty!

99
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,083
What a dirty hellhole.

100
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,666
This place is filled
with the worst of the worst.

101
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,125
Wait, this chick's with the
World Destruction Committee?

102
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,416
Hey, watch it,
man. You have no idea

103
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,791
what she's capable of.

104
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,791
[PRISONER] Yeah,
she freaks me out.

105
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,208
[sigh]

106
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,250
[MORTE] We're surrounded
on all sides by high walls.

107
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,333
Even if we could
climb over, we'd still have

108
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,416
the armed guard
to contend with.

109
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,916
[MORTE] On the other hand,
if we tried out the mines,

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,916
navigating through them
would be next to impossible.

111
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:04,250
[crash]
[GUARD] What the hell is this?!

112
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:06,875
[GUARD] It's bad enough that

113
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,166
you're a pathetically
weak human...

114
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,208
But now you gotta go
and make more work for me!

115
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,041
[WOMAN] I'm sorry...

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,375
Uh...

117
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,333
[CAFÉ OWNER] Hey, humans!

118
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,875
[CAFÉ OWNER] There's dishes
to wash, now get to 'em!

119
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,333
[KYRIE] Finished. Woo!

120
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,333
Hey, you better
take those off the fire.

121
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,208
[CAFÉ OWNER] Oh, uh, right.

122
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,250
[KYRIE] Look, those
pots are boiling over!

123
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,916
[CAFÉ OWNER] Oh,
yeah... I know, I know.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,250
Where has this
kid worked before?

125
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,875
[KYRIE] These plates
do go here, right?!

126
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,041
[GUARD] That's one
of the guys from the

127
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,000
World Destruction Committee?

128
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,666
[PRISONER E] What is
a beastman doing here?

129
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,291
[PRISONER F] I heard that bear
is a criminal mastermind...

130
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,250
Plus I also heard
he's involved with...

131
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,708
the World
Destruction Committee.

132
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,333
Hey buddy, listen I know
you'd rather be anywhere

133
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,958
but prison right
now but I can't just have

134
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,958
you slackin' off all the time.

135
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,375
[sigh]

136
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:18,916
[KYRIE] Finally time to eat!

137
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,916
So?

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,458
[mumbling] So... what?
Aren't 'cha gonna eat?

139
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,166
I'm asking you, were you

140
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,083
able to find anything useful?

141
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,041
A secret passage or maybe
something about the guards?

142
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,125
[KYRIE] The guards thought
this slop was pretty good.

143
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,291
Can you believe it?

144
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,125
That's not what I
meant! Just forget it!

145
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,666
What about you, Toppy?
Did you find anything?

146
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,166
[TOPPY] Yeah, the worst
criminals in the world find me

147
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,666
to be more dangerous
than themselves, kuma.

148
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,291
Okay, whatever.
So what about the guards?

149
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,083
All the guards
are afraid of me.

150
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,375
They won't even
come near me, kuma.

151
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,750
That's really not what I meant!

152
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,125
Sorry, but it
bothers me, alright, kuma?

153
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,458
[TOPPY] What kind of a hero
wins notoriety in a prison...?

154
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,083
Can you name
me even one, kuma?

155
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,250
[MORTE] I get it. But
right now we need to focus on

156
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,166
finding a way
to get outta here.

157
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,458
[footsteps]

158
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,583
I spotted a delivery gate
on one side of the mine.

159
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,583
[MORTE] There were guards
posted, but if we got our

160
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,583
weapons back I think we
could bust out from there.

161
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,958
All that's left is finding
a way out of our cell

162
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,250
and retrieving
the Destruct Code.

163
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,166
[TOPPY] That's easy...
I know exactly where

164
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,708
the Destruct Code is, kuma.

165
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,458
All of our stuff is piled
together in one room, kuma.

166
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,625
[MORTE] Great... Next is...

167
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,916
I think I may
know where they keep

168
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,541
all the keys to the cells at.

169
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,666
Earlier when I brought
food to the guards room

170
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,833
I saw an entire
wall full of them.

171
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,291
[MORTE] The guards room?

172
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,125
[KYRIE] Yeah. It's
just one floor below us.

173
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,958
The only thing is, it's
kind of far away from us.

174
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,250
Way on the opposite
side of the building.

175
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:04,250
Hmmm. Well, that won't
work without access to tools.

176
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,375
[MORTE] I wonder if
there's another way...

177
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,000
[KYRIE] You know now that I
think of it, wild bears like to

178
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,416
dig holes in the
ground for their dens.

179
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,875
Hmmm?

180
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,958
That has absolutely
nothing to do with me, kuma.

181
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,333
Oh, don't deny your heritage.

182
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,208
[MORTE] Plus,
you're the perfect size.

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,166
[MORTE] See?

184
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,875
[TOPPY] Count me out.
You can't expect me to

185
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,833
act like some
random bear, kuma!

186
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,125
Oh, kuma this, kuma that!

187
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,625
We don't have
time for games!

188
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,458
Would you rather live
here forever with all this

189
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,958
criminal notoriety
you hate so much?!

190
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:43,625
[TOPPY grunting]

191
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,500
The world would be a
better place if she was

192
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,375
locked up here for the
rest of eternity, kuma!

193
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,416
[long exhale]

194
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,458
[KYRIE] A guard is giving
medicine to a prisoner.

195
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,500
This is the first time
I've seen an act of kindness

196
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,625
from a beastman to a human.

197
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,333
Morte? Are you asleep?

198
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,708
[GUARD] I'm really
sorry I couldn't

199
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,333
help you out this afternoon.

200
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:41,291
[WOMAN] Don't feel bad.
It happens you know.

201
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:45,291
I hope... you don't think
all beastmen are so cruel.

202
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,666
Like me! I have a hard
time standing by when

203
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,375
you're in prison for a crime
I know you didn't even commit!

204
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,958
And one day you'll
be free. I'm sorry.

205
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,208
As a beastman I know I'm in

206
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,750
no position to be saying this...

207
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,916
[WOMAN laughing]

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,416
I'm sorry. But you're
just such a sweetheart.

209
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,666
[WOMAN] And your face is
beet red. It's so cute.

210
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,875
Thank you, Shin.

211
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:25,958
[WOMAN winces]

212
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:27,958
[GUARD A] You again!

213
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,958
Always making more work for me.

214

Seems like talking to
ya doesn't do much good!

215
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,250
[GUARD A] Filthy human.
You think you can defy me?

216
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,500
Seems like talking to you...

217
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,833
doesn't do much good!

218
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,333
[MORTE] Filthy human...

219
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,166
Filthy beastman...
You know you make me sick!

220

[whistle blows]

221
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,541
[WARDEN] Is the
World Salvation Committee

222
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,875
still on schedule
for tomorrow morning?

223
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,375
[SHIN] Yes, sir. No details
have changed as of yet.

224
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,541
I'm afraid that the
incident this afternoon with

225
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,541
the World Destruction
Committee girl fighting

226
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,333
that guard could
give the other prisoners

227
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,333
ideas that
could undermine us.

228
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,875
Tomorrow's a big day.
Lets keep them in their place.

229
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,208
Go do a round
of room inspections.

230
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,708
Yes, sir.

00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,125
[knock knock]

Huh?

233
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,625
Room inspections...
Do you mind giving me a hand?

234
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,791
[GUARD A] Why now? It's
the middle of the night.

front and center.

We're doing room inspections.

00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,000
How'd it go?

247
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,208
Got 'em.

248
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:23,166
[footsteps]

[door unlocking]

250
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,625
This tunnel leads to
a subterranean mine shaft.

251
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,666
[SHIN] Now... once you're in
the tunnel, you'll meet up with

252
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,083
those three from the
World Destruction Committee.

253
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,041
Be careful. It's
a maze down there,

254
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,000
but I've marked
a trail for you.

255
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,291
At the very end,
just as you exit the mine,

256
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,125
there's a delivery gate on
the other side of the opening.

257
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,500
There will be
some guards there,

258
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,708
but if you're
with the other three,

259
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,458
they should be
able to handle them.

260
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,083
Wait, that's crazy!

261
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,708
Oh, don't worry, Aya.

262
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,333
[SHIN] This afternoon I
saw that girl throw one of

263
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,333
the guards like
he was a rag doll.

264
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,083
Those three aren't
like any other prisoners

265
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,125
I've ever run across
before, and besides,

266
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,583
they don't seem to be
very bad people either.

267
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,083
I can't even tell you
how long I've been hoping

268
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,416
and waiting for humans
like them to appear here.

269
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,750
But Shin, I'm
worried about you!

270
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,458
If they ever found out
you were behind this...

271
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,041
[AYA] Who knows
what they'd do to you.

272
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,125
I've done a lot of
very bad things in my past

273
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,708
but I see this as repentance.

274
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,666
[SHIN] Tonight, after the
last rounds have been made,

275
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,500
I'll lead the three
of them here myself.

276
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,833
So make sure you're
ready to go. Got it?

277
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,208
[AYA] Shin, wait!

278
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,666
[SHIN] Bye.

279
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,083
[KYRIE] 'Kay, he's gone.

280
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,666
First off, we need to
secure the Destruct Code.

281
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,125
Oh right... I totally
forgot. I should probably

282
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,125
get their things back to them.

283
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,500
Right. Is everyone ready?

284
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,291
[BOTH] Auhh!

00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,958

you make a sound!

Wait...!

[MORTE] Keep your mouth shut
and I won't take your head off.

00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,041
Uh... But I'm with you guys!

00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,458
I said keep your
trap shut, got it!

As a hero, I apologize
for having to attack

My name is Morte of the
