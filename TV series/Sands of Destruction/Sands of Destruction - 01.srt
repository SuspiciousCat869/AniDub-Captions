hiding somewhere
here in town...

00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,125
So instead of sitting here
and drinking the day away

8
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,291
like some two-bit
bum, why don't you try

00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:54,583
and save the world by
rounding those dirt-bags up?

included room and board.

Ahhh!

318
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,333
[WSC SOLDIER B] That's enough!

319
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,458
[WSC SOLDIER B] Stand down!

320
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,541
[KYRIE chuckles]

321
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:36,708
[KYRIE] This never
would have happened if

322
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,125
you had just cut
my ropes like I asked.

323
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,333
Aha-ha!

324
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,041
[roar]

325
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,708
[ALL panicking]

326
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,083
No, please. Not again!

327
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,666
Aaahhh!

328
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,208
Linan!

329
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,125
Ahhh!

330
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,708
[KYRIE screaming]

331
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,625
Your brother sent me
to help little girl...

332
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,083
Ahhh...!

333
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,250
[WSC SOLDIER B] Hold it...
Are you a member of

334
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,625
the World
Destruction Committee?!

335
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,125
What? No, I'm not with them!

336
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,916
[WSC SOLDIER C] Just kill
him along with the other two!

337
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,625
Wait, I'm innocent, kuma!

338
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,666
[MORTE] Alright, stop.
That's far enough!

339
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,333
Take another step
and I'll activate this.

340
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,916
[WSC SOLDIER C] She
has the Destruct Code!

341
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,625
[WSC SOLDIER B]
She's bluffing...!

342
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,000
There's no way she
has the nerve to do it.

343
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,458
Mmm.

344
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,541
You're bluffing?!

345
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,500
[WSC SOLDIER B] Now be a
good girl and hand it over!

346
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,416
Uh!

347
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,291
[WSC SOLDIERS gasp]

348
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,375
[BOTH gasp]

349
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,166
[KYRIE] What's happening?!

350
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:18,083
[growling]

351
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,375
[MORTE] Bring that over here!

352
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,833
[KYRIE] Wha--?

353
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:24,750
[KYRIE] You're crazy!

354
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,208
[BEAR] Don't be chicken, kuma!

355
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,583
[CAT MINIONS screaming]

356
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:33,041
[roar]

357
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,791
[KYRIE] heavy breathing]

358
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,666
So... will
the world really be

359
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,041
annihilated if
you use this thing?

360
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,875
[MORTE] Yeah, but you have to
know how to use it correctly.

361
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,166
Though I must admit
that's the first time

362
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,916
I've seen it glow like that.

363
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,208
You had to have
done something to it.

364
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,875
[KYRIE] No, I
didn't do anything!

365
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:59,291
Oh, whatever.
Just give it back.

366
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,750
[LINAN] Hey you guys.
Thank you so much.

367
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,625
No we're part of the
World Destruction Committee...

368
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:14,375
and we haven't really done
anything to deserve your thanks.

369
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,083
Poor Mister Detective...

370
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,000
[MORTE] See ya later!

371
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,791
[KYRIE] Hey wait,
where're you going?!

372
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,916
[MORTE] I'm
commandeering this boat!

373
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,500
It's almost hard to
believe those two are

374
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,708
actually with the World
Destruction Committee.

375
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,875
[motor running]

376
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,458
Hey, kuma!

377
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,125
You no good
boat thief, kuma!

378
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,250
Who in the
heck is that bear?

379
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,250
Well it, uh... It
looks like he may be

380
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,875
a detective working
with the Hero's Guild.

381
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,333
Off my boat!

382
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,541
I think I
should point out...

383
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,166
those soldiers thought
you were a member of

384
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,666
the World Destruction
Committee too.

385
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,166
That means you
just escaped with us.

386
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,083
[chuckles]
Tough break my man!

387
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,750
That goes for you too.

388
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,000
So what now? You got
any big plans for us?

389
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,041
Didn't I already tell you...?

390
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:17,000
We're all going
to destroy the world.

391
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:22,208
[BEAR] It turns out there's
another kindda hero...

392
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:26,083
The kind that leads the
world to destruction... kuma.

393
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:06,541
[MORTE] After slipping away
from those annoying jerks

394
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,458
chasinng after us,
we found ourselves on the

395
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:12,041
pleasure ship Jifnil. In
the chaos of hopes and dreams

396
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,708
that is the Jifnil,
we come across a smuggler

397
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:17,166
and two people from the
World Salvation Committee.

398
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,458
Though will I be willing to put
the Destruct Code on the line

399
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,250
during a card game?
You better believe it!

400
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,291
Next time on
Sands of Destruction,

401
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,958
"There are Two Kinds of Worlds."

402
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,208
[KYRIE] How come the
two of us have to be

403
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,375
on the wanted list with
all the other fugitives?

404
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:30,833
[BEAR] Kuma...!
