[RIMURU] With my
excursion to Dwargon over,

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:27.625 align:middle
I made a quick trip
to Ingrassia.

00:00:27.708 --> 00:00:31.083 align:middle
[RIMURU] I will now announce
the results of your final exams.

00:00:31.167 --> 00:00:34.417 align:middle
[whimpering]

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:39.250 align:middle
--What?
--He melted!

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.458 align:middle
Whoa. That bad?!

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:43.792 align:middle
[RIMURU]
It turns out that all of you...

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:45.458 align:middle
[gulping, whimpering]

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:47.083 align:middle
[RIMURU]
...passed the test!

00:00:47.167 --> 00:00:49.792 align:middle
[groaning]

00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:51.583 align:middle
Hey! Don't scare us like that!

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:54.208 align:middle
[RIMURU] Life's more fun
with a few surprises.

00:00:54.292 --> 00:00:56.042 align:middle
Whatever! We passed.

00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:59.208 align:middle
Yep! Not that I ever doubted
our test-taking abilities.

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:01.417 align:middle
Looks like we'll advance
to the next grade.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.417 align:middle
And we'll get to stay together.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.542 align:middle
Yay! Thank goodness!

00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:07.375 align:middle
[RIMURU]
You guys were awesome sauce.

00:01:07.458 --> 00:01:09.750 align:middle
Now that you've passed your
finals, my job as your teacher

00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:12.208 align:middle
is officially donion rings.

00:01:12.292 --> 00:01:15.125 align:middle
Once this term ends, Professor
Tiss will take over for me,

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:18.500 align:middle
and I'll return back
home to Tempest.

00:01:18.583 --> 00:01:19.708 align:middle
How sad.

00:01:19.792 --> 00:01:21.542 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Turn that frown upside down!

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:25.417 align:middle
I have a few days left and I
wanna be sent off with a smile.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.042 align:middle
I'll let you in on a secret.

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:29.750 align:middle
Alice. Chloe. Ryota.

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:31.458 align:middle
Kenya and Gale.

00:01:31.542 --> 00:01:34.833 align:middle
No matter where I'm at,
I'll never forget you.

00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.458 align:middle
Thank you, Teach.

00:01:37.542 --> 00:01:41.167 align:middle
[gasps] More importantly, don't
forget about your promise to us!

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.250 align:middle
[RIMURU]
What promise?

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:43.250 align:middle
[KENYA]
Come on!

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:44.750 align:middle
Don't play dumb.

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:47.500 align:middle
You said if we passed finals,
you'd give us more manga!

00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:49.292 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Don't worry, I know.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:52.625 align:middle
I've got every last volume
of Parasyte ready for you.

00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:53.958 align:middle
Heck yeah!

00:01:54.042 --> 00:01:58.083 align:middle
[laughter]

00:01:58.167 --> 00:01:59.792 align:middle
[RIMURU] Professor Tiss,
the kids are advancing to

00:01:59.875 --> 00:02:01.917 align:middle
the next grade,
thanks to your help.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.208 align:middle
Oh, it wasn't me.

00:02:03.292 --> 00:02:05.292 align:middle
They're the ones who
did all the hard work.

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:06.583 align:middle
Well, regardless.

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:09.917 align:middle
I'm glad I can leave them
in such capable hands.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.500 align:middle
Take good care of them for me.

00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:12.875 align:middle
Right!

00:02:21.042 --> 00:02:23.458 align:middle
We're here.
Check it out, Myulan.

00:02:25.917 --> 00:02:28.042 align:middle
[YOUM]
That's the nation of monsters,

00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:30.500 align:middle
the Jura Tempest Federation.

00:04:08.417 --> 00:04:12.125 align:middle
Allow me to introduce our newest
group member, Myulan the wizard.

00:04:12.208 --> 00:04:15.208 align:middle
Hello, Myulan.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:04:15.292 --> 00:04:16.333 align:middle
[MYULAN]
Likewise.

00:04:16.417 --> 00:04:18.750 align:middle
Welcome. Please make
yourself at home.

00:04:18.833 --> 00:04:21.792 align:middle
Myulan's going to be our
consultant and military advisor.

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:24.167 align:middle
She'll help us fight
against magical attacks.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.625 align:middle
Really? You must be very strong!

00:04:26.708 --> 00:04:28.125 align:middle
[MYULAN]
Uh, I wouldn't say that.

00:04:28.208 --> 00:04:30.083 align:middle
[hammer banging]

00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:36.042 align:middle
[saw grinding]

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:42.042 align:middle
Are you guys having a festival?

00:04:42.125 --> 00:04:43.542 align:middle
We're not.

00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:46.292 align:middle
But Lord Rimuru will be making
his official return soon.

00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:48.708 align:middle
It's more of a welcome
back celebration.

00:04:48.792 --> 00:04:50.375 align:middle
[MYULAN gasps]

00:04:50.458 --> 00:04:51.625 align:middle
[SHION]
Well, then.

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:53.625 align:middle
We still have some work
we need to take care of.

00:04:53.708 --> 00:04:55.750 align:middle
Excuse us.

00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:58.542 align:middle
Oh. Feel free to visit
the hot spring later.

00:04:58.625 --> 00:05:00.125 align:middle
The hot spring?

00:05:00.208 --> 00:05:02.458 align:middle
[SHUNA] You'll feel much
better after a good sweat.

00:05:02.542 --> 00:05:05.250 align:middle
Right. I'll check
it out, thank you.

00:05:12.458 --> 00:05:14.208 align:middle
[MYULAN]
So those are Kijin.

00:05:14.292 --> 00:05:17.333 align:middle
Each one of them is
tremendously powerful.

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:18.500 align:middle
Shall we, then?

00:05:18.583 --> 00:05:20.792 align:middle
I'll give you the grand
tour of Tempest.

00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.292 align:middle
[YOUM]
This is the blacksmith's shop.

00:05:30.375 --> 00:05:32.208 align:middle
Those two make the best
armor and weapons

00:05:32.292 --> 00:05:34.000 align:middle
you'll ever lay eyes on.

00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:35.542 align:middle
[MYULAN gasps]

00:05:38.083 --> 00:05:39.667 align:middle
[YOUM]
This is our newest build.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.167 align:middle
Pretty fancy, huh?

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.292 align:middle
Uh-huh.

00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:45.917 align:middle
[KIDS laughing]

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.125 align:middle
[LIZARDMAN 10F]
Good afternoon!

00:05:48.208 --> 00:05:50.417 align:middle
Oh, thanks so much
for swinging by!

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.417 align:middle
Of course. Here's the supply
of high potions.

00:05:57.208 --> 00:05:59.125 align:middle
Perfect. They're all here.

00:05:59.208 --> 00:06:01.750 align:middle
Then we just need
your signature, please!

00:06:01.833 --> 00:06:03.333 align:middle
[KOBY]
No problem.

00:06:03.417 --> 00:06:07.000 align:middle
I think we may need to increase
our orders starting next month.

00:06:07.083 --> 00:06:09.583 align:middle
I'll come and discuss the
details as soon as I can.

00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:11.958 align:middle
So, will you please
let Gabiru know?

00:06:12.042 --> 00:06:13.917 align:middle
Just leave everything to us!

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:20.333 align:middle
[MYULAN] They're really able to
produce that many high potions?

00:06:20.417 --> 00:06:23.167 align:middle
[MYULAN] Given their military
strength and technologies,

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.167 align:middle
this nation is truly
a formidable threat.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.500 align:middle
[YOUM]
Hey. Something wrong?

00:06:27.583 --> 00:06:30.750 align:middle
[MYULAN gasps]
No. Everything's fine.

00:06:30.833 --> 00:06:33.125 align:middle
C'mon, I'll show you
the training ground.

00:06:44.875 --> 00:06:46.958 align:middle
[MYULAN]
What a gullible man.

00:06:47.042 --> 00:06:48.708 align:middle
Unbelievable.

00:06:48.792 --> 00:06:51.250 align:middle
I'm only here on Lord Clayman's
orders to investigate

00:06:51.333 --> 00:06:53.792 align:middle
this nation of monsters.

00:06:53.875 --> 00:06:56.833 align:middle
Yes. I'm merely using Youm.

00:06:58.833 --> 00:07:00.375 align:middle
[MYULAN]
He's a fool.

00:07:00.458 --> 00:07:04.292 align:middle
And what's more,
I doubt he suspects I'm a majin.

00:07:05.375 --> 00:07:07.625 align:middle
All right, let's take a break.

00:07:12.083 --> 00:07:14.458 align:middle
[groaning]

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.792 align:middle
My body...

00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:21.375 align:middle
I can't be sure, but I think the
old man broke everything.

00:07:21.458 --> 00:07:23.708 align:middle
Ow, I can't feel my face...

00:07:23.792 --> 00:07:26.042 align:middle
Hey. Quick question.

00:07:26.125 --> 00:07:28.792 align:middle
Is that Ogre-- I mean,
Master Hakurou,

00:07:28.875 --> 00:07:31.708 align:middle
always so unforgiving
during training?

00:07:31.792 --> 00:07:33.292 align:middle
[GOBTA]
Pretty much.

00:07:33.375 --> 00:07:34.917 align:middle
I can't feel my face.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.667 align:middle
--[GRUCIUS groans]
--[GOBTA] Aw, man.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.667 align:middle
This is getting old.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.292 align:middle
All right. Enough dying.
On your feet!

00:07:42.375 --> 00:07:44.667 align:middle
Every day? Really?

00:07:46.417 --> 00:07:48.417 align:middle
I'm starting to think it's
a miracle that you guys

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.583 align:middle
are even still alive--it's
actually kind of impressive.

00:07:51.667 --> 00:07:54.542 align:middle
I wish we could recruit your
group into the Animal Kingdom.

00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:56.083 align:middle
[YOUM]
Hey. Grucius!

00:07:56.167 --> 00:07:58.333 align:middle
[GRUCIUS]
Huh? What's up, Youm?

00:07:58.417 --> 00:07:59.750 align:middle
[YOUM chuckles]

00:08:01.333 --> 00:08:02.792 align:middle
So, a rough day of training?

00:08:02.875 --> 00:08:05.500 align:middle
Shut up, Youm.
Who's the girl?

00:08:05.583 --> 00:08:09.583 align:middle
Oh. This is Myulan, our newest
and most skilled member.

00:08:09.667 --> 00:08:11.875 align:middle
I bet you wouldn't be able
to stand against her.

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:15.167 align:middle
"Most skilled"? Seriously?
I don't believe it.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.625 align:middle
A scrawny little woman
like her beat you?

00:08:17.708 --> 00:08:19.958 align:middle
You're more than welcome
to fight her yourself.

00:08:20.042 --> 00:08:21.958 align:middle
If you manage the impossible
and take her down,

00:08:22.042 --> 00:08:24.000 align:middle
I'll call you "boss"
from here on out.

00:08:24.083 --> 00:08:27.125 align:middle
Fair enough. If she somehow
manages to defeat me,

00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:29.250 align:middle
then I'll gladly
become your underling.

00:08:29.333 --> 00:08:30.500 align:middle
[MYULAN sighs]

00:08:30.583 --> 00:08:33.000 align:middle
Unlike Youm, I won't go
easy on you just because

00:08:33.083 --> 00:08:34.375 align:middle
you have a pretty face.

00:08:34.458 --> 00:08:36.250 align:middle
[sighs]

00:08:36.333 --> 00:08:37.792 align:middle
Here goes!

00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:43.750 align:middle
[YOUM laughs]

00:08:43.833 --> 00:08:46.125 align:middle
I wonder how many other people
you can crush, Myulan?

00:08:46.208 --> 00:08:48.667 align:middle
Some champion you are!
Get me out of here!

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.417 align:middle
[sighs]

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.250 align:middle
[GRUCIUS]
Hey, lady.

00:08:52.333 --> 00:08:54.083 align:middle
You beat me.

00:08:54.167 --> 00:08:55.750 align:middle
Ah, so you admit it, do you?

00:08:55.833 --> 00:08:58.708 align:middle
Like I have much of a choice.
You're a strong one.

00:08:58.792 --> 00:09:00.083 align:middle
Very impressive.

00:09:00.167 --> 00:09:02.083 align:middle
--Isn't she?
--[chuckles]

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:04.542 align:middle
Now then, let's talk about
that promise you made.

00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:07.708 align:middle
Yeah, yeah. You won,
so I'll start calling you boss.

00:09:07.792 --> 00:09:09.958 align:middle
Oh, I wasn't serious about that.

00:09:10.042 --> 00:09:13.500 align:middle
Nope, you and I had a deal.
I should warn you, though.

00:09:13.583 --> 00:09:14.625 align:middle
[YOUM]
Huh?

00:09:14.708 --> 00:09:16.458 align:middle
If Lord Carrion
ordered me to kill you,

00:09:16.542 --> 00:09:18.333 align:middle
then I would not hesitate.

00:09:18.417 --> 00:09:21.083 align:middle
No matter what, I'm still
loyal to the Beast King.

00:09:21.167 --> 00:09:25.458 align:middle
Sorry, but that's a rule
I could never possibly yield on.

00:09:25.542 --> 00:09:28.542 align:middle
Fair enough.
I'll keep that in mind.

00:09:33.167 --> 00:09:35.917 align:middle
I think it would be interesting
to visit some new countries.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.208 align:middle
So, I'll join
your party for now.

00:09:38.292 --> 00:09:41.250 align:middle
That's fine by me,
but are you sure?

00:09:41.333 --> 00:09:43.708 align:middle
My personal mission is
to broaden my horizons,

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:45.333 align:middle
so yeah, I'm positive.

00:09:45.417 --> 00:09:49.250 align:middle
I say, comrades, that fight
was truly incredible.

00:09:49.333 --> 00:09:50.292 align:middle
It was?

00:09:50.375 --> 00:09:52.333 align:middle
You've given me a great idea.

00:09:52.417 --> 00:09:53.708 align:middle
With our new lady
friend's magic,

00:09:53.792 --> 00:09:56.167 align:middle
we could finally pulverize
that mean geezer!

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.917 align:middle
[GRUCIUS] Hold on. By "geezer,"
you mean Master Hakurou?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.625 align:middle
What sort of plan
did you have in mind?

00:10:00.708 --> 00:10:02.792 align:middle
Hey, not so loud, fools!

00:10:02.875 --> 00:10:04.292 align:middle
Listen up.

00:10:04.375 --> 00:10:07.000 align:middle
The first step is to utilize
Myulan's magic, and then...

00:10:07.083 --> 00:10:08.750 align:middle
[MYULAN]
What in the world am I doing?

00:10:08.833 --> 00:10:11.167 align:middle
This is pointless.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.458 align:middle
[HAKUROU]
Oh? A mock battle?

00:10:13.542 --> 00:10:15.333 align:middle
Yeah, today is the day
we'll finally make you

00:10:15.417 --> 00:10:18.042 align:middle
cry out in misery!
I hope you're ready, old ma--

00:10:18.125 --> 00:10:20.167 align:middle
I mean, uh, Master!

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.667 align:middle
[YOUM] Does Gobta think
he can provoke a kijin?

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.125 align:middle
I commend your spirit.

00:10:24.208 --> 00:10:25.708 align:middle
Besides, it's about
time I gave you

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:27.792 align:middle
some real-life practice again.

00:10:27.875 --> 00:10:30.417 align:middle
[GOBTA] Our pre-set magic
circle is already in place.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.417 align:middle
Now we just gotta
lead him into it.

00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.375 align:middle
[HAKUROU]
Let the mock battle commence!

00:10:36.458 --> 00:10:38.042 align:middle
[GOBTA gasps, grunts]

00:10:38.125 --> 00:10:40.125 align:middle
I figured he'd come
straight for me!

00:10:40.917 --> 00:10:42.625 align:middle
Liquefaction.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.542 align:middle
[HAKUROU]
Hmm.

00:10:45.625 --> 00:10:48.417 align:middle
We've got him!
Everyone strike at once--

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.417 align:middle
[gasping]

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.167 align:middle
[GOBTA]
The old man disappeared?!

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.875 align:middle
[gasping]

00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.625 align:middle
Who you calling "old man"?!

00:10:54.708 --> 00:10:57.292 align:middle
[yelps]
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Where were you?!

00:10:57.375 --> 00:11:00.000 align:middle
--[HAKUROU] Hmph!
--[GOBTA groans]

00:11:00.083 --> 00:11:01.083 align:middle
No way!

00:11:01.167 --> 00:11:02.875 align:middle
How did he even
get out of the ground?

00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.542 align:middle
I used Flash Step.

00:11:04.625 --> 00:11:06.292 align:middle
A skill I taught you.

00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:10.292 align:middle
[YOUM whimpers]

00:11:16.458 --> 00:11:19.417 align:middle
Now then, would you three
care to explain yourselves?

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.167 align:middle
What could've possessed you to
try and trap a poor "old man"

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.167 align:middle
such as myself?

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.083 align:middle
[whimpering]

00:11:26.833 --> 00:11:28.042 align:middle
Well, sir--

00:11:28.125 --> 00:11:30.417 align:middle
Oh, please. I wasn't
referring to you, my dear.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.625 align:middle
I have no doubt you were
merely dragged into this scheme

00:11:32.708 --> 00:11:34.167 align:middle
by these idiots.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.083 align:middle
Okay...

00:11:36.167 --> 00:11:39.042 align:middle
While I would hope that you
three don't need to be reminded,

00:11:39.125 --> 00:11:41.583 align:middle
I will still warn you not to
test something so foolish

00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:43.167 align:middle
on Lord Rimuru.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.000 align:middle
Yeah, we're not that stupid.

00:11:45.083 --> 00:11:47.875 align:middle
Lord Rimuru's way too strong--
he'd pulverize us.

00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.458 align:middle
Oh, you think so?

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:52.667 align:middle
Sometimes, I get the feeling he
would be quite easily deceived.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:53.833 align:middle
[RIMURU sneezes]

00:11:53.917 --> 00:11:55.750 align:middle
[MJOLMIRE]
What was that, you got a cold?

00:11:55.833 --> 00:11:58.625 align:middle
No way, someone's probably
talking about me.

00:11:58.708 --> 00:12:01.875 align:middle
That's true, you're
certainly popular enough.

00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.333 align:middle
Anyway, care for another round?

00:12:03.417 --> 00:12:05.125 align:middle
[RIMURU] Sure, there's
always room for more!

00:12:05.208 --> 00:12:06.375 align:middle
[MJOLMIRE chuckles]

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.708 align:middle
Aw, yeah. I'm alive again.

00:12:11.792 --> 00:12:13.667 align:middle
I don't think that
geezer will ever die,

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.083 align:middle
even if we did kill him.

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:16.458 align:middle
C'mon, Gobta.

00:12:16.542 --> 00:12:18.500 align:middle
Maybe it would be a more
prudent idea to just give up

00:12:18.583 --> 00:12:20.917 align:middle
on trying to catch Master
Hakurou off-guard.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.167 align:middle
No, He must suffer the way
that we have suffered!

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:25.792 align:middle
Your determination
is rather impressive.

00:12:25.875 --> 00:12:28.292 align:middle
To be honest, I was more
impressed with the wizard lady.

00:12:28.375 --> 00:12:29.583 align:middle
She was really amazing!

00:12:29.667 --> 00:12:33.083 align:middle
[chuckles] I know.
Not to mention, attractive.

00:12:33.167 --> 00:12:36.167 align:middle
You said it. I wonder if she
would bare my children.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.458 align:middle
Sorry, pal, but there's
no way that's happening!

00:12:38.542 --> 00:12:40.667 align:middle
Don't forget that
Myulan works for me!

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:43.542 align:middle
All's fair in love and war.
The swift get the spoils.

00:12:43.625 --> 00:12:45.083 align:middle
[GOBTA]
"The swift get the spoils"?

00:12:45.167 --> 00:12:46.083 align:middle
I am on it!

00:12:46.167 --> 00:12:48.958 align:middle
[YOUM]
Whoa! Back off, Gobta.

00:12:49.042 --> 00:12:51.792 align:middle
[SHUNA groans]

00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:54.208 align:middle
Those boys have
such vulgar thoughts.

00:12:54.292 --> 00:12:56.208 align:middle
Don't you worry, Princess Shuna!

00:12:56.292 --> 00:12:58.542 align:middle
I'll go give them an attitude
adjustment by beating them

00:12:58.625 --> 00:13:00.250 align:middle
until they beg us for mercy!

00:13:00.333 --> 00:13:02.417 align:middle
I'd be more than happy
to help with that.

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:07.292 align:middle
[giggling]

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.750 align:middle
Read faster, Ken,
I'm waiting on you!

00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:22.208 align:middle
Wait your turn, Alice,
I just got to the good part!

00:13:22.292 --> 00:13:24.042 align:middle
I never saw this twist coming.

00:13:24.125 --> 00:13:25.875 align:middle
Now that's some good writing.

00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.375 align:middle
[CHLOE whimpers]

00:13:30.458 --> 00:13:33.125 align:middle
[RIMURU]
So, how's business treating ya?

00:13:33.208 --> 00:13:35.375 align:middle
[MJOLMIRE] Thanks to you,
our top-quality high potion's

00:13:35.458 --> 00:13:37.125 align:middle
attracted tons of buyers.

00:13:37.208 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle
We've made sure to spread the
word in the Western Provinces,

00:13:40.083 --> 00:13:42.958 align:middle
so we should be getting a wealth
of new orders fairly soon.

00:13:43.042 --> 00:13:45.875 align:middle
[RIMURU] And you'll make
a small fortune, right?

00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.167 align:middle
[MJOLMIRE]
Naturally.

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:49.792 align:middle
Then again, that's what
this job is all about.

00:13:49.875 --> 00:13:52.042 align:middle
Oh, but don't you worry,
I'll definitely make sure that

00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:55.708 align:middle
the Jura Tempest Federation
gets its fair share of profits!

00:13:55.792 --> 00:13:57.958 align:middle
Yeah, I wasn't really
worried to begin with.

00:13:58.042 --> 00:14:01.292 align:middle
[MJOLMIRE] And speaking of
money, tonight is on me, okay?

00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:02.958 align:middle
To thank you for the business,
and to give you

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:05.833 align:middle
a little farewell party,
sound good?

00:14:05.917 --> 00:14:08.417 align:middle
I guess I can
allow it this one time.

00:14:09.833 --> 00:14:12.833 align:middle
Baron Veryard is quite grateful
for your business, too.

00:14:12.917 --> 00:14:14.875 align:middle
Once those high potions
are on the market,

00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:18.375 align:middle
the Kingdom of Blumund stands
to make a fair amount of money.

00:14:18.458 --> 00:14:19.917 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Veryard, huh?

00:14:23.833 --> 00:14:25.833 align:middle
[RIMURU] Don't get me wrong,
I'm glad that Tempest

00:14:25.917 --> 00:14:29.833 align:middle
and the Kingdom of Blumund were
able to forge a security pact.

00:14:31.292 --> 00:14:32.958 align:middle
But they kinda got me.

00:14:33.042 --> 00:14:35.083 align:middle
If some other country
tries to invade Blumund

00:14:35.167 --> 00:14:37.000 align:middle
through the forest,
then Tempest would have to serve

00:14:37.083 --> 00:14:38.292 align:middle
as a breakwater,
which feels like

00:14:38.375 --> 00:14:39.833 align:middle
a lot of pressure, you know?

00:14:39.917 --> 00:14:42.708 align:middle
Yes, but that's
the nature of politics.

00:14:42.792 --> 00:14:44.333 align:middle
Though on the reverse
side of things,

00:14:44.417 --> 00:14:46.875 align:middle
if Tempest were the one being
invaded by another nation,

00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.458 align:middle
then Blumund would likely
come fight by your side.

00:14:49.542 --> 00:14:51.833 align:middle
It's meant to be
mutually beneficial.

00:14:51.917 --> 00:14:54.250 align:middle
Yeah, except no one would
want to invade Tempest.

00:14:54.333 --> 00:14:56.708 align:middle
[MJOLMIRE growls] I wouldn't be
so quick to make such statements

00:14:56.792 --> 00:14:57.833 align:middle
if I were you.

00:14:57.917 --> 00:14:59.375 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Hmm?

00:14:59.458 --> 00:15:01.458 align:middle
Believe it or not, I suspect
that the tiny nation of Tempest

00:15:01.542 --> 00:15:04.292 align:middle
will continue to grow into
a major trade center.

00:15:04.375 --> 00:15:06.792 align:middle
I think Dorf said something
along those lines, too.

00:15:06.875 --> 00:15:09.750 align:middle
If it does play out that way,
there are regions who will see

00:15:09.833 --> 00:15:13.333 align:middle
your growing nation as nothing
more than an obstacle to cross.

00:15:13.417 --> 00:15:16.208 align:middle
The Kingdom of Falmuth
is a prime example.

00:15:16.292 --> 00:15:18.000 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Huh?

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:20.833 align:middle
[laughs]
You should see your face!

00:15:20.917 --> 00:15:22.917 align:middle
It's nothing worth
worrying about right away.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.333 align:middle
Look, all I'm saying is,
it doesn't hurt to be prepared.

00:15:26.417 --> 00:15:29.542 align:middle
For sure. I got ya.

00:15:29.625 --> 00:15:32.250 align:middle
[RIMURU]
The Kingdom of Falmuth.

00:15:32.333 --> 00:15:34.333 align:middle
King Gazel literally
just told me how much

00:15:34.417 --> 00:15:36.333 align:middle
he doesn't like their king.

00:15:36.417 --> 00:15:39.208 align:middle
Didn't he say he was,
like, mega greedy?

00:15:44.167 --> 00:15:46.042 align:middle
[EDOMALIS]
Youm the champion, you say?

00:15:46.125 --> 00:15:48.750 align:middle
Yes, sir. Based on
a rumor that we've heard,

00:15:48.833 --> 00:15:50.917 align:middle
he and his party were
supposedly responsible

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.875 align:middle
for the defeat of the Orc Lord.

00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.333 align:middle
[grunting]

00:15:54.417 --> 00:15:57.167 align:middle
[RAZEN] Though calling him
a "champion" is ridiculous.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.667 align:middle
Well, be that as it may,
the Freedom Union did report

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.875 align:middle
that the Orc Lord
definitely appeared.

00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.458 align:middle
Indeed, which would mean
the story does possess

00:16:04.542 --> 00:16:06.208 align:middle
some measure of truth.

00:16:06.292 --> 00:16:08.500 align:middle
Further regarding
"Youm the champion,"

00:16:08.583 --> 00:16:11.458 align:middle
it would seem he has taken up
residence in Tempest.

00:16:11.542 --> 00:16:13.917 align:middle
[EDOMALIS]
Hmm... Tempest.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.542 align:middle
You mean the nation of monsters?

00:16:16.625 --> 00:16:18.875 align:middle
That's right. Ever since
it was first founded,

00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.167 align:middle
the flow of merchants into
the Kingdom of Falmuth

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:22.917 align:middle
has rapidly declined.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.583 align:middle
Our financial
situation is quite dire.

00:16:25.667 --> 00:16:28.458 align:middle
I believe this is because
merchants can now safely travel

00:16:28.542 --> 00:16:30.750 align:middle
to Dwargon without
passing through here.

00:16:30.833 --> 00:16:32.083 align:middle
[EDOMALIS]
Hmm...

00:16:32.167 --> 00:16:34.042 align:middle
To be honest, this is
a matter of life and death

00:16:34.125 --> 00:16:36.167 align:middle
for the Kingdom of Falmuth.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.500 align:middle
Should Tempest continue
to go unchecked,

00:16:38.583 --> 00:16:41.375 align:middle
they will become renowned in
the Western Provinces as well.

00:16:41.458 --> 00:16:44.000 align:middle
Action against them
will be infeasible.

00:16:44.083 --> 00:16:46.000 align:middle
We must strike while we're able.

00:16:46.083 --> 00:16:49.417 align:middle
Yes, but evolved monsters
present a difficult problem.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.625 align:middle
With their humanoid forms
comes intelligence,

00:16:51.708 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle
which in turn, makes them
even more formidable enemies.

00:16:54.333 --> 00:16:58.667 align:middle
Yes, I see. How many men do
we have that could mobilize now?

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.958 align:middle
Roughly 17,000 men.

00:17:01.042 --> 00:17:02.708 align:middle
That's not enough.

00:17:02.792 --> 00:17:04.292 align:middle
[grunting]

00:17:04.375 --> 00:17:07.417 align:middle
[REYHEIM] There's no need
to worry, my king.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:08.833 align:middle
[FOLGEN]
Hmm?

00:17:08.917 --> 00:17:11.167 align:middle
What's this, Archbishop Reyheim?

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.125 align:middle
Are you implying
the Western Holy Church

00:17:13.208 --> 00:17:14.667 align:middle
has some sort of plan?

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.542 align:middle
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:17:16.625 --> 00:17:18.167 align:middle
In fact, I've been meaning
to inform you that

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.958 align:middle
the Western Holy Church's
headquarters plan to subjugate

00:17:21.042 --> 00:17:22.917 align:middle
the nation of monsters
as an enemy nation

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.083 align:middle
in clear opposition to God.
Please pardon the delay.

00:17:26.167 --> 00:17:28.958 align:middle
My word! You're saying
the Western Holy Church

00:17:29.042 --> 00:17:32.208 align:middle
has recognized Tempest as
a legitimate enemy to our God?

00:17:32.292 --> 00:17:33.250 align:middle
[gasping]

00:17:33.333 --> 00:17:35.167 align:middle
[gasps]

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.208 align:middle
[REYHEIM] However,
they've yet to prove themselves

00:17:37.292 --> 00:17:38.583 align:middle
to be dangerous.

00:17:38.667 --> 00:17:40.708 align:middle
Perhaps we could request
help from another country

00:17:40.792 --> 00:17:43.583 align:middle
to assist in
subjugating them. Yes?

00:17:43.667 --> 00:17:47.625 align:middle
[EDOMALIS] Hmm... So you require
some assistance, do you?

00:17:48.583 --> 00:17:52.875 align:middle
[chuckles] Speaking
hypothetically, of course.

00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.333 align:middle
[REYHEIM chuckles]

00:17:54.417 --> 00:17:56.625 align:middle
If a citizen of our nation
were to be harmed by one of

00:17:56.708 --> 00:18:00.083 align:middle
these monsters, what do you
suppose would happen to them?

00:18:00.167 --> 00:18:03.583 align:middle
Excellent question. If something
so tragic were to occur,

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:05.958 align:middle
the Western Holy Church
would assume the responsibility

00:18:06.042 --> 00:18:09.042 align:middle
of sending the Temple Knights
to rescue its believers.

00:18:09.125 --> 00:18:11.083 align:middle
How very reassuring.

00:18:11.167 --> 00:18:13.792 align:middle
In which case, our kingdom
could then back up the church

00:18:13.875 --> 00:18:15.958 align:middle
and help subdue
the monsters in Tempest.

00:18:16.042 --> 00:18:20.125 align:middle
Yes, indeed. This is
nothing short of a holy war!

00:18:20.208 --> 00:18:22.292 align:middle
We'll begin by sending
in an advance party

00:18:22.375 --> 00:18:23.792 align:middle
to start a commotion!

00:18:23.875 --> 00:18:27.250 align:middle
My king. If I may be so bold,
let's show them our power.

00:18:27.333 --> 00:18:29.542 align:middle
For the advance party,
we should send the Otherworlders

00:18:29.625 --> 00:18:31.167 align:middle
we have at our disposal.

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:34.375 align:middle
Excellent idea. Those
monstrosities might actually

00:18:34.458 --> 00:18:36.625 align:middle
prove to be
rather useful to us.

00:18:36.708 --> 00:18:39.375 align:middle
Regardless, we must
not let our guard down.

00:18:39.458 --> 00:18:41.000 align:middle
[RAZEN]
Fret not, Your Majesty.

00:18:41.083 --> 00:18:43.042 align:middle
To be cautious, we shall
order them to return

00:18:43.125 --> 00:18:45.083 align:middle
after a brief rampage.

00:18:45.167 --> 00:18:47.125 align:middle
[REYHEIM]
My king. If it pleases you,

00:18:47.208 --> 00:18:48.750 align:middle
would you grant me
the honor of allowing me

00:18:48.833 --> 00:18:50.708 align:middle
to try out my secret art?

00:18:50.792 --> 00:18:53.042 align:middle
And what would that be?

00:18:53.125 --> 00:18:54.417 align:middle
Pardon.

00:18:59.042 --> 00:19:00.833 align:middle
[inaudible]

00:19:00.917 --> 00:19:03.583 align:middle
--[whispering]
--Oh...?

00:19:03.667 --> 00:19:05.667 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:08.500 align:middle
[laughs]

00:19:08.583 --> 00:19:10.542 align:middle
That does sound interesting!

00:19:10.625 --> 00:19:13.458 align:middle
Very well.
I shall allow it, Reyheim.

00:19:13.542 --> 00:19:15.333 align:middle
Thank you so much, my king.

00:19:15.417 --> 00:19:17.958 align:middle
I assure you that I will
use my skills expressly for

00:19:18.042 --> 00:19:19.667 align:middle
Your Majesty's glory.

00:19:21.708 --> 00:19:23.583 align:middle
[EDOMALIS chuckles]

00:19:29.708 --> 00:19:32.292 align:middle
[SHOGO]
A nation ruled by a slime?

00:19:33.375 --> 00:19:34.792 align:middle
Are you messing with me?!

00:19:34.875 --> 00:19:37.292 align:middle
Shogo. No need for tantrums.

00:19:37.375 --> 00:19:39.167 align:middle
Allow me to
finish speaking first.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.917 align:middle
Slimes are weak monsters!

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.167 align:middle
How could one become
the ruler of the forest?

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.167 align:middle
Shogo isn't trying to
be rude with his statement.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:47.875 align:middle
It's different in our world.

00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:50.875 align:middle
Slimes are rather famous
for being starter monsters.

00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:53.708 align:middle
Regardless, I'm ordering you
three to travel to Tempest

00:19:53.792 --> 00:19:55.625 align:middle
along with 100 of
our best knights

00:19:55.708 --> 00:19:57.667 align:middle
as part of an advance
scouting party.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.292 align:middle
Get packed.

00:20:04.542 --> 00:20:05.708 align:middle
Oh, wow!

00:20:05.792 --> 00:20:07.833 align:middle
It's been forever since
we went anywhere new!

00:20:07.917 --> 00:20:09.292 align:middle
This is ridiculous.

00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:11.917 align:middle
They're really mobilizing
the army for a stupid slime?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000 align:middle
Yes, well, when that
slime controls forces in

00:20:14.083 --> 00:20:16.125 align:middle
the tens of thousands,
I'd say it's perfectly normal

00:20:16.208 --> 00:20:17.917 align:middle
to see it as a threat.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.292 align:middle
Who knows for sure?

00:20:19.375 --> 00:20:21.750 align:middle
Especially with how
absurdly pathetic the humans

00:20:21.833 --> 00:20:23.125 align:middle
in this world tend to be.

00:20:23.208 --> 00:20:25.417 align:middle
[KIRARA giggles] Have you
ever thought that maybe

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.125 align:middle
you're just too strong?

00:20:27.208 --> 00:20:29.167 align:middle
I mean, the Unique Skills
meant for combat here

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:32.750 align:middle
are assigned so randomly.
Aren't they, Mister Beserker?

00:20:32.833 --> 00:20:34.125 align:middle
You might say that,

00:20:34.208 --> 00:20:36.625 align:middle
but I think yours are
a whole lot scarier, Kirara.

00:20:36.708 --> 00:20:38.083 align:middle
No joke.

00:20:38.167 --> 00:20:40.458 align:middle
Your skills are definitely
a force to be reckoned with.

00:20:40.542 --> 00:20:42.750 align:middle
[KIRARA laughs]

00:20:42.833 --> 00:20:45.417 align:middle
[SHOGO growls]
Damn that stupid old bastard!

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.875 align:middle
I'm tired of him ordering us
around so much!

00:20:47.958 --> 00:20:49.292 align:middle
He's, like, so annoying!

00:20:49.375 --> 00:20:52.125 align:middle
For real! I'm totally gonna
kill the guy one day.

00:20:52.208 --> 00:20:54.542 align:middle
Don't say that, guys,
he's not that bad.

00:20:54.625 --> 00:20:56.708 align:middle
On the plus side, at least
if we do what he says,

00:20:56.792 --> 00:20:59.292 align:middle
he gives us all of the best
food, clothes, and housing

00:20:59.375 --> 00:21:00.792 align:middle
this world has to offer.

00:21:00.875 --> 00:21:03.208 align:middle
Yeah, maybe, but shouldn't
that be a given?

00:21:03.292 --> 00:21:05.583 align:middle
The "best this world
has to offer" is still garbage

00:21:05.667 --> 00:21:08.042 align:middle
compared to the things
we're used to back in our world!

00:21:08.125 --> 00:21:09.750 align:middle
Um, you can say that again!

00:21:09.833 --> 00:21:12.042 align:middle
This place is seriously
lacking in stylish shops,

00:21:12.125 --> 00:21:14.875 align:middle
not to mention the absence
of internet and smartphones.

00:21:14.958 --> 00:21:17.708 align:middle
A world as boring as this one
doesn't deserve to exist

00:21:17.792 --> 00:21:20.542 align:middle
and I couldn't care less if
it collapsed in on itself.

00:21:20.625 --> 00:21:21.958 align:middle
[KYOYA chuckles]

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.417 align:middle
[KYOYA] Shogo and Kirara
don't seem happy about it,

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.958 align:middle
but I see this as
an opportunity.

00:21:30.042 --> 00:21:31.750 align:middle
If war breaks out,

00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:34.333 align:middle
we can kill the men
who control us.

00:21:34.417 --> 00:21:37.625 align:middle
It might be the only way
to regain our freedom.

00:21:37.708 --> 00:21:39.083 align:middle
Heh.

00:21:43.292 --> 00:21:46.208 align:middle
[snoring]

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.917 align:middle
[RIMURU] At the time,
I was still blissfully unaware.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.833 align:middle
I had no idea that a crisis
was about to befall Tempest.

00:23:54.417 --> 00:23:57.125 align:middle
