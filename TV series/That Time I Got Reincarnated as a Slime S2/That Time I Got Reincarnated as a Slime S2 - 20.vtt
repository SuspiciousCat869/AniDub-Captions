00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:34.868 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I made a crystal orb
using Beretta's Chaos Core

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:36.494 position:50% align:center
as a reference.

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:40.498 position:50% align:center
The plan was to have Treyni
inhabit it, soul and all.

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:46.171 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I then enveloped the
orb in an aura equivalent to

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:49.341 position:50% align:center
the holy energy it
already possessed.

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:56.097 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I placed the completed
Chaos Core inside a doll

00:00:56.181 --> 00:01:00.602 position:50% align:center
made from the Dryas, the tree
that was Treyni's original body.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.566 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Mm.

00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:29.255 position:50% align:center
You have my sincerest thanks,
Lord Rimuru.

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:32.258 position:50% align:center
I've successfully evolved
into a Dryas Doll Dryad.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:34.594 position:50% align:center
And now I'll be able to
accompany Lady Ramiris

00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:37.347 position:50% align:center
to Walpurgis without
any concerns.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.557 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute, so does
that mean Treyni will be able

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:41.309 position:50% align:center
to move around freely?

00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:44.145 position:50% align:center
Like, if she wanted, she could
even leave the Forest of Jura?

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.730 position:50% align:center
That's the idea behind it.

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:49.025 position:50% align:center
And since Walpurgis is held in a
specially prepared dimension,

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.277 position:50% align:center
there was a chance that Treyni
wouldn't be able to enter it

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:54.197 position:50% align:center
due to her Dryad form,
so I made this just to be safe.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.533 position:50% align:center
Oh, yay! Congrats, Treyni!

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:59.285 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much, Lady Ramiris.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.913 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Thus, our preparations
steadily continued.

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:04.124 position:50% align:center
The Demon Lords'
banquet, Walpurgis,

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:06.668 position:50% align:center
was set for that evening.

00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:08.628 position:50% align:center
After what felt
like an eternity,

00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:12.215 position:50% align:center
the time had finally come
to settle all of our scores.

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.350 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] The venue has been
created at the entrance

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:47.560 position:50% align:center
to the Great Forest of Jura.

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:48.895 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Right.

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:50.855 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] Basically,
our Lycanthrope soldiers,

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.191 position:50% align:center
disguised as refugees,
will pretend to flee

00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:55.652 position:50% align:center
while luring the enemy
into Geld's trap.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:57.487 position:50% align:center
Where we'll round them all up.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.656 position:50% align:center
We'll be using the barren
wasteland that was once home

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.116 position:50% align:center
to me and my people.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.743 position:50% align:center
The ruins of the former Orc
Kingdom of Orbic will soon

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:05.745 position:50% align:center
become nothing but
a massive graveyard

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.164 position:50% align:center
for Clayman's many forces.

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:14.295 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] So, a nation that fell
victim to Clayman's scheme

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.215 position:50% align:center
will be the site
of the final battle.

00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:19.259 position:50% align:center
What goes around comes around.

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:20.593 position:50% align:center
[GELD]
True.

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:22.053 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] We have
seen all there is to see

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:25.181 position:50% align:center
of the enemy's strength.
Our victory is assured.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] You've got some
serious confidence, my guy.

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:30.020 position:50% align:center
The battle hasn't
even started yet.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:32.897 position:50% align:center
That's because when you
awakened, I acquired a new gift.

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.899 position:50% align:center
The Unique Skill, "Born Leader."

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:37.610 position:50% align:center
This skill allows me to read
the enemy's every movement

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:40.447 position:50% align:center
as clearly as if it were
the flow of a river.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.282 position:50% align:center
Dude, that's cool.

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:44.909 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
And it certainly suits Benimaru.

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.995 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA giggles]

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:48.288 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
So, on that note,

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.665 position:50% align:center
I've come up with
the perfect strategy.

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:51.791 position:50% align:center
Which is?

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.376 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Given the occasion.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.920 position:50% align:center
I thought we could also destroy
Clayman's castle that is rumored

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.464 position:50% align:center
to lie beyond the mist.

00:04:57.547 --> 00:05:00.467 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Given what occasion?
That seems kinda dangerous.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.801 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Not to worry.

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:04.471 position:50% align:center
Soei and Hakurou will be
the ones to infiltrate it.

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:05.513 position:50% align:center
And they are both eager to--

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:06.973 position:50% align:center
Wait a moment, Brother!

00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:09.976 position:50% align:center
Ah? Okay, what is it, Shuna?

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.644 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA]
Do you even have to ask?

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:14.356 position:50% align:center
The Demon Lord Clayman
possesses a very dangerous power

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.025 position:50% align:center
that allows him
to control others!

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:20.153 position:50% align:center
What if he were to then take
control of Soei or Hakurou?

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:22.113 position:50% align:center
He won't. They would
never fall to him--

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:24.074 position:50% align:center
--I refuse!
--[gasps]

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.951 position:50% align:center
If you insist on doing this...

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:28.620 position:50% align:center
...then I shall go with you.

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:29.788 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Whoa, slow down.

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:31.831 position:50% align:center
Please, this is my decision.

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:35.669 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru, I'm asking you to
grant me permission to deploy.

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:38.004 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU groans]

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:41.508 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I'd rather not
send Shuna into any danger.

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:43.009 position:50% align:center
Still though...

00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:45.303 position:50% align:center
Benimaru has a good point that
our best chance to attack

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:48.807 position:50% align:center
Clayman's castle will be
while he's away at Walpurgis.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.475 position:50% align:center
--Lord Rimuru.
--Waugh!

00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:52.477 position:50% align:center
You needn't worry
about the princess.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.854 position:50% align:center
I promise that I will
protect her with my life.

00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:56.731 position:50% align:center
And I'll be there,
as well, my lord.

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:59.234 position:50% align:center
I believe it's entirely possible
Lord Carrion is being held

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:00.652 position:50% align:center
in the enemy's castle.

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:03.488 position:50% align:center
It would seem an
investigation is necessary.

00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:06.408 position:50% align:center
Please let me go, Lord Rimuru,
I'm angry, too!

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:08.952 position:50% align:center
Like everyone in Tempest,
I want to see Clayman pay

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.328 position:50% align:center
for his crimes against us!

00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:13.957 position:50% align:center
Uh, look, I get it!
I definitely know how you feel.

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:19.295 position:50% align:center
Fine, Shuna, I'll allow you
to join Soei and Hakurou.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.172 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much!

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:24.801 position:50% align:center
Shuna's safety will be your
top priority. Am I clear?

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:25.969 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Thank you for accommodating

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:27.887 position:50% align:center
Shuna's selfish whims.

00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:29.723 position:50% align:center
Don't worry,
I can use Transport,

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:32.225 position:50% align:center
so if there's any trouble,
then I should be perfectly fine.

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:36.604 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's true. I'd likely be
slower to escape than Shuna.

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:37.856 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Hmm.

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:39.482 position:50% align:center
We already have
a comparable resistance

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:41.109 position:50% align:center
to mental attacks as it is.

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:43.778 position:50% align:center
It's unlikely we would be
in danger anyway.

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:46.614 position:50% align:center
But with Princess Shuna there,
we have no reason for concern.

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:48.658 position:50% align:center
As for Lord Carrion,
we'll decide what to do

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:50.035 position:50% align:center
once we locate him.

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:52.412 position:50% align:center
Make sure you're always
aware of your surroundings.

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:55.206 position:50% align:center
Our plan starts the moment
the new day begins.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.334 position:50% align:center
Right before Walpurgis
is set to commence.

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:58.335 position:50% align:center
Understand?

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:00.170 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Understood, sir.

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.589 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I've been meaning to
tell you that there're only

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:05.592 position:50% align:center
100 Dragon Faithful
among Clayman's forces.

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:07.761 position:50% align:center
Uh, should I know what
the Dragon Faithful are?

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:10.638 position:50% align:center
They are the people who worship
Milim, the Dragon Princess.

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:13.558 position:50% align:center
Oh, I get it now, so they're
like Milim's subordinates.

00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:16.061 position:50% align:center
Whoa, wait, she told me she
didn't have subordinates.

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:18.104 position:50% align:center
Which I guess would just
make them some randos

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:20.857 position:50% align:center
who are big fans
of her or something?

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.360 position:50% align:center
Well, I doubt a hundred
of them should be a problem.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:24.611 position:50% align:center
[SOEI]
Indeed.

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:26.696 position:50% align:center
Okay. Let's finish
getting you ready.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.781 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Mm?

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:30.116 position:50% align:center
Careful not to move
around too much!

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.577 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Uh?

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.162 position:50% align:center
Mm...

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.857 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] Just as we planned,
Clayman's forces are being lured

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:05.276 position:50% align:center
into the trap that Geld has set.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.320 position:50% align:center
We'll find it harder
to lose than to win.

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:09.072 position:50% align:center
The battle's as good as over.

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:10.657 position:50% align:center
Once the trap's been sprung,

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.952 position:50% align:center
the enemy forces will be too
devastated to recover properly.

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:15.578 position:50% align:center
You think so, Miss Albis?

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:18.039 position:50% align:center
Oh, please, feel free
to just call me Albis,

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:19.749 position:50% align:center
Sir Benimaru.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:21.918 position:50% align:center
But you're not
one of my subordinates.

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.837 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's certainly true.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.755 position:50% align:center
However, for the moment,
we Lycanthropes

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:28.341 position:50% align:center
are fully entrusting you with
the command of our ranks,

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:29.759 position:50% align:center
Sir Benimaru.

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.720 position:50% align:center
Understood. Well, then.

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:33.513 position:50% align:center
For the duration
of this campaign,

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:34.973 position:50% align:center
you shall be my aide.

00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:38.184 position:50% align:center
It would be my honor to help.
I accept your offer.

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:41.021 position:50% align:center
That being said, there isn't
that much work left to do.

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:44.024 position:50% align:center
At this point in time, our
victory is all but guaranteed.

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:46.693 position:50% align:center
Yes, I tend to agree with you.

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:50.155 position:50% align:center
However... It seems as though
a few powerful adversaries

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:51.865 position:50% align:center
still remain in their ranks.

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:53.450 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.994 position:50% align:center
We'll send in Geld's team once
we're sure of their strength.

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:57.203 position:50% align:center
[SUPHIA]
Hang on!

00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:59.456 position:50% align:center
It'd be better if we
handled that mission!

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:00.957 position:50% align:center
[PHOBIO]
Please, Supreme Commander!

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:02.876 position:50% align:center
This is the
Lycanthropes' homeland.

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
If we let you do everything,

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:06.963 position:50% align:center
Lord Carrion will be utterly
furious with us!

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:08.590 position:50% align:center
[ALBIS sighs]

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.218 position:50% align:center
Please, Sir Benimaru.

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:14.471 position:50% align:center
We will entrust the command
of the army to you,

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.181 position:50% align:center
but grant us permission.

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.224 position:50% align:center
And allow the three of us
to eliminate the leader

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:19.392 position:50% align:center
of the enemy's forces.

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:20.769 position:50% align:center
[SUPHIA, PHOBIO]
Please, sir!

00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:23.271 position:50% align:center
Tch! Did you let me lead
as supreme commander

00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:24.898 position:50% align:center
so you could do this?

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:28.610 position:50% align:center
Sorry? Whatever do you mean?

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:31.613 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Hmph. All right, then.

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:34.032 position:50% align:center
I'd planned to include
you three in the attack anyway,

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:35.909 position:50% align:center
so this only
solidifies the idea.

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:39.037 position:50% align:center
However, if it starts
to look like you can't win,

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.705 position:50% align:center
then you should withdraw.

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:43.500 position:50% align:center
We can't afford to be
careless with these fools.

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:46.378 position:50% align:center
[ALBIS]
Yes, we are well aware.

00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:48.713 position:50% align:center
The trap should be
activated pretty soon.

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:51.174 position:50% align:center
What will we do with those
who are caught in the trap?

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:52.884 position:50% align:center
I'd like to say kill them all,

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.427 position:50% align:center
but I don't feel like
that's my decision,

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:56.638 position:50% align:center
so I'm going to leave it up
to you guys, instead.

00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:58.223 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:09:58.306 --> 00:10:00.684 position:50% align:center
Anyone who loses the will
to fight will be taken prisoner.

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.060 position:50% align:center
[PHOBIO, SUPHIA gasp]

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:03.478 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
In the end,

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:05.980 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru likely intends
to make laborers of them.

00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:07.649 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:10.360 position:50% align:center
You all want to rebuild
your capital, don't you?

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:12.987 position:50% align:center
Then you'll need as
many hands as you can get.

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:15.990 position:50% align:center
--[gasping]
--He thought that far ahead?

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:17.450 position:50% align:center
[ALBIS] Even against the
henchmen of someone

00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:20.245 position:50% align:center
as cunning as Demon Lord
Clayman, he still planned ahead

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:22.038 position:50% align:center
to what would
follow our victory?

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:23.748 position:50% align:center
How is he so confident?

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:27.794 position:50% align:center
But... of course, that's only if
everything goes as we expect.

00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:31.798 position:50% align:center
It's time.

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:34.050 position:50% align:center
Now, Geld. It's your move.

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:35.427 position:50% align:center
[GELD]
Understood.

00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:37.762 position:50% align:center

Let us begin!

Yes, sir!

Don't let a single man escape!

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
Okay, we're on it!

[bellows]

I expected a bit more
of a challenge.

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:57.092 position:50% align:center
We've won.

00:11:57.175 --> 00:11:59.636 position:50% align:center
That was brilliant. Nicely done.

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:01.680 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Hmph. Yes, of course.

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:04.015 position:50% align:center
But we still can't
get too reckless.

00:12:04.099 --> 00:12:06.309 position:50% align:center
After all, we have
a big job left to do.

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:09.521 position:50% align:center
Albis, Suphia, Phobio,
starting now--

00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:11.731 position:50% align:center
I permit the three of you
to act on your own.

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:14.275 position:50% align:center
So go and defeat
the enemy leader!

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:15.694 position:50% align:center
I've been waiting to hear that!

00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:18.071 position:50% align:center
Heck yeah! We finally get
to go bust some heads!

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:20.532 position:50% align:center
I can even smell the
bastards who framed me.

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:22.367 position:50% align:center
You can bet that
I'm going after them first.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:23.743 position:50% align:center
Yes, I will fight as well.

00:12:23.827 --> 00:12:25.662 position:50% align:center
We leave the rest
to you, Sir Benimaru.

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:26.955 position:50% align:center
Do your best out there.

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:28.164 position:50% align:center
Then, go!

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:29.624 position:50% align:center
[BEASTKETEERS]
Yes, sir!

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS yelling,
swords clanging]

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:47.642 position:50% align:center
[GABIRU laughs] The Dragonnewts
will assist you, Lady Suphia!

00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:49.519 position:50% align:center
Hey, Gabiru! Thanks a lot!

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:51.229 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I fear
that you might end up

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:52.522 position:50% align:center
drawing the short straw.

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:53.773 position:50% align:center
We're more than ready!

00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:55.525 position:50% align:center

Prepare yourselves!

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:56.860 position:50% align:center
[SUKERO, YASHICHI]
Yes, sir!

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:58.278 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:01.322 position:50% align:center
--[GABIRU] Hmph!
--[YASHICHI] Yeah!

00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:12.375 position:50% align:center
[HERMES] Father Middray,
this looks bad...

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:16.046 position:50% align:center
Real bad. It would appear
we're fighting a losing battle.

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:17.756 position:50% align:center
We thought we'd gotten
the jump on them,

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:20.342 position:50% align:center
but once it started,
we were already behind.

00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:22.177 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY groans]
Oh... Weak!

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.888 position:50% align:center
They are far too weak.

00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:29.476 position:50% align:center
Lord Clayman's men
are this pathetic?!

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:31.186 position:50% align:center
Why send us such
weak soldiers?

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:32.937 position:50% align:center
[HERMES] No, no!
They're really not that bad!

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:36.024 position:50% align:center
It just so happens our enemy
had a much better strategy!

00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:38.568 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY] Fool! If they're
using underhanded strategies,

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.987 position:50% align:center
then we can simply break
through them with sheer force!

00:13:41.071 --> 00:13:43.490 position:50% align:center
[HERMES] That might work for
personal feuds and quarrels,

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:45.575 position:50% align:center
but victory in a war
between armies this size

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:48.203 position:50% align:center
will ultimately come down
to leadership skills!

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:49.788 position:50% align:center
The enemy had
a trap prepared for us,

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:51.414 position:50% align:center
so of course they'll win.

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY] Hmph. I don't need you
to state the obvious, Hermes.

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:56.670 position:50% align:center
Besides, anyone could figure
that out just by looking.

00:13:56.753 --> 00:13:57.712 position:50% align:center
[HERMES]
More importantly--

00:13:57.796 --> 00:13:59.798 position:50% align:center
I know, idiot.

00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:03.551 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY]
They are strong.

00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:05.095 position:50% align:center
This isn't what I wanted.

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:07.597 position:50% align:center
But if they are coming for us,
then we have little choice.

00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:09.766 position:50% align:center
We'll have to take them
on ourselves.

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:13.103 position:50% align:center
You're really into this, huh?

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:16.314 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
Understood, Father.

00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:29.202 position:50% align:center
Gotcha.

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:30.662 position:50% align:center
Heh!

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:36.876 position:50% align:center
Hey. You took great
care of me last time.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.131 position:50% align:center
If it isn't Tear the Teardrop
and Footman the Angry Pierrot.

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:42.632 position:50% align:center
[FOOTMAN]
Well, hello!

00:14:42.716 --> 00:14:45.719 position:50% align:center
Why, it's such a pleasure
to see you again, Sir Phobio!

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:48.930 position:50% align:center
[TEAR] Sir Phobio, the guy who
failed to become a Demon Lord!

00:14:49.014 --> 00:14:52.892 position:50% align:center
Sir Phobio, the guy who got
his butt kicked by Lady Milim!

00:14:52.976 --> 00:14:54.394 position:50% align:center
Back then...

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:57.731 position:50% align:center
...you did such a wonderful
job for us. Thank ya, honey!

00:14:57.814 --> 00:15:01.317 position:50% align:center
Heh. I'm glad to see you guys
haven't forgotten about me.

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:04.404 position:50% align:center
I would've felt real terrible if
you didn't know why I came here.

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:06.448 position:50% align:center
I hope you're ready
to die, clowns.

00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:09.826 position:50% align:center
[TEAR] What's this?
Why in the world is he so angry?

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:11.661 position:50% align:center
[FOOTMAN]
It's a mystery.

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:14.914 position:50% align:center
Oh! Perhaps he's upset
because he's such a fool?

00:15:14.998 --> 00:15:17.250 position:50% align:center
[TEAR]
I don't know! Could be the case!

00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:19.336 position:50% align:center
[FOOTMAN] While his outrage
is certainly delicious,

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:22.130 position:50% align:center
I see no reason why we should
have to be killed just because

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:24.257 position:50% align:center
he fell for our silly trick.

00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:25.800 position:50% align:center
[TEAR]
For sure! For sure!

00:15:25.884 --> 00:15:27.135 position:50% align:center
[PHOBIO]
Shut up!

00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:29.679 position:50% align:center
Look, I know I was an idiot
to let you trick me.

00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:31.931 position:50% align:center
But fortunately for me
and unfortunately for you,

00:15:32.015 --> 00:15:34.059 position:50% align:center
idiots don't need
a reason to get even!

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:37.312 position:50% align:center
[TEAR] Oh, wow, you're
really pickin' a fight?

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:40.106 position:50% align:center
But you're so weak!
Don't hurt yourself!

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:41.900 position:50% align:center
[FOOTMAN laughs]

00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:43.568 position:50% align:center
Don't be so mean, Tear.

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:46.529 position:50% align:center
After all, Sir Phobio did his
best to come up with a joke

00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:48.365 position:50% align:center
to try and make us laugh.

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:49.949 position:50% align:center

Hi there, piggy...

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:11.429 position:50% align:center
Hello again, Footman.
Tell me, do you remember me?

00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:14.349 position:50% align:center
[FOOTMAN] If memory serves,
you are the Orc General, yes?

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:17.435 position:50% align:center
My goodness, you certainly
look more impressive now!

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:21.564 position:50% align:center
Sir Benimaru ordered me
to come here.

00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:22.857 position:50% align:center
To help you.

00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:25.527 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot, Geld!
Much obliged!

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:41.334 position:50% align:center
is in the forest to the east!

00:16:41.418 --> 00:16:43.670 position:50% align:center
What?! The Three Beastketeers?

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:45.171 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA]
What now?

00:16:45.255 --> 00:16:47.924 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll have to rely on
Adalman, the Index Finger.

00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:50.176 position:50% align:center
But I sincerely doubt there's
a way we can get Adalman

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.679 position:50% align:center
all the way out here
on such short notice.

00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:54.305 position:50% align:center
We're past the point
where we can even talk

00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center
about bouncing back.

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:59.894 position:50% align:center
Lord Clayman only acknowledges
his most capable subordinates.

00:16:59.978 --> 00:17:02.856 position:50% align:center
The moment our loss is assured,
even if I make it back alive,

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:04.232 position:50% align:center
I'll just be executed.

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:06.067 position:50% align:center
If I somehow found
a way to survive,

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:07.777 position:50% align:center
there's still the possibility
I'd be turned into

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:10.739 position:50% align:center
a soulless puppet,
and I don't want that.

00:17:10.822 --> 00:17:14.826 position:50% align:center
Which, of course, means that my
safety is now my top priority.

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:18.371 position:50% align:center
As much as it annoys me, I'll
admit defeat in this battle.

00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:19.706 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:21.541 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA] But no matter what,
I will be the one

00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:24.085 position:50% align:center
who's victorious at the end.

00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:25.295 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA]
Buy us time.

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:27.088 position:50% align:center
I'm going to return
home for a bit.

00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:28.757 position:50% align:center
I need to go fetch Adalman.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:29.758 position:50% align:center
Adalman?!

00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:31.384 position:50% align:center
As in, the Wight King, Adalman?

00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:34.721 position:50% align:center
Hold on, but he can't leave
his current location, can he?

00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:37.182 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA] True, but Adalman can
summon the spirits of the dead

00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:38.975 position:50% align:center
to rebuild our forces.

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:41.311 position:50% align:center
I will get his aid,
whatever it takes.

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:43.772 position:50% align:center
I'm leaving you in charge
while I'm away.

00:17:43.855 --> 00:17:45.315 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL 43A]
Uh. Yes, sir!

00:17:47.609 --> 00:17:50.028 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA] Since I
voluntarily swore loyalty,

00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
I'm not under constant watch,
like the other Fingers

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.865 position:50% align:center
in Lord Clayman's command.

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:56.076 position:50% align:center
If I cover my tracks well,
then even Lord Clayman

00:17:56.159 --> 00:17:57.994 position:50% align:center
won't be able to follow me.

00:17:58.078 --> 00:17:59.746 position:50% align:center
I'd love to be at the top
of the Five Fingers,

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:02.332 position:50% align:center
but I can't do that if I'm dead.

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:05.210 position:50% align:center
If I curry favor with
some other Demon Lord...

00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:09.756 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA gasps]

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:16.388 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA gasps] My transport
magic won't activate?!

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:18.348 position:50% align:center
Is it spatial interference?

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:21.351 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA grunts]
Hey! The enemy is near--

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:23.436 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.397 position:50% align:center
Paralysis, poison,

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.315 position:50% align:center
and petrification?!

00:18:27.399 --> 00:18:30.944 position:50% align:center
Impossible! They were
just fine a moment ago!

00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:34.614 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 43G shrieks]

00:18:44.499 --> 00:18:46.751 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA gasps]
Albis!

00:18:48.253 --> 00:18:52.632 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA] That means this entire
area is under her control now!

00:18:52.716 --> 00:18:54.009 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA growls]

00:18:58.263 --> 00:18:59.305 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA]
Very well.

00:18:59.389 --> 00:19:01.641 position:50% align:center
I'll give you
a worthy fight, Albis!

00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:07.022 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA]
I have to survive this...

00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:10.608 position:50% align:center
...and make my comeback,
regardless of the cost!

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:12.861 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA]
Albis, greatest of all the majin

00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:15.071 position:50% align:center
in Demon Lord Carrion's service.

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:16.948 position:50% align:center
As one of the intrepid
Three Beastketeers,

00:19:17.032 --> 00:19:20.118 position:50% align:center
you will agree to a one-on-one
battle with me, will you not?

00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:22.245 position:50% align:center
Yes. I look forward to it,

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:24.914 position:50% align:center
Yamza the Magic Swordsman
of Ice, of the Five Fingers

00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:27.542 position:50% align:center
in service to
Demon Lord Clayman.

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:29.836 position:50% align:center
It will be a great joy to
demonstrate the difference

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.379 position:50% align:center
in our skill levels.

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:32.922 position:50% align:center
And through our battle,

00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:35.425 position:50% align:center
I will finally show you how
superior Demon Lord Carrion is

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:37.135 position:50% align:center
compared to Clayman.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.769 position:50% align:center

[ALBIS grunts]

00:19:51.483 --> 00:19:52.400 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA]
Heh!

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:54.069 position:50% align:center
Hyah!

00:19:54.152 --> 00:19:55.111 position:50% align:center
[ALBIS]
Hah!

00:19:55.195 --> 00:19:56.738 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA growls]

00:19:57.947 --> 00:19:59.240 position:50% align:center

00:19:59.324 --> 00:20:01.284 position:50% align:center

Hmph!

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:03.411 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA]
Heh, heh!

00:20:03.495 --> 00:20:05.205 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS yelling]

00:20:05.288 --> 00:20:08.500 position:50% align:center
[ALBIS] Fiend! Your pathetic
plan won't work on me!

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:10.835 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS gasping]

00:20:15.757 --> 00:20:17.759 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA]
You're mine!

--[YAMZA gasps]
--[ALBIS gasps]

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:27.018 position:50% align:center
[GOBTA] You know, a cowardly
move like that isn't very manly.

00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:29.938 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA] Damn it!
Who the hell are you?!

00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:31.773 position:50% align:center
The name's Gobta!

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:33.733 position:50% align:center
And yeah, I was
hiding nearby in case

00:20:33.817 --> 00:20:35.860 position:50% align:center
something like this happened!

00:20:39.364 --> 00:20:41.741 position:50% align:center
[ALBIS] My. Even I
didn't know about this.

00:20:41.825 --> 00:20:43.576 position:50% align:center
Although, it would certainly
explain why I sensed

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.078 position:50% align:center
something unusual.

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:47.580 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Uh, sorry about that,
but it was a direct order

00:20:47.664 --> 00:20:49.124 position:50% align:center
from Benimaru!

00:20:49.207 --> 00:20:52.127 position:50% align:center
Besides, you totally noticed us
from the start, didn't you?

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:55.171 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA] Weakling!
Stay out of my way!

00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:58.591 position:50% align:center
[GOBTA]
Hah!

00:21:02.762 --> 00:21:06.016 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA] No way! His power is
as great as my ice sword's?!

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:08.476 position:50% align:center
Impertinent little weakling!

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.769 position:50% align:center
[GOBTA]
This isn't good.

00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:11.604 position:50% align:center
I held him off because he
happened to use magic,

00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:14.899 position:50% align:center
but if he stabs me with
that ice sword, I'm a goner!

00:21:14.983 --> 00:21:17.569 position:50% align:center
I can just run
away now, can't I?

00:21:17.652 --> 00:21:20.280 position:50% align:center
You guys mop up
the remaining enemy majin!

00:21:20.363 --> 00:21:21.740 position:50% align:center
But Yamza is pretty strong,
so don't me--

--[gasping]
--Ah!

00:21:25.452 --> 00:21:27.954 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA] That runt actually
dodged my attack?!

00:21:28.038 --> 00:21:29.706 position:50% align:center
[GOBTA]
Whoa, that was too close!

00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:34.544 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA laughs] Planting helpers
for a one-on-one fight?

00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:36.671 position:50% align:center
How far the Three
Beastketeers have fallen.

00:21:36.755 --> 00:21:38.506 position:50% align:center
[GOBTA] Hold up!
I volunteer to be the referee

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.383 position:50% align:center
for this one-on-one fight!

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:41.718 position:50% align:center
[GOBTA]
Thank goodness!

00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:43.553 position:50% align:center
Now I won't have to battle
against that scary majin

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:45.096 position:50% align:center
and his stupid ice sword!

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.264 position:50% align:center
Oh? Hmph.

00:21:46.348 --> 00:21:48.475 position:50% align:center
I'd be willing
to concede to you.

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:50.643 position:50% align:center
[GOBTA] No, no! I'll be
the one to hold back here!

00:21:50.727 --> 00:21:53.438 position:50% align:center
You just go out there and
fight to your heart's content!

00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:55.940 position:50% align:center
Sorry for interrupting!

00:21:56.024 --> 00:21:57.400 position:50% align:center
[ALBIS chuckles]

00:21:59.027 --> 00:22:00.904 position:50% align:center
[GOBTA]
Hooray, I'm saved!

00:22:00.987 --> 00:22:02.530 position:50% align:center
At least I did my job.

00:22:02.614 --> 00:22:04.407 position:50% align:center
Not to be a pessimist,
but there's no way

00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:06.117 position:50% align:center
that I would have won!
