00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.771 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] As Benimaru
and the others were facing off

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.941 position:50% align:center
against Clayman's forces,
the rest of us back in Tempest

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:28.278 position:50% align:center
were busy making preparations
to attend Walpurgis.

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.905 position:50% align:center
My goodness, you look
fantastic, Lord Rimuru.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.532 position:50% align:center
Agreed, just wonderful!

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:34.242 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Such a dignified look!

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:36.161 position:50% align:center
It suits you perfectly, Master!

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:37.787 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm!

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.456 position:50% align:center
Aw, you really think so?

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.417 position:50% align:center
[SHION] And Princess Shuna,
you're looking lovely, as well!

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.671 position:50% align:center
Ah? Thank you so much!

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:49.466 position:50% align:center
On that note, I should
probably join the others.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.051 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Mm.

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:53.303 position:50% align:center
Princess Shuna, be careful out
there, but also make sure

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.680 position:50% align:center
you beat the stuffing out of
Clayman's minions!

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:57.349 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Do it for us!

00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:58.933 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:00.518 position:50% align:center
Stay safe, okay?

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:02.854 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA]
I will, and you, as well.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.649 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
Hmm!

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:09.361 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Hmm?

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.239 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:15.241 position:50% align:center
[TREYNI giggles]

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:17.035 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] It's almost time
to go to Walpurgis,

00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:19.454 position:50% align:center
but they're just chilling
like it's no big deal.

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:23.333 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Hey, so there are ten
Demon Lords in total, right?

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:27.837 position:50% align:center
There's Milim, Ramiris, Leon,
Carrion, Frey, and Clayman,

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.298 position:50% align:center
but I have no clue what
the other four are like.

00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:33.593 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I have little interest
in such small insects.

00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:36.596 position:50% align:center
But, two or three millennia ago,
I don't recall the details,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.973 position:50% align:center
I fought a female
vampire Demon Lord.

00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:40.266 position:50% align:center
What do you remember?

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.727 position:50% align:center
Well, for starters,
she could not take a joke.

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:45.939 position:50% align:center
I burnt down one tiny city
and she got all furious at me.

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:48.400 position:50% align:center
Yeah, pretty sure that
would make anyone furious.

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:51.361 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA gulps] Oh? I suppose
looking back at it now,

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.363 position:50% align:center
I might feel a teensy bit
bad about it...

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:55.365 position:50% align:center
Just a teensy bit, huh?

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:57.367 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
What was her name again?

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.329 position:50% align:center
Lu... Lurus...?
Or Milis, maybe?

00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:03.081 position:50% align:center
I wasn't really
taking it seriously,

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:05.500 position:50% align:center
but she was strong enough
to be a playmate for me,

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:07.544 position:50% align:center
so you'd better be
careful around her.

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.963 position:50% align:center
I doubt it matters now, but
a man named Roy Valentine

00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:13.216 position:50% align:center
has been the Demon Lord of that
nation for like 1,500 years.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.926 position:50% align:center
So, he's like her replacement?

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.428 position:50% align:center
--Ah!
--What is it?!

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:19.305 position:50% align:center
I can't believe a new enemy is
showing up in this moment!

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.391 position:50% align:center
Talk about an
unexpected cliffhanger!

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:24.019 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Take this seriously or
I'll start shouting spoilers!

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:26.563 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Come on, there's
no need for such threats!

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.565 position:50% align:center
There's also a Demon Lord
who's a giant.

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:30.108 position:50% align:center
His name is Daggrull.

00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:33.486 position:50% align:center
We tussled a few times, but a
victor was never determined.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.238 position:50% align:center
Sure, but if you actually
remember his name,

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.407 position:50% align:center
then I imagine
he's pretty powerful.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.952 position:50% align:center
Hardly, and if I fought him
now, I would definitely win.

00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:43.455 position:50% align:center
Also, I never battled him,
but there's a Demon Lord

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:46.291 position:50% align:center
who's an actual real-life
demon called Guy Crimson.

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:48.043 position:50% align:center
So why haven't you
ever fought him?

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:49.919 position:50% align:center
Oh, he lives way up
in the far north,

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.172 position:50% align:center
and there is absolutely no
reason for someone as amazing

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:54.215 position:50% align:center
as I am to venture
to such a remote land

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.717 position:50% align:center
just for some silly fight.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.469 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:02:57.552 --> 00:03:00.972 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's true.
Plus, Guy is really strong.

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:02.515 position:50% align:center
Did you know Guy, Milim,
and I are the oldest

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.018 position:50% align:center
of all the Demon Lords? Ha, ha!

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:07.520 position:50% align:center
Ah. I guess that's good to know.

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:09.189 position:50% align:center
Who's the last Demon Lord?

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:10.190 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS]
Hmm...

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:11.691 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:13.109 position:50% align:center
I've got nothing.

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:14.611 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS]
His name's Deeno!

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.780 position:50% align:center
The guy does nothing but
sleep and loves slacking off

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:17.989 position:50% align:center
even more than I do!

00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:20.325 position:50% align:center
I gotcha, so he's
another Ramiris?

00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:23.244 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS]
Ah! Yeah, right, he wishes!

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:24.329 position:50% align:center
That's ten.

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:25.330 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:26.331 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:27.749 position:50% align:center
The time has come.

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:29.459 position:50% align:center
Yep, that's our ride!

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:36.424 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
What's with this design?

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:38.468 position:50% align:center
Talk about dramatic.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:46.101 position:50% align:center
Hello, I've come to
collect you, Lady Ramiris.

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:47.185 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
This maid...

00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:49.729 position:50% align:center
She's just as
intimidating as Diablo.

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:52.816 position:50% align:center
She must be a demon,
and a high-ranking one.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.776 position:50% align:center
It's been a while, Mizeri!

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.695 position:50% align:center
How's your partner,
Raine, doing?

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
As well as ever,
thank you for asking.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:01.449 position:50% align:center
And I assume you're Lord Rimuru?

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:02.450 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Mm.

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:03.743 position:50% align:center
[MIZERI]
I've heard about you.

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:06.246 position:50% align:center
From my master,
Lord Guy Crimson.

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.165 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] She serves Guy,
one of the oldest Demon Lords?

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.126 position:50% align:center
[MIZERI] Please proceed
once you're ready.

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.045 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS] Beretta, Treyni,
Let's get moving!

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.755 position:50% align:center
[TREYNI]
Of course, Lady Ramiris.

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.298 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA]
Coming, my lady.

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:19.926 position:50% align:center
[TRYA]
Lady Ramiris. Be careful.

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:23.096 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Waiting beyond that door,

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:26.266 position:50% align:center
are the people
who control this world.

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.934 position:50% align:center
But now that I've made up
my mind to become

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:31.771 position:50% align:center
a true Demon Lord,
I can't afford to lose my nerve.

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:33.440 position:50% align:center
Time to go.

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:34.899 position:50% align:center
[SHION, RANGA]
Right!

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:43.533 position:50% align:center
[TRYA] Lord Rimuru,
and the rest of you, as well.

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:45.118 position:50% align:center
Please stay safe.

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:48.288 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] If anything happens,
feel free to give me a shout!

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:30.640 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU]
Where is Clayman's castle?

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:32.767 position:50% align:center
This fog is much
more than it appears--

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:35.311 position:50% align:center
it's even blocking
my Magic Detection.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.605 position:50% align:center
Agreed, the enemy
is clearly using the fog

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:39.733 position:50% align:center
to obtain information.

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:48.074 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA gasps]

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:49.659 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU]
Hmm?

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:52.162 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA] Unfortunately, I believe
we have just walked into a trap.

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:53.455 position:50% align:center
You don't say?

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:55.123 position:50% align:center
Strange, I don't
sense any enemies.

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:56.124 position:50% align:center
[moaning]

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:57.542 position:50% align:center
[SOEI gasps]
What?

00:06:57.625 --> 00:07:01.171 position:50% align:center
[UNDEAD moaning]

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.715 position:50% align:center
How, though?
There are so many.

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:05.425 position:50% align:center
How could they possibly
hide so that we didn't

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:07.135 position:50% align:center
sense their presence?

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:09.763 position:50% align:center
It was never the enemy's
intention to hide.

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:12.974 position:50% align:center
Rather the fog was used
to lure us to them.

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.934 position:50% align:center
Into the center of their army.

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:16.644 position:50% align:center
[SOEI]
With Magic Detection unusable,

00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:19.230 position:50% align:center
we have no way to know
how many there are.

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:21.733 position:50% align:center
But if sheer numbers are
their only advantage...

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:24.527 position:50% align:center
Listen up. I will break
through their forces

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.029 position:50% align:center
while you and Hakurou escape.

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:28.031 position:50% align:center
--We can't, Soei.
--[SOEI] Hmm?

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:31.117 position:50% align:center
It does not appear they
will make it so simple.

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:38.124 position:50% align:center
His magical power
is quite immense.

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:40.543 position:50% align:center
I see, that can
only mean one thing.

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:43.004 position:50% align:center
[SOEI] He's one of the Five
Fingers serving Clayman.

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:45.256 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA]
Adalmann, the Index Finger.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.009 position:50% align:center
[ADALMANN] Correct.
I'm the one known as Adalmann.

00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:52.055 position:50% align:center
the Wight King who dares to
command a multitude of undead.

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:55.100 position:50% align:center
I am a servant of the
Great Demon Lord Clayman,

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:57.894 position:50% align:center
and the one he has ordered
to protect this land.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:07:59.688 position:50% align:center
Lowly intruders.

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:00.897 position:50% align:center
There is no escape.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.025 position:50% align:center
Give up your lives quietly.

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:06.152 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA]
We are fully surrounded.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.281 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA] And I can no longer
use Spatial Movement.

00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:12.033 position:50% align:center
The only way out of this...

00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:13.910 position:50% align:center
...is to defeat Adalmann.

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:15.620 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU]
Let's end it quickly.

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:16.955 position:50% align:center
[SOEI]
I'm with you.

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:19.249 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, my attacks
can kill even the undead.

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:22.919 position:50% align:center
[ADALMANN laughs] None of
you idiots know your place!

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:25.046 position:50% align:center
You will pay for your ignorance!

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.631 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU]
Hmph!

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:30.927 position:50% align:center
How impressive. You managed
to predict all my moves.

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:33.221 position:50% align:center
I see that even as a rotting
corpse, you've still retained

A Dragon Zombie?

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.692 position:50% align:center
No, I'm afraid it's
nothing that weak!

of all dead monsters.

Rest in peace.

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:17.849 position:50% align:center
[SOEI] I see. So, you have
the ability to regenerate.

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:20.268 position:50% align:center
Then I have little choice but
to destroy your physical body

00:09:20.352 --> 00:09:21.728 position:50% align:center
along with your soul.

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.813 position:50% align:center

This dragon's soul...

...exists within
Adalmann himself.

Please do not worry
about trying to protect me.

No, it's too dangerous.

Do you see?

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:48.129 position:50% align:center
I'm very angry.

intend to do, little lady?

to achieve without relying

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:33.049 position:50% align:center

Ah. Yes, nicely done.

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:05.498 position:50% align:center
I must say, I'm impressed you
figured out my secret, as well.

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:07.417 position:50% align:center
Tell me, girl. Your name?

Shuna. Yes, Miss Shuna.

00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:15.383 position:50% align:center
Very well, let us
commence our battle.

Should you somehow
manage to defeat me,

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:19.304 position:50% align:center
I will do whatever you wish.

00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:22.349 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA] I see, that's a very
generous offer on your part.

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:23.975 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately for you,

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:26.770 position:50% align:center
our only wish is the fall
of Demon Lord Clayman.

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:29.981 position:50% align:center
If you kindly let us pass,
we will allow you to continue

[laughs] I'm so sorry,
young lady, but I do believe

00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:36.404 position:50% align:center
that will be impossible.

00:11:36.488 --> 00:11:38.198 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:41.534 position:50% align:center
I thought you would be capable
of breaking that binding spell.

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:44.662 position:50% align:center
It seems I overestimated
your abilities.

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:46.664 position:50% align:center
Rest assured, if I could
break this binding spell,

00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:48.541 position:50% align:center
then I would have
done so by now.

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:51.169 position:50% align:center
You make it sound as if
it would be a simple matter.

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:53.755 position:50% align:center
Right, then as I planned...

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:56.341 position:50% align:center
...I shall defeat you
in battle, Adalmann.

than welcome to fight me with

[bells ringing]

00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:37.090 position:50% align:center
[ADALMANN] Impossible!
That's a Divine Miracle!

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:39.050 position:50% align:center
How is it that a lowly
monster such as yourself

00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:41.594 position:50% align:center
could possibly use holy magic?

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:43.263 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA]
You find it strange?

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:45.557 position:50% align:center
That's because you
are so close-minded.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.184 position:50% align:center
It should be no surprise to you,
holy magic responds to

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:49.811 position:50% align:center
the strength of the wish.

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:53.106 position:50% align:center
It works for anyone who believes
in miracles and wishes.

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:55.817 position:50% align:center

[ADALMANN]
Once upon a time,

00:12:57.193 --> 00:13:00.321 position:50% align:center
I was betrayed by the top
leaders of Luminism.

00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:03.783 position:50% align:center
I ultimately lost all my
faith in the god Luminus.

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:05.994 position:50% align:center
Back when I was
reduced to this form,

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:07.871 position:50% align:center
I was positive that I would
never be able to use

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:09.789 position:50% align:center
holy magic again.

00:13:09.873 --> 00:13:13.418 position:50% align:center
And now this girl is telling me
that isn't the case?!

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:16.171 position:50% align:center
[ADALMANN] Miss Shuna,
why did you believe I was once

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:18.590 position:50% align:center
a user of holy magic?

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:20.175 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA]
Your appearance.

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:22.927 position:50% align:center
It's common knowledge that those
pure white robes are only donned

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:25.305 position:50% align:center
by the highest members
of the clergy.

00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:27.349 position:50% align:center
Your magic was advanced
enough to earn you the right

00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:30.268 position:50% align:center
to wear them. Yet you're so weak
that you lack the ability

00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:32.354 position:50% align:center
to break a basic
binding spell.

00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:33.897 position:50% align:center
[ADALMANN growls]

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
If you only wear those white
robes because you miss having

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:39.694 position:50% align:center
holy magic, perhaps it was
foolish to be wary of you.

00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:42.989 position:50% align:center
[ADALMANN growls]
That's quite enough girl--

00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:45.575 position:50% align:center
I will hear no more out of you!

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:48.578 position:50% align:center
Please hear me now, God, for I
lift this prayer up to thee!

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:52.374 position:50% align:center
I ask you to share the divine
power of the Holy Spirit!

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.420 position:50% align:center
I beseech you, God:
please hear my wish!

00:13:57.504 --> 00:14:01.007 position:50% align:center
[ADALMANN] Of course. My resolve
was merely insufficient.

00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:03.218 position:50% align:center
When my old compatriots
who admired me came back

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:07.138 position:50% align:center
as the undead, I couldn't bear
to die and leave them behind.

00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:08.515 position:50% align:center
I was naïve!

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:12.143 position:50% align:center
But if I plead sincerely for
my wish to be granted...

00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:15.188 position:50% align:center
I bear no grudge against
this girl called Shuna.

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:17.857 position:50% align:center
If anything, I feel gratitude
for this monster who opened

00:14:17.941 --> 00:14:19.442 position:50% align:center
my eyes to the truth.

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:22.821 position:50% align:center
Because of the curse of the man
who bound me to these lands,

00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:25.073 position:50% align:center
the one known as
Demon Lord Kazalim,

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:27.283 position:50% align:center
I am forbidden from
taking my own life.

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:28.743 position:50% align:center
Forgive me, Miss Shuna,

00:14:28.827 --> 00:14:31.621 position:50% align:center
but I shall have to
take you with me!

00:14:31.705 --> 00:14:33.456 position:50% align:center
[ADALMANN]
Put an end to this battle!

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.542 position:50% align:center
Disintegration!

00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:37.043 position:50% align:center

What? But how?!

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:52.559 position:50% align:center
How in the world did she
overwrite my magic?!

00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:55.979 position:50% align:center
Excellent work. As a reward
for your sincere efforts,

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:58.606 position:50% align:center
I shall set you free
from this land.

You did very well,

Thanks, at least it's over.

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:35.393 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU]
My goodness.

00:15:35.477 --> 00:15:37.395 position:50% align:center
I must admit, the Death Knights
were far more trouble

00:15:37.479 --> 00:15:38.980 position:50% align:center
than I expected.

00:15:39.064 --> 00:15:41.358 position:50% align:center
I do believe you saved
my life, Princess Shuna.

00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:44.402 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't be silly--it was you
who saved me, Hakurou.

00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:45.987 position:50% align:center
And you as well, Soei.

00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:48.490 position:50% align:center
You did wonderfully buying me
time against that Death Dragon

00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:50.033 position:50% align:center
so I could fight.

00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:52.243 position:50% align:center
[SOEI] Though. It shames me
that I was unable to defeat it

00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:53.953 position:50% align:center
on my own.

00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:55.497 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU, SHUNA sigh]

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.124 position:50% align:center
Yes, and it would seem
I let my anger drive me to be

00:15:58.208 --> 00:16:00.585 position:50% align:center
a little too reckless
in this situation.

00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:02.337 position:50% align:center
Right, I tend to agree.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.006 position:50% align:center
I suppose it's possible our
newfound strength has caused us

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.591 position:50% align:center
to grow a bit conceited.

00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:08.635 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru's concern
was well-founded--

00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:11.513 position:50% align:center
one never knows what sorts of
things may happen in war.

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:15.600 position:50% align:center
I should have gathered more
information before we started.

Well...

00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:28.988 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU] Hm? Ah,
so you're still standing?

00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:30.532 position:50% align:center
Fine, then I shall
finish the job.

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:32.492 position:50% align:center
Stay your sword, Hakurou!

00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:36.371 position:50% align:center
He's harmless. He no longer
has the will to fight.

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:39.082 position:50% align:center
[ADALMANN]
Lady Shuna...

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:40.834 position:50% align:center
"Lady"...?

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:44.295 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:46.047 position:50% align:center
[ADALMANN] Thanks to your
magic and generosity,

00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:48.216 position:50% align:center
my compatriots and I have
been freed from the curse

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:49.718 position:50% align:center
binding us to this land.

00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:52.220 position:50% align:center
Surely, this means there was
a reason for our inability

00:16:52.303 --> 00:16:55.140 position:50% align:center
to pass on, so I wish
to ask a favor of you!

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:57.434 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA]
Huh...? What is it...?

00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:59.102 position:50% align:center
[ADALMANN] Lady Shuna,
I would like to meet the one

00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:01.604 position:50% align:center
that you have chosen to
place your faith in.

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:04.232 position:50% align:center
When I lost my faith, I also
lost the chance to regain

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:05.984 position:50% align:center
the power I enjoyed at my peak.

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:07.610 position:50% align:center
The faith I had
in the god Luminus

00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:09.487 position:50% align:center
has long since disappeared.

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:11.239 position:50% align:center
And for that reason,
my wish is to discover

00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:13.074 position:50% align:center
a new god to worship.

00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:15.618 position:50% align:center
Yes, well, he isn't
exactly a god.

00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
And while we have a great amount
of respect for Lord Rimuru,

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:20.957 position:50% align:center
I would never say that
we outright worship him.

00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:23.626 position:50% align:center
Oh! So, his name
is Lord Rimuru, is it?

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.628 position:50% align:center
How exciting--I dare say
there has never been

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:28.340 position:50% align:center
a more wonderful name
befitting of our new god!

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:29.632 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA chuckles]

00:17:29.716 --> 00:17:31.968 position:50% align:center
I may be nothing more than
a weakened skeleton,

00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:33.970 position:50% align:center
but it is my most humble
of hopes that I can still

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:36.222 position:50% align:center
be of use to your
master somehow.

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:38.183 position:50% align:center
Would it be at all possible
for you to introduce us

00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:40.727 position:50% align:center
to this Lord Rimuru, my lady?

00:17:42.437 --> 00:17:45.607 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA chuckles]
Mm...

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:46.816 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Boing!

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.444 position:50% align:center
Boi-oi-oi-oi-oi-oi-oing!

00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:52.447 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA]
Well, why not?

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.991 position:50% align:center
Perhaps once he meets
Lord Rimuru, in the "flesh,"

00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:57.535 position:50% align:center
he'll give up on his pursuits.

00:17:57.619 --> 00:17:59.120 position:50% align:center
Sure, I don't mind.

00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:01.873 position:50% align:center
[ADALMANN gasps]
Thank you so much!

00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:03.416 position:50% align:center
You'll have to be
patient, though.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.626 position:50% align:center
[ADALMANN]
Huh?

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:06.002 position:50% align:center
You see, we still have
an important mission

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:08.880 position:50% align:center
that we must carry out.

00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:12.384 position:50% align:center
Ah! Yes! Then, please
allow me to guide you.

00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:13.551 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA]
Hmm?!

00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:16.638 position:50% align:center
Have no fear, my friends,
just follow me!

00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:18.431 position:50% align:center
Hmm?

00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:20.141 position:50% align:center
Right this way.

00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:21.685 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA]
Uh...

00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:31.069 position:50% align:center
[MIZERI]
Here you are, sir.

00:18:31.152 --> 00:18:32.445 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Thanks.

00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:35.990 position:50% align:center
[RANGA grunts]

00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:47.544 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Hoo boy. That dude's bad news.

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:49.212 position:50% align:center
He's in a class all of his own.

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:53.550 position:50% align:center
So, this is one of the oldest
Demon Lords, Guy Crimson.

00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:04.060 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:05.520 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
That massive body...

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:07.522 position:50% align:center
And the ridiculous
amount of energy...

00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:10.358 position:50% align:center
Gotta be the giant
Demon Lord, Daggrull.

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:23.079 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Those fangs...

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:24.706 position:50% align:center
Is he a vampire?

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:27.208 position:50% align:center
Which would make him
Demon Lord Valentine.

00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:28.585 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:31.755 position:50% align:center

Huh? Wait a second...

00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:33.840 position:50% align:center
His attendant...

[RAPHAEL] Answer: Appraisal
suggests that the individual

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:38.845 position:50% align:center
in question may possess even
more magical energy than

00:19:38.928 --> 00:19:41.681 position:50% align:center
the one known as
Demon Lord Valentine.

00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:43.350 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I thought so.

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:46.019 position:50% align:center
That maid might be
the True Demon Lord here.

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:49.105 position:50% align:center
The one called Lurus
or Milis or whatever.

00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:52.275 position:50% align:center
I hope no one finds out about
my connection with Veldora.

00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:56.237 position:50% align:center
And if they do, I hope I don't
have to clean up the aftermath.

00:19:56.321 --> 00:19:58.615 position:50% align:center
[yawning]

00:19:58.698 --> 00:19:59.699 position:50% align:center
Hah?!

00:19:59.783 --> 00:20:01.785 position:50% align:center
[DEENO]
Hmm? Oh, hey!

00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:03.453 position:50% align:center
Wow, you're still
kinda puny, huh?

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:05.914 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS] Ah--
You trying to pick a fight?!

00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:08.124 position:50% align:center
You certainly showed up
with a lot of nerve, Deeno!

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:10.251 position:50% align:center
Don't be an idiot, why would I
wanna pick a fight that I know

00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:11.670 position:50% align:center
I'd win super easily?

00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:14.714 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS gasps] What?! You got
some kinda death wish?!

00:20:14.798 --> 00:20:17.217 position:50% align:center
I could take you down
with just one punch, buddy!

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.969 position:50% align:center
Please, you're even smaller
than the last time I saw you.

00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:20.970 position:50% align:center
Keep on wishing, though.

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:22.555 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS]
Hey, I can't help it!

00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:25.141 position:50% align:center
I'll have you know I was just
reborn not that long ago!

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:26.518 position:50% align:center
[DEENO] Hmm? Whoa,
what's a lonely loser like you

00:20:26.601 --> 00:20:27.852 position:50% align:center
doing with attendants?!

00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
Now I look lame
for coming alone.

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:31.147 position:50% align:center
[giggles]
Oh, you know.

00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:33.608 position:50% align:center
This is my way of getting back
at anyone who calls me "puny"

00:20:33.692 --> 00:20:35.735 position:50% align:center
or a "loser" or both
of those things!

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:37.112 position:50% align:center
Which would be you!

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:40.031 position:50% align:center
[DEENO] Hmm... Actually,
these two are kinda amazing,

00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:42.909 position:50% align:center
aren't they? Looking at them,
they're seriously intense.

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:45.328 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS] Yeah, tell me
something I don't know!

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:48.748 position:50% align:center
Now I've got some actual muscle
to back up all my tough talk!

00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:50.083 position:50% align:center
--Who's the loser now?
--[RIMURUI] Yep.

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:51.292 position:50% align:center
This checks out.

00:20:51.376 --> 00:20:53.211 position:50% align:center
[DEENO]
Meh, I'm over it.

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:56.548 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS] Hey! Come back here!
I'm not done bragging yet!

00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:59.217 position:50% align:center
[SHION gasps]
Huh...?

00:21:05.932 --> 00:21:07.183 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:09.352 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] That must be Frey,
the harpy Demon Lord

00:21:09.436 --> 00:21:11.688 position:50% align:center
the Beastketeers told me about.

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:16.276 position:50% align:center
Wow...! I've gotta admit,
the girl's got some major game!

00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:19.529 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure I just found
my new favorite Demon Lord.

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:20.989 position:50% align:center
Hey. Look.

00:21:21.072 --> 00:21:22.532 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
What's up, Shion?!

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:24.325 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Crap! She's gonna murder me!

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:26.327 position:50% align:center
The male attendant
behind Lady Frey.

00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:27.996 position:50% align:center
Don't you find him
a bit curious?

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:29.330 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Huh...?

00:21:30.248 --> 00:21:32.000 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] She's right.
He's definitely got

00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:34.377 position:50% align:center
a lot of magicules,
but not the insane amount

00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:36.713 position:50% align:center
that everyone else here does.

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:38.631 position:50% align:center
--I wonder if it could be--
--[RAPHAEL] Notice:

00:21:38.715 --> 00:21:40.425 position:50% align:center
Appraisal suggests
that the individual--

00:21:40.508 --> 00:21:42.635 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Nah! Even if that was Carrion,

00:21:42.719 --> 00:21:45.263 position:50% align:center
there's no way he'd make his
presence here so obvious.

00:21:45.347 --> 00:21:46.389 position:50% align:center
It can't be him.

00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:47.974 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Ugh! Hmph!

00:21:48.058 --> 00:21:49.351 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Is Raphael offended?

00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:50.602 position:50% align:center
[LEON]
So you are Rimuru?

00:21:50.685 --> 00:21:52.896 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
Uh!

00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:54.814 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Yeah, that's right.

00:21:56.274 --> 00:21:57.525 position:50% align:center
I get it.

00:21:57.609 --> 00:22:01.863 position:50% align:center
You must be Leon.
You want something from me?

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:03.490 position:50% align:center
I don't.

00:22:06.076 --> 00:22:07.952 position:50% align:center
[LEON]
You felt familiar.

00:22:08.036 --> 00:22:09.871 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it is your appearance.

00:22:09.954 --> 00:22:12.832 position:50% align:center
Yeah? You should know
that Shizu died.

00:22:12.916 --> 00:22:15.960 position:50% align:center
[LEON] I'm aware. It's only
natural that would happen.

00:22:16.044 --> 00:22:19.130 position:50% align:center
I expected it. Considering
she never accepted Ifrit,

00:22:19.214 --> 00:22:22.092 position:50% align:center
and she resisted
becoming a majin.

00:22:22.175 --> 00:22:25.095 position:50% align:center
Listen, I'm not saying this
because she asked me to,

00:22:25.178 --> 00:22:26.763 position:50% align:center
but let me slug you.

00:22:26.846 --> 00:22:29.474 position:50% align:center
I refuse. You must understand
that I gave Shizu

00:22:29.557 --> 00:22:32.852 position:50% align:center
the opportunity to choose
her own path in life.

00:22:32.936 --> 00:22:35.980 position:50% align:center
And what she decided was that
she wanted to live as a human.

00:22:36.064 --> 00:22:38.733 position:50% align:center
I gave Ifrit to her
as a parting gift.

00:22:38.817 --> 00:22:40.610 position:50% align:center
I see no reason
why I should be hit.

00:22:40.694 --> 00:22:42.070 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU growls]

00:22:42.153 --> 00:22:44.489 position:50% align:center
Although I do find myself
somewhat interested in you.

00:22:44.572 --> 00:22:46.366 position:50% align:center
I will invite you to my castle.

00:22:46.449 --> 00:22:48.785 position:50% align:center
If you have an issue
with me, see me there.

00:22:48.868 --> 00:22:50.620 position:50% align:center
But should you believe
this all to be a trap,

00:22:50.704 --> 00:22:53.123 position:50% align:center
you're free to refuse.

00:22:54.457 --> 00:22:55.834 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Fine by me.

00:22:55.917 --> 00:22:58.712 position:50% align:center
Send me the invitation and
I'll be there with bells on.

00:22:58.795 --> 00:23:00.130 position:50% align:center
Yes, all right.

00:23:00.213 --> 00:23:04.342 position:50% align:center
Of course... that's only
if you leave here alive,

00:23:04.426 --> 00:23:05.343 position:50% align:center
Rimuru.

00:23:05.427 --> 00:23:06.928 position:50% align:center
Huh...? Mm?!

00:23:08.638 --> 00:23:10.056 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Milim!

00:23:11.474 --> 00:23:15.020 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Oh, good.
She seems okay, at least.

00:23:15.103 --> 00:23:17.814 position:50% align:center
