[DIABLO]
Magnificent, Lord Rimuru.

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:37.495 position:50% align:center
What a truly beautiful
technique that was.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.582 position:50% align:center
Wow, yeah!
It was so captivating!

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:42.667 position:50% align:center
Hey, Rimuru! You sure
you don't want me to go

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:44.002 position:50% align:center
destroy some people?

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:46.296 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm positive. Plus,
like I've already told you

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.173 position:50% align:center
a few times now,
I wanna keep you a secret

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:49.799 position:50% align:center
until Walpurgis starts.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:52.844 position:50% align:center
But if you cause a commotion,
we'll be found out instantly.

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:53.928 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Hm...

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:55.597 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.683 position:50% align:center
How right you are!
It completely slipped my mind!

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:01.144 position:50% align:center
Then you'd better tighten
your grip! Am I clear?!

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.605 position:50% align:center
You'd better not do anything
unless we ask you to!

00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:06.149 position:50% align:center
--[laughs]
--Huh?!

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:09.861 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Meanwhile, Benimaru's
forces were headed to Eurazania.

00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:13.323 position:50% align:center
Once there, they'd face off
against Clayman's army.

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:17.118 position:50% align:center
In addition, Gazel's group
headed back to Dwargon.

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:20.914 position:50% align:center
Erald and his people
returned to Thalion.

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:24.751 position:50% align:center
And Youm's gang set off
to take over Falmuth.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:29.005 position:50% align:center
I will return promptly, sir.
Please do not worry.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.216 position:50% align:center
It's cool if you take your time.

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.927 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] I will return promptly,
sir. Please do not worry.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.428 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Come on.

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:37.639 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't rush taking
over a whole country, my dude.

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:41.393 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:44.020 position:50% align:center
It's about time
for us to get ready, too.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:46.106 position:50% align:center
Let's go crash Walpurgis.

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:18.823 position:50% align:center
So, no one is there?

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:20.241 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA]
Right.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.911 position:50% align:center
The Animal Kingdom of Eurazania
is completely deserted.

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:24.704 position:50% align:center
How can that be?

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:28.583 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN sighs]

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:32.420 position:50% align:center
I doubt that it matters. Go and
investigate the area thoroughly.

00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:33.797 position:50% align:center
They must be somewhere.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.924 position:50% align:center
--[YAMZA] Sir.
--[CLAYMAN] Tch.

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:37.467 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA]
There is one more thing.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.635 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
Hmm?

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:39.719 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA] One of the
soldiers heard something

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:41.680 position:50% align:center
rather interesting
from a peddler.

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:44.307 position:50% align:center
We came across them
on the road during our march.

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:45.850 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
Something interesting, you say?

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:47.268 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA]
Yes.

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:49.979 position:50% align:center
He told us that the Storm Dragon
Veldora has returned.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.189 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:53.942 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA roars]

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:55.735 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
Veldora, truly...

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.363 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA] He went on to inform us
that apparently Falmuth's forces

00:03:58.446 --> 00:04:01.116 position:50% align:center
were collateral damage
in Veldora's resurrection.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.493 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN] So, it was
the Storm Dragon's doing?

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:05.161 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA]
Yes. And since he has only just

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.831 position:50% align:center
been resurrected recently,
our sources suggest that

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.667 position:50% align:center
he is missing the
majority of his energy.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.377 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
I understand.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.422 position:50% align:center
So, the reason I lost contact
with Pirone and the marionettes

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:17.757 position:50% align:center
that I sent to infiltrate
Falmuth is because

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:21.011 position:50% align:center
they were caught up in the chaos
of Veldora's resurrection.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:23.555 position:50% align:center
I knew there was no way
a measly little slime

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:26.474 position:50% align:center
could defeat
Falmuth's entire army.

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:28.852 position:50% align:center
And with his power weakened,
defeating the Evil Dragon

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.854 position:50% align:center
will be an easy task.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:34.315 position:50% align:center
Perhaps I could even
make him one of my pawns.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:36.985 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
Yamza. Thank you for the report.

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:38.236 position:50% align:center
Keep up the good work.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.446 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA]
Right!

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:42.407 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
And to think, I nearly fell

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.326 position:50% align:center
for that slime's
ridiculous bluff.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.539 position:50% align:center
But unfortunately for him, the
truth is not so easily hidden.

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:52.334 position:50% align:center
You're merely borrowing
Veldora's authority.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50% align:center
I shall honor your boldness.
But prepare yourself.

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:58.923 position:50% align:center
I'm going to crush you
with my own hands!

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.717 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
Don't overestimate your control

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.761 position:50% align:center
over Demon Lord Milim.

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:05.263 position:50% align:center
I'd be careful around her.

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:06.681 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN grunts]

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:10.977 position:50% align:center
Hmph. No need to be such
a worrywart, Laplace.

00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:13.605 position:50% align:center
Since I shall certainly win.

00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:25.992 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Hmm...

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:27.160 position:50% align:center
Hmm?

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:38.505 position:50% align:center
[MILIM grunts]
Hello there, Frey!

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:41.091 position:50% align:center
It's absolutely gorgeous
outside today, huh?!

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:43.259 position:50% align:center
[giggles]
It's a little hot, though!

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.595 position:50% align:center
By which I mean, super hot!

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:46.805 position:50% align:center
Hello, Milim.

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:49.891 position:50% align:center
Heh. You certainly seem
to be in high spirits.

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:52.143 position:50% align:center
I take it that
something good happened?

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:55.063 position:50% align:center
[MILIM giggles]
That's right! Nice guess!

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:57.399 position:50% align:center
I got some new toys!

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:01.027 position:50% align:center
[MILIM chuckles]

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:02.529 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Oh, my goodness.

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:04.823 position:50% align:center
Where did you get such
treasures? They're lovely.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.366 position:50% align:center
[MILIM]
You really wanna know?

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.451 position:50% align:center
I mean, I would
like to tell you...

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.829 position:50% align:center
...but I dunno if I should.

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:12.956 position:50% align:center
Whatever should I do?

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:16.209 position:50% align:center
[FREY] Hmm. Still
such a troublesome girl.

00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:18.545 position:50% align:center
Come on, Milim,
I thought we were friends.

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.505 position:50% align:center
Surely, we can
share our secrets.

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:22.257 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's right!
And since we're friends,

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.050 position:50% align:center
then I can tell you,
so get ready,

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:27.012 position:50% align:center
because it's a great story!

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:28.346 position:50% align:center
There you have it!

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.890 position:50% align:center
My bestie for restie,
Rimuru, gave them to me!

00:06:30.974 --> 00:06:32.892 position:50% align:center
Oh. That's what you call
a friend who's the best

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:34.728 position:50% align:center
of all your friends,
so they're special.

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.813 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
I see. I'm glad for you.

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:38.064 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:40.358 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Oh, that reminds me, Milim.

00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:43.361 position:50% align:center
As your friend,
I also have a present for you.

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:44.904 position:50% align:center
I hope that you'll accept it.

00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:46.823 position:50% align:center
[MILIM]
Huh...?

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:50.660 position:50% align:center
Wow, a pendant, huh?
And it's just for me?

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:51.745 position:50% align:center
Hey...

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:54.456 position:50% align:center
[growls]
You can't have my knuckles!

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:57.000 position:50% align:center
[FREY chuckles]
No, that's quite alright, Milim.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:59.377 position:50% align:center
It's meant to be a symbol
of our friendship.

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:01.504 position:50% align:center
It's really nothing more
than a small token.

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:04.090 position:50% align:center
With that said, I'd be
very happy if you'd wear it.

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:07.969 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Oh, okay, if you insist, Frey!

00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:09.429 position:50% align:center
I'll put it on you.

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:11.639 position:50% align:center
[MILIM giggles]

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:19.105 position:50% align:center
Ah-- Hey, that tickles.

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:21.232 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Just hold still.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.943 position:50% align:center
[MILIM gasps]

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:39.125 position:50% align:center
[FREY sighs] Is this sufficient
for you, Clayman?

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:42.754 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN chuckles]
Yes, that will do wonderfully.

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:44.547 position:50% align:center
With that last step,
the forbidden magic,

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:46.841 position:50% align:center
Demon Marionette,
has been activated.

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:50.553 position:50% align:center
I'm excited. I now have
the strongest puppet of all.

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:52.055 position:50% align:center
[FREY grunts]

00:07:56.559 --> 00:08:00.355 position:50% align:center
[cackles] This is what you
get for underestimating me

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:02.357 position:50% align:center
and calling me
a rookie Demon Lord!

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.859 position:50% align:center
I wish you could see
just how pathetic you look!

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:06.444 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:07.529 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:10.031 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:13.535 position:50% align:center
[FREY] I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:16.329 position:50% align:center
Oh, please, this is not some
weak magic that will be undone

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:17.789 position:50% align:center
if she takes a bit of damage!

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:19.332 position:50% align:center
And surely, you're
fed up with her awful,

00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:21.668 position:50% align:center
condescending attitude,
as well, Frey. Right?

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:23.253 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, you would
have never agreed to be

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:26.047 position:50% align:center
a part of this scheme.
Tell me that I'm wrong.

00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:28.341 position:50% align:center
Fine, you're wrong.
If I'm being honest,

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:30.677 position:50% align:center
I was only fulfilling
the promise I made to you.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.597 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN] Heh! You truly are
such a shameless creature, Frey!

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:36.975 position:50% align:center
Look at her, she's nothing
more than a doll now!

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:40.186 position:50% align:center
There's no reason
to hold anything back! Hah!

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.355 position:50% align:center
[cackles]

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:45.150 position:50% align:center
[FREY] Yes, I can see
that from your actions.

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:46.693 position:50% align:center
Such an unsightly man.

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:49.654 position:50% align:center
Fair warning. You probably
haven't figured this out yet,

00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:52.574 position:50% align:center
but Milim does possess
a self-defense circuit.

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
She has a self-defense circuit?

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.412 position:50% align:center
I believe it's
called "Stampede."

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.873 position:50% align:center
Supposedly it causes her
to lose all control.

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:02.334 position:50% align:center
If you want to die that way,
it's your choice.

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:04.627 position:50% align:center
I, however, don't
want any part of it.

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.671 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
Hmm... Tch.

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:09.632 position:50% align:center
She is a terrible excuse
for a Demon Lord.

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:11.843 position:50% align:center
Well, no matter.
Using her as my doll

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:14.179 position:50% align:center
will give me a more
influential voice, anyway.

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:15.805 position:50% align:center
And you are rather complicit.

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:18.266 position:50% align:center
So, I will make absolutely
sure that you work your hardest

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.434 position:50% align:center
for me, Frey.

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:21.269 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Oh? Even though I believe

00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:22.645 position:50% align:center
you and I have equal footing.

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:23.980 position:50% align:center
How foolish!

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:26.316 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who came up
with this plan, remember?

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:29.027 position:50% align:center
While you are nothing more
than a pawn in my game.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:30.904 position:50% align:center
Here's an idea.

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:32.489 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you would
like to try fighting

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:34.741 position:50% align:center
against Milim, eh, Frey?

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:38.078 position:50% align:center
[FREY] Is that an attempt
to threaten me?

00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:40.955 position:50% align:center
[laughs] You're free to
glean whatever information

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:41.956 position:50% align:center
you want from it.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.166 position:50% align:center
But if you don't want to die,

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:45.794 position:50% align:center
then I'd suggest
not angering me.

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:49.381 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
Fine, I understand.

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:50.799 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
There's a good girl.

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:53.343 position:50% align:center
I'd advise you to think twice
before betraying me.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.929 position:50% align:center
You need only grant me
one tiny favor.

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:58.056 position:50% align:center
And then I'll be able to
guarantee you the title

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:00.016 position:50% align:center
of "Ruler of the Heavens."

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.687 position:50% align:center
A worthy title.
Right, Sky Queen Frey?

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:16.366 position:50% align:center
[FREY] The man is unable to see
the true nature of things.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:17.867 position:50% align:center
Along with the new moon,

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:20.662 position:50% align:center
Walpurgis Night
will soon be upon us.

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:23.748 position:50% align:center
Clayman...
I hope you're prepared.

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:26.626 position:50% align:center
It seems you're
not long for this world.

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:42.267 position:50% align:center
[MISERY]
Lord of Darkness,

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.687 position:50% align:center
Demon Lord Guy Crimson,
we bear a message.

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:49.649 position:50% align:center
[MISERY]
Demon Lord Leon Cromwell

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:51.901 position:50% align:center
wishes to speak with you.

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:35.195 position:50% align:center
It's been far too long.

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:36.696 position:50% align:center
I haven't seen
the Platinum Devil,

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.449 position:50% align:center
Demon Lord Leon
Cromwell, in ages.

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:42.494 position:50% align:center
Or would you prefer I call
you Platinum Saber instead?

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:44.662 position:50% align:center
Call me whatever you like.

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:46.498 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
How have you been fairing?

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:49.125 position:50% align:center
I appreciate you
responding to my summons.

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:51.044 position:50% align:center
You have my thanks.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.463 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:11:58.593 --> 00:11:59.803 position:50% align:center
--[GUY grunting]
--[LEON] Stop it!

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:02.180 position:50% align:center
I'm not into that,
I've told you before!

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:05.642 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
Wow, you're such a boring guy.

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:07.352 position:50% align:center
You know, if you prefer it,
I could always assume

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:10.230 position:50% align:center
a woman's appearance and
let you make love to me.

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:11.481 position:50% align:center
That's enough.

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:12.816 position:50% align:center
[GUY chuckles]
Mm...

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:15.276 position:50% align:center
All right. Let's talk elsewhere.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:12:19.531 --> 00:12:22.992 position:50% align:center
[LEON] So? Is there a particular
reason why you called me here?

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:24.494 position:50% align:center
[GUY] Naturally,
as you may already know,

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:28.164 position:50% align:center
the Demon Lords' banquet,
Walpurgis, is to be held soon.

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:31.042 position:50% align:center
Even if I have to force you,
I would like you to attend.

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:33.837 position:50% align:center
It's quite unusual for you
to try and coerce me.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.756 position:50% align:center
[GUY] Hmm. I want to make
sure you show up this time,

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.134 position:50% align:center
even if it means
I owe you a favor.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.930 position:50% align:center
And why is that?

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:47.100 position:50% align:center
Ahh... You're still as
cautious as ever, aren't you?

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:49.310 position:50% align:center
I suppose I don't
mind explaining it.

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:54.607 position:50% align:center
The person who proposed
Walpurgis this time was Clayman.

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:56.776 position:50% align:center
A small fry.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.070 position:50% align:center
But for some reason,
Milim's name was among those

00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:02.490 position:50% align:center
in agreement. Milim is one
of the oldest and strongest

00:13:02.574 --> 00:13:05.076 position:50% align:center
Demon Lords, alongside me.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.455 position:50% align:center
She wouldn't just do whatever
a whelp like Clayman wants.

00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:09.914 position:50% align:center
Which means...

00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:12.959 position:50% align:center
[LEON] Carrion's death
was suspicious, as well.

00:13:13.043 --> 00:13:15.795 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see you understand
what I'm hinting at here!

00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:17.797 position:50% align:center
Yes, Clayman's gone too far.

00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:20.425 position:50% align:center
In fact, he was harassing me in
order to avoid leaving behind

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:23.636 position:50% align:center
any concrete evidence.
I can't let it slide.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.723 position:50% align:center
Carrion's wellbeing aside,
Milim taking part in Walpurgis

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.183 position:50% align:center
is more than troubling.

00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:30.977 position:50% align:center
[GUY] Hmm. This might be
just another game to Milim,

00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:33.021 position:50% align:center
but disturbing the balance
between the Demon Lords

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:35.190 position:50% align:center
won't harbor any fun times.

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:38.068 position:50% align:center
It'll just create
more work for me.

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:41.404 position:50% align:center
Do you think it's possible that
Clayman is manipulating Milim?

00:13:41.488 --> 00:13:43.907 position:50% align:center
I doubt thinking about
Milim will do any good.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.034 position:50% align:center
Plus, clever people such
as I can't comprehend

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:47.660 position:50% align:center
the thoughts of silly fools.

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:50.330 position:50% align:center
It's one of my
very few weak points.

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:51.581 position:50% align:center
[LEON]
Hmm.

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.958 position:50% align:center
But if you're so
curious to find out...

00:13:55.085 --> 00:13:58.088 position:50% align:center
...I suppose... you'll just
have to go to the meeting.

00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:01.132 position:50% align:center
That's my intention.
I despise conspiracies,

00:14:01.216 --> 00:14:03.134 position:50% align:center
but it would seem that
I have no other choice.

00:14:03.218 --> 00:14:06.054 position:50% align:center
I see. I'm glad to hear that.

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:09.933 position:50% align:center
If you were reluctant,
I was going to offer to let you

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:12.477 position:50% align:center
hold me throughout the night
in order to convince you.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.478 position:50% align:center
No, thank you.

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:15.397 position:50% align:center
Aw, you're no fun.

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:19.192 position:50% align:center
Wow, you really are so boring.

00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:24.114 position:50% align:center
Unrelated, do you know anything
about this Rimuru fellow?

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:25.949 position:50% align:center
[LEON]
Only what I heard from Clayman.

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:28.451 position:50% align:center
He thinks Rimuru gives
Demon Lords a bad name.

00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:30.954 position:50% align:center
Me, personally? I feel like
as long as he proves himself

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:33.623 position:50% align:center
to be capable, then there's
not much of a problem.

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:36.418 position:50% align:center
You're saying he's qualified
to be a Demon Lord, then?

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:39.129 position:50% align:center
As for me, I think anyone that
Ramiris takes an interest in

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:41.715 position:50% align:center
has the potential to be
rather entertaining.

00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:43.299 position:50% align:center
Ramiris, you say?

00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:46.469 position:50% align:center
I don't like that fairy.
She's always poking fun at me.

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:48.972 position:50% align:center
I have often thought of
just strangling her.

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:50.932 position:50% align:center
[GUY laughs]

00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:54.185 position:50% align:center
Well, restrain yourself. Because
if do you go and kill Ramiris,

00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:55.562 position:50% align:center
then I'll end up
being your enemy.

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:58.732 position:50% align:center
Yes. I'm sure.
I wouldn't really do it.

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:00.567 position:50% align:center
Plus, I'm not about to
pick a fight with you

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:01.651 position:50% align:center
knowing I can't win.

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:03.361 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
Hmm? C'mon, that's not true.

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:05.030 position:50% align:center
If anything, I bet you
could probably kill me

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:07.115 position:50% align:center
at least once out of
a million tries.

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:09.242 position:50% align:center
How trivial. To be honest,

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:12.120 position:50% align:center
I would much rather discuss
fights that I know I can win.

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:13.830 position:50% align:center
Aw, don't be so modest.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:16.249 position:50% align:center
Even having the teensiest,
slightest chance of killing me

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:18.960 position:50% align:center
actually makes you
quite strong, Leon.

00:15:19.044 --> 00:15:21.296 position:50% align:center
Ugh. No need to tell me that.

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:24.215 position:50% align:center
It's just that you and Milim
are extraordinary.

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:28.219 position:50% align:center
Speaking of extraordinary,

00:15:28.303 --> 00:15:31.806 position:50% align:center
I hear that the Storm Dragon
Veldora has awakened.

00:15:33.224 --> 00:15:35.560 position:50% align:center
[VELZARD]
My, my. Now this is a rumor

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:38.563 position:50% align:center
that I'd actually be
interested in hearing.

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:41.191 position:50% align:center
Of course, I nearly forgot
that you were here.

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:44.486 position:50% align:center
If it isn't one of the only
four True Dragons in existence.

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:48.365 position:50% align:center
The White Ice Dragon Velzard,
and the Empress of Ice.

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:51.326 position:50% align:center
Oh, really? How could
you forget about little old me?

00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:53.453 position:50% align:center
You're as cold
as ever, Leon!

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:56.498 position:50% align:center
But... No matter what,
I'm still happy to see you.

00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:59.250 position:50% align:center
Are you? In that case,
I shall respond by saying that

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:01.336 position:50% align:center
you are a feast for
my eyes, as well.

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:05.256 position:50% align:center
Heh. I see the two of you hate
each other as much as ever.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.301 position:50% align:center
Say, Leon. Don't tell me that
you're jealous of my partner?

00:16:08.385 --> 00:16:09.552 position:50% align:center
Be serious.

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:11.096 position:50% align:center
[VELZARD chuckles]

00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:14.099 position:50% align:center
Back to your story. You were
saying that my younger brother,

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:16.351 position:50% align:center
Veldora, has finally awakened?

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:18.895 position:50% align:center
I stopped sensing him
about two years ago,

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:21.064 position:50% align:center
so I was all but convinced
that he had died.

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:23.024 position:50% align:center
Tell me, are you sure?

00:16:23.108 --> 00:16:24.484 position:50% align:center
There is no doubt.

00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:26.319 position:50% align:center
If the Evil Dragon
really is back, then why

00:16:26.403 --> 00:16:27.779 position:50% align:center
is he being so quiet?

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:29.572 position:50% align:center
I can't help but wonder
if he's grown too weak

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:31.366 position:50% align:center
to recover his own energy.

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:33.201 position:50% align:center
More to the point, I would
like to know who broke

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:34.452 position:50% align:center
my brother's seal.

00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:36.204 position:50% align:center
According to my spy's report,

00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:38.957 position:50% align:center
Clayman's scheme is what caused
Veldora's seal to break.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.792 position:50% align:center
Clayman's to blame, eh?

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:43.503 position:50% align:center
[LEON] He exerted his influence
over the Kingdom of Falmuth

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:46.673 position:50% align:center
and instigated them to destroy
a nation that Rimuru founded.

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:48.216 position:50% align:center
You're quite knowledgeable.

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:50.969 position:50% align:center
Naturally. After all,
unlike the two of you,

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:52.971 position:50% align:center
I was once a human being.

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:55.640 position:50% align:center
You see... that
battlefield was apparently

00:16:55.724 --> 00:16:57.517 position:50% align:center
where Veldora was sleeping.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.436 position:50% align:center
It would seem that when
he was on the brink of death,

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:01.855 position:50% align:center
being bathed in all the blood
of the battle just so happened

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:03.106 position:50% align:center
to awaken him.

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:04.816 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
Hmm...

00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:06.735 position:50% align:center
[LEON] Falmuth's army
became collateral damage

00:17:06.818 --> 00:17:08.945 position:50% align:center
of Veldora's revival,
and that allowed Rimuru

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:12.073 position:50% align:center
to escape disaster.
So, I heard.

00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:14.117 position:50% align:center
[VELZARD]
If that story is true,

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.787 position:50% align:center
does it mean Veldora's seal
was broken by pure coincidence?

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:20.749 position:50% align:center
[LEON] Perhaps.
Though I don't know for sure.

00:17:20.832 --> 00:17:22.417 position:50% align:center
[VELZARD]
I see...

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.961 position:50% align:center
There's also a small possibility
that the Hero's seal

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:26.504 position:50% align:center
was defective somehow.

00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:30.008 position:50% align:center
I agree it's possible. But I did
come up with another theory.

00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:31.968 position:50% align:center
And that would be?

00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:35.013 position:50% align:center
I don't know why he could
no longer be sensed,

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:37.974 position:50% align:center
but what if the Evil Dragon
was pulled into a hyperspace

00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:40.769 position:50% align:center
of someone's creation
along with his seal?

00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:42.187 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
Interesting!

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.688 position:50% align:center
That would mean that
there's someone capable

00:17:43.772 --> 00:17:45.273 position:50% align:center
of breaking the seal.

00:17:45.357 --> 00:17:47.317 position:50% align:center
What's more, whoever
this mysterious person is,

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.110 position:50% align:center
they would have to possess
a power that's equal to

00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:50.653 position:50% align:center
or greater than our own!

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:53.281 position:50% align:center
I'm merely saying
it's a possibility.

00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:54.908 position:50% align:center
And let me guess,
you think it was Rimuru

00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:57.577 position:50% align:center
that broke Veldora's seal, huh?

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.245 position:50% align:center
Indeed, I do.

00:17:59.329 --> 00:18:01.664 position:50% align:center
Not surprising.
Well, if that's true,

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:04.376 position:50% align:center
we definitely need
to figure out who he is.

00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:07.462 position:50% align:center
Clayman's violent acts,
Milim's strange behavior,

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:09.422 position:50% align:center
Rimuru's evolution
to Demon Lord,

00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:11.633 position:50% align:center
and now Veldora's return...

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:14.511 position:50% align:center
Imagine if these things
are connected.

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:16.471 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:18.723 position:50% align:center
Yes. If that's the case,
then this Walpurgis

00:18:18.807 --> 00:18:22.185 position:50% align:center
should turn out to be
very entertaining for us.

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:23.436 position:50% align:center
I wonder though...

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.814 position:50% align:center
Why is Veldora being so quiet?

00:18:25.897 --> 00:18:27.399 position:50% align:center
[VELZARD]
Hmm...

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.821 position:50% align:center
[VELZARD]
It would seem he is weak.

00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:34.864 position:50% align:center
His presence is so faint,
it's as if he's not

00:18:34.948 --> 00:18:36.825 position:50% align:center
even the same being.

00:18:36.908 --> 00:18:38.076 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
Huh...

00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:40.453 position:50% align:center
Still. It's strange he's
not going on a rampage.

00:18:40.537 --> 00:18:42.706 position:50% align:center
In the past, he acted as
though his rampages were

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:45.083 position:50% align:center
his very reason for living.

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:48.294 position:50% align:center
[LEON] Well. It makes
no difference to me.

00:18:48.378 --> 00:18:51.464 position:50% align:center
If you two want to make an ally
of Veldora, then feel free.

00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:53.258 position:50% align:center
I couldn't care less.

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:54.801 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
You're leaving already?

00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:56.344 position:50% align:center
[LEON] Yes, you've said all
that you wanted to say to me,

00:18:56.428 --> 00:18:57.929 position:50% align:center
haven't you?

00:18:58.013 --> 00:19:01.141 position:50% align:center
Hey, hold on a second, there's
no need to be in such a hurry.

00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:03.351 position:50% align:center
Do you think you'll be able
to accomplish your goal?

00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:06.187 position:50% align:center
Of summoning a specific target?

00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:08.523 position:50% align:center
[LEON] There has been
some interference.

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:10.108 position:50% align:center
It's delayed things.

00:19:10.191 --> 00:19:11.568 position:50% align:center
What interference?

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:13.611 position:50% align:center
Apparently, someone saved
the summoned children

00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:17.449 position:50% align:center
who were merely awaiting death,
before I could take them in.

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:18.783 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:20.827 position:50% align:center
Yes, and he seemed
rather furious to learn

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.495 position:50% align:center
that multiple nations are
summoning children

00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:25.540 position:50% align:center
from another world, so it's
highly possible he'll now try

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:28.418 position:50% align:center
to put pressure on each
of those nations to stop.

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:30.879 position:50% align:center
Which means this
experiment is over.

00:19:30.962 --> 00:19:33.131 position:50% align:center
Oh? Can't you just
get rid of the person

00:19:33.214 --> 00:19:36.676 position:50% align:center
who is interfering with it?
It should be easy enough.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.304 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
Except the person interfering...

00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:41.639 position:50% align:center
...is none other than
this Rimuru we discussed.

00:19:41.723 --> 00:19:43.725 position:50% align:center
[GUY gasps]
Seriously?!

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:45.935 position:50% align:center
Do you really think
that's a coincidence?

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:47.479 position:50% align:center
It is interesting.

00:19:47.562 --> 00:19:51.566 position:50% align:center
Which is why I wouldn't mind
seeing him for myself just once.

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:52.734 position:50% align:center
I see...

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:55.070 position:50% align:center
Now I'm even more
curious about this guy.

00:19:55.153 --> 00:19:57.238 position:50% align:center
And who knows? It's possible
that Milim is thinking

00:19:57.322 --> 00:19:59.199 position:50% align:center
the exact same thing that I am.

00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:03.203 position:50% align:center
She may be a moron, but she's
also surprisingly perceptive.

00:20:03.286 --> 00:20:07.665 position:50% align:center
Perhaps. Well, regardless,
Walpurgis will be hectic.

00:20:07.749 --> 00:20:10.251 position:50% align:center
[GUY chuckles]
Should be fun.

00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:11.670 position:50% align:center
By the way...

00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:13.463 position:50% align:center
Who is the mysterious
collaborator who's giving you

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:15.590 position:50% align:center
so much helpful information?

00:20:15.674 --> 00:20:19.219 position:50% align:center
[LEON] Someone from the empire,
but I don't know the details.

00:20:19.302 --> 00:20:21.429 position:50% align:center
He claimed to be
a merchant of some sort.

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:23.139 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
Can you trust him?

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:26.351 position:50% align:center
Of course not.
But I also don't need to.

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:28.603 position:50% align:center
I'm just using him
for my own gain.

00:20:28.687 --> 00:20:30.105 position:50% align:center
As long as that's
good enough for you,

00:20:30.188 --> 00:20:34.150 position:50% align:center
then I have no complaints.
Just try to be careful, okay?

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:36.778 position:50% align:center
If you die,
I'll make you regret it.

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:39.948 position:50% align:center
Heh. Wait, you're actually
worrying about me, Guy?

00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:41.491 position:50% align:center
How unusual.

00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:42.951 position:50% align:center
[LEON]
You can relax.

00:20:43.034 --> 00:20:45.578 position:50% align:center
I have no intention of dying
before I achieve my goal.

00:20:45.662 --> 00:20:47.247 position:50% align:center
That's reassuring.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.832 position:50% align:center
But tell me, Leon,
is this goal of yours

00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:51.209 position:50% align:center
really that important to you?

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:53.086 position:50% align:center
[LEON]
Yes.

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:54.754 position:50% align:center
[inhales]

00:20:54.838 --> 00:20:58.008 position:50% align:center
Because for me, it takes
priority over everything else

00:20:58.091 --> 00:20:59.676 position:50% align:center
in this world.

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:02.679 position:50% align:center
Ah. Well. I feel
kind of jealous.

00:21:02.762 --> 00:21:04.973 position:50% align:center
Please don't feed me
that nonsense.

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:06.016 position:50% align:center
[GUY chuckles]

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:07.934 position:50% align:center
[LEON]
But I will heed your warning.

00:21:08.018 --> 00:21:10.270 position:50% align:center
See you at Walpurgis.

00:21:10.353 --> 00:21:12.355 position:50% align:center
Bye.

00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:20.697 position:50% align:center
[GUY] Wow, he's so impatient.
That's typical Leon, though.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.282 position:50% align:center
And yet,

00:21:22.365 --> 00:21:24.993 position:50% align:center
for someone as cautious as him,
he's making himself vulnerable.

00:21:25.076 --> 00:21:27.162 position:50% align:center
Shall we look
into the matter more?

00:21:27.245 --> 00:21:29.205 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
Don't bother.

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:33.418 position:50% align:center
If we start meddling, it's only
going to make Leon angry.

00:21:33.501 --> 00:21:36.254 position:50% align:center
And I don't want to do anything
that'll make a friend resent me.

00:21:36.338 --> 00:21:37.672 position:50% align:center
If he happens
to ask me for help,

00:21:37.756 --> 00:21:40.258 position:50% align:center
then I'll do it when
the time presents itself.

00:21:40.342 --> 00:21:42.052 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:44.554 position:50% align:center
[GUY] Walpurgis is
shaping up to be fun.

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:45.972 position:50% align:center
Want to come with me?

00:21:46.056 --> 00:21:47.724 position:50% align:center
I'd like that.

00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:50.935 position:50% align:center
Wait. I'll actually pass.

00:21:51.019 --> 00:21:53.104 position:50% align:center
While I don't mind that
my brother will be there,

00:21:53.188 --> 00:21:56.191 position:50% align:center
I have no particular interest
in a bunch of Demon Lords.

00:21:56.274 --> 00:21:57.442 position:50% align:center
Whatever.

00:21:57.525 --> 00:21:59.194 position:50% align:center
Would you mind looking
after things here?

00:21:59.277 --> 00:22:01.738 position:50% align:center
[VELZARD]
Sure. Now, if you'll excuse me.

00:22:07.702 --> 00:22:09.162 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
Interesting.

00:22:09.245 --> 00:22:14.084 position:50% align:center
For the first time in centuries,
I can feel my heart racing.

00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:17.420 position:50% align:center
I have a feeling that some
big changes are coming...

00:22:20.382 --> 00:22:22.133 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
...to Walpurgis.

00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:57.520 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Next time, "The Signal
to Begin the Banquet."
