[laughing]

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:21.271 position:50% align:center
I am the Storm Dragon,
Veldora Tempest! Revived!

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:25.358 position:50% align:center
And those who defy me...
will be slaughtered!

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:29.070 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA laughing]

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:30.321 position:50% align:center
You for real?

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:32.615 position:50% align:center
Where did you hear
something so tropey?

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.325 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA laughs]

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:35.744 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Well, I was really bored,

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:37.203 position:50% align:center
so I analyzed your memories

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:39.372 position:50% align:center
and read all that "manga"
stuff you had in there!

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:42.292 position:50% align:center
Get this!

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:45.587 position:50% align:center
I can now play shogi
at the master level!

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.258 position:50% align:center
Wait, since I'm the Storm
Dragon, make it the Ryuo level!

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:51.801 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Gotcha.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:54.846 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to hear life in my
stomach was so awesome for ya.

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:55.597 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Hmph.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.931 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Huh?

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:58.558 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
I'm free after all this time,

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:00.560 position:50% align:center
but you're being very cold.

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:01.936 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.357 position:50% align:center
My freedom came more quickly
than I expected, though.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.694 position:50% align:center
I thank you, Rimuru Tempest!
Dearest BFF!

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:15.450 position:50% align:center
"BFF", really?
That's so outdated.

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:17.911 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:25.168 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot, did
you get an evolution gift, too?

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:26.836 position:50% align:center
Yes, indeed I did, my friend.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.047 position:50% align:center
As it would turn out, my
Unique Skill, "Inquirer,"

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.132 position:50% align:center
has evolved into
an Ultimate Skill!

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:33.093 position:50% align:center
It's called Faust, cool, right?

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:36.638 position:50% align:center
Behold! It's the ability to
reach the ultimate truth...

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:38.264 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Oh, that makes sense.

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:42.811 position:50% align:center
Especially considering my Great
Sage skill evolved into Raphael.

00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:44.688 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Yes. That is not all.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:46.981 position:50% align:center
Analyzing the remains
of Veldora has given you

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:50.568 position:50% align:center
a new ultimate skill, which
is also called "Veldora."

00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:51.820 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.405 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] In addition,
using the unique skill

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:55.073 position:50% align:center
"Unlimited Imprisonment"
as a basis

00:01:55.156 --> 00:01:57.158 position:50% align:center
to consolidate each
of your abilities,

00:01:57.242 --> 00:02:00.537 position:50% align:center
you have successfully acquired
the ultimate skill "Uriel."

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.124 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Wait, that means I have
four ultimate skills now?

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:05.875 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
It does mean that.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.377 position:50% align:center
[chuckles, yelps]

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.920 position:50% align:center
Great news, buddy!

00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:11.297 position:50% align:center
That also means you and I are
practically invincible now.

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:13.216 position:50% align:center
I say we relax and
just go with it!

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.509 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:20.598 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA laughing]

00:03:56.528 --> 00:04:00.740 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Hmm. My first
time outside in centuries.

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:03.159 position:50% align:center
Ah! The air tastes so sweet!

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:06.496 position:50% align:center
Listen, you think you can
tone down the enormous aura?

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.790 position:50% align:center
You're gonna scare the crap
out of everyone in town.

00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:10.917 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course. I'll try.

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:12.752 position:50% align:center
Suck it in or whatever.

00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:15.005 position:50% align:center
Hm. I see. That technique.

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.923 position:50% align:center
Technique?

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:20.385 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA yelling]

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:22.512 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Kind of reminds me
of a <i>shonen</i> manga.

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:30.437 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA yelling]

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.604 position:50% align:center
How's this?

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:33.398 position:50% align:center
Hey, not too shabby!

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:35.650 position:50% align:center
The death aura is
much smaller now.

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:39.362 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:41.656 position:50% align:center
You may thank the wisdom
found in the sacred texts

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.825 position:50% align:center
that contain all
knowledge of the world!

00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:47.078 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Man, I knew this was
something he saw in a manga.

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:52.167 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGERS murmuring]

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Hey, everyone. I'm back.

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:58.006 position:50% align:center
Oh, my!

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:00.383 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru! You're safe!
We were so concerned!

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:02.719 position:50% align:center
We suddenly sensed signs
that the Storm Dragon Veldora

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center
somehow returned to this land.

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:07.349 position:50% align:center
You did, but we'll get
to that in a moment.

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:10.185 position:50% align:center
First, I need to introduce
you to someone.

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.317 position:50% align:center
Everyone, this is Veldora.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.943 position:50% align:center
He's a bit shy
around new people,

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:21.071 position:50% align:center
but try and make friends, 'kay?

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:30.288 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Huh?

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:31.498 position:50% align:center
That's not true!

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:33.625 position:50% align:center
I'm not shy around new
people in the least.

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:35.126 position:50% align:center
It's just difficult
to make friends

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.713 position:50% align:center
when adventurers rarely
make it to you alive.

00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:40.632 position:50% align:center
[RIGURD, BENIMARU gasp]

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:42.425 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
It's Treyni!

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.303 position:50% align:center
Our guardian, Lord Veldora.

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:48.682 position:50% align:center
Allow me to congratulate you
on your triumphant return.

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:51.601 position:50% align:center
You must be a Dryad,
I remember your kind.

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:54.479 position:50% align:center
Uh, thanks for watching over
the Forest of Jura for me!

00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:56.481 position:50% align:center
[TREYNI]
I'm unworthy of your praise.

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:59.067 position:50% align:center
Such a small task is in no
way enough to repay you

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.152 position:50% align:center
for taking in me and my sisters.

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:02.821 position:50% align:center
Especially when we
were all separated

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50% align:center
from the Queen of Spirits.

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:05.824 position:50% align:center
It was nothing.

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:07.992 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:09.452 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:11.246 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:12.831 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Our Lord!

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:15.083 position:50% align:center
What?! He really is
the Storm Dragon?

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.293 position:50% align:center
Whoa, you gotta be kidding.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.379 position:50% align:center
Keep taking good care
of Rimuru for me.

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:21.798 position:50% align:center
Though I suppose you'll
be taking care of me, too.

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:24.884 position:50% align:center
Hey. Why would anyone
need to look out for you?

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:26.428 position:50% align:center
Um, sir?

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:28.763 position:50% align:center
[RIGURD]
Lord Veldora.

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:31.182 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, but what is your
relationship with Lord Rimuru?

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:32.809 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA laughs]

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:33.852 position:50% align:center
Shall I tell you?

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:36.062 position:50% align:center
[RIGURD]
Uh, yes! If you'd please.

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:38.606 position:50% align:center
Listen closely.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.816 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:45.071 position:50% align:center
This is my dear friend,
the other half of my soul.

00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:46.990 position:50% align:center
My bosom buddy!

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:49.534 position:50% align:center
My bosom buddy!
My bosom buddy!

00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:52.287 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Cool, I'm just gonna
die from embarrassment now.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.247 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGERS cheering]

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.248 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow!

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:56.666 position:50% align:center
So you're friends
with Lady Milim

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.460 position:50% align:center
and the Great Storm
Dragon as well?

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:00.337 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.798 position:50% align:center
See, I told you guys Lord
Rimuru was amazing!

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.468 position:50% align:center
Yeah, at this point,
nothing surprises me.

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:08.470 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] Just what you'd
expect from Master!

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:11.056 position:50% align:center
I have to agree. Heh.

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:14.351 position:50% align:center
By the way, why have you
taken a new form, my lord?

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:15.393 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Hm?

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:18.021 position:50% align:center
Rimuru had this body
prepared for me!

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.522 position:50% align:center
Well? Impressed?

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:21.483 position:50% align:center
[TREYNI]
Of course. You look wonderful!

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:23.651 position:50% align:center
I know, right? I'm awesome!

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:25.904 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:27.155 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU grumbles]

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:28.782 position:50% align:center
Everything makes more sense now,

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:30.867 position:50% align:center
especially considering
how you appeared to us

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.578 position:50% align:center
right after Lord Veldora's
aura initially vanished!

00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:35.163 position:50% align:center
I kept it on the DL.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:36.581 position:50% align:center
Originally, I thought
it would take

00:07:36.664 --> 00:07:38.750 position:50% align:center
well over a hundred
years to free Veldora,

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:40.335 position:50% align:center
so I didn't say anything

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:43.338 position:50% align:center
because I wasn't about to invite
in any extra trouble, you know?

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:44.673 position:50% align:center
Very wise.

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:46.257 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA laughing]

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:48.385 position:50% align:center

Lord Rimuru!

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:49.594 position:50% align:center
If you're ready,

00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:51.805 position:50% align:center
the preparations for
the feast are complete.

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:53.098 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:07.237 position:50% align:center
You guys, we've been through
some tough times lately.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.489 position:50% align:center
But for right now,
I say we eat, drink,

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:11.658 position:50% align:center
and forget about
all that other stuff!

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:14.119 position:50% align:center
Raise your glass.
Here's to life!

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:14.994 position:50% align:center

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:16.788 position:50% align:center

[RANGA howls]

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.219 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] That feast quickly
turned into a party

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:33.930 position:50% align:center
wild enough to put
fraternities to shame.

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:37.767 position:50% align:center
We celebrated life
and being alive together.

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:40.645 position:50% align:center
It's delicious!

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:42.105 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing]

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:45.692 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
I took a vicious attack!

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:47.402 position:50% align:center
But I used my Exo-evade!

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:51.114 position:50% align:center
And then a rolling attack from
behind with a forward punch!

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:56.202 position:50% align:center
[SHION humming]

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:59.873 position:50% align:center
Not much longer until it's done!

Why am I here?

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:11.384 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Because it's dangerous to go

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:13.219 position:50% align:center
into unknown battles alone.

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:15.263 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
You want me to die?

00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:18.308 position:50% align:center
Perhaps by some miracle
it might actually be good?

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:21.686 position:50% align:center
Not even a miracle can save
us from this fate, Benimaru.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.982 position:50% align:center
Thanks for waiting! Dig in.

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:30.487 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.073 position:50% align:center
[BOTH groan]

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:35.992 position:50% align:center
No need to hold back,
I made a huge pot!

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:37.285 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Shion.

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:39.662 position:50% align:center
You do know what the
word "cook" means, right?

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:43.667 position:50% align:center
Of course, I do, Lord Rimuru.
Look at it! It's amazing!

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.001 position:50% align:center
You just threw a whole
onion in here--

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:46.169 position:50% align:center
skin, roots, and everything!

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:47.295 position:50% align:center
The tomatoes still
have all their stems,

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:48.546 position:50% align:center
which you're supposed to remove,

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.881 position:50% align:center
and I don't even wanna
know what the deal is

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:51.633 position:50% align:center
with this bird foot thingy
that still looks alive!

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:52.967 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not,

00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:55.428 position:50% align:center
I have a little trouble with
chopping up produce.

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:57.847 position:50% align:center
I always take out the whole
building with the stems.

00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:00.684 position:50% align:center
Hold up. You destroy whole
buildings when you're chopping?

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
Yes.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.103 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU yelps]

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center
My Hercules' Edge is
fantastically sharp,

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:06.981 position:50% align:center
but I'm afraid it's a
bit on the long side.

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:08.316 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
You use that for cooking?!

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.526 position:50% align:center
Yep!

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:12.278 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:15.365 position:50% align:center
Since I was a child, I've always
thought nothing was impossible.

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:16.950 position:50% align:center
But it seems I was
overconfident.

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:18.952 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I don't even know
what he's trying to say.

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:20.453 position:50% align:center
Listen, Shion, a sword is not

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:22.580 position:50% align:center
an appropriate cooking
tool, understand?

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:26.042 position:50% align:center
You should use a smaller, much
less destructive knife to chop.

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.503 position:50% align:center
To use another blade
would be infidelity.

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:29.921 position:50% align:center
I shall not budge.

00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:31.589 position:50% align:center
Wow, you don't say.

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:33.758 position:50% align:center
I was gonna give you
a cooking knife as a gift,

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:35.010 position:50% align:center
but never mind now.

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:36.386 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
I was wrong! I made a mistake!

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:39.097 position:50% align:center
Even Hercules' Edge says
a little infidelity is fine!

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.473 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I see.

00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:42.767 position:50% align:center
Then, moving forward,
use a proper knife, got it?

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:44.436 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
Right!

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:45.979 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:48.857 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Not that a new knife

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.026 position:50% align:center
would really help our situation.

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:55.321 position:50% align:center
I doubt what we're about to eat
can even be classified as food.

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:58.491 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I'm a true Demon Lord now!

00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:01.703 position:50% align:center
So eating this probably
won't kill me, right?

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:16.551 position:50% align:center
[SHION chuckles]

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:18.303 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:20.180 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
It tastes good!

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:22.807 position:50% align:center
[giggling]

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:24.100 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
It looks like a witch's brew,

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:25.602 position:50% align:center
but tastes awesome!

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.145 position:50% align:center
How? What's the meaning of this?

00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:28.271 position:50% align:center
[SHION chuckles]

00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:29.481 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
If you must know,

00:11:29.564 --> 00:11:31.274 position:50% align:center
when we were receiving
gifts from Lord Rimuru,

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:33.902 position:50% align:center
I prayed that I'd be
better at cooking!

00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:37.697 position:50% align:center
So my gift is the unique
skill, "Master Chef"!

00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:40.367 position:50% align:center
"Master Chef"?

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.118 position:50% align:center
Truly?

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:43.620 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
Thanks to my new ability,

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.288 position:50% align:center
anything I cook
tastes fantastic

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:47.123 position:50% align:center
no matter how I make it.

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:48.583 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's cool.

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:51.086 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness!
Right, Benimaru?

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:53.171 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:56.466 position:50% align:center
I'm glad. Now we won't die.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:57.634 position:50% align:center
C'mon, let's eat!

00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.135 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.433 position:50% align:center
It may look terrible,
but it tastes amazing. Yum!

00:12:05.517 --> 00:12:06.476 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Yes, yes!

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.770 position:50% align:center
Even if it is a soup
of nightmares.

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:11.231 position:50% align:center
There's enough for seconds, too.

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:12.607 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU, BENIMARU]
That won't be necessary!

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:13.817 position:50% align:center
[SHION gasps]

00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:20.115 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] That night,
we learned an important lesson.

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:24.077 position:50% align:center
When it comes to cooking,
appearances totally matter.

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:32.043 position:50% align:center
Now then, I'm sure
you're already familiar,

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:33.712 position:50% align:center
but let me introduce him anyway.

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:37.549 position:50% align:center
This is Diablo, the one who
saved me from certain death.

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:40.218 position:50% align:center
He's new here, but he's really
strong and dependable,

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:43.054 position:50% align:center
so I plan to put him to work
as a second secretary.

00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:45.432 position:50% align:center
I'd like you guys
to treat him well.

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:47.517 position:50% align:center
Hello, it's a pleasure to
make your acquaintance,

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.685 position:50% align:center
and thank you in advance

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:51.354 position:50% align:center
for all of your guidance
and encouragement.

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:56.234 position:50% align:center
Teach him the ropes of
the job for me, Shion.

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:57.527 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir, as you wish.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.695 position:50% align:center
Oh, and Gabiru?

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:00.113 position:50% align:center
Sir!

00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:01.823 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] As of today,
you're in charge of development.

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:03.116 position:50% align:center
It's a temporary position,

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:05.702 position:50% align:center
but you'll be at the
top of the ranks.

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:07.662 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you.

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:10.457 position:50% align:center
I happily accept!

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.959 position:50% align:center
I shall devote myself
to this honorable task!

00:13:13.043 --> 00:13:15.712 position:50% align:center
Congratulations, Sir Gabiru!

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:19.215 position:50% align:center
Okay, then. I'd like to discuss
our plans for the future.

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:21.634 position:50% align:center
Youm and the Three Beastketeers,
this involves you guys,

00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:23.261 position:50% align:center
so please stick
around and listen.

00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:25.180 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing you've got an idea.

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:26.723 position:50% align:center
And hopefully it
has something to do

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:29.142 position:50% align:center
with the rescue of Lord Carrion.

00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:33.605 position:50% align:center
So I chose to become
a Demon Lord.

00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:34.230 position:50% align:center
We know.

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:35.648 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]

00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:37.400 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I said a Demon Lord.

00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:38.902 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:40.862 position:50% align:center
Like a real one.

00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:50.372 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Uhh...

00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:52.415 position:50% align:center
You're already a Demon Lord.

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:53.625 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Right, of course.

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:55.168 position:50% align:center
What I meant is that
I'm going to announce

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:57.253 position:50% align:center
to the whole world
that I'm a Demon Lord.

00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:58.463 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:00.006 position:50% align:center
By announcing this,
you mean to pick a fight

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.008 position:50% align:center
with the other
known Demon Lords.

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:03.718 position:50% align:center
Yes! Exactly right!

00:14:03.802 --> 00:14:06.763 position:50% align:center
But even more
specifically, one dude.

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:08.306 position:50% align:center
Lord Clayman.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:09.641 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:14.896 position:50% align:center
I get it.

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:17.691 position:50% align:center
You want to steal the Demon
Lord's throne yourself.

00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:18.775 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:20.026 position:50% align:center
Yep.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.153 position:50% align:center
The guy who orchestrated
the recent attack

00:14:22.237 --> 00:14:23.780 position:50% align:center
was Demon Lord Clayman.

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:27.409 position:50% align:center
And I have no intention of
letting him get away with it.

00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:30.704 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] After that,
I told everyone in the room

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:32.747 position:50% align:center
about my idea.

00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:34.207 position:50% align:center
It was a lengthy meeting.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.334 position:50% align:center
Between cleaning up
the Kingdom of Falmuth,

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:38.545 position:50% align:center
the need to keep the Western
Holy Church in check,

00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:40.380 position:50% align:center
and the rescue of the
Demon Lord Carrion

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:42.132 position:50% align:center
like we'd promised
the Animal Kingdom,

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:44.801 position:50% align:center
there was a lot to cover.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:45.635 position:50% align:center
Hey, Rigurd.

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:46.845 position:50% align:center
Sir!

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:48.555 position:50% align:center
Handle the talks with
the western nations.

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:51.224 position:50% align:center
Right! I'm at your
service, Lord Rimuru!

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:52.684 position:50% align:center
--[RIMURU] Benimaru.
--[BENIMARU] Sir!

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:54.644 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Gather the results
of everyone's evolutions.

00:14:54.728 --> 00:14:57.105 position:50% align:center
If we wanna make use of all
our forces against Clayman,

00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:59.357 position:50% align:center
then it's vital that we know
what our strengths are.

00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:01.443 position:50% align:center
Understood. Leave it to me.

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:02.444 position:50% align:center
--Shion.
--[SHION] Yes?

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:04.237 position:50% align:center
Interrogate the war prisoners.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.031 position:50% align:center
[SHION] Of course,
it would be my pleasure.

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:08.700 position:50% align:center
And try not to take
it too far, okay?

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:10.744 position:50% align:center
I'll show some restraint.

00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:13.580 position:50% align:center
I sure hope so.

00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:14.956 position:50% align:center
Youm and Mjurran.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.124 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:17.542 position:50% align:center
Go assist Shion.

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:19.210 position:50% align:center
Try and get them to
tell you what they know

00:15:19.294 --> 00:15:21.838 position:50% align:center
about the state of Falmuth,
as much as you can.

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:24.007 position:50% align:center
You can count on me, Master.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.968 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be my
kingdom, after all.

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:30.055 position:50% align:center
I also have a task for
the three Beastketeers,

00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
if you guys don't mind.

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:34.684 position:50% align:center
You are the leader of the Forest
of Jura, you need only ask us.

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:36.061 position:50% align:center
Just give us your orders.

00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:39.022 position:50% align:center
We're ready and willing
to do whatever you want.

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:40.815 position:50% align:center
Good.

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:42.067 position:50% align:center
For the time being,

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.194 position:50% align:center
rebuild your strength
for the upcoming battle.

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:45.820 position:50% align:center
--Right.
--'Kay!

00:15:45.904 --> 00:15:46.654 position:50% align:center
[FUZE]
Rimuru!

00:15:46.738 --> 00:15:47.906 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:49.282 position:50% align:center
I got here as fast as
I could in accordance

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:52.118 position:50% align:center
with the security pact
between Blumund and Tempest!

00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:53.328 position:50% align:center
Whoa, it's Fuze?

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:55.038 position:50% align:center
[FUZE] There were so
many dead in the city.

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:57.665 position:50% align:center
How could those Falmuth
bastards be so cruel?

00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:58.917 position:50% align:center
Uh. No.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.169 position:50% align:center
They're not dead,
they just drank too much.

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:04.464 position:50% align:center
It's not much, but I brought 50
fully-armed soldiers with me!

00:16:04.547 --> 00:16:07.801 position:50% align:center
And... they are prepared
for the worst.

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:10.095 position:50% align:center
Falmuth's main army doesn't
appear to have arrived yet,

00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:12.305 position:50% align:center
but fortunately, the king
of Blumund has also sworn

00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:13.807 position:50% align:center
to mobilize the
knights in his army!

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.017 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Whoa, Fuze, slow your roll, man.

00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:18.937 position:50% align:center
Oh, forgive me, did you already
have a plan or something?

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.314 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Um, yeah. A plan.

00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:22.816 position:50% align:center
Actually, about that...

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:25.652 position:50% align:center
Uh. Would you prefer
to keep it secret?

00:16:25.735 --> 00:16:27.404 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
That's not it, either.

00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:28.905 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU clears throat]

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:30.699 position:50% align:center
To be completely honest,

00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:33.243 position:50% align:center
I really do appreciate
your concern about us,

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:34.869 position:50% align:center
but the fight's kind of over.

00:16:34.953 --> 00:16:40.000 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sorry. What was that again?
How is it "kind of over"?

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:42.794 position:50% align:center
Uh, well, you know,
stuff happened.

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:45.005 position:50% align:center
And then I sorta, oh, I dunno,

00:16:45.088 --> 00:16:48.008 position:50% align:center
I guess the best way to describe
it would be I wiped them out.

00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:49.259 position:50% align:center
Meaning?

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.720 position:50% align:center
I destroyed the Kingdom
of Falmuth's whole army!

00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:53.930 position:50% align:center
Just completely
annihilated them!

00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:55.807 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU laughs]

00:17:07.152 --> 00:17:08.987 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:10.572 --> 00:17:12.032 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I get how you feel.

00:17:12.115 --> 00:17:15.827 position:50% align:center
Why don't you go relax in the
hot spring for a bit? 'Kay?

00:17:17.162 --> 00:17:18.997 position:50% align:center
[FUZE sighs]

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:22.125 position:50% align:center
Um. Show the soldiers to the inn
and tell them to rest up.

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:24.544 position:50% align:center
They came all this way,
so we should be hospitable.

00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:25.295 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA]
Right.

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:26.546 position:50% align:center
[YOUM]
C'mon, let's go.

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:29.132 position:50% align:center
No way, I've got more
questions for Rimuru!

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:31.259 position:50% align:center
Huh? There're more visitors.

00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:32.635 position:50% align:center
Besides us?

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:34.054 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:39.267 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Notice. Thirty
Pegasus knights approaching.

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:42.270 position:50% align:center
They are led by the king of
the Armed Nation of Dwargon.

00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:45.648 position:50% align:center
It is the individual by
the name of Gazel Dwargo.

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:50.612 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Hey, Raphael?

00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:52.030 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Yes?

00:17:52.113 --> 00:17:53.365 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] It's gonna be a hassle
to have you giving me

00:17:53.448 --> 00:17:55.450 position:50% align:center
every little detail on
someone when they show up,

00:17:55.533 --> 00:17:57.035 position:50% align:center
so keep it short, okay?

00:17:57.118 --> 00:17:58.578 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
What do you mean?

00:17:58.661 --> 00:17:59.621 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I dunno, just save it

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:02.540 position:50% align:center
for the hostile visitors
or whatever.

00:18:02.624 --> 00:18:03.958 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Understood.

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:12.592 position:50% align:center
Hello there, Rimuru. Well met.
I heard you're a Demon Lord now.

00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:15.136 position:50% align:center
You heard right. Things
have been kinda crazy.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.513 position:50% align:center
You've got great timing, though.

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:17.889 position:50% align:center
We were just having
a big meeting

00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:19.933 position:50% align:center
to discuss our future plans.

00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:21.351 position:50% align:center
How fortunate.

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:24.729 position:50% align:center
It's best that I also take
part in this meeting. Hm?

00:18:24.813 --> 00:18:26.106 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Huh?

00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:27.649 position:50% align:center
[grumbles]

00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:29.192 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:30.527 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
What?

00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:35.824 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
When did they get here?

00:18:35.907 --> 00:18:38.201 position:50% align:center
Universal Detect didn't
sense anything!

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:39.536 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Notice.

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:41.538 position:50% align:center
I detect no hostile
visitors within this group,

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:42.872 position:50% align:center
so I did not alert you.

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:44.207 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Oh, right.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.918 position:50% align:center
I suppose I did say it
was a hassle earlier.

00:18:47.002 --> 00:18:47.669 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Hmph.

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:49.212 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I'm sorry, okay?

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:52.007 position:50% align:center
Please give me clear reports
from now on, oh wise, Raphael!

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:53.091 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL sighs]

00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:55.051 position:50% align:center
Who are you people?
Show yourselves!

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:57.512 position:50% align:center
Well, well, those are some
bold words from a king

00:18:57.595 --> 00:19:00.140 position:50% align:center
who likes to hide underground.

00:19:00.223 --> 00:19:02.517 position:50% align:center
Though I would expect
nothing less from you.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.645 position:50% align:center
What is shocking is
that a coward like you

00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:08.314 position:50% align:center
would actually go
and back a Demon Lord.

00:19:08.398 --> 00:19:10.608 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes, if it isn't the
descendant of the Elves

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:13.528 position:50% align:center
who loves to live in
ridiculously high places.

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:17.282 position:50% align:center
What's wrong, was the air too
thin up in your divine city?

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:20.660 position:50% align:center
Though with that
body, it's unlikely.

00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:22.954 position:50% align:center
Why yes, you have
an excellent eye.

00:19:23.038 --> 00:19:25.123 position:50% align:center
It was made using
an artificial human.

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:27.667 position:50% align:center
A homunculus is perfect when
you're meeting a Demon Lord

00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:29.461 position:50% align:center
and wanna be careful.

00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:31.880 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Whoa, a homunculus so elaborate

00:19:31.963 --> 00:19:34.049 position:50% align:center
that I couldn't tell it
apart from a human.

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:36.718 position:50% align:center
I wonder if he'll teach
me how to make one.

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:38.470 position:50% align:center
Allow me, these people come from

00:19:38.553 --> 00:19:40.472 position:50% align:center
the Sorcerous
Dynasty of Thalion.

00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:42.349 position:50% align:center
I see you haven't
changed, Erald.

00:19:42.432 --> 00:19:44.351 position:50% align:center
Neither have you, Gazel.

00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:46.311 position:50% align:center
Pray tell, who's
your new friend?

00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:47.103 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Uh.

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:48.605 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, nice to meet you.

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:51.316 position:50% align:center
The name's Rimuru and I'm
the leader of this forest.

00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:52.400 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:54.110 position:50% align:center
[ELALUDE grunts]

00:19:55.278 --> 00:19:57.947 position:50% align:center
[ELALUDE]
Ah! That's enough!

00:19:58.031 --> 00:20:00.867 position:50% align:center
It's you! The seductive
Demon Lord!

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.994 position:50% align:center
How dare you take my daughter!

00:20:03.078 --> 00:20:04.579 position:50% align:center
Uh. Wha?

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:07.999 position:50% align:center
Well, I hope you've made
your peace, villain!

00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:11.002 position:50% align:center
Hear me, o flames that burn,
dance, and rampage!

00:20:11.086 --> 00:20:13.171 position:50% align:center
Gather, flicker, and pour
in a rain of violence...

00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:15.465 position:50% align:center
Whoa, that escalated quickly!

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:16.800 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Notice.

00:20:16.883 --> 00:20:18.218 position:50% align:center
This is an extremely
high-level explosion spell.

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:19.678 position:50% align:center
But why is it aimed at me?

00:20:19.761 --> 00:20:22.180 position:50% align:center
O flames, burn,
dance, and rampage!

00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:24.641 position:50% align:center
Gather, flicker, and pour
in a rain of violence!

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:27.977 position:50% align:center
Enough! You stupid idiot!

00:20:31.189 --> 00:20:34.401 position:50% align:center
[ELALUDE groaning]

00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:37.445 position:50% align:center
Dad, you can't just go
around exploding things!

00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:39.656 position:50% align:center
Oh, Eren! Thank goodness
you're all right, sweetie.

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:40.865 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course I'm all right.

00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:43.076 position:50% align:center
I'm here of my own
free will, you dummy!

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:46.996 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's wonderful to hear.
I do apologize.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.748 position:50% align:center
I received a report
saying my daughter

00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:50.250 position:50% align:center
had been taken by a Demon Lord,

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:52.627 position:50% align:center
so needless to say,
I panicked a little.

00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:54.462 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Dude almost nuked us.

00:20:54.546 --> 00:20:57.048 position:50% align:center
I see you're still an
overprotective father.

00:20:57.132 --> 00:20:59.175 position:50% align:center
[ELALUDE]
I am not overprotective.

00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:01.428 position:50% align:center
I'm merely looking
out for my daughter.

00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:02.929 position:50% align:center
My sweet widdle pwincess!

00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:05.390 position:50% align:center
Do you even hear yourself?

00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:07.767 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, that's a father
for you, I suppose.

00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:09.019 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Rimuru.

00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:11.104 position:50% align:center
This extremely stupid
man is Erald Grimwald,

00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:13.231 position:50% align:center
the archduke of the
Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion,

00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:14.691 position:50% align:center
and my father.

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:16.276 position:50% align:center
[ELALUDE clears throat]

00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:18.528 position:50% align:center
Leader of the Great Forest of
Jura and ruler of the monsters,

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:19.779 position:50% align:center
it's nice to meet you.

00:21:19.863 --> 00:21:21.239 position:50% align:center
My daughter has
aptly explained it,

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:22.741 position:50% align:center
but allow me to say it again.

00:21:22.824 --> 00:21:25.076 position:50% align:center
I'm the archduke from the
esteemed Sorcerous Dynasty,

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.411 position:50% align:center
Erald Grimwald.

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:28.413 position:50% align:center
By all means, feel free
to call me Erald, though.

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:30.206 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Sure thing.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.667 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Well, Eren is nobility.

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:35.628 position:50% align:center
Guess I should've expected
something like this.

00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:37.297 position:50% align:center
So did you only come
here 'cause you thought

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.049 position:50% align:center
I bamboozled your daughter?

00:21:39.132 --> 00:21:40.467 position:50% align:center
[EREN gasps]

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.470 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Well, there may
have been anothers reason.

00:21:43.553 --> 00:21:45.513 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I figured.

00:21:45.597 --> 00:21:48.808 position:50% align:center
I wanted to see what could keep
Eren away from me for so long.

00:21:48.892 --> 00:21:50.602 position:50% align:center
She and her companions
seem to have become

00:21:50.685 --> 00:21:52.937 position:50% align:center
