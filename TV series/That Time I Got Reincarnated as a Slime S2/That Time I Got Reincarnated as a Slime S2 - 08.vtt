00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:23.231 position:50% align:center
[MYULAN] Demon Lord Clayman
lives up to his alias,

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:25.066 position:50% align:center
"Marionette Master,"
by controlling

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.610 position:50% align:center
his subordinates' actions.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:30.405 position:50% align:center
And unfortunately,
I am one of them.

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:33.074 position:50% align:center
The task Lord Clayman gave me
was to investigate your country

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:36.202 position:50% align:center
as a spy. So I decided
to use Youm as a way

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:38.288 position:50% align:center
to infiltrate the city.

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:40.832 position:50% align:center
Then he contacted me
again and ordered me to use

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:43.501 position:50% align:center
the "Anti-Magic Area"
spell right away.

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.670 position:50% align:center
[YOUM sighs]

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:47.088 position:50% align:center
[MYULAN] Lord Clayman
took my heart from me

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:48.673 position:50% align:center
with his secret skill.

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:50.842 position:50% align:center
It's known as
"Marionette Heart."

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:53.261 position:50% align:center
Ever since then, my only
means of survival has been

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:56.097 position:50% align:center
to obey his every command.

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:58.808 position:50% align:center
I get it. He literally
holds the key

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.478 position:50% align:center
that determines whether
you live or die.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:05.607 position:50% align:center
The real question is, what made
Clayman want to mess with me?

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.526 position:50% align:center
Not long ago, he said
something ominous.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.820 position:50% align:center
"Things are getting
rather interesting.

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:12.739 position:50% align:center
A grand war is
going to break out,

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:14.366 position:50% align:center
though unexpected
events have led

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:16.242 position:50% align:center
to some surprising
developments."

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:18.703 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:20.288 position:50% align:center
[MYULAN] At first,
I thought he was referring to

00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:23.208 position:50% align:center
the Demon Lords
Milim and Carrion.

00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:25.418 position:50% align:center
But I suspect what he actually
meant was that he's starting

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:30.465 position:50% align:center
a war between Tempest--
and the Kingdom of Falmuth.

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:33.343 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Clayman... Seems like
he controls everything

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:36.513 position:50% align:center
through his pawns to avoid
getting his own hands dirty.

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.932 position:50% align:center
He's gonna be trouble.

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:41.643 position:50% align:center
She appears to be
some kind of wizard.

00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:45.313 position:50% align:center
But in the Anti-Magic Area,
she's just an ordinary human.

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:46.773 position:50% align:center
A sacrifice.

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:49.567 position:50% align:center
Master! Please forgive Myulan!

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:51.111 position:50% align:center
[GRUCIUS]
I'm begging you, too!

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:54.698 position:50% align:center
It's not her fault, she couldn't
defy the Demon Lord Clayman!

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.574 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU sighs]

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:59.035 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.497 position:50% align:center
I'll put Myulan's punishment
on hold for the time being.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.417 position:50% align:center
She'll be confined to the
reception hall until then.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.294 position:50% align:center
Understood.
I will assign her some guards.

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:09.337 position:50% align:center
[YOUM]
Come on...

00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:10.839 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I've got no choice, Youm.

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:12.173 position:50% align:center
I can't think straight
with everything

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:13.800 position:50% align:center
that's going on right now.

00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:14.968 position:50% align:center
And if you're really
that worried,

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:16.761 position:50% align:center
you're welcome to stay with her.

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:18.179 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:25.353 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:02:25.437 --> 00:02:27.105 position:50% align:center
--Is that the whole report?
--[BENIMARU] Yes.

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:29.107 position:50% align:center
Then I'd like to
go visit the injured.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.234 position:50% align:center
Take me to them.

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.153 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:11.084 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:14.838 position:50% align:center
Shuna. How's he doing?

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.340 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA]
Lord Rimuru!

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:19.050 position:50% align:center
The potions aren't working.

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:22.053 position:50% align:center
Since their wounds were caused
by skills of a spatial nature,

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:24.139 position:50% align:center
my usual treatments aren't
as effective as they would be

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:26.182 position:50% align:center
under normal circumstances.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:28.643 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I see...

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:30.812 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU]
Hmm? Lord Rimuru.

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:33.523 position:50% align:center
We'll be fine,
please don't worry.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:36.067 position:50% align:center
My pupil may be as
foolish as they come,

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:37.986 position:50% align:center
but neither of us are
so weak that we'd die

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.821 position:50% align:center
from such trivial wounds.

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:42.699 position:50% align:center
Heh! Yeah, I definitely
know that.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:45.577 position:50% align:center
Here. Let me take
a look at your injury.

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:48.455 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Great Sage.

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:51.124 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE] Effect of
spatial technique confirmed.

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:53.710 position:50% align:center
Would you like to devour
this effect using Gluttony?

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.462 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Make it so!

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:01.676 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Whoa!

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.636 position:50% align:center
Am... I actually alive?!

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.264 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU]
Hmm. Yes, thanks to Lord Rimuru.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:07.515 position:50% align:center
I'm glad.

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.351 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru!
Welcome back, sir!

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:11.102 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hey, easy.

00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:12.354 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU laughs]

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:14.898 position:50% align:center
Wow, and you even
saved the old man?

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.817 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU growls] Do you want
the "old man" to hurt you?

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:18.943 position:50% align:center
[GOBTA]
I meant Master!

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:21.029 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy
you're not dead, sir!

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:22.530 position:50% align:center
[laughter]

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:23.615 position:50% align:center
[GOBTA]
Wait!

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:26.284 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. Why haven't
I seen Shion?

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:29.579 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me she ran off
to get revenge all by herself.

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:31.915 position:50% align:center
Knowing her,
I wouldn't be surprised.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:33.291 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:34.959 position:50% align:center
Hmm?

00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:38.463 position:50% align:center
Uh... Well. The thing is...

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:52.644 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Benimaru wouldn't explain.

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:55.397 position:50% align:center
He just left and
asked me to follow him.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.857 position:50% align:center
Then he started
walking toward the plaza,

00:05:57.941 --> 00:06:01.111 position:50% align:center
where the deceased
monsters were laid to rest.

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.415 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:15.208 position:50% align:center
[GOBTA]
Gobzo...?

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:16.793 position:50% align:center
Gobzo!

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:20.588 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:27.679 position:50% align:center
[wails, sobs]

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.727 position:50% align:center
[GOBZO sobbing]

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.523 position:50% align:center
Shion... tried to protect
a child from our attackers.

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:43.695 position:50% align:center
Weakened by the barrier,
she couldn't get out of the way.

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:47.949 position:50% align:center
And Gobzo was slain
when he tried to protect me.

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:51.244 position:50% align:center
The people who attacked
took such joy in it.

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:02.172 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru!

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:09.637 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Sorry.

00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:11.890 position:50% align:center
But I need to be
alone for a while.

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:14.684 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU, RIGURD grunt]

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:16.478 position:50% align:center
Very well.

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:20.357 position:50% align:center
[GOBTA sobbing]

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.484 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU sighs]
Come on.

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:44.464 position:50% align:center
Please call me at any time.
I'll be here at once.

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:52.430 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE]
Notice.

00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:54.683 position:50% align:center
A monster in a weakened
state feels great pressure

00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:56.685 position:50% align:center
from a powerful aura.

00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:58.728 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Yeah.

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.941 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU grunts]

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:05.694 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] That's right, I gave
the magic-suppressing mask

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:07.112 position:50% align:center
to Chloe.

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:08.780 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Is the Analysis done?

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:10.448 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE]
It is complete.

00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:11.950 position:50% align:center
Replicate the item?

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.993 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Yes, please.

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:23.211 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Why? Why did this happen?

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:25.422 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE]
Notice. Cannot calculate.

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:27.632 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] What should
I have done differently?

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:30.135 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE]
Notice. Cannot comprehend.

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:33.054 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Was it a mistake
to get involved with humans?

00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:35.598 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE]
Notice. Cannot answer.

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:39.477 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Tell me. Was I in the wrong?

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:41.730 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE]
Notice. Cannot calculate.

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:44.733 position:50% align:center
Cannot comprehend.
Cannot answer.

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:49.070 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] All these intense
emotions are like a raging beast

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:52.824 position:50% align:center
in my head, and yet
I also feel so calm.

00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:55.827 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I can't even shed a single tear.

00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:59.330 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Oh... I get it.

00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:04.169 position:50% align:center
I've become a monster.
In body and in heart.

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:14.262 position:50% align:center
[EREN grunts]

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:20.810 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE] Notice. Search
results are unavailable.

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:22.896 position:50% align:center
Could not locate any
magic with the ability

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:25.148 position:50% align:center
to fully revive the dead.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.858 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Too bad.

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:30.695 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
What about the barrier?

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:33.114 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE] Notice.
I've completed the analysis

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:35.867 position:50% align:center
of the two-layer barrier
surrounding the city.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.745 position:50% align:center
Removal of a multi-layer
barrier is difficult,

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:42.540 position:50% align:center
but the great magic, 
Anti-Magic Area, can be undone.

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:43.708 position:50% align:center
Undo this magic?

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:45.710 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
No, not yet.

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:48.713 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I wanted to get rid
of the multi-layer barrier

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:51.049 position:50% align:center
that's weakening everyone,

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:53.718 position:50% align:center
but I guess it won't
go down that easily.

00:09:57.389 --> 00:10:01.810 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I suppose... I can't
stay here like this forever.

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:06.022 position:50% align:center
In time, their bodies will
decay, return to magicules,

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:08.733 position:50% align:center
and finally disappear.

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:20.328 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] If nothing else, they
can rest peacefully within me.

00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:24.708 position:50% align:center
[EREN]
Rimuru!

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.837 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Thank you for coming.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.588 position:50% align:center
Give me a moment.

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:33.591 position:50% align:center
I need to lay them
all to rest first.

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:35.176 position:50% align:center
Wait, listen to me!

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.220 position:50% align:center
The odds are
pretty slim, in fact,

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:39.347 position:50% align:center
they might be basically zero,

00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:41.224 position:50% align:center
but I know a fairy tale
specifically about

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:42.767 position:50% align:center
bringing the dead back to life!

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:43.893 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:45.270 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:48.023 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] A fairy tale?
What's that supposed to mean?

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:50.775 position:50% align:center
Why are you
telling me this, Eren?

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:54.195 position:50% align:center
Stop it. You'll get my hopes up.

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:57.282 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] You'll make me think
that there's still something

00:10:57.365 --> 00:10:59.492 position:50% align:center
I can do for them.

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:01.119 position:50% align:center
Is it for them?

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:03.580 position:50% align:center
No, it's not.

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:08.335 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I just don't want to lose them.

00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:11.921 position:50% align:center
Look, you might think this
is nothing but a fairy tale,

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:14.299 position:50% align:center
but I promise you
it's based on facts!

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:16.176 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU laughs]

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:17.719 position:50% align:center
Uh, Rimuru?

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:19.721 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Yeah, sorry.

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:22.098 position:50% align:center
I was just so happy.

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:26.394 position:50% align:center
Reviving the dead, huh?
It sounds like a dream.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.232 position:50% align:center
If the chance isn't zero,
then I'm in.

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:34.027 position:50% align:center
Tell me the story, Eren.

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:41.242 position:50% align:center
[SOUEI] The Western Holy
Church's forces are camped

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:43.370 position:50% align:center
around the city on all sides.

00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:46.748 position:50% align:center
Each camp is protecting what
appears to be a magic device.

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:48.249 position:50% align:center
I believe these devices
may be the source

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:51.169 position:50% align:center
of the weakening barrier.

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:52.671 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Can they be disabled?

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:54.839 position:50% align:center
[SOUEI] Perhaps one,
with a sneak attack.

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:57.217 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Okay. Continue
to keep an eye on things,

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.761 position:50% align:center
but don't push
your luck too far.

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:01.012 position:50% align:center
[SOUEI]
Right.

00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:02.597 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that, Eren.

00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:06.351 position:50% align:center
Now, then. Tell me this fairy
tale about reviving the dead.

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:08.019 position:50% align:center
[EREN]
Mm.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:12.691 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:13.983 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uh...

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:17.195 position:50% align:center
It's fine. Here goes.

00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:20.990 position:50% align:center
This story comes from the
Sorcerous Dynasty Sarion.

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:27.706 position:50% align:center
[EREN] It's the tale of
a girl and her pet dragon.

00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:30.458 position:50% align:center
The girl was the daughter
of a human and a dragon,

00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:33.878 position:50% align:center
and she was raised as
the Dragon Princess.

00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:36.172 position:50% align:center
One day, her father, a dragon,

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:38.842 position:50% align:center
made a double of himself
in the form of a baby,

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:42.095 position:50% align:center
so the girl would have a friend.

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:43.555 position:50% align:center
But then,

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:46.474 position:50% align:center
in an effort to gain control
over the Dragon Princess,

00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:50.353 position:50% align:center
a king killed her beloved pet.

00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:55.900 position:50% align:center
The girl went mad
with pain, grief, and rage.

00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:58.820 position:50% align:center
With the power she had
inherited from her father,

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:02.741 position:50% align:center
she destroyed the king
along with his entire nation,

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:05.618 position:50% align:center
including tens of
thousands of people.

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:08.580 position:50% align:center
Then the girl transformed
into a Demon Lord.

00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:11.541 position:50% align:center
And when she did, the
baby dragon miraculously

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:15.337 position:50% align:center
came back to life.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:19.382 position:50% align:center
But... Since the creature had
lost its soul when it died,

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:22.844 position:50% align:center
it came back as an evil monster
with no will of its own,

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:25.221 position:50% align:center
and destroyed
everything in its path.

00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:28.308 position:50% align:center
It was known as
the Chaos Dragon.

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:31.061 position:50% align:center
Though it pained her greatly,
the girl sealed away

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:34.564 position:50% align:center
her once-beloved companion.

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:37.359 position:50% align:center
This was the very first task
she accomplished

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:39.861 position:50% align:center
upon becoming a Demon Lord.

00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:43.782 position:50% align:center
And that's the ending
of the fairy tale.

00:13:44.908 --> 00:13:46.659 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU sighs]

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:50.372 position:50% align:center
She destroyed an entire nation
to become a Demon Lord.

00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:52.749 position:50% align:center
And when she did,
the dragon she was bonded with

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.709 position:50% align:center
came back to life.

00:13:54.793 --> 00:13:57.671 position:50% align:center
It's true that monsters evolve
for unknown reasons.

00:13:57.754 --> 00:14:01.966 position:50% align:center
All I did was name them,
and they went crazy.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.510 position:50% align:center
Still though...

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:06.137 position:50% align:center
There's no point if they return
without a will of their own.

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:09.307 position:50% align:center
That's certainly true,
but there's a barrier

00:14:09.391 --> 00:14:11.643 position:50% align:center
right now, right?

00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:15.021 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps] Wait. So you're
saying the barrier could be

00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:18.149 position:50% align:center
keeping their souls
from escaping?

00:14:18.233 --> 00:14:20.527 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE] Notice. Normally,
the souls of the deceased

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.821 position:50% align:center
scatter before
eventually disappearing,

00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:24.739 position:50% align:center
but it is possible that
the double-layer barrier

00:14:24.823 --> 00:14:26.866 position:50% align:center
is preventing this.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:30.120 position:50% align:center
The probability of it
is 3.14 percent.

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:32.414 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
As low as pi.

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:34.666 position:50% align:center
No, it's the opposite.

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:39.004 position:50% align:center
The chance that I could
revive them is a whole 3%.

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:41.673 position:50% align:center
If I can become a Demon Lord...

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:46.136 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Eren. Thanks
for telling me this.

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:47.137 position:50% align:center
[EREN]
Mm.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.888 position:50% align:center
Is it really okay, though?

00:14:48.972 --> 00:14:52.100 position:50% align:center
You did basically tell me
to become a Demon Lord.

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:53.309 position:50% align:center
You know that, right?

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:55.812 position:50% align:center
[EREN]
Mm. Honestly,

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:59.357 position:50% align:center
I should tell you my real name,
which is Eryune Grimwald.

00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:01.317 position:50% align:center
My blood connects me
to the royal family of

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:03.236 position:50% align:center
the Sorcerous Dynasty Sarion.

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:04.779 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
You're a princess?

00:15:04.863 --> 00:15:06.114 position:50% align:center
[GIDO sighs]

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:07.866 position:50% align:center
The thing is, we left
our country along

00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:10.702 position:50% align:center
with Princess Eren.
We're her official bodyguards.

00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:12.203 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
That's a scary thought.

00:15:12.287 --> 00:15:14.080 position:50% align:center
Sorry we didn't tell you.

00:15:14.164 --> 00:15:16.082 position:50% align:center
I've just always
loved adventuring.

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:18.460 position:50% align:center
That's why I decided to leave.

00:15:18.543 --> 00:15:20.920 position:50% align:center
Still. That's not
a well-known story.

00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:24.007 position:50% align:center
Only a few people in
Sarion know about it.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.176 position:50% align:center
If you do become
a Demon Lord, they might realize

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:28.136 position:50% align:center
that I had something
to do with it.

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:29.220 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:29.304 --> 00:15:30.638 position:50% align:center
I don't mind, though.

00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:33.308 position:50% align:center
I want to help save
the people of this city, too.

00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:35.143 position:50% align:center
And I definitely don't
condone the bad things that

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:38.396 position:50% align:center
the Kingdom of Falmuth and the
Western Holy Church are doing!

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.065 position:50% align:center
[KAVAL] If that's how
you truly feel, Princess,

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:42.734 position:50% align:center
then we have no objections
as your bodyguards.

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:44.444 position:50% align:center
[GIDO]
We're on board.

00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:46.946 position:50% align:center
I envy you.
You've got great friends.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.947 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:50.325 position:50% align:center
[EREN]
Uh... Hmm.

00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:53.661 position:50% align:center
If there's anything we can
do to help, just let us know!

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:55.538 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you've always
done a lot for us.

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:58.500 position:50% align:center
It only makes sense that
we should return the favor.

00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:00.377 position:50% align:center
Thanks, guys.

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:08.593 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] To stop the souls
of Shion and the others

00:16:08.677 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50% align:center
from dispersing, I erected
a third barrier around the city.

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:15.183 position:50% align:center
Just to be on the safe side.

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:20.355 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU grunts]
A Demon Lord...

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:22.941 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE] Notice. The
individual named Rimuru Tempest

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:25.443 position:50% align:center
has already acquired
the Demon Lord seed.

00:16:25.527 --> 00:16:27.112 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I've acquired a seed?

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:28.488 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:30.657 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE] Answer.
Existence of the Demon Lord seed

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.326 position:50% align:center
is an indicator of whether
one has the magicules, skills,

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:34.953 position:50% align:center
and other requirements
to awaken as

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:36.579 position:50% align:center
a True Demon Lord.

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:39.541 position:50% align:center
[You acquired the seed when you
devoured the Orc Disaster.

00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:41.626 position:50% align:center
If you meet the conditions,
you can potentially evolve

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.878 position:50% align:center
into a True Demon Lord.

00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:45.046 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
For real?!

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.382 position:50% align:center
Okay, so what
are the conditions?

00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:49.342 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE] The fairy tale
suggests that nourishment

00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:52.637 position:50% align:center
is needed in order
to make the seed sprout.

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:55.140 position:50% align:center
That nourishment comes
from the souls of humans.

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:58.059 position:50% align:center
The minimum requirement
is 10,000.

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:02.814 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I see.

00:17:04.149 --> 00:17:05.066 position:50% align:center
[SOUEI]
Lord Rimuru.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.276 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
What's up?

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:07.569 position:50% align:center
[SOUEI] I have a report
from one of our men

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:09.362 position:50% align:center
some distance from here.

00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:11.990 position:50% align:center
The combined forces of Falmuth
and the Western Holy Church

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:14.451 position:50% align:center
are marching in this direction.

00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:16.369 position:50% align:center
[SOUEI]
They number about 20,000.

00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:18.913 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]

00:17:18.997 --> 00:17:20.707 position:50% align:center
Well, that's perfect.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.542 position:50% align:center
[SOUEI]
Um, how so?

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:24.586 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Oh. It's not important.

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:26.212 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the report.

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:28.340 position:50% align:center
[SOUEI]
Yes. Of course.

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:31.426 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
In that case...

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:35.013 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Myulan.

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:36.765 position:50% align:center
I've made a choice.

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:38.767 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but you need to die.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:39.809 position:50% align:center
You can't!

00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:42.771 position:50% align:center
Please, Master!
It's not her fault!

00:17:42.854 --> 00:17:43.813 position:50% align:center
Grucius!

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:45.273 position:50% align:center
What's the holdup, Youm?

00:17:45.357 --> 00:17:47.692 position:50% align:center
Take Myulan and
get out of here, already!

00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:50.111 position:50% align:center
[YOUM grunts]
C'mon, let's hurry!

00:17:53.198 --> 00:17:55.533 position:50% align:center
I really did love you.
Know that.

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:56.701 position:50% align:center
[YOUM gasps]

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:57.952 position:50% align:center
[MYULAN] In fact,
you were the first man

00:17:58.036 --> 00:18:00.914 position:50% align:center
I've ever fallen in love with.

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:05.627 position:50% align:center
So try not to be deceived
by any more evil women.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.420 position:50% align:center
--Goodbye...
--[YOUM gasps] No!

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:09.881 position:50% align:center
[YOUM, GRUCIUS grunt]

00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:11.633 position:50% align:center
Don't!

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:13.635 position:50% align:center
Master, I beg you!
Don't do this!

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:15.136 position:50% align:center
I'll take her
punishment instead!

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.429 position:50% align:center
I'll do whatever you want!

00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:17.764 position:50% align:center
I admire your strength.

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:19.349 position:50% align:center
[YOUM]
I'll spend my life atoning!

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:20.767 position:50% align:center
Please!

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.560 position:50% align:center
Master... You can't!

00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:24.396 position:50% align:center
Stop it! Myulan!

00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:28.525 position:50% align:center
[GRUCIUS whimpers]

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:30.276 position:50% align:center
[YOUM gasps]

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.654 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:34.989 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:40.787 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Awesome!
That worked like a charm.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.164 position:50% align:center
What? I'm still alive!
But why?

00:18:43.248 --> 00:18:44.624 position:50% align:center
[YOUM, GRUCIUS gasp]

00:18:44.708 --> 00:18:47.252 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] You were legit dead
for like three seconds.

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:48.878 position:50% align:center
I did say you needed to die,

00:18:48.962 --> 00:18:51.131 position:50% align:center
but I never intended
to actually kill you.

00:18:51.214 --> 00:18:52.757 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:54.759 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE]
Notice. The individual Myulan's

00:18:54.843 --> 00:18:57.679 position:50% align:center
artificial heart is
operating normally.

00:18:57.762 --> 00:18:59.347 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Nice!

00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:02.392 position:50% align:center
I realized something when
I put up the third barrier.

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:04.310 position:50% align:center
The fake heart that Clayman
put inside Myulan

00:19:04.394 --> 00:19:05.854 position:50% align:center
was being used as a bug.

00:19:05.937 --> 00:19:07.814 position:50% align:center
I took the liberty
of removing it.

00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:09.399 position:50% align:center
[MYULAN]
A bug?

00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:10.942 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Yeah, this thing was emitting

00:19:11.026 --> 00:19:14.404 position:50% align:center
encrypted electrical signals
and delivering them to Clayman.

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:16.531 position:50% align:center
In order to trick him,
I had to make you believe

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:19.909 position:50% align:center
you were going to die.
I'm sorry if I scared you.

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:23.663 position:50% align:center
Oh, so... this pulse
I'm feeling...

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:25.540 position:50% align:center
Yep, it's a new
artificial heart I made

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:29.044 position:50% align:center
based on his temporary one.
Minus the bug, of course.

00:19:29.127 --> 00:19:31.379 position:50% align:center
You're a free woman.

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:34.632 position:50% align:center
Clayman can't do
anything to hurt you now.

00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:37.761 position:50% align:center
[YOUM laughs] Oh, wow,
incredible news, right?!

00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:40.388 position:50% align:center
That means you can finally
do whatever you want, Myulan!

00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:41.473 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:19:41.556 --> 00:19:43.641 position:50% align:center
You're right... Rimuru...

00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:45.852 position:50% align:center
I mean, Lord Rimuru.

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:48.104 position:50% align:center
There aren't enough words
to express just how grateful

00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:49.939 position:50% align:center
I am for your help.

00:19:50.023 --> 00:19:52.150 position:50% align:center
If you desire
my allegiance, sir,

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:54.069 position:50% align:center
I freely give it to you.

00:19:54.152 --> 00:19:56.112 position:50% align:center
--Nah, I'm good.
--[gasps]

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:59.491 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] However, I could use
your help with something.

00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:00.700 position:50% align:center
[MYULAN]
What is it?

00:20:00.784 --> 00:20:03.203 position:50% align:center
Well, just like you
came back from the dead,

00:20:03.286 --> 00:20:05.663 position:50% align:center
there's a chance I can bring
Shion and the others back.

00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:07.457 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.001 position:50% align:center
Really? Are you sure?

00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:11.920 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I'm just saying it's possible.

00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:14.255 position:50% align:center
I'm going to do everything
in my power to increase

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:18.593 position:50% align:center
my chances first.
Will you help me?

00:20:18.677 --> 00:20:22.097 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course.
I'll help however I can.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.099 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Myulan.

00:20:24.182 --> 00:20:27.686 position:50% align:center
So. What are your plans
for your newfound freedom?

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:30.355 position:50% align:center
[MYULAN]
Hmm... My plans?

00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:33.525 position:50% align:center
It's been such a long time
since I've been free.

00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:36.319 position:50% align:center
But if it's just for the short
lifespan of a human,

00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:38.738 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't mind being
tied down a bit longer.

00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
Wait. What do you mean?

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:44.369 position:50% align:center
[GRUCIUS]
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?!

00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:46.079 position:50% align:center
I don't need your comforting!

00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:48.540 position:50% align:center
Besides, Youm's
a mere human being.

00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:50.792 position:50% align:center
He'll only live
a hundred years or so.

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:52.794 position:50% align:center
After he croaks,
then it'll be my turn.

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:54.295 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?!

00:20:54.379 --> 00:20:56.798 position:50% align:center
You can't go claiming people,
you scumbag wolf!

00:20:56.881 --> 00:20:59.342 position:50% align:center
[GRUCIUS] Huh...?
Who you callin' a scumbag?

00:20:59.426 --> 00:21:00.677 position:50% align:center
By the way, Youm.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.762 position:50% align:center
I actually have something
in mind for you, too.

00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:03.888 position:50% align:center
[YOUM]
Hmm? Sure!

00:21:03.972 --> 00:21:05.598 position:50% align:center
I'll do whatever
you want after today!

00:21:05.682 --> 00:21:08.935 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Good, I want you to
become the new king of Falmuth.

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:11.187 position:50% align:center
Right! You got it!

00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:12.355 position:50% align:center
Wait.

00:21:12.439 --> 00:21:13.356 position:50% align:center
What?

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.899 position:50% align:center
King?

00:21:14.983 --> 00:21:17.152 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] What I'm saying is,
I'm going to wipe out

00:21:17.235 --> 00:21:19.821 position:50% align:center
the entire force that's
headed here from Falmuth,

00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:22.157 position:50% align:center
including their king
and his top officers.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.993 position:50% align:center
But that will be rough on
the citizens under his rule.

00:21:25.076 --> 00:21:26.786 position:50% align:center
And that's where you come in.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:30.206 position:50% align:center
You'll rule the Kingdom of
Falmuth as its brand new king.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.542 position:50% align:center
You can establish
relations with us.

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:36.087 position:50% align:center
You make it sound really simple.
I can't be a king.

00:21:36.171 --> 00:21:39.382 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Why not? I'm probably
gonna be a Demon King.

00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:40.800 position:50% align:center
You should rule, too.

00:21:40.884 --> 00:21:43.970 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru is asking
because he believes in you.

00:21:44.054 --> 00:21:45.680 position:50% align:center
You have my support, as well.

00:21:45.764 --> 00:21:47.682 position:50% align:center
Why not live life
to the fullest?

00:21:47.766 --> 00:21:49.684 position:50% align:center
[YOUM]
Hmm...

00:21:49.768 --> 00:21:51.311 position:50% align:center
I'll stick by your side, too.

00:21:51.394 --> 00:21:53.480 position:50% align:center
Then I can be there
waiting when you finally die.

00:21:53.563 --> 00:21:55.273 position:50% align:center
--Whoa, hey!
--[laughs]

00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:59.027 position:50% align:center
All right. I'm in.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:00.653 position:50% align:center
You can count on me.

00:22:00.737 --> 00:22:02.280 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Awesome!

00:22:09.871 --> 00:22:11.623 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Sorry for the wait, everyone.

00:22:11.706 --> 00:22:13.875 position:50% align:center
We're going to begin
our meeting now.

00:22:15.627 --> 00:22:17.337 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] The topics are
how we'll deal with humans

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.922 position:50% align:center
from here on out.

00:22:19.005 --> 00:22:21.966 position:50% align:center
And the resurrection
of Shion and the others.

00:23:54.017 --> 00:23:56.978 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE] Next time, "Putting
Everything on the Line."
