[RIMURU]
After a four-day journey,

00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:25.542 align:middle
we had finally
arrived in Dwargon.

00:00:27.417 --> 00:00:29.042 align:middle
[RIMURU] We were immediately
granted an audience

00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:32.042 align:middle
with the king himself,
Gazel Dwargo.

00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.292 align:middle
[RIMURU]
I want to start by thanking you.

00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:07.875 align:middle
For pardoning
the crimes of Kaijin

00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.625 align:middle
and the three Dwarf brothers.

00:02:09.708 --> 00:02:12.500 align:middle
Back then, exiling them
was my only option.

00:02:12.583 --> 00:02:15.500 align:middle
A lesser punishment wouldn't
have satisfied my ministers.

00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:19.625 align:middle
Wait. So does that mean you
wanted to let them off easy?

00:02:19.708 --> 00:02:22.458 align:middle
Perhaps. Though, I admit
I had my own concerns.

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:24.083 align:middle
Being the strange
creature you are,

00:02:24.167 --> 00:02:26.750 align:middle
it seemed best to get rid of all
of you for the time being.

00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:28.625 align:middle
[chuckles nervously]

00:02:28.708 --> 00:02:31.000 align:middle
[GAZEL] That said, it broke
my heart to forcibly send

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:33.958 align:middle
Kaijin, Garm, Dord
and Myrd away.

00:02:34.042 --> 00:02:36.708 align:middle
[RIMURU] Well, thanks to Garm,
we have high-quality armor now.

00:02:36.792 --> 00:02:39.042 align:middle
Not to mention, Dord and Myrd
have been a huge help

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:40.625 align:middle
with our construction projects.

00:02:40.708 --> 00:02:43.125 align:middle
And of course, Kaijin takes
care of all kinds of matters

00:02:43.208 --> 00:02:45.458 align:middle
that are way beyond
any of my abilities.

00:02:45.542 --> 00:02:47.667 align:middle
I have no doubt that Tempest
wouldn't be the same

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.208 align:middle
without them.

00:02:49.292 --> 00:02:51.875 align:middle
I thought they would be better
off in a different environment.

00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.042 align:middle
One where they could make
use of their talents freely,

00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:56.375 align:middle
rather than living in obscurity.

00:02:56.458 --> 00:02:59.125 align:middle
What happened to Vesta?
Is he with you?

00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:01.833 align:middle
Oh, I did invite him
to come with me.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.292 align:middle
[VESTA]
Hmm. I appreciate it,

00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:08.583 align:middle
but I simply can't bring
myself to face King Gazel

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:11.292 align:middle
until I've produced some
sort of result.

00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:12.750 align:middle
So he said.

00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:16.417 align:middle
[laughs]
Sounds like Vesta.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.792 align:middle
But I suppose that means
he's finally found a place

00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:21.083 align:middle
where he can exercise
his talents to their fullest.

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:23.917 align:middle
[laughs]

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.125 align:middle
Now, Rimuru...

00:03:25.208 --> 00:03:26.375 align:middle
Uh?

00:03:26.458 --> 00:03:28.625 align:middle
[GAZEL]
I need to ask you something.

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:31.417 align:middle
I know. I've had a feeling.

00:03:32.875 --> 00:03:35.417 align:middle
[GAZEL]
In the battle against Charybdis,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.083 align:middle
you utilized a high-output
magical weapon.

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:39.917 align:middle
Can you enlighten me
with the details?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.167 align:middle
[RIMURU groans softly]

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.125 align:middle
[GAZEL] I heard it was
an unprecedented force

00:03:43.208 --> 00:03:45.750 align:middle
that surpassed all
tactical magic.

00:03:45.833 --> 00:03:47.083 align:middle
Yeah, about that.

00:03:47.167 --> 00:03:49.500 align:middle
What if I said it was
Demon Lord Milim's power?

00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:51.167 align:middle
Seriously?

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.542 align:middle
Yes, he made a similar joke
the day we defeated Charybdis.

00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:56.458 align:middle
Except it's kinda true.

00:03:56.542 --> 00:03:59.125 align:middle
Sorry, that's impossible
to believe.

00:03:59.208 --> 00:04:01.000 align:middle
You mean that child...

00:04:01.083 --> 00:04:03.083 align:middle
[MILIM]
Yay! It's me!

00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:05.583 align:middle
[DORF] ...is a Catastrophe-class
Demon Lord?

00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:09.208 align:middle
[RIMURU] Look, I totally
get why it sounds crazy.

00:04:09.292 --> 00:04:10.500 align:middle
Heh.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:11.792 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:13.042 align:middle
Uh?

00:04:13.125 --> 00:04:16.750 align:middle
It's too preposterous
to be mere boasting.

00:04:16.833 --> 00:04:19.458 align:middle
All right. I've decided
to believe you.

00:04:19.542 --> 00:04:21.333 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Huh?

00:04:21.417 --> 00:04:22.500 align:middle
[sighs]

00:04:22.583 --> 00:04:24.083 align:middle
Got that? You, too.

00:04:24.167 --> 00:04:26.375 align:middle
[sighs]
Yes, sir.

00:04:26.458 --> 00:04:27.750 align:middle
But when did you become
acquainted with

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:29.500 align:middle
the oldest of the Demon Lords?

00:04:29.583 --> 00:04:31.958 align:middle
You are truly full of surprises,
Lord Rimuru.

00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:33.625 align:middle
[SHION]
Hmm!

00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:35.625 align:middle
[giggles]

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:38.958 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Why is Shion acting so proud?

00:04:39.042 --> 00:04:40.375 align:middle
Thank you for waiting.

00:04:40.458 --> 00:04:42.792 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Uh?

00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:44.333 align:middle
What is this?

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:47.167 align:middle
[RIMURU] Ah, just
a small gift from Tempest.

00:04:59.333 --> 00:05:00.250 align:middle
For you.

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:01.583 align:middle
[GAZEL]
Hmm.

00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:03.875 align:middle
[SHUNA]
Please have one.

00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.333 align:middle
[DORF]
Thank you.

00:05:05.417 --> 00:05:07.375 align:middle
Hold on.

00:05:07.458 --> 00:05:09.292 align:middle
Did Dord make these glasses?

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:11.500 align:middle
Yep, you guessed it.

00:05:11.583 --> 00:05:13.250 align:middle
[GAZEL]
Hmm...

00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:14.917 align:middle
It's magnificent.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.750 align:middle
The translucence,
the delicate appearance.

00:05:18.833 --> 00:05:21.250 align:middle
And is this detoxifying
rune magic?

00:05:21.333 --> 00:05:22.833 align:middle
How thoughtful.

00:05:26.458 --> 00:05:29.667 align:middle
Would you like me
to taste it for poison?

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.375 align:middle
I would never actually suspect
you of trying to poison me.

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:36.250 align:middle
[sniffs]
Such a lovely aroma.

00:05:40.167 --> 00:05:41.875 align:middle
Oh! This drink is...

00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.583 align:middle
[gasps]

00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:45.292 align:middle
...superb.

00:05:45.375 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle
I agree.

00:05:47.083 --> 00:05:48.417 align:middle
Bottoms up.

00:05:50.292 --> 00:05:52.792 align:middle
Ah! Tasty!

00:05:52.875 --> 00:05:56.458 align:middle
[GREAT SAGE] Notice.
Poison Resistance successful.

00:05:56.542 --> 00:05:57.958 align:middle
[RIMURU]
No, stop succeeding!

00:05:58.042 --> 00:06:00.417 align:middle
What's the point of good booze
if you're gonna erase it?!

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.417 align:middle
[GAZEL]
What's wrong?

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.208 align:middle
Uh! It's nothing important.

00:06:04.292 --> 00:06:06.708 align:middle
This is a distilled liquor
made from apples.

00:06:06.792 --> 00:06:09.042 align:middle
We're working on the prospect
of importing more fruit,

00:06:09.125 --> 00:06:11.250 align:middle
so we should be able
to make more soon.

00:06:11.333 --> 00:06:14.000 align:middle
[GAZEL] Importing? Does that
mean you've found other nations

00:06:14.083 --> 00:06:17.542 align:middle
with which to establish
new relations besides Dwargon?

00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:19.875 align:middle
The Kingdom of Blumund, perhaps?

00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.792 align:middle
Yeah. But not just with them.

00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:23.333 align:middle
The fruit's from
the Animal Kingdom--

00:06:23.417 --> 00:06:24.625 align:middle
From Eurazania?!

00:06:24.708 --> 00:06:26.167 align:middle
Uh. Yes?

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.833 align:middle
That arrogant Beast King made
a deal with another nation?!

00:06:28.917 --> 00:06:31.333 align:middle
First, you earned the favor
of Demon Lord Milim,

00:06:31.417 --> 00:06:34.208 align:middle
and now with Demon Lord
Carrion, as well?

00:06:34.292 --> 00:06:36.208 align:middle
Are you a seducer
of Demon Lords?

00:06:36.292 --> 00:06:37.500 align:middle
[RIMURU]
No, not at all!

00:06:37.583 --> 00:06:39.333 align:middle
I just happened to help out
someone who serves

00:06:39.417 --> 00:06:40.750 align:middle
the Demon Lord Carrion.

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:43.042 align:middle
After that, it sort of led
to discussions of trade

00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:44.583 align:middle
between our nations.

00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:48.875 align:middle
In fact, we only just recently
sent delegations to each other.

00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.125 align:middle
You must realize this
will cause the importance

00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:53.042 align:middle
of Tempest to skyrocket.

00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:55.292 align:middle
It's quite possible it could
replace the Kingdom of Falmuth

00:06:55.375 --> 00:06:57.583 align:middle
as the major trade center.

00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:59.625 align:middle
Yes. That's a fair point.

00:06:59.708 --> 00:07:01.375 align:middle
I seriously doubt it.

00:07:01.458 --> 00:07:03.917 align:middle
Plus, our main goal is to finish
establishing transport routes

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.833 align:middle
so our trades can run smoothly.

00:07:05.917 --> 00:07:08.042 align:middle
[GAZEL] Setting aside
talk of the future.

00:07:08.125 --> 00:07:11.042 align:middle
I admit this drink is far better
than any alcohol I've imported

00:07:11.125 --> 00:07:13.000 align:middle
from Falmuth directly.

00:07:13.083 --> 00:07:15.458 align:middle
I hope your
partnership succeeds.

00:07:16.833 --> 00:07:18.833 align:middle
[RIMURU]
The Kingdom of Falmuth, huh?

00:07:18.917 --> 00:07:22.292 align:middle
I'm pretty sure that's the
country that Youm is from.

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:25.083 align:middle
Ah... Ah-choo!
[sniffles]

00:07:25.167 --> 00:07:26.542 align:middle
You sick?

00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:29.833 align:middle
No way. I bet you anything
someone's talking about me.

00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:31.042 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Now that I think about it,

00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:33.333 align:middle
he doesn't mention
his home very much.

00:07:33.417 --> 00:07:36.292 align:middle
What's the Kingdom of
Falmuth like, anyway?

00:07:36.375 --> 00:07:38.500 align:middle
Well. I'd rank it as
number one or two

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:40.500 align:middle
among all the Western Provinces.

00:07:40.583 --> 00:07:42.875 align:middle
Our nation also depends
on imports from Falmuth,

00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.208 align:middle
as well as the empire,
for most of our food.

00:07:46.292 --> 00:07:49.375 align:middle
Although... Between
just you and me?

00:07:49.458 --> 00:07:52.083 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Huh...?

00:07:52.167 --> 00:07:54.083 align:middle
I don't care for Falmuth's king.

00:07:54.167 --> 00:07:55.292 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Whoa, for real?

00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:57.667 align:middle
He's too greedy
for his own good.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.333 align:middle
So no matter what it takes, you
must succeed in your trade talks

00:08:00.417 --> 00:08:01.500 align:middle
with Eurazania.

00:08:01.583 --> 00:08:03.583 align:middle
Understand?
And one more thing--

00:08:03.667 --> 00:08:06.292 align:middle
make sure you supply your senior
with plenty of tasty alcohol.

00:08:06.375 --> 00:08:11.167 align:middle
[RIMURU groans] I'm starting to
think you have ulterior motives.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:12.750 align:middle
Worry not, sir!

00:08:12.833 --> 00:08:14.000 align:middle
Whoo!

00:08:14.083 --> 00:08:18.375 align:middle
Ah! Shion?
When did you start drinking?

00:08:18.458 --> 00:08:21.083 align:middle
Bwah! Leave it to my lord!

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:23.833 align:middle
He'll have that trade
locked in no time splat!

00:08:23.917 --> 00:08:24.958 align:middle
Ka-boom!

00:08:25.042 --> 00:08:26.917 align:middle
Like a trade explosion!

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.292 align:middle
--[RIMURU] What?!
--[SHION laughs]

00:08:28.375 --> 00:08:30.417 align:middle
'Cause of him,
our food tastes yummy!

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.333 align:middle
Every single meal
on our table is like

00:08:32.417 --> 00:08:34.417 align:middle
an imported feast, y'know?

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.333 align:middle
And y'can bet your royal bottom
that more delicious booze

00:08:37.417 --> 00:08:40.250 align:middle
like this is gonna be
rolled in by the barrelful!

00:08:40.333 --> 00:08:43.083 align:middle
You can trust Lord Rimuru!

00:08:43.167 --> 00:08:44.667 align:middle
[SHUNA whimpers]

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.083 align:middle

Ah...

[gasps]

00:08:50.625 --> 00:08:52.667 align:middle
[RIMURU]
And safe...

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.250 align:middle
[gasps]

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:56.625 align:middle
[SHION moans softly]

00:08:56.708 --> 00:08:59.833 align:middle
[RIMURU] Holy wow, what am
I gonna do with this girl?

00:08:59.917 --> 00:09:01.458 align:middle
I'm sorry!

00:09:01.542 --> 00:09:04.375 align:middle
Please forgive
my companion's rudeness!

00:09:04.458 --> 00:09:06.500 align:middle
[BOTH laugh]

00:09:06.583 --> 00:09:07.625 align:middle
[SHUNA]
Hmm...?

00:09:07.708 --> 00:09:09.625 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Yeah, sorry about my secretary.

00:09:09.708 --> 00:09:13.542 align:middle
It's fine. You should take
her to go get some rest.

00:09:13.625 --> 00:09:15.333 align:middle
Right. Please pardon us.

00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:20.417 align:middle
[SHUNA]
How embarrassing.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.708 align:middle
You can say that again.

00:09:22.792 --> 00:09:25.917 align:middle
[SHION chuckles softly]

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.375 align:middle
Somehow... I still wanna live up
to her expectations, though.

00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:33.792 align:middle
Shuna. Once we're
back in our quarters,

00:09:33.875 --> 00:09:35.917 align:middle
let's go over the speech
one more time.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.333 align:middle
Right!

00:09:41.333 --> 00:09:43.542 align:middle
[RIMURU]
The night passed.

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:46.125 align:middle
And the next day, we had a big
rally to publicly announce

00:09:46.208 --> 00:09:49.917 align:middle
the declaration of friendship
between Dwargon and Tempest.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.833 align:middle
Basically, it's an opportunity
to stand before

00:09:51.917 --> 00:09:54.625 align:middle
the king's citizens and show
them that we're friends.

00:09:54.708 --> 00:09:56.208 align:middle
More or less.

00:09:56.292 --> 00:09:58.625 align:middle
My being here doesn't
just represent me,

00:09:58.708 --> 00:10:01.167 align:middle
but all of Tempest, as well.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.000 align:middle
It's important that I give
a proper greeting

00:10:03.083 --> 00:10:05.125 align:middle
and make a good impression.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.375 align:middle
Nice to meet you!

00:10:13.458 --> 00:10:14.625 align:middle
Wah!

00:10:14.708 --> 00:10:16.375 align:middle
Ahem!

00:10:16.458 --> 00:10:19.042 align:middle
I'm the leader of the Jura
Tempest Federation,

00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:20.667 align:middle
or Tempest for short.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.708 align:middle
I'm Rimuru Tempest.

00:10:22.792 --> 00:10:26.125 align:middle
[cheering, applause]

00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:28.125 align:middle
[applause]

00:10:28.208 --> 00:10:30.375 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Oh! Thank you so much!

00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:35.375 align:middle
[RIMURU] So, my biggest wish
is to build a nation

00:10:35.458 --> 00:10:36.500 align:middle
that will serve as a bridge

00:10:36.583 --> 00:10:40.042 align:middle
between monster
and human society.

00:10:40.125 --> 00:10:42.958 align:middle
Dwargon is already a nation in
which monsters and humans

00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:48.125 align:middle
both exist and prosper together.
You've already achieved my goal.

00:10:48.208 --> 00:10:51.250 align:middle
I couldn't be more grateful to
King Gazel for his endorsement

00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:54.333 align:middle
and overall support
of my ideal nation.

00:10:54.417 --> 00:10:56.708 align:middle
I would like to continue
to uphold our relationship

00:10:56.792 --> 00:10:59.542 align:middle
of mutual aid, but to do that,
I'm going to need

00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:02.333 align:middle
everyone's cooperation.

00:11:02.417 --> 00:11:05.042 align:middle
In addition to myself,
there are many other monsters

00:11:05.125 --> 00:11:07.208 align:middle
who call our country home.

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:11.042 align:middle
It would be fair to say
we're a nation of monsters.

00:11:11.125 --> 00:11:13.667 align:middle
But the truth is, in our hearts,
we're no different

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.958 align:middle
from any of the citizens here.

00:11:17.042 --> 00:11:20.625 align:middle
I hope that, instead of fearing
us because we're monsters,

00:11:20.708 --> 00:11:23.750 align:middle
you'll accept us
as your new allies.

00:11:23.833 --> 00:11:27.250 align:middle
I promise you that my words
convey only my honest feelings.

00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:30.958 align:middle
And with that, I'll conclude
my greeting to you.

00:11:31.042 --> 00:11:33.458 align:middle
[cheering, applause]

00:11:33.542 --> 00:11:35.583 align:middle

[RIMURU sighs]

00:11:43.625 --> 00:11:48.042 align:middle
[RIMURU] Well... I guess
we can call my speech a success!

00:11:48.125 --> 00:11:50.458 align:middle
Way too short.
Atrociously humble.

00:11:50.542 --> 00:11:54.417 align:middle
Too dependent on their sympathy.
I award you zero points.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.917 align:middle
[RIMURU groans]

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.333 align:middle
[GAZEL] The ruler of a nation
shouldn't address citizens

00:11:57.417 --> 00:11:58.667 align:middle
with such humility.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.333 align:middle
Especially not the citizens
of a foreign nation.

00:12:01.417 --> 00:12:03.208 align:middle
They'll look down on you.

00:12:03.292 --> 00:12:04.625 align:middle
[RIMURU groans]

00:12:04.708 --> 00:12:07.042 align:middle
You cannot rule with such weak
thoughts like, "I hope,"

00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:08.542 align:middle
and, "I wish."

00:12:08.625 --> 00:12:11.125 align:middle
Wonderful things don't come
about by using pretty words.

00:12:11.208 --> 00:12:14.333 align:middle
No, you have to make
them come about yourself.

00:12:14.417 --> 00:12:15.833 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Right...

00:12:15.917 --> 00:12:18.125 align:middle
[RIMURU] Man, I totally
sucked at giving speeches

00:12:18.208 --> 00:12:19.958 align:middle
back when I was a human, too.

00:12:20.042 --> 00:12:21.750 align:middle
Some things never change.

00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:25.083 align:middle
[RIMURU] But... I don't think
he'd be so honest with me

00:12:25.167 --> 00:12:28.958 align:middle
unless he was sincere
about wanting this to succeed.

00:12:29.042 --> 00:12:31.708 align:middle
I really am blessed with
some awesome friendships.

00:12:31.792 --> 00:12:33.333 align:middle
I should thank him.

00:12:35.375 --> 00:12:37.833 align:middle
[RIMURU] Somehow or another,
I managed to make it through

00:12:37.917 --> 00:12:41.000 align:middle
my big speech in the
Armed Nation of Dwargon.

00:12:41.083 --> 00:12:44.333 align:middle
[RIMURU] To celebrate,
I decided to treat myself a bit.

00:12:45.458 --> 00:12:47.792 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Yep. When it comes to Dwargon,

00:12:47.875 --> 00:12:50.833 align:middle
there's always one place
I make sure to visit!

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.792 align:middle
[RIMURU] It's the
Butterflies of the Night.

You didn't let Shuna or Shion
see you leave, right?

We're good, sir!

00:13:07.542 --> 00:13:08.667 align:middle

you'd forgotten about us,

feels more natural.

with my human form?

wrong with it, per se.

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:00.500 align:middle
[ELF WOMAN 4J]
I was joking!

00:16:00.583 --> 00:16:02.750 align:middle
[GOBTA whimpering]

00:16:04.542 --> 00:16:06.333 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Excuse me, do you have a minute?

00:16:06.417 --> 00:16:08.292 align:middle
[OWNER 4A]
For you? I have several.

00:16:08.375 --> 00:16:11.667 align:middle
[RIMURU] Do you think this is
something you could sell here?

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:13.083 align:middle
[OWNER 4A]
What is it?

00:16:13.167 --> 00:16:14.750 align:middle
[RIMURU] A new kind of liquor
produced in my country.

00:16:14.833 --> 00:16:16.458 align:middle
Unfortunately,
I can't give you much,

00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:18.458 align:middle
since I have to save
some for the King,

00:16:18.542 --> 00:16:20.833 align:middle
but you could reserve it
for some of your regulars.

00:16:20.917 --> 00:16:22.458 align:middle
I'd love to hear their thoughts.

00:16:22.542 --> 00:16:25.167 align:middle
Interesting.
Are you sure, though?

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.042 align:middle
[RIMURU] Yep! All I need
is for you to research

00:16:27.125 --> 00:16:29.667 align:middle
how much someone's
willing to pay for one glass.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.958 align:middle
Well, now. You're quite
a business-slime, aren't you?

00:16:33.042 --> 00:16:35.125 align:middle
--[RIMURU chuckles]
--[OWNER 4A giggles]

00:16:35.208 --> 00:16:37.500 align:middle
I didn't know you could be
such a smooth talker.

00:16:37.583 --> 00:16:38.958 align:middle
Your speech was so stiff.

00:16:39.042 --> 00:16:40.333 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Wait, you were watching?

00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:41.833 align:middle
Quite closely.

00:16:41.917 --> 00:16:45.125 align:middle
[RIMURU] Oh, that was just, um,
you know, part of my plan!

00:16:45.208 --> 00:16:46.458 align:middle
I wanted to look humble.

00:16:46.542 --> 00:16:49.292 align:middle
[OWNER 4A chuckles]
Don't worry, I believe you.

00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:52.458 align:middle
For what it's worth, you made
a good impression on me.

00:16:52.542 --> 00:16:54.833 align:middle
You came off as very sincere.

00:16:54.917 --> 00:16:57.083 align:middle
I think it's
an important quality.

00:16:57.167 --> 00:16:59.000 align:middle
And it draws people to you.

00:16:59.083 --> 00:17:00.458 align:middle
Well done.

00:17:00.542 --> 00:17:03.500 align:middle
In that respect, I would've
given you a perfect score.

00:17:05.292 --> 00:17:06.375 align:middle
[RIMURU gasps]

00:17:06.458 --> 00:17:09.708 align:middle
Your goal is appealing.
A mixed nation.

00:17:09.792 --> 00:17:12.542 align:middle
Yes. One that
welcomes all races.

00:17:12.625 --> 00:17:14.500 align:middle
Where we can all live freely.

00:17:14.583 --> 00:17:18.917 align:middle
[RIMURU chuckles]
That means a lot.

00:17:21.667 --> 00:17:22.917 align:middle
[OWNER 4A giggles]

00:17:24.042 --> 00:17:26.542 align:middle
[RIMURU] After that,
we partied maybe a bit too late

00:17:26.625 --> 00:17:27.875 align:middle
into the night.

00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:32.292 align:middle
[DWARVES laughing,
muttering indistinctly]

00:17:36.875 --> 00:17:38.417 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Bunch of drunks.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.250 align:middle
Plus, someone's anemic now.

00:17:41.333 --> 00:17:44.292 align:middle
Hey, Gobta, you good?

00:17:44.375 --> 00:17:45.583 align:middle
I feel dizzy...

00:17:45.667 --> 00:17:47.042 align:middle
[RIMURU]
I'm sure.

00:17:47.125 --> 00:17:48.375 align:middle
Listen up, boys.

00:17:48.458 --> 00:17:50.000 align:middle
Don't let anyone see you
when you head back

00:17:50.083 --> 00:17:51.625 align:middle
to your rooms, okay?

00:17:51.708 --> 00:17:54.792 align:middle
The dream we enjoyed
tonight is our little secret!

00:17:54.875 --> 00:17:55.833 align:middle
[GOBLIN BOYS]
Right!

00:17:55.917 --> 00:17:57.833 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Then we're off!

00:17:57.917 --> 00:17:59.417 align:middle
[SHUNA]
Can I be of assistance?

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.625 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Yeah, that'd be gr--

00:18:00.708 --> 00:18:03.792 align:middle
Wah!

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:05.000 align:middle
Sh-Sh-Sh-Sh--

00:18:05.083 --> 00:18:07.125 align:middle
[GREAT SAGE] Notice.
Intense energy detected

00:18:07.208 --> 00:18:08.542 align:middle
behind her smile.

00:18:08.625 --> 00:18:10.250 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Tell me something I don't know!

00:18:10.333 --> 00:18:13.042 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh--

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:15.125 align:middle
Why am I here, you ask?

00:18:15.208 --> 00:18:17.833 align:middle
[RIMURU gasps, grunts]

00:18:17.917 --> 00:18:21.542 align:middle
Well, Gobzo was polite
enough to tell me everything.

00:18:21.625 --> 00:18:23.042 align:middle
[RIMURU gasps]
Gobzo?!

00:18:23.125 --> 00:18:24.542 align:middle
How could you, you traitor?!

00:18:24.625 --> 00:18:26.417 align:middle
Oh, uh. Easy.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.083 align:middle
Princess Shuna asked me to tell
her where we were all going.

00:18:29.167 --> 00:18:30.583 align:middle
She's so friendly.

00:18:30.667 --> 00:18:33.250 align:middle
[RIMURU]
You've doomed us all, you fool!

00:18:33.333 --> 00:18:34.958 align:middle
[SHION]
You're terrible, Lord Rimuru.

00:18:35.042 --> 00:18:36.583 align:middle
[RIMURU gasps]

00:18:39.083 --> 00:18:41.417 align:middle
You left us behind.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.708 align:middle
How dare you!

00:18:42.792 --> 00:18:45.333 align:middle
[RIMURU] Listen, Shion,
it's not what you think!

[screams]

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:48.250 align:middle
How could you go
without telling us?!

00:18:48.333 --> 00:18:49.792 align:middle
[RIMURU wailing]

00:18:49.875 --> 00:18:51.875 align:middle
[SHION groans]

00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:53.500 align:middle
As for you boys...

00:18:53.583 --> 00:18:56.250 align:middle
Were you also involved in this
plan to sneak out tonight...?

--[SHION] Ugh!

of stopping you.

You're free to do
whatever you wish, my lord.

Although... I am a little
disappointed in you.

[RIMURU] An excuse will
only make things worse.

00:19:23.792 --> 00:19:25.708 align:middle
Time to own up to this!

00:19:25.792 --> 00:19:27.667 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Please forgive me!

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.292 align:middle
And now, I have no excuse!

Yes! Do your best, Shion!

Way too short.
Atrociously humble.

00:19:59.792 --> 00:20:02.000 align:middle
Too dependent on their sympathy.

it down to three days?

Nope, one week.

[RIMURU] Maybe things
didn't end as planned,

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.167 align:middle
but with our tasks
completed in Dwargon,

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.583 align:middle
we were finally ready
to head back home.

That's him.

Hey.

This is my sister.
She was hoping to meet with you.

00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:43.958 align:middle
Do you have a minute?

00:20:44.042 --> 00:20:45.500 align:middle
Sister?

00:20:48.167 --> 00:20:50.500 align:middle
I happen to be
very good with magic.

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:53.292 align:middle
I think I could prove
to be useful to your party.

00:20:53.375 --> 00:20:54.833 align:middle
It would seem...

00:20:54.917 --> 00:20:58.125 align:middle
...that you're a bit lacking
when it comes to magic users.

00:20:58.208 --> 00:21:01.125 align:middle
Yeah, I'll pass. We're actually
good on that front.

00:21:01.208 --> 00:21:04.667 align:middle
What could a mere woman
like you do, anyway?

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:06.542 align:middle
[MYULAN]
Hmph. Well, by all means,

00:21:06.625 --> 00:21:09.542 align:middle
allow me to show you what
a "mere woman" can do.

I will beat you!

It's over.

00:21:44.667 --> 00:21:47.417 align:middle
Pathetic, I had no idea
you lacked basic resistance

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.292 align:middle
to abnormal statuses.

00:21:49.375 --> 00:21:52.542 align:middle
You have practically
no defense against magic.
