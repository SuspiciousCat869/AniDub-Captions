[RIMURU]
After a four-day journey,

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:25.608 position:50% align:center
we had finally
arrived in Dwargon.

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:29.070 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] We were immediately
granted an audience

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:32.115 position:50% align:center
with the king himself,
Gazel Dwargo.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:06.292 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I want to start by thanking you.

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:07.877 position:50% align:center
For pardoning
the crimes of Kaijin

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.629 position:50% align:center
and the three Dwarf brothers.

00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:12.507 position:50% align:center
Back then, exiling them
was my only option.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.510 position:50% align:center
A lesser punishment wouldn't
have satisfied my ministers.

00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:19.639 position:50% align:center
Wait. So does that mean you
wanted to let them off easy?

00:02:19.723 --> 00:02:22.475 position:50% align:center
Perhaps. Though, I admit
I had my own concerns.

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:24.102 position:50% align:center
Being the strange
creature you are,

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:26.771 position:50% align:center
it seemed best to get rid of all
of you for the time being.

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:28.648 position:50% align:center
[chuckles nervously]

00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:31.026 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL] That said, it broke
my heart to forcibly send

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.987 position:50% align:center
Kaijin, Garm, Dord
and Myrd away.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.740 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Well, thanks to Garm,
we have high-quality armor now.

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:39.075 position:50% align:center
Not to mention, Dord and Myrd
have been a huge help

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.660 position:50% align:center
with our construction projects.

00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:43.121 position:50% align:center
And of course, Kaijin takes
care of all kinds of matters

00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:45.457 position:50% align:center
that are way beyond
any of my abilities.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.667 position:50% align:center
I have no doubt that Tempest
wouldn't be the same

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:49.210 position:50% align:center
without them.

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:51.880 position:50% align:center
I thought they would be better
off in a different environment.

00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:54.049 position:50% align:center
One where they could make
use of their talents freely,

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:56.384 position:50% align:center
rather than living in obscurity.

00:02:56.468 --> 00:02:59.137 position:50% align:center
What happened to Vesta?
Is he with you?

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.890 position:50% align:center
Oh, I did invite him
to come with me.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:06.311 position:50% align:center
[VESTA]
Hmm. I appreciate it,

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:08.605 position:50% align:center
but I simply can't bring
myself to face King Gazel

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:11.316 position:50% align:center
until I've produced some
sort of result.

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:12.776 position:50% align:center
So he said.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.446 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
Sounds like Vesta.

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.823 position:50% align:center
But I suppose that means
he's finally found a place

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:21.117 position:50% align:center
where he can exercise
his talents to their fullest.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.953 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:25.121 position:50% align:center
Now, Rimuru...

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.373 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:28.625 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL]
I need to ask you something.

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:31.461 position:50% align:center
I know. I've had a feeling.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.423 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL]
In the battle against Charybdis,

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:38.093 position:50% align:center
you utilized a high-output
magical weapon.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:39.928 position:50% align:center
Can you enlighten me
with the details?

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:41.179 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU groans softly]

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL] I heard it was
an unprecedented force

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.767 position:50% align:center
that surpassed all
tactical magic.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.102 position:50% align:center
Yeah, about that.

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:49.521 position:50% align:center
What if I said it was
Demon Lord Milim's power?

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:51.189 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:54.567 position:50% align:center
Yes, he made a similar joke
the day we defeated Charybdis.

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:56.486 position:50% align:center
Except it's kinda true.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.155 position:50% align:center
Sorry, that's impossible
to believe.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.032 position:50% align:center
You mean that child...

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:03.118 position:50% align:center
[MILIM]
Yay! It's me!

00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:05.620 position:50% align:center
[DORF] ...is a Catastrophe-class
Demon Lord?

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:09.207 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Look, I totally
get why it sounds crazy.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.500 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:11.793 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:13.044 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:16.756 position:50% align:center
It's too preposterous
to be mere boasting.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.467 position:50% align:center
All right. I've decided
to believe you.

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:21.344 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Huh?

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:22.512 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.097 position:50% align:center
Got that? You, too.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.391 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
Yes, sir.

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:27.767 position:50% align:center
But when did you become
acquainted with

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:29.519 position:50% align:center
the oldest of the Demon Lords?

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:31.980 position:50% align:center
You are truly full of surprises,
Lord Rimuru.

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:33.648 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
Hmm!

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:35.650 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:38.987 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Why is Shion acting so proud?

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.405 position:50% align:center
Thank you for waiting.

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:42.824 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Uh?

00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:44.367 position:50% align:center
What is this?

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:47.245 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Ah, just
a small gift from Tempest.

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:00.258 position:50% align:center
For you.

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:01.634 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL]
Hmm.

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:03.887 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA]
Please have one.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.347 position:50% align:center
[DORF]
Thank you.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.390 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.309 position:50% align:center
Did Dord make these glasses?

00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:11.519 position:50% align:center
Yep, you guessed it.

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:13.271 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL]
Hmm...

00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:14.939 position:50% align:center
It's magnificent.

00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:18.777 position:50% align:center
The translucence,
the delicate appearance.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.279 position:50% align:center
And is this detoxifying
rune magic?

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:22.906 position:50% align:center
How thoughtful.

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:29.662 position:50% align:center
Would you like me
to taste it for poison?

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:33.375 position:50% align:center
I would never actually suspect
you of trying to poison me.

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:36.294 position:50% align:center
[sniffs]
Such a lovely aroma.

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.883 position:50% align:center
Oh! This drink is...

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:43.593 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:45.303 position:50% align:center
...superb.

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:47.013 position:50% align:center
I agree.

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:48.473 position:50% align:center
Bottoms up.

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:52.811 position:50% align:center
Ah! Tasty!

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:56.481 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE] Notice.
Poison Resistance successful.

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:57.982 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
No, stop succeeding!

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:00.443 position:50% align:center
What's the point of good booze
if you're gonna erase it?!

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:01.444 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL]
What's wrong?

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:04.239 position:50% align:center
Uh! It's nothing important.

00:06:04.322 --> 00:06:06.741 position:50% align:center
This is a distilled liquor
made from apples.

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:09.077 position:50% align:center
We're working on the prospect
of importing more fruit,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.246 position:50% align:center
so we should be able
to make more soon.

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:13.998 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL] Importing? Does that
mean you've found other nations

00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:17.544 position:50% align:center
with which to establish
new relations besides Dwargon?

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:19.879 position:50% align:center
The Kingdom of Blumund, perhaps?

00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:21.798 position:50% align:center
Yeah. But not just with them.

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.341 position:50% align:center
The fruit's from
the Animal Kingdom--

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:24.634 position:50% align:center
From Eurazania?!

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:26.177 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yes?

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:28.847 position:50% align:center
That arrogant Beast King made
a deal with another nation?!

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.349 position:50% align:center
First, you earned the favor
of Demon Lord Milim,

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:34.227 position:50% align:center
and now with Demon Lord
Carrion, as well?

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.229 position:50% align:center
Are you a seducer
of Demon Lords?

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:37.522 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
No, not at all!

00:06:37.605 --> 00:06:39.357 position:50% align:center
I just happened to help out
someone who serves

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:40.775 position:50% align:center
the Demon Lord Carrion.

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:43.069 position:50% align:center
After that, it sort of led
to discussions of trade

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:44.612 position:50% align:center
between our nations.

00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:48.908 position:50% align:center
In fact, we only just recently
sent delegations to each other.

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:51.161 position:50% align:center
You must realize this
will cause the importance

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:53.038 position:50% align:center
of Tempest to skyrocket.

00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:55.290 position:50% align:center
It's quite possible it could
replace the Kingdom of Falmuth

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:57.584 position:50% align:center
as the major trade center.

00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:59.627 position:50% align:center
Yes. That's a fair point.

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:01.379 position:50% align:center
I seriously doubt it.

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:03.923 position:50% align:center
Plus, our main goal is to finish
establishing transport routes

00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:05.842 position:50% align:center
so our trades can run smoothly.

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:08.053 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL] Setting aside
talk of the future.

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:11.056 position:50% align:center
I admit this drink is far better
than any alcohol I've imported

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:13.016 position:50% align:center
from Falmuth directly.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.518 position:50% align:center
I hope your
partnership succeeds.

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:18.855 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
The Kingdom of Falmuth, huh?

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:22.317 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure that's the
country that Youm is from.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.111 position:50% align:center
Ah... Ah-choo!
[sniffles]

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:26.571 position:50% align:center
You sick?

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:29.866 position:50% align:center
No way. I bet you anything
someone's talking about me.

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.076 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Now that I think about it,

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:33.370 position:50% align:center
he doesn't mention
his home very much.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:36.289 position:50% align:center
What's the Kingdom of
Falmuth like, anyway?

00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:38.500 position:50% align:center
Well. I'd rank it as
number one or two

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:40.502 position:50% align:center
among all the Western Provinces.

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:42.879 position:50% align:center
Our nation also depends
on imports from Falmuth,

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:46.216 position:50% align:center
as well as the empire,
for most of our food.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:49.386 position:50% align:center
Although... Between
just you and me?

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:52.097 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Huh...?

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.099 position:50% align:center
I don't care for Falmuth's king.

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:55.308 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Whoa, for real?

00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:57.686 position:50% align:center
He's too greedy
for his own good.

00:07:57.769 --> 00:08:00.355 position:50% align:center
So no matter what it takes, you
must succeed in your trade talks

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:01.523 position:50% align:center
with Eurazania.

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:03.608 position:50% align:center
Understand?
And one more thing--

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:06.319 position:50% align:center
make sure you supply your senior
with plenty of tasty alcohol.

00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:11.199 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU groans] I'm starting to
think you have ulterior motives.

00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:12.784 position:50% align:center
Worry not, sir!

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:14.035 position:50% align:center
Whoo!

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:18.373 position:50% align:center
Ah! Shion?
When did you start drinking?

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:21.084 position:50% align:center
Bwah! Leave it to my lord!

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:23.837 position:50% align:center
He'll have that trade
locked in no time splat!

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.963 position:50% align:center
Ka-boom!

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:26.923 position:50% align:center
Like a trade explosion!

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:28.299 position:50% align:center
--[RIMURU] What?!
--[SHION laughs]

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:30.427 position:50% align:center
'Cause of him,
our food tastes yummy!

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.345 position:50% align:center
Every single meal
on our table is like

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.431 position:50% align:center
an imported feast, y'know?

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:37.350 position:50% align:center
And y'can bet your royal bottom
that more delicious booze

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:40.270 position:50% align:center
like this is gonna be
rolled in by the barrelful!

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:43.106 position:50% align:center
You can trust Lord Rimuru!

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:44.733 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA whimpers]

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:48.111 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
Ah...

[gasps]

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:52.699 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
And safe...

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:54.284 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.661 position:50% align:center
[SHION moans softly]

00:08:56.745 --> 00:08:59.831 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Holy wow, what am
I gonna do with this girl?

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:01.458 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry!

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:04.377 position:50% align:center
Please forgive
my companion's rudeness!

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:06.504 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:07.630 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA]
Hmm...?

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:09.632 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Yeah, sorry about my secretary.

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:13.553 position:50% align:center
It's fine. You should take
her to go get some rest.

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:15.388 position:50% align:center
Right. Please pardon us.

00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:20.435 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA]
How embarrassing.

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.729 position:50% align:center
You can say that again.

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:25.940 position:50% align:center
[SHION chuckles softly]

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:30.445 position:50% align:center
Somehow... I still wanna live up
to her expectations, though.

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:33.823 position:50% align:center
Shuna. Once we're
back in our quarters,

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:35.950 position:50% align:center
let's go over the speech
one more time.

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:37.410 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:43.541 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
The night passed.

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:46.127 position:50% align:center
And the next day, we had a big
rally to publicly announce

00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:49.923 position:50% align:center
the declaration of friendship
between Dwargon and Tempest.

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:51.841 position:50% align:center
Basically, it's an opportunity
to stand before

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:54.636 position:50% align:center
the king's citizens and show
them that we're friends.

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:56.221 position:50% align:center
More or less.

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:58.640 position:50% align:center
My being here doesn't
just represent me,

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:01.184 position:50% align:center
but all of Tempest, as well.

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:03.019 position:50% align:center
It's important that I give
a proper greeting

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:05.188 position:50% align:center
and make a good impression.

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:13.405 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you!

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:14.656 position:50% align:center
Wah!

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:16.408 position:50% align:center
Ahem!

00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:19.077 position:50% align:center
I'm the leader of the Jura
Tempest Federation,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.704 position:50% align:center
or Tempest for short.

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:22.706 position:50% align:center
I'm Rimuru Tempest.

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:26.126 position:50% align:center
[cheering, applause]

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:28.128 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:30.422 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Oh! Thank you so much!

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:35.385 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] So, my biggest wish
is to build a nation

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:36.511 position:50% align:center
that will serve as a bridge

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:40.056 position:50% align:center
between monster
and human society.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.976 position:50% align:center
Dwargon is already a nation in
which monsters and humans

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:48.148 position:50% align:center
both exist and prosper together.
You've already achieved my goal.

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:51.276 position:50% align:center
I couldn't be more grateful to
King Gazel for his endorsement

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:54.362 position:50% align:center
and overall support
of my ideal nation.

00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:56.740 position:50% align:center
I would like to continue
to uphold our relationship

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:59.576 position:50% align:center
of mutual aid, but to do that,
I'm going to need

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.370 position:50% align:center
everyone's cooperation.

00:11:02.454 --> 00:11:05.040 position:50% align:center
In addition to myself,
there are many other monsters

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:07.208 position:50% align:center
who call our country home.

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:11.046 position:50% align:center
It would be fair to say
we're a nation of monsters.

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:13.673 position:50% align:center
But the truth is, in our hearts,
we're no different

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:16.968 position:50% align:center
from any of the citizens here.

00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:20.638 position:50% align:center
I hope that, instead of fearing
us because we're monsters,

00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:23.767 position:50% align:center
you'll accept us
as your new allies.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.270 position:50% align:center
I promise you that my words
convey only my honest feelings.

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:30.982 position:50% align:center
And with that, I'll conclude
my greeting to you.

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:33.485 position:50% align:center
[cheering, applause]

00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:35.612 position:50% align:center
--Lord Rimuru!

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:42.535 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU sighs]

00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:48.041 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Well... I guess
we can call my speech a success!

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:50.460 position:50% align:center
Way too short.
Atrociously humble.

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:54.422 position:50% align:center
Too dependent on their sympathy.
I award you zero points.

00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:55.924 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU groans]

00:11:56.007 --> 00:11:57.342 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL] The ruler of a nation
shouldn't address citizens

00:11:57.425 --> 00:11:58.677 position:50% align:center
with such humility.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.346 position:50% align:center
Especially not the citizens
of a foreign nation.

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.223 position:50% align:center
They'll look down on you.

00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:04.641 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU groans]

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:07.060 position:50% align:center
You cannot rule with such weak
thoughts like, "I hope,"

00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:08.561 position:50% align:center
and, "I wish."

00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:11.147 position:50% align:center
Wonderful things don't come
about by using pretty words.

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:14.359 position:50% align:center
No, you have to make
them come about yourself.

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:15.860 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Right...

00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:18.154 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Man, I totally
sucked at giving speeches

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:19.989 position:50% align:center
back when I was a human, too.

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:21.825 position:50% align:center
Some things never change.

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:25.120 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] But... I don't think
he'd be so honest with me

00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:28.957 position:50% align:center
unless he was sincere
about wanting this to succeed.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.710 position:50% align:center
I really am blessed with
some awesome friendships.

00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:33.378 position:50% align:center
I should thank him.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.841 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Somehow or another,
I managed to make it through

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:41.011 position:50% align:center
my big speech in the
Armed Nation of Dwargon.

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:44.389 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] To celebrate,
I decided to treat myself a bit.

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:47.809 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Yep. When it comes to Dwargon,

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:50.895 position:50% align:center
there's always one place
I make sure to visit!

00:12:52.022 --> 00:12:53.815 position:50% align:center

Butterflies of the Night.

You didn't let Shuna or Shion
see you leave, right?

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:07.495 position:50% align:center
We're good, sir!

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:08.663 position:50% align:center

Follow me.

you'd forgotten about us,

with my human form?

what are you doing?!

that's a rather expensive glass.
