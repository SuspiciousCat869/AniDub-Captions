No, Sir Gabiru...

[laughs]

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.716 position:50% align:center
I have to admit, he's quite
the impressive fighter.

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.593 position:50% align:center
Though I should have expected
that of a dragon descendant.

I was not ignoring you.

In fact, it's the opposite.

I rarely get to use my
techniques on a monster.

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:40.994 position:50% align:center
I was savoring the moment.

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:42.454 position:50% align:center
This is fun for me.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.091 position:50% align:center
Something the matter, Hermes?
You're being forced back.

Is this really the
time for chit-chat?!

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.766 position:50% align:center
[SUPHIA] Damn it. He's really
convinced we're all beneath him!

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.643 position:50% align:center
[SUPHIA] I can't believe that
a guy like you is working

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:07.687 position:50% align:center
for that scumbag, Clayman.

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:09.189 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY]
Hmm?

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:12.567 position:50% align:center
And here, I was positive Yamza
had to be his top fighter.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.654 position:50% align:center
But I see that I should have
trusted my intuition instead.

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:18.490 position:50% align:center
Oh, Yamza, you say?

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:20.992 position:50% align:center
I admit that Yamza is more
than a capable fighter.

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:22.619 position:50% align:center
However, he's not quite
good enough to serve

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.704 position:50% align:center
as my playmate in a match.

00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:26.790 position:50% align:center
I may not look it,
but I've faced off

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.042 position:50% align:center
with Lady Milim many times.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.753 position:50% align:center
Wait, Milim? As in
Demon Lord Milim?

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:35.215 position:50% align:center
That means... you guys must be
part of the Dragon Faithful!

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:36.925 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's right.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:38.301 position:50% align:center
[SUPHIA]
That explains it...

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:39.969 position:50% align:center
I thought your disposition
seemed different from

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.597 position:50% align:center
the rest of the men
in Clayman's army.

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:44.432 position:50% align:center

Hoh! Would you
take a look at that?

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:49.104 position:50% align:center
He actually beat Hermes.

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:51.189 position:50% align:center
Wow, Sir Gabiru managed to win!

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:53.108 position:50% align:center
Just what I'd expect
from our general!

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:55.360 position:50% align:center
You're the coolest,
Sir Gabiru...

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:57.028 position:50% align:center
Truly the best around.

00:03:57.112 --> 00:04:00.907 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Yes, I'm rather
impressed, as well!

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.367 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Father Middray!

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.994 position:50% align:center
You should be helping me
out here, not laughing!

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.914 position:50% align:center
You fool. You lost
fair and square.

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:09.582 position:50% align:center
Plus, I'm not all that worried.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:12.335 position:50% align:center
That Dragonewt seems to have
no interest in killing you.

[GABIRU]
Hmph.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.802 position:50% align:center
Think on your actions,
and use this time to reflect.

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:22.012 position:50% align:center
Now where were we?

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.180 position:50% align:center
Including me, there are
only three of us left.

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:26.599 position:50% align:center
You've put up a rather
good show against my men.

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:28.101 position:50% align:center
And it's easy to see
that your soldiers

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:29.894 position:50% align:center
are very thoroughly trained.

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.855 position:50% align:center
I find it to be
rather interesting.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.815 position:50% align:center
This proves they train
their bodies and minds

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:35.567 position:50% align:center
rather than rely on skills.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.695 position:50% align:center
Well, I suppose I ought to be
pleased by the compliment.

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:40.947 position:50% align:center
Now then, I am Gabiru.

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:42.532 position:50% align:center
Who might you be, good sir?

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:45.452 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY] Hmm. I am
Father Middray, a loyal member

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.704 position:50% align:center
of Lady Milim's Dragon Faithful.

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:51.499 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet ya! I'm Suphia
of the Three Beasketeers.

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:54.252 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't bother to introduce
myself to the likes of Clayman.

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:57.172 position:50% align:center
But a subordinate of Lady
Milim's is a different matter.

00:04:57.255 --> 00:05:00.592 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY] Hmm. So, it's
Gabiru and Suphia, is it?

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:02.093 position:50% align:center
I'll remember that.

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:04.304 position:50% align:center
Now. What shall we do next?

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:07.557 position:50% align:center
If you'd like, I'll be happy to
take on both of you at once.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.560 position:50% align:center
If you don't mind,
can I ask you something?

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.604 position:50% align:center
Oh? Ask away.

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:15.315 position:50% align:center
Well, you see...
I was just wondering...

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:17.400 position:50% align:center
How can a human be so strong?

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:19.611 position:50% align:center
Actually... Now
that I think about it,

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:22.322 position:50% align:center
the Dragon Faithful aren't
even human, are they?

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:24.741 position:50% align:center
Something about you
just feels different.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:26.493 position:50% align:center
You're curious about my race?

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:28.453 position:50% align:center
You might find the answer
quite surprising.

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:30.830 position:50% align:center
But I don't mind
sharing with you.

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:33.291 position:50% align:center
We are what you
would call a Dragonnewt.

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:34.501 position:50% align:center
Just like Gabiru.

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:35.710 position:50% align:center
Like me?!

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:37.754 position:50% align:center
--[gasping]
--He's the coolest...

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:40.965 position:50% align:center
The difference is, we did not
evolve from Lizardmen like you.

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:43.677 position:50% align:center
We're descendants of dragons
that took on human forms

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.679 position:50% align:center
and mated with humans.

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:48.390 position:50% align:center
But in essence, we're
pretty much the same.

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:49.974 position:50% align:center
Oh, now I get it.

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:52.519 position:50% align:center
Actually... Come to think
of it, my sister, Soka,

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:54.813 position:50% align:center
took on the form
of a human, as well.

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:58.024 position:50% align:center
Ah, I thought you seemed
way too strong to be a human.

00:05:58.108 --> 00:06:02.112 position:50% align:center
Yes, however, most of us can no
longer revert to dragon forms.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50% align:center
There are precious few.

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:06.574 position:50% align:center
To be perfectly honest with
you, none of my subordinates

00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:09.911 position:50% align:center
here are capable of assuming
the form of a dragon.

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:11.705 position:50% align:center
It would be fair to
say that, these days,

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:14.541 position:50% align:center
we are no different
from ordinary humans.

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:17.460 position:50% align:center
But we did at least inherit
the dragons' strength.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.796 position:50% align:center
And by professing our
faith to the dragons,

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.881 position:50% align:center
we will never forget
our heritage or the blood

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:23.591 position:50% align:center
that flows in our veins.

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:25.760 position:50% align:center
Was that your only question?
Or is there more?

00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:28.638 position:50% align:center
Nah. You pretty much
just answered everything.

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:30.306 position:50% align:center
All I really wanted to
know was whether or not

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.476 position:50% align:center
you were weak humans that
grew stronger with training.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.021 position:50% align:center
When I asked, you said you
were no different from humans,

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:38.023 position:50% align:center
in which case,
I wanted to show respect

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:40.692 position:50% align:center
for the effort you put in,
if that makes any sense?

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:45.196 position:50% align:center
[laughs] It seems we are
cut from the same cloth!

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.489 position:50% align:center
I'm inclined to agree.

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:47.991 position:50% align:center
There are those
born with strength,

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.368 position:50% align:center
and those who acquire
it through hard work.

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:53.329 position:50% align:center
A mistake that majin make is
that they rely too heavily on

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:54.998 position:50% align:center
the power they were born with.

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.375 position:50% align:center
In those cases, they often
determine their strength

00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:00.420 position:50% align:center
based on how much
energy they possess.

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:02.297 position:50% align:center
True strength is not visible!

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.091 position:50% align:center
You can't just see it by
looking at your opponent!

00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:07.469 position:50% align:center
I understand. And
that makes me happy,

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:09.429 position:50% align:center
because it means
I can get even stronger!

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:13.350 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
That's what I like to hear!

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:16.227 position:50% align:center
Nothing will help you grow
like actual combat.

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:18.229 position:50% align:center
Allow me to be your target.

00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:20.565 position:50% align:center
Come at me when you're ready.

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:22.984 position:50% align:center
You want the two of us
to take you on together?

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:25.820 position:50% align:center
Do you not think that may be
a bit arrogant of you?

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:27.155 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY]
Hmph.

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:30.325 position:50% align:center

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:33.661 position:50% align:center
I say we do it.
He's definitely strong.

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:36.664 position:50% align:center
So, we might as well
acknowledge that.

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:37.999 position:50% align:center

A Beastketeer indeed!

I'm a little surprised to see
that we're evenly matched.

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:12.409 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately for you, this has
only solidified my victory!

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:13.868 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:16.454 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA] Hmph! Did you think
the only ace up my sleeve

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:20.417 position:50% align:center
was this magic sword? You have
proven that you are strong.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.921 position:50% align:center
On equal footing with me, even.
I can acknowledge that.

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:28.883 position:50% align:center
However, what would you do if
there were suddenly two of me?

Whoa, that seems really unfair!

00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:45.025 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA, DOPPELGANGER] Now then,
if you surrender to me,

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:46.943 position:50% align:center
then I will graciously
spare your life--

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:49.696 position:50% align:center

I expected more from a majin
under the command of Clayman.

to keep up your sleeve.

You have my permission to take
the others and retreat, Gobta.

00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:23.188 position:50% align:center
Okay then, you don't
gotta tell me twice!

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:24.647 position:50% align:center

I outmatch you.
Just surrender already.

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:00.892 position:50% align:center
You'll be our prisoner,
but at least you won't die.

If things keep going
at this rate,

00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:24.040 position:50% align:center
then I won't be able
to push back

00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:26.334 position:50% align:center
or fight against her at all!

00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:27.794 position:50% align:center
I don't get it.

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:30.547 position:50% align:center
How are the Three
Beastketeers so powerful?

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:33.800 position:50% align:center
Fine! I will surrender!

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:35.385 position:50% align:center
And I accept your offer!

I don't remember having it.

Please don't!

No! Spare me, sir!
I don't want to do this!

everyone as soon as possible!

This is terrible,
Father Middray.

00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:48.518 position:50% align:center
This presence, whatever it is,
it's quite formidable.

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:50.478 position:50% align:center
Yes, I already know.

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:54.941 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY] As I thought. It's
Charybdis, the legendary foe

00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:57.527 position:50% align:center
Lady Milim
recently defeated.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.654 position:50% align:center
You mean the monster that
inhabited Phobio's body

00:12:59.738 --> 00:13:01.072 position:50% align:center
to come back to life?

00:13:01.156 --> 00:13:03.533 position:50% align:center
Didn't Demon Lord Milim
obliterate that thing, though?!

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:06.369 position:50% align:center
Yes. There's no doubt
she destroyed it.

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:08.955 position:50% align:center
You're right.
It's not the real one.

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:11.499 position:50% align:center
Whatever that is has
a fragment of its power.

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:14.753 position:50% align:center
Yeah, true.
It seems to be unstable.

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:16.880 position:50% align:center
So, if we just leave it be,
it should die on its own

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:18.506 position:50% align:center
within a day or two.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.633 position:50% align:center
No. This is a battlefield.

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:22.594 position:50% align:center
If something goes wrong,
it could evolve in a way

00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:24.512 position:50% align:center
that we may not expect.

00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:27.098 position:50% align:center
When it comes to a monster
like that, it's best to give it

00:13:27.182 --> 00:13:29.476 position:50% align:center
as little food as possible.

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:32.520 position:50% align:center
Oh. You're healing us, too?

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:33.521 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:13:33.605 --> 00:13:35.523 position:50% align:center
You are truly kind.

00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:36.816 position:50% align:center

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:48.119 position:50% align:center
[ALBIS] Those who can flee using
transport magic may be fine.

00:13:48.203 --> 00:13:49.746 position:50% align:center
But those who can't...

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:51.581 position:50% align:center
...will all die!

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:55.669 position:50% align:center
Despicable! Curse that
evil bastard, Clayman!

00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:00.048 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY]
I see. It looks like...

00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:03.176 position:50% align:center
...it's using Yamza as
a sort of substitute core.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:05.929 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'd say that's
a pretty fair assessment.

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:08.014 position:50% align:center
You know, I was kind of hoping
that I'd have the chance

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:09.933 position:50% align:center
to kill that jerk myself.

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:13.061 position:50% align:center
But it seems that his soul
has already been devoured.

00:14:13.144 --> 00:14:16.356 position:50% align:center
So, at this point, all we can
really do is minimize the damage

00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:18.274 position:50% align:center
while we wait
for him to die off.

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:19.526 position:50% align:center
You hear that?

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:21.695 position:50% align:center
You're permitted
to arm yourselves.

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:23.113 position:50% align:center
But don't get greedy.

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:24.906 position:50% align:center
If we only need
to buy some time,

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:26.282 position:50% align:center
then we can make it work.

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:27.826 position:50% align:center
[GABIRU]
Father Middray!

00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:29.994 position:50% align:center
Please allow us
to be of use, as well.

00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:31.705 position:50% align:center
We've fought that thing before.

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:33.873 position:50% align:center
If you can avoid being
attacked by its scales,

00:14:33.957 --> 00:14:35.291 position:50% align:center
then you won't be injured.

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:36.543 position:50% align:center
It's true.

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:38.962 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'll help everyone
pull back, too.

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:41.089 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY]
Okay. Then let's get moving!

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:42.340 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Right!

[CHARYBDIS roars]

00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:50.890 position:50% align:center
Damn it! All I can do is help
the other soldiers escape.

00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:52.892 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] This is a violation
of orders, Albis.

00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:57.230 position:50% align:center

to withdraw if you couldn't win?

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:06.031 position:50% align:center
Sir Benimaru...?

00:15:12.162 --> 00:15:16.291 position:50% align:center
[gasps] He cut it, and
Black Flame is preventing it

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:18.543 position:50% align:center
from regenerating?

[ALBIS whimpers]

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.756 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] Charybdis... You
present the perfect opportunity

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:25.008 position:50% align:center
to test my new power.

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:26.760 position:50% align:center
But we're short on time,

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:29.679 position:50% align:center
so I'll end this.

00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:32.223 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. If you were
in your complete state,

00:15:32.307 --> 00:15:34.142 position:50% align:center
I would've loved
to play with you.

Begone! Go Hell Flare!

00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:53.912 position:50% align:center
Ah... There's no way...

00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:56.581 position:50% align:center
Albis. I have
business to attend to.

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:58.833 position:50% align:center
As of this moment, you will
assume command of all troops

00:15:58.917 --> 00:16:00.085 position:50% align:center
as my aide.

00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:03.088 position:50% align:center
Right. It would be my pleasure.
Thank you, sir.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.592 position:50% align:center
Impossible! How?

00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:10.512 position:50% align:center
How did he manage to defeat it
without even breaking a sweat?

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:13.473 position:50% align:center
Who the heck is he?
A Demon Lord?

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.308 position:50% align:center
Lady Milim is one thing,

00:16:15.392 --> 00:16:18.520 position:50% align:center
but how can a normal majin have
such a terrifying ability?

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:20.230 position:50% align:center
He has to be
some kind of monster.

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:22.482 position:50% align:center
You mean, Sir Benimaru?

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:26.111 position:50% align:center
Hold up, what's going on?
What did you guys see out there?

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:29.906 position:50% align:center
Uh, well. I'll do my best
to explain it to you.

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:33.785 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY sighs] No, it appears
that won't be necessary.

00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:44.546 position:50% align:center
Hey. I hear you've been
entertaining some of my men.

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:47.048 position:50% align:center
Whoa. He's scary.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.302 position:50% align:center

Hmm...

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:52.929 position:50% align:center

Wait a second, Sir Benimaru!

00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:54.180 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Hmm?

00:16:54.264 --> 00:16:56.307 position:50% align:center
These people are
subordinates of Lady Milim!

00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:58.643 position:50% align:center
And not just any subordinates,
they're warrior priests

--[SUPHIA] Mm-hmm!

00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:06.359 position:50% align:center
Yes! In fact, they were even
kind enough to heal our wounds

00:17:06.443 --> 00:17:08.403 position:50% align:center
with their healing magic
before you got here!

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:09.988 position:50% align:center
Right! We're all good as new!

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:11.865 position:50% align:center
Yes, there's no need to worry!

00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:15.410 position:50% align:center
I understand. It's possible
I was a bit overzealous.

00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:17.120 position:50% align:center
It's just that you seem
like the biggest challenge

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:20.373 position:50% align:center
on this battlefield.
So I was instantly wary of you.

00:17:20.457 --> 00:17:22.292 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:24.627 position:50% align:center
Please, you weren't
being overzealous at all!

00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:26.546 position:50% align:center
And to be perfectly
honest with you,

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:28.840 position:50% align:center
I only healed their injuries
in preparations for

00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:30.342 position:50% align:center
a much greater disaster!

00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:34.763 position:50% align:center
I see. So what's next for us?
Are you wanting to spar?

00:17:34.846 --> 00:17:37.182 position:50% align:center
Yes. Good question.

00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:39.392 position:50% align:center
I'm not entirely sure
what we should do.

00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:41.770 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] As for us, we would
much prefer not stir up

00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:44.689 position:50% align:center
any trouble with
Lady Milim's people.

00:17:44.773 --> 00:17:46.775 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY]
Hmm. Fair enough.

00:17:46.858 --> 00:17:48.902 position:50% align:center
While I always enjoy
an exciting fight,

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:51.988 position:50% align:center
that doesn't mean I want
an all-out war or anything.

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:53.907 position:50% align:center
My only real desire
is to find out

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.700 position:50% align:center
which of us here is stronger.

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:56.785 position:50% align:center
[HERMES]
Ah?!

00:17:56.868 --> 00:17:58.661 position:50% align:center
Well, I can relate
to that sentiment.

00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:00.372 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasping]

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.833 position:50% align:center
[HERMES]
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:06.753 position:50% align:center
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That is a terrible idea!

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:08.797 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Please, Sir Benimaru!

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.924 position:50% align:center
Who knows what
disasters will befall us?!

00:18:11.007 --> 00:18:13.343 position:50% align:center
Especially if we harm
Lady Milim's warriors!

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:16.221 position:50% align:center
And Lord Rimuru is Lady Milim's
dearest friend, remember?!

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:18.848 position:50% align:center
You two fighting would be
a horrific tragedy for sure!

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:21.017 position:50% align:center
--Yes, I already know that!
--Yes, I know, you fool!

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:26.940 position:50% align:center
If I don't fight to kill,
then I'd probably just lose.

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:29.484 position:50% align:center
I'm not one to engage
in losing battles.

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:31.695 position:50% align:center
Yes. Good point.

00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:36.366 position:50% align:center
After seeing the power you
wielded against Charbydis,

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:37.992 position:50% align:center
I sincerely doubt
I could survive

00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:39.494 position:50% align:center
a similar attack from you!

00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:42.872 position:50% align:center
--[laughs]
--[chuckles]

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:46.376 position:50% align:center
[BOTH sigh]

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:49.170 position:50% align:center
[FOOTMAN]
Ooh-hoo-hoo! What a plot twist!

00:18:49.254 --> 00:18:51.339 position:50% align:center
Not Yamza's betrayal--
that was expected.

00:18:51.423 --> 00:18:55.260 position:50% align:center
But the part where Charybdis
fell so easily was surprising!

00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:56.594 position:50% align:center
[TEAR]
I know!

00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:59.472 position:50% align:center
Even we can't take on
that devastatin' creature!

00:18:59.556 --> 00:19:01.641 position:50% align:center
[FOOTMAN] Clayman's forces
were annihilated!

00:19:01.725 --> 00:19:03.309 position:50% align:center
The plan has failed.

00:19:03.393 --> 00:19:05.520 position:50% align:center
The losses suffered here
are far too great.

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:08.273 position:50% align:center
He really should have done as
he said and sat there quietly

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:10.525 position:50% align:center
and played nice like
a good little boy.

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:14.362 position:50% align:center
[TEAR] I know! Laplace even
warned him about this!

00:19:14.446 --> 00:19:17.699 position:50% align:center
Clayman has no one
but himself to blame!

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:19.367 position:50% align:center
[FOOTMAN]
On that note...

00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:21.578 position:50% align:center
--[PHOBIO panting]
--[GELD huffing]

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.872 position:50% align:center
[FOOTMAN] We need to report
this turn of events to him,

00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:27.000 position:50% align:center
so we'll have to end
our little game early.

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:30.920 position:50% align:center
[PHOBIO]
No! You're not getting away!

00:19:31.004 --> 00:19:33.298 position:50% align:center
I knew you clowns were bad news.

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:38.345 position:50% align:center
[PHOBIO]
If I can just keep you here,

00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:42.140 position:50% align:center
then Albis and Suphia
should be along soon enough.

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:44.392 position:50% align:center
Sir Benimaru will
be with them, too.

00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:45.852 position:50% align:center
Your time is up.

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:47.562 position:50% align:center
[TEAR]
Enough with all the yowlin',

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:48.980 position:50% align:center
you silly little cat!

00:19:49.064 --> 00:19:50.440 position:50% align:center
[PHOBIO groans]

00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:57.614 position:50% align:center
[PHOBIO retches]

00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:07.290 position:50% align:center
[GELD grunts]

00:20:11.586 --> 00:20:12.796 position:50% align:center
[GELD gasps]

00:20:19.344 --> 00:20:22.472 position:50% align:center
[GELD groaning]

00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:26.184 position:50% align:center
Hey! Hang in there, Geld!

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:31.481 position:50% align:center
[GELD groaning]

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:33.274 position:50% align:center
Raugh!

00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:37.737 position:50% align:center
[GELD huffing]

00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
[FOOTMAN laughs] Sad to say, we
have not been asked to eliminate

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:46.705 position:50% align:center
the two of you this time. So we
shall let you leave here alive.

00:20:48.206 --> 00:20:49.416 position:50% align:center
[TEAR]
You'd better be grateful!

00:20:49.499 --> 00:20:51.167 position:50% align:center
'Cause if we were
really serious,

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:54.295 position:50% align:center
we'd be talkin' to a couple
of corpses by now!

00:20:59.426 --> 00:21:02.554 position:50% align:center
[GELD huffs]
They bested us.

00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:05.432 position:50% align:center
I did gain more power,
but I suppose there's

00:21:05.515 --> 00:21:07.308 position:50% align:center
always someone stronger.

00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:10.020 position:50% align:center
[PHOBIO]
No. If you hadn't been here,

00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:12.522 position:50% align:center
I'd probably be dead.

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:15.066 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for holding
you back, Geld.

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.485 position:50% align:center
Please, you did no such thing.

00:21:17.569 --> 00:21:21.239 position:50% align:center
We may have lost this bout,
but at least we have our lives.

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:24.075 position:50% align:center
As long as we win
next time, it's fine.

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center
Yes, you're right.
I'm looking forward to it.

00:21:30.415 --> 00:21:32.000 position:50% align:center
[GELD]
Sir Benimaru,

00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:33.585 position:50% align:center
the clowns have escaped.

00:21:33.668 --> 00:21:35.128 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
I know.

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:37.547 position:50% align:center
And they probably thought that
they were sparing our lives.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.883 position:50% align:center
Hmph. How naïve.

00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:42.010 position:50% align:center
[GABIRU] Don't be rough
with the prisoners!

00:21:42.093 --> 00:21:44.429 position:50% align:center
If any are injured,
please treat them!

00:21:45.722 --> 00:21:48.641 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Geld, you kept Phobio safe,

00:21:48.725 --> 00:21:50.852 position:50% align:center
and you revealed
the enemy's hand.

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:52.937 position:50% align:center
I thank you.

00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:54.689 position:50% align:center
Because of your efforts,

00:21:54.773 --> 00:21:58.026 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru will analyze
the secret to their strength,

00:21:58.109 --> 00:22:00.653 position:50% align:center
and they will be
exposed to the world.

00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:05.825 position:50% align:center
I'd hoped to settle
the score here on this land

00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:07.160 position:50% align:center
where it all started.

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:10.163 position:50% align:center
But unfortunately,
it was just not meant to be.

00:22:10.246 --> 00:22:12.749 position:50% align:center
I will not lose again.

00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:17.253 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
With that said, I am exhausted.

00:22:19.506 --> 00:22:21.341 position:50% align:center
[PHOBIO]
Me, too...

00:23:54.184 --> 00:23:57.187 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Next time,
"Adalmann, the Index Finger."
