[CHLOE sobbing]

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:06.126 align:middle
[KENYA]
Chloe! You're such a crybaby!

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:07.419 align:middle
Cut it out!

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:08.878 align:middle
You're crying, too, Ken!

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.423 align:middle
Nuh-uh, I'm sweating
from my eyeballs!

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:12.966 align:middle
[CHLOE]
Don't leave...

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.634 align:middle
Stay here...

[sobbing]

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:21.808 align:middle
I can't. But it'll be okay.

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:24.060 align:middle
[RIMURU] What if I give
you this mask to keep?

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle
[gasping]

00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:28.398 align:middle
I wanted him to give me that!

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:29.733 align:middle
But he gave it to me!

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.276 align:middle
Man, lucky!

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.944 align:middle
That's not fair!

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:35.447 align:middle
[RIMURU] Relax, I have
gifts for you guys, too.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.489 align:middle
[gasping]

00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:37.949 align:middle
[RIMURU chuckles]

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:41.786 align:middle
Whoa! Heh!

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.413 align:middle
Aw, man, you look awesome!

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:44.914 align:middle
Yeah, so do you!

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.958 align:middle
These robes are amazing.

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:49.210 align:middle
We look so cute!

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:52.339 align:middle
My friend Shuna's really good
at sewing clothes and stuff,

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:54.424 align:middle
so she made these just for you.

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:55.425 align:middle
That's cool!

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:56.843 align:middle
Thanks so much!

00:02:56.926 --> 00:03:00.055 align:middle
[RIMURU] Listen up.
No slacking off on your studies!

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:01.556 align:middle
This isn't really goodbye.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.642 align:middle
I'm sure we'll
all meet again someday.

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:07.228 align:middle
Ranga and I can
visit in our free time.

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:09.356 align:middle
[RANGA] Be sure to dedicate
yourselves to studying,

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.774 align:middle
even after we're gone.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:13.485 align:middle
Fine. But you'd better not
forget to come and see us.

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:15.737 align:middle
Also... Maybe after
we all graduate,

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.031 align:middle
we can come visit you
in your country!

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:19.866 align:middle
Sure. Sounds good.

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.703 align:middle
I know everyone in my city will
welcome you with open arms.

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:30.126 align:middle
--See ya!
--Safe travels!

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.754 align:middle
--We'll see you later!
--Take care now!

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:34.964 align:middle
Take care, kids!

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:42.430 align:middle
Goodbye...

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:49.938 align:middle
[RANGA] Master, why did you
give Chloe your special mask?

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:53.566 align:middle
Oh. To be honest,
I'm not really sure.

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:58.988 align:middle
It sounds kinda weird.
I know. But in the end,

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:02.867 align:middle
giving the mask to Chloe felt
like the natural thing to do.

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:05.286 align:middle
And I think it was for the best.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.621 align:middle
[RANGA]
I see.

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:08.248 align:middle
[RIMURU] I bet if Shizu
could have chosen,

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:11.418 align:middle
she would have preferred that
Chloe had it over me, anyway.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:14.212 align:middle
Plus, I'm sure she'll
take good care of it.

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:16.715 align:middle
Maybe Chloe will follow
in Shizu's footsteps!

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:19.843 align:middle
She could grow up to be a
Champion, or maybe even a Hero!

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:21.469 align:middle
[RANGA]
Perhaps!

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:23.722 align:middle
[RIMURU, RANGA laugh]

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:24.848 align:middle
Ranga?

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.683 align:middle
[RANGA]
What is it, Master?

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.644 align:middle
I'm ready to go home.
To our town.

00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:31.646 align:middle
Everyone's waiting!

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:45.035 align:middle
[RIMURU] Cool. I think
we're far enough out.

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:48.580 align:middle
Let's use Spatial Movement
and poof back to Tempest!

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:49.789 align:middle
[RANGA]
Okay!

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle
I'm sure everyone is
eagerly waiting for you!

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:53.543 align:middle
Even I'm excited!

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:56.504 align:middle
[RIMURU] What? But you've
been with me the whole time.

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.715 align:middle
[gasps, whimpers]

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:00.216 align:middle
[RANGA]
Master?

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:03.970 align:middle
[RIMURU]
I sense something.

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:09.434 align:middle
[RANGA]
Same here.

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:11.144 align:middle
Ranga. Get into my shadow.

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:12.896 align:middle
Right!

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:22.906 align:middle
--[GREAT SAGE] Notice.
--What's wrong, Great Sage?

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.200 align:middle
[GREAT SAGE] You're enclosed
within a wide-range barrier.

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:26.701 align:middle
For real?

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:28.203 align:middle
[GREAT SAGE]
All spatial interference skills

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:30.205 align:middle
that would permit
an exit are sealed.

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:32.624 align:middle
Spatial Movement cannot be used.

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:35.710 align:middle

I doubt that's good.

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:43.802 align:middle
[SOUEI grunts]
Please listen.

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:44.844 align:middle
You must flee.

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:46.846 align:middle
[gasps]
What happened to you?

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.890 align:middle
Enemies. A lot...

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:51.101 align:middle
They are dangerous--

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:52.852 align:middle
Wait, Souei!

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:56.064 align:middle
[RIMURU]
I don't get it.

00:05:56.147 --> 00:05:57.816 align:middle
What's going on?

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:59.901 align:middle
[gasps]
Ranga!

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:03.154 align:middle

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:06.074 align:middle
--[GREAT SAGE] Notice.
--[RIMURU] More bad news?

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:07.283 align:middle
[GREAT SAGE]
You have been enclosed within

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:09.160 align:middle
another wide-range barrier.

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:11.204 align:middle
[RIMURU]
There're two? Overkill, much?

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:13.623 align:middle
[GREAT SAGE] The latest barrier
prevents the use of skills.

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:15.333 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Use Resist!

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.213 align:middle
[GREAT SAGE]
Resist successful.

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:24.384 align:middle
However, the use of magic skills
will be extremely limited.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:26.469 align:middle
Seriously?

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:29.222 align:middle
[RIMURU] Not good. If the person
who put up these barriers

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:31.266 align:middle
is out there, Souei and
the others would have

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.101 align:middle
definitely noticed.

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:35.395 align:middle
I bet the forcefield trapped
me before they could use

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:38.940 align:middle
Thought Communication
to warn me about any danger.

00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:42.485 align:middle
Which would mean the user
is targeting me, specifically.

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:45.447 align:middle
[RIMURU] If that's the case,
what are they after?

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.116 align:middle
I'm getting some
serious murder vibes here.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:51.411 align:middle
They sealed all my abilities
before even starting the fight.

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:53.163 align:middle
I'm screwed.

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.373 align:middle
This won't be
your standard battle.

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:59.127 align:middle
It must be a pro who's
used to fighting monsters.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.587 align:middle
[gasps]

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.847 align:middle
I would say hello. Except...

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.641 align:middle
This is technically
more of a goodbye.

00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:15.060 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Nice opener.

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:17.645 align:middle
She must be
pretty damn confident.

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:19.397 align:middle
The Holy Knights.

00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:23.985 align:middle
Guardians of law and order,
and the enemies of monsters.

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:25.945 align:middle
[RIMURU] What's up?
I don't believe we've met!

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:27.697 align:middle
Can I help you with something?

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:30.116 align:middle
Honestly, I think you've
got the wrong guy.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.119 align:middle
You're very polite.
Nicer than most monsters.

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:34.788 align:middle
Rimuru Tempest.

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:36.414 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Crap on a stick.

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:39.250 align:middle
Yeah, sorry, but what makes
you think I'm a monster?

00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:42.837 align:middle
Just look at me!
A normal, boring, adventurer!

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:45.507 align:middle
[HINATA] Don't play dumb.
I received an anonymous tip.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.509 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Uh. Say what?

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:51.304 align:middle
[HINATA] There are eyes all over
the Kingdom of Ingrassia.

00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:54.099 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Eyes? I don't get it.

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:56.059 align:middle
Who sold me out?

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:59.104 align:middle
Your city's in my way.
Not for long.

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.064 align:middle
Since I intend to destroy it.

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:02.482 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Come again?

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:04.192 align:middle
[HINATA] Allowing you to
return there now would be

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:08.488 align:middle
a huge inconvenience to me.
Am I making myself clear?

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:10.240 align:middle
[RIMURU]
You want to destroy Tempest?

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:13.326 align:middle
No, you've already
attacked, haven't you?

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.413 align:middle
Well... Someone has.

I swear, you must
be part cockroach.

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:45.275 align:middle
Disgusting.

concern you, Gramps,

speak to your elders?

Yeah. I'll live, anyway.

He's moving slowly.

I think something's
really wrong.

He can't use full strength.

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:35.283 align:middle

It must make monsters weaker.

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:38.870 align:middle

[SHION grunts]

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:40.015 align:middle
Hah. You may be weakened,
but you're still giving me

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:41.474 align:middle
a good run for my money.

00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:43.184 align:middle
Shut up, lech!

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:45.437 align:middle
[grunting]

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.647 align:middle
[SHOGO chuckles]

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:52.360 align:middle
[SHOGO laughing]

[KIDS wailing]

00:10:57.991 --> 00:10:59.617 align:middle
Don't worry, kids.

00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:01.870 align:middle
No matter what happens,
I will keep you all safe.

00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:03.747 align:middle
[sobbing continues]

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.291 align:middle
[LIZARDMAN 10H]
It's okay. Stop crying.

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:09.586 align:middle
There, now you can't see.
Nothing to be scared of.

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.172 align:middle
Lady Shion will make
the bad guys go away.

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:14.716 align:middle
She's an incredibly
strong warrior.

00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:21.181 align:middle
[SHION whimpering]

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:22.223 align:middle
Now, die!

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:24.100 align:middle
[SHION gasps, growls]

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:25.727 align:middle
[SHOGO grunts]

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle
Time's up.

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:43.953 align:middle
Hurry! We're being
attacked by monsters!

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:45.246 align:middle
You have to help us!

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.247 align:middle
[SHION gasps]

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:47.749 align:middle
[SHOGO laughs]

00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:51.378 align:middle
[gasps]

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:55.090 align:middle
[whimpering]

00:11:55.173 --> 00:11:57.550 align:middle
I come to see the "friendly"
monster land I heard of

00:11:57.634 --> 00:12:00.804 align:middle
and find this? We won't
stand for such savagery!

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:01.805 align:middle
Watch out!

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:03.640 align:middle
You're breaking human laws!

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:06.059 align:middle
Therefore, the Knights
of Falmuth have come here

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:07.894 align:middle
to assist you!

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:09.062 align:middle
[GOBLIN GIRL 30A whimpers]

00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:10.605 align:middle
[SHION panting]

[SOLDIERS yelling]

00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:18.863 align:middle
[FOLGEN yells]

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:27.288 align:middle
--[shrieking, wailing]
--[slashing, thudding]

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:37.757 align:middle
[RIMURU] Tell me why
you want to destroy Tempest.

00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:40.051 align:middle
Who's behind this, and why?

00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:42.804 align:middle
[HINATA]
Hmph. I'm tired of this drivel.

00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:47.058 align:middle
Straight to business.

00:12:47.142 --> 00:12:50.895 align:middle
Before we start fighting, could
you at least tell me your name?

00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:54.149 align:middle
You're a monster, yet you
concern yourself with names?

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:58.778 align:middle
Such things mean little to me,
so I admit it slipped my mind.

00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:00.363 align:middle
But, since you insist,

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:04.075 align:middle
I serve as the right hand of God
in the Holy Empire of Ruberios.

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:06.494 align:middle
My title is Chief Knight
of the Imperial Guard

00:13:06.578 --> 00:13:08.496 align:middle
and Captain of the Holy Knights.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.666 align:middle
If you need a name--
Hinata Sakaguchi.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.460 align:middle
Not that you're going
to be around long enough

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:14.586 align:middle
for it to matter.

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:16.546 align:middle
You're Hinata? No way.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:18.381 align:middle
But that means...

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:20.216 align:middle
I heard you were
Captain of the Holy Knights,

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.551 align:middle
but I didn't know
you're Chief Knight

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.887 align:middle
of the Imperial Guard, too.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.638 align:middle
[HINATA]
I see you're well-informed.

00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:28.892 align:middle
Though I don't love that
monsters know who I am.

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:30.685 align:middle
It is true that
I hold two titles,

00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:32.270 align:middle
though they mean nothing.

00:13:32.354 --> 00:13:33.855 align:middle
What's important...

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:36.274 align:middle
...is that I serve
the God Luminous.

00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:38.526 align:middle
Not that mortal emperor.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.487 align:middle
Hey, wait, don't be hasty!

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.655 align:middle
There's something
I wanted to talk to you about!

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:45.325 align:middle
[HINATA] I don't care
about a monster's words!

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:49.120 align:middle
[RIMURU gasps]
Whoa! I said wait!

00:13:49.204 --> 00:13:52.665 align:middle
You actually evaded that?
Color me surprised.

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:55.293 align:middle
I no longer have any doubt
that you killed Shizu.

00:13:55.377 --> 00:13:57.128 align:middle
And now, I'm going
to avenge her.

00:13:57.212 --> 00:14:00.215 align:middle
Look, just hear me out!
You are from Japan, aren't you?

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:02.092 align:middle
I'm Japanese, too!

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.301 align:middle
You are?

00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:05.512 align:middle
[RIMURU] Yes! And Shizu
personally asked me

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:06.513 align:middle
to help you!

00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:08.181 align:middle
[HINATA]
She asked you for a favor?

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:09.307 align:middle
Are you serious?

00:14:09.391 --> 00:14:11.267 align:middle
Yeah. She was really
worried about you,

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:12.936 align:middle
that's how I know who you are!

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:15.355 align:middle
What a ridiculous
thing to tell me.

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:16.898 align:middle
I don't see the humor.

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:20.485 align:middle
[RIMURU grunts] You've gotta
believe me, I'm from Japan!

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:22.779 align:middle
I was stabbed to death,
then reincarnated here

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:24.406 align:middle
as a slime monster!

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:27.617 align:middle
My intel told me that you'd
insist you were Japanese.

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:29.577 align:middle
But it's pointless
to keep up that act.

00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:30.995 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Intel?

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:33.873 align:middle
So her informant is somebody
who knows I'm Japanese?

00:14:33.957 --> 00:14:35.583 align:middle
Who is it?

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:37.127 align:middle
[RIMURU grunts]

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:42.549 align:middle
You still insist
on fighting me, huh?

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:44.217 align:middle
All by yourself?

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.593 align:middle
Okay, then.

00:14:45.677 --> 00:14:48.847 align:middle
[HINATA] Laugh if you must.
You think you can win?

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.765 align:middle
Within this barrier?

00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:04.988 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Seriously?!

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:12.412 align:middle
[RIMURU grunts] Pain
Nullification isn't working?

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:14.372 align:middle
What's happening?!

00:15:14.456 --> 00:15:16.624 align:middle
[HINATA]
Hmm? Only three attacks?

00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:19.169 align:middle
Well, perhaps
I underestimated you.

00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:20.712 align:middle
[RIMURU grunts]

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:30.722 align:middle
[RIMURU] I might be in trouble
if I take any more hits.

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:32.223 align:middle
[HINATA]
What's the matter?

00:15:32.307 --> 00:15:34.809 align:middle
Have you realized what makes
this technique so dangerous?

00:15:34.893 --> 00:15:36.811 align:middle
I guess you do have
some intelligence.

00:15:36.895 --> 00:15:38.438 align:middle
[RIMURU]
I appreciate the compliment,

00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:40.065 align:middle
but I'd like it even more
if you'd just stop

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:41.524 align:middle
and listen to me.

00:15:41.608 --> 00:15:43.610 align:middle
[GREAT SAGE] Notice.
Her technique does not appear

00:15:43.693 --> 00:15:46.780 align:middle
to directly affect the
physical body of its target.

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:49.908 align:middle
Instead, it strikes
at the spiritual body.

00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:52.535 align:middle
[RIMURU] The attack works
directly on the spirit?

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:54.454 align:middle
How much more can I withstand?

00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:57.415 align:middle
[GREAT SAGE] Answer:
Three more hits will kill you.

00:15:57.499 --> 00:16:00.126 align:middle
[RIMURU] If I take three more
of those things, I'm dead?

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:03.088 align:middle
Man, maybe I was the one
who underestimated her.

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:06.299 align:middle
So... What should I do?

00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:08.009 align:middle
[HINATA]
There's no way out of this.

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:09.761 align:middle
You are cornered, slime.

00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:12.722 align:middle
The Holy Field skill is the
ultimate anti-monster barrier

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:15.725 align:middle
and the pride of the
Western Holy Church.

00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:17.811 align:middle
You mean it traps
monsters inside

00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:19.938 align:middle
and then they're weakened by it?

00:16:20.021 --> 00:16:23.316 align:middle
Magicules are purified
within this particular barrier.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.735 align:middle
So even a high-level monster
such as yourself will lose

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:29.489 align:middle
most of their strength just
trying to keep themselves alive.

00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:32.534 align:middle
Because you can't utilize
your natural abilities.

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:34.786 align:middle
Yeah, don't think
I haven't figured that out.

00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:38.373 align:middle
Earlier, you seemed displeased
that I was your only opponent,

00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:41.876 align:middle
but normally, I would give such
a menial task to someone else.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.629 align:middle
There's only one reason
I took it on...

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.593 align:middle
[RIMURU gasps]

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:52.721 align:middle
[RIMURU]
One strike left...

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:55.932 align:middle
I accepted it because you
are the one who killed Shizu.

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:58.935 align:middle
[RIMURU grunts]
It's not what you think!

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:01.604 align:middle
That's enough. I will kill you.

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:03.815 align:middle
It's the only way to avenge her.

00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:05.275 align:middle
You're not wrong.

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:08.069 align:middle
Technically, I was the one
who ended her, but, please--

00:17:08.153 --> 00:17:09.696 align:middle
"Technically"?

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:12.615 align:middle
Shizu is dead and that's
the result that matters.

00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:13.950 align:middle
It's your fault.

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:16.953 align:middle
You killed the only person
here who was kind to me.

00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:20.498 align:middle
[SHIZU]
If you ever lose your way.

00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:22.959 align:middle
I want you to rely on me.

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:28.340 align:middle
And now... I'm all alone.

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:29.758 align:middle
She's gone...

00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:32.677 align:middle
I admit I don't
understand this emotion.

00:17:36.514 --> 00:17:39.267 align:middle
[RIMURU] Who could have told
Hinata that Shizu was dead?

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:41.478 align:middle
Whoever it was certainly went
out of their way to paint me

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:43.605 align:middle
as the villain of the story.

00:17:45.023 --> 00:17:46.358 align:middle
[HINATA]
Worried about your friends?

00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:47.692 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Of course!

00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:50.111 align:middle
[HINATA] I'm sure.
After all, if you take too long,

00:17:50.195 --> 00:17:53.365 align:middle
you'll have no way
to return home.

00:17:53.448 --> 00:17:55.784 align:middle
Not that I have any
intention of letting you.

00:17:55.867 --> 00:17:57.118 align:middle
[RIMURU]
I think it's a bit too soon

00:17:57.202 --> 00:17:59.579 align:middle
to declare your own victory!

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:01.289 align:middle
[RIMURU] I'll strike
using "Steel Strength"

00:18:01.373 --> 00:18:03.249 align:middle
and "Strengthen Body!"

00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:11.800 align:middle
[gasps]

00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:13.635 align:middle
[RIMURU] She's observing
my attacks and modifying

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:16.846 align:middle
her own defenses in
anticipation of my strikes!

00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:20.183 align:middle
[RIMURU] This is tough,
it almost feels like

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:23.061 align:middle
I'm trying to fight
against Great Sage.

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:37.242 align:middle
[RIMURU]
This isn't working.

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:39.536 align:middle
She's too freakin' strong!

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:40.704 align:middle
That was close.

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:42.330 align:middle
It's impressive that
you can move so well

00:18:42.414 --> 00:18:44.207 align:middle
inside this barrier.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.710 align:middle
Frankly, I had sold you short.

00:18:46.793 --> 00:18:49.838 align:middle
Still... You won't
leave here alive.

00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:52.757 align:middle
Because you can kill me
with just one more strike?

00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:55.552 align:middle
Oh? So you know?

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:59.305 align:middle
[HINATA] This sword is infused
with a special ability known as

00:18:59.389 --> 00:19:01.016 align:middle
Dead End Rainbow.

00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:02.976 align:middle
And it guarantees that
my opponent will die

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:05.770 align:middle
on the seventh hit.

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:10.316 align:middle
Understand? It can kill
even spiritual beings.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.943 align:middle
You have fought well,
but it's easy to see

00:19:12.027 --> 00:19:13.319 align:middle
you've had enough.

00:19:13.403 --> 00:19:15.822 align:middle
[RIMURU] Hmph. Yeah,
I definitely wasn't expecting

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:18.074 align:middle
a fight that I had
no hope of winning.

00:19:18.158 --> 00:19:21.327 align:middle
Regardless, I will keep
fighting, even if it's in vain.

00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:23.496 align:middle
I may be a slime,
but I'm not so soft

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.498 align:middle
that I'd just roll over and die!

00:19:25.582 --> 00:19:28.209 align:middle
[GREAT SAGE] Notice. Using
the unique skill "Degenerate,"

00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:31.087 align:middle
the higher-level elemental known
as Ifrit has been separated

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:32.714 align:middle
into a pure spirit.

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:35.592 align:middle
[RIMURU]
All right! Defeat my enemy!

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:38.094 align:middle
Superior spirit of fire, Ifrit!

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:40.889 align:middle
[roars]

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:51.941 align:middle
[gasps]

00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:57.906 align:middle
I never would have imagined that
you employ a superior spirit.

00:19:57.989 --> 00:20:01.743 align:middle
Nice try. But it's still not
enough to grant you a victory.

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:03.411 align:middle
[gasps]

00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:05.830 align:middle
[IFRIT groans]

00:20:05.914 --> 00:20:06.998 align:middle
[RIMURU gasps]

00:20:07.082 --> 00:20:08.375 align:middle
[roars]

00:20:08.458 --> 00:20:09.959 align:middle
[RIMURU]
What did you do to him?!

00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:11.503 align:middle
Quick, come back to me!

00:20:11.586 --> 00:20:13.004 align:middle
[gasps]

00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:18.134 align:middle
[RIMURU grunts]
What just happened?

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:20.929 align:middle
[GREAT SAGE]
Answer.

00:20:21.012 --> 00:20:23.682 align:middle
Ifrit has suffered the effects
of Compulsory Usurpation.

00:20:23.765 --> 00:20:25.558 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Compulsory Usurpation?

00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:28.978 align:middle
Are you saying she can steal
her opponents' abilities?

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:31.064 align:middle
Is that Hinata's unique skill?

00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:33.274 align:middle
[GREAT SAGE] Because there was
a magic circuit between you,

00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:35.694 align:middle
it can be assumed
that Ifrit was not stolen.

00:20:35.777 --> 00:20:39.030 align:middle
[RIMURU growls]
Hinata Sakaguchi...

00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:42.992 align:middle
She's a beast, far exceeding
all my expectations.

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:45.203 align:middle
Did you try to
steal Ifrit from me?

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:48.915 align:middle
Guilty as charged.
I'm surprised you knew.

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:50.041 align:middle
No matter.

00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:53.628 align:middle
To confirm, yes,
it was my Unique Skill.

00:20:53.712 --> 00:20:55.588 align:middle
Known as "Usurper."

00:20:55.672 --> 00:20:57.173 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Usurper?

00:20:57.257 --> 00:21:01.052 align:middle
I wonder if it's like
my Gluttony skill.

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:04.723 align:middle
Gluttony? Yeah, that's it.

00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:08.226 align:middle
[RIMURU sighs]

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:10.478 align:middle
[RIMURU] Looks like it's time
to make a decision.

00:21:10.562 --> 00:21:13.314 align:middle
If she strikes me
one more time, I lose.

00:21:13.398 --> 00:21:16.067 align:middle
I have to use my last resort.

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:18.903 align:middle
Hinata.

00:21:21.114 --> 00:21:23.825 align:middle
[RIMURU] Shizu sent me to help
you and the other kids here,

00:21:23.908 --> 00:21:26.244 align:middle
but I can't waste any
more time on you.

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:28.788 align:middle
There's just too much at stake.

00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:32.083 align:middle
Sorry, but I can't
keep holding back.

00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:33.668 align:middle
It's time to finish this.

00:21:33.752 --> 00:21:35.003 align:middle
Heh. Well.

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:37.213 align:middle
I appreciate the warning,
but it's unnecessary.

00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:39.883 align:middle
I'll have to get serious, too.

00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:41.259 align:middle
I hope you're ready.

00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:43.094 align:middle
This attack will inflict pain
on you like nothing

00:21:43.178 --> 00:21:46.222 align:middle
you've ever experienced,
but that's what you deserve.

00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:47.724 align:middle
[RIMURU growls]

00:21:57.192 --> 00:21:58.276 align:middle
[HINATA]
It's over!

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.403 align:middle
Dead End Rainbow!

00:22:00.487 --> 00:22:03.323 align:middle
[RIMURU]
Awaken: Gluttony!

00:22:03.406 --> 00:22:05.450 align:middle
[GREAT SAGE]
Complete. Order accepted.

00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:08.161 align:middle
Executing immediately.

00:22:08.244 --> 00:22:12.207 align:middle
[RIMURU] The moment I gave that
order, my consciousness faded.

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:15.377 align:middle
Like I was sinking
into oblivion.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.587 align:middle
Then I lost it entirely.

00:22:17.671 --> 00:22:21.841 align:middle
I plummeted into darkness,
as if I were asleep.

00:23:54.434 --> 00:23:56.311 align:middle
[GREAT SAGE]
Next time, "Despair."
