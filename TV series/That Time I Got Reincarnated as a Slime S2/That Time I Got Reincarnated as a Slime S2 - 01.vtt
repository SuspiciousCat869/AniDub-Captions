[RIMURU]
Alice Rondo.

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:23.982 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Here!

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:25.650 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Chloe Aubert.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:27.152 position:50% align:center
[CHLOE]
Here.

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:29.195 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Good, everyone's present.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.865 position:50% align:center
Now, as you may recall,
I'll be leaving Freedom Academy

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:34.784 position:50% align:center
at the end of the current term.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:35.785 position:50% align:center
We know.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.454 position:50% align:center
[ALICE groans]

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.456 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
No need to look so glum, chums.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.708 position:50% align:center
I promise to
come back and visit.

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:43.543 position:50% align:center
Don't waste your time.

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:44.878 position:50% align:center
Who cares?

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:46.546 position:50% align:center
It's not like we're gonna
miss you or anything.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.173 position:50% align:center
What's with the tough act?

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:50.467 position:50% align:center
Is it painful to be
honest with yourself?

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.676 position:50% align:center
Do you promise?

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.803 position:50% align:center
You'll really come
visit us again?

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.305 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Yeah! You bet.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.182 position:50% align:center
But we can hold off on the
goodbyes since we've still got

00:00:57.265 --> 00:00:58.641 position:50% align:center
a month left.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:01.478 position:50% align:center
More importantly, you guys
have finals coming up soon,

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:04.314 position:50% align:center
so I expect you to start hitting
those books, got it?

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:06.024 position:50% align:center
Really? Finals are the worst.

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:07.650 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.819 position:50% align:center
[TISS]
Professor Rimuru? It's me.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:13.239 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Oh, Professor Tiss
is here to teach her class.

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:17.077 position:50% align:center
Come on in!

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.662 position:50% align:center
You kids better not make any
trouble for Professor Tiss,

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.206 position:50% align:center
--y'hear me?
--No worries.

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:22.832 position:50% align:center
We'll be good for her.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.584 position:50% align:center
Yeah, no prob, we really
got to know each other

00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:26.419 position:50% align:center
on our journey to Guratol.

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:29.506 position:50% align:center
Thanks to that trip,
we're all pretty tight now.

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:32.175 position:50% align:center
That's true.
They're wonderful kids.

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:34.719 position:50% align:center
You think so, huh? Uh...

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:37.931 position:50% align:center
[KIDS chuckling]

00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:39.683 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Eh... Well, in that case,

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.434 position:50% align:center
I'll leave them in your
capable hands.

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:42.477 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.063 position:50% align:center
So what are you
gonna go do, teach?

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:46.856 position:50% align:center
Probably take a nap
or something.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.400 position:50% align:center
Shows what you know.

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:52.320 position:50% align:center
As it turns out, I actually
happen to be pretty busy, Alice.

00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:54.322 position:50% align:center
See you later!

00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:57.325 position:50% align:center
I've got this. Have a good one!

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:58.576 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.036 position:50% align:center
--[CHLOE] Have fun!
--[TISS] All right.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.830 position:50% align:center
--[RYOTA] See you tomorrow.
--Let's talk about finals.

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:03.790 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Good riddance!

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.876 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Seems Professor Tiss
is getting along well

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.044 position:50% align:center
with the kids.

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:09.838 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Yes.

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:12.090 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] She can take over
for me after I leave.

00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:13.466 position:50% align:center
That's good.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.926 position:50% align:center
Now then.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.224 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I wasn't lying about being busy.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:24.352 position:50% align:center
Not only do I have the kids of
Freedom Academy to look after,

00:02:24.436 --> 00:02:26.604 position:50% align:center
but I've also got my "hands"
full with stuff to do

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:30.358 position:50% align:center
for Tempest, our
nation of monsters.

00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:33.153 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, I got a new skill
called "Spatial Movement"

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:35.071 position:50% align:center
by studying one of
the air spirits,

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:39.325 position:50% align:center
which will make my slife
a whole lot easier.

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.828 position:50% align:center
Check it out, Ranga,
looks like another peaceful day

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:44.914 position:50% align:center
in the country of Tempest.

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.916 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I'm Rimuru Tempest.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.918 position:50% align:center
I also happen to be a slime.

00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:52.881 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Back when I was a human,

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:55.675 position:50% align:center
I got stabbed by a total rando
and kicked it right there

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.093 position:50% align:center
on the sidewalk.

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:04.976 position:50% align:center
But then I got reincarnated
into this world as a slime.

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:17.405 position:50% align:center
I became friends with
the Storm Dragon, Veldora.

00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:30.001 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I founded
a new nation for monsters.

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:43.556 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] And I fought
to protect everyone in it.

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:54.275 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Shizu's last wish...

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:09.040 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
...was to save those kids.

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:11.209 position:50% align:center
With a little help
from some spirits...

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:18.008 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] ...we were
able to save them all.

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:29.102 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] My time as a teacher
is almost over.

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:30.729 position:50% align:center
There sure have been
a lot of ups and downs

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:33.398 position:50% align:center
on this crazy journey of mine.

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:36.192 position:50% align:center
Things haven't
always been easy, but...

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.694 position:50% align:center
It's all worth it.

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:40.613 position:50% align:center
Because now we can
finally enjoy a little peace.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.803 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] So, a while back,
I got into a bit of a mess

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:28.388 position:50% align:center
with Demon Lord Carrion.

00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:31.141 position:50% align:center
Thankfully, we agreed to sign
a non-aggression pact.

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:33.351 position:50% align:center
Then I accepted
Carrion's proposal.

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:35.645 position:50% align:center
He suggested that the
Jura Tempest Federation

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.731 position:50% align:center
and the Animal Kingdom
of Eurazania should each

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:40.233 position:50% align:center
send out delegations
to the other country.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:44.029 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I appointed Benimaru
to lead our delegation,

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:46.072 position:50% align:center
with Rigur as his assistant.

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:49.325 position:50% align:center
[RIGURD sobs]
He looks so grown up!

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:52.829 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] The delegation
is scheduled to leave today,

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:56.166 position:50% align:center
and it's a super
momentous occasion.

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:59.669 position:50% align:center
Which is why I had to pop back
to Tempest to see everyone off.

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:06.885 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU sighs]
Yep. Not bad.

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:12.515 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU groans]
Hoo boy.

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:15.101 position:50% align:center
This shape's
a little tougher to hold.

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:17.145 position:50% align:center
[SHION] Lord Rimuru,
thank you for waiting!

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:18.521 position:50% align:center
Waugh!

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:20.565 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA] We've selected
a variety of ceremonial outfits

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:22.192 position:50% align:center
for today's big meeting.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.943 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Oh, thanks a lot!

00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:26.154 position:50% align:center
I guess I'll go ahead
and try them on.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.875 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] This might
actually be a bit much.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.545 position:50% align:center
Well, perhaps you'd
prefer this one instead.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:46.216 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] It, uh, still seems
a little over the top.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.593 position:50% align:center
I recommend this one,
Lord Rimuru!

00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:49.969 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU grunts]

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:54.140 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
You look fantastic!

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:55.642 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA]
It suits you wonderfully!

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:58.186 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU sighs] Listen,
I appreciate the effort.

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:02.357 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] But I think we
need something that reflects

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.276 position:50% align:center
the occasion a bit
more appropriately.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.154 position:50% align:center
Are the outfits we selected
inappropriate?

00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:09.739 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
This delegation is important to

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:11.574 position:50% align:center
the future of Tempest.

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:14.369 position:50% align:center
I want to
send them off properly.

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:16.079 position:50% align:center
I get it!

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:19.791 position:50% align:center
Yes, say no more. I have the
perfect outfit for you!

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:28.341 position:50% align:center
Hey. It's starting!

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:33.888 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:37.100 position:50% align:center
You look amazing, sir!

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:39.019 position:50% align:center
Don't you think, Gobzo?

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:40.020 position:50% align:center
[GOBZO]
Mm.

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:41.396 position:50% align:center
Wow. He's so cool!

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:43.523 position:50% align:center
Yeah, just like you, Sir Gabiru!

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:45.108 position:50% align:center
--It's true!
--You're both great.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.652 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] Those clothes
suit you nicely, Master!

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:49.070 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
Enough with the compliments!

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:52.365 position:50% align:center
[gasping, shushing]

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:01.541 position:50% align:center
Well, then.

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
I wish you all the best
on your diplomatic mission.

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:06.588 position:50% align:center
[wind whooshing]

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:10.759 position:50% align:center
Is that it, my lord?

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:13.261 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Was that not enough?!

00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:14.554 position:50% align:center
Ahem.

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:16.431 position:50% align:center
That was just my opener.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.685 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] While Tempest has
grown vastly more prosperous

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:22.145 position:50% align:center
than it was before,

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:25.315 position:50% align:center
it's still inexperienced
as a nation.

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:28.318 position:50% align:center
If we can build a favorable
relationship with Eurazania,

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.278 position:50% align:center
we can find ways to utilize
the things that make

00:09:30.362 --> 00:09:32.906 position:50% align:center
their nation great, which
will help our own country

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:35.158 position:50% align:center
progress even further.

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:38.328 position:50% align:center
However, their ruler,
Demon Lord Carrion,

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:43.208 position:50% align:center
also known as the Beastmaster,
is a hardcore military dude.

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:46.836 position:50% align:center
He might even be like,
"Power is everything, bruh!"

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.174 position:50% align:center
If he tries to start something,
then you come back here.

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:53.009 position:50% align:center
Our goal is not to fight.

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:55.428 position:50% align:center
It's to find out if our
nations can get along,

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:58.515 position:50% align:center
or see if it would be better
to sever relations with them.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.475 position:50% align:center
This is for the good of
Tempest, but you don't need

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:03.687 position:50% align:center
to force yourself to endure
any great hardships.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.063 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you!

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:06.314 position:50% align:center
[DELEGATES]
Right!

00:10:06.398 --> 00:10:09.234 position:50% align:center
[cheering]

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:11.236 position:50% align:center
It was such an eloquent speech!

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:13.863 position:50% align:center
His sagacious words
have reduced me to tears!

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:15.156 position:50% align:center
[LIZARDMAN 10G]
Uh...

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.826 position:50% align:center
[RIGURD whimpering]

00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:19.369 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Honestly,
I feel like I should be

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:20.995 position:50% align:center
the one going out there.

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:23.498 position:50% align:center
No. Until we confirm it's safe,

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:25.375 position:50% align:center
I believe it's better that
you stay away from

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:26.876 position:50% align:center
the other Demon Lords.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.128 position:50% align:center
Leave it to me.

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:30.463 position:50% align:center
I shall discern if Lord Carrion
can be trusted,

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:31.798 position:50% align:center
then report back here.

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:33.425 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Thanks. Still though.

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:36.052 position:50% align:center
Try not to go and pick
any fights, y'hear me?

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:37.512 position:50% align:center
There's no need to worry.

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:41.725 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] So mature! Benimaru
really is a reliable guy.

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:43.518 position:50% align:center
And good luck
to you, too, Rigur.

00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:45.895 position:50% align:center
Thanks. I'll learn
as much as I can, sir.

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:50.066 position:50% align:center
Right, we're leaving.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.403 position:50% align:center
[TOWNSFOLK cheering]

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:58.742 position:50% align:center
Make us proud, everybody!

00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:00.285 position:50% align:center
Be careful on your journey!

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:01.953 position:50% align:center
[LIZARDMEN]
Good luck in Eurazania!

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:04.914 position:50% align:center
Farewell, Brother!
Please come back safely!

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:06.166 position:50% align:center
[GABIRU]
We'll miss you guys!

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:08.001 position:50% align:center
This feels like a really
good step for Tempest.

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:09.210 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:10.920 position:50% align:center
Here's hoping
we can establish formal

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:13.214 position:50% align:center
diplomatic relations
and help both of our nations

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:14.924 position:50% align:center
grow even stronger.

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:19.137 position:50% align:center
Thus, our first group
of delegates set off

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.057 position:50% align:center
on their journey.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.434 position:50% align:center
In town, we had our own
things to get ready for

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.102 position:50% align:center
in order to welcome
the delegates that would be

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.146 position:50% align:center
arriving from Eurazania.

00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:31.024 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Nice work!

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:33.568 position:50% align:center
Looks like the guest house
will be ready in time.

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.487 position:50% align:center
How's the training
with the chefs?

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.740 position:50% align:center
It's great. Princess Shuna
has been working with them.

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:42.243 position:50% align:center
They're all quick learners and
everything is coming along well.

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:47.040 position:50% align:center
It's very tasty, but I think it
could use just a bit more salt.

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:49.459 position:50% align:center
[SHION] The reception hall
wait staff are ready to go.

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.753 position:50% align:center
Thanks to some additional
guidance from Vesta.

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:54.130 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I guess proper
etiquette is kind of his forte.

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:56.257 position:50% align:center
It's nice to have
an actual noble around.

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:58.802 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
Let's see... What else?

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:00.929 position:50% align:center
The date for your visit to
the Armed Nation of Dwargon

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:02.347 position:50% align:center
has been set.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:03.890 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Right...

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:06.142 position:50% align:center
I need to meet King Gazel in
person to officially thank him

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:09.562 position:50% align:center
for establishing diplomatic
relations with Tempest.

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:11.856 position:50% align:center
He's probably not too happy
with Milim's involvement

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.358 position:50% align:center
in the Charybdis incident,

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:16.361 position:50% align:center
so I guess I should
explain that, too.

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:17.654 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:20.490 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Treyni!

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:25.036 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru. Hello.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.747 position:50% align:center
If you're here,
is something the matter?

00:12:27.831 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50% align:center
No, I simply wanted to inform
you that the delegation from

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:33.670 position:50% align:center
the Animal Kingdom of Eurazania
has entered the domain.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:35.005 position:50% align:center
That's why I've come.

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:36.715 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Ah, they're close?

00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:38.216 position:50% align:center
Well, you could say that.

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:40.927 position:50% align:center
They should be here within
a couple of days at the latest.

00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:42.929 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Sweet, thanks for the heads up!

00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:45.390 position:50% align:center
[TREYNI] Of course,
it was the least I could do.

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:47.934 position:50% align:center
Also, I feel I should warn you
that the other party will arrive

00:12:48.018 --> 00:12:49.978 position:50% align:center
before the delegates do.

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:51.604 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Other party?

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:54.065 position:50% align:center
[TREYNI]
Yes. The Champions.

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:59.029 position:50% align:center
[GIRL humming]

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:01.865 position:50% align:center
It's getting dark.
Let's head back.

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:02.866 position:50% align:center
'Kay!

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:05.368 position:50% align:center
[leaves rustling]

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:07.746 position:50% align:center
[MUSHROOM 25A]
Mush, mush, mush.

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:09.706 position:50% align:center
Mush!

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:12.000 position:50% align:center
[GIRL]
How cute!

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:15.337 position:50% align:center
[MUSHROOM 25A snarls]

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.505 position:50% align:center
[shrieks]

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:18.882 position:50% align:center
[YOUM]
Don't move!

00:13:19.883 --> 00:13:21.301 position:50% align:center
[YOUM grunts]

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:27.724 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
It was Youm and his party.

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:30.810 position:50% align:center
See, they used to be a gang of
ruffians, but then I had them

00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:32.771 position:50% align:center
become the champions
who defeated the Orc Lord

00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:34.314 position:50% align:center
in our place.

00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:37.150 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Oh, wow.

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:38.818 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] If it got out that a
bunch of monsters defeated

00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:42.322 position:50% align:center
the Orc Lord, it would just
make humans wary of us.

00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:43.573 position:50% align:center
Are the two of you all right?

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:46.868 position:50% align:center
Yes, I think so,
thank you for asking.

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:49.412 position:50% align:center
Uh, sir? Thanks for your help.

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:50.622 position:50% align:center
You should be more careful--

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:52.749 position:50% align:center
these woods can
be quite dangerous.

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:55.085 position:50% align:center
Um. I like your sword!

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:59.381 position:50% align:center
[YOUM] Thanks, kid. Y'know, I
actually had it made near here,

00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:02.092 position:50% align:center
in the nation of monsters
known as Tempest.

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:04.135 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] He and his party are
traveling around and spreading

00:14:04.219 --> 00:14:05.887 position:50% align:center
the good name of Tempest.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.556 position:50% align:center
That way everyone knows
we're friendly monsters.

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:17.107 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.692 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
No doubt about it.

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:24.531 position:50% align:center
[GOBTA panting]

00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:26.991 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:37.919 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:14:38.003 --> 00:14:41.131 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] With everything
goin' on, I was one busy slime.

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:43.216 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.311 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] And I would be
right up until we welcomed

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:58.106 position:50% align:center
the delegates from Eurazania.

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:04.404 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, this
tastes pretty good.

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:05.947 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you can say that again.

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:07.490 position:50% align:center
What'd you say this
stuff was called?

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:08.616 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.536 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Oh, that? It's called "brandy."

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:13.621 position:50% align:center
[YOUM]
"Brandy"? I like it.

00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:14.873 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I made it as a special treat

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:16.583 position:50% align:center
since we have guests visiting.

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:19.169 position:50% align:center
That's interesting. What kind?

00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:21.629 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Well. The Demon Lord
Carrion's delegation

00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:23.340 position:50% align:center
is arriving tomorrow.

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.509 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
How'd you do that in sync?!

00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:29.387 position:50% align:center
[coughs] How'd you
end up playing host

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:31.848 position:50% align:center
to Demon Lord Carrion's people?!

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:36.061 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
It's kind of a long story...

00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:38.938 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA sighs]
This feels so nice.

00:15:40.607 --> 00:15:42.275 position:50% align:center
[SHION sighs]

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:46.237 position:50% align:center
Whoa, are you serious?

00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:49.032 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Yep. Just tryin'
to be diplomatic.

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:52.952 position:50% align:center
It makes sense.
But still, a Demon Lord?

00:15:53.036 --> 00:15:55.789 position:50% align:center
I imagine whoever
he sends will be real scary.

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:57.165 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Maybe, who knows?

00:15:57.248 --> 00:15:59.501 position:50% align:center
I'm hoping things
will go smoothly.

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:01.753 position:50% align:center
[YOUM] Wait, didn't you send
Benimaru with your guys

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:03.421 position:50% align:center
in case things got hairy?

00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:06.758 position:50% align:center
I bet you anything their people
are doing the same thing.

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:08.927 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] That wouldn't
surprise me in the least.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.387 position:50% align:center
I don't want to ruin
a good opportunity

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.055 position:50% align:center
with violence, though.

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:14.099 position:50% align:center
Well, that's
a fair enough point.

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:16.810 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Make sure
you guys don't pick any fights

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:18.061 position:50% align:center
with them, either.

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:20.105 position:50% align:center
You don't have to talk
to us like we're idiots.

00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:21.815 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not, we're
actually pretty smart

00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:23.858 position:50% align:center
most of the time!
Aren't we?

00:16:23.942 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
You said it, boss.

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:26.569 position:50% align:center
[hiccups]

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:28.613 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Not related.
When you get the chance,

00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:30.657 position:50% align:center
Hakurou was hoping to see you.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.367 position:50% align:center
[YOUM grunts]
The master?

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.745 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] He wants to make sure
you haven't gotten rusty.

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:37.997 position:50% align:center
Suddenly, I'm feeling
really sober.

00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:40.125 position:50% align:center
[whining]

00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:45.046 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
And so, the big day arrived.

00:16:54.723 --> 00:16:56.224 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Here they come.

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:06.484 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:08.194 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Horse-drawn carriages?

00:17:08.278 --> 00:17:10.488 position:50% align:center
No wait, those are
real friggin' tigers!

00:17:10.572 --> 00:17:12.323 position:50% align:center
Talk about an entrance.

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:13.950 position:50% align:center
Oh, please, it's no big deal.

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:16.369 position:50% align:center
Compared to your power,
some tiger-drawn war chariot

00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:18.121 position:50% align:center
hardly even works as a bluff.

00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:19.456 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I beg to differ!

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:21.499 position:50% align:center
Tigers seem like
a big deal to me!

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:23.626 position:50% align:center
Not to mention those fancy
decorations would serve

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.670 position:50% align:center
no purpose in an actual battle.

00:17:25.754 --> 00:17:27.130 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Back up the truck, Shion!

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:29.674 position:50% align:center
We're not talking
about battles, remember?

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:42.896 position:50% align:center
[ALBIS]
It is a pleasure to meet you.

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:45.732 position:50% align:center
You must be the leader of
the Jura Tempest Federation.

00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:47.359 position:50% align:center
Rimuru, I presume?

00:17:49.611 --> 00:17:52.447 position:50% align:center
I am known as Albis,
the Golden Serpent.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.117 position:50% align:center
I'm also one of Demon Lord
Carrion's Three Beastketeers.

00:17:57.202 --> 00:17:58.453 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Whoa...

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:00.497 position:50% align:center
The dude sent his highest
ranking subordinates?

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.498 position:50% align:center
[SUPHIA]
This a joke?

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:03.041 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:04.959 position:50% align:center
[SUPHIA] I only came on this
dumb trip 'cause I wanted to see

00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:07.379 position:50% align:center
who the monster
leader of Tempest was.

00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:09.673 position:50% align:center
And it turns out it's
a pathetic ball of slime?

00:18:09.756 --> 00:18:12.050 position:50% align:center
Are you guys just screwin'
with us or somethin'?

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.054 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Wow... Rest in peace,
carriage door.

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:17.681 position:50% align:center
[ALBIS]
That's enough, Suphia.

00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:19.849 position:50% align:center
If you don't watch your mouth,
you're going to embarrass

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:22.560 position:50% align:center
Lord Carrion with
your reckless opinions.

00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:24.187 position:50% align:center
Who cares what you think?

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.064 position:50% align:center
You can't order me around.

00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:28.650 position:50% align:center
Plus, hanging with
Dwarves is one thing.

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:30.443 position:50% align:center
But humans, too?

00:18:30.527 --> 00:18:33.488 position:50% align:center
Anyone who pals around with
puny, insolent, cowardly humans

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:36.074 position:50% align:center
is a disgrace
to monsters everywhere!

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:37.242 position:50% align:center
[growling]

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:40.161 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU growls]
That's quite the hot take.

00:18:40.245 --> 00:18:42.288 position:50% align:center
Youm here happens
to be my friend.

00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:45.250 position:50% align:center
We're also both students
of the same master.

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:47.043 position:50% align:center
You act like I care.

00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:50.005 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Hey, Youm.

00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:52.424 position:50% align:center
Doesn't it bug you that
she just wrote you guys off?

00:18:52.507 --> 00:18:53.717 position:50% align:center
[YOUM]
Huh?

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.926 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Why don't you
show her what you can do?

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.970 position:50% align:center
I'll allow it this one time.

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:58.221 position:50% align:center
Hold on a second!

00:18:58.304 --> 00:19:00.515 position:50% align:center
Last night, you were all
about peace and stuff!

00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:02.559 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] It's true that I wasn't
looking to start a fight,

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:06.646 position:50% align:center
but if they're itching for one,
then it's no slime off my back.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.816 position:50% align:center
Oh? You wanna play, human?

00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
I dunno.

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:15.280 position:50% align:center
[KAJIR] Go get her, boss!
Show her what you can do!

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:17.824 position:50% align:center
You're not a loser!
We believe in you!

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:19.200 position:50% align:center
Demonstrate your power!

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:22.037 position:50% align:center
[YOUM sighs]

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.747 position:50% align:center
All right, fine.

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:29.919 position:50% align:center
Master. Just clean up
the mess I leave behind.

00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:32.964 position:50% align:center
Hah! So you're making
the slime clean up after you?

00:19:33.048 --> 00:19:34.341 position:50% align:center
Guess that makes sense.

00:19:34.424 --> 00:19:37.302 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Sure, whatever you say... pal?

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:39.721 position:50% align:center
Wait? What's happening?

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:41.556 position:50% align:center
I just can't take it anymore.

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:44.976 position:50% align:center
All this girl has done
is hurl insults at you.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.562 position:50% align:center
Until now, I have
exercised great patience.

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:50.106 position:50% align:center
But it would seem that's
no longer necessary.

00:19:52.067 --> 00:19:53.610 position:50% align:center
[YOUM]
Hmm?

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:55.195 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hey!

00:19:55.278 --> 00:19:57.155 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
You'll be fighting me instead.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.202 position:50% align:center
I see. Think you can
take me hand-to-hand?

00:20:02.285 --> 00:20:03.953 position:50% align:center
Then bring it on.

00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:06.122 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
Hmm.

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:09.501 position:50% align:center
[SUPHIA grunting]

00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:11.336 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Heh!

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:12.462 position:50% align:center
[SHION grunts]

00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:16.174 position:50% align:center
[SUPHIA grunting]

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:18.760 position:50% align:center
[grunting, groaning]

00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:28.895 position:50% align:center
[SUPHIA]
Heh.

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:29.979 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
Hah!

00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:35.527 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Uh, should
I be worried about Shion?

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.863 position:50% align:center
She's fighting on her opponent's
terms, without her giant sword.

00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:41.408 position:50% align:center
There's no need for concern,
Lord Rimuru.

00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:44.494 position:50% align:center
Honestly, Shion is almost
as strong as my big brother.

00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:46.246 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Oh. Word.

00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:51.084 position:50% align:center
My, sometimes there's
just no containing Suphia.

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:52.585 position:50% align:center
--Grucius.
--[GRUCIUS] Huh?

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:55.005 position:50% align:center
[ALBIS] Looks like you'll have
to take care of the human.

00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:56.214 position:50% align:center
What?

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:57.549 position:50% align:center
So just because
I'm the runt of the brigade,

00:20:57.632 --> 00:20:59.342 position:50% align:center
I have to do the fighting?

00:20:59.426 --> 00:21:01.219 position:50% align:center
This is turning out
to be a pain.

00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:05.557 position:50% align:center
[GRUCIUS grunts]

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:09.102 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
All right, human.

00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:10.520 position:50% align:center
Let's do this.

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:11.813 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sure.

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:13.231 position:50% align:center
Come at me.

00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:15.483 position:50% align:center
Ahh...!

00:21:15.567 --> 00:21:16.776 position:50% align:center
[GRUCIUS grunts]

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:25.285 position:50% align:center
[BOTH chuckle]

00:21:25.368 --> 00:21:27.537 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Man, Youm's pretty legit.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.457 position:50% align:center
Grucius is a majin, and he's
managing to hold his own.

00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:34.127 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA] Yes. He's
fighting magnificently.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:37.464 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] It looks like Hakurou's
training is really paying off!

00:21:37.547 --> 00:21:39.341 position:50% align:center
Boss man's doin'
great out there!

00:21:39.424 --> 00:21:41.384 position:50% align:center
Guess that's a champion for ya!

00:21:42.719 --> 00:21:44.512 position:50% align:center
[SUPHIA grunts]

00:21:44.596 --> 00:21:48.391 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Wow, I wasn't expecting
you to be this much fun!

00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:50.852 position:50% align:center
Huh. Don't underestimate me.

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:53.605 position:50% align:center
A Kijin's power can
breach the heavens.

00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:55.982 position:50% align:center
and shatter the ground.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.736 position:50% align:center
Allow me to demonstrate!

00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:02.864 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
Sounds good, bring it on!

00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:04.866 position:50% align:center
You're actually
pretty entertaining!

00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:08.912 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunting]

00:22:08.995 --> 00:22:11.581 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] That's how,
immediately after the delegation

00:22:11.664 --> 00:22:15.835 position:50% align:center
from Eurazania arrived,
a ferocious battle broke out.

00:22:19.089 --> 00:22:21.633 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Of course, I was
the one who instigated it.

00:23:53.892 --> 00:23:56.978 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE] Next time,
"Trade with the Animal Kingdom."
