a fool out of me!

[RAPHAEL] Notice: there is
a distinct possibility

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:42.334 position:50% align:center
that Clayman is
thinking of fleeing.

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:44.210 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I figured.

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:46.004 position:50% align:center
Look, it's already over for you.

00:00:46.087 --> 00:00:47.380 position:50% align:center
So just surrender peacefully

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:49.466 position:50% align:center
and tell me who's been
giving you orders.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.844 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN] There is truly
no end to your insolence!

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:55.013 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN] Fool! The moment
you dodge that...

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:56.806 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] He's planning
to make it blow up in midair

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.184 position:50% align:center
and use it as a chance to run.

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:01.686 position:50% align:center

warn you it was already over.

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:14.783 position:50% align:center
[GUY] Hmm? I see,
he stole my barrier technique.

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.785 position:50% align:center
He's very brazen for a slime.

[RIMURU]
Hey.

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.957 position:50% align:center
Do you think you could
take this seriously?

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:24.250 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN gasps]

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:26.544 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:28.755 position:50% align:center
You are indeed
a strong opponent.

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:30.757 position:50% align:center
I will give you that much.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.843 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately for you,
I've only just begun to show you

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.846 position:50% align:center
what I'm capable of!

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.810 position:50% align:center
I doubt even you will be able
to withstand this attack!

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:45.689 position:50% align:center
Behold! This is
my ultimate technique!

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:48.983 position:50% align:center
Demon Blaster!

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:51.194 position:50% align:center
Swallow it up! Beelzebub!

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:04.416 position:50% align:center
No way! That shouldn't
even be possible!

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:07.210 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.
That was my ultimate attack!

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:08.503 position:50% align:center
How'd you stop it?!

00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:10.130 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
It's no use, Clayman.

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:12.132 position:50% align:center
You're obviously
outmatched here.

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:14.968 position:50% align:center
If you give up quietly, and tell
me everything that you know,

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:17.387 position:50% align:center
then I promise to give you
a painless death.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.097 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN laughs]

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.224 position:50% align:center
Yes, except I am a Deathman!

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:24.144 position:50% align:center
Even if you do kill me,
I will simply come back to life.

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:25.145 position:50% align:center
Sooner or later--

--Raugh!
--Ah!

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:41.870 position:50% align:center
Looks like he used Thought
Acceleration on Clayman.

00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:43.788 position:50% align:center
Well, I can't
blame him for that.

00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:45.874 position:50% align:center
It's the punishment
that Clayman deserves.

--[CLAYMAN gasps]
--I'll ask you one more time.

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.305 position:50% align:center
Who gave you orders?

00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:01.931 position:50% align:center
Do not mock me.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.059 position:50% align:center
I'd never betray a friend.

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:07.937 position:50% align:center
What's more, I'd never sell out
the identity of a client.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.105 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.941 position:50% align:center
That is absolute!
The one rule we honor

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.444 position:50% align:center
in the Moderate
Harlequin Alliance!

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:17.739 position:50% align:center
I see. I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:19.449 position:50% align:center
but you won't be
coming back to life.

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.910 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN gasps]
Say what?

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:23.495 position:50% align:center
You're a Deathman, right?

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:25.872 position:50% align:center
So, I know you're planning to
separate from your astral body

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:28.208 position:50% align:center
and escape. Am I wrong?

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:29.459 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN gasps]
Wait!

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.795 position:50% align:center
Looks like Clayman
is unwilling to cooperate.

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:33.505 position:50% align:center
I'm going to execute him.

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.298 position:50% align:center

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:37.467 position:50% align:center

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.761 position:50% align:center
If so, I'll take them on.

--[GUY] No, have at it.
--[CLAYMAN] Huh?!

The brief moment you'll have
before your soul dies

00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:58.738 position:50% align:center
will feel like an eternity.

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:01.199 position:50% align:center
Use that time to think
about what you've done.

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:02.867 position:50% align:center
Just spare me!

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:04.202 position:50% align:center

Laplace...

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:29.894 position:50% align:center
You were right all along...

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:33.314 position:50% align:center
It would seem
I went too far this time.

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:35.650 position:50% align:center
I should have just listened
to the advice you gave me

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
and been more careful...

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:42.198 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
Truly, you were always right...

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:58.381 position:50% align:center

Well done.

00:04:58.465 --> 00:04:59.966 position:50% align:center

you are officially acknowledged

you'll find some other sucker

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.647 position:50% align:center
for the job.

care who becomes a Demon Lord.

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:44.427 position:50% align:center

her real identity!

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.667 position:50% align:center

was the real Demon Lord.

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.341 position:50% align:center
to continue concealing it.

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:05.342 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:06.968 position:50% align:center
What's with the angry glare?

00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:09.220 position:50% align:center
It's not like
I knew it was a secret.

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:10.513 position:50% align:center
Also, it was "Luminus."
So close...

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:13.016 position:50% align:center
What's more, I'm curious
about something.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.143 position:50% align:center
When Clayman looked
at you earlier, he froze,

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:17.062 position:50% align:center
if only for a mere moment.

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:18.605 position:50% align:center
[ROY]
Uh?

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:20.940 position:50% align:center
I suspect he may be involved
with the insect who was lurking

00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:22.692 position:50% align:center
in my domain recently.

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
When you return, tell everyone
to strengthen security.

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:27.030 position:50% align:center
[ROY]
Understood.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.243 position:50% align:center
[LEON] Ah, I knew the name
"Kazalim" sounded familiar.

00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:34.496 position:50% align:center
He's the Demon Lord I killed.

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.164 position:50% align:center
--[RIMURU] Uh?
--Wait, you know him?!

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:39.084 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] It's more surprising
that you don't know him.

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:41.628 position:50% align:center
Still, I wonder who he is.

00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:44.047 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Answer: One of the
names Clayman called out for

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.591 position:50% align:center
when he was begging
for help was "Kazalim."

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:50.553 position:50% align:center
Okay, but what exactly does this
Kazalim have to do with Clayman?

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:52.889 position:50% align:center
[CARRION] Kazalim was known
as the Curse Lord.

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:54.057 position:50% align:center
"Curse Lord"?

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.684 position:50% align:center
--Hey, Milim.
--Huh?

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:57.852 position:50% align:center
[CARRION] It was you and
Kazalim who recommended me

00:07:57.936 --> 00:07:59.688 position:50% align:center
as a Demon Lord, remember?

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:01.147 position:50% align:center
[MILIM]
Uh...

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:02.357 position:50% align:center
Mm...

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.150 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:08:04.234 --> 00:08:06.820 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah! That's who you meant!

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.738 position:50% align:center
I do remember the Curse Lord!

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:12.117 position:50% align:center
Yep! I believe he's the
Demon Lord that Leon killed!

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.619 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Guess it was too boring
for her to remember.

00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:16.579 position:50% align:center
Yes, and if I recall correctly,

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:19.708 position:50% align:center
Kazalim was also a Deathman,
same as Clayman.

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:22.168 position:50% align:center
I'm certain they must
be connected somehow.

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:24.921 position:50% align:center
Hold on, if Kazalim
was also a Deathman,

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:27.632 position:50% align:center
is it possible he just
pretended to be killed by Leon

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:28.633 position:50% align:center
and went into hiding?

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:30.218 position:50% align:center
Yes, it's very likely.

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:32.762 position:50% align:center
From what I know of Kazalim,
he was always much sharper

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:34.389 position:50% align:center
and more cautious than Clayman.

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:37.767 position:50% align:center
[LEON] I don't appreciate you
saying it like I let him escape.

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:41.062 position:50% align:center
I merely defeated the man
and took his status for myself.

00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:43.940 position:50% align:center
Whether he is still alive or not
is of no concern to me--

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:45.567 position:50% align:center
I honestly couldn't care less.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.861 position:50% align:center
You know, that lackluster
attitude of yours is probably

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:49.863 position:50% align:center
why Clayman hated you so much.

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:52.615 position:50% align:center
[LEON]
Hmph. I don't care.

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:54.409 position:50% align:center
Some of Clayman's buddies
were a group called

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:56.202 position:50% align:center
the Moderate Harlequin Alliance.

00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:58.496 position:50% align:center
The jesters implied that some
of the people helping them

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.249 position:50% align:center
were humans, so there's probably
a good chance that Kazalim

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:05.587 position:50% align:center
was reincarnated somehow and has
possessed a human as a disguise.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.714 position:50% align:center
Actually, I think
you're right on the mark.

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:09.966 position:50% align:center
--[RIMURU] Uh?
--[GUY] Leon's attack destroys

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.801 position:50% align:center
the mind as well as the body.

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:13.803 position:50% align:center
It might even be worth
commending Kazalim

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:15.972 position:50% align:center
for surviving
something like that.

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:18.892 position:50% align:center
If it's true though, it's far
too quick a resurrection.

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:21.311 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hold up, are you
trying to say you think

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:23.146 position:50% align:center
someone helped Kazalim?

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:25.565 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's what I mean.

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:27.442 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Huh... Well, in any case,

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:29.944 position:50% align:center
I'll act under the assumption
that Kazalim has returned,

00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:31.279 position:50% align:center
and remain vigilant.

00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:32.822 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he'll probably
have it out for me

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:34.532 position:50% align:center
since I killed
Clayman or whatever--

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:36.117 position:50% align:center
Agh!
[groans]

00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:38.328 position:50% align:center
[MILIM giggles]
Don't be silly, Rimuru!

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:40.038 position:50% align:center
You're a lot stronger
than him now!

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:42.749 position:50% align:center
You've got nothing to
worry about from Kazalim!

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:44.793 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Ugh! That kind of complacency

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:47.462 position:50% align:center
is what leads to defeat!

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:50.674 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] That's right.
I can't get complacent, either.

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:52.967 position:50% align:center
It'd be one thing
if it was just me,

00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:56.554 position:50% align:center
but now there are people who
are counting on my protection.

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:07.899 position:50% align:center
Now, the topics of this
meeting were set to be about

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:10.026 position:50% align:center
Carrion's betrayal
and the rise of Rimuru

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:14.364 position:50% align:center
to a Demon Lord, but it seems
those matters have been settled.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:17.909 position:50% align:center
Are there any other topics
that need to be addressed?

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.955 position:50% align:center
I have one.

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:24.958 position:50% align:center
Although to be honest, it's more
of a request on my part.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.543 position:50% align:center
Go on.

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:30.088 position:50% align:center
[FREY] I've decided I'm going
to serve Milim from here on out.

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.007 position:50% align:center
[MILIM gasps]
Ah?!

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.049 position:50% align:center
Wait, really?

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:34.759 position:50% align:center
Uh...? Huh?

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:37.220 position:50% align:center
In fact, I'd like to
completely relinquish my status

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:38.513 position:50% align:center
as Demon Lord.

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:40.390 position:50% align:center
Well, Frey, this seems
rather sudden.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:41.599 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute!

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:43.852 position:50% align:center
I haven't heard anything
about this decision!

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:46.479 position:50% align:center
Yes. Because I didn't tell you.

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:50.233 position:50% align:center
Hmm. But... I have
my reasons for this.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:52.652 position:50% align:center
The top one being that
I no longer believe I have

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:56.156 position:50% align:center
the necessary strength
to be a Demon Lord.

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:57.657 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:00.493 position:50% align:center
Watching the battle today
helped to convince me of that.

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:02.245 position:50% align:center
Had I fought Clayman,
we would have been

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:03.997 position:50% align:center
evenly matched at best.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.915 position:50% align:center
And against Clayman's
awakened form,

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:08.835 position:50% align:center
I'm positive I wouldn't
have stood a chance.

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.462 position:50% align:center
[DAGGRULL]
But Frey...

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:13.048 position:50% align:center
Everyone here knows that
high-speed battles in the air

00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:14.758 position:50% align:center
are your specialty.

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:17.552 position:50% align:center
I see no reason for you
to put yourself down so much.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.471 position:50% align:center
[FREY] It's true that
I would have the advantage

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:22.307 position:50% align:center
in aerial combat. However,
today, I realized that

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.602 position:50% align:center
simply having the advantage
is not always enough.

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:28.521 position:50% align:center
And as for you, Milim.

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:31.399 position:50% align:center
You can't continue to make
selfish demands forever.

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:32.901 position:50% align:center
[MILIM groans]

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:34.194 position:50% align:center
[FREY] Isn't it past time
that you start thinking about

00:11:34.277 --> 00:11:36.488 position:50% align:center
how to manage
your own domain?

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:39.199 position:50% align:center
Well? Will you accept
my proposal?

00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:41.910 position:50% align:center
But... it's not really
my style to have subordinates

00:11:41.993 --> 00:11:43.203 position:50% align:center
under my rule, you know?

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:44.788 position:50% align:center
Surely there's somewhere
else you'd rather go.

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:46.122 position:50% align:center
[CARRION]
Wait just a moment.

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:47.290 position:50% align:center
As long as we're
on this subject,

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:49.334 position:50% align:center
there's something
I'd like to say.

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:52.921 position:50% align:center
As you know, I also fought
Milim one-on-one and lost.

00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:55.965 position:50% align:center
So I believe I should submit
to her completely, as well.

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:57.008 position:50% align:center
Ah?!

00:11:57.092 --> 00:11:58.259 position:50% align:center
Ooh!

00:11:58.343 --> 00:11:59.552 position:50% align:center
With that said, I'm going to be

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:02.055 position:50% align:center
your faithful subordinate
starting today.

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:04.349 position:50% align:center
It's all you, Boss! All right?!

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:05.975 position:50% align:center
Wait just a second, Carrion!

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:08.478 position:50% align:center
I only fought you because I was
being controlled by Clayman!

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:10.230 position:50% align:center
I swear I don't
even remember it!

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:11.606 position:50% align:center
You're not fooling anyone here.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.108 position:50% align:center
--It's true!
--You said it yourself!

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:14.859 position:50% align:center
"You really thought
I could be controlled by

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:16.820 position:50% align:center
such a pathetic trinket?"

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:18.571 position:50% align:center
We were all standing
right there, you know!

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:20.949 position:50% align:center
[MILIM groans]
Oh, you guys heard that, huh...?

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:22.492 position:50% align:center
Listen, I don't
particularly care

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:25.412 position:50% align:center
what that muscle-bound idiot
does, but you'll accept me,

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:26.788 position:50% align:center
won't you, Milim?

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:29.165 position:50% align:center
[MILIM gasps] Hold on, Frey,
this isn't some kind of

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:31.126 position:50% align:center
weird trick on your part, is it?

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:32.335 position:50% align:center
A trick?

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:34.212 position:50% align:center
Yeah, 'cause... If you
were my subordinate,

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:36.798 position:50% align:center
you wouldn't talk to me as
a friend anymore, would you?

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:39.384 position:50% align:center
And then you wouldn't play with
me or think up naughty schemes

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:40.927 position:50% align:center
with me anymore...

00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:44.180 position:50% align:center
Not true. Actually, I'd be able
to stay with you all the time.

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:47.142 position:50% align:center
Then we'd be able to do
even more fun things together.

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:48.351 position:50% align:center
[MILIM gasps]

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:49.853 position:50% align:center
[CARRION]
And besides...

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:51.271 position:50% align:center
This is only happening because

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:53.314 position:50% align:center
you ruined our
kingdom, remember?

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:56.192 position:50% align:center
Naturally, you're obligated
to take care of my people.

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:57.360 position:50% align:center
[MILIM whimpers]

00:12:57.444 --> 00:12:59.487 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:02.657 position:50% align:center
[MILIM]
Agh! Okay, fine!

00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:05.702 position:50% align:center
You two can do whatever you
want, I don't even care anymore!

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:07.328 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:09.622 position:50% align:center
But are you sure
this is what you want?

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:12.125 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not, I put
a lot of thought into this.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.794 position:50% align:center
I'm not saying I'll step down
from ruling Eurazania

00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:16.296 position:50% align:center
or anything.

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:17.881 position:50% align:center
I just want to come up with
a new order that puts Milim

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:19.299 position:50% align:center
at the top of it all.

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:20.967 position:50% align:center
Whoa, steady there, kiddo.

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:23.428 position:50% align:center
[GUY] You know,
I really liked you, Carrion.

00:13:23.511 --> 00:13:26.056 position:50% align:center
I had high hopes that, given
a few more centuries or so,

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.266 position:50% align:center
you would've
eventually awakened.

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:31.561 position:50% align:center
Fine, then.
As of right now,

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:33.813 position:50% align:center
Frey and Carrion are
no longer Demon Lords.

00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:36.399 position:50% align:center
Per your requests, the two of
you are now free to serve Milim

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:38.109 position:50% align:center
however you like.

00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:39.819 position:50% align:center
[FREY giggles]

00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:41.363 position:50% align:center
[CARRION chuckles]

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:43.823 position:50% align:center
[gasps, whines]

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:52.916 position:50% align:center
So, uh, hey...

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:54.417 position:50% align:center
Doesn't that mean
the "Ten Great Demon Lords"

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:56.503 position:50% align:center
are now just
the "Eight Great Demon Lords"?

00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:58.296 position:50% align:center
What?

00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.964 position:50% align:center
Yes, you're correct.

00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:02.592 position:50% align:center
As a matter of dignity, I
suppose we shall simply have to

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:05.011 position:50% align:center
come up with
a new name for ourselves.

00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:08.682 position:50% align:center
But fortunately for us, we are
still in the midst of Walpurgis.

00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:10.225 position:50% align:center
All the Demon Lords are present,

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:13.728 position:50% align:center
so I'm positive that we can
come up with a formidable idea.

00:14:13.812 --> 00:14:16.648 position:50% align:center
[DEENO] We went through hell
over this last time.

00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:18.983 position:50% align:center
We had to hold Walpurgis
over and over just so we could

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:20.860 position:50% align:center
decide on a name that worked.

00:14:20.944 --> 00:14:23.488 position:50% align:center
You hold Walpurgis over a dumb
issue like picking a name

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:25.448 position:50% align:center
for your Demon Lord club?!

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:27.450 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Are they that bored?!

00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:29.661 position:50% align:center
Oh. You're talking about names?

00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:32.372 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,
my buddy Rimuru is an expert!

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:33.748 position:50% align:center
Wah!

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:35.458 position:50% align:center
Veldora's right! He came up
with my Beretta's name

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:36.876 position:50% align:center
in no time at all!

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.086 position:50% align:center
It's true.

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:40.213 position:50% align:center
Naming is one of
Lord Rimuru's many talents!

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:42.215 position:50% align:center
[barking]

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:44.426 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:47.554 position:50% align:center
Rimuru, you stand before us
today as a new Demon Lord.

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:50.473 position:50% align:center
Therefore, I'd like to grant you
this magnificent privilege.

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:52.934 position:50% align:center
I'm honored,
but I think I'll pass.

00:14:54.728 --> 00:14:55.729 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
Hmm.

00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:00.734 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Huh-- Ah!

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:01.985 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:03.528 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
I must insist.

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:05.739 position:50% align:center
You see, I am graciously
bestowing upon you

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:08.450 position:50% align:center
the opportunity to assign
us our new name.

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:10.952 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Uh? Hhngh!

00:15:11.036 --> 00:15:13.913 position:50% align:center
As you implied,
this is a tremendous honor.

00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:16.249 position:50% align:center
It's my most fervent hope
that you will accept it.

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:17.459 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU groans]

00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:19.044 position:50% align:center
[GUY] And I hate to
remind you of this fact,

00:15:19.127 --> 00:15:21.004 position:50% align:center
but it is because of your
actions that we have

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:23.548 position:50% align:center
two fewer Demon Lords now.

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:24.883 position:50% align:center
So, tell me.

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:26.468 position:50% align:center
Will you assume the
responsibility of coming up

00:15:26.551 --> 00:15:27.469 position:50% align:center
with a name?

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:29.137 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Uh!

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.515 position:50% align:center
Uh, fine, whatever.
I can choose.

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:35.185 position:50% align:center
But don't get all mad at me
if you end up hating it.

00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:37.228 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:38.480 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:40.648 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:15:40.732 --> 00:15:42.484 position:50% align:center
--Hah...
--[sighs]

00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:48.323 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] There are eight of us,
so can't we just be

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:51.493 position:50% align:center
the "Eight Great Demon
Lords" or something?

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:54.704 position:50% align:center
Nah, I guess that's too basic.

00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:55.997 position:50% align:center
Hmm...

00:15:57.415 --> 00:16:00.794 position:50% align:center
Stars... Eight Demon Lords...

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:01.920 position:50% align:center
Eight...

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:03.838 position:50% align:center
The stars of eight...

00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:07.175 position:50% align:center
An eight-pointed star?

00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:11.179 position:50% align:center
An eight-pointed star
is an octagram, right?

00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:16.685 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Hmm... There's
eight of us, so Octagram.

00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:18.603 position:50% align:center
What do you think of that?

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:22.399 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
Hmm...

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:24.984 position:50% align:center
--[RAMIRIS] Huh...?
--[DEENO] Huh?

00:16:25.068 --> 00:16:26.820 position:50% align:center
--[DAGGRULL] Hmm?
--[LUMINUS] Hm.

00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:28.905 position:50% align:center
[MILIM]
Yeah! I think it's genius!

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:31.241 position:50% align:center
I hereby declare it
the coming of a new age!

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:32.826 position:50% align:center
Way to go!

00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:35.453 position:50% align:center
I knew if anyone could pick a
fantastic name, it'd be Rimuru!

00:16:35.537 --> 00:16:36.663 position:50% align:center
It's quite fitting.

00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:39.457 position:50% align:center
Now I understand why
Veldora recommended you.

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:41.418 position:50% align:center
Hah! I suppose it works.

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:43.586 position:50% align:center
I'll grant you
a bit of recognition.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.922 position:50% align:center
That was so easy.
Kinda weird.

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:47.215 position:50% align:center
Why the heck did we
put ourselves through

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:48.800 position:50% align:center
so much hell last time?

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:50.885 position:50% align:center
I'm fine with it.

00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:52.303 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
I see...

00:16:52.387 --> 00:16:55.682 position:50% align:center
Very well, then.
We've come to an agreement.

00:16:55.765 --> 00:16:57.600 position:50% align:center
We'll be "Octagram."

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:07.193 position:50% align:center
All right. Then I shall once
again introduce everyone

00:17:07.277 --> 00:17:11.072 position:50% align:center
in Octagram, also known as
the Eight-Star Demon Lords.

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:15.577 position:50% align:center
Demon, The Lord of Darkness:
Guy Crimson.

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:20.040 position:50% align:center
[RAINE]
Pixie of the Labyrinth: Ramiris.

00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:24.669 position:50% align:center
[RAINE] Dragonoid,
The Destroyer: Milim Nava.

00:17:25.837 --> 00:17:29.382 position:50% align:center
[RAINE]
Giant, The Earthquake: Daggrull.

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:35.847 position:50% align:center
[RAINE] Vampire, The Queen of
Nightmares: Luminus Valentine.

00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:40.852 position:50% align:center
[RAINE] Fallen,
The Sleeping Ruler: Deeno.

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:47.025 position:50% align:center
[RAINE] Demonoid, The Platinum
Saber: Leon Cromwell.

00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:52.405 position:50% align:center
[RAINE] Slime, The Newbie:
Rimuru Tempest.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.325 position:50% align:center
That concludes everything.

00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:57.410 position:50% align:center
[SHION laughs]

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:03.583 position:50% align:center
How wonderful! Congratulations!

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:05.126 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA]
Congratulations.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.712 position:50% align:center
Congratulations, Lord Rimuru!

00:18:07.796 --> 00:18:10.048 position:50% align:center
[RANGA howls]

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:12.509 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] And that's how
I became part of Octagram

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:15.553 position:50% align:center
and one of the
eight Demon Lords.

00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:16.930 position:50% align:center
On that day,

00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:20.350 position:50% align:center
the curtain rose on
a new age for the Demon Lords.

00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:31.027 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE] Since Demon Lord
Valentine is at Walpurgis,

00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:34.114 position:50% align:center
it's the perfect time to expose
the cloistered emperor.

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:35.115 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:39.577 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:41.830 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
Is that... the emperor?

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:44.666 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
No.

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:46.209 position:50% align:center
Hinata Sakaguchi?!

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:49.087 position:50% align:center
You have some gall to
intrude on this sacred ground.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:51.798 position:50% align:center
I really do despise
rats like you.

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:54.134 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE] Whoa! What the hell's
wrong with you, lady?!

00:18:54.217 --> 00:18:55.844 position:50% align:center
Curses! I thought they
were going to lure her

00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:59.389 position:50% align:center
away from here!
This wasn't part of the plan!

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:05.645 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE panting]
Demon Lord Valentine's gone,

00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:09.274 position:50% align:center
but there's no point in
sneaking around if she's here!

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:12.569 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE] There's no way I can
beat that kind of monster!

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:17.323 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
Aw, you've gotta be kidding me!

00:19:17.407 --> 00:19:19.993 position:50% align:center
Man, I can't deal with this...

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:23.621 position:50% align:center
You insect!

00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:26.374 position:50% align:center
You would dare show
your face before me again?

00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:27.584 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
It's you.

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:30.337 position:50% align:center
[ROY sighs]
All you insects are the same.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.547 position:50% align:center
Do you enjoy
running away that much?

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:33.923 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
What do you mean?

00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:36.843 position:50% align:center
Another insect, Clayman,
died only mere minutes ago.

00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:39.971 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE gasps]
Say what?

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:42.640 position:50% align:center
He was a foolish,
underhanded insect.

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:44.893 position:50% align:center
He tried to run away,
just as you are.

00:19:44.976 --> 00:19:47.854 position:50% align:center
His death was quite
the pathetic affair.

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:50.023 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE growls]

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:52.317 position:50% align:center
[ROY laughs]
Why are you so angry?

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.152 position:50% align:center
It has nothing
to do with you, right?

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:55.612 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
Shut up!

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:58.990 position:50% align:center
Hey, is it true that
Clayman's really dead?

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:01.659 position:50% align:center
[ROY laughs]
Stupid insect!

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:03.203 position:50% align:center
Your secret's out.

00:20:03.286 --> 00:20:05.622 position:50% align:center
The two of you were working
together, weren't you?

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:08.667 position:50% align:center
All is as the God Luminus
willed it to be!

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.293 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE] What the hell
are you laughing at,

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:12.003 position:50% align:center
you pile of garbage?!

00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:14.506 position:50% align:center
You would dare insult me--

00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:15.799 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
You moron!

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:17.133 position:50% align:center
[ROY grunting]

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:19.135 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE] I'll make you pay
for laughing at him!

00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:20.470 position:50% align:center
Stupid brute!

[ROY]
You've gone too far, clown.

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:29.771 position:50% align:center
Now it's time to die!

00:20:31.189 --> 00:20:34.734 position:50% align:center
You'll die by my Blood Ray!

It didn't work...

00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:38.697 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
Too bad.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.323 position:50% align:center
You're already dead.

00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:41.741 position:50% align:center
[ROY gasps]

00:20:41.825 --> 00:20:45.453 position:50% align:center
[heart beating]

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.124 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:49.207 --> 00:20:52.002 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
See? I've got your core.

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:53.795 position:50% align:center
[ROY whimpers]

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:57.048 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE] Took you a little
too long to realize that.

00:20:57.132 --> 00:21:00.885 position:50% align:center
That's right.
I'm stronger than you.

00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:05.724 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:21:05.807 --> 00:21:07.434 position:50% align:center
[ROY groans]

00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:12.480 position:50% align:center
[laughing continues]

00:21:12.564 --> 00:21:16.192 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE] Yeah,
Footman's gonna be pissed...

00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:19.195 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Tear's gonna cry...

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:22.157 position:50% align:center
And me...?
I guess I'll laugh...

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.659 position:50% align:center
[laughing fading into sobbing]

00:21:24.743 --> 00:21:28.163 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE] Clayman...
You truly were such an idiot...

00:21:28.246 --> 00:21:30.373 position:50% align:center
[sobbing continues]

00:22:10.246 --> 00:22:12.123 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
It's all over.

00:22:12.207 --> 00:22:14.501 position:50% align:center
Yes! You did wonderfully!

00:22:14.584 --> 00:22:18.338 position:50% align:center
[groans]
Whew, I'm so tired. So tired...

00:22:18.421 --> 00:22:20.423 position:50% align:center
Yeah, doing nothing
is hard work.

00:22:20.507 --> 00:22:21.424 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS]
Hmm?!

00:22:21.508 --> 00:22:22.717 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Rimuru!

00:22:22.801 --> 00:22:24.719 position:50% align:center
--Quickly! Manga!
--I know, the newest volume!

00:22:24.803 --> 00:22:26.304 position:50% align:center
Give me a break, jeez!

00:22:26.388 --> 00:22:29.265 position:50% align:center
I swear, it's hard to believe
how carefree you guys all are.

00:22:29.349 --> 00:22:30.392 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS growling]

00:22:30.475 --> 00:22:32.352 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIGERS]
Lord Rimuru!

00:22:32.435 --> 00:22:37.899 position:50% align:center
[cheering, whooping]

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:51.955 position:50% align:center
[SHION chuckles]

00:22:52.038 --> 00:22:53.581 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA]
Everyone is waiting.

00:22:53.665 --> 00:22:56.209 position:50% align:center
Come. Lord Rimuru, Lady Ramiris?

00:22:56.292 --> 00:22:58.003 position:50% align:center
Shall we go?

00:22:58.086 --> 00:23:00.296 position:50% align:center
[howls]

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.881 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU chuckles]

00:23:01.965 --> 00:23:03.174 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:23:09.055 --> 00:23:11.307 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I was supposed
to have a completely ordinary

00:23:11.391 --> 00:23:13.018 position:50% align:center
and uneventful life.

00:23:13.101 --> 00:23:14.978 position:50% align:center
But I was killed in
a random stabbing,

00:23:15.061 --> 00:23:17.772 position:50% align:center
then reincarnated in
another world as a slime,

00:23:17.856 --> 00:23:20.483 position:50% align:center
where I built
a nation of monsters.

00:23:28.533 --> 00:23:30.118 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I saved my friends...

00:23:30.201 --> 00:23:31.953 position:50% align:center
Defeated my enemies...

00:23:32.037 --> 00:23:34.998 position:50% align:center
And at the end of all of it,
joined Octagram

00:23:35.081 --> 00:23:37.125 position:50% align:center
as a bonified Demon Lord...

00:23:38.543 --> 00:23:42.339 position:50% align:center
My name is Rimuru Tempest...
and I... am a slime.
