00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:19.769 position:50% align:center
Based on the
information we have,

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:23.440 position:50% align:center
Clayman's army will likely
reach Eurazania within two days.

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:25.817 position:50% align:center
Guess he got a step ahead of us.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.278 position:50% align:center
Damn that Clayman.

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.238 position:50% align:center
He's more cunning
than I thought.

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:32.449 position:50% align:center
He probably anticipated
Walpurgis being

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:34.909 position:50% align:center
three nights from now, too.

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:37.287 position:50% align:center
He's planning to finish his
slaughter in the Animal Kingdom

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.665 position:50% align:center
while the other Demon Lords are
too preoccupied to interfere.

00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:23.435 position:50% align:center
[SUPHIA growling]

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:25.603 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] So which one of
these books is your favorite?

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:27.939 position:50% align:center
If I had to choose,
I'd say this one.

00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:29.691 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU sighs]

00:02:29.774 --> 00:02:31.901 position:50% align:center
Hey, Raphael.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.112 position:50% align:center
Hypothetically speaking,
if all the people left in

00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:36.656 position:50% align:center
the Animal Kingdom of
Eurazania are killed,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.784 position:50% align:center
will Clayman be able to awaken?

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:41.995 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Answer: The odds may be low,

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:45.040 position:50% align:center
but it is likely he will acquire
a vast amount of souls.

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:48.168 position:50% align:center
His chance of success is 78%.

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:51.254 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] That number's
a whole lot higher than pi.

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:53.340 position:50% align:center
I will stop him.

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:54.799 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I don't know
the names or faces of

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:57.093 position:50% align:center
the surviving citizens
of Eurazania,

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.220 position:50% align:center
but our ties with
them are friendly.

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:02.974 position:50% align:center
For that reason, I won't
hesitate to intervene for them.

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:04.601 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru...

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.479 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Mm.

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.189 position:50% align:center
--Benimaru.
--Yes?

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:10.398 position:50% align:center
Stop him.

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:11.900 position:50% align:center
Ha! I'll crush him.

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:15.362 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh, I mean--
Leave it to me.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:17.906 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] After that, we started
discussing our plans on how

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.035 position:50% align:center
we would stop Clayman,
but quickly hit a speedbump.

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:23.703 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU grunts]

00:03:23.787 --> 00:03:26.331 position:50% align:center
Looks like there's no way
to get there in time.

00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:30.001 position:50% align:center
If only we could send everyone
there with transport magic...

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:32.879 position:50% align:center
But, my lord, using transport
magic to move an army

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:34.339 position:50% align:center
is much too dangerous.

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:36.591 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I know that.
It was just a thou--

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:38.968 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Answer:
Transport magic can be utilized

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:41.721 position:50% align:center
to send supplies at a low cost.

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.848 position:50% align:center
The coordinates of
the destination are linked

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:46.351 position:50% align:center
through another dimension,
but the item sent is bathed

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:47.936 position:50% align:center
in a massive amount
of magicules,

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.939 position:50% align:center
so it is not recommended for
transporting organic matter.

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:53.525 position:50% align:center
However, if one can be
protected with a barrier,

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:55.694 position:50% align:center
they will not be affected
by the transport.

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:58.530 position:50% align:center
This is the basic principle
of transport magic.

00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:01.282 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] So, uh...
What does that mean?

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:04.035 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] For example, if the
target is a majin or a monster,

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:06.121 position:50% align:center
they will have a resistance
to magicules.

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center
If they can put up
their own barrier,

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:10.125 position:50% align:center
they will have no problems
being transported.

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:12.836 position:50% align:center
Alternatively, using a
Perfect Transport technique

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.130 position:50% align:center
to protect the target
would also make it possible

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:16.673 position:50% align:center
to travel safely.

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:19.926 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] That's interesting.
Could you make such a technique?

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Answer!
I have already developed it.

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:23.888 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:25.348 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] By using
it in combination with

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.308 position:50% align:center
the extra skill "Control Space,"

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:30.103 position:50% align:center
the total magicule cost
has been greatly reduced.

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:32.188 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] No way, you developed
new skills and techniques

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.065 position:50% align:center
for me, and I didn't
even have to ask?!

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:36.276 position:50% align:center
You're the bomb.com, Raphael!

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:37.902 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Thank you very much.

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:39.279 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru?

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:40.822 position:50% align:center
Shuna is right.

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:43.950 position:50% align:center
Moving an army with transport
magic is way too dangerous.

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:45.076 position:50% align:center
But...

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.661 position:50% align:center
But?

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:49.539 position:50% align:center
Heh. Luckily, I've just
developed a new technique

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:52.375 position:50% align:center
that should work!
One that is ultimately safer!

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:53.752 position:50% align:center
--Oh!
--You have?

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:56.004 position:50% align:center
--In this moment?
--Typical.

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:57.380 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Heh. I mean, technically,

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:01.343 position:50% align:center
Raphael did all
the heavy lifting.

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:04.512 position:50% align:center
Once our whole army gets
there, victory is ours.

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:06.890 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I actually feel
a little sorry for Clayman.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.683 position:50% align:center
If Raphael and I
hadn't both evolved,

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:11.227 position:50% align:center
then he might have
won in the end.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.438 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] The real question is,
are you guys in?

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:15.565 position:50% align:center
I can send our entire army
there at the same time

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.067 position:50% align:center
using this technique.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.943 position:50% align:center
But I haven't confirmed
that it's safe yet.

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:21.279 position:50% align:center
Do you still trust me?

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:23.239 position:50% align:center
You need not even ask.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.617 position:50% align:center
My loyalty is to you,
Lord Rimuru.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.452 position:50% align:center
I am your faithful retainer.

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:30.705 position:50% align:center
If you ordered me
to die, I would die.

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.290 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I trust you.

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:33.958 position:50% align:center
After everything we've seen,
there's no way

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:35.502 position:50% align:center
we could ever doubt
your greatness.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:37.253 position:50% align:center
He's also saved my life.

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.631 position:50% align:center
I won't tolerate any
complaints from my men.

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.174 position:50% align:center
My goodness.

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:43.843 position:50% align:center
It appears I have no choice
but to agree with my comrades.

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:47.013 position:50% align:center
So, I'll also put my faith
in your strength, Lord Rimuru.

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:50.058 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Okay, then!
Your lives are safe in my hands!

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:52.310 position:50% align:center
Now we have a way to get
ahead of Clayman's plan!

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:55.647 position:50% align:center
The rest is up to you guys!
Make sure you win!

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:56.773 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Right!

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:58.441 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL]
Mm-hmm.

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:04.197 position:50% align:center
[chuckling]

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.741 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU sighs]
Thanks for sticking out

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:08.618 position:50% align:center
that long meeting, everyone.

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:11.621 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow's gonna be pretty
rough. I'm counting on you.

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:14.040 position:50% align:center
Right. We won't let you down.

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:16.167 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] If only I could
pinpoint Clayman's location,

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:17.585 position:50% align:center
I could raid him with
Spatial Movement

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.504 position:50% align:center
and end this stupid game.

00:06:19.587 --> 00:06:21.798 position:50% align:center
True. But with Clayman
attending Walpurgis

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:24.801 position:50% align:center
with the other Demon Lords, you
might end up just missing him.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:25.885 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Good point.

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:27.679 position:50% align:center
--Sir! [giggles]
--[RIMURU] Shion!

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:30.140 position:50% align:center
I have the most fantastic
idea, Lord Rimuru!

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:32.434 position:50% align:center
Let's crash Walpurgis and cut
down Clayman along with

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:34.102 position:50% align:center
anyone else who defies us!

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Destroying Clayman
is one thing, but I'm not sure

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:38.440 position:50% align:center
I wanna start a fight with
the other Demon Lords.

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:40.984 position:50% align:center
Ah. Right. I understand.

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:43.695 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Oh, but crashing
the party is a good idea!

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:45.113 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:47.991 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Hey, Ramiris.
Could I attend the event, too?

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.951 position:50% align:center
What? Attend Walpurgis?

00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:51.870 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Yeah, I thought it
would be really interesting

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:53.872 position:50% align:center
if I went and saw
Clayman myself.

00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:56.499 position:50% align:center
Turn Walpurgis into
a little surprise party.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:58.376 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS grunting]

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.420 position:50% align:center
Uh, that would probably be fine.

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:02.797 position:50% align:center
But you can only bring
two other people with you.

00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:04.924 position:50% align:center
They ran into some
problems in the past,

00:07:05.008 --> 00:07:06.301 position:50% align:center
so they made a new rule.

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:08.636 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.013 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Whatcha think?

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.806 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO chuckles]

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.516 position:50% align:center
That's a splendid idea.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.893 position:50% align:center
And when the time comes,

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:16.227 position:50% align:center
it'll be my pleasure
to accompany--

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:18.646 position:50% align:center
[SHION] Don't be an idiot!
I will accompany him!

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.066 position:50% align:center
--You hear me?!
--Though, if there is trouble,

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:24.152 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru could surely
destroy anyone in his path.

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:26.446 position:50% align:center
I have complete faith that he
can handle those demon lords

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:28.156 position:50% align:center
--on his own.
--Yes, exactly!

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:29.449 position:50% align:center
I thought you were an idiot,

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:31.326 position:50% align:center
but you're actually
pretty smart for a newbie!

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:33.328 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO chuckles]

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:35.372 position:50% align:center
Hmm...

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.207 position:50% align:center
Heh...

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.291 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO, SHION chuckle]

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:40.251 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Are they frenemies or what?

00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:42.212 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Hold up, let's not go crazy.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:43.755 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Nothing's decided.

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:46.299 position:50% align:center
Besides, I already assigned
Diablo to help Youm in Falmuth,

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:48.551 position:50% align:center
so he wouldn't be able
to go with me, anyway.

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:51.262 position:50% align:center
That's true. I understand.

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:54.641 position:50% align:center
Still though. Won't it be
dangerous for you to go?

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:56.059 position:50% align:center
--[BENIMARU] No.
--[gasps]

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.520 position:50% align:center
While I highly doubt that
Lady Milim betrayed us,

00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:00.480 position:50% align:center
it is very likely she's
the one who sold out

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:02.565 position:50% align:center
Demon Lord Carrion to Clayman.

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:04.776 position:50% align:center
In my opinion,
it wouldn't hurt to look into

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:06.945 position:50% align:center
the story more at Walpurgis.

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:08.905 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS]
Heck yeah, I agree!

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:11.157 position:50% align:center
There's no way someone like
Milim would ever take orders

00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:13.952 position:50% align:center
from a stuffy guy like Clayman.

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:16.746 position:50% align:center
I mean, Milim only looks out
for herself, you know?

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.416 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Are you in any position
to accuse someone of that?

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:21.793 position:50% align:center
Lady Milim would never
betray Lord Rimuru!

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.586 position:50% align:center
It's only a baseless hunch.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.213 position:50% align:center
But it's a truth that
I feel deep down in

00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:27.090 position:50% align:center
the very depths of my soul!

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:28.925 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
A hunch, huh?

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:31.219 position:50% align:center
Heh. Yeah, I tend to agree.

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:33.930 position:50% align:center
I also don't feel like
I've been betrayed.

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:36.182 position:50% align:center
For right now, I'm going
to have faith in Milim.

00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:38.059 position:50% align:center
But that doesn't necessarily
mean I think we should

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:40.145 position:50% align:center
sit around and spin
our wheels, either.

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:42.313 position:50% align:center
What Ramiris said
about the mastermind--

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:44.649 position:50% align:center
or at least, the cause of this
mess being Clayman--

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:46.317 position:50% align:center
is pretty good insight.

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:48.528 position:50% align:center
I know! I'm amazing!

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:50.864 position:50% align:center
Just leave everything to me,
Great Detective Ramiris--

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:52.532 position:50% align:center
my judgement is never wrong!

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:53.533 position:50% align:center
Great job!

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:55.910 position:50% align:center
Wonderful! Very impressive!

00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:57.579 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS]
Mm-hmm!

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.874 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Anyway, that's why
I think it would be a good idea

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:04.711 position:50% align:center
to attend Walpurgis and
see if we can get some answers.

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:06.796 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
The question is "who to take."

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.173 position:50% align:center
[SHION gasps]

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:09.966 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU groans]

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.509 position:50% align:center
[SHION whimpering]

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:13.887 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] If I don't take her,
she'll probably go berserk.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.348 position:50% align:center
On the plus side, it might give
Shion a chance to get revenge

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:18.975 position:50% align:center
on Clayman for
orchestrating her murder.

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:21.603 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Okay. I'll take
Shion and Ranga with me.

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:23.855 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Thank you so much!

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:26.191 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] As always,
you can count on me, Master!

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:28.234 position:50% align:center
--[pants quickly]
--[VELDORA laughs]

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:30.362 position:50% align:center
--[GROUP] Hmm?
--[VELDORA] Now we're talkin'!

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:32.447 position:50% align:center
Hey, Rimuru! Don't leave me out!

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.075 position:50% align:center
I'm going with you
to Walpurgis, too!

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:37.619 position:50% align:center
There aren't any
Demon Lords who scare me!

00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:39.037 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Hold up, Veldora.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.414 position:50% align:center
I need you to stay here
and protect the city.

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:42.749 position:50% align:center
You can't go.

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:44.501 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] What?! But I could
destroy a Demon Lord

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.544 position:50% align:center
with one little squeeze!

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:49.005 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Protecting this city
is an important job, too.

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:52.092 position:50% align:center
If anything, it might be
the most important job of all.

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:55.178 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Huh...? You don't say.

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:58.014 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I do, so promise
you'll hold down the fort, okay?

00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:59.015 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS]
Wait, Rimuru!

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:00.558 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Huh...?

00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:02.727 position:50% align:center
If he wants, Master Veldora
can come as one of my guests!

00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:04.854 position:50% align:center
Plus, it'd make me
feel way safer.

00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:07.190 position:50% align:center
Nah, I have no interest
in tagging along

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:09.275 position:50% align:center
just so I can serve as
your personal guard dog.

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:13.113 position:50% align:center
What?! No fair!
Please don't be so mean, Master!

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:15.573 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Why is she calling him "Master"?

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:17.617 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Ahem! Veldora.

00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
Spreading the word about you
is actually part of the plan.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.080 position:50% align:center
We talked about that
at the big meeting,

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:24.124 position:50% align:center
so I'm sure you've gotta
be well aware of it.

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:27.752 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA gulps]
Yes! Of course, I'm aware!

00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:31.589 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Oops. I can't tell
my BFF I wasn't listening!

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:33.508 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Not to mention,
if I show up with you,

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:36.761 position:50% align:center
Clayman might be all like:
"Ohoho, Rimuru had to bring

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:39.889 position:50% align:center
Veldora to be his ringer?
What a huge tool!"

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:40.974 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
What was that?!

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:43.560 position:50% align:center
Damn that Clayman!
I'll make him pay!

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:45.478 position:50% align:center
That jerk ought
to learn his place!

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:47.147 position:50% align:center
I will have to punish him!

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.649 position:50% align:center
And by punish,
I mean kill completely!

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:53.445 position:50% align:center
Ugh. All right.
Calm down, Shion.

00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:55.947 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru was only
speaking hypothetically.

00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:58.408 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Basically, I'm just
saying that if we bring Veldora,

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.410 position:50% align:center
then it's gonna put
everyone on their guard.

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.537 position:50% align:center
Ah. Makes perfect sense!

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.122 position:50% align:center
You're so wise, sir!

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:06.916 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO chuckles] The fact that
he could belittle Lord Rimuru

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.044 position:50% align:center
even hypothetically
is unforgivable.

00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:12.172 position:50% align:center
I would like to purge him with
my own hands, but this time...

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:13.882 position:50% align:center
I will leave the task to Shion.

00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:16.051 position:50% align:center
Oh? You're so generous!

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:17.594 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO chuckles]

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:20.388 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Maybe these
guys aren't frenemies?

00:11:20.472 --> 00:11:22.515 position:50% align:center
[SHION] So, you're hoping
to make negotiations easier

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:24.100 position:50% align:center
by throwing him off his guard?

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:26.061 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA] Wait, that sounds
awfully dangerous.

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:27.479 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Nah, it's cool.

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:29.564 position:50% align:center
If things go south, I can
actually call Veldora with

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:31.358 position:50% align:center
my Summon Storm Dragon skill.

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:33.693 position:50% align:center
No way! Can you really?!

00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:36.279 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Yep, if things get
too dicey, I'll give you a ring.

00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:37.989 position:50% align:center
In the meantime,
just chill around here

00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:39.741 position:50% align:center
and keep an eye on stuff.

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:42.660 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
I see!

00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:45.372 position:50% align:center
So, I'm the hero who arrives
just in the nick of time!

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:46.748 position:50% align:center
Wow, unfair.

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:48.792 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I'd rather you call it clever.

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:51.586 position:50% align:center
And besides, that frees up one
of your two attendant slots,

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:52.629 position:50% align:center
doesn't it?

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:55.590 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS gasps]
Oh yeah. Good point!

00:11:55.674 --> 00:11:58.093 position:50% align:center
Okay then, so who do you plan
to send along with me?

00:11:58.176 --> 00:11:59.761 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I'm kind of thinking Hakurou--

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:01.471 position:50% align:center
[TREYNI]
Wait a moment!

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:06.726 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru! I beg you.
Pick me for this task.

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.436 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS]
Treyni...

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.438 position:50% align:center
You'd do that for me?

00:12:10.522 --> 00:12:12.649 position:50% align:center
I wish to ask the same of you.

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:15.276 position:50% align:center
Please allow my sister
to accompany Lady Ramiris

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.028 position:50% align:center
to the Walpurgis council.

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:18.029 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU groans]

00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:19.698 position:50% align:center
[TREYNI whimpers]

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:24.828 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] All right.
If that's what you want, Treyni.

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:26.329 position:50% align:center
[TREYNI gasps]

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:30.875 position:50% align:center
--Yes!
--Treyni, yay! [giggles]

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:34.254 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] It's settled. I'll take
Shion and Ranga to Walpurgis.

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:36.673 position:50% align:center
And Ramiris will be
accompanied by her attendants,

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:38.842 position:50% align:center
Beretta and Treyni.

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:41.886 position:50% align:center
And the ace up our sleeve
will be the Veldora summon!

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.763 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Heh!

00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:44.889 position:50% align:center
[GROUP grunts]

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:46.599 position:50% align:center
[RANGA panting]

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:48.101 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Hmph.

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:49.936 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU sighs]

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.897 position:50% align:center
Leon Cromwell...
The Demon Lord that Shizu had

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:56.609 position:50% align:center
a bad history with,
will probably be at Walpurgis.

00:12:56.693 --> 00:13:01.281 position:50% align:center
Oh, well. For the time being,
Clayman is our primary target.

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:05.410 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Clayman...

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:07.203 position:50% align:center
You've made an enemy of me.

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.748 position:50% align:center
If it's a fight you want,
then get ready.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.959 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] You crossed the line
when you hurt my friends.

00:13:13.043 --> 00:13:15.920 position:50% align:center
And now, I'm gonna make sure
you pay the price.

00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:27.766 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY growling]
Ugh!

00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:29.768 position:50% align:center
Those detestable bastards!

00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:32.812 position:50% align:center
How dare they mock us with
suggestions of cooperation?!

00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:36.066 position:50% align:center
Hey, now. We only need to do
what they ask us this one time.

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:38.151 position:50% align:center
I mean, there's not much
we can do about it.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:39.819 position:50% align:center
Their commander,
Yamza, had a written order

00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:41.237 position:50% align:center
from Lady Milim herself.

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:42.572 position:50% align:center
Quiet, Hermes.

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:45.033 position:50% align:center
I don't need you to tell me
what I already know.

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:47.243 position:50% align:center
She really destroyed Eurazania.

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:49.871 position:50% align:center
I guess even someone like
Lady Milim has her issues.

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:51.831 position:50% align:center
Watch your tongue, Hermes!

00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:54.376 position:50% align:center
Don't you ever doubt
the actions of Lady Milim again!

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:56.836 position:50% align:center
[HERMES]
Right. Sorry, Father Middray.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.672 position:50% align:center
[HERMES] It's because he's so
soft on her that I have to

00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:00.924 position:50% align:center
suffer all the time, though.

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:03.677 position:50% align:center
Still, curse that Clayman!
The audacity!

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.013 position:50% align:center
Imagine forcing Lady Milim
to write an order like that.

00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:08.306 position:50% align:center
It is strange.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:10.558 position:50% align:center
But it was definitely
the lady's handwriting.

00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:12.686 position:50% align:center
And since it's an order,
we have to comply.

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:14.979 position:50% align:center
Clayman's entire army
is ravenous.

00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:17.691 position:50% align:center
The lot ate all the food
from our third storehouse.

00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:19.484 position:50% align:center
There's only seven houses left.

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:20.568 position:50% align:center
We're gonna have
a real rough time

00:14:20.652 --> 00:14:22.070 position:50% align:center
until the next harvest season.

00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:23.279 position:50% align:center
Bastards!

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:27.617 position:50% align:center
[growling]

00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:30.787 position:50% align:center
[HERMES]
A red... melon!

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.039 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:14:33.123 --> 00:14:34.374 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:40.088 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY] Yamza.
The Magic Swordsman of Ice.

00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:42.298 position:50% align:center
Hey. Be on your guard, Hermes.

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:43.383 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:44.801 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hmm.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.056 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA]
Hello, Father Middray.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.851 position:50% align:center
Thank you again for
supplying our forces with food.

00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:55.353 position:50% align:center
When you have an army
of 30,000 to take care of,

00:14:55.437 --> 00:14:57.814 position:50% align:center
it seems like there's never
quite enough to go around.

00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:00.650 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I'm just honored
that we could be of help

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:03.653 position:50% align:center
to you at all.
Though I've unfortunate news.

00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:05.405 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid we cannot afford
to supply you with

00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:06.990 position:50% align:center
any more resources.

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:09.159 position:50% align:center
If people went hungry,
I'm sure it would

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:11.327 position:50% align:center
greatly sadden Lady Milim--

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:12.912 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA] What's this crap
you're spouting?!

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:16.124 position:50% align:center
Lady Milim is the one
who made this choice!

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:19.002 position:50% align:center
We're the ones having to
clean up after her stupid mess,

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:21.671 position:50% align:center
so you should try treating us
with a little more respect!

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:23.298 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY growls softy]

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:24.674 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA]
Well...?

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:28.511 position:50% align:center
Right. Please forgive me.

00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:30.680 position:50% align:center
For a moment there,
I was unable to think of anyone

00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:32.265 position:50% align:center
but our own people.

00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:35.310 position:50% align:center
Rest assured, sir, we will do
anything we can to assist you.

00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:37.437 position:50% align:center
Don't hesitate
to ask us for help.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.731 position:50% align:center
[HERMES]
Huh, no melon-head this time.

00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:42.359 position:50% align:center
Well, if he lost his temper,
these guys would probably use it

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:44.778 position:50% align:center
as an excuse to wipe out
the entire country.

00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:46.196 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA]
Is that so?

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:48.073 position:50% align:center
Then I'm sure you'll be
happy for another opportunity

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:49.532 position:50% align:center
to help us.

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:51.868 position:50% align:center
You can at least transport
supplies for us, can't you?

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:54.579 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What?!
Now hold on just a moment!

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:56.289 position:50% align:center
First you steal all our food,

00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:58.750 position:50% align:center
and now you want
free labor, too?

00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:02.462 position:50% align:center
[HERMES gasps]

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.467 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA]
Trash. Shut up.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.136 position:50% align:center
[HERMES groaning]

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:14.557 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA] Oh? You still
don't know your place.

00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:16.893 position:50% align:center
I guess you want to die, huh?

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:20.188 position:50% align:center
[HERMES] This fool's on
some kind of damn power trip!

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:22.691 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY grunts]

00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:25.902 position:50% align:center
[HERMES rasps]

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:33.326 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY sighs] I do beg you for
your forgiveness, Sir Yamza.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.954 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I will give
this idiot a good talking-to.

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:39.165 position:50% align:center
Until then, please allow me
to apologize on his behalf.

00:16:39.249 --> 00:16:42.794 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA] Hmph. It's never easy
having an idiot in your service.

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:46.339 position:50% align:center
I'll forgive you. We'll be
departing tomorrow morning.

00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:48.091 position:50% align:center
It would be in your
best interest for you

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:50.927 position:50% align:center
and your priests to
be ready to go by then.

00:16:57.851 --> 00:16:59.352 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY sighs]

00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:04.149 position:50% align:center
[HERMES groaning]

00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:07.235 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY] You really are stupid.
To be fair, I tried to warn you.

00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:10.363 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sorry, I couldn't
help myself.

00:17:10.447 --> 00:17:13.158 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY]
Activate Holy Magic: Recovery.

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:19.873 position:50% align:center
It's fine. Even with
the priests away,

00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:22.459 position:50% align:center
the people won't face
any immediate hardship.

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:24.294 position:50% align:center
Still, he makes me so angry!

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:27.380 position:50% align:center
How dare he come here
and injure Lady Milim's people?

00:17:27.464 --> 00:17:29.132 position:50% align:center
Father Middray...

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:31.593 position:50% align:center
[HERMES] Says the guy who kicked
the stuffing out of me.

00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:33.470 position:50% align:center
Yeah. He's a real jerk.

00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:34.929 position:50% align:center
Maybe I should kill the guy.

00:17:35.013 --> 00:17:37.557 position:50% align:center
You fool! You'd never best him!

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.101 position:50% align:center
You're right. That sword
of his is trouble.

00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:42.479 position:50% align:center
It kinda seemed like he was
hiding something else, too.

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:44.314 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY] Agreed.
Typical for a henchman of

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:46.775 position:50% align:center
that underhanded tyrant,
Demon Lord Clayman.

00:17:46.858 --> 00:17:48.610 position:50% align:center
Seems he won't show
his hand so easily!

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:51.237 position:50% align:center
A real man would achieve
victory by baring all!

00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:53.323 position:50% align:center
It's true.

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:56.284 position:50% align:center
[MIDDRAY sighs]
Come along, Hermes.

00:17:56.368 --> 00:17:57.535 position:50% align:center
We leave tomorrow.

00:17:57.619 --> 00:17:59.954 position:50% align:center
Ah. Yes, sir.

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:06.711 position:50% align:center
Still though. Lady Milim's
continued absence worries me.

00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:12.467 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU sighs] How can
we protect all the citizens

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:17.013 position:50% align:center
left in Eurazania? Is there
a place that's safe for them?

00:18:17.097 --> 00:18:19.182 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Answer: The most
efficient choice would be to

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:21.601 position:50% align:center
transport all the
people to one place.

00:18:21.685 --> 00:18:25.063 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Huh? Oh, snap! Great idea!

00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:26.439 position:50% align:center
I hadn't thought of that.

00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:29.317 position:50% align:center
The army isn't the only thing
we can transport!

00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:31.236 position:50% align:center
You've done it again, Raphael!

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.613 position:50% align:center
It's just like
the Columbus Egg puzzle!

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:35.407 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
It's nothing so phenomenal.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:36.950 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Uh...

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:39.703 position:50% align:center
Anyway, now we know that we can
just move the citizens here!

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:41.913 position:50% align:center
Let's roll!

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:44.499 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I immediately found
Geld and gave him the order.

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:47.377 position:50% align:center
Within a few short hours,
we'd made preparations to accept

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.170 position:50% align:center
a ton of refugees.

00:18:49.254 --> 00:18:51.840 position:50% align:center
Then, I made use of my brand-new
technique by zipping over

00:18:51.923 --> 00:18:54.050 position:50% align:center
to Eurazania and teleporting
everyone we could find

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.928 position:50% align:center
to Tempest quicker than
you could say Columbus's Egg.

00:18:57.012 --> 00:18:58.513 position:50% align:center
Since I had Phobio with me,

00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:00.432 position:50% align:center
everyone we talked to was
more than willing to hear

00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:01.725 position:50% align:center
what I had to say.

00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:04.811 position:50% align:center
Thanks to that, the whole
process went smoothly.

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:07.063 position:50% align:center
We continued to transport
more and more of them in

00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:08.690 position:50% align:center
without any rest.

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:11.609 position:50% align:center
And by morning, any citizens
remaining in Eurazania

00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:13.945 position:50% align:center
had been transported to safety.

00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:18.158 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU sighs]
You okay, man?

00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:20.618 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I'm exhausted. Ugh.

00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:23.163 position:50% align:center
Aren't you tired after using
that transport magic?

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:24.873 position:50% align:center
You were going
nonstop all night.

00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:26.624 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Oh, that's because...

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:28.084 position:50% align:center
Because?

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:31.880 position:50% align:center
Because I'm the amazing
leader of Tempest!

00:19:31.963 --> 00:19:34.716 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that doesn't
really make sense.

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:38.470 position:50% align:center
But I'm too tired
to question it any further.

00:19:38.553 --> 00:19:39.554 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Anyway!

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:41.097 position:50% align:center
We don't have time
to laze about!

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:44.309 position:50% align:center
There's still more stuff
that I need you guys to do!

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:45.602 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:47.312 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Yep.

00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:50.357 position:50% align:center
We still had the battle against
Clayman's forces waiting

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.108 position:50% align:center
for all of us.

00:20:00.784 --> 00:20:02.077 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] On the field
in front of me were

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.662 position:50% align:center
Albis, Suphia, and Phobio.

00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:06.873 position:50% align:center
They were the Three Beastketeers
and they would lead

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:10.001 position:50% align:center
the 10,000
Lycanthropes behind them.

00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:13.338 position:50% align:center
I had Gobta
to lead the Goblin Riders.

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:15.799 position:50% align:center
And we had put together a team
of Ogres who would serve as

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:19.511 position:50% align:center
Benimaru's personal
guard--the Kurenai.

00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:22.138 position:50% align:center
We also had 4,000 hobgoblins.

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:25.141 position:50% align:center
We called that team
the "Green Numbers."

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center
There were 5,000
High Orcs led by Geld.

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:30.438 position:50% align:center
The Yellow Numbers.

00:20:30.522 --> 00:20:34.693 position:50% align:center
And the Dragonewts led by
Gabiru known as Hiryu.

00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:37.320 position:50% align:center
We totaled 20,000
soldiers strong.

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:39.239 position:50% align:center
And staying behind
to protect Tempest was

00:20:39.322 --> 00:20:42.867 position:50% align:center
Shion's personal guard, which
had around 100 members.

00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:44.953 position:50% align:center
Since they're the ones
that I brought back to life,

00:20:45.036 --> 00:20:48.415 position:50% align:center
I called their team Yomigaeri.

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:51.584 position:50% align:center
My lord! Everyone is here.

00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:53.336 position:50% align:center
We are ready.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.587 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Mm.

00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:57.090 position:50% align:center
Then... Let's get everyone
here transported!

00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:58.216 position:50% align:center
[ALBIS]
Lord Rimuru.

00:20:58.299 --> 00:20:59.467 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:01.678 position:50% align:center
Thank you. We'll never
forget your kindness.

00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:03.471 position:50% align:center
Now, we can rattle some cages!

00:21:03.555 --> 00:21:04.889 position:50% align:center
Knowing that our people
are safe means we

00:21:04.973 --> 00:21:06.599 position:50% align:center
can fight without worry.

00:21:06.683 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
Of course, we'll leave
destroying Clayman to you.

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:11.521 position:50% align:center
But give him a punch or two
from us, okay?

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:13.148 position:50% align:center
[PHOBIO grunts]

00:21:13.231 --> 00:21:14.441 position:50% align:center
[SUPHIA]
Uh...

00:21:18.862 --> 00:21:20.196 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Mm.

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:23.033 position:50% align:center
Be safe...

00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:24.534 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Mm.

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:28.163 position:50% align:center
[SHION] There's no need to
show them any mercy, Benimaru!

00:21:28.246 --> 00:21:29.706 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:32.417 position:50% align:center
