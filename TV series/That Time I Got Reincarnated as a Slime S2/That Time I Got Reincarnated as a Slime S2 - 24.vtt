[RIMURU grunts] Hey,
what the heck are you

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:55.949 position:50% align:center
doing here, Veldora?
I didn't even call for you!

00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:59.411 position:50% align:center
Excuse me. I didn't think
you'd be so mad about it.

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:03.289 position:50% align:center
But, you see, I'm here
because... of this!

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:04.791 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
A manga, seriously?

00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:06.793 position:50% align:center
Ah! I'm dead serious!

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:09.170 position:50% align:center
I mean, it ends just as
it's starting to get good!

00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:10.797 position:50% align:center
Are you trying to torment
me or something?!

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.549 position:50% align:center
Where's the newest volume?!

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.342 position:50% align:center
And what happens
to Pai and Yakumo?

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:16.386 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] So you came all this
way just because you wanted

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.888 position:50% align:center
to read the next
volume of a manga?

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.348 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Do you expect me
to just sit around

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:21.933 position:50% align:center
and use my imagination?!

00:02:22.017 --> 00:02:23.393 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
That's awesome.

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:25.895 position:50% align:center
Guess he can just show up
even if I don't summon him.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.564 position:50% align:center
--[VELDORA] I command you to--
--I'll give you the newest

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:30.483 position:50% align:center
volume, but first,
you gotta do me a favor!

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:32.027 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Uh? What's up?

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.363 position:50% align:center
See that girl, Milim? Could you
maybe play with her for a bit?

00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:36.948 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Milim?

00:02:37.032 --> 00:02:39.659 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, she's my older
brother's only child!

00:02:39.743 --> 00:02:41.286 position:50% align:center
This is the first time
I've ever seen her,

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:43.121 position:50% align:center
but she's still
just a kid I see.

00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:45.290 position:50% align:center
Very well!
Leave it to me, Rimuru!

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:46.791 position:50% align:center
"Your brother's only child"?

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:48.418 position:50% align:center
Do I even wanna know
what that means?

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:51.338 position:50% align:center
Wait, nevermind, we can
worry about that later.

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:54.299 position:50% align:center
One more thing--Milim is being
controlled by Clayman.

00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:56.676 position:50% align:center
So make sure you don't
hurt her or anything.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.012 position:50% align:center
"Being controlled"? Hold on,
that would be impossible--

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:00.221 position:50% align:center
Have fun, buddy!

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:03.016 position:50% align:center
I-- H-Hey!

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.601 position:50% align:center
Whatever.

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:08.188 position:50% align:center
Fine then, Milim. How would you
like to have it out with me?

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:10.774 position:50% align:center
Ranga! Are you okay?!

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:13.568 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hello, Master.
I'm just fine.

00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:15.403 position:50% align:center

She's another pawn suffering

under Clayman's control.

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:32.253 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.
I'm coming to save you.

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:35.840 position:50% align:center
Ranga. Stop the other two.
Don't let them get in my way.

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:37.634 position:50% align:center

[BERETTA]
Ah. Hello there, Lord Rimuru.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:37.235 position:50% align:center
I regret that I was unable
to show you what I'm capable of,

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50% align:center
but I have at least prepared
these spoils of war for you.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.241 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] "Spoils of war"?
Wait, so this scrap metal

00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:46.745 position:50% align:center
is all that's left of Clayman's
"finest masterpiece"?

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:50.874 position:50% align:center
You took down that thing
like it was nothing.

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
Hey, Beretta, listen.
I hate to say this,

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:57.714 position:50% align:center
but aren't you just copying some
of Ramiris's worst qualities?

00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:59.049 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA]
Huh?!

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:00.967 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I-If it's just my
imagination, then cool,

00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:03.303 position:50% align:center
but what are you gonna do
with these "spoils"?

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:05.430 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA]
Oh! Well, you see...

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:07.807 position:50% align:center
...I was planning to present
them to you as a gift.

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:10.101 position:50% align:center
And I had this foolish idea
that, after accepting them,

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:13.521 position:50% align:center
you might consider offering
Lady Ramiris and myself a place.

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:15.357 position:50% align:center
You know, in Tempest.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.109 position:50% align:center
Really? I remember Ramiris
said that she wanted

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:20.236 position:50% align:center
to live in Tempest,
but I didn't realize

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.364 position:50% align:center
it was a big deal
to you, too.

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:23.865 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA]
The truth is...

00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:26.618 position:50% align:center
Earlier, Demon Lord Guy
told me that I needed to decide

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:29.746 position:50% align:center
which master to serve and
I responded by telling him

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:31.289 position:50% align:center
that after assisting you,

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:34.000 position:50% align:center
I would happily
serve Lady Ramiris.

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:35.335 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so?

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:37.337 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA] You see,
if Lady Ramiris were to relocate

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.881 position:50% align:center
to Tempest, then I would have
no choice but to follow her

00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:42.759 position:50% align:center
in the move. In this manner,
even though Lady Ramiris

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:46.012 position:50% align:center
would be my master, I could
still serve you indirectly.

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:47.597 position:50% align:center
Talk about your loopholes.

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:50.433 position:50% align:center
You really do sound
more and more like Ramiris.

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:52.519 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA] I am delighted
by your generous praise.

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:54.187 position:50% align:center
It's not a compliment!

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.772 position:50% align:center
--[BERETTA] Huh?
--[sighs]

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:58.066 position:50% align:center
Look, let's just put
a pin in that for now.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.318 position:50% align:center
I can't whip up a place
for you guys outta nowhere,

00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:02.320 position:50% align:center
so let me just think
about it, okay?

00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA]
Of course. I understand.

will recover instantly!

that deals spiritual damage?

It's not that rare, is it?

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.823 position:50% align:center
Recently, a human named
Hinata Sakaguchi had one.

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:32.327 position:50% align:center

by using that as a reference.

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:37.207 position:50% align:center

I will happily add

her impudent little sword
to my collection, as well!

This is the ultimate spell that
can control even a Demon Lord!

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:57.143 position:50% align:center
I admit it's a bit of a waste
to use it on mere majin

00:07:57.227 --> 00:08:00.438 position:50% align:center
such as you two, but I need to
rebuild my Five Fingers anyway.

00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:04.192 position:50% align:center
So I might as well make good
use of you as my new minions.

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:06.778 position:50% align:center

spell or what?

[gasps]

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:10.115 position:50% align:center

Because I don't feel anything.

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:12.117 position:50% align:center

just give it more time?

It seems useless to me.

Not to mention, if you need to
rely on cheap moves like that,

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:34.222 position:50% align:center
you aren't worth calling
a Demon Lord.

[snarls]

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.037 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
Behold!

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.621 position:50% align:center
No more hiding!

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:00.707 position:50% align:center
This is my real power!

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.501 position:50% align:center
You see, I really am
a true Demon Lord!

00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:06.421 position:50% align:center
I chose to be particular about
how I fought, always burying

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:09.174 position:50% align:center
my enemies with the utmost
grace and elegance!

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:11.843 position:50% align:center
But the time for mercy
is now over!

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:15.513 position:50% align:center
Yes, I had nearly forgotten
what my real power feels like.

00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:18.558 position:50% align:center
Are you ready?!
Because now...

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:23.480 position:50% align:center
...I'm going to obliterate
you with my own hands!

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:25.023 position:50% align:center

[SHION]
Oh?

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:33.198 position:50% align:center
My opinion of you
has slightly improved.

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:34.908 position:50% align:center
Just a bit.

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:37.410 position:50% align:center
I am Lord Rimuru's
secretary, Shion.

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:39.788 position:50% align:center
And I shall be your opponent!

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:44.626 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN] I'm Demon Lord--
No, Crazy Pierrot Clayman!

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:48.129 position:50% align:center
And I will kill you,
majin Shion!

This fight is over.

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:36.594 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN groaning]
It can't be...

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:39.055 position:50% align:center
Impossible... I mean,
you're just a weakling--

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:41.975 position:50% align:center
nothing more than
a pathetic little majin.

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:45.437 position:50% align:center
I can't lose!
I'm the Demon Lord Clayman!

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.563 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
Lord Rimuru.

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:49.107 position:50% align:center
Do I have permission
to finish him?

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.400 position:50% align:center
No, damn it all!

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.569 position:50% align:center
Where is Milim?
What the hell is she doing?

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:55.280 position:50% align:center
I command you
to decimate this rabble!

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:57.365 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN gasps]

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:00.493 position:50% align:center
Wha... Who's that?

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:02.662 position:50% align:center
That aura, it's insane!

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:04.789 position:50% align:center
Such phenomenal power!

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:06.750 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's my friend...

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:07.876 position:50% align:center
...Veldora.

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:09.878 position:50% align:center

Hmph. Tetsuzanko!

Kamehameha!

[gasps]
Frey! What are you doing?!

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:31.983 position:50% align:center
Come and assist me at once!

00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:34.652 position:50% align:center
Me? I do apologize, Clayman.

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:36.654 position:50% align:center
Sadly, none can pass
through this barrier

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:40.575 position:50% align:center
without Guy's consent.
Seems my hands are tied.

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:43.078 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN gasps]
Milim! Listen to me!

00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:45.789 position:50% align:center
Obey my command and use
your Stampede defense!

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:46.831 position:50% align:center
I don't care anymore.

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:49.000 position:50% align:center
Just kill every
single person here!

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:52.671 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Holy crap, he said
the quiet part out loud!

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.802 position:50% align:center
Why in the world would I
do something so ridiculous?

00:11:58.885 --> 00:11:59.844 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN gasps]

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:01.304 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Ah!

00:12:04.099 --> 00:12:06.935 position:50% align:center
Rimuru and Shion
are my friends, silly!

00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:10.563 position:50% align:center
[MILIM]
Hmm-hmm!

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:14.109 position:50% align:center
Milim! You aren't under
a spell or anything?!

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:15.276 position:50% align:center
[MILIM]
Mm...?

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.112 position:50% align:center
[cackles]

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:18.488 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Uh...?

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:21.658 position:50% align:center
Well, it appears I successfully
fooled you, Rimuru!

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:24.119 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Hold up, you haven't
been under his control at all?!

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:27.080 position:50% align:center
--[MILIM] Nope!

[RANGA]
Arf!

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA]
Hmm.

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:32.002 position:50% align:center
[MILIM giggles]

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:34.212 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Yep, it was obvious
to me at first glance.

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:36.006 position:50% align:center
Wait, wha--? Huh?!

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.507 position:50% align:center
[DAGGRULL]
Of course.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.926 position:50% align:center
[DEENO] And yet she didn't
react to being punched earlier.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.845 position:50% align:center
--[FREY chuckles]
--[GUY] Hmm.

[screams]

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.476 position:50% align:center
But I used the mind-controlling
stone he gave me!

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center
That idiot should have been
completely under my control!

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:54.816 position:50% align:center
She even killed off Beastmaster
Carrion at my order!

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:55.942 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:12:56.026 --> 00:12:57.902 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Wow. Way to just admit it.

00:12:57.986 --> 00:13:00.697 position:50% align:center
He also confirmed someone else
is behind it all.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.824 position:50% align:center
You really thought I could
be controlled by such

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:04.701 position:50% align:center
a pathetic trinket?

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:10.248 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN gasps]

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:12.000 position:50% align:center
Answer me, Clayman!

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:13.752 position:50% align:center
Who is this
mysterious benefactor

00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:15.837 position:50% align:center
that's been helping you?

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.672 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN snarls]

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:19.632 position:50% align:center
[MILIM growls]

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:22.927 position:50% align:center
Wait, so you suspected something
was up from the start?

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:24.220 position:50% align:center
Then why kill Carrion?!

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:26.514 position:50% align:center
[CARRION] Hey, now,
who are you calling dead?

00:13:26.598 --> 00:13:30.393 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
That voice...

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:33.188 position:50% align:center
[CARRION grunts]

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:36.483 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
It's Carrion?!

00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:38.985 position:50% align:center
Hiding in the world's
most obvious disguise?!

00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:40.487 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL sighs]

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.072 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Ah! Crap, why do
I get the feeling that Raphael

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:43.865 position:50% align:center
is exasperated with me?

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.200 position:50% align:center
--[RAPHAEL] Ugh...
--Wah!

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:49.037 position:50% align:center
Yo, Beastmaster Carrion!
I'm glad you're okay!

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.082 position:50% align:center
Well... I wouldn't
say I'm entirely "okay."

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:54.167 position:50% align:center
But thanks for looking
after my people.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.670 position:50% align:center
Oh, that was nothing!

00:13:56.753 --> 00:13:57.671 position:50% align:center
[CARRION]
Heh.

00:13:57.754 --> 00:13:59.631 position:50% align:center
Ah... No...

00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:01.466 position:50% align:center
What...? It can't be...

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:03.802 position:50% align:center
But, Frey's report said...

00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:08.973 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Wait, you lied?! So did
you betray me, as well, Frey?!

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:11.476 position:50% align:center
"Betray"? For that to be true,
I would have had to have been

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:13.269 position:50% align:center
on your side to begin with.

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:15.438 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN snarls]
What?!

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:16.690 position:50% align:center
How dare you!

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:18.441 position:50% align:center
Fine! In that case...

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:20.360 position:50% align:center
...I'll make you all pay!

00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:23.029 position:50% align:center
I won't let you
get away with this insult!

00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:25.323 position:50% align:center

[GUY]
Hmm.

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:07.282 position:50% align:center
[FREY] I had faith that you
couldn't be manipulated,

00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:09.409 position:50% align:center
but I admit, I was nervous.

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:13.038 position:50% align:center
Still... You managed to keep
the promise you made to me.

00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:14.456 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Milim.

[MILIM cackles]

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:18.668 position:50% align:center
Of course, I did--
we're friends, Frey!

00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:21.171 position:50% align:center
More importantly, do you
still have those thingies

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:22.589 position:50% align:center
I gave you to hold on to?

00:15:22.672 --> 00:15:25.258 position:50% align:center
Sure do. You mean
these, correct?

00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:26.843 position:50% align:center
[MILIM giggles]

00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:29.346 position:50% align:center

00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:40.732 position:50% align:center
What a dull performance
this was.

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:43.818 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS grunts] Y-Yeah,
I knew it was all an act!

00:15:43.902 --> 00:15:46.946 position:50% align:center
[DAGGRULL grunts] Same here,
it was obvious to me, as well.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.240 position:50% align:center
It takes more
than that to fool me.

00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:50.825 position:50% align:center
[MILIM]
Hey, Rimuru!

00:15:50.909 --> 00:15:52.744 position:50% align:center
It made me super happy
to find out that

00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:54.329 position:50% align:center
you were angry on my behalf!

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:57.415 position:50% align:center
Seriously? I'm relieved
you're okay, though.

00:15:57.499 --> 00:15:59.167 position:50% align:center

How was it even possible...?

00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:07.967 position:50% align:center
Oh, that? It wasn't easy.

00:16:08.051 --> 00:16:10.470 position:50% align:center
You're a pretty
cautious guy, after all!

00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:12.555 position:50% align:center
I had to work super-duper
hard and play pretend

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:14.265 position:50% align:center
in order to fool you!

00:16:14.349 --> 00:16:15.850 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Hey, Raphael.

00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:18.895 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid to ask, but did you
also know Milim was just acting?

00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:21.731 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
You did, huh?

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:24.526 position:50% align:center
And that's why you couldn't
identify the spell.

00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:26.486 position:50% align:center
Sorry I doubted you.

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:27.696 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Hmph!

00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:29.030 position:50% align:center
[CARRION]
By the way, Milim.

00:16:29.114 --> 00:16:30.824 position:50% align:center
[MILIM]
Hmm? What's up?

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.785 position:50% align:center
So I'm to believe you weren't
under Clayman's control, right?

00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:35.161 position:50% align:center
[MILIM]
That's what I said!

00:16:35.245 --> 00:16:36.955 position:50% align:center
Which means this whole time,
that you were actually

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:39.666 position:50% align:center
just happily tormenting me, huh?

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:41.251 position:50% align:center
Well...?

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:44.337 position:50% align:center
Ah! Um... That was actually...

00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:46.589 position:50% align:center
You know, what's the word
for it again...?

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:49.509 position:50% align:center
A ploy, right...?
Uh, yeah!

00:16:49.592 --> 00:16:51.970 position:50% align:center
No, no, it's absolutely fine,
it just means that

00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:53.930 position:50% align:center
I'm much weaker than you are.

00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:56.516 position:50% align:center
Then again... It would also
mean that when you ripped

00:16:56.599 --> 00:17:00.103 position:50% align:center
a giant hole in my kingdom, you
did it of your own free will!

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:02.355 position:50% align:center
[MILIM growls]
Hey! Don't tell me you're mad

00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:03.940 position:50% align:center
about one tiny detail!

00:17:04.024 --> 00:17:05.233 position:50% align:center
It's not a tiny detail!

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:07.527 position:50% align:center
My entire city is ruined,
and I could have died!

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.362 position:50% align:center
Ugh, don't be such a whiny baby!

00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:12.240 position:50% align:center
I had to blow up your stupid
city in order to fool Clayman,

00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:14.200 position:50% align:center
so it was all just
passionate acting, okay?!

00:17:14.284 --> 00:17:16.619 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you should be mad
at Clayman, not me!

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:17.787 position:50% align:center
[wheezing]

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:20.290 position:50% align:center
[CARRION]
It was all Clayman's plan, huh?

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:23.209 position:50% align:center
Well, it doesn't matter.

00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:25.545 position:50% align:center
On the plus side, the
Beastketeers and your people

00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:28.298 position:50% align:center
are safe and sound! Not to
mention we fought our best today

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:30.050 position:50% align:center
to help you get revenge!

00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:33.178 position:50% align:center
Meaning there's totally
a silver lining in this cloud.

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:34.804 position:50% align:center
You're right, Rimuru.

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:36.306 position:50% align:center
[sniffs]

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:38.141 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry
you had to console me.

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:40.060 position:50% align:center
Everything's gonna be just fine!

00:17:40.143 --> 00:17:42.812 position:50% align:center
And besides, you can
always rebuild a city.

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:45.357 position:50% align:center
I took Clayman's majin henchmen
prisoner to make laborers

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.525 position:50% align:center
of them for that
specific purpose.

00:17:47.609 --> 00:17:49.694 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you being serious?

00:17:49.778 --> 00:17:51.196 position:50% align:center
And we'll help, too!

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:54.282 position:50% align:center
Let's make it an even more
comfortable nation than before!

00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:56.659 position:50% align:center
We also may have helped
ourselves to Clayman's treasury

00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:58.411 position:50% align:center
to fund the cause.

00:17:58.495 --> 00:17:59.412 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:02.248 position:50% align:center
[CARRION gasps]

00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:05.877 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much!
Rimu-- Uh, Mister Rimuru!

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.796 position:50% align:center
From this day forward,
the Animal Kingdom will

00:18:07.879 --> 00:18:12.133 position:50% align:center
spare no effort to assist your
nation as a permanent ally!

00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:20.850 position:50% align:center
[cackles]

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:24.354 position:50% align:center
Feel free to thank me, too!
I knew it would all work out.

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:27.232 position:50% align:center
You could at least pretend to
feel bad for destroying my city!

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:28.233 position:50% align:center
[MILIM]
Hmm?

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:30.360 position:50% align:center
[blows raspberry]

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:32.195 position:50% align:center
So, laborers, huh?

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:34.239 position:50% align:center
You know, I originally thought
you were a naïve fool

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:36.908 position:50% align:center
to let Clayman's
majin keep their lives,

00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:39.869 position:50% align:center
but it seems you have some
very interesting ideas.

00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:43.581 position:50% align:center
I'm starting to understand why
Black took such a liking to you.

00:18:43.665 --> 00:18:46.418 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Hmm? Black? Who is that?

00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:48.003 position:50% align:center
Now then, Clayman.

00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:51.256 position:50% align:center
I didn't interfere because Milim
was trying so hard to fool you.

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:52.924 position:50% align:center
But you made me angry, too.

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:54.551 position:50% align:center
You will pay.

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:57.053 position:50% align:center
Even if survival of
the fittest is our rule,

00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:59.014 position:50% align:center
you took things a little far.

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:01.850 position:50% align:center
And I hope you know that I will
have revenge on you for the mess

00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:03.476 position:50% align:center
you made of our kingdom.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.312 position:50% align:center
[wheezing]

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:12.110 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
I'd be careful around her.

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:17.574 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN] Yes, Laplace,
it would seem you were right.

00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:21.244 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN] All of you placed
your trust in me.

00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:24.039 position:50% align:center
You even gave me
the role of Demon Lord.

00:19:24.122 --> 00:19:27.459 position:50% align:center
But it seems, this is the end.

00:19:36.718 --> 00:19:37.635 position:50% align:center
[TEAR]
Clayman.

00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:39.137 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
Hmm?

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.805 position:50% align:center
[TEAR] You're weaker than
all of us, so don't do go doin'

00:19:40.889 --> 00:19:44.309 position:50% align:center
anything reckless
on your own, got it?

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:46.478 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
Yes... Tear...

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:49.105 position:50% align:center
[FOOTMAN]
Yoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:54.027 position:50% align:center
Tear's got a point! Make sure
you rely on us if you need to.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.739 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
Yes, Footman... that's right.

00:19:57.822 --> 00:19:59.699 position:50% align:center
I had forgotten...

00:19:59.783 --> 00:20:03.244 position:50% align:center
I wanted to get as close
to all of you as possible...

00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:06.664 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN] I wanted you to
recognize me as a member of

00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:09.501 position:50% align:center
the Moderate Harlequin Alliance.

00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:13.338 position:50% align:center
[YUUKI]
Hey, your name's Clayman, right?

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:15.757 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
My, you address me so casually.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.217 position:50% align:center
Do you have a death wish?

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.719 position:50% align:center
[YUUKI] Come on, there's
no need for such threats.

00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:22.514 position:50% align:center
I'll have you know
I'm here by invitation.

00:20:22.597 --> 00:20:23.932 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
"Invitation"?

00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:27.227 position:50% align:center
That's right, from your creator,
the Demon Lord Kazalim.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:28.520 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN gasps]

00:20:30.313 --> 00:20:31.773 position:50% align:center
[YUUKI]
You see...

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:35.527 position:50% align:center
I'm going to make this world
mine, and I want you to help me.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.196 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
Huh. [laughs]

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:40.657 position:50% align:center
Interesting. Is this a request?

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.576 position:50% align:center
[YUUKI] Yes. For the Moderate
Harlequin Alliance.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.203 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
What is the reward?

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:46.746 position:50% align:center
Let's see...

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.998 position:50% align:center
How about the resurrection
of Kazalim?

00:20:49.082 --> 00:20:50.458 position:50% align:center
You interested?

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:53.128 position:50% align:center
Heh. Yes.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.093 position:50% align:center
[YUUKI sighs] Let's take this
world with our own hands.

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:03.096 position:50% align:center
Then, we'll spend
our lives having fun!

00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:08.560 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN] The resurrection of
Demon Lord Kazalim was achieved.

00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:12.772 position:50% align:center
Yet my carelessness resulted
in this absolute mess.

00:21:12.856 --> 00:21:16.401 position:50% align:center
[KAZALIM]
Clayman. You are much like me.

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:18.111 position:50% align:center
I don't mind that.

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:22.407 position:50% align:center
But just try not to take after
my bad sides, okay?

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:24.242 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
Lord Kazalim...!

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:27.537 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
I can't...

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.581 position:50% align:center
I can't die yet!

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:33.501 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN] If I die now, before
I could accomplish anything,

00:21:33.585 --> 00:21:36.296 position:50% align:center
I could never forgive myself!

00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:39.716 position:50% align:center
I don't care if I never awaken
as a True Demon Lord.

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:42.093 position:50% align:center
So please, I beg you.

00:21:42.177 --> 00:21:44.971 position:50% align:center
Give me power, please!

00:21:45.055 --> 00:21:47.724 position:50% align:center
Overwhelming power!

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:50.602 position:50% align:center
Give it to me!

00:21:50.685 --> 00:21:52.562 position:50% align:center
[WORLD]
Request confirmed.

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:55.106 position:50% align:center
Converting soul to energy.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:56.566 position:50% align:center
Successful.

00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:58.985 position:50% align:center
Dismantling body
to act as receptacle.

00:21:59.069 --> 00:22:01.696 position:50% align:center
Initiating rebuild.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.656 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
Yes!

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.743 position:50% align:center
It seems the heavens
have not yet abandoned me!

00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:08.703 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]
Back up, Shion!

00:22:17.045 --> 00:22:22.801 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN laughing]

00:22:22.884 --> 00:22:25.136 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Looks like
it's really begun now.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.971 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
Lord Rimuru, what's happening?

00:22:27.055 --> 00:22:29.933 position:50% align:center
It's Clayman's awakening, Shion.
Just as I planned.

00:22:30.016 --> 00:22:33.520 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see, you planned for this?
Well, that's a huge relief!

00:22:33.603 --> 00:22:37.565 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Yes. It's all going
according to Raphael's plan.

00:22:37.649 --> 00:22:39.275 position:50% align:center
That mass of hatred...

00:22:39.359 --> 00:22:41.820 position:50% align:center
...is the remnants of all the
souls of the people Clayman

00:22:41.903 --> 00:22:45.115 position:50% align:center
has killed.
We're releasing them.

00:22:45.198 --> 00:22:48.535 position:50% align:center
Clayman's awakening was
necessary for that to happen.

00:22:48.618 --> 00:22:49.994 position:50% align:center
His awakening?

00:22:50.078 --> 00:22:53.206 position:50% align:center
I don't want to believe it,
but that power is immense.

00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:55.000 position:50% align:center
--We shall fight--
--Please don't, Carrion.

00:22:55.083 --> 00:22:56.835 position:50% align:center
Allow me to handle this battle.

00:22:56.918 --> 00:22:58.044 position:50% align:center
[CARRION]
Ah...

00:22:58.128 --> 00:23:00.046 position:50% align:center
I took the title
of Demon Lord, too.

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:02.966 position:50% align:center
This fight is necessary
for me to succeed.

00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:04.217 position:50% align:center
I'll get rid of him.

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.803 position:50% align:center
And the others will
have to recognize me.

00:23:08.013 --> 00:23:09.472 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN sighs]

00:23:11.099 --> 00:23:12.600 position:50% align:center
You'd better not lose.

00:23:12.684 --> 00:23:13.768 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Mm.

00:23:16.146 --> 00:23:17.647 position:50% align:center
Good luck, Rimuru!

00:23:17.731 --> 00:23:19.607 position:50% align:center
Just keep your cool, okay?

00:23:19.691 --> 00:23:20.900 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
Hmm.

00:23:29.576 --> 00:23:30.744 position:50% align:center
All right, Clayman.

00:23:30.827 --> 00:23:32.871 position:50% align:center
It's time to put an end to this!

00:23:32.954 --> 00:23:34.622 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN laughs]

00:23:34.706 --> 00:23:38.335 position:50% align:center
Yes! I shall do that with
my newly acquired power!

00:23:38.418 --> 00:23:39.711 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:23:39.794 --> 00:23:42.005 position:50% align:center
You'll all regret
making a fool out of me!

00:23:42.088 --> 00:23:44.966 position:50% align:center
I'll force you to
accept my retribution!
