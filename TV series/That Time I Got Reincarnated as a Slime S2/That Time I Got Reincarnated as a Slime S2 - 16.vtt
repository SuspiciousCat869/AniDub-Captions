Huh?

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:25.400 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS groaning]

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:27.027 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Ramiris?!

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.111 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS groaning]

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:29.195 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Why are you here?

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.741 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Because I heard everything!

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:36.161 position:50% align:center
Tempest, your country,
is doomed to fall!

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:37.871 position:50% align:center
Ah?

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:40.915 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
What did you say?

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:42.625 position:50% align:center
That's right! It's doomed--

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:43.877 position:50% align:center
Ahh!

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.963 position:50% align:center
Get your hands off me!
What's the big idea?!

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:50.050 position:50% align:center
Even with my considerable
mana, I can't escape!

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.344 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru. Would you
like me to dispose of

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:54.387 position:50% align:center
this ridiculously
loud bug for you?

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.056 position:50% align:center
What did you call me?!
What's your problem?!

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:59.059 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Leave it to Diablo to
manhandle a Demon Lord.

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:01.770 position:50% align:center
Whoa! This is clearly
no ordinary person!

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:05.815 position:50% align:center
So, uh... Sorry to ask,
but do you know this fairy?

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.526 position:50% align:center
Sure do. Ramiris is actually
a good friend of mine,

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.237 position:50% align:center
and, despite the fact that she's
tiny, is another Demon Lord.

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:13.990 position:50% align:center
--[RAMIRIS] Tiny and powerful!
--I see. That makes sense.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.201 position:50% align:center
I'll have you know that even
though I may be travel-size,

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:18.244 position:50% align:center
I'm still one of the Ten
Great Demon Lords!

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:19.454 position:50% align:center
[FUZE]
Nice.

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:22.123 position:50% align:center
Seriously? You could
at least act surprised!

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:23.333 position:50% align:center
When they speak of Ramiris,

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.251 position:50% align:center
the Fairy of the Labyrinth,
they mean me!

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.837 position:50% align:center
Or are you just one of those
guys that's hard to impress?

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.255 position:50% align:center
No, it's not that.

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:31.800 position:50% align:center
But they already dropped
the Storm Dragon's return on us.

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:35.512 position:50% align:center
So, I guess at this point,
nothing surprises me anymore.

00:01:37.013 --> 00:01:37.931 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Mm.

00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:39.849 position:50% align:center
C'mon. The Storm Dragon?

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.268 position:50% align:center
You're not saying
Veldora has returned.

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:43.770 position:50% align:center
There's no way that's true.

00:01:43.853 --> 00:01:47.190 position:50% align:center
Why, I sank the giant baby with
one punch back in the day!

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.234 position:50% align:center
He was all roar and no bite!

00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:52.445 position:50% align:center
If you want my opinion, no one
should be afraid of that loser.

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:54.614 position:50% align:center
That geezer of
a dragon's era is over!

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:57.409 position:50% align:center
If you wanna fear and worship
someone, I'm available!

00:01:57.492 --> 00:02:04.082 position:50% align:center
[cackles]

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:08.586 position:50% align:center
--[RIMURU] Veldora.
--[VELDORA] Hmm?

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.796 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Sorry to bug you,

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.549 position:50% align:center
but could you watch
this girl for a while?

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.175 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Hmm?

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:15.719 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS]
Hmm? Wait, Veldora?

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.053 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Hmm.

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:19.639 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS sighs]

00:02:19.723 --> 00:02:21.850 position:50% align:center
You kids play nice now.

00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:24.728 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Hmm...

00:03:57.404 --> 00:04:01.032 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Okay. Time to get down
to business for realsies.

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:03.618 position:50% align:center
This is the strategy for how
we'll make our big announcement

00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:05.161 position:50% align:center
to the public.

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:08.665 position:50% align:center
I'll state I'm a Demon Lord,
but won't admit I've awakened.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:11.251 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] The story is that the
greedy King Edmaris of Falmuth

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:15.755 position:50% align:center
sent an army to attack Tempest,
started a war with us, and lost.

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.340 position:50% align:center
Got it?

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:20.093 position:50% align:center
We don't say his whole army was
wiped out by a single Demon Lord

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:22.387 position:50% align:center
because other nations will
have an easier time believing

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.222 position:50% align:center
that they were
defeated in battle.

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:26.599 position:50% align:center
Following that, the massive
number of casualties

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:29.811 position:50% align:center
in the Falmuth army was enough
misfortune to break the seal,

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:31.688 position:50% align:center
reviving the sleeping
monster inside,

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.857 position:50% align:center
the Storm Dragon Veldora.

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:38.403 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:40.864 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] To stop Veldora,
I joined forces with

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.323 position:50% align:center
the Champion known as Youm,

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:45.285 position:50% align:center
and after a great number of
sacrifices, we succeeded.

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:48.163 position:50% align:center
We calmed down the angry dragon
and made a deal with him.

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:50.665 position:50% align:center
He would now be worshipped
as a guardian.

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.959 position:50% align:center
And if we set up the story
with that premise,

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:55.712 position:50% align:center
it'll help establish my claim
to being a demon lord.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:58.590 position:50% align:center
Falmuth takes the blame
and we're the good guys.

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.925 position:50% align:center
[FUZE]
Hmm...

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.719 position:50% align:center
Come on, think about it.

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.847 position:50% align:center
People fear those they do not
understand, and because of that,

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.891 position:50% align:center
they'll never
willfully accept them.

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:10.727 position:50% align:center
And a monster who can slaughter
20,000 men single handedly

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.562 position:50% align:center
will find few people
willing to believe

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:16.524 position:50% align:center
that they only want to pursue
peace or diplomatic relations.

00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:19.152 position:50% align:center
That's why if we just say it was
the Storm Dragon

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:22.822 position:50% align:center
Veldora's doing, they'll
be more likely to believe it.

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:26.493 position:50% align:center
The Storm Dragon is a mastermind
when it comes to catastrophe.

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:30.372 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Wow, you must be
a man of excellent judgment

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.165 position:50% align:center
if you're calling
me a mastermind.

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:34.292 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
It's not a compliment, my dude!

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:37.504 position:50% align:center
I might be biased, but I'm
in favor of this decision.

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:40.256 position:50% align:center
Stating that my daughter helped
Lord Rimuru become a Demon Lord

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.342 position:50% align:center
would only inspire
fear and disdain.

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:43.927 position:50% align:center
If he had successfully
negotiated with

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.180 position:50% align:center
the Storm Dragon, because of his
ascension into a Demon Lord,

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:49.599 position:50% align:center
it will ultimately be better
for us in the long run.

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:50.600 position:50% align:center
[chuckles nervously]

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:52.644 position:50% align:center
There are other
advantages to it.

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:54.896 position:50% align:center
Besides reassuring humans
that I'm not dangerous,

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.107 position:50% align:center
it'll make the other Demon Lords
who are wary of me

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.983 position:50% align:center
think Veldora's the only threat.

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:01.861 position:50% align:center
Which will make it easier
for me to take action.

00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:04.114 position:50% align:center
And the most significant
advantage is when they find out

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.700 position:50% align:center
we have the power to
negotiate with Veldora.

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:08.743 position:50% align:center
They'll be hard pressed to
find anyone dumb enough

00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:10.120 position:50% align:center
to mess with us.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.622 position:50% align:center
Is there anyone here
opposed to this?

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:15.333 position:50% align:center
It puts a lot of blame on
your shoulders, Veldora,

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:16.459 position:50% align:center
is that cool with you?

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:18.003 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
It's not a problem for me.

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:19.212 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:20.672 position:50% align:center
I've made up my mind
to shoulder your karma

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:22.507 position:50% align:center
alongside you, Rimuru.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.509 position:50% align:center
Feel free to use the influence
of the Storm Dragon

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:26.386 position:50% align:center
all you like.

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.972 position:50% align:center
Okay. Thanks, buddy.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.807 position:50% align:center
I'm also in favor of this plan.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.350 position:50% align:center
It will be beneficial
in continuing

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:34.394 position:50% align:center
our trade negotiations
with the other countries

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:35.603 position:50% align:center
that surround us.

00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:38.023 position:50% align:center
Yes! Excellent work,
Lord Rimuru!

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:39.816 position:50% align:center
Yet another brilliant idea!

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:42.235 position:50% align:center
Nah. I owe this one
to King Gazel.

00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:45.071 position:50% align:center
I only organized
our thoughts together.

00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:46.239 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL]
Hmph.

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:48.241 position:50% align:center
Then you have
my gratitude, King Gazel.

00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:50.785 position:50% align:center
When we finally make our move,
we can count on great things

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:53.079 position:50% align:center
due to Lord Rimuru's backing
and your planning.

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:54.706 position:50% align:center
[PHOBIO]
Hmm.

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.499 position:50% align:center
Heh. I understand.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:59.753 position:50% align:center
With that settled, we can shift
our focus to taking out Clayman.

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:01.796 position:50% align:center
And if we still can't win,
it will mean that we were

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.798 position:50% align:center
incompetent from the start.

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.718 position:50% align:center
Okay. So that's the plan
on revealing to the world

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:10.472 position:50% align:center
how I became a Demon Lord.
Did everyone follow that?

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:14.434 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Good. So now I'd like to discuss

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:16.519 position:50% align:center
where we're gonna go from here.

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:17.520 position:50% align:center
Youm?

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:18.521 position:50% align:center
[YOUM]
Huh?!

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:21.441 position:50% align:center
Ahem. Uh, yes.

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:23.193 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Hmm?

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.653 position:50% align:center
The country of Falmuth's
going to need a new king.

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:28.156 position:50% align:center
I'd like to personally back
Youm the Champion.

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:29.866 position:50% align:center
He's going to help me
found a new nation.

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:30.867 position:50% align:center
[YOUM groans]

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.661 position:50% align:center
Are you serious? Youm as a king?

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:37.415 position:50% align:center
So, the first step will be
to release King Edmaris.

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:39.376 position:50% align:center
Then we'll make him
pay reparations for

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.211 position:50% align:center
his invasion of Tempest.

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:44.089 position:50% align:center
Yes, but I can't imagine
Falmuth will be all that eager

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:45.632 position:50% align:center
to pay reparations.

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:47.300 position:50% align:center
That's what we're hoping for.

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:49.761 position:50% align:center
By refusing, it'll act
as an incentive.

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:52.472 position:50% align:center
Ultimately, our real goal
will be to incite a civil war

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:54.557 position:50% align:center
inside of Falmuth's borders.

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:57.268 position:50% align:center
Once we've let it destroy
itself, Falmuth can be reborn

00:07:57.352 --> 00:08:01.731 position:50% align:center
as a new nation, with Youm
the Champion as its new king.

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:05.068 position:50% align:center
Lucky for us, Youm's pretty
popular among its citizens.

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:07.070 position:50% align:center
[YOUM]
Hmm?

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:09.239 position:50% align:center
[ERALD]
Hmm?

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:11.366 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL]
Hmm... Very well.

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:15.328 position:50% align:center
I can't say I have any
objections to the overall idea.

[YOUM growls]

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:33.972 position:50% align:center
I need to know, as king, are you
prepared to stand and suffer

00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:35.682 position:50% align:center
for the good of your people?

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:38.476 position:50% align:center
[YOUM grunting]

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.645 position:50% align:center
Go on, I'm waiting.

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:46.109 position:50% align:center
Huh! How should I know?

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:50.655 position:50% align:center
It's not like I'm becoming
a king because I want to.

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:54.242 position:50% align:center
Still though... This role was
handed to me based on trust.

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:57.412 position:50% align:center
What kind of man
would I be if I refused?

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:58.997 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL]
Huh...

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.207 position:50% align:center
[YOUM] What I don't want is to
decide I can't do it and give up

00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:03.543 position:50% align:center
before I've even tried.

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.045 position:50% align:center
And if I'm being honest...

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:07.047 position:50% align:center
...I'm mostly just trying
to impress a woman.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.090 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Stupid...

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:10.633 position:50% align:center
Heh...

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:13.428 position:50% align:center
If I'm gonna do this thing,
then I'll give it all I've got.

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:19.059 position:50% align:center
He's definitely stupid,
that's for sure.

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:21.311 position:50% align:center
But I do believe
what he's saying.

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:24.189 position:50% align:center
Please, King of the Dwarves,
I give you my guarantee.

00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:25.857 position:50% align:center
This man may be truly stupid...

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.400 position:50% align:center
He gets the damn
point, thank you!

00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:28.943 position:50% align:center
...but he's a good guy.

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:31.237 position:50% align:center
And until the day comes that he
can be called the Hero King

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:35.367 position:50% align:center
like you, I, Grucius, swear
I will always watch over him.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.786 position:50% align:center
Yes, I swear to do so, as well.

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:46.086 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL]
Hmph. That's good enough for me.

00:09:48.296 --> 00:09:50.965 position:50% align:center
If you ever require aid,
I am happy to help.

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:52.717 position:50% align:center
--[YOUM gasps]
--[MJURRAN chuckles]

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:54.886 position:50% align:center
With that said,
you certainly found

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:57.263 position:50% align:center
a rather interesting
candidate for the throne.

00:09:57.347 --> 00:09:59.474 position:50% align:center
Imagine becoming king
of an entire nation

00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:01.393 position:50% align:center
just to impress
the woman you love.

00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:03.645 position:50% align:center
[laughter]

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:05.480 position:50% align:center
Oh, I...

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:07.482 position:50% align:center
Pretty impressive, Grucius.

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:09.818 position:50% align:center
I sure never thought I'd
hear you so boldly betray

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:12.696 position:50% align:center
Lord Carrion right in front of
his Three Beastketeers.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:15.573 position:50% align:center
What? Hold on, that
wasn't my intention.

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:18.118 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU chuckles]

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:19.494 position:50% align:center
All right, Youm.

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:21.705 position:50% align:center
With that settled, what I would
seek from your country

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:23.248 position:50% align:center
is agricultural production.

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:24.499 position:50% align:center
[YOUM]
Hmm?

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:26.418 position:50% align:center
Having something you can
specialize in trade-wise

00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:29.421 position:50% align:center
will make it easier to
co-exist with other nations.

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:30.797 position:50% align:center
It's better than competing, yes?

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.923 position:50% align:center
[YOUM chuckles]

00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:33.967 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I'll second that request, Youm.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.095 position:50% align:center
We can talk later about
what kind of crops we want.

00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:39.139 position:50% align:center
On top of things as always!

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:40.348 position:50% align:center
Leave it to me.

00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:42.642 position:50% align:center
Falmuth's agriculture
is pretty advanced,

00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:44.561 position:50% align:center
so I think they'll accept.

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.855 position:50% align:center
[FUZE] As the representative
of the Kingdom of Blumund,

00:10:46.938 --> 00:10:48.732 position:50% align:center
I have a suggestion.

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:50.150 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
What's up?

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:51.776 position:50% align:center
I believe that we can also
contribute to the backing

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.778 position:50% align:center
of Youm as Falmuth's new king.

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:55.238 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.365 position:50% align:center
[FUZE] Blumund is friendly
with two nobles of Falmuth.

00:10:57.449 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
One is Marquis Muller and the
other is known as Count Herman.

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center
If we can negotiate with them
to join our side on this matter,

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:06.458 position:50% align:center
I believe it would greatly
benefit our cause.

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:08.752 position:50% align:center
That way, when the time
comes for Youm to rise to

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:12.088 position:50% align:center
his new position, we would have
the support of two nobles.

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:14.257 position:50% align:center
Dude, that would
be awesome, but...

00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:16.176 position:50% align:center
As a guildmaster,
do you even have the power

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:18.720 position:50% align:center
to make those sort of promises?

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:21.139 position:50% align:center
A fair concern.
But please try to understand

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:22.932 position:50% align:center
that I'm here as
a man of the state,

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:24.851 position:50% align:center
not just as the guildmaster.

00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:26.895 position:50% align:center
Today, I speak to you
as the assistant leader

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:29.064 position:50% align:center
of the intelligence
bureau of Blumund.

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:30.565 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:33.234 position:50% align:center
And you believe that these
nobles are trustworthy, right?

00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:35.236 position:50% align:center
I've no reason
to suspect otherwise.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.864 position:50% align:center
Marquis Muller is related
to the king of Blumund.

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:40.575 position:50% align:center
And as it turns out, Count
Herman owes Marquis Muller

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:43.578 position:50% align:center
a tremendous debt, so
he would never betray him.

00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:45.080 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Interesting...

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:47.332 position:50% align:center
But should you really be
telling us stuff like that?

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:48.833 position:50% align:center
Seems like a secret.

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:51.920 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
Not to worry, it's okay.

00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:54.881 position:50% align:center
Besides, I'm sure King Gazel
already knew about it.

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:57.717 position:50% align:center
I've heard the tales of the
Dark Agents of Dwargon.

00:11:57.801 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
Word has it that they're
as talented as

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:01.262 position:50% align:center
our own intelligence agency.

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:02.639 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL]
Hmm.

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:05.058 position:50% align:center
I like where your head's at.
All right, Fuze.

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:07.268 position:50% align:center
I want you to immediately
contact Marquis Muller

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:08.895 position:50% align:center
and Count Herman
to get them on board,

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:11.064 position:50% align:center
and try to be as
discreet as possible.

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:13.942 position:50% align:center
Of course. Leave it
to me, Lord Rimuru.

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:15.276 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
You get all that, Youm?

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.153 position:50% align:center
Sure did. Sounds
like a good plan.

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.571 position:50% align:center
Awesome.

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:21.157 position:50% align:center
That should cover Youm
the Champion's rise to kingship.

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:23.451 position:50% align:center
And this way, when he
makes his triumphant return,

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:24.994 position:50% align:center
it'll be one heck of a show!

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:25.995 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.831 position:50% align:center
[laughter]

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:29.207 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.793 position:50% align:center
[ERALD laughing]

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:33.128 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]

00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:36.464 position:50% align:center
[ERALD laughing

00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:38.383 position:50% align:center
Look at all these leaders
and representatives

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:40.969 position:50% align:center
of entire nations freely
sharing their honest thoughts

00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:42.929 position:50% align:center
with no suspicion whatsoever!

00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:45.306 position:50% align:center
To be completely transparent,
I almost feel like a fool

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.767 position:50% align:center
for having so many
reservations around you.

00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:48.810 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:51.396 position:50% align:center
Come on, Dad,
it's not that funny.

00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:58.361 position:50% align:center
A question for you. Be truthful.

00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:00.363 position:50% align:center
When it comes to
the leader of Tempest,

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.949 position:50% align:center
do you really trust
a monster like Rimuru?

00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:07.871 position:50% align:center
[FUZE]
Sorry? What do you mean by that?

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:10.373 position:50% align:center
Even if a bunch of monsters
were to start a country

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:11.708 position:50% align:center
the way these ones did,

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:14.002 position:50% align:center
was it really necessary for
Blumund to immediately

00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:16.671 position:50% align:center
recognize them as their
own independent nation?

00:13:16.755 --> 00:13:20.383 position:50% align:center
And then, to so hastily enter
into trade agreements with them?

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:21.968 position:50% align:center
[FUZE growls]

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:24.304 position:50% align:center
I'm just saying if it were me,
I would have kept my business

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:26.181 position:50% align:center
with Tempest more unofficial

00:13:26.264 --> 00:13:28.224 position:50% align:center
while keeping an eye on
the Western Holy Church

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:29.517 position:50% align:center
to see what they did.

00:13:29.601 --> 00:13:31.644 position:50% align:center
You see, I would feed them
confidential reports

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.355 position:50% align:center
but let them handle
any problems,

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:36.066 position:50% align:center
that way you can enjoy fruitful
profits without being beholden

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
to one side or the other.

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:40.403 position:50% align:center
Understand? That's probably
a much safer way

00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:42.906 position:50% align:center
for a small nation
to handle itself.

00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:47.118 position:50% align:center
[FUZE growls]

00:13:47.202 --> 00:13:51.623 position:50% align:center
Gah! All right, fine,
you win this round, okay?

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:54.250 position:50% align:center
Since you insist, I guess I
have no choice but to be honest

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:55.502 position:50% align:center
with everybody here.

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:58.630 position:50% align:center
Yes. At first, I was of
the same opinion as you.

00:13:58.713 --> 00:14:00.715 position:50% align:center
I admit it.

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:03.301 position:50% align:center
And before Lord Rimuru
came to visit Blumund,

00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:05.720 position:50% align:center
I mentioned as much
to my superior.

00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:08.723 position:50% align:center
But at the time, I was denied
and he expressed his concerns

00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:12.018 position:50% align:center
about my actions leading
us to war with Tempest.

00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:13.853 position:50% align:center
When it was all said and done,

00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:15.772 position:50% align:center
it was decided we
should trust them,

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:18.316 position:50% align:center
and that Blumund would find
a way to peacefully co-exist

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.485 position:50% align:center
with this nation.

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:22.529 position:50% align:center
Of course, your country
and the Dwarven Kingdom

00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:24.197 position:50% align:center
are both much larger.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.783 position:50% align:center
So, I'm sure you have far more
options available to you.

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:28.993 position:50% align:center
However, if a nation as small
as Blumund makes even

00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:31.121 position:50% align:center
the tiniest mistake,
we're done for.

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:33.289 position:50% align:center
And if we're going to put our
fate on the line anyway,

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:36.167 position:50% align:center
then I suppose I'd rather put
my trust in a monster leader,

00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:38.628 position:50% align:center
than seek aid from
the Western Holy Church.

00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:41.256 position:50% align:center
--[RIMURU chuckles]
--[FUZE] So. That's my reason.

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:45.593 position:50% align:center
Ah. And then you rushed here
to assist Lord Rimuru in battle.

00:14:45.677 --> 00:14:47.846 position:50% align:center
Was that also your
superior's decision?

00:14:47.929 --> 00:14:49.723 position:50% align:center
You've got it figured out.

00:14:49.806 --> 00:14:51.725 position:50% align:center
And now that we've entered
a mutual security pact

00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:54.561 position:50% align:center
with Tempest, I've been ordered
to uphold our end of the bargain

00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:56.062 position:50% align:center
no matter the cost.

00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:58.773 position:50% align:center
To be honest, even if our
government had broken their side

00:14:58.857 --> 00:15:01.192 position:50% align:center
of the pact, I still would
have come to their aid.

00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:04.029 position:50% align:center
At the end of the day,
I'm a free man.

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:09.409 position:50% align:center
You know, sometimes
I wonder why I took this job.

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:12.245 position:50% align:center
Basically, the day I agreed
to become an official member

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:14.414 position:50% align:center
of Blumund's
intelligence bureau,

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:16.708 position:50% align:center
is also the day my luck ran out.

00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:18.752 position:50% align:center
Who is your superior, anyway?

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:20.962 position:50% align:center
Oh, just the king of the nation.

00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:22.756 position:50% align:center
You know how it is.

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:25.550 position:50% align:center
I hope that you'll
pardon my bold questions.

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:27.093 position:50% align:center
But thanks in part
to your candor,

00:15:27.177 --> 00:15:29.262 position:50% align:center
I can at least say that
I now fully understand

00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:30.805 position:50% align:center
Blumund's intentions.

00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:33.224 position:50% align:center
I trust Rimuru, so there's no
reason to interrogate others

00:15:33.308 --> 00:15:35.185 position:50% align:center
just to satisfy
your silly doubts.

00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:36.936 position:50% align:center
Yes, so you say, Gazel.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.022 position:50% align:center
But the decision to enter
diplomatic relationships with

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:41.107 position:50% align:center
a nation of monsters is
not one that should be made

00:15:41.191 --> 00:15:42.776 position:50% align:center
on a mere whim.

00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:44.819 position:50% align:center
I daresay I've developed
a newfound respect

00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:46.988 position:50% align:center
for the king of
Blumund after this.

00:15:47.072 --> 00:15:48.865 position:50% align:center
Gah. Yes, I'm sure.

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:51.201 position:50% align:center
As if your own decision wasn't
already made from the moment

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:53.286 position:50% align:center
you stepped foot
into this country.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.206 position:50% align:center
And pray tell, Erald,
what would that be?

00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:59.334 position:50% align:center
You're right that I've reached
my own personal decision.

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:02.253 position:50% align:center
But before I tell anyone...

00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:04.798 position:50% align:center
...may I ask you just
one more question?

00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:05.882 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Hmm?

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:07.801 position:50% align:center
Enough, Dad! Ugh!

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:11.888 position:50% align:center
Stop with the stupid airs
and just answer him already!

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.973 position:50% align:center
Hey, now, Princess,
let up a little bit, okay?

00:16:14.057 --> 00:16:15.392 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Kaval's right!

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:17.352 position:50% align:center
Your father is doing his best
to properly represent

00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:18.978 position:50% align:center
his country and stuff!

00:16:19.062 --> 00:16:20.146 position:50% align:center
[ERALD groans]

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.233 position:50% align:center
Ah, how the mighty
tactician has fallen.

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:25.068 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU sighs]

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:30.323 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:16:30.407 --> 00:16:33.785 position:50% align:center
I'm listening. Go on, Erald.

00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:35.662 position:50% align:center
[ERALD]
The Demon Lord aura.

00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:38.998 position:50% align:center
I see now. It's more
intense than I thought.

00:16:39.082 --> 00:16:43.211 position:50% align:center
All right, Demon Lord Rimuru.
Let me ask you this.

00:16:43.294 --> 00:16:45.338 position:50% align:center
Please answer truthfully:

00:16:45.422 --> 00:16:49.134 position:50% align:center
What do you intend to do with
your powers as a Demon Lord?

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:50.593 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Uh?

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:52.804 position:50% align:center
Hold up. Are you for serious?

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:54.472 position:50% align:center
Yes, absolutely.

00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:56.141 position:50% align:center
The answer's pretty simple.

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:58.476 position:50% align:center
I want to create a world
that's comfortable to live in,

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.354 position:50% align:center
one that I can enjoy
being a part of.

00:17:01.438 --> 00:17:03.815 position:50% align:center
A prosperous world where
as many people as possible

00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:05.567 position:50% align:center
can always be smiling.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.403 position:50% align:center
And you believe you can
create a world like that?

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:10.739 position:50% align:center
Can you really bring
such a thing to fruition?

00:17:10.822 --> 00:17:12.907 position:50% align:center
That's what it means
to have power.

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:15.452 position:50% align:center
Ideals without power
are just a joke.

00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:17.829 position:50% align:center
And power
without ideals is empty.

00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:19.372 position:50% align:center
[ERALD gasps]

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:22.834 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:27.380 position:50% align:center
Delightful! You are absolutely
delightful, Demon Lord Rimuru!

00:17:27.464 --> 00:17:29.549 position:50% align:center
A Demon Lord versed in karma.

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:32.135 position:50% align:center
I think I'm finally starting to
understand why it was so easy

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:34.346 position:50% align:center
for you to awaken as one.

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:39.351 position:50% align:center
Forgive my rudeness,
Demon Lord Rimuru.

00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:41.770 position:50% align:center
Effective immediately and
as the Sorcerous Dynasty

00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:43.938 position:50% align:center
of Thalion's official emissary,

00:17:44.022 --> 00:17:46.399 position:50% align:center
I request the establishment
of diplomatic relations

00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:48.401 position:50% align:center
with the Jura
Tempest Federation.

00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:50.445 position:50% align:center
If you accept, my nation
would be grateful

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
for your favorable reply.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.198 position:50% align:center
Dad!

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.825 position:50% align:center
--[gasps] Hey!
--Wait!

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:08.505 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Thing is, I was hoping
to build a good relationship

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:10.882 position:50% align:center
with you, too.

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:14.094 position:50% align:center
So let's do it.
We accept your offer.

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:35.949 position:50% align:center
[GOBTA chuckles weakly]

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:40.662 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] And so, diplomatic
relations were established

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:43.665 position:50% align:center
between Tempest and the
Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion.

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:47.252 position:50% align:center
Altogether, Tempest now had
three human nations as allies,

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:49.713 position:50% align:center
including Blumund and Dwargon.

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:51.006 position:50% align:center
Okay, Benimaru?

00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:52.424 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:18:52.507 --> 00:18:54.551 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Our enemy is Clayman.
We're gonna crush him.

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:57.095 position:50% align:center
Those are orders I've
been eager to hear, my lord.

00:18:57.178 --> 00:18:59.597 position:50% align:center
All right! This is
my kind of fun!

00:18:59.681 --> 00:19:02.058 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. As for you
Three Beastketeers

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:03.309 position:50% align:center
and other warriors...

00:19:03.393 --> 00:19:04.561 position:50% align:center
No need to say it.

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:06.646 position:50% align:center
We are now under your
command, Lord Rimuru.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.356 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you can depend on us.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.357 position:50% align:center
[PHOBIO]
Mm.

00:19:09.441 --> 00:19:11.443 position:50% align:center
Wait, Rimuru. This foe...

00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:13.528 position:50% align:center
Are you certain you can win?

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center
I am. The dude's
really pissed me off.

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:18.700 position:50% align:center
My, you make it sound so simple.

00:19:18.783 --> 00:19:21.786 position:50% align:center
But Clayman is a Demon Lord with
many different types of majin

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:23.121 position:50% align:center
under his command.

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:25.206 position:50% align:center
You mustn't be careless
with this one.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.418 position:50% align:center
That doesn't mean anything.
We've got quality over quantity.

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:29.669 position:50% align:center
Feel me?

00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:31.921 position:50% align:center
Goodness gracious.
I do believe I just heard

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:35.675 position:50% align:center
the sound of my
common sense shattering.

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:37.385 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] With that,
our meeting between

00:19:37.469 --> 00:19:39.763 position:50% align:center
the humans and monsters ended.

00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:42.182 position:50% align:center
In that moment,
we took another big step

00:19:42.265 --> 00:19:44.726 position:50% align:center
toward our ultimate ideal.

00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:53.610 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE] I heard a nasty
rumor that you're gonna

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:55.820 position:50% align:center
invade Eurazania.

00:19:56.988 --> 00:19:58.114 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:19:58.198 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center
Milim may have
wiped out its capital,

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:03.453 position:50% align:center
but the country still has
a massive population.

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:05.538 position:50% align:center
What's more, is the settlements
scattered throughout it

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:08.083 position:50% align:center
are home to many
humans, as well.

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:10.043 position:50% align:center
It's those particular
settlements that will serve as

00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:12.962 position:50% align:center
the perfect sacrifices
for my awakening.

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:14.714 position:50% align:center
Don't you agree, Laplace?

00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:18.134 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE] He's talking
about total slaughter,

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:20.136 position:50% align:center
including the civilians!

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.430 position:50% align:center
Seems a bit heavy-handed
if you ask me.

00:20:22.514 --> 00:20:25.892 position:50% align:center
Panicked isn't a flattering look
for you, Clayman.

00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:28.728 position:50% align:center
Say, there's no need to do
anything rash right before

00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:31.564 position:50% align:center
a big event like
Walpurgis, is there?

00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:34.526 position:50% align:center
Also, I thought the Demon Lords
had some kind of mutual

00:20:34.609 --> 00:20:35.944 position:50% align:center
non-aggression pact?

00:20:36.027 --> 00:20:38.780 position:50% align:center
Ah, that won't be a problem.

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:42.117 position:50% align:center
You see, Mjurran the Medicine
Master was killed by that slime.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.452 position:50% align:center
It was obviously his way of
threatening me in an attempt

00:20:44.536 --> 00:20:48.039 position:50% align:center
to steal my position as
a Demon Lord and clearly,

00:20:48.123 --> 00:20:51.084 position:50% align:center
Demon Lord Carrion
instigated him to do so.

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:53.169 position:50% align:center
That's what I'm going
to tell them, anyway.

00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:56.881 position:50% align:center
I see. It makes sense if one
of them betrayed you first--

00:20:56.965 --> 00:21:00.010 position:50% align:center
Uh! Wait, did you say
Mjurran's been killed?!

00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:02.721 position:50% align:center
Indeed, I heard everything
through Marionette Heart,

00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:04.973 position:50% align:center
it was a terrible shame, really.

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:08.226 position:50% align:center
The heart I gave her was
disintegrated to ashes.

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:11.479 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE] Too bad.
She was such a nice girl.

00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:14.899 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
You are quite kind, Laplace.

00:21:14.983 --> 00:21:16.860 position:50% align:center
Tear told me something recently.

00:21:16.943 --> 00:21:19.237 position:50% align:center
She said you told her it's
important to use one's tools

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.572 position:50% align:center
with care, yes?

00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:23.867 position:50% align:center
I find that to be a rather
interesting sentiment.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.535 position:50% align:center
And I tend to agree.

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:27.871 position:50% align:center
Which is exactly why
the one who broke my tool

00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:30.832 position:50% align:center
must be held accountable
for their actions.

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:32.375 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
Hey, Clayman.

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:37.005 position:50% align:center
This plan of yours, are you sure
that it was only your idea?

00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:39.299 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN] Only a few people
can give me orders,

00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:42.052 position:50% align:center
like Kazalim or the
one I'm indebted to.

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:43.803 position:50% align:center
You of all creatures
should understand that

00:21:43.887 --> 00:21:45.638 position:50% align:center
better than anyone.

00:21:45.722 --> 00:21:49.309 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE] Yes, of course.
Never mind, then.

00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:50.643 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna head out,

00:21:50.727 --> 00:21:53.938 position:50% align:center
but as a friend, let me
give you one last warning.

00:21:54.022 --> 00:21:57.650 position:50% align:center
Don't overestimate your control
over Demon Lord Milim.

00:21:57.734 --> 00:21:59.736 position:50% align:center
Remember, she's one of
the ancient Demon Lords

00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:03.448 position:50% align:center
who was around even
before President Kazalim.

00:22:03.531 --> 00:22:05.617 position:50% align:center
I'd be careful around her.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.118 position:50% align:center
See ya.

00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:15.460 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
Was Laplace actually suggesting

00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:19.130 position:50% align:center
that I'm being controlled
by someone else?

00:22:19.214 --> 00:22:21.341 position:50% align:center
Damn that clown!
