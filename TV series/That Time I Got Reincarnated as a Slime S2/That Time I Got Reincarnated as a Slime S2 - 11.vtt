What sort of madness is this?!
What are we going to do?!

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.814 position:50% align:center
Try to stay calm, Your Highness!
that's all we can do!

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.358 position:50% align:center
Is King Edmaris safe?!

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:08.443 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?!
Protect the king!

[EDMARIS]
Oh, Folgen!

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:16.493 position:50% align:center
Hurry! We have to
get out of here right now!

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:19.496 position:50% align:center
This is madness!
We must retreat immediately!

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.040 position:50% align:center
I concur. We've no idea
what's happening.

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:23.458 position:50% align:center
If we don't leave at once,

00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:25.543 position:50% align:center
then it's likely
we'll be slain, as well.

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:28.254 position:50% align:center
Shogo? You seem different.

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:30.465 position:50% align:center
Because I'm now Razen, sir.

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:32.133 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, of course!

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:33.551 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness you're here--

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:36.513 position:50% align:center
you can use your teleportation
magic to take us back

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.098 position:50% align:center
to our kingdom!

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:40.266 position:50% align:center
[SHOGO (RAZEN)] Unfortunately,
Anti-Magic Area is in effect,

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.601 position:50% align:center
so I cannot do that.

00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:43.186 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
So we're trapped?!

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:44.479 position:50% align:center
What shall we do?

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:45.939 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, Your Highness.

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:47.816 position:50% align:center
Here--I have a plan.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.150 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:50.568 position:50% align:center
[FOLGEN] I will use
my unique skill, Spearhead,

00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:52.737 position:50% align:center
to force the soldiers
who are still alive outside

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:54.364 position:50% align:center
to gather together.

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:56.324 position:50% align:center
We can turn them
into living shields.

00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:58.243 position:50% align:center
They'll protect you
while you both escape.

00:01:58.326 --> 00:02:01.538 position:50% align:center
[EDMARIS] Ah... Brilliant!
Well done, Folgen!

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.456 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad we can rely on you!

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.125 position:50% align:center
[FOLGEN]
I'll go assemble everyone.

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:07.293 position:50% align:center
Please begin
preparations to retreat.

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:09.087 position:50% align:center
Yes, understood!

We're dead!

00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:20.682 position:50% align:center
We're... as good as dead!

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:22.892 position:50% align:center
No... I don't understand
how any of this

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.812 position:50% align:center
can actually be happening!
It's impossible!

What's that?

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:41.077 position:50% align:center
It can't be!

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.378 position:50% align:center
[SHOGO (RAZEN)] You're the
monster ruler. Aren't you?

00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:52.505 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Your body
appears to be Japanese.

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:55.508 position:50% align:center
Are you the Otherworlder
who attacked us?

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:58.803 position:50% align:center
On the outside,
but not the inside.

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:02.557 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Hmm... Well, either
way, you're still an enemy.

00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:07.395 position:50% align:center
--[EDMARIS screams] No!
--[REYHEIM whimpering]

Now Razen is dead, too!

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:11.107 position:50% align:center
[EDMARIS] It was
a mistake to mess with

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:14.611 position:50% align:center
the nation of monsters!
What do I do?

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.946 position:50% align:center
How can I survive?

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.699 position:50% align:center
Hold on. This might
be my chance!

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:23.203 position:50% align:center
After all, this fool gladly made
a deal with a small country

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:24.537 position:50% align:center
like Blumund.

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:27.540 position:50% align:center
So if I, the king of
a great nation like Falmuth,

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:31.336 position:50% align:center
offered a proposal
he'd probably be overjoyed!

Hmph.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.264 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE]
Confirmed.

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:45.934 position:50% align:center
The acquisition of the
unique skill "Merciless."

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:48.061 position:50% align:center
Successful.

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:50.897 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Merciless?
What the heck is that?

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.401 position:50% align:center
Wait! You are the leader of
the monster nation, correct?

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:59.447 position:50% align:center
My name is Edmaris.
Ruler of the Kingdom of Falmuth!

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:03.034 position:50% align:center
Stand down!
I wish to speak with you!

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:06.037 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU sighs]
Are you his double or what?

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:07.997 position:50% align:center
No need to freak out--
I don't have any plans to kill

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.582 position:50% align:center
the real king.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.626 position:50% align:center
[REYHEIM] Hold on,
this man is not a double!

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.337 position:50% align:center
I am an Archbishop from
the Western Holy Church!

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:17.507 position:50% align:center
And I swear that the real king
stands before you!

Too bad I'm killing everyone

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:20.260 position:50% align:center

[REYHEIM]
Ah! Please wait, I beg of you!

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:28.101 position:50% align:center
If you'll spare no one else,
at least make me an exception!

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:30.437 position:50% align:center
My name's Archbishop Reyheim
and I'm rather influential

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.313 position:50% align:center
when it comes to
the church's ear!

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:34.566 position:50% align:center
And if you'll only let me live,
I'll assure them

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:36.860 position:50% align:center
your nation of monsters
is no threat to humans!

Stop right there!

Did you not hear my request
to speak with you?!

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.826 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Fine, then.
I guess I'll hear you out.

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.286 position:50% align:center
[EDMARIS]
Such insolence!

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:49.914 position:50% align:center
How dare you speak to
the king of Falmuth that way?!

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:52.167 position:50% align:center
You're a creature that
normally wouldn't even have

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
the ability to speak, and--

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.629 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:58.214 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Enough.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.008 position:50% align:center
You will not belittle me again.

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:04.012 position:50% align:center
You get one pass, but choose
your next words carefully.

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:06.681 position:50% align:center
Hey, now! You misunderstand me!

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:08.183 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
How so?

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:11.311 position:50% align:center
[EDMARIS] Uh, I only came
to establish friendly relations!

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:13.521 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] No, you declared
war on my nation.

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:15.273 position:50% align:center
Do you really think
I'm that stupid?

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:17.942 position:50% align:center
My comrades fell victim
to your soldiers.

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:20.612 position:50% align:center
That makes you my enemy.

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:22.989 position:50% align:center
Only because the Western
Holy Church claimed

00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:24.491 position:50% align:center
monsters were hostile.

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:27.243 position:50% align:center
I wanted to see for myself
whether we could establish

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.204 position:50% align:center
friendly relations with them!

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:31.998 position:50% align:center
And the declaration of war
was just the Otherworlders

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:35.001 position:50% align:center
going on a rampage!
So. You see?

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:37.962 position:50% align:center
Now we can enter
into diplomatic relations!

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:41.091 position:50% align:center
Doesn't that sound good?
Are you not honored?

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:43.009 position:50% align:center
This is a big day for you!

00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:45.804 position:50% align:center
However. I will require
compensation for the losses...

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:47.972 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Oh,, wow. What a genius.

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:50.517 position:50% align:center
It almost feels like
he's trying to piss me off.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.976 position:50% align:center
[EDMARIS]
...sound fair?

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:55.605 position:50% align:center

[GREAT SAGE]
Notice:

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:08.451 position:50% align:center
Analysis of the unique skill
"Merciless" is now complete.

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:11.788 position:50% align:center
It gives its user the ability to
seize control of those who plead

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:14.290 position:50% align:center
for their lives or seek aid.

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:15.709 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Meaning?

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.419 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE] Should the target
lose its will to fight

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:20.714 position:50% align:center
in the face of this skill,
it will mean their death.

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:23.383 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I see.
And the required souls?

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:25.260 position:50% align:center
Do I have what I need?

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:30.598 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE] You have acquired
57.235% of the required number.

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:33.101 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
That little? Well, then...

00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:42.652 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I've gained a new skill.

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:45.155 position:50% align:center
I doubt I'll have
many chances to use it.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:47.407 position:50% align:center
Might as well see
what it's capable of.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.825 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE]
Question.

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:52.078 position:50% align:center
Would you like to use
the unique skill "Merciless"?

00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:53.705 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Yes.

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:02.005 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE] Through the use
of the unique skill "Merciless,"

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:04.007 position:50% align:center
you have harvested the
souls of all the humans

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.176 position:50% align:center
within the immediate area.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.762 position:50% align:center
However, the individuals
called Edmaris and Reyheim

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:10.722 position:50% align:center
are excluded as targets.

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:14.100 position:50% align:center

Seems merciless to me.

You cast Anti-Magic Area?
Why seal your greatest strength?

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:35.578 position:50% align:center
Everyone knows magic is a
demon's biggest asset in battle!

00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:37.038 position:50% align:center
Perhaps.

00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:39.582 position:50% align:center
Please feel free to try any
physical attacks you like.

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:41.292 position:50% align:center
[SHOGO (RAZEN)] Tch.
Ridiculous, it doesn't matter

00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:42.794 position:50% align:center
if you're an Archdemon!

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:46.715 position:50% align:center
As long as you can't
use magic, then I'll beat you!

00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:49.426 position:50% align:center
Unique skill: Berserker!

00:16:55.098 --> 00:16:57.559 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:16:57.642 --> 00:16:58.685 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:05.775 position:50% align:center
[SHOGO (RAZEN) gasps]
Those golden eyes...

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.610 position:50% align:center
The red pupils...

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:12.365 position:50% align:center
[SHOGO (RAZEN) snarls]

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:15.285 position:50% align:center
[SHOGO (RAZEN) grunts]

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:20.248 position:50% align:center
[SHOGO (RAZEN)] Tch. I've never
felt strength like this before.

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:22.959 position:50% align:center
It can't be... Are you...

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:25.045 position:50% align:center
Are you the one
from the legends...?

00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:27.172 position:50% align:center
The Primordial...?

00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:29.299 position:50% align:center
Oh my. You are well-learned.

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:32.135 position:50% align:center
That must mean I'm dealing
with someone quite clever.

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:35.138 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Their ruler has no idea.

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:36.389 position:50% align:center
He has no clue
that he's released

00:17:36.473 --> 00:17:40.518 position:50% align:center
such a horrific monstrosity
upon this world!

00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:43.188 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:44.939 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:17:45.023 --> 00:17:48.485 position:50% align:center
[whimpering continues]

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:51.279 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear. Have you
realized it's over?

00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:53.365 position:50% align:center
[SHOGO (RAZEN) whimpering]

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.952 position:50% align:center
[rasping]

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:02.499 position:50% align:center
Oops.

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:05.543 position:50% align:center
Well, then. I suppose
I have completed my task.

00:18:05.627 --> 00:18:10.298 position:50% align:center
Meaning... I will most certainly
earn praise from my new master.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.402 position:50% align:center
[WORLD]
Notice.

00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:34.322 position:50% align:center
The individual Rimuru Tempest's
Harvest Festival is complete.

00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru!

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:36.533 position:50% align:center
He's evolved.

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:38.284 position:50% align:center
[WORLD] Next step:
A gift will be bestowed

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:40.537 position:50% align:center
upon those connected to him.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.996 position:50% align:center
A gift?

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.707 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.166 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA grunts]

00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:48.962 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:50.505 position:50% align:center
[GRUCIUS]
Huh...?

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:52.298 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU groans]
What is this...?

00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:54.175 position:50% align:center
This gift...

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:57.137 position:50% align:center
My connection with him...
feels stronger...

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.473 position:50% align:center
Much stronger...
than it used to be...

00:19:00.557 --> 00:19:03.685 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Must... guard... Master...

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:09.733 position:50% align:center
[GRUCIUS gasps]

00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:11.401 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU groans]

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:19.743 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.132 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU gasps]

00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:40.680 position:50% align:center
Notice. Rest easy,
I will handle everything.

00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:42.390 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU grunts]

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:52.275 position:50% align:center
He's changed.

00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:54.027 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:19:58.323 --> 00:20:02.619 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Notice. I order you
in the name of Raphael.

00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:06.456 position:50% align:center
Beelzebub, devour all
magicules within this barrier.

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:10.085 position:50% align:center
Do not leave a single
fragment of a soul behind.

00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:28.853 position:50% align:center
All the magicules...

00:20:28.937 --> 00:20:30.855 position:50% align:center
...were sucked away?

00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:33.858 position:50% align:center
Are those... spirits?

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:53.420 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--Whoa, an Archdemon!

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:58.341 position:50% align:center
[BLACK] We've delivered
the survivor, Master.

00:20:58.425 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:02.095 position:50% align:center
Pardon me, sir. Normally,
I wouldn't dare interrupt

00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:05.724 position:50% align:center
this ritual, but I
feel I must speak.

00:21:05.807 --> 00:21:07.434 position:50% align:center
It appears there aren't
enough magicules

00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:09.185 position:50% align:center
to fully revive these souls.

00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:11.479 position:50% align:center
Though I've no doubt
you're aware of that.

00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:16.151 position:50% align:center
Yes. The amount of magicules
present is insufficient.

00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:18.945 position:50% align:center
I'll use my life energy
to succeed.

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:21.322 position:50% align:center
Wait a moment, if you will.

00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:24.325 position:50% align:center
There is no need to substitute
your own life energy, my lord.

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:27.495 position:50% align:center
I've the most excellent idea.

00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:30.081 position:50% align:center
May I suggest using
these two instead?

00:21:30.165 --> 00:21:31.499 position:50% align:center
It would be their honor.

00:21:31.583 --> 00:21:34.210 position:50% align:center
Being of use to you
is all that matters to us.

00:21:34.294 --> 00:21:35.754 position:50% align:center
Please consider it.

00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:39.299 position:50% align:center
I assure you there is nothing
that would make us happier.

00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:43.261 position:50% align:center
Yes. They will augment
the current magicules.

00:21:43.345 --> 00:21:45.430 position:50% align:center
I accept your proposal.

00:21:45.513 --> 00:21:47.223 position:50% align:center
Beelzebub.

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:55.732 position:50% align:center
Oh. How I envy them...

00:22:01.112 --> 00:22:03.907 position:50% align:center
[BLACK]
Ah! Forgive me, sir.

00:22:09.579 --> 00:22:12.499 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] The required amount
of magicules has been fulfilled.

00:22:12.582 --> 00:22:15.960 position:50% align:center
Beginning the Secret Art
of Spirit Resurrection.

00:22:18.713 --> 00:22:20.256 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Appraisal.

00:22:24.886 --> 00:22:28.056 position:50% align:center
I don't believe it.
This is the ultimate art!

00:22:28.139 --> 00:22:29.265 position:50% align:center
There's no way...

00:22:29.349 --> 00:22:31.726 position:50% align:center
A newborn Demon Lord
can do this?

00:22:34.688 --> 00:22:37.315 position:50% align:center
[GRUCIUS] Even Lord Carrion
couldn't perform this.

00:22:38.858 --> 00:22:40.360 position:50% align:center
Magnificent...

00:22:40.443 --> 00:22:41.903 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:22:41.986 --> 00:22:45.323 position:50% align:center
[BLACK] I must be accepted as
his subordinate at any cost.

00:22:47.158 --> 00:22:48.493 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Reviving the dead,

00:22:48.576 --> 00:22:51.538 position:50% align:center
AKA Secret Art of
Spirit Resurrection.

00:22:51.621 --> 00:22:54.124 position:50% align:center
Carrying it out requires an
absolutely insane amount

00:22:54.207 --> 00:22:57.210 position:50% align:center
of magicules. And the magic
needed to control them

00:22:57.293 --> 00:22:59.462 position:50% align:center
surpasses the imagination.

00:23:00.588 --> 00:23:04.175 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] The probability
of success is 3.14%.

00:23:04.259 --> 00:23:07.595 position:50% align:center
But that number was calculated
before I completed my evolution

00:23:07.679 --> 00:23:09.514 position:50% align:center
and became a Demon Lord.

00:23:11.725 --> 00:23:14.310 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Now that
the process is complete...

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:56.519 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Next time, "The One Unleashed."
