[SOLDIER 34A] I heard some of
those monsters are real lookers.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.353 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 34B] Heck yeah,
first come, first served.

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:03.229 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 34C] Women are great,
but I heard the place

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:04.564 position:50% align:center
is loaded with treasure.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:05.398 position:50% align:center
--[SOLDIER 34A] Seriously?
--[SOLDIER 34B] Really?

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:06.733 position:50% align:center
[Should be pretty fun.

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:08.443 position:50% align:center
Sounds exciting.
[slurps]

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:09.736 position:50% align:center
--[FOLGEN] You there.
--[BOTH] Hmm?

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:11.654 position:50% align:center
I hate to intrude on
your little daydreams,

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:14.032 position:50% align:center
but you should take this
time to try and rest.

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:15.116 position:50% align:center
Once you're done eating,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.160 position:50% align:center
we will resume our march
towards Tempest.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:19.954 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks for stating the obvious.

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:21.373 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:35.095 position:50% align:center
These are the guys who
killed Shion and the rest.

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:38.515 position:50% align:center
At least there's no need
to grant them forgiveness.

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:41.351 position:50% align:center
You're all nothing more
than my fodder.

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:43.770 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:47.023 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Let's do this.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:22.327 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 34A gasps]
Hey. Someone's there!

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.661 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 34B gasps]

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:27.248 position:50% align:center
All knights!
Get ready for combat!

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:28.416 position:50% align:center
--[KNIGHTS yell]
--Halt!

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.418 position:50% align:center
Come any closer,
and we will show no mercy!

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:34.464 position:50% align:center
No, I'm the one who won't
be showing mercy. Apologies.

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:38.009 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, you're about
to take the brunt of my fury.

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:43.723 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 34B, 34C growl]

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:52.315 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHTS yelling]

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:55.652 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Nobody warned me
that there would be

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:57.821 position:50% align:center
any monsters this deadly.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.042 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Hmph!

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:17.340 position:50% align:center
Mission accomplished.

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:21.803 position:50% align:center
Now then, surely no one is
pitiful enough to need my help?

00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:24.597 position:50% align:center
[GABIRU laughs]
Dragonewt warriors!

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.599 position:50% align:center
Follow my lead, to glory!

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:27.934 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Knights!

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:29.185 position:50% align:center
--[KNIGHTS gasping]
--[KNIGHT 34E growls] Quick!

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:32.272 position:50% align:center
Assume your positions!
It's an aerial attack!

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:35.483 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 34D] Whoa! Dragonewts?!
There're so many!

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50% align:center
I'm the one known as Gabiru!
Remember me well, humans!

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.490 position:50% align:center
For I'm the last
creature you'll meet.

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:44.409 position:50% align:center

[GABIRU grunts]

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.376 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 34F]
Hmm? Ah!

00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:59.007 position:50% align:center
[SOKA] Master Souei.
Please forgive us.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.633 position:50% align:center
We thought our foes
would be stronger.

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:03.428 position:50% align:center
As a result, our attacks
lacked moderation.

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:05.180 position:50% align:center
[SOUEI]
So it would seem.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.601 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru's
calculations were correct.

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:11.561 position:50% align:center
The Otherworlders
are in the west.

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:12.937 position:50% align:center
A shame.

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:21.237 position:50% align:center
Tch. Hey! Have any
of those monsters

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:22.947 position:50% align:center
tried to flee the city yet?

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:25.158 position:50% align:center
There has been no sign
of the enemy again today.

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:26.409 position:50% align:center
Damn!

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:29.329 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Just have
a little patience, Shogo.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:31.373 position:50% align:center
We've had no contact
from the other camps.

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:34.000 position:50% align:center
If anyone tries to run,
this road is the only way.

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:36.878 position:50% align:center
[SHOGO] Tch. Yeah,
I sure hope you're right.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.965 position:50% align:center
Because this fist of mine is
itching to cause some mayhem.

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:44.135 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Believe it or not,
I feel the same way.

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:48.098 position:50% align:center
[KYOYA] There's nothing more
satisfying than the sensation

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:51.351 position:50% align:center
of cutting through someone
who is full of self-confidence.

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.978 position:50% align:center
It's so glorious.
[slurps]

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:56.022 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Enemies are approaching!

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:57.482 position:50% align:center
--[SHOGO chuckles]
--[KYOYA] Hmph.

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:59.359 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 34H]
There appear to be...

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:01.820 position:50% align:center
Uh, four of them.

00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:11.287 position:50% align:center
[SHOGO]
Really? That's it? Tch.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:14.708 position:50% align:center
[KYOYA] Huh? Looks like
the old geezer is still alive.

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.126 position:50% align:center
Hmph.

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:23.299 position:50% align:center
Now, Rigur.
Let's give 'em a show!

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.927 position:50% align:center
'Kay. Keep up with me, Gobta!

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:35.895 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.856 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHTS groaning]

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.608 position:50% align:center
Unholy arts...?
These are truly God's enemies!

00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:41.943 position:50% align:center

[KNIGHTS yelling]

00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:02.172 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 34L grunts]
Agh!

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:03.673 position:50% align:center
Agh--!

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:08.386 position:50% align:center
[laughs] What do you know?
They're better than I imagined.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.639 position:50% align:center
I'm interested. I don't mind
taking these guys on.

00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:13.099 position:50% align:center
Wow! You mean it, Master Shogo?

00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:14.768 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 34P]
Thank you!

00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:23.276 position:50% align:center
Look who showed up. The guy
who helped kill everyone.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.527 position:50% align:center
But...

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.821 position:50% align:center
...I'm not the one
you'll be fighting today.

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:29.324 position:50% align:center
[GELD]
Rest assured, Gobta.

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:32.285 position:50% align:center
I will most certainly
crush this human flat.

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:34.162 position:50% align:center
Right, I'm counting
on you, Geld.

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:37.707 position:50% align:center
He may have looked kinda goofy,
but Gobzo was a really good guy.

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:40.085 position:50% align:center
[GELD]
Hmm.

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:41.753 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:43.046 position:50% align:center
[snarls]

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:44.756 position:50% align:center
[GELD gasps]

00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:52.138 position:50% align:center
[KYOYA]
You actually managed to survive.

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:55.183 position:50% align:center
Too bad you're not intelligent
enough to stay away.

00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:57.435 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
Despite my age,

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:59.813 position:50% align:center
I actually have
a competitive streak.

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:01.606 position:50% align:center
Not to mention...

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.525 position:50% align:center
...it displeases me to see
an impudent whelp

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:05.694 position:50% align:center
act so high and mighty.

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:08.780 position:50% align:center
[KYOYA] Oh? You're not
referring to me, are you?

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:10.490 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU]
Was that not obvious?

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:12.409 position:50% align:center
I should have
spoken more clearly.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.661 position:50% align:center
I apologize, for some
reason, I assumed your brains

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:16.913 position:50% align:center
were at a higher level
than your personality.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:20.834 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I see being cut down
hasn't dulled your spirit.

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.168 position:50% align:center
Or maybe...

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:24.087 position:50% align:center
...you're just senile.

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:32.554 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:36.057 position:50% align:center
That was easy.
Best watch that temper of yours.

00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:37.392 position:50% align:center
Although, I'm not much better,

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.144 position:50% align:center
as it seems I have just
about reached the limit

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.687 position:50% align:center
of my own patience.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.480 position:50% align:center
[KYOYA gasps, grunts]

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:46.401 position:50% align:center
Don't make me laugh.

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:49.362 position:50% align:center
You couldn't even touch me
the last time we crossed swords!

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:51.281 position:50% align:center
Your tough act doesn't scare me!

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:55.243 position:50% align:center
True. But it was your power,
not skill, that won the fight.

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:57.328 position:50% align:center
You possess
the spatial attribute.

00:08:57.412 --> 00:08:59.622 position:50% align:center
Oh? I'm surprised
you could tell.

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:01.124 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU] Now that I know
your silly tricks,

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.208 position:50% align:center
I can deal with them.

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:03.752 position:50% align:center
[KYOYA]
Yes, how fascinating.

00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:05.378 position:50% align:center
In that case, why don't
we settle this dispute

00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:08.381 position:50% align:center
with our swords,
fair and square?

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:11.176 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU]
Very well.

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:12.385 position:50% align:center
Heh!

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:16.556 position:50% align:center
[KYOYA]
Right. Get ready.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.684 position:50% align:center
Heh!

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:27.734 position:50% align:center
[cackles] I can't believe you
fell for my trick, old man!

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:41.039 position:50% align:center
[KYOYA gasps]
There's no way...

00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:42.665 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU chuckles]
To think you would use

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:45.168 position:50% align:center
such a ridiculous sneak attack.

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:47.796 position:50% align:center
I severely overestimated
your skill level.

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:50.006 position:50% align:center
[KYOYA]
Shut up! What'd you even do?!

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.592 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU] What's wrong?
You mean you didn't see it?

00:09:52.676 --> 00:09:55.679 position:50% align:center
I guess you really are just
a second-rate swordsman.

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.180 position:50% align:center
What'd you say...?

00:09:57.263 --> 00:10:00.058 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry--I meant less
than second-rate.

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:01.768 position:50% align:center
Don't talk down to me...

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:03.311 position:50% align:center
...stupid old geezer!

00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:05.522 position:50% align:center
Then allow me to demonstrate
the true essence of

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:07.357 position:50% align:center
a skilled swordsman.

00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:11.653 position:50% align:center
Now watch me closely,
if you can.

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:13.822 position:50% align:center
[KYOYA] Quiet!
You'll regret insulting me,

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:15.532 position:50% align:center
you coffin-dodger!

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:22.080 position:50% align:center
[KYOYA snarls]

00:10:23.707 --> 00:10:26.418 position:50% align:center
[KYOYA] Heh! There's
nothing that can save you!

00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:29.045 position:50% align:center
My extra skill, All-Seeing Eye,
detects motion around me

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:31.423 position:50% align:center
at 300 times the normal speed!

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:35.385 position:50% align:center
It makes a walking carcass like
you appear to be standing still!

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:37.637 position:50% align:center
This time,
I'll kill you for real!

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:40.724 position:50% align:center
No, you actually
can't see anything yet.

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:43.018 position:50% align:center
[KYOYA]
Huh...?

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:45.353 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, my body's
movements should be catching up

to your All-Seeing
Eye momentarily.

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:50.025 position:50% align:center
Wait. They are?

[HAKUROU]
Crestwater Slash!

My body won't move.

00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:59.826 position:50% align:center
No, it can't move!

What....? What?!

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.710 position:50% align:center
[KYOYA] No...
My Thought Acceleration.

It's still active!

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:17.052 position:50% align:center
It's all over for you.

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:22.057 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU] Use that extended
time your ability gives you

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:26.561 position:50% align:center

the evil deeds you've committed.

[SHOGO growls]

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:46.039 position:50% align:center
That was cheap! A real man
would fight with his bare hands!

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:49.793 position:50% align:center
That doesn't make sense.
We're fighting in a war, son.

00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:51.044 position:50% align:center
There is no "cheap."

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:52.879 position:50% align:center
It's disgraceful to your
opponent if you don't

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:54.964 position:50% align:center
utilize all your strengths.

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:56.549 position:50% align:center
[SHOGO]
Don't give me that garbage!

00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:59.260 position:50% align:center
Aren't you ashamed to be
fighting me in full armor?!

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:01.680 position:50% align:center
[GELD]
You really aren't making sense.

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:04.057 position:50% align:center
I tried. Fine, whatever.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.184 position:50% align:center
I guess I was hoping you'd
ditch that pesky shield,

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:08.228 position:50% align:center
but just forget I said
anything, okay?

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:10.188 position:50% align:center
More importantly,
I'm finally warmed up,

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:13.108 position:50% align:center
so I guess it's time to start
taking this fight seriously!

Hmm.

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:23.702 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna face you for real
this time, so do me a favor

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:26.871 position:50% align:center
and put up a decent
fight, got it?

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:28.331 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

Can't move in all that armor?!

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:43.430 position:50% align:center
[chcukles]
Ugh--

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:45.974 position:50% align:center
Ah! What the hell?!

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:51.813 position:50% align:center
Ah! Ugh! Damn... you...!

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:53.648 position:50% align:center
[GELD] Your ability to
strengthen your body

00:12:53.732 --> 00:12:55.400 position:50% align:center
--is impressive.
--[SHOGO screaming]

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:58.319 position:50% align:center

still be weak against my Rot.

[SHOGO growls]
Wait, you have a Rot skill?!

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.700 position:50% align:center
Damn you, stupid pig!
[screams]

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.452 position:50% align:center
[GELD]
I'll end your suffering.

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:06.995 position:50% align:center
[SHOGO gasps]
Wait, hold on!

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:08.788 position:50% align:center
Please, show mercy!

00:13:10.749 --> 00:13:12.625 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU] You still
aren't done here, Geld?

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:13.960 position:50% align:center
[GELD]
Hmm?

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:17.756 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I was just
about to finish him.

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:20.717 position:50% align:center
Damn it all!
What's Kyoya even doing?!

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
Oh, if you're talking
about your friend, he's here.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.140 position:50% align:center

Why is this happening to me?!

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:39.194 position:50% align:center
Am I really gonna die?!

[KIRARA]
Hmm? Wha...? Now what?

00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:55.919 position:50% align:center
Why is it so stupid
loud out there?

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:58.713 position:50% align:center
I was just having the best
dream about the past, too.

00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:00.465 position:50% align:center
I was in Harajuku
with my friends,

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:01.591 position:50% align:center
--and we were out shopping--
--Yeah look,

00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:02.592 position:50% align:center
I really don't care.

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:03.593 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Hmm?

00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:07.013 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Kirara. Time to die.

00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:10.350 position:50% align:center
Huh? Are you jok--

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:11.393 position:50% align:center
[SHOGO]
Heh!

Truly the work of a savage.

00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:28.785 position:50% align:center
This is the lowest one can fall.

00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:31.413 position:50% align:center
[GELD] We shall spare
no pity on your behalf.

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:33.081 position:50% align:center
For you are not a warrior.

00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:35.834 position:50% align:center
[SHOGO]
Shut up. I wanted to live!

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:37.085 position:50% align:center
Did you hear that?

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:39.587 position:50% align:center
The Words of the World
spoke to me in there.

00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:41.923 position:50% align:center
It said that in exchange
for Kirara's soul,

00:14:42.007 --> 00:14:45.093 position:50% align:center
I've acquired the unique
Survivor skill. Cool, huh?

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:46.845 position:50% align:center
He heard the Words of the World.

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:50.974 position:50% align:center
I think I understand now--his
goal was to acquire a new power.

[GELD] Lord Rimuru
says killing one's allies

my bones or cut off my head,

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:25.925 position:50% align:center
but I'll regenerate instantly!

the slightest chance!

There's no need.

take me on alone, fatso?

That's gutsy.

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:44.486 position:50% align:center

hand-to-hand, right?

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:46.613 position:50% align:center
I'd like to see what you can do.

00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:48.156 position:50% align:center

That's unfortunate, it was
foolish of me to underestimate

You're here to save me?!

stands before us.

He is unbelievably strong.

couldn't win against him.

You saw right through the trap.

Perhaps you are the opponent
I should be more wary of.

You lie.

You've been wary of me from
the moment you first appeared.

It's a fine theory,
but you're wrong, Kijin.

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:13.426 position:50% align:center
Based on strength alone, it's
only natural that I would look

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.970 position:50% align:center
to the Orc Lord first.

00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:17.639 position:50% align:center
Now, please excuse me.

If we both stay alive, I'm sure
we'll meet on the battlefield--

We will not.

our ruler is making his way
toward that very battlefield.

00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:30.235 position:50% align:center
[RAZEN]
Hmm. Your ruler?

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:33.154 position:50% align:center
Impossible. Was he not
defeated by that witch,

00:18:33.238 --> 00:18:36.324 position:50% align:center
Hinata Sakaguchi?
He still lives?

00:18:36.408 --> 00:18:39.160 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU] Little do you know
that you've gone too far.

00:18:39.244 --> 00:18:41.663 position:50% align:center
You've managed to anger
the one person whose rage

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:43.998 position:50% align:center
you should fear the most.

00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:45.583 position:50% align:center
You have my sympathy.

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:48.294 position:50% align:center
I doubt your death
will be painless.

00:18:48.378 --> 00:18:50.714 position:50% align:center
[RAZEN laughs]
Meaningless bluffs!

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:52.924 position:50% align:center
Nevertheless,
I do appreciate the warning

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:55.051 position:50% align:center
and shall do my best to heed it.

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:56.428 position:50% align:center
I bid thee farewell!

00:18:56.511 --> 00:18:57.804 position:50% align:center
[GELD grunts]

00:19:00.223 --> 00:19:03.852 position:50% align:center
[GELD] Was that wise?
We let the magic user get away.

00:19:03.935 --> 00:19:06.021 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU]
Wise? Probably not.

00:19:06.104 --> 00:19:07.480 position:50% align:center
But if we had fought
and killed him,

00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:09.858 position:50% align:center
then everyone here
might have died.

00:19:09.941 --> 00:19:11.151 position:50% align:center
[GELD gasps]

00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:13.153 position:50% align:center
It's true. You see,
he had rigged himself with

00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:16.406 position:50% align:center
nuclear strike magic, and
his death acts as the trigger.

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:17.574 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:19.200 position:50% align:center
Although I have
confidence it wouldn't be

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:20.827 position:50% align:center
a problem for Lord Rimuru.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.704 position:50% align:center

[SHUNA gasps]

00:19:45.268 --> 00:19:47.354 position:50% align:center
[SOUEI] Lord Rimuru,
all four magical devices

00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:48.730 position:50% align:center
have been destroyed.

00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:49.981 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Thank you.

00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:52.275 position:50% align:center
Please head back to town
and keep up the watch.

00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:53.735 position:50% align:center
[SOUEI]
Sir.

00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:56.404 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Great Sage.
How do things look?

00:19:56.488 --> 00:19:59.449 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE] Notice. Magic spell
calculation complete.

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:01.826 position:50% align:center
Ready to activate at any time.

00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:05.288 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Everything is ready.

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:14.464 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Now then. You can
all feel honored in knowing

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:17.717 position:50% align:center
that you had a part
in my evolution.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.517 position:50% align:center
[SHOGO grunts] Uh. Thank you,
sir. For saving me.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.185 position:50% align:center
Yes, think nothing of it.

00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:28.812 position:50% align:center
You're a precious military asset

00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:31.147 position:50% align:center
to the Kingdom of
Falmuth, Shogo.

00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:34.984 position:50% align:center
I know, and I promise you,
I'll win next time.

00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:37.570 position:50% align:center
[RAZEN]
Indeed. Look up.

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:39.197 position:50% align:center
[RAZEN] Hmm.
It appears your wounds

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.907 position:50% align:center
are already healing nicely.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.284 position:50% align:center
Most likely, it's your
new skill hard at work.

00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:44.786 position:50% align:center
You did well, Shogo.

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:48.081 position:50% align:center
But to be safe, I'll cast
another healing spell.

00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:49.416 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:52.585 position:50% align:center
[SHOGO grunts]

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:56.297 position:50% align:center
[RAZEN chuckles]

00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:58.466 position:50% align:center
[FOLGEN] You destroyed
his soul, didn't you?

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.427 position:50% align:center
Isn't this a bit
ahead of schedule?

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.053 position:50% align:center
[RAZEN]
I didn't have much choice.

00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:04.889 position:50% align:center
Shogo was no longer
of any use to our cause.

00:21:04.973 --> 00:21:06.599 position:50% align:center
I admit it's unfortunate.

00:21:06.683 --> 00:21:08.977 position:50% align:center
Additionally, we lost
Kyoya's Severer skill

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.187 position:50% align:center
and Kirara's Bewilder
skill before we could

00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:12.939 position:50% align:center
transfer them over to you.

00:21:13.023 --> 00:21:14.232 position:50% align:center
Well, no matter.

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:16.401 position:50% align:center
There will be
more opportunities.

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:19.571 position:50% align:center
With that said, this plan
of yours won't fail, will it?

00:21:19.654 --> 00:21:20.905 position:50% align:center
Don't you fret.

00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:23.283 position:50% align:center
This is not the first time
I've done this spell.

00:21:23.366 --> 00:21:25.660 position:50% align:center
To be honest, compared
to my Reincarnation,

00:21:25.744 --> 00:21:29.164 position:50% align:center
possession of a human body
is mere child's play.

00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:44.596 position:50% align:center
[FOLGEN gasps] Wait. Sir Razen,
is that truly you?

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:48.808 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Of course, is that
really so difficult to believe?

00:21:48.892 --> 00:21:50.310 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:50.393 --> 00:21:52.020 position:50% align:center
[SHOGO (RAZEN)] Do you have
any idea just how many years

00:21:52.103 --> 00:21:55.023 position:50% align:center
I have served the
Kingdom of Falmuth?

00:21:55.106 --> 00:21:56.566 position:50% align:center
It's a fair amount.

00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:59.611 position:50% align:center
With both an indomitable spirit
and a strong, capable body,

00:21:59.694 --> 00:22:03.490 position:50% align:center
I am now the most powerful
majin in Falmuth's history.

00:22:03.573 --> 00:22:06.451 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] It's a bit odd
hearing you talk like an old man

00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:08.661 position:50% align:center
when you're in Shogo's body.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.833 position:50% align:center
Now then. Let us report
to King Edmaris right away,

00:22:13.917 --> 00:22:16.503 position:50% align:center
I'm quite eager to introduce
him to my new appearance.

00:22:16.586 --> 00:22:18.004 position:50% align:center
[FOLGEN]
Mm.

00:22:18.088 --> 00:22:21.549 position:50% align:center
With this stronger body, I could
even take on a Demon Lord.

00:22:21.633 --> 00:22:23.218 position:50% align:center
[FOLGEN chuckles]

00:22:35.188 --> 00:22:37.273 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE]
Anti-Magic Area established.

00:22:37.357 --> 00:22:40.360 position:50% align:center
The enemy army
is now unable to use magic.

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:45.365 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Excellent. No one escapes.

00:22:56.751 --> 00:22:58.253 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 34R]
Huh?

00:22:58.336 --> 00:23:01.006 position:50% align:center
--[KNIGHT 34T] What the heck...
--[KNIGHT 34S] Is that... water?

00:23:03.008 --> 00:23:07.220 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Die. May the wrath
of the gods pierce you.

00:23:07.303 --> 00:23:08.972 position:50% align:center
Megiddo!

00:23:26.239 --> 00:23:29.909 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE]
Notice. 1,788 have died.

00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:32.787 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE]
1,903.

00:23:33.913 --> 00:23:36.332 position:50% align:center

2,435.

00:23:43.048 --> 00:23:45.300 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE]
2,806.

00:23:45.383 --> 00:23:47.510 position:50% align:center

00:23:47.594 --> 00:23:50.513 position:50% align:center

4,803.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:59.022 position:50% align:center
5,575.

00:23:59.105 --> 00:24:01.775 position:50% align:center
Next time,
"Birth of a Demon Lord."
