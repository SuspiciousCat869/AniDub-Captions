in tonight's meeting.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:31.865 position:50% align:center

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:01.102 position:50% align:center
[DEENO grunts]

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:04.814 position:50% align:center
[RAINE]
Harpy, The Sky Queen: Frey.

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:11.488 position:50% align:center
[RAINE] Deathman,
The Marionette Master: Clayman.

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.323 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
Hmm...

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:18.244 position:50% align:center
[RAINE] Demonoid, The Platinum
Saber: Leon Cromwell.

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:21.998 position:50% align:center
And finally, Slime,
The Leader of

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:26.711 position:50% align:center
the Jura Tempest Federation:
Rimuru Tempest.

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:31.174 position:50% align:center
[RAINE] This concludes
the introductions.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.263 position:50% align:center
I'd like to start
by thanking you all

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:39.015 position:50% align:center
for responding to my summons.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:42.060 position:50% align:center
I am truly humbled by
your presence here tonight.

00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:45.605 position:50% align:center
All right, shall we begin?
Then, without further ado,

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.816 position:50% align:center
it is my tremendous
honor to declare

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.611 position:50% align:center
the commencement of the
Demon Lords' banquet, Walpurgis.

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:00.537 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:05.000 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Clayman gave a long speech,

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:06.584 position:50% align:center
but here's the cliffnotes:

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:10.213 position:50% align:center
According to him, Demon Lord
Carrion came to visit me,

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.924 position:50% align:center
and tempted me
to become a Demon Lord.

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:15.385 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN] Demon Lord Carrion's
forces are currently holed up

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:19.556 position:50% align:center
in Tempest! Undeniable
proof of his actions!

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:26.563 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
Hmph. What's more...

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:29.190 position:50% align:center
Carrion instigated
the Kingdom of Falmuth,

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:32.068 position:50% align:center
leading them to invade
the Great Forest of Jura.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.695 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN, RIMURU]
Next, he offered to cooperate...

00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:35.905 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] ...with our people
in order to fight them off,

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.158 position:50% align:center
and caused harm
to the humans.

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.827 position:50% align:center
Then, after defeating
the Kingdom of Falmuth,

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.873 position:50% align:center
I declared myself a Demon Lord,
and Carrion gave me his backing.

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:47.208 position:50% align:center
That was his story.

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:51.004 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN] And such self-serving
behavior violates the pact

00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:53.173 position:50% align:center
made by the Demon Lords.

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:54.341 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU growls quietly]

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:55.759 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN growls]

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:59.637 position:50% align:center
You see... I know this because
my subordinate, Mjurran,

00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:02.098 position:50% align:center
who gathered this
information for me...

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:05.352 position:50% align:center
[growls] ...was killed
by this despicable fool

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:07.354 position:50% align:center
who calls himself Rimuru!

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:12.901 position:50% align:center
[sobs] Which is why I've made up
my mind to take vengeance.

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:14.486 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Wow, brilliant acting.

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.446 position:50% align:center
I think I might cry.

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:20.575 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN] To make matters
even worse, Rimuru conspired

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:23.453 position:50% align:center
with Carrion in an attempt
to end my life.

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:26.039 position:50% align:center
My dear Mjurran used
the last of her strength

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:28.208 position:50% align:center
to deliver all this information.

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:31.294 position:50% align:center
Afterwards, once she learned
of Carrion's betrayal,

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.004 position:50% align:center
Milim became enraged.

00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:35.840 position:50% align:center
She then destroyed the
Animal Kingdom of Eurazania,

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:37.884 position:50% align:center
and Carrion was killed.

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:39.678 position:50% align:center
Naturally, I admonished her.

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:41.680 position:50% align:center
I told Milim that she should
never do such a thing

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:44.599 position:50% align:center
without evidence.
That it's unforgivable.

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:47.852 position:50% align:center
However, I ask that you
don't blame Milim for this.

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:49.729 position:50% align:center
She only attacked him
for my sake.

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:52.023 position:50% align:center
She was trying to help.

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:54.567 position:50% align:center
I'm certain that you all
understand the situation.

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:57.987 position:50% align:center
It is clear that this petty
majin known as Rimuru is a fool

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.365 position:50% align:center
who gives Demon
Lords a bad name!

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:03.159 position:50% align:center
It would be in our best
interests to purge him!

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.620 position:50% align:center
That concludes my case.

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:08.957 position:50% align:center
Next on the docket,
our guest will give us

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.042 position:50% align:center
their own explanation.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.588 position:50% align:center
Your name is Clayman, right?

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:18.550 position:50% align:center
Whatever. You're a huge liar.

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:20.093 position:50% align:center
Excuse me?

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:23.096 position:50% align:center
For starters, the status of
Demon Lord is meaningless to me.

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:26.558 position:50% align:center
The thing you said about Carrion
deceiving me was absolute BS.

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.768 position:50% align:center
And the Kingdom of Falmuth
only invaded Tempest

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:30.437 position:50% align:center
out of their own greed.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.522 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN] Hah! I suppose
we should just take

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:34.065 position:50% align:center
your word for it?

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:37.027 position:50% align:center
Lest you forget, one of my
subordinates was killed!

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.154 position:50% align:center
Actually, Mjurran is alive.

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:42.949 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN growls] Wow, of all
the ludicrous statements.

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:45.201 position:50% align:center
Mjurran supposedly
testified to you,

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.037 position:50% align:center
but she's in my care.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.997 position:50% align:center
I won't allow you
to get near her.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.540 position:50% align:center
And your word alone
will never be enough

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.083 position:50% align:center
to convince anyone here.

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50% align:center
Hah, hah! So, you would really
do something that cowardly?

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:56.713 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
"Cowardly"?

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.965 position:50% align:center
Did you tamper with
Mjurran's corpse and install

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:00.884 position:50% align:center
some evil spirit inside of it?

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.761 position:50% align:center
You know, I had a weird
feeling that you wouldn't

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:04.554 position:50% align:center
believe anything I said.

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
Which is why...

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:08.558 position:50% align:center
...I brought evidence.

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.310 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN]
Hmm?!

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:12.103 position:50% align:center
[YAMZA]
No! Spare me, sir!

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:13.938 position:50% align:center
I don't want to do this!

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:16.316 position:50% align:center
Please, Lord Clayman,
I beg of you!

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:18.443 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:22.155 position:50% align:center
Wait-- What is this?!

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50% align:center
[FOOTMAN] Clayman's forces
were annihilated!

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.034 position:50% align:center
The plan has failed!

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:28.244 position:50% align:center
The losses suffered here
are far too great.

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.622 position:50% align:center
He really should have done as
he said and sat there quietly...

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:32.082 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
"Done as he said"?

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.542 position:50% align:center
Sounds like there might be
someone behind Clayman

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.002 position:50% align:center
pulling the strings.

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:38.046 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Answer: It can be
surmised that all of this

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
is connected.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.174 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU grunts]
Makes perfect sense.

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:43.510 position:50% align:center
So whatever mystery person
behind the scenes that got me

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:46.346 position:50% align:center
to fight Hinata is also
controlling Clayman.

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:50.058 position:50% align:center
That's just a little
thing I call "proof."

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:51.393 position:50% align:center
You're welcome.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:53.728 position:50% align:center
This is nothing more
than a fabrication!

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:55.980 position:50% align:center
A clever bluff that you
made using your own magic

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:57.482 position:50% align:center
to back your lies!

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:59.901 position:50% align:center
As if we'd fall
for such basic trickery.

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:01.403 position:50% align:center
You foolish slime!

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:04.114 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Hmph. Only a moron
would call it a bluff.

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.282 position:50% align:center
Your army's been
wiped out, Clayman.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:09.035 position:50% align:center
The question is,
are you ready to join them?

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:11.246 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN growls]

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:14.290 position:50% align:center
Wait, everyone. This slime
is clearly lying to you!

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.001 position:50% align:center
You mustn't succumb
to his devious words

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:17.460 position:50% align:center
or pathetic tricks!

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:20.422 position:50% align:center
He released Veldora's seal
to destroy Falmuth's army.

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:22.716 position:50% align:center
Then the slime had the
audacity to parade around

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:24.676 position:50% align:center
and pass the act off as his own!

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:25.969 position:50% align:center
Just look at him!

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:27.846 position:50% align:center
It's preposterous that
a weakling like him dares

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:29.431 position:50% align:center
--to call himself a Demon Lord!
--[DAGGRULL] Yeah.

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:30.432 position:50% align:center
Quick question.

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:31.558 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:32.892 position:50% align:center
[DAGGRULL]
Earlier, you testified that

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:35.270 position:50% align:center
this Rimuru fellow
conspired with Carrion

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:38.773 position:50% align:center
to instigate Falmuth's army
before wiping them out.

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:41.735 position:50% align:center
Assuming it's true that Veldora
is back, why would he need

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:44.696 position:50% align:center
to take such roundabout measures
in order to achieve his goal?

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:47.365 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN grunts]
Indeed, an excellent question.

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:48.825 position:50% align:center
You make a fair point.

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:51.786 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, I would be
happy to explain.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.581 position:50% align:center
This lowly slime monster who
knows nothing about anything

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:57.167 position:50% align:center
was lucky enough to obtain
the Demon Lord Seed!

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.294 position:50% align:center
But in his avarice,
he traveled to the human realm

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:02.088 position:50% align:center
to investigate the treasure
he had newly acquired.

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:04.674 position:50% align:center
Then, on a whim, he started
an all-out war with the humans

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:07.260 position:50% align:center
of Falmuth and used
Veldora the Storm Dragon,

00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:08.720 position:50% align:center
who had previously
been banished,

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:10.388 position:50% align:center
to stage a brutal genocide!

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.682 position:50% align:center
If we allow one as
pathetic as him to go free,

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:15.435 position:50% align:center
then our own reputation as
Demon Lords will be tarnished!

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:16.603 position:50% align:center
So purge him!

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:18.605 position:50% align:center
That's right!
I believe it's the only

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:21.983 position:50% align:center
reasonable course of action!
Who's with me?!

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.696 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Lovely speech,
but there's still no proof.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.073 position:50% align:center
Listen up, buddy.

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:30.909 position:50% align:center
All you're telling us is what
you wish would happen.

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:32.160 position:50% align:center
Without some kind of evidence,

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:34.371 position:50% align:center
you're not going to
convince anyone here.

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:36.164 position:50% align:center
That's enough!
You're just a slime

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:37.540 position:50% align:center
borrowing a dragon's power!

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:39.042 position:50% align:center
It's unthinkable
that one such as you

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:40.418 position:50% align:center
could become a Demon Lord!

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:42.879 position:50% align:center
Slime or not,
I can still destroy you.

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50% align:center
Veldora's my friend,
not a weapon.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.050 position:50% align:center
Look, it's whatever--
I didn't come here to listen

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:49.302 position:50% align:center
to your boring-ass fairytales.

00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:51.471 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] The point is,
Phobio, the majin who sent

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:53.932 position:50% align:center
that transmission,
can personally testify

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:57.102 position:50% align:center
Charybdis was revived
under your orders.

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:01.022 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] The suggestion came
from those very same clowns

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:02.732 position:50% align:center
in the image I just showed you.

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.651 position:50% align:center
And now, a man
under your command,

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:07.821 position:50% align:center
has turned into Charybdis
and gone on a rampage.

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:10.281 position:50% align:center
This is what concrete
evidence looks like.

00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:12.367 position:50% align:center
If you think I'm bluffing,
that's your call.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.662 position:50% align:center
You're welcome to think it
all the way to your grave.

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:21.876 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN grunts]

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:26.381 position:50% align:center
No...

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:27.924 position:50% align:center
Come now!

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:30.635 position:50% align:center
Are we going to allow him to
get away with such violence?!

00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:33.596 position:50% align:center
What he's doing is
an insult to Demon Lords!

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.182 position:50% align:center
He must be punished!
Surely, you all agree with--

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:38.643 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:39.853 position:50% align:center
"Violence," you say?

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:42.313 position:50% align:center
Weird. Big words coming
from someone who tried

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:45.483 position:50% align:center
to mind-control me the whole
time you were speaking earlier.

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:46.860 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN gasps]

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:48.987 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I guess you thought
I wouldn't notice, huh?

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.073 position:50% align:center
Those attacks don't work on me,
but I do wonder if mind control

00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:55.035 position:50% align:center
through a speech is even
allowed at Walpurgis.

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:56.369 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
It's not.

00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:58.955 position:50% align:center
In the interest of impartiality
for everyone here,

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.915 position:50% align:center
it is only acceptable
to appeal to others

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:02.917 position:50% align:center
using your own physical words.

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:04.669 position:50% align:center
What? Try to be reasonable!

00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:05.920 position:50% align:center
He's insulting us Demon Lords--

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:07.422 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Shut up!

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:09.507 position:50% align:center
Look man, if you've got
a problem with me,

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:12.635 position:50% align:center
then it needs to be settled
between the two of us.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.305 position:50% align:center
Like I told you before,

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.766 position:50% align:center
the status of Demon Lord
means nothing to me.

00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:19.517 position:50% align:center
I only want to build
a nation where I can

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:21.728 position:50% align:center
enjoy my life comfortably.

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:24.939 position:50% align:center
I need the cooperation of
humans to achieve that goal,

00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:27.859 position:50% align:center
which is why I have
decided to protect them.

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:30.236 position:50% align:center
Anyone who interferes
with that--whether they're

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.198 position:50% align:center
human, a Demon Lord,
or the Holy Church--

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:35.033 position:50% align:center
is my enemy.

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:38.536 position:50% align:center
That includes you, Clayman.
So get ready.

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:47.253 position:50% align:center
[GUY] He does have
a valid point, Clayman.

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:48.755 position:50% align:center
If you are Demon Lord,

00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:50.840 position:50% align:center
then you should fight
this majin yourself.

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:54.219 position:50% align:center
Defeat him using
your own strength and win.

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:57.972 position:50% align:center
Also, do you proclaim yourself
a Demon Lord, Rimuru?

00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.100 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I've already
accepted the role

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:02.143 position:50% align:center
of Leader of the
Great Forest of Jura.

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:05.021 position:50% align:center
In the humans' eyes,
I am a Demon Lord.

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.439 position:50% align:center
Very well, then.

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:08.066 position:50% align:center
Fortunately for you,
you're surrounded by

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:09.609 position:50% align:center
a room of witnesses.

00:10:09.693 --> 00:10:12.654 position:50% align:center
If you can manage to defeat
Clayman in front of all of us,

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:15.031 position:50% align:center
we will recognize you
as a true Demon Lord.

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:17.033 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] So, if I can just
beat Clayman to a pulp,

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:18.827 position:50% align:center
it'll settle everything.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.954 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN chuckles]

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:22.872 position:50% align:center
How irritating.

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.375 position:50% align:center
It would appear my unwillingness
to get my hands dirty

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:28.044 position:50% align:center
has landed me in a rather
precarious situation.

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:30.130 position:50% align:center
I suppose even I make mistakes.

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:33.758 position:50% align:center
All this scheming has led me
to be a victim of my own design.

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:36.553 position:50% align:center
All right, Milim,
that's your cue.

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:55.321 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Wow, typical.

00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:57.574 position:50% align:center
Still forcing others
to do your dirty work?

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:59.492 position:50% align:center
What's worse is that you're
roping Milim into this

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:01.327 position:50% align:center
after you hit her earlier.

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:05.123 position:50% align:center
Don't be silly. I have every
intention of fighting, as well.

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:08.043 position:50% align:center
So, Guy? Do you take issue
with this arrangement?

00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:09.377 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
None at all.

00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:11.254 position:50% align:center
If Milim wants to assist you
of her own volition,

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:13.757 position:50% align:center
then I see no
reason to stop her.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.717 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I'm in deep trouble now.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.552 position:50% align:center
Clayman's one thing...

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.888 position:50% align:center
...but Milim is bad news.

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:24.601 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] No, I'm gonna
save you, no matter what.

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:26.811 position:50% align:center
I will set you free, Milim.

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:29.105 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Okay, fine.

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:31.524 position:50% align:center
I was planning to save Milim
one way or another.

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:34.402 position:50% align:center
I'll break your mind control
by force if I have to.

00:11:34.486 --> 00:11:35.612 position:50% align:center
A foolish wish.

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:38.031 position:50% align:center
The only thing you'll do
is die miserably.

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:40.533 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Please, killing you
would be a simple task.

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:43.620 position:50% align:center
But if I were to do that, then
I'd just be bullying the weak.

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:46.247 position:50% align:center
One of my subordinates
should be perfect for you.

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:47.415 position:50% align:center

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:24.382 position:50% align:center
other Demon Lords.

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:25.967 position:50% align:center
More importantly,

00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:28.511 position:50% align:center
this score is for the slime and
Clayman to settle themselves.

00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:30.388 position:50% align:center
There's no reason
for you to get involved.

00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:31.681 position:50% align:center
What're you talking about?!

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.600 position:50% align:center
Plus, you're letting
Milim join the fight?!

00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:35.143 position:50% align:center
Yes, because she's allowed.

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
That's not fair! Why is Milim
allowed to join and not me?!

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:39.147 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
Would you pipe down?

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.774 position:50% align:center
Whatever's going on,
I'm sure that Milim has

00:15:40.857 --> 00:15:42.108 position:50% align:center
her own plan in mind.

00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:43.651 position:50% align:center
Whoa, why did you make it
sound like I don't have

00:15:43.735 --> 00:15:44.861 position:50% align:center
a plan in mind?

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:46.404 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
Am I wrong?

00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:47.405 position:50% align:center
Besides...

00:15:47.489 --> 00:15:48.823 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:48.907 --> 00:15:50.825 position:50% align:center
[GUY] Just who has your
oh-so-faithful attendant sworn

00:15:50.909 --> 00:15:52.452 position:50% align:center
their loyalty to?

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:54.954 position:50% align:center
Your other attendant that's
present seems to be devoting

00:15:55.038 --> 00:15:57.123 position:50% align:center
her all to protecting you...

00:15:57.207 --> 00:15:59.167 position:50% align:center
...but not this one.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.962 position:50% align:center
Yes, it may have sworn loyalty
to you, but not completely.

00:16:03.046 --> 00:16:06.633 position:50% align:center
Do you really want to trust
an attendant that fickle?

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.093 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA]
It's true.

00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:11.054 position:50% align:center
I am weighing one master's
worth against the other.

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:14.182 position:50% align:center
Between my master
and creator, Lord Rimuru,

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:16.851 position:50% align:center
and Lady Ramiris.

00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:20.855 position:50% align:center
However, Lord Rimuru requested
that I protect Lady Ramiris

00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:22.399 position:50% align:center
and keep her safe.

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.818 position:50% align:center
In the time I have known her,
I have deemed it acceptable

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:26.695 position:50% align:center
to serve Lady Ramiris.

00:16:26.778 --> 00:16:31.032 position:50% align:center
Therefore, I do not find there
to be any contradiction.

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:34.202 position:50% align:center
You see, I wish to repay
a debt to Lord Rimuru.

00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:36.663 position:50% align:center
And while that is my wish,
if it is my lady's wish

00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:41.042 position:50% align:center
to also save Lord Rimuru, then
I am all too happy to oblige.

00:16:41.126 --> 00:16:45.046 position:50% align:center
What's this? Audacious enough
to address me directly, are you?

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:48.341 position:50% align:center
Ramiris? Tell me--
does this golem speak the truth?

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:49.759 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course!

00:16:49.843 --> 00:16:51.011 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see.

00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:53.263 position:50% align:center
So, it will take action
because you wish it to.

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:54.806 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:57.976 position:50% align:center
You have acquired quite the
excellent attendant, Ramiris.

00:16:58.059 --> 00:16:59.352 position:50% align:center
Nuh-uh!

00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:02.981 position:50% align:center
I didn't acquire it--
we just became good friends!

00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
Beretta...

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:06.901 position:50% align:center
[giggles]
...and Treyni, too!

00:17:06.985 --> 00:17:09.279 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU grunting]

00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:11.990 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS]
Oh yeah, that includes Rimuru!

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:13.575 position:50% align:center
They're important to me!

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:15.577 position:50% align:center
We're friends till the end!

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.663 position:50% align:center
[GUY] Hmm. Very well then,
if that's how you feel.

00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:19.748 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA]
I thank you.

00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:21.583 position:50% align:center
Rouge, the Primordial Red.

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:23.460 position:50% align:center
Of course,
but don't call me that.

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:26.046 position:50% align:center
I grant you permission
to call me "Guy," okay?

00:17:26.129 --> 00:17:28.131 position:50% align:center
Also, you're henceforth
forbidden to accept

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:31.051 position:50% align:center
any master other
than Ramiris. Got it?

00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:33.636 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA] Guy, I swear
my loyalty to none other

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.306 position:50% align:center
but Lady Ramiris herself
from this point onward.

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:37.891 position:50% align:center
You're sure about this?

00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:40.727 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA] Yes. After all,
Lord Rimuru already has

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:43.313 position:50% align:center
a capable servant who is
far stronger than me.

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:44.689 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
Hmm...

00:17:44.773 --> 00:17:47.359 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA] In addition,
I enjoy conducting research.

00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:49.527 position:50% align:center
My days of researching with
Lady Ramiris have been like

00:17:49.611 --> 00:17:51.363 position:50% align:center
a dream come true.

00:17:51.446 --> 00:17:53.907 position:50% align:center
Oh! Please forgive me.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:57.744 position:50% align:center
Tell me, Beretta.
What is your family lineage?

00:17:57.827 --> 00:18:00.872 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA] Hmph. Once upon
a time, I was the least

00:18:00.955 --> 00:18:02.374 position:50% align:center
of the greater demons.

00:18:02.457 --> 00:18:04.959 position:50% align:center
But to be perfectly honest,
I believe there are very few

00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:06.711 position:50% align:center
who share my bloodline.

00:18:06.795 --> 00:18:09.381 position:50% align:center
So you come from
a small lineage. Huh.

00:18:09.464 --> 00:18:10.715 position:50% align:center
That makes sense.

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:13.134 position:50% align:center
It would also explain why
you show no fear of me.

00:18:13.218 --> 00:18:15.845 position:50% align:center
After all, that bloodline is
self-serving and interested only

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:19.015 position:50% align:center
in amusement. And earlier, you
mentioned that there is someone

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:21.893 position:50% align:center
you recognize as
stronger than yourself?

00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:23.770 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA]
Yes, I am still far behind.

00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:26.356 position:50% align:center
As long as that one
is serving Lord Rimuru,

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:28.650 position:50% align:center
I will have no other
opportunities to be of use.

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:30.235 position:50% align:center
This is my only chance.

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:32.570 position:50% align:center
Right. You might be correct.

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:35.198 position:50% align:center
I understand your feelings
on the matter.

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:37.075 position:50% align:center
You may participate.

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:39.536 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS gasps]

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:41.204 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA]
Please, excuse me.

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:43.415 position:50% align:center
Be strong! You've got this!

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:47.961 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
I see. Interesting.

00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:52.424 position:50% align:center
So you're on the move, Noir.
The infamous Primordial Black.

00:18:52.507 --> 00:18:55.135 position:50% align:center
But if Noir is serving him...

00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:58.596 position:50% align:center
[GUY] ...I imagine
that slime must be quite

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.099 position:50% align:center
the fascinating character.

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:03.268 position:50% align:center
His name was Rimuru, yes?

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:05.145 position:50% align:center
I'll remember that...

00:19:05.228 --> 00:19:06.312 position:50% align:center

This is seriously bad!

I'd be six feet under by now!

Viola, my finest masterpiece?

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:25.874 position:50% align:center
[CLAYMAN chuckles]

00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:28.209 position:50% align:center

Sure, that thing is strong,

00:19:36.468 --> 00:19:38.511 position:50% align:center
but I wouldn't
call it beautiful.

Shion's mad.

00:19:52.901 --> 00:19:55.362 position:50% align:center
And she's scary
when she blows up.

00:19:55.445 --> 00:19:57.947 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA] I apologize
for keeping you waiting.

00:19:58.031 --> 00:20:01.284 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru, please make use
of my strength, as well.

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:04.412 position:50% align:center
Nice timing, Beretta!
Think you can go help Shion out?

00:20:04.496 --> 00:20:05.872 position:50% align:center
--[BERETTA] Of course!
--Beretta!

00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:08.792 position:50% align:center
Don't hold back, 'kay?!
Destroy them all!

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:11.086 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Good. That should
even things out.

00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:12.379 position:50% align:center
Now...

00:20:12.462 --> 00:20:15.799 position:50% align:center
If I can just free Milim,
I'll win this fight!

00:20:19.344 --> 00:20:21.179 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Raphael! Please
run a full-power Appraisal

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:24.349 position:50% align:center
on the spell that Clayman's
using to control Milim!

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.314 position:50% align:center

Answer: Result of Appraisal.

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:32.649 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
What is it?!

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
There is no spell found.

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:37.195 position:50% align:center
Huh?! What the heck
does that mean?!

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:39.322 position:50% align:center
Hold up, are you trying to
say you're not strong enough

00:20:39.406 --> 00:20:41.366 position:50% align:center
to detect Clayman's magic?

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:43.910 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] I could not verify
the spell used. This indicates--

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:46.121 position:50% align:center
How useless. Here, I thought
you were supposed

00:20:46.204 --> 00:20:47.288 position:50% align:center
to be super strong.

00:20:47.372 --> 00:20:48.331 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Hmph!

00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:49.958 position:50% align:center
Hey, why are you acting angry?!

00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:51.668 position:50% align:center

should be pissed off!

I am beyond screwed here.

00:20:58.049 --> 00:20:59.968 position:50% align:center
I don't suppose she'd
return to normal if I just

00:21:00.051 --> 00:21:01.720 position:50% align:center
slugged her, right?

00:21:01.803 --> 00:21:03.638 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Suggestion: I propose using

00:21:03.722 --> 00:21:06.266 position:50% align:center
an energy-absorbing attack
like Beelzebub.

00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:07.892 position:50% align:center
Great idea!

00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:11.980 position:50% align:center

All right, this is good!

00:21:23.366 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50% align:center
Sweetness, I'll just damage her
bit by bit and wait for

00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:28.121 position:50% align:center
the dumb spell to wear off.
