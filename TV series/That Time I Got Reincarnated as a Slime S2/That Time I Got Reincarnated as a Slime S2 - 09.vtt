00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:23.898 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Sorry for the wait, everyone.

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:26.860 position:50% align:center
We're going to
begin our meeting now.

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:30.238 position:50% align:center
The topics are how we'll deal
with humans from here on out.

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:32.866 position:50% align:center
And the resurrection
of Shion and the others.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.380 position:50% align:center
[EREN] It's the tale of
a girl and her pet dragon.

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:13.091 position:50% align:center
The girl was the daughter of
a human and a dragon,

00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:16.511 position:50% align:center
and she was raised as
the Dragon Princess.

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:18.680 position:50% align:center
One day, her father, a dragon,

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:21.599 position:50% align:center
made a double of himself
in the form of a baby

00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:23.560 position:50% align:center
so the girl would have a friend.

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:26.229 position:50% align:center
[EREN]
But then,

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:29.232 position:50% align:center
in an effort to gain control
over the Dragon Princess.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:33.028 position:50% align:center
A king killed her beloved pet.

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:37.407 position:50% align:center
The girl went mad with
pain, grief, and rage.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.536 position:50% align:center
[EREN] With the power she
had inherited from her father,

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:45.415 position:50% align:center
she destroyed the king
along with his entire nation,

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:48.293 position:50% align:center
including tens of
thousands of people.

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:51.296 position:50% align:center
Then the girl transformed
into a Demon Lord.

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.341 position:50% align:center
And when she did,
the baby dragon miraculously

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:56.176 position:50% align:center
came back to life.

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:02.265 position:50% align:center
[EREN] But, since the creature
had lost its soul when it died,

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.727 position:50% align:center
it came back as an evil monster
with no will of its own

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.730 position:50% align:center
and destroyed
everything in its path.

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:11.733 position:50% align:center
It was known as
the Chaos Dragon.

00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:15.195 position:50% align:center
Though it pained her greatly,
the girl sealed away

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:17.781 position:50% align:center
her once-beloved companion.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:20.658 position:50% align:center
This was the very first task
she accomplished upon

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:23.203 position:50% align:center
becoming a Demon Lord.

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:26.122 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
There you have it.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.750 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm going
to become a Demon Lord.

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:31.044 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:33.838 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:36.675 position:50% align:center
[LIZARDMAN 10F] What?! Lord
Rimuru's gonna be a Demon Lord?!

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:39.052 position:50% align:center
--[LIZARDMAN 10G] Shh!
--[LIZARDMAN 10F] Sorry!

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:40.220 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
There's an army heading here

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:42.555 position:50% align:center
from the Kingdom of Falmuth.

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:49.521 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I'm going to use
10,000 soldiers as nourishment

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:51.898 position:50% align:center
to evolve into a Demon Lord.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:57.112 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] The chance of Shion and
the others being resurrected

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:59.030 position:50% align:center
is a whole 3%.

00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:01.700 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.706 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you serious,
Lord Rimuru?

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.040 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Hold on, please.

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:11.459 position:50% align:center
I'm sure each of you have
questions and concerns,

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:14.337 position:50% align:center
but I'd like for you to hear
everything I have to say first.

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:15.755 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:18.049 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU grunts]

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:21.261 position:50% align:center
The truth is,
I was once a human myself.

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:23.638 position:50% align:center
And I lived in the same world
that your "Otherworlders"

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:25.724 position:50% align:center
usually come from.

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:30.603 position:50% align:center
But one day, I died.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.245 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I was reborn in this world...

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:49.080 position:50% align:center
...as a slime.

00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:59.966 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] At first,
I was completely on my own.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:15.398 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] But even in this
new form, I found friends.

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:29.287 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
As well as allies.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.444 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
That's you guys.

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:02.696 position:50% align:center
[GROUP chuckles]

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.406 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
You're my family.

00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:08.243 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
And you're important to me.

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:12.205 position:50% align:center
[LIZARDMAN 10F wailing]

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:14.207 position:50% align:center
--Lord Rimuru...
--[sobbing]

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.126 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I said I liked
humans and made the rule

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:19.004 position:50% align:center
that we wouldn't attack them
because I used to be one.

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:21.756 position:50% align:center
I couldn't let it go.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.426 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I'm a monster,
but I considered myself

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:27.804 position:50% align:center
human at heart. It's why I
pushed us to hang out with them

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:30.598 position:50% align:center
and why I wanted
to be their friends.

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:33.643 position:50% align:center
Regretting my decisions
won't erase what's happened,

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.186 position:50% align:center
but I need you to know
I never wanted

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.105 position:50% align:center
you guys to get hurt.

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:43.111 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I should have
come back here sooner

00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:45.739 position:50% align:center
instead of staying
so long in Ingrassia.

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:48.116 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA]
No. It isn't your fault.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:51.619 position:50% align:center
We're to blame for relying too
heavily on you as our protector.

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:54.205 position:50% align:center
We should have
been more vigilant.

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:56.833 position:50% align:center
This is a result of
our own carelessness.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.252 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
My sister beat me to it.

00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:02.297 position:50% align:center
I'm a poor excuse
for an older brother.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.300 position:50% align:center
These events have
made me aware of that.

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:07.469 position:50% align:center
When the barrier cut off
our connection to you,

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:11.014 position:50% align:center
the constant feeling that we
were all-powerful also vanished.

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:12.932 position:50% align:center
Deep down, I felt
panicked at losing

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:15.602 position:50% align:center
the one I had relied upon.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.937 position:50% align:center
You trusted me to
look after Tempest,

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:21.524 position:50% align:center
so the only one to blame
for this tragedy is myself.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:23.151 position:50% align:center
[RIGUR]
Hold on, Benimaru!

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.778 position:50% align:center
I'm the head of the guard
and I still managed

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:28.198 position:50% align:center
to let everybody down.
So I'm to blame, too!

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:29.699 position:50% align:center
--[GELD] No.
--[RIMURU] Huh?

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:31.326 position:50% align:center
I was overseeing the new road.

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:34.079 position:50% align:center
I should have been more alert to
the travelers who were using it.

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:35.246 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Huh?!

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.040 position:50% align:center
--[GOBTA] It's my fault!
--[RIMURU groans]

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:39.834 position:50% align:center
I think I might have egged the
bad guys on a little too much.

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:41.169 position:50% align:center
Girls really don't like it when

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:42.379 position:50% align:center
--you call them plain, huh?
--That wasn't it...

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.381 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Cut it out!
It's not a competition!

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.841 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who was
too careless, okay?!

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:49.010 position:50% align:center
I put my own feelings first
and you were the ones

00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:50.512 position:50% align:center
who paid the price!

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:52.764 position:50% align:center
The fault is mine alone.

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:55.725 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry, everyone.

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:57.602 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru...

00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:59.771 position:50% align:center
[RANGA whines]

00:07:59.854 --> 00:08:01.272 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU]
If I may.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.317 position:50% align:center
The fact that you prioritized
your own feelings

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:06.653 position:50% align:center
isn't something you
should apologize for.

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:09.155 position:50% align:center
And honestly,
it's not about just you.

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:12.242 position:50% align:center
This only happened because
we all let our guards down.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:15.120 position:50% align:center
We were too weak
to protect ourselves.

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:17.288 position:50% align:center
It was our own negligence
that allowed those scoundrels

00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:20.542 position:50% align:center
to storm into our city and
do whatever they wanted.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.585 position:50% align:center
Does everyone here
agree with me?

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:25.130 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:29.134 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
You guys...

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:30.468 position:50% align:center
My lord.

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:33.304 position:50% align:center
No matter what, you're
still our fearless leader.

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:36.808 position:50% align:center
Whether you want to befriend
humans, or become a Demon Lord,

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:40.228 position:50% align:center
we'll gladly follow whatever
path you set out for us.

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:42.272 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Doesn't it bother you
guys to have an ex-human

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.274 position:50% align:center
ordering you around, though?

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:47.861 position:50% align:center
Muh? Does that change
who you are now?

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:49.696 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
No, of course not.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:51.448 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA giggles]

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:54.701 position:50% align:center
We love you because of who you
are and what you've done for us.

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:57.829 position:50% align:center
What you were in your previous
life makes no difference.

00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:58.913 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:00.707 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.169 position:50% align:center
I'd say we all feel that way.

00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:08.298 position:50% align:center
Nobody here is concerned about
the details of your former life.

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:09.716 position:50% align:center
We will follow you.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.509 position:50% align:center
End of story.

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:13.011 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Really?

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:17.807 position:50% align:center
[cheering]

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:23.855 position:50% align:center
[KAIJIN] So, here's
the next big question.

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:25.523 position:50% align:center
[slurps]

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:27.233 position:50% align:center
Mm...

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:29.277 position:50% align:center
What exactly are your
plans for any humans

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:31.738 position:50% align:center
you may meet in the future?

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:34.240 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Well, the way I see it,

00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:37.494 position:50% align:center
humans can be
either good or evil.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.455 position:50% align:center
It's kind of how
humanity operates.

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:44.084 position:50% align:center
They're greatly influenced by
the environment they're in.

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:46.670 position:50% align:center
Even if someone is good,
if the country they live in

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:51.591 position:50% align:center
turns down an evil path, they'll
eventually feel its influence.

00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:53.885 position:50% align:center
Which is why I would like
to create an environment

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:56.554 position:50% align:center
where humans can learn
more about our country.

00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:58.473 position:50% align:center
If they could just
understand us better,

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:00.934 position:50% align:center
then they might turn out
to be good neighbors.

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:03.311 position:50% align:center
That way, we could eventually
erase the boundary

00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:05.689 position:50% align:center
between humans and monsters.

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:09.317 position:50% align:center
I really want to believe
that's a possibility.

00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:12.487 position:50% align:center
Sure, it's kind of naïve,
but it's my sincere hope

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.863 position:50% align:center
for the future.

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:16.574 position:50% align:center
Though that sort of thinking
is premature right now.

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:18.535 position:50% align:center
The first thing we need to do
is get the humans

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.829 position:50% align:center
to acknowledge our existence.

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:24.374 position:50% align:center
I get it. With you ruling as a
full-fledged Demon Lord,

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:26.084 position:50% align:center
they'll know they're at a
disadvantage and won't be

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
able to negotiate
through sheer force.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:29.713 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Yep.

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:32.132 position:50% align:center
I could also work to keep
the other Demon Lords in check.

00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:34.300 position:50% align:center
Which in turn would act as
a sort of shield to protect

00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:37.387 position:50% align:center
the human nations
from their meddling.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.015 position:50% align:center
Any person with an actual brain
would choose coexistence

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:42.017 position:50% align:center
over antagonism.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.561 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Exactly. We'll work
with the humans who are friendly

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.646 position:50% align:center
with us and deal with the
malicious ones in a way

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:51.401 position:50% align:center
that mirrors their own actions.
That's my idea for right now.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.574 position:50% align:center
That's a pretty soft
and idealistic view, Rimuru.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:11:00.785 position:50% align:center
Certainly not the kind of thing
a future Demon Lord would say.

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:02.662 position:50% align:center
Still though...

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:04.873 position:50% align:center
I can't say I dislike it.

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:06.833 position:50% align:center
I think it suits you.

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:08.043 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]

00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:10.712 position:50% align:center
Plus, who cares
if it's idealistic?

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:12.630 position:50% align:center
If anyone were capable
of building that sort of

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:16.593 position:50% align:center
dream world, then it would
definitely be Lord Rimuru.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:19.054 position:50% align:center
There's no reason for us
to keep debating it.

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:22.349 position:50% align:center
Not after we've already
decided to follow his lead.

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:23.808 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] Once you've
successfully become

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:26.061 position:50% align:center
a Demon Lord, I hope that
you'll prepare a fitting job

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:27.854 position:50% align:center
for all of us.

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:29.272 position:50% align:center
We shall be your
faithful shadows

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:30.940 position:50% align:center
no matter what you choose.

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:32.692 position:50% align:center
We'll obey any orders
you give us.

00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:33.735 position:50% align:center
As you command.

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:35.987 position:50% align:center
And naturally,
the same goes for me!

00:11:36.071 --> 00:11:37.447 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Thank you.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.740 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Me, too, Master!

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:41.368 position:50% align:center
I shall faithfully
serve as your fangs.

00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:44.120 position:50% align:center
I'll tear apart anyone who
dares to stand in your way!

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:46.289 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Ranga...!

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:47.540 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me...

00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:50.251 position:50% align:center
I bet you want us
to create a new nation,

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:52.962 position:50% align:center
and then turn everyone there
to your side, am I right?

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:55.715 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] It's like you
can read my mind, Youm!

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:58.593 position:50% align:center
Ah? No way,
you're just predictable.

00:11:58.677 --> 00:12:00.762 position:50% align:center
[laughter]

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:02.180 position:50% align:center
[YOUM chuckles]

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:06.101 position:50% align:center
Rimuru. No matter what,
let's keep being friends, okay?

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:09.646 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Yeah. Sure!
That won't change.

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.022 position:50% align:center
Thank you, everyone!

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:13.942 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll keep
supporting my selfish desires.

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:16.778 position:50% align:center
[laughter, overlapping dialog]

00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:19.322 position:50% align:center
[cheering]

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.784 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Their cheers filled me with joy,

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:26.413 position:50% align:center
and I realized this place
truly was my home.

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:29.374 position:50% align:center
The boundary between
humans and monsters

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:33.503 position:50% align:center
could be overcome with some
planning and communication.

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:36.589 position:50% align:center
More than ever,
I believed that.

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.345 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
All right-y, then.

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:44.597 position:50% align:center
Do we have any deets
on the enemy's army?

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:48.476 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] Yes. Here's what
Souei told us about them.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.938 position:50% align:center
If the force he saw
keeps up its current pace,

00:12:52.022 --> 00:12:55.984 position:50% align:center
then it should reach Tempest in
about three days, give or take.

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:02.157 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] There are
10,000 knights from Falmuth.

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:05.118 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Six thousand mercenaries.

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:08.538 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
And a thousand magic users.

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.292 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] It also includes
3,000 Temple Knights

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:16.338 position:50% align:center
of the Western Holy Church,
Making them quite formidable.

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:19.549 position:50% align:center
Twenty thousand, huh? I see.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.218 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] They might have big
numbers, but they lack strength.

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:23.470 position:50% align:center
It's no biggie.

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:24.554 position:50% align:center
--[ALL gasp]
--Yeah!

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:27.182 position:50% align:center
That's Lord Rimuru for you.

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:29.059 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Twenty thousand...

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:30.643 position:50% align:center
That's double the
nourishment that I need

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:33.480 position:50% align:center
to become a Demon Lord.

00:13:33.563 --> 00:13:36.316 position:50% align:center
I already have the seed, but
I'll have to take in human souls

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:39.402 position:50% align:center
if I want to become the real
deal and resurrect everyone.

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:40.820 position:50% align:center
[GELD]
How should we allot our forces?

00:13:40.904 --> 00:13:42.364 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:45.033 position:50% align:center
Personally, I think my force
should face them upon arrival.

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:48.078 position:50% align:center
Let the Goblin Riders be
a part of the vanguard, too!

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:51.164 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] No. Sorry, but I need
to handle the allied force.

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:52.499 position:50% align:center
[GOBTA]
Ah--

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:53.917 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I have a reason.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.836 position:50% align:center
It has to do with the revival
of our fallen citizens,

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.672 position:50% align:center
it's essential that
I become a Demon Lord

00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:01.091 position:50% align:center
in order to make it work.

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:04.010 position:50% align:center
And taking out the invading
army myself is a necessary part

00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:06.304 position:50% align:center
of that process-- it's
the only way for me

00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:08.014 position:50% align:center
to complete my evolution.

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:10.183 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:13.061 position:50% align:center
[RIGURD groans] Regardless,
I worry that it might be

00:14:13.144 --> 00:14:15.772 position:50% align:center
too dangerous to face
them by yourself.

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:16.981 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Don't worry.

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:19.651 position:50% align:center
I won't be careless,
and I won't hold back.

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:21.611 position:50% align:center
Right, please be safe, sir.

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:25.156 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]
That's not the only reason.

00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:29.869 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
The truth is...

00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:33.748 position:50% align:center
...I still feel like this whole
situation was my fault.

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:36.167 position:50% align:center
I have to do this to make
sure I never allow myself

00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:38.837 position:50% align:center
to become this
complacent again.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.506 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:45.301 position:50% align:center
I understand. We'll entrust
the allied forces to you.

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:48.054 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Mm. On that note,

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:50.807 position:50% align:center
there is something else
I want you guys to take care of.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.309 position:50% align:center
--Sir!
--Just name it!

00:14:55.854 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] There are devices
placed around the city

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.233 position:50% align:center
in all four directions
to maintain the barrier.

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:04.070 position:50% align:center
Each one is guarded by
a different company of knights.

00:15:04.154 --> 00:15:05.822 position:50% align:center
I need you to take them all out.

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:07.532 position:50% align:center
Preferably at the same time.

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:09.117 position:50% align:center
Makes sense.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.120 position:50% align:center
Right then. So, we'll need to
choose which teams will attack.

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:13.538 position:50% align:center
Please allow me to do it, sir!

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:14.789 position:50% align:center
I'll go, too!

00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:17.250 position:50% align:center
Besides, I've got
a serious score to settle.

00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:19.669 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Take it easy.
I've already chosen the teams.

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:20.795 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:25.508 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
We'll send Benimaru to the east.

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:29.387 position:50% align:center
Hakurou, Rigur, Gobta, and Geld
will take the one in the west.

00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:32.682 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Gabiru and
his men will go south.

00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:37.771 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] And Souei
will lead his party north.

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:40.648 position:50% align:center
Thank you for allowing us to
take part. It'll be our honor.

00:15:40.732 --> 00:15:42.233 position:50% align:center
We won't let you down!

00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:44.903 position:50% align:center
[LIZARDMEN]
Yeah!

00:15:44.986 --> 00:15:46.112 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Think you can win?

00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:47.655 position:50% align:center
[SOUEI]
With relative ease.

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:48.656 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Good.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.408 position:50% align:center
Benimaru?

00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:53.119 position:50% align:center
I don't doubt your strength or
anything, but you'll be facing

00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:56.623 position:50% align:center
nearly a hundred knights alone.
If you run into trouble...

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.458 position:50% align:center
There's no need to worry, sir.

00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:01.586 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I'm just saying,
don't hold back this time.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.090 position:50% align:center
Very well. There's even
less cause for concern.

00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:07.342 position:50% align:center
While I would like it to be
known that I have no intention

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:09.386 position:50% align:center
of failing you
again, Lord Rimuru,

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:11.179 position:50% align:center
I can't help but notice
that you're deploying us

00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:13.390 position:50% align:center
to the west intentionally.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:20.438 position:50% align:center
There is a good chance that's
where those three miscreants

00:16:20.522 --> 00:16:23.191 position:50% align:center
will be stationed. Correct?

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Yeah...

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:27.946 position:50% align:center
They're probably blocking
the path of escape to Blumund.

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:29.989 position:50% align:center
They'd set some
troops aside for that.

00:16:30.073 --> 00:16:32.033 position:50% align:center
And I'd expect it's likely
their fighters will be

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:34.327 position:50% align:center
Otherworlders, like me.

00:16:34.411 --> 00:16:37.747 position:50% align:center
[HAKUROU chuckles] That's not
a problem in the slightest.

00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:40.667 position:50% align:center
I lost before because I let
my guard down, but I am now

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.669 position:50% align:center
keenly aware of
how they operate,

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:46.297 position:50% align:center
so they won't be getting
the drop on me again.

00:16:46.381 --> 00:16:48.425 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Good. I'm counting on you.

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:49.801 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru!

00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:52.220 position:50% align:center
We aren't the weaklings
that we used to be, either!

00:16:52.303 --> 00:16:53.722 position:50% align:center
We have the strength to fight,

00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center
and we no longer need Sir
Hakurou's constant protection.

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:59.728 position:50% align:center
That's right! I'm gonna avenge
Gobzo no matter what!

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:01.521 position:50% align:center
I will use the power
that you granted me

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:03.356 position:50% align:center
as an orc king to the fullest!

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.859 position:50% align:center
Our numbers are small,
but we are strong.

00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:07.485 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Lovin' the confidence!

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:10.280 position:50% align:center
Okay, the teams I just named
will destroy those devices

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:12.407 position:50% align:center
so the barrier can't
weaken us anymore.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.117 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Right!

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.118 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Shuna.

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:16.661 position:50% align:center
Sir?

00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:18.705 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] There's a pretty decent
chance this barrier is also

00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:21.207 position:50% align:center
what's keeping Shion
and the others' souls here.

00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:22.917 position:50% align:center
You get me?

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:25.211 position:50% align:center
Yes. We are going
to need another barrier

00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:27.005 position:50% align:center
to take its place.

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:28.423 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Exactly right.

00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:30.967 position:50% align:center
No problem.
The chances may be slim,

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:34.387 position:50% align:center
but I'll give my all to help
revive those we lost.

00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:35.889 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I know you will.

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:37.766 position:50% align:center
Mjurran.

00:17:37.849 --> 00:17:40.143 position:50% align:center
I'd like to make use
of your powers, too.

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:41.644 position:50% align:center
Think you can help out Shuna?

00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:43.438 position:50% align:center
I'd be happy to.

00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:45.648 position:50% align:center
I can't deny
my part in all this.

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:48.193 position:50% align:center
Helping out is
the least I can do to atone.

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:50.695 position:50% align:center
I'm looking forward to
working with you, Mjurran.

00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:52.739 position:50% align:center
Thank you, I'll do my best.

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:55.116 position:50% align:center
Great! Looks like
we're on guard duty.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.701 position:50% align:center
Sure does.

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:59.162 position:50% align:center
Don't forget about us--we can
also protect the two of them!

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:00.163 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:01.623 position:50% align:center
We'll take care of them.

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:03.458 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Mm. Rigurd.

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.877 position:50% align:center
I'm leaving you in charge here.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.379 position:50% align:center
Sir!

00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:09.047 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] The allied force
is probably expecting

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.758 position:50% align:center
a final battle in three days,
but we're commencing

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:14.344 position:50% align:center
the operation to
annihilate them immediately.

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:16.471 position:50% align:center
There's absolutely
no time to waste.

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:19.224 position:50% align:center
We will revive Shion
and the others!

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:20.934 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Right!

00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:45.792 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Allies.

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:48.086 position:50% align:center
Friends.

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:50.714 position:50% align:center
Family.

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:53.758 position:50% align:center
They're such nice
things to have.

00:18:53.842 --> 00:18:54.759 position:50% align:center
Well.

00:18:54.843 --> 00:18:56.803 position:50% align:center
Guess I should get ready, too.

00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:01.641 position:50% align:center
Hold on a minute...

00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:06.730 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Is it possible that
the 10,000 human souls

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:09.107 position:50% align:center
are what Clayman
is actually after?

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.359 position:50% align:center
Hmm...

00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:13.528 position:50% align:center
Is his plan to
use us to start a war,

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:16.406 position:50% align:center
then harvest those souls
for himself instead?

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:19.325 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
If that really were the case,

00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:22.829 position:50% align:center
he could become
a True Demon Lord.

00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:25.040 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:19:25.123 --> 00:19:26.332 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I guess for the time being,

00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:28.168 position:50% align:center
Clayman's just a small fry
that I don't need

00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:30.587 position:50% align:center
to bother messing with.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:34.049 position:50% align:center
But... I already
regard him as an enemy.

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:38.011 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Once this is all over,

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:39.596 position:50% align:center
then I'll...

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.021 position:50% align:center
[LIZARDMAN 10F]
Sir Gabiru!

00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:50.648 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:52.233 position:50% align:center
No way, you made it!

00:19:52.317 --> 00:19:55.487 position:50% align:center
Yes, Lord Rimuru just freed us
so we could leave the barrier!

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:57.989 position:50% align:center
How incredible!
I'm so glad you're okay!

00:19:58.073 --> 00:19:59.657 position:50% align:center
You, too, Sir Gabiru!

00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:01.326 position:50% align:center
We're happy you're safe!

00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:04.454 position:50% align:center
Ah! I missed you guys!

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:07.540 position:50% align:center
[sobbing, whining]

00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:10.251 position:50% align:center
[GABIRU] We may have been
born at totally different times,

00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:11.711 position:50% align:center
but we will all die together!

00:20:11.795 --> 00:20:14.714 position:50% align:center
[sobbing continues]

00:20:14.798 --> 00:20:17.175 position:50% align:center
[GABIRU]
You guys are the best!

00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:18.551 position:50% align:center
Are you done?

00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:21.012 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yes.

00:20:21.096 --> 00:20:22.514 position:50% align:center
[SOUEI]
Then let's go.

00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:25.350 position:50% align:center
[GABIRU]
Ah!

00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:27.852 position:50% align:center
Very well, men!

00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:29.270 position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:20:29.354 --> 00:20:30.772 position:50% align:center
[DRAGONEWTS]
Yeah!

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:33.692 position:50% align:center
Let us show the enemy how
strong we Dragonewts are!

00:20:33.775 --> 00:20:36.820 position:50% align:center
[DRAGONEWTS]
Yeah!

00:20:36.903 --> 00:20:39.572 position:50% align:center
[GABIRU]
All right. Let's move out!

00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:40.573 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:20:40.657 --> 00:20:42.033 position:50% align:center
Tah!

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:45.704 position:50% align:center
Whoa, Sir Gabiru's the coolest!

00:20:45.787 --> 00:20:46.913 position:50% align:center
It's true, of course.

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:49.332 position:50% align:center
All right, let's try
and follow his example!

00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:51.042 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:09.913 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] These are the guys
who killed Shion and the rest.

00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:14.084 position:50% align:center
At least there's no need
to grant them forgiveness.

00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:17.837 position:50% align:center
You're all nothing more
than my fodder.

00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:21.049 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:22:21.132 --> 00:22:22.634 position:50% align:center
Let's do this.

00:23:54.017 --> 00:23:56.019 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE]
Next time, "Megiddo."
