00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.603 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Diplomatic relations
were established

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.648 position:50% align:center
between Tempest and the
Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion.

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:27.235 position:50% align:center
Altogether, Tempest now had
three human nations as allies,

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:30.155 position:50% align:center
including Blumund and Dwargon.

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:31.531 position:50% align:center
With that,

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:34.117 position:50% align:center
our meeting between
the humans and monsters ended.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.327 position:50% align:center
Or so I thought, anyway.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.331 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right.

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:43.293 position:50% align:center
Ramiris still hasn't told me
why she came here.

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:47.505 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Hang on a sec...

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:50.383 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Isn't that
the new golem I made for her

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.552 position:50% align:center
to replace the one I destroyed?

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:56.097 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA] Allow me
to congratulate you

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:58.058 position:50% align:center
on your recent evolution
to Demon Lord.

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:00.685 position:50% align:center
Thanks. I'm glad to see
you're doing well.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.021 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA]
Ha, ha. Thank you for saying so.

00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:06.024 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Mm. Be sure to do
whatever Ramiris asks of you,

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:08.151 position:50% align:center
unless it's impossible,
of course.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:09.277 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA]
You can count on me.

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:12.072 position:50% align:center
I will live up to
your expectations.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:15.200 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I wanted to ask,
why'd you guys come here today?

00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:17.327 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA]
Uh.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.661 position:50% align:center
Lady Ramiris.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:21.122 position:50% align:center
We have no time to waste
on such frivolous things.

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:23.792 position:50% align:center
You must inform Lord Rimuru
of the situation immediately.

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:25.168 position:50% align:center
Shut up, Beretta.

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.379 position:50% align:center
Can't you see that
I'm busy at the moment?

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.673 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA] Please remember
our purpose for coming here.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.049 position:50% align:center
Who cares?

00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:33.385 position:50% align:center
Look, I've just had a meeting
with my destiny, okay?

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:36.054 position:50% align:center
I simply have to know who
the heroine is going to choose!

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:37.847 position:50% align:center
This odd-looking bundle
of parchments called manga

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:38.848 position:50% align:center
is amazing!

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:40.433 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ramiris!

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:42.102 position:50% align:center
If you don't want me to spoil
who she finally ends up with,

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:44.020 position:50% align:center
then you'd better tell me
why you're here now!

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:45.355 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS]
Right!

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:48.858 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS]
Ahem!

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:52.779 position:50% align:center
[inhales]
In that case, I'll say it again.

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:56.074 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Huh...?

00:01:56.157 --> 00:02:00.161 position:50% align:center
Your country, Tempest,
is doomed to fall!

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.879 position:50% align:center
That's it! Are you surprised?

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:34.839 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Not really--
you've said it twice.

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:37.217 position:50% align:center
Anyway, fortunately for you
and your country's people,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.302 position:50% align:center
I don't want Tempest to perish!

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.680 position:50% align:center
That's why I came all the way
out here to warn you!

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:43.056 position:50% align:center
You're welcome, by the way.

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.599 position:50% align:center
Why is Tempest doomed, though?

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:46.559 position:50% align:center
It's important not to panic!

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:49.354 position:50% align:center
Right. Just calm down
and I'll tell you the story.

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:51.690 position:50% align:center
I didn't think I was panicking.

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:53.900 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS] On Demon Lord
Clayman's proposal--

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:55.402 position:50% align:center
Aw, man, that dude?

00:03:55.485 --> 00:04:00.115 position:50% align:center
--it seems Walpurgis
has been set in motion!

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:02.492 position:50% align:center
Cool. But I don't
know what that is.

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:04.994 position:50% align:center
It's the Demon Lords'
banquet, duh!

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:08.832 position:50% align:center
An incredibly special event
that all Demon Lords attend!

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:10.583 position:50% align:center
It's called Walpurgis.

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:14.045 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes, according to something
I've read in ancient literature,

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.881 position:50% align:center
when they assemble,
a great war will ensue. Right?

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:18.133 position:50% align:center
A war?

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:20.051 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's what
I've heard, anyway.

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:22.387 position:50% align:center
The day the Demon Lords
gather was named "Walpurgis"

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.014 position:50% align:center
by the Western Holy Church.

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.349 position:50% align:center
So, Walpurgis is when
Demon Lords get together

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center
to start a war?

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.227 position:50% align:center
What? Of course not!

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.396 position:50% align:center
Besides, I've got much more
important matters to attend to

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.064 position:50% align:center
then starting some stupid war.

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:35.316 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Like hang out in a maze all day.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.943 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not,
Walpurgis has been held

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:39.487 position:50% align:center
on several different occasions.

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:41.656 position:50% align:center
Basically, it's where all
the Demon Lords get together

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.575 position:50% align:center
to drink tea while
discussing urgent reports

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:45.118 position:50% align:center
and amusing topics.

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:47.203 position:50% align:center
So, It's very rarely
anything as dramatic as

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.788 position:50% align:center
starting a "great war."

00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:52.083 position:50% align:center
Okay, so then how would this
tea party doom Tempest to fall?

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:53.251 position:50% align:center
You're still not getting it!

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:55.670 position:50% align:center
The problem isn't
Walpurgis itself, dummy.

00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:57.380 position:50% align:center
It's what they'll be discussing!

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:58.381 position:50% align:center
Which is?

00:04:58.465 --> 00:04:59.799 position:50% align:center
Listen up.

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:01.468 position:50% align:center
In order to even hold Walpurgis,
it has to be approved

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.762 position:50% align:center
by at least three Demon Lords.

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:06.931 position:50% align:center
And the ones who gave Clayman
the approval this time...

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:10.352 position:50% align:center
...were Frey and Milim Nava.

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.020 position:50% align:center
Milim, huh?

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:13.396 position:50% align:center
And Frey...

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.231 position:50% align:center
[BOTH growls]

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.108 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS] The topic will be
the birth of a new power

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:19.069 position:50% align:center
in the Great Forest of Jura!

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:22.405 position:50% align:center
One whose leader proclaims
himself to be a Demon Lord!

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:23.573 position:50% align:center
Be honest with me--

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:26.201 position:50% align:center
Did you really make
that claim, Rimuru?

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:28.703 position:50% align:center
It's true,
and I have no regrets.

00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:30.914 position:50% align:center
Knowing you,
that's not surprising.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:33.124 position:50% align:center
Well, it's probably going
to bring you a lot of trouble,

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:36.211 position:50% align:center
but with the power you possess,
I suppose you'll be okay.

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:37.420 position:50% align:center
[GROUP grunts]

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:38.963 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
So, what's Clayman's goal?

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:40.924 position:50% align:center
He wants to punish me
or something?

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.425 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS]
I believe so.

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.094 position:50% align:center
In this business, it's an
unspoken rule that you're free

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:45.720 position:50% align:center
to punish whoever you want.

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:47.555 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Sure, "business."

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.224 position:50% align:center
Normally, Clayman would
handle that himself,

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:51.476 position:50% align:center
but instead,
he asked for Walpurgis.

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:53.812 position:50% align:center
Because of Demon Lord
Carrion's betrayal.

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:54.896 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:56.272 position:50% align:center
What are you saying?!

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.982 position:50% align:center
Who are those people...?

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:00.568 position:50% align:center
The Three Beastketeers
who serve Carrion.

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:02.070 position:50% align:center
[GROUP growls]

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:06.032 position:50% align:center
Oh? Well, snarling at the
messenger won't do you any good.

00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:09.411 position:50% align:center
Just what betrayal does he claim
Lord Carrion has committed?

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:12.539 position:50% align:center
He broke the non-aggression pact
with the Great Forest of Jura.

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:14.708 position:50% align:center
From what I heard, he then
informed you that the majin

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:17.961 position:50% align:center
known as Mjurran worked
for Demon Lord Clayman, right?

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:19.796 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Let me guess,
after he told me that,

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:22.090 position:50% align:center
I killed Mjurran, huh?

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:24.884 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:27.470 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Gotcha.

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:29.889 position:50% align:center
Is Clayman hoping to take over
the Forest of Jura?

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:31.307 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:33.727 position:50% align:center
How can you be so calm
when this is such a big deal?

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.187 position:50% align:center
Carrion was apparently
obliterated by Milim.

00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:37.981 position:50% align:center
And now Clayman has
ordered all of the majin

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:39.733 position:50% align:center
under his control to deploy!

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:43.445 position:50% align:center
Seriously? Sounds like he's
already making his move, then.

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:44.904 position:50% align:center
Damn that Clayman.

00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:47.115 position:50% align:center
The dude's even more cunning
than I first thought.

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:48.867 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS] Exactly!
That's why I keep asking you

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.202 position:50% align:center
how you can be so calm!

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:53.496 position:50% align:center
[grunts, pants]

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.081 position:50% align:center
Would you relax?

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:58.418 position:50% align:center
There's no need to panic, mostly
because I didn't kill Mjurran.

00:06:58.501 --> 00:06:59.836 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.629 position:50% align:center
For starters, it means
Clayman is selling you

00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:02.964 position:50% align:center
a big pack of lies.

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:05.216 position:50% align:center
Okay, can you prove that?

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.885 position:50% align:center
--[RIMURU chuckles]
--[RAMIRIS] Hmm?

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.308 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS]
Hmm?

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:16.353 position:50% align:center
Hi. Um, Demon Lord Ramiris?

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:19.314 position:50% align:center
The majin that he
allegedly murdered is me.

00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:20.357 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.692 position:50% align:center
I'm the majin known as Mjurran.

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:24.319 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS]
Huh...?

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:27.197 position:50% align:center
Hmm... Hmm?

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.825 position:50% align:center
Ah! Hmm... Mm...!

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:33.912 position:50% align:center
[groans]
Ah!

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:37.123 position:50% align:center
I get it now! So Clayman
is actually the bad guy!

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:38.375 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:41.044 position:50% align:center
Clayman! You thought
you could fool me, eh?

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:43.129 position:50% align:center
I'm the Great Detective Ramiris!

00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50% align:center
There's no way
you could ever fool me!

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.467 position:50% align:center
I'm the Queen of Spirits,
and despite my youthful looks,

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.886 position:50% align:center
I possess the wisdom
of many long years!

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:52.097 position:50% align:center
Just like a grandmother.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.683 position:50% align:center
This is the part where you say
I'm too cute to be a grandma!

00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:56.017 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Glad to see
that Ramiris has been

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:57.560 position:50% align:center
enjoying our manga.

Hey, Ramiris. There's something
I'd like to ask you.

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:02.315 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS]
Hmm? Yes, what is it?

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:05.360 position:50% align:center
You can ask Great Detective
Ramiris anything you want.

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:08.279 position:50% align:center
It seems Clayman took the bait
I offered by "killing" Mjurran,

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:10.115 position:50% align:center
and now he's making
his big move.

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:12.867 position:50% align:center
But what do you think
the other Demon Lords will do?

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:14.119 position:50% align:center
[ERALD, GAZEL]
Hmm?

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:15.286 position:50% align:center
[GROUP sighs]

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.455 position:50% align:center
Huh? How should I know?

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:19.916 position:50% align:center
They were just like, "This
is why we're having Walpurgis,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.502 position:50% align:center
so you better show up,"
or something like that.

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:24.462 position:50% align:center
Okay, then, when is Walpurgis?

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:26.256 position:50% align:center
Do you at least know when
they're having the meeting?

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:29.009 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS]
Let's see... One, two...

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:31.302 position:50% align:center
In three days, on the night
of the new moon.

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:33.096 position:50% align:center
That's pretty soon.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.431 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] It'd be tough
to take out Clayman

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.307 position:50% align:center
with only three days to do it.

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:38.768 position:50% align:center
So, in that case, I guess the
battle would have to take place

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.645 position:50% align:center
after Walpurgis.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:42.897 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Why did you come
to tell me about this?

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:44.899 position:50% align:center
Because if you end up dead...

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.611 position:50% align:center
...who knows what'll happen
to my sweet Beretta?

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:50.822 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA] I appreciate
your concern for me.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.616 position:50% align:center
Look, the point is, I'm here
because I've made up my mind

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.910 position:50% align:center
to take your side
in this battle!

00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:57.787 position:50% align:center
So, I'm sure you don't mind
if I make a new entrance

00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:59.497 position:50% align:center
to my Labyrinth here, do you?

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:01.249 position:50% align:center
Yes, I do mind!

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:05.211 position:50% align:center
Wha--?! It's not a big deal, no
need to sweat the small stuff.

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:08.631 position:50% align:center
I will absolutely sweat them,
and so should you!

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:09.924 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS]
Fine, I'll keep reading.

00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:12.010 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:14.179 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] It looked as if our
meeting wasn't gonna be over

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:18.475 position:50% align:center
anytime soon, so we decided to
take a break for a little while.

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:25.231 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS giggling]
Cut it out, that tickles!

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:28.735 position:50% align:center
Enough! I can do
it myself, 'kay?

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:31.279 position:50% align:center
Lady Ramiris.
There's no need to be shy.

00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:33.114 position:50% align:center
Yes. Please allow
my sister and I

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:34.991 position:50% align:center
to wash you--it'd be an honor!

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:36.701 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS giggling]

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:38.745 position:50% align:center
[TREYNI]
Do you itch anywhere, my lady?

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:40.789 position:50% align:center
[TRYA]
Come now, it's my turn!

00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:42.707 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I didn't know Trya was here.

00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:45.752 position:50% align:center
Sounds like they're having
a lot of fun over there.

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:48.630 position:50% align:center
I should've gone over
to that side...

00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:54.260 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:57.180 position:50% align:center
I have to admit,
this is pretty amazing.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:10:00.141 position:50% align:center
Yep. Absolutely perfect.

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU groans]

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:05.605 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL] Wait... Can you feel
that in a homunculus body?

00:10:05.689 --> 00:10:07.273 position:50% align:center
[ERALD chuckles]

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.237 position:50% align:center
Hey, Eren! How's the water
feel over there?

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:14.948 position:50% align:center
[thunk]

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:15.990 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:17.575 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU groans]

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:20.036 position:50% align:center
[ERALD]
Aw... She's being shy.

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:25.750 position:50% align:center
Uh By the way, Master Rimuru.

00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:27.335 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
What's up, my guy?

00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:29.462 position:50% align:center
I wanted to propose building a
road that would directly connect

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:31.089 position:50% align:center
Tempest to my nation.

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:33.967 position:50% align:center
It'd certainly make travel
between the two much easier.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.510 position:50% align:center
Do you have any thoughts?

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:37.762 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Yeah, I'm thinking
it sounds like you want us

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:39.514 position:50% align:center
to build the road.

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:41.057 position:50% align:center
Come now, Erald.

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:43.768 position:50% align:center
Don't you think you're asking
a little too much of Rimuru?

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:45.729 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Pretty rich coming
from the guy who sat back

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:48.982 position:50% align:center
while we did all the work on
the road to the Dwarven Kingdom.

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:50.859 position:50% align:center
You don't have
any room to talk here!

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:53.028 position:50% align:center
Only Master Rimuru
can say stuff like that!

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:54.779 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Well said, my man!

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:58.158 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
You know what?

00:10:58.241 --> 00:11:00.744 position:50% align:center
I totally agree
with the road thing.

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:03.455 position:50% align:center
We're willing to handle all
of the construction and stuff.

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:04.873 position:50% align:center
However...

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:06.416 position:50% align:center
However?

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.543 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I'd prefer that my
people handle guarding the road

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:10.170 position:50% align:center
and running any
lodging along it.

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:12.714 position:50% align:center
Those things both take money, so
naturally we'd need to collect

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:15.383 position:50% align:center
a toll to cover the expenses.

00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:19.095 position:50% align:center
A fair point. I would say
that's a reasonable demand.

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:21.765 position:50% align:center
Although I do have
one small counter proposal.

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:23.892 position:50% align:center
We'd like the right to negotiate
the amount of the toll

00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:25.310 position:50% align:center
every few years.

00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:27.062 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Sounds good! It's a deal, then.

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:28.229 position:50% align:center
It is?

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:30.899 position:50% align:center
My goodness.
You really do ask too much.

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:33.568 position:50% align:center
Once again, you really don't
have any room to talk here!

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.570 position:50% align:center
Well. That settles it.

00:11:37.781 --> 00:11:39.324 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU sighs]

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:46.456 position:50% align:center
[TRYA giggles]

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.541 position:50% align:center
[TREYNI giggling]

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:50.168 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS sighs]

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:51.628 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.592 position:50% align:center
[BERETTA]
Hmm?

00:11:57.676 --> 00:12:00.553 position:50% align:center
Question, do you rust...?

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:19.656 position:50% align:center
We all here?

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.032 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS]
Hey! What's the big idea?

00:12:21.116 --> 00:12:23.118 position:50% align:center
What the heck is
this all about, anyway?

00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:24.619 position:50% align:center
Wait, what do you mean?

00:12:24.703 --> 00:12:26.287 position:50% align:center
Uh, I'm talking about how these
girls are fawning over me

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:28.289 position:50% align:center
like crazy! They both adore me!

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:29.833 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Isn't that a good thing?

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:31.126 position:50% align:center
[BOTH giggle]

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:34.379 position:50% align:center
It is a good thing.
In fact, it's incredible!

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:35.755 position:50% align:center
My mind's made up!

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:38.133 position:50% align:center
I've decided that I'm going
to start living here!

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:40.510 position:50% align:center
Hate to break it to you,
but I did not agree to that.

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:42.804 position:50% align:center
Also, Treyni and her sisters
are already super busy

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:45.348 position:50% align:center
being the Great Forest
of Jura's caretakers.

00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:47.475 position:50% align:center
None of them actually live here.

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:49.519 position:50% align:center
Meaning they can't spend
all their time coddling you.

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:51.104 position:50% align:center
You're so stingy!

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:53.732 position:50% align:center
Ugh! If something bad happened,
then I, the great Ramiris,

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:55.108 position:50% align:center
would help them,
so there's no need to be

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:56.359 position:50% align:center
such a stick in the mud!

00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:57.819 position:50% align:center
Hey now...

00:12:57.902 --> 00:12:59.362 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru.

00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:02.115 position:50% align:center
My sisters and I would be happy
to look after Lady Ramiris.

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:05.201 position:50% align:center
Yes, please consider her
proposal favorably.

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:07.328 position:50% align:center
[TREYNI, TRYA]
Please give her your permission.

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:08.788 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:10.957 position:50% align:center
Okay, then. I'll think about it.

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:15.253 position:50% align:center
Really?! Yay, thank you!
I just knew you'd understand!

00:13:15.337 --> 00:13:17.297 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
All right, let's dig in already!

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.257 position:50% align:center
We'll talk while we eat.

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:23.553 position:50% align:center
--Here.
--[TREYNI giggling]

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:26.014 position:50% align:center
Oh my. It's good.

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:27.932 position:50% align:center
Yes, truly exquisite.

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:31.061 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Heh!

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:32.771 position:50% align:center
Don't mind if I do!

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:37.525 position:50% align:center
With this meeting dragging on,
I'm sure you're all tired,

00:13:37.609 --> 00:13:40.195 position:50% align:center
but try to bear with it
a bit longer, okay?

00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:42.489 position:50% align:center
By the way, Shion, I know
you've been interrogating

00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:46.117 position:50% align:center
the war prisoners--
Did you get any information?

00:13:46.201 --> 00:13:47.577 position:50% align:center
[SHION giggles]

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.871 position:50% align:center
Of course, I did, Lord Rimuru.

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:52.332 position:50% align:center
Ah?

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:53.416 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.335 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Uh...?

00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:59.964 position:50% align:center
Uh... Interrogation?
Questioning? Who knows?

00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:03.009 position:50% align:center
Whatever happened with them,
it did make them talk.

00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:04.678 position:50% align:center
Yes. That's true.

00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:07.514 position:50% align:center
But it wasn't like any
interrogation I've ever seen.

00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:08.848 position:50% align:center
Or a questioning--

00:14:08.932 --> 00:14:11.017 position:50% align:center
I'm actually not all that
sure what to call it.

00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:12.477 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU groans]

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.398 position:50% align:center
Right. First, uh,
Ed-something? Edmond?

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:18.191 position:50% align:center
Do you mean King Edmaris?

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:21.152 position:50% align:center
Yes. It seems King Edmaris
came into contact

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:23.238 position:50% align:center
with a traveling merchant.

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:25.240 position:50% align:center
The merchant apparently
brought silk goods

00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:27.992 position:50% align:center
and other various items
from our country into his,

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:29.786 position:50% align:center
which piqued the king's greed.

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:32.330 position:50% align:center
After that, the king feared
the primary source of goods

00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:34.791 position:50% align:center
in circulation would shift
from Falmuth to here,

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:37.252 position:50% align:center
which supposedly led
to the recent incident.

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:39.963 position:50% align:center
So, do we have any idea
who the merchant was?

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:41.464 position:50% align:center
Were they chartered
or something?

00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:44.676 position:50% align:center
That, I don't know.
I apologize, my lord.

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:48.179 position:50% align:center
No worries. So, anyone connected
to the Western Holy Church?

00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:51.474 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes! I managed to find out
who the mastermind was!

00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:53.059 position:50% align:center
What was his name...?

00:14:53.143 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50% align:center
Uh, the ringleader is...
Nickel... spoon...?

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.150 position:50% align:center
According to the info we got
from Archbishop Reyhiem,

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:03.445 position:50% align:center
the church's ringleader is known
as Cardinal Nikolaus Spertus.

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:04.446 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:05.947 position:50% align:center
From what we were
able to gather,

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:08.491 position:50% align:center
the cardinal's original plan
was to subjugate this nation

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:10.410 position:50% align:center
as one who is hostile
to their god.

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:12.370 position:50% align:center
Yep, that's what he told us!

00:15:12.454 --> 00:15:15.248 position:50% align:center
I get it now. Archbishop Reyhiem
just wanted the glory

00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:17.709 position:50% align:center
of defeating a godless enemy,
probably in hopes of earning

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:20.503 position:50% align:center
a more favorable reputation
with the higher ups.

00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:22.630 position:50% align:center
But since he didn't achieve
that, there still might be a way

00:15:22.714 --> 00:15:24.507 position:50% align:center
to negotiate with
the Western Holy Church

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:26.676 position:50% align:center
so we're not branded as enemies.

00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:31.097 position:50% align:center
Right. I'd be happy to
handle that task myself.

00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:33.183 position:50% align:center
Well, in that case,
the Armed Nation of Dwargon

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:34.851 position:50% align:center
will help by making
a grand declaration

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:36.519 position:50% align:center
of our trade with Tempest.

00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:38.271 position:50% align:center
[ERALD] And,.. Thalion
will officially announce

00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:42.067 position:50% align:center
its establishment of diplomatic
relations with this nation.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.320 position:50% align:center
If other nations begin to show
more interest in this country,

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:47.655 position:50% align:center
then the Western Holy Church
will have little to no choice

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:49.115 position:50% align:center
but to tread carefully.

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:50.992 position:50% align:center
Sweet. I'm counting on you.

00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:52.911 position:50% align:center
Just leave everything to us.

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:54.454 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA slurping]

00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:58.041 position:50% align:center
Aw, yeah! Thank you
for the amazing meal!

00:15:58.124 --> 00:16:00.293 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Okay. So, we're
going to say Youm rescued

00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:02.587 position:50% align:center
those three war prisoners, and
we'll arrange for them to have

00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:05.048 position:50% align:center
what looks like
a triumphant return.

00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:08.927 position:50% align:center
Wait. There's King Edmaris,
that Archbishop Reyhiem...

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.512 position:50% align:center
Who is the third prisoner?

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:13.473 position:50% align:center
Oh, it was the man who was
passed out from pure terror.

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.934 position:50% align:center
It was the last man
left alive, is that right?

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:17.686 position:50% align:center
That sounds like it
would have to be Folgen,

00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:19.771 position:50% align:center
the renowned captain
of the knights.

00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:21.731 position:50% align:center
You were the one who
captured him, Diablo.

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:23.483 position:50% align:center
Do you remember what
the dude was like?

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:25.985 position:50% align:center
Also, is he somebody you
think would be fine to let go?

00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:27.153 position:50% align:center
He's an utter weakling.

00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:28.947 position:50% align:center
I doubt he'll
cause any problems.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.449 position:50% align:center
Though I must admit, he did
seem to be relatively skilled

00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:33.118 position:50% align:center
with magic for a human.

00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:35.161 position:50% align:center
A magic user, you say?

00:16:35.245 --> 00:16:38.081 position:50% align:center
Well, in that case, he probably
isn't Folgen after all.

00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:39.207 position:50% align:center
What was his name?

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.291 position:50% align:center
It's Ramen.

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:41.876 position:50% align:center
Ramen, huh?

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.545 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,
it's been forever

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:46.506 position:50% align:center
since I had a good
bowl of ramen.

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:49.968 position:50% align:center
How odd. Was there a magic user
in Falmuth named Ramen?

00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:51.594 position:50% align:center
Now that I think on it,

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:54.431 position:50% align:center
Falmuth did have a majin
named Razen who used magic.

00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:55.432 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
Huh...?

00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:57.350 position:50% align:center
So, it's the champion Razen, eh?

00:16:57.434 --> 00:16:59.602 position:50% align:center
He is a majin who
must be taken seriously.

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:00.645 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:02.313 position:50% align:center
He has quite the reputation.

00:17:02.397 --> 00:17:04.983 position:50% align:center
He's known as the guardian
of Falmuth and the Wise Majin.

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:06.026 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:08.153 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes, the man
who mastered magic!

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:10.530 position:50% align:center
Truth is, I've always wanted to
go head-to-head with the guy!

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:12.699 position:50% align:center
Well, I feel quite confident
that I could beat him

00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:15.577 position:50% align:center
in close combat. But he's
definitely not the kind of human

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.620 position:50% align:center
you can let your
guard down around.

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:20.665 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Hmm... Hey, are you positive

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:22.459 position:50% align:center
this guy's name is Ramen?

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:24.836 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh. Yes?

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:26.880 position:50% align:center
Let's see, he's a young man...

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:30.342 position:50% align:center
It was him! He was one of the
travelers who attacked the city!

00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:33.636 position:50% align:center
No way he's the powerful
magic user they say!

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.680 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
What's going on here?

00:17:35.764 --> 00:17:38.516 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Notice.
Using a secret soul magic ritual

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.227 position:50% align:center
can allow one to possess
another person's body.

00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:43.813 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I'm starting to
think his name isn't Ramen.

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:44.898 position:50% align:center
[MJURRAN]
E-Excuse me...

00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:46.024 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:48.693 position:50% align:center
They're right.
His name is Razen.

00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:49.861 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I knew it!

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:51.446 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:53.114 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO chuckles]

00:17:53.198 --> 00:17:55.742 position:50% align:center
Hold on just a moment, did you
seriously manage to capture

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:58.078 position:50% align:center
the champion who protected
the Kingdom of Falmuth

00:17:58.161 --> 00:17:59.537 position:50% align:center
for centuries?

00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:01.956 position:50% align:center
He was a human whose skill
as a wizard rivaled my own.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.834 position:50% align:center
I dare say he might have been
even more extraordinary.

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:06.795 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]

00:18:06.878 --> 00:18:08.630 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] And yet,
Diablo managed to use the guy

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:11.174 position:50% align:center
as his personal punching bag.

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:12.634 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Okay, Youm?

00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:14.010 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center
Here's what we'll do.
We'll "free" the prisoners.

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.390 position:50% align:center
And then you're going to
escort them back to Falmuth

00:18:18.473 --> 00:18:21.601 position:50% align:center
to get our grand plan rolling.
Diablo will go with you.

00:18:21.685 --> 00:18:23.228 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO gasps]

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:24.813 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
Hmph!

00:18:24.896 --> 00:18:26.940 position:50% align:center
It's the best option
if we're going to start a war

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:28.483 position:50% align:center
against Clayman.

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:31.152 position:50% align:center
Since Veldora is going to stay
behind and protect the town,

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:34.280 position:50% align:center
I wasn't sure who I was going
to send to back up Youm's group.

00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:37.534 position:50% align:center
You're the perfect candidate!
I'm counting on you.

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:41.162 position:50% align:center
Right. It would be
my pleasure, Lord Rimuru.

00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:43.248 position:50% align:center
Look, this mission
could take a few years.

00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:44.791 position:50% align:center
Don't rush things.

00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:46.251 position:50% align:center
Not a problem, sir.

00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:49.212 position:50% align:center
I shall handle this task
well before the allotted time.

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:53.008 position:50% align:center
That's some real confidence in
our ability to topple a nation.

00:18:53.091 --> 00:18:57.470 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] But, that's also why I
know I can trust him with this.

00:18:57.554 --> 00:19:00.974 position:50% align:center
Now, in regards to the whole
war against Clayman issue.

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:03.643 position:50% align:center
Ramiris here was kind enough
to warn me that, apparently,

00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:05.478 position:50% align:center
I've become his primary target.

00:19:05.562 --> 00:19:08.231 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS gasps]
Ahem-hem!

00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:10.567 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] You're so
kind-hearted, Lady Ramiris!

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:11.943 position:50% align:center
[RAMIRIS chuckles]

00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:15.947 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Hmm?

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:18.450 position:50% align:center
Soei.

00:19:18.533 --> 00:19:19.993 position:50% align:center
[SOEI]
Yes?

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:21.661 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Give me a report on
what Clayman's army is doing.

00:19:21.745 --> 00:19:23.747 position:50% align:center
Right. I will show you.

00:19:25.457 --> 00:19:28.918 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:31.212 position:50% align:center
[SOEI] His army numbers
about 30,000.

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:32.505 position:50% align:center
They are currently
organizing within

00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:34.966 position:50% align:center
Demon Lord Milim's territory.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.178 position:50% align:center
Thirty thousand?
That's manageable enough.

00:19:38.261 --> 00:19:39.929 position:50% align:center
[SOEI] In my scouting,
I discovered that Clayman

00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
doesn't appear to be
leading the army himself.

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:43.099 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
It's a man in the army.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:47.479 position:50% align:center
The one who possesses
the most magicules.

00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:51.649 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
So that's their commander, huh?

00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:53.109 position:50% align:center
[MJURRAN]
The Middle Finger, Yamza.

00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:54.569 position:50% align:center
Say what now?

00:19:54.652 --> 00:19:56.905 position:50% align:center
Oh. Sorry, I forgot to tell you.

00:19:56.988 --> 00:19:59.157 position:50% align:center
The strongest of Clayman's
many subordinates are known as

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.825 position:50% align:center
the Five Fingers.

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:02.452 position:50% align:center
The Middle Finger, Yamza.

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:04.245 position:50% align:center
The Index Finger, Adalman.

00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:05.830 position:50% align:center
The Thumb is Nine Head.

00:20:05.914 --> 00:20:09.125 position:50% align:center
The Pinky Finger, Pirone.

00:20:09.209 --> 00:20:11.961 position:50% align:center
And I was... the Ring Finger.

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:13.838 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU sighs]

00:20:13.922 --> 00:20:15.715 position:50% align:center
[MJURRAN] You see, Yamza
received a magic sword

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:18.218 position:50% align:center
with hidden ice
powers from Clayman.

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:20.720 position:50% align:center
He's known as the
Magic Swordsman of Ice.

00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:23.139 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
The Magic Swordsman of Ice, huh?

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:25.183 position:50% align:center
[MJURRAN]
He's cruel and he plays dirty.

00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:27.686 position:50% align:center
He's practically
a master of immorality.

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:29.771 position:50% align:center
And his skills
are the real deal.

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:33.441 position:50% align:center
Since Yamza swore his loyalty
to Clayman of his own free will,

00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:36.236 position:50% align:center
he and I didn't exactly
get along that well.

00:20:36.319 --> 00:20:38.446 position:50% align:center
He's the strongest
of the Five Fingers.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.073 position:50% align:center
That's good to know.

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:41.866 position:50% align:center
But fortunately, I don't
think we'll have too much

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:44.494 position:50% align:center
to fear from him.

00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:46.788 position:50% align:center
Clayman is the prudent type.

00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:49.332 position:50% align:center
I'm almost positive he already
knows that the Animal Kingdom's

00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:51.960 position:50% align:center
Warrior Brigade is
staying here in our city.

00:20:52.043 --> 00:20:54.879 position:50% align:center
Given that, an army
of 30,000 is way too weak.

00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:56.464 position:50% align:center
It does seem quite strange.

00:20:56.548 --> 00:20:58.925 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I have to agree.

00:21:00.218 --> 00:21:01.636 position:50% align:center
Perhaps we're mistaken, then.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.346 position:50% align:center
And Clayman's
target isn't our city.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.515 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center
Interesting.
That's a possibility.

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:09.978 position:50% align:center
I was convinced he was
coming after Tempest,

00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:11.271 position:50% align:center
but maybe he's not.

00:21:11.354 --> 00:21:13.440 position:50% align:center
So, what could he be after?

00:21:16.735 --> 00:21:18.361 position:50% align:center
The Animal Kingdom...?

[gasps]

00:21:19.529 --> 00:21:21.573 position:50% align:center
Are you saying Clayman's
after Eurazania?

00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:23.867 position:50% align:center
Why though?
The capital's destroyed.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.368 position:50% align:center
The only people left
are the refugees

00:21:25.452 --> 00:21:27.078 position:50% align:center
in surrounding
towns and villages.

00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:29.289 position:50% align:center
What would be
the purpose of that?

00:21:29.372 --> 00:21:31.041 position:50% align:center

Hmm...

[RAPHAEL] Answer:
One can speculate that

00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:35.337 position:50% align:center
Demon Lord Clayman's
ultimate goal is to awaken

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.796 position:50% align:center
as a True Demon Lord.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.340 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]

00:21:38.423 --> 00:21:40.300 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] I do not believe this
town factors into his plan.

00:21:40.383 --> 00:21:42.844 position:50% align:center
However, his methods are
immature, as they require him

00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:45.513 position:50% align:center
to destroy the remaining life
in Eurazania based on

00:21:45.597 --> 00:21:47.557 position:50% align:center
an inaccurate inference.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.933 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Most likely...

00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:51.478 position:50% align:center
...Clayman wants to massacre
the remaining refugees.

00:21:51.561 --> 00:21:54.022 position:50% align:center
Then he'd be able to awaken
as a True Demon Lord.

[RIMURU]
Mm...

00:21:59.402 --> 00:22:00.612 position:50% align:center
That would make sense.

00:22:00.695 --> 00:22:02.364 position:50% align:center
Clayman must know
the Three Beastketeers

00:22:02.447 --> 00:22:05.950 position:50% align:center
and Carrion's main army are
taking refuge here in Tempest.

00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:08.036 position:50% align:center
That gives him the perfect
chance to overrun

00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:09.287 position:50% align:center
the Animal Kingdom.

00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:10.789 position:50% align:center
Based on the
information we have,

00:22:10.872 --> 00:22:14.125 position:50% align:center
Clayman's army will likely reach
Eurazania within two days.

00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:16.544 position:50% align:center
Damn it all! We'll never
get back there in time!

00:22:16.628 --> 00:22:17.754 position:50% align:center
[PHOBIO snarls]

00:22:17.837 --> 00:22:20.131 position:50% align:center
Guess he got a step ahead of us.

00:22:20.215 --> 00:22:22.425 position:50% align:center
Damn that Clayman...
