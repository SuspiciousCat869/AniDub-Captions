It's over!

Awaken, Gluttony!

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:28.361 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE]
Complete. Order accepted.

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:30.405 position:50% align:center
Executing immediately.

I don't believe it.

[PREDATOR RIMURU growling]

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:20.056 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
I see.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.767 position:50% align:center
This is a form
specialized for combat.

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:25.603 position:50% align:center
It incorporates traits
from various monsters.

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:26.604 position:50% align:center
[PREDATOR RIMURU roars]

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:28.523 position:50% align:center
So that's your game.

[PREDATOR RIMURU roars]

00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:42.328 position:50% align:center
And... since my
Dead End Rainbow attack

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:44.622 position:50% align:center
failed to finish you off...

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:46.207 position:50% align:center
...it means you have no soul.

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:47.917 position:50% align:center
[PREDATOR RIMURU growls]

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.169 position:50% align:center
Fine.

Still not enough to stop you?

[HINATA]
Spirit summon!

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:30.085 position:50% align:center
[HINATA] Let me provide you
with a prayer to the divine.

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:34.005 position:50% align:center
I hope for and desire the power
of all the holy spirits.

[PREDATOR RIMURU growls]

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:44.349 position:50% align:center
Listen to my appeal.
Overcome your obstacles!

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:53.733 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
Put an end to this.

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:55.819 position:50% align:center
Disintegration!

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:30.061 position:50% align:center
I have avenged you, Miss Shizu.

At long last, I made it out!

00:04:58.423 --> 00:04:59.674 position:50% align:center
Please tell me
you're all right, Master!

00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:00.842 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU screams]

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:02.177 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Master!

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.470 position:50% align:center
--[RIMURU] I'm fine, Ranga!
--[RANGA] Master!

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:06.681 position:50% align:center
--Calm down, dude!
--[whining]

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:09.934 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] No doubt, things were
getting pretty dicey back there.

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:17.650 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] This isn't working.
She's too freakin' strong!

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:20.236 position:50% align:center
That was close. It's impressive
that you can move

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.739 position:50% align:center
so well inside this barrier.

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:24.866 position:50% align:center
Frankly, I had sold you short.

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.911 position:50% align:center
Still. You won't
leave here alive.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:31.581 position:50% align:center
Because you can kill me
with just one more strike?

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:33.416 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I definitely
wasn't expecting a fight

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.418 position:50% align:center
that I had no hope of winning.

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:38.672 position:50% align:center
Regardless, I will keep
fighting, even if it's in vain.

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:40.799 position:50% align:center
I may be a slime,
but I'm not so soft

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:43.134 position:50% align:center
that I'd just roll over and die!

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:44.219 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE]
Notice.

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:45.887 position:50% align:center
Using the unique
skill "Degenerate,"

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.889 position:50% align:center
the higher-level
elemental known as Ifrit

00:05:47.972 --> 00:05:50.225 position:50% align:center
has been separated
into a pure spirit.

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:51.518 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
All right!

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:55.480 position:50% align:center
Defeat my enemy!
Superior spirit of fire, Ifrit!

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:58.274 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.954 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Making a body
double and am-scraying

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:14.082 position:50% align:center
was a really good call.

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:16.167 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I'm not too proud to run.

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:19.879 position:50% align:center
Hinata's strong, though!
That girl is a beast.

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:23.925 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Even without Holy
Field, I still might've lost.

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.137 position:50% align:center
Her "Disintegration"
move is just too OP.

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:36.896 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Avoiding an attack
that huge has to be impossible.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.815 position:50% align:center
I wonder if Milim
could survive it.

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:40.984 position:50% align:center
I should ask her sometime.

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.610 position:50% align:center
Man, damn that Hinata lady!

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:44.112 position:50% align:center
She wouldn't let me
explain anything!

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:46.239 position:50% align:center
She just had to start
an all-out brawl!

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:47.907 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] I'm not really
sure what happened,

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:50.660 position:50% align:center
but I think it's fair to say
you won this battle, Master!

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:52.912 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] For real, you and I
are on the same page!

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:54.664 position:50% align:center
But I mean, if Hinata
wants to split hairs,

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:56.666 position:50% align:center
I guess we could call it
a draw or whatever.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.126 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Don't be ridiculous!

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:01.212 position:50% align:center
It's easy to see that you
had an overwhelming victory!

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:02.630 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Uh, sure.

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:04.090 position:50% align:center
Anyway, we gotta hurry home!

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:06.176 position:50% align:center
I'm worried about
the goblinhood.

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:09.012 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Tempest, please!

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:11.097 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Right!

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:12.098 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Huh?

00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:14.184 position:50% align:center
[wind howls]

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.852 position:50% align:center
--[RANGA] Uh?
--[RIMURU] What's wrong?

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:18.480 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE] Notice:
Specified destination not found.

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:19.939 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Huh?!

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:21.524 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE] It appears that
Tempest has been isolated

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:24.444 position:50% align:center
from the rest of the world by
some sort of special barrier.

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:26.196 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Aw, man, that can't be good.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.697 position:50% align:center
Is there another
place near Tempest

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:29.824 position:50% align:center
that we can jump to, instead?

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:31.368 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE]
Searching...

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:32.494 position:50% align:center
I have a hit.

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:34.162 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Awesome, let's go!

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:35.580 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Uhh?

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:39.501 position:50% align:center
[GABIRU] I'm telling you, I can
break through it with my attack!

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:40.502 position:50% align:center
[SOUEI]
No.

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:41.503 position:50% align:center
I'll try again.

00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:42.754 position:50% align:center
[GABIRU]
But Souei--

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:44.923 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:46.591 position:50% align:center
[GABIRU]
It's Lord Rimuru!

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:49.302 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Hmm?

00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:51.930 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru.
I am glad to see you're safe.

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:53.264 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Thanks.

00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:56.976 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Forget me, what in
the heck happened to you?!

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.396 position:50% align:center
Nothing, these are
but mere scratches.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.649 position:50% align:center
[VESTA panting]

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:06.027 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank goodness you're back!

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:07.696 position:50% align:center
Drink this potion.

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:11.950 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] So, what's
the deal with Tempest?

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:14.202 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid we don't
have any answers.

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:15.787 position:50% align:center
[GABIRU]
I'm worried.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.123 position:50% align:center
I can't get in touch with any of
my men that I sent into town.

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:19.791 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:22.627 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU whimpers]

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:24.504 position:50% align:center
There's a barrier
or something interfering.

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:26.381 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
So it's true.

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:28.717 position:50% align:center
[SOKA] Master Souei actually
tried to destroy part of

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.094 position:50% align:center
the barrier and enter
the city earlier.

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:32.762 position:50% align:center
That's how he got injured.

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:34.014 position:50% align:center
[SOUEI]
Enough, Soka.

00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:35.348 position:50% align:center
I'll be fine.

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:36.933 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:39.269 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] If Souei couldn't break
through it with his abilities,

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.396 position:50% align:center
then this barrier
must be crazy strong.

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:42.647 position:50% align:center
Who's responsible?

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:44.941 position:50% align:center
Well, my lord.
We think humans.

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:47.027 position:50% align:center
From the Kingdom of Falmuth.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.570 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:53.408 position:50% align:center
I was able to confirm that they
have initiated military actions.

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:56.036 position:50% align:center
A large army is headed
toward Tempest.

00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:58.663 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU grunts]
There's no time to waste!

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.877 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.047 position:50% align:center
Whoa, that barrier's enormous!

00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:12.927 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Great Sage. Use Analyze.

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.264 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE]
Answer.

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:19.017 position:50% align:center
Great magic confirmed,
originating inside the barrier.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.393 position:50% align:center
Anti-Magic Area.

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:22.729 position:50% align:center
There is also reduced
magicule density due to

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:24.481 position:50% align:center
the effects of
the outer barrier.

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:26.566 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
"Reduced magicule density"?

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:28.985 position:50% align:center
Is it the same as
Hinata's Holy Field?

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:30.445 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE]
Negative.

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:32.280 position:50% align:center
The principle is the same,
but its purification ability

00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:34.449 position:50% align:center
is weaker, so it is inferior.

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:36.993 position:50% align:center
It can be resisted
with Multilayer Barrier.

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:38.912 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Great magic from the inside

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:42.707 position:50% align:center
and holy magic from the outside.
So it's a two-layered assault.

00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:45.126 position:50% align:center
Who could have
done this, and why?

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.504 position:50% align:center
Listen up. I'll break inside
and stop whoever's casting

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:48.713 position:50% align:center
the great magic.

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:50.298 position:50% align:center
You guys go and find
the one who's erecting

00:09:50.382 --> 00:09:51.675 position:50% align:center
the other barrier.

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:53.343 position:50% align:center
--Yes, sir.
--We will.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.470 position:50% align:center
Be careful,
and don't engage them.

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:58.139 position:50% align:center
I just want you to find out
who they are, okay?

00:09:58.223 --> 00:10:00.517 position:50% align:center
All right. And how
should we contact you?

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.353 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Hmm? Hmm...

00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:08.066 position:50% align:center
With this, we should be able
to use Thought Communication,

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:09.859 position:50% align:center
even if I'm on the inside.

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:11.236 position:50% align:center

You think you've
seen me lose my cool?

If that were the case,
you'd be dead.

nothing left here but ashes.

What's happening here?

00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:39.277 position:50% align:center
It's this barrier.

00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:41.154 position:50% align:center
It blocks the use of magic,

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:43.782 position:50% align:center
and it has reduced
our abilities as well.

00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:46.326 position:50% align:center
Because of it,
we've lost a lot of people--

realized we were weakened,

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:01.049 position:50% align:center
we realized it was her magic.

00:14:02.926 --> 00:14:05.720 position:50% align:center
When we located the caster
and tried to capture her,

00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:07.722 position:50% align:center
Youm chose to stand in our way,

00:14:07.806 --> 00:14:11.059 position:50% align:center
and we were forced
to engage in combat.

from when we first met...

There are three rules.

Please do your best
to follow them.

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:14.617 position:50% align:center
First, no attacking humans.

Second, no fighting
amongst yourselves.

Third, no belittling
other races.

as Anti-Magic Field alone

could not cause this
degree of weakening.

00:18:31.528 --> 00:18:33.363 position:50% align:center
Sure, I'd appreciate that.

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:34.906 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:18:37.409 --> 00:18:40.036 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I received a report on
what had transpired in Tempest

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.204 position:50% align:center
while I was away.

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:47.877 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:52.132 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Mysterious attackers...

00:18:52.215 --> 00:18:53.550 position:50% align:center
And...

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:56.052 position:50% align:center
Knights from Falmuth.

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:58.513 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU growls]
If this hadn't weakened us,

00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:00.682 position:50% align:center
then Hakurou would
have never fallen.

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:02.475 position:50% align:center
He what?! Like, he lost?!

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:05.061 position:50% align:center
[RIGURD clears throat]
Yes, he was severely injured,

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
but thankfully, he'll recover.

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:08.732 position:50% align:center
Lady Shuna is treating
both him and Gobta,

00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:10.942 position:50% align:center
who was also wounded
badly in the fight.

00:19:11.026 --> 00:19:12.444 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:19:12.527 --> 00:19:15.321 position:50% align:center
Then, as the knights from
Falmuth were leaving Tempest...

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:23.371 position:50% align:center
This city has been
contaminated by monsters!

00:19:23.455 --> 00:19:25.498 position:50% align:center
As the chosen
protectors of humanity,

00:19:25.582 --> 00:19:28.835 position:50% align:center
we refuse to recognize
a nation built by monsters!

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:31.755 position:50% align:center
Therefore, we will consult with
the Western Holy Church

00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:34.883 position:50% align:center
regarding what must be done
about this unruly country.

00:19:34.966 --> 00:19:37.218 position:50% align:center
We will return
one week from today.

00:19:37.302 --> 00:19:39.846 position:50% align:center
When we do,
it'll be under our ruler.

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:42.140 position:50% align:center
Great King Edomalis himself!

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
It would be in your
best interest to surrender

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.227 position:50% align:center
and swear allegiance to him!

00:19:46.311 --> 00:19:47.812 position:50% align:center
If you refuse us,

00:19:47.896 --> 00:19:51.524 position:50% align:center
then in the name of God, I will
eradicate every last one of you!

00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:54.277 position:50% align:center
What a farce.

00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:56.988 position:50% align:center
Yes. An elaborate charade.

00:19:57.989 --> 00:19:59.532 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
Your city's in my way.

00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:00.950 position:50% align:center
Not for long.

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:03.286 position:50% align:center
Since I intend to destroy it.

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.413 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] The Western Holy Church
and the Kingdom of Falmuth

00:20:05.497 --> 00:20:07.457 position:50% align:center
have been colluding
from the start.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.168 position:50% align:center
I had to make a guess, I'd say
the Church has it in for us

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:11.336 position:50% align:center
because their doctrine doesn't

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:13.797 position:50% align:center
condone the existence
of monsters.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.966 position:50% align:center
But then, what's in it for
the Kingdom of Falmuth?

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.260 position:50% align:center
If you don't mind,
I think I know the reason.

00:20:19.344 --> 00:20:21.346 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps, grunts]

00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:24.140 position:50% align:center
As we speak, a new trade route
is coming into existence

00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:25.892 position:50% align:center
with your country at its center.

00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:28.436 position:50% align:center
The rise of Tempest has
created unprecedented reform

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.646 position:50% align:center
in commerce.

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:30.772 position:50% align:center
Meaning what?

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:32.607 position:50% align:center
Well, trade routes
are quite important.

00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:34.609 position:50% align:center
Even imposing a small
tariff could create

00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:36.736 position:50% align:center
the potential for
an enormous profit.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.447 position:50% align:center
Yes, the Kingdom of Falmuth is
notorious for being a country

00:20:39.531 --> 00:20:41.032 position:50% align:center
that heavily profits from trade.

00:20:41.116 --> 00:20:43.576 position:50% align:center
It's like a gateway to
the Western Provinces.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.122 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU grunts] Ah, so a profit
for Tempest equals a loss

00:20:47.205 --> 00:20:49.207 position:50% align:center
for the Kingdom
of Falmuth, right?

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:52.168 position:50% align:center
--Correct.
--A tremendous one, at that.

00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:53.878 position:50% align:center
I get it now.

00:20:53.962 --> 00:20:56.047 position:50% align:center
I've been playing
with fire this whole time,

00:20:56.131 --> 00:20:57.966 position:50% align:center
and I didn't even know it.

00:20:59.843 --> 00:21:00.885 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Mjolmire.

00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:01.886 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:03.555 position:50% align:center
Here's what we're gonna do.

00:21:03.638 --> 00:21:05.765 position:50% align:center
First off, update the
Kingdom of Blummund

00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:07.392 position:50% align:center
on our current situation.

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:10.186 position:50% align:center
Please let them know that we're
about to face Falmuth's army.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.688 position:50% align:center
Right. Yes.

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:14.149 position:50% align:center
I will impress upon them that
Tempest has done no wrong.

00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:15.567 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:18.236 position:50% align:center
In that case,
I shall take my leave.

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:22.449 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Which brings us back to Myulan.

00:21:22.532 --> 00:21:24.534 position:50% align:center
I think it's time you told us
the truth about why

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:28.621 position:50% align:center
you messed with us.
Don't leave out any details.

00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:30.373 position:50% align:center
[MYULAN grunts]

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:31.624 position:50% align:center
Myulan...

00:21:31.708 --> 00:21:34.502 position:50% align:center
It's all right.
I have nothing left to hide now.

00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:44.679 position:50% align:center
My name's Myulan and I serve
the Demon Lord Clayman.

00:21:44.763 --> 00:21:47.640 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:49.601 position:50% align:center
A Demon Lord?

00:21:58.526 --> 00:22:00.236 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.656 position:50% align:center
So Demon Lord Clayman
is the one pulling the strings.

00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:56.436 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE]
Next time, "Hope."
