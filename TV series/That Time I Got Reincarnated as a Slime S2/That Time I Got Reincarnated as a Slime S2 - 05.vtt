[grunts]

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.333 align:middle
Good, you're alive.

00:00:34.417 --> 00:00:38.042 align:middle
[YOUM]
Sure am. In your lap.

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:41.083 align:middle
The master's beating
was worth it to end up here.

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:44.250 align:middle
[MYULAN] Words of a fool.
You're only a mere human, Youm.

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.542 align:middle
Your reckless actions
could kill you.

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:49.375 align:middle
Heh. You say that
as if you're not

00:00:49.458 --> 00:00:51.833 align:middle
a "mere human" yourself, Myulan.

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:53.375 align:middle
[MYULAN gasps]

00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:55.292 align:middle
This is a comfy pillow.

00:00:55.375 --> 00:00:58.042 align:middle
Makes me wish I could wake up
like this every morning.

00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:00.667 align:middle
--[MYULAN grunts] Idiot.
--Ouch!

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.542 align:middle
[MYULAN] You're obviously
well enough for dumb jokes,

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:04.458 align:middle
so you can get off me.

00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:08.958 align:middle
We should return to town anyway.
We promised to practice magic.

00:01:09.042 --> 00:01:11.792 align:middle
We don't want to keep Rommel
and the others waiting, do we?

00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:14.583 align:middle
[YOUM]
Enough with the pushing.

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:16.625 align:middle
Just so you know,
it wasn't a joke.

00:01:16.708 --> 00:01:18.083 align:middle
[MYULAN gasps]

00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:23.875 align:middle
It wasn't...?

00:01:25.583 --> 00:01:27.500 align:middle
[MYULAN]
But... The Demon Lord Clayman

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:30.875 align:middle
completely controls my heart.

00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.375 align:middle
I'm his puppet--
nothing more.

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:42.083 align:middle
[MYULAN]
It's true. You are a fool.

00:03:17.292 --> 00:03:19.833 align:middle
[GIRL 29A] Lord Rimuru should
be returning any day now!

00:03:19.917 --> 00:03:22.708 align:middle
[WOMAN 29A] We'll have to be
sure to give him a big welcome.

00:03:27.167 --> 00:03:29.583 align:middle
Wow. The quality's amazing.

00:03:38.458 --> 00:03:42.875 align:middle
[KIDS laughing]

00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.167 align:middle
Huh? Hey, you kids
be more careful!

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.292 align:middle
If you don't watch where
you're going, you'll get hurt!

00:03:48.375 --> 00:03:49.958 align:middle
[LIZARDMAN 10H] Well,
at least if they do skin a knee,

00:03:50.042 --> 00:03:52.583 align:middle
we can heal them with
the high potions we made.

00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:55.083 align:middle
[LIZARDMAN 10F]
Hmm? Hi there, Myulan!

00:03:55.167 --> 00:03:56.583 align:middle
Are you doing well today?

00:03:56.667 --> 00:03:57.708 align:middle
[MYULAN]
Yes, thanks.

00:03:57.792 --> 00:03:59.583 align:middle
Sure is nice out, huh?

00:04:05.917 --> 00:04:07.542 align:middle
[MYULAN]
Hmm?

00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:10.125 align:middle
Why'd you stop,
is there something wrong?

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:13.125 align:middle
[LIZARDMAN 10G] Hmm... It's
nothing, sorry to hold you up.

00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:16.500 align:middle
[YOUM]
Bring it on, Grucius!

00:04:16.583 --> 00:04:18.000 align:middle
Is that all you've got?

00:04:18.083 --> 00:04:20.458 align:middle
[GRUCIUS grunting]

00:04:25.042 --> 00:04:26.458 align:middle
Not bad. If you
keep up this pace,

00:04:26.542 --> 00:04:27.958 align:middle
I might actually break a sweat!

00:04:28.042 --> 00:04:30.000 align:middle
Ha, ha! Good to know!

00:04:30.083 --> 00:04:31.417 align:middle
--Show 'em who's boss, Boss!
--You've got this, Youm!

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.750 align:middle
--We're counting on you!
--Don't let him get another hit!

00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:35.375 align:middle
[KAJIR]
Yeah! Just like that!

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:36.417 align:middle
[ROMMEL]
Nice block!

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.625 align:middle
[KAJIR]
Close one!

00:04:37.708 --> 00:04:40.208 align:middle
--On your left!
--[ROMMEL] Watch your back!

00:04:40.292 --> 00:04:43.917 align:middle
[CLAYMAN] I haven't heard
from you in a while, Myulan.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.917 align:middle
Are things going well?

00:04:47.875 --> 00:04:49.792 align:middle
[MYULAN]
Yes. They are, Lord Clayman.

00:04:49.875 --> 00:04:53.000 align:middle
I wasn't expecting
you to contact me.

00:04:53.083 --> 00:04:55.792 align:middle
[CLAYMAN] Excellent,
things are going well here, too.

00:04:55.875 --> 00:04:58.208 align:middle
Thanks to the information
you gave me.

00:04:58.292 --> 00:05:00.708 align:middle
In fact, I'm so pleased with
the current state of things

00:05:00.792 --> 00:05:04.625 align:middle
that I might even be willing
to return your heart to you.

00:05:04.708 --> 00:05:06.125 align:middle
[MYULAN]
Wait, does that mean...

00:05:06.208 --> 00:05:09.042 align:middle
...that you have
no further need for me?

00:05:09.125 --> 00:05:12.958 align:middle
[laughs]
I do love your sense of humor.

00:05:13.042 --> 00:05:16.583 align:middle
No, there is still a way
you can make yourself useful.

00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:19.875 align:middle
A new task that
only you can carry out.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.417 align:middle
You wouldn't dare refuse me,
would you, Myulan?

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.875 align:middle
I know you don't wish to die,
and it would be such a shame

00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.875 align:middle
if anything bad were to
happen to the man you love.

00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.500 align:middle
[MYULAN gasps] I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:05:34.583 --> 00:05:36.625 align:middle
[CLAYMAN]
Hmph. Yes, I'm sure.

00:05:36.708 --> 00:05:38.833 align:middle
Still, though.

00:05:38.917 --> 00:05:42.208 align:middle
It would be wise
not to underestimate me.

00:05:42.292 --> 00:05:46.167 align:middle
If you truly care about your
best interests--and his--

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.667 align:middle
you'll listen closely.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.875 align:middle
Continue to lay low.
Your new orders will come soon.

00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.917 align:middle
Once it's all over,
I shall set you free.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.792 align:middle
You might even get to
be with the man you love

00:05:57.875 --> 00:06:00.833 align:middle
outside of your dreams.

00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:05.458 align:middle
Is that true...?

00:06:11.417 --> 00:06:14.208 align:middle
[CLAYMAN]
I almost feel sorry for her.

00:06:14.292 --> 00:06:16.167 align:middle
[laughs]

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.208 align:middle
[MYULAN]
Is this a trap?

00:06:20.292 --> 00:06:21.958 align:middle
Of course it is.

00:06:25.167 --> 00:06:28.083 align:middle
[MYULAN]
But, if it means...

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.458 align:middle
[MYULAN] ...that my dream
could come true...

00:06:35.083 --> 00:06:39.625 align:middle
[MYULAN] ...then I will sell
my soul and become a demon.

00:06:43.417 --> 00:06:46.000 align:middle
A group of fully
armed humans, you say?

00:06:46.083 --> 00:06:48.917 align:middle
They're knights from
the Kingdom of Falmuth.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.583 align:middle
Heading for Tempest.

00:06:51.917 --> 00:06:54.458 align:middle
[SOUEI] It looks like
they are 100 strong.

00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:59.333 align:middle
While their objective is
unclear, it would appear

00:06:59.417 --> 00:07:02.625 align:middle
as though Falmuth is preparing
for some kind of battle.

00:07:02.708 --> 00:07:06.458 align:middle
[BENIMARU] Hmm. I doubt
they have noble intentions.

00:07:06.542 --> 00:07:09.458 align:middle
Yes, I agree. And Lord Rimuru?

00:07:09.542 --> 00:07:11.375 align:middle
He should be returning soon.

00:07:11.458 --> 00:07:12.750 align:middle
Perhaps we shouldn't wait.

00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:15.708 align:middle
It might be best to contact him
as a safety measure.

00:07:15.792 --> 00:07:16.958 align:middle
[BENIMARU]
Right.

00:07:17.042 --> 00:07:18.792 align:middle
[ALBIS]
Please respond.

00:07:18.875 --> 00:07:20.625 align:middle
[garbled]
Hello, is anyone--

00:07:20.708 --> 00:07:23.875 align:middle
...a Beastketeer from the
Aninmal Kingdom of Eurazania,

00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.833 align:middle
Albis, the Golden Serpent.

00:07:25.917 --> 00:07:27.083 align:middle
Lady Albis?

00:07:27.167 --> 00:07:28.708 align:middle
We can hear you. What is it?

00:07:28.792 --> 00:07:30.708 align:middle
[ALBIS garbled]
I have a request.

00:07:30.792 --> 00:07:33.250 align:middle
We need your country to take
in the people of our kingdom

00:07:33.333 --> 00:07:35.042 align:middle
as possible refugees.

00:07:35.125 --> 00:07:37.625 align:middle
Refugees? What happened?

00:07:37.708 --> 00:07:39.542 align:middle
[ALBIS]
In exactly one week from today,

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:41.167 align:middle
Eurazania goes to war.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.292 align:middle
Excuse me?

00:07:42.375 --> 00:07:43.792 align:middle
Which nation?

00:07:43.875 --> 00:07:46.000 align:middle
[ALBIS]
Not with a nation.

00:07:46.083 --> 00:07:48.000 align:middle
A person.

00:07:48.083 --> 00:07:49.875 align:middle
The Demon Lord Milim.

00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.667 align:middle
[gasping]

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.417 align:middle
What? For what reason, though?

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.000 align:middle
[ALBIS garbled]
...help shelter--

00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:56.375 align:middle

[GROUP sighing]

00:08:07.583 --> 00:08:10.792 align:middle
[SHOGO]
Hey. What the hell is this crap?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.208 align:middle
[SHOGO] This city is
even more developed than

00:08:13.292 --> 00:08:15.208 align:middle
that total trash pile, Falmuth!

00:08:15.292 --> 00:08:17.250 align:middle
Damn, this doesn't
make any sense!

00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:19.333 align:middle
Why are a bunch of stupid
monsters living better than

00:08:19.417 --> 00:08:20.583 align:middle
the three of us?

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.208 align:middle
It's just plain criminal!

00:08:22.292 --> 00:08:24.542 align:middle
Why do they get to live
in luxury while we suffer?

00:08:24.625 --> 00:08:26.250 align:middle
Ugh, it makes me wanna hurl.

00:08:26.333 --> 00:08:28.250 align:middle
Now, now, calm down, guys.

00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:31.000 align:middle
Still though. You're both right.

00:08:35.125 --> 00:08:37.042 align:middle
[KYOYA]
It does seem rather unfair.

00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:39.583 align:middle
Well, if their leader's a slime,
then we just gotta squash

00:08:39.667 --> 00:08:42.583 align:middle
the dumb thing, and the city
would be ours for the taking.

00:08:42.667 --> 00:08:45.333 align:middle
Great idea, Shogo!
You know I'm down!

00:08:45.417 --> 00:08:47.042 align:middle
I don't know, we probably
shouldn't take matters

00:08:47.125 --> 00:08:48.708 align:middle
into our own hands.

00:08:48.792 --> 00:08:50.500 align:middle
Nah, it'll be fine.

00:08:50.583 --> 00:08:52.417 align:middle
Besides, we were sent here
to stir up some trouble,

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.000 align:middle
am I right?
We're just following orders.

00:08:55.083 --> 00:08:56.500 align:middle
Exactly.

00:08:56.583 --> 00:08:58.667 align:middle
We want it on record that these
mean ol' monsters attacked

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.750 align:middle
us poor, innocent citizens.

00:09:00.833 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle
Fair enough. I suppose
that's in line

00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:04.667 align:middle
with what Lord Razen
wanted from us.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:07.375 align:middle
Ugh. You can drop that
"Lord" Razen bull crap.

00:09:07.458 --> 00:09:08.667 align:middle
Yeah, for real.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.167 align:middle
Lord Old Man Farts
would be better off dead.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.542 align:middle
At least that way we'd all
finally be free again.

00:09:13.625 --> 00:09:16.375 align:middle
[laughs]
I guess it's just a habit.

00:09:16.458 --> 00:09:18.417 align:middle
It would be bad if our true
feelings were to slip out

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.917 align:middle
while he was around.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.417 align:middle
More importantly...

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.792 align:middle
...let's get this thing started!

You jerk!

You just touched
my butt, didn't you?

00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.125 align:middle
I can't believe you'd
assault me out in the open!

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:45.417 align:middle
Hold on, I didn't
do anything like that!

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.625 align:middle
Please! Your dopey little act
isn't fooling anyone,

Hob-blob-lin! So why don't
you just come clean

00:09:49.833 --> 00:09:52.750 align:middle
already and tell everyone
why you assaulted me?

00:09:52.833 --> 00:09:54.250 align:middle
Out with it!

That hurt!

[MAN 29A]
You see that?

00:10:00.167 --> 00:10:02.125 align:middle
That Hobgoblin just
attacked the poor woman!

00:10:02.208 --> 00:10:03.375 align:middle
[MAN 29B]
Seriously?

00:10:03.458 --> 00:10:05.167 align:middle
Isn't he one of
the city's guards?

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.625 align:middle
How scary.

00:10:06.708 --> 00:10:09.250 align:middle
Here, I thought the monsters
in Tempest were friendly.

00:10:09.333 --> 00:10:12.417 align:middle
Once a monster,
always a monster.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.542 align:middle
[SHOGO] Kirara's unique skill
really is terrifying.

00:10:15.625 --> 00:10:17.292 align:middle
[KYOYA]
Yep. Her "Bewilder" ability

00:10:17.375 --> 00:10:19.708 align:middle
works on any target's
consciousness.

00:10:19.792 --> 00:10:23.000 align:middle
Forcing them to believe Kirara
and do whatever she demands.

00:10:23.083 --> 00:10:25.125 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:26.458 align:middle
[SHOGO]
What is this crap?

00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:29.250 align:middle
Do all your visitors get
attacked in this town?

00:10:29.333 --> 00:10:31.167 align:middle
I get it, now that they
have our business,

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.833 align:middle
they're not bothering
to hide their true colors.

00:10:33.917 --> 00:10:36.042 align:middle
[MAN 29C] The goblin does
look kind of suspicious, huh?

00:10:36.125 --> 00:10:38.083 align:middle
Yeah, he definitely did it.

00:10:38.167 --> 00:10:41.042 align:middle
[MAN 29D] Quick, someone
call the city guards!

00:10:41.125 --> 00:10:45.125 align:middle
[GOBZO] No, this is a mistake!
I didn't do anything, I swear!

00:10:45.208 --> 00:10:47.000 align:middle
[SHOGO] What Falmuth
wants is a valid reason

00:10:47.083 --> 00:10:49.250 align:middle
to invade this rancid country.

00:10:49.333 --> 00:10:53.375 align:middle
Something like a monster
attacking an innocent traveler.

00:10:53.458 --> 00:10:55.625 align:middle
If that derpy looking freak
gets mad and tries

00:10:55.708 --> 00:10:58.542 align:middle
to defend himself,
it'll be exactly what we need.

00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:00.167 align:middle
[GOBTA]
What's all the commotion about?

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:01.583 align:middle
Huh?

00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:03.208 align:middle
[GOBTA]
There a problem, Gobzo?

00:11:03.292 --> 00:11:05.000 align:middle
[GOBZO]
Oh, thank goodness!

00:11:05.083 --> 00:11:07.833 align:middle
[GOBTA] You sure do have a knack
for getting into trouble, huh?

00:11:11.167 --> 00:11:15.333 align:middle
[GOBTA] We apologize.
I'll make sure he's punished.

00:11:15.417 --> 00:11:17.625 align:middle
[GOBZO]
But, sir... I didn't do it.

00:11:17.708 --> 00:11:19.000 align:middle
[GOBTA]
I know you didn't.

00:11:19.083 --> 00:11:20.750 align:middle
It doesn't make
any difference, though.

00:11:20.833 --> 00:11:24.083 align:middle
There's nothing we can
do about their claims.

00:11:24.167 --> 00:11:27.917 align:middle
Wait a minute, are you saying
you actually believe me, Gobta?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.542 align:middle
Aw, c'mon now, I'm surprised
you even have to ask.

00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:33.375 align:middle
[GOBZO]
I'll follow you forever, sir!

00:11:33.458 --> 00:11:35.667 align:middle
Cut it out, Gobzo,
you're making a scene!

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.708 align:middle
Whoa, hold on for a second!

00:11:37.792 --> 00:11:39.458 align:middle
Are you trying to suggest
that I'm just making

00:11:39.542 --> 00:11:40.708 align:middle
the whole thing up?

00:11:40.792 --> 00:11:43.292 align:middle
Uh. I mean, it's pretty
obvious you are.

00:11:43.375 --> 00:11:47.125 align:middle
Ah! Oh, wow, you've got some
nerve for a pathetic Goblin!

00:11:47.208 --> 00:11:49.417 align:middle
How dare you try to make
a liar out of me!

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.750 align:middle
You weren't even
here when it happened,

00:11:50.833 --> 00:11:53.042 align:middle
so why do you believe
that stupid gremlin?!

00:11:53.125 --> 00:11:55.167 align:middle
Simple, in this country,
we trust our friends.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.708 align:middle
Oh, get real! That's the lamest
BS I've ever heard in my life!

00:11:58.792 --> 00:12:01.875 align:middle
Sorry, lady, the truth is Gobzo
only has eyes for Shion.

00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.042 align:middle
--Ah?!
--She's got a huge...

00:12:04.125 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle
...personality.

00:12:05.333 --> 00:12:07.500 align:middle
It's great. Seriously,
there's no way

00:12:07.583 --> 00:12:09.625 align:middle
he'd be interested
in someone as plain as you.

00:12:09.708 --> 00:12:11.375 align:middle
[KIRARA whimpers]

00:12:11.458 --> 00:12:14.083 align:middle
Shut up, Gobta, that's
supposed to be a secret!

00:12:14.167 --> 00:12:15.375 align:middle
How is it a secret
when everybody

00:12:15.458 --> 00:12:16.792 align:middle
already knows about it?

00:12:16.875 --> 00:12:18.333 align:middle
[GOBZO]
E-Everybody...?

00:12:18.417 --> 00:12:20.417 align:middle
Oh, yeah, pretty much all
of Tempest knows

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.500 align:middle
you've got a thing for Shion.

00:12:21.583 --> 00:12:22.875 align:middle
[GOBZO]
I was gonna follow you forever,

00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.667 align:middle
but now I take it back,
you loudmouth!

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:30.958 align:middle
[CROWD laughing]

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:33.625 align:middle
[KIRARA growls]
Stop laughing, you idiots!

00:12:33.708 --> 00:12:36.125 align:middle
I'll teach you
to underestimate me!

00:12:36.208 --> 00:12:37.917 align:middle
Why don't you all just...

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.042 align:middle
[BOTH]
Hmm?

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:42.000 align:middle
...curl up and die!

00:12:45.792 --> 00:12:48.958 align:middle
[gasping]

00:12:49.042 --> 00:12:50.167 align:middle
Hoo boy.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.917 align:middle
Classic Kirara.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.792 align:middle
Show time.

00:12:54.875 --> 00:12:56.875 align:middle
[gasping]

00:12:58.625 --> 00:13:03.917 align:middle
[CROWD laughing]

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.583 align:middle
What the hell, why aren't
any of them dying?

00:13:06.667 --> 00:13:08.083 align:middle
That's how it is.

00:13:08.167 --> 00:13:09.542 align:middle
[KIRARA]
Huh?

00:13:09.625 --> 00:13:11.167 align:middle
[SHUNA] You have a skill
that converts your voice into

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.292 align:middle
a stream of force,
which then interferes with

00:13:13.375 --> 00:13:15.750 align:middle
your target's brain waves.

00:13:18.625 --> 00:13:22.042 align:middle
It's a truly dreadful ability,
so I'm sure you'll understand

00:13:22.125 --> 00:13:24.875 align:middle
its use is forbidden
in this land.

00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.417 align:middle
[KIRARA]
Impossible.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.958 align:middle
This girl somehow managed to
cancel out my Bewilder power!

00:13:32.833 --> 00:13:35.167 align:middle
[gasps]

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.708 align:middle
[SHUNA] Unfortunately,
you're not a suitable fit

00:13:37.792 --> 00:13:41.542 align:middle
for our nation. I'd like
your group to take its leave.

00:13:41.625 --> 00:13:44.708 align:middle
What...? Are you serious...?

00:13:44.792 --> 00:13:47.375 align:middle
[KIRARA]
She's a real beast.

00:13:47.458 --> 00:13:50.500 align:middle
[SHOGO] Oh, really?
So that's how it's gonna be?

00:13:50.583 --> 00:13:52.875 align:middle
Whatever.
If that's what you want,

00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.583 align:middle
then I'll be happy
to take you on for real.

00:13:58.125 --> 00:14:00.000 align:middle
[SHOGO]
I'll make this girl my slave.

00:14:00.083 --> 00:14:02.750 align:middle
I'll torture her until
she begs me for forgiveness.

00:14:02.833 --> 00:14:04.833 align:middle
--[slurps]
--[SHION] Disgusting.

00:14:04.917 --> 00:14:09.042 align:middle
Your filthy thoughts are
written all over your face.

00:14:09.125 --> 00:14:12.375 align:middle
If you quietly leave our city
right now, I'll overlook this.

00:14:12.458 --> 00:14:13.833 align:middle
If you refuse...

00:14:13.917 --> 00:14:16.000 align:middle
...then you leave me
with no choice.

00:14:17.208 --> 00:14:18.625 align:middle
That sounds like fun!

00:14:18.708 --> 00:14:20.917 align:middle
I'm gonna mop the floor
with you, sweetheart!

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.125 align:middle
[gasping]

00:14:24.208 --> 00:14:26.125 align:middle
So be it. If nothing else,

00:14:26.208 --> 00:14:29.250 align:middle
perhaps a good beating will
knock some sense into you.

00:14:30.708 --> 00:14:34.708 align:middle
Let's do this.
I haven't got all day.

00:14:34.792 --> 00:14:36.417 align:middle
[whistles]

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.875 align:middle
Huh. In that case...

00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.750 align:middle
...guess I'll join
the party, too.

00:14:42.333 --> 00:14:44.500 align:middle
Seems this is the perfect
opportunity to test out

00:14:44.583 --> 00:14:46.958 align:middle
my various abilities.

00:14:47.042 --> 00:14:50.000 align:middle
[chuckles] And now that
there's no oversight,

00:14:50.083 --> 00:14:53.750 align:middle
I can finally use my Severer
skill without any limitations.

00:14:55.542 --> 00:14:57.042 align:middle
This could be bad.

00:14:57.125 --> 00:14:59.833 align:middle
Listen carefully, Gobzo, I want
you to keep Princess Shuna safe.

00:14:59.917 --> 00:15:02.500 align:middle
Right! I'm on it, sir!

00:15:02.583 --> 00:15:04.000 align:middle
[KYOYA]
Huh.

00:15:05.917 --> 00:15:09.125 align:middle
[laughs maniacally] With my
power, not even that crone

00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:11.583 align:middle
Hinata could take me on and win.

00:15:11.667 --> 00:15:14.458 align:middle
I doubt a wimp like you
will fair any better!

00:15:16.083 --> 00:15:18.667 align:middle
[SHOGO bellows]

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.125 align:middle
[MYULAN]
Great magic?

00:15:20.208 --> 00:15:21.542 align:middle
[CLAYMAN]
Yes. You will turn

00:15:21.625 --> 00:15:25.042 align:middle
the Capital city into
an anti-magic area.

00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:27.208 align:middle
Our aim is to cut off
their communications with

00:15:27.292 --> 00:15:30.750 align:middle
the outside world.
You are to get started at once.

00:15:30.833 --> 00:15:33.208 align:middle
This will be your final job.

00:15:33.292 --> 00:15:36.333 align:middle
Hmph. Things are
getting rather interesting!

00:15:36.417 --> 00:15:38.583 align:middle
A grand war is going
to break out!

00:15:38.667 --> 00:15:40.083 align:middle
Though unexpected
events have led to

00:15:40.167 --> 00:15:42.125 align:middle
some surprising developments.

00:15:42.208 --> 00:15:44.333 align:middle
The game continues.

00:15:44.417 --> 00:15:45.708 align:middle
[GRUCIUS]
Where are you going?

00:15:45.792 --> 00:15:48.625 align:middle
[MYULAN gasps]

00:15:48.708 --> 00:15:50.042 align:middle
Do you need something?

00:15:50.125 --> 00:15:51.625 align:middle
A Crimuru puff.

00:15:51.708 --> 00:15:54.083 align:middle
Sorry, I don't follow.

00:15:54.167 --> 00:15:55.792 align:middle
[GRUCIUS] It's a new pastry
they're making.

00:15:55.875 --> 00:15:57.625 align:middle
They're serving some
in the dining hall.

00:15:57.708 --> 00:16:00.167 align:middle
I heard they're pretty good,
if you wanna go with me.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:01.708 align:middle
[MYULAN]
I appreciate the offer,

00:16:01.792 --> 00:16:03.750 align:middle
but I just received
one yesterday.

00:16:03.833 --> 00:16:05.333 align:middle
[GRUCIUS]
Was it from Youm?

00:16:05.417 --> 00:16:06.667 align:middle
Uh. Yes?

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:10.875 align:middle
Ugh. Sneaky rat.
Always one step ahead.

00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:14.167 align:middle
Sorry, I have things to do--
I'll see you later, though!

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:15.917 align:middle
Wait.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000 align:middle
Can I really see you later?

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.458 align:middle
I just got a message,
and honestly,

00:16:22.542 --> 00:16:25.250 align:middle
it didn't sit well with me.

00:16:25.333 --> 00:16:28.167 align:middle
Demon Lord Milim has declared
war on the Beast Kingdom.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.875 align:middle
And all I could think was
that it seemed ridiculous.

00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:34.000 align:middle
But then I realized you've been
acting kinda weird lately,

00:16:34.083 --> 00:16:37.208 align:middle
so I couldn't help
but wonder about you.

00:16:37.292 --> 00:16:39.583 align:middle
[MYULAN] This is why Clayman
was in such a hurry.

00:16:39.667 --> 00:16:41.917 align:middle
I guess he wasn't expecting
the Demon Lord Milim

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.333 align:middle
to act on her own.

00:16:43.417 --> 00:16:45.125 align:middle
I'm sorry, I need to go!

00:16:45.208 --> 00:16:46.958 align:middle
Myulan!

00:16:47.042 --> 00:16:49.250 align:middle
[MYULAN] I don't understand,
what is the purpose of

00:16:49.333 --> 00:16:52.042 align:middle
cutting off this country's
communications?

00:16:52.125 --> 00:16:54.417 align:middle
Of course. Rimuru Tempest.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.042 align:middle
He's afraid that slime
will hear about it

00:16:56.125 --> 00:16:58.167 align:middle
and try to intervene somehow.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.542 align:middle
Stop, Myulan!

00:16:59.625 --> 00:17:01.375 align:middle
[MYULAN] I have to activate
the magic he ordered me

00:17:01.458 --> 00:17:03.042 align:middle
to use immediately!

00:17:03.125 --> 00:17:05.875 align:middle
Otherwise, Clayman is
likely to fly into a rage--

00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.542 align:middle
a tantrum that will
kill not only me,

00:17:07.625 --> 00:17:09.458 align:middle
but everyone in this city!

00:17:09.542 --> 00:17:10.833 align:middle
[GRUCIUS]
Hey!

00:17:10.917 --> 00:17:13.083 align:middle
If the Demon Lord Milim
has truly declared war,

00:17:13.167 --> 00:17:15.125 align:middle
then isn't your
master in danger?

00:17:15.208 --> 00:17:19.500 align:middle
Huh? You say that as though you
are familiar with her power.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.792 align:middle
[GRUCIUS] Don't worry.
Lord Carrion is invincible.

00:17:24.875 --> 00:17:27.083 align:middle
It's inconceivable
that he could lose.

00:17:27.167 --> 00:17:30.333 align:middle
The only person I'm concerned
about right now is you!

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.833 align:middle
I know you're a majin, Myulan.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.792 align:middle
[sighs] You've always
been sharp when it comes

00:17:39.875 --> 00:17:41.667 align:middle
to things like this.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:42.792 align:middle
So, then--

00:17:42.875 --> 00:17:45.542 align:middle
[MYULAN]
I don't have a choice, Grucius.

00:17:45.625 --> 00:17:48.167 align:middle
I want you to know
that I care about you.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.542 align:middle
I consider you a dear friend.

00:17:50.625 --> 00:17:52.000 align:middle
[GRUCIUS sighs]

00:17:52.083 --> 00:17:55.292 align:middle
[MYULAN] With that said,
if you insist on interfering...

00:17:55.375 --> 00:17:57.375 align:middle
[GRUCIUS grunts]

00:18:00.583 --> 00:18:02.708 align:middle
[MYULAN]
...I will have to kill you.

00:18:04.708 --> 00:18:07.708 align:middle
[GRUCIUS] Your face...
That determination.

00:18:07.792 --> 00:18:09.625 align:middle
You're actually prepared to die.

00:18:09.708 --> 00:18:11.833 align:middle
Why, though? Tell me!

00:18:13.375 --> 00:18:15.542 align:middle
[GRUCIUS] Are you following
an order from your master?

00:18:15.625 --> 00:18:18.333 align:middle
You are! You have to be!

00:18:18.417 --> 00:18:19.583 align:middle
Say something!

00:18:19.667 --> 00:18:21.750 align:middle
[MYULAN whimpers]

00:18:21.833 --> 00:18:24.167 align:middle
The Demon Lord Clayman
is infamous for using people

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.208 align:middle
and then discarding
them like garbage.

00:18:26.292 --> 00:18:28.208 align:middle
--Is it him?
--Enough, Grucius!

00:18:28.292 --> 00:18:29.375 align:middle
You don't know anything!

00:18:29.458 --> 00:18:31.167 align:middle
It's all because of him, right?

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:32.500 align:middle
You're prepared
to die fulfilling

00:18:32.583 --> 00:18:33.917 align:middle
that lowlife's orders.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:34.917 align:middle
[YOUM]
Is that so?

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.250 align:middle
[gasps]

00:18:36.333 --> 00:18:38.875 align:middle
[YOUM]
How interesting.

00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:40.417 align:middle
[MYULAN]
Youm...

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.875 align:middle
Myulan, if something's
going on, you can tell me.

00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:45.417 align:middle
I'll protect you.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.708 align:middle
Are you crazy?

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:48.375 align:middle
Can you not see what's
standing in front of you?

00:18:48.458 --> 00:18:50.417 align:middle
I'm a majin for crying out loud!

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.458 align:middle
Okay, and why does that matter?

00:18:52.542 --> 00:18:54.500 align:middle
A person's race and
species doesn't determine

00:18:54.583 --> 00:18:57.458 align:middle
their overall character
or worth in this world.

00:18:57.542 --> 00:19:00.500 align:middle
I realized that when I met
the slime that runs this place.

00:19:00.583 --> 00:19:02.125 align:middle
Talk about a major life lesson.

00:19:02.208 --> 00:19:04.667 align:middle
[gasps]

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:07.458 align:middle
I love you, Myulan. Truly.

00:19:07.542 --> 00:19:09.667 align:middle
[gasps]

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.458 align:middle
Isn't it natural to want
to protect the people

00:19:11.542 --> 00:19:13.333 align:middle
that you cherish in life?

00:19:14.542 --> 00:19:16.750 align:middle
[MYULAN whimpers]
You're a fool!

00:19:16.833 --> 00:19:19.125 align:middle
The Myulan you've known all
this time was just a pretense

00:19:19.208 --> 00:19:20.875 align:middle
to deceive you!

00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:24.417 align:middle
The person that you think you
love doesn't even really exist!

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.208 align:middle
Listen carefully.

00:19:33.583 --> 00:19:36.458 align:middle
[YOUM] I'll let you fool me
until the day I die.

00:19:38.917 --> 00:19:41.458 align:middle
[YOUM] As long as I believe
it until the very end,

00:19:41.542 --> 00:19:43.583 align:middle
it's no different
from the truth.

00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:48.333 align:middle
[MYULAN]
Let me go.

00:19:48.417 --> 00:19:49.917 align:middle
Oh. Sorry.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.333 align:middle
You just took advantage of the
moment to hug her, you creep!

00:19:52.417 --> 00:19:55.042 align:middle
Yep, guilty. I honestly thought
I could get away with it.

00:19:55.125 --> 00:19:56.625 align:middle
Well, I say you can't!

00:19:56.708 --> 00:19:58.792 align:middle
Why are you so invested
in what I do?

00:19:58.875 --> 00:20:00.708 align:middle
[GRUCIUS] Because you're always
beating me to the punch!

00:20:00.792 --> 00:20:01.917 align:middle
[YOUM]
Weren't you the one that said...

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.500 align:middle
Thank you, Youm. I'm ready.

00:20:06.833 --> 00:20:08.708 align:middle
[GRUCIUS, YOUM grunting]

00:20:29.875 --> 00:20:31.958 align:middle
Stop it, Myulan!

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:44.667 align:middle
Don't do it!

00:20:52.542 --> 00:20:56.000 align:middle
[MYULAN] I'm sorry,
but if it will keep you safe...

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.458 align:middle
[MYULAN]
...I have no choice.

00:21:15.875 --> 00:21:17.833 align:middle
Activate Prison Field!

00:21:28.875 --> 00:21:31.000 align:middle
[gasps]
There are two barriers?

00:21:31.083 --> 00:21:32.958 align:middle
But why?

00:21:33.042 --> 00:21:34.500 align:middle
[gasps]

00:21:34.583 --> 00:21:36.250 align:middle
What's the matter, Benimaru?

00:21:36.333 --> 00:21:38.542 align:middle
I can't connect
with Lord Rimuru.

00:21:38.625 --> 00:21:40.292 align:middle
There is something interfering.

00:21:40.375 --> 00:21:42.083 align:middle
[RIGURD gasps]

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:44.000 align:middle
Lord Rimuru...

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.625 align:middle
[SHION grunts]

00:21:47.708 --> 00:21:49.167 align:middle
How disappointing.

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.292 align:middle
You talked such a big game
I hoped you might actually

00:21:51.375 --> 00:21:52.833 align:middle
be a challenge.

00:21:52.917 --> 00:21:56.042 align:middle
[SHOGO growls] Damn,
your kicking game is no joke.

00:21:59.583 --> 00:22:01.292 align:middle
[SHION gasps]

00:22:01.375 --> 00:22:02.917 align:middle
What is this...?

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.625 align:middle
My strength is
leaving my body...

00:22:05.708 --> 00:22:08.042 align:middle
--[SHOGO laughs]
--[gasps]

00:22:08.125 --> 00:22:12.625 align:middle
Tch. You doing okay
over there, lady?

00:22:12.708 --> 00:22:15.500 align:middle
You seem to be
having some difficulty.

00:23:54.208 --> 00:23:57.125 align:middle
