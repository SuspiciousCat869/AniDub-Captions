00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:22.731 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
That's check, Lord Veldora.

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:25.734 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Hmm. I see
you've improved, Ifrit.

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:27.027 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Thank you, sir.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.695 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
That's the way, Ifrit.

00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:32.615 position:50% align:center
You must rise to my level
as fast as you can!

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.119 position:50% align:center
I'll be counting down
the days until you do!

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.662 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Oh, right!

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:41.458 position:50% align:center
To be fair, I did
win this game, though.

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:44.919 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Yes. But I fear
we don't have much time.

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:47.047 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
What do you mean?

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.590 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
I'm saying it's possible

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:51.134 position:50% align:center
I won't be here much longer.

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.386 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT gasps]
Are you serious?

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.638 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
These have been good times.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.932 position:50% align:center
So much has happened.

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:31.443 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] At long last,
Rimuru has finally fulfilled

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:35.321 position:50% align:center
his promise to Shizu to
save her students in Ingrassia.

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.991 position:50% align:center
He can now return to Tempest.

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:39.492 position:50% align:center
That mask...

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:41.077 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
What about it?

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:45.040 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] I believe the one who
sealed me away was wearing that.

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:46.833 position:50% align:center
Or maybe it just looks similar.

00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:50.879 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] It was handed down
from the Hero to Shizu,

00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:55.550 position:50% align:center
and then to Chloe from Rimuru.
Could there be some connection?

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:57.969 position:50% align:center
Of course not!
I'm overthinking this!

00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:00.889 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] Back then, we truly
believed that more fun times

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:03.141 position:50% align:center
were waiting for Lord Rimuru
once he returned

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:05.060 position:50% align:center
to the nation of monsters.

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:07.145 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] I had the same
carefree thoughts.

00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:08.980 position:50% align:center
But this is when
Shizu's disciple,

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:11.524 position:50% align:center
Hinata Sakaguchi, appears.

00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:20.784 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] Because of Hinata's
wide-range barrier,

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:23.578 position:50% align:center
all magicules within have
been purged and Lord Rimuru

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:25.789 position:50% align:center
can't make full use
of his strength.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:28.541 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Nothing he says seems
to get through to this woman!

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.294 position:50% align:center
She's definitely
a stubborn opponent.

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.254 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] I can't believe
how much Lord Rimuru's

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
struggling with this fight.

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.300 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Yes, he might lose this time.

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:39.678 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] Are you sure?!
Can he pull through?

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:42.430 position:50% align:center
If Lord Rimuru dies,
what happens to us?

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:45.558 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA laughs]
Don't panic, Ifrit!

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:49.354 position:50% align:center
All we need to do is keep an eye
on Rimuru and have faith in him.

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:52.232 position:50% align:center
I'm certain he has an idea.

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:54.317 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
Put an end to this.

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.236 position:50% align:center
Disintegration!

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:08.164 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
That's my Rimuru!

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.959 position:50% align:center
He had a body double ready
well in advance.

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.169 position:50% align:center
Then, he hid his real body
while the doppelganger

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:15.296 position:50% align:center
did all the dangerous fighting.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.133 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
My! He really is quite clever.

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:21.469 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Indeed, though it was
a bit of a risky gamble.

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:25.390 position:50% align:center
Even I am impressed!
At least he can finally go home.

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:29.102 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] Actually...
Something seems to be amiss.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.691 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Wh-What's this?
Tempest has changed.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.320 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Humans consumed
by greed are invading

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:40.989 position:50% align:center
the nation of monsters.

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:43.450 position:50% align:center
What a troublesome race
these creatures are.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:46.202 position:50% align:center
Regardless, Rimuru still
insists on trying to live

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:47.787 position:50% align:center
side by side with them.

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:52.375 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] Yes. He must be trying
to abide by human rules himself.

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:54.336 position:50% align:center
Look at how calm he appears.

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.920 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
But on the inside,

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:58.673 position:50% align:center
his emotions are
raging like a storm.

00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:02.427 position:50% align:center
They may burst forth
at any moment now.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.514 position:50% align:center
I hope nothing else happens
to cause his soul more pain.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.770 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
There are no words...

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:13.229 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Truly...

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.982 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] I only had contact
with Shion through Rimuru.

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:18.735 position:50% align:center
But I still felt his
attachment to the Kijin.

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:20.987 position:50% align:center
He always respected her and
felt that she was someone

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:25.033 position:50% align:center
he could learn a lot from.
But now she's...

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:30.580 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] I can't bear to see
Rimuru hurt so severely.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.833 position:50% align:center
But even if the monsters die,
there's no reason to be sad.

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:37.128 position:50% align:center
Their souls will simply return
to the cycle of life and death,

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:40.256 position:50% align:center
and they will devote themselves
to reaching greater heights.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.550 position:50% align:center
That is how
nature works, correct?

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:44.969 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Yes. I believe so.

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:47.764 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Then why doesn't
he simply state that himself?

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:50.517 position:50% align:center
Why is Rimuru
grieving so deeply?

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.103 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] Do you not
feel sad, Lord Veldora?

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:56.398 position:50% align:center
Shion was a cheerful, innocent
lady from whom we could all

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:59.234 position:50% align:center
learn so much,
and yet, senseless violence

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:01.736 position:50% align:center
--has taken her away from us.
--[VELDORA gasps]

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.030 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] The depth of one's
sadness toward a loss

00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:07.075 position:50% align:center
is proportionate to
the depth of the relationship.

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:10.120 position:50% align:center
I finally realized that
myself just recently.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:13.915 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] I see... It's possible
that by explaining Shion's death

00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:17.293 position:50% align:center
as nature's way, I was
trying to avert my own eyes

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.546 position:50% align:center
from the grief I feel.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:22.173 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] Long ago,
when Shizu when was young,

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:26.177 position:50% align:center
I killed one of her friends.
A girl named Pirino.

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:29.014 position:50% align:center
At the time, my sense
of self was still faint.

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:31.641 position:50% align:center
And I was a creature that
only reacted in response

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:34.060 position:50% align:center
with hostility, but still,

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:36.229 position:50% align:center
it was an awful sin
that I committed.

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:39.482 position:50% align:center
I have no doubt that was
the main reason Shizu and I

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:41.818 position:50% align:center
were never able to
connect mentally.

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.028 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Ifrit...

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:46.740 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT chuckles]
Yet, I have changed.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:49.909 position:50% align:center
Is it because I thought of death
as nature's way back then

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:52.912 position:50% align:center
and utterly failed to
see Shizu's sadness?

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:55.874 position:50% align:center
Shizu considered
my sin to be her own,

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:58.710 position:50% align:center
and her need to atone
for it broke her heart.

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:01.796 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] If I were not here
observing Lord Rimuru with you,

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.383 position:50% align:center
then I might have never come
to that realization on my own.

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:06.968 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Yes.

00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:11.222 position:50% align:center
Something as serious as death
should never be taken lightly.

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:14.392 position:50% align:center
[EREN] Wait, listen to me!
The odds are pretty slim.

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:16.895 position:50% align:center
In fact, they might
be basically zero.

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:18.730 position:50% align:center
But I know a fairy tale
specifically about

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:21.232 position:50% align:center
bringing the dead back to life!

00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:22.567 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Lord Veldora!

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.778 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] The dead can be
brought back to life?

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:28.031 position:50% align:center
It would be miraculous
if such a thing were true.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:31.326 position:50% align:center
[EREN] It's the tale of
a girl and her pet dragon.

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:34.037 position:50% align:center
The girl was the daughter
of a human and a dragon,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.498 position:50% align:center
and she was raised as
the Dragon Princess.

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:38.541 position:50% align:center
One day, her father, a dragon,

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:41.294 position:50% align:center
made a double of himself
in the form of a baby.

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:43.296 position:50% align:center
So the girl would have a friend.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.756 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
I know this tale.

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:47.133 position:50% align:center
Isn't this
"The Dragon Princess"?

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:49.761 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Indeed. It's about Milim.

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:52.347 position:50% align:center
Though I don't know
the details very well.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.224 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Wait...
So you're saying the barrier

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:56.893 position:50% align:center
could be keeping their
souls from escaping?

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:59.938 position:50% align:center
[GREAT SAGE]
The probability of it is 3.14%.

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:03.566 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] The chance they
can be revived is 3.14%.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.527 position:50% align:center
That's plenty! Behold!

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.571 position:50% align:center
Rimuru has reached
the same conclusion as me.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:11.282 position:50% align:center
His fighting spirit
has been reignited!

00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:14.285 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] And... it appears
he has steeled his resolve.

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:18.456 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Yes. The resolve to
take the lives of 10,000 humans.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.750 position:50% align:center
By bearing that sin,
he will ultimately become

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:22.877 position:50% align:center
a new Demon Lord.

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:23.962 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Hmm.

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:26.715 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Rimuru. You can rest easy.

00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:28.633 position:50% align:center
You are not in this alone.

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:32.053 position:50% align:center
I, Veldora, will bear that
sin along with you!

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:37.726 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] These are the guys who
killed Shion and the rest.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:38.977 position:50% align:center
Okay...

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:41.813 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Let's do this.

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:45.191 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
The counterattack has begun.

00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:47.027 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Yes, the air trembles,

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.779 position:50% align:center
as if in response
to Rimuru's anger.

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:52.991 position:50% align:center
The rage his friends feel
is also intense.

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
They are normally such
peaceful creatures,

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.830 position:50% align:center
but now, their eyes
have taken on a new color.

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:02.125 position:50% align:center
Still, before the battle, Rimuru
spoke with Benimaru about

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.210 position:50% align:center
what to do should
he lose control of himself

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:07.589 position:50% align:center
after his evolution. He asked
him to take whoever was left

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:11.051 position:50% align:center
who could still fight
and eliminate him.

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:13.386 position:50% align:center
Such a cruel request to make.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.263 position:50% align:center
I could never agree to that.

00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:18.308 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] Indeed. Perhaps
I could have in the past.

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.477 position:50% align:center
But it'd be hard
for me nowadays.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.147 position:50% align:center
Of course, I could also never
command an army of monsters.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.317 position:50% align:center
Much less stop someone
as powerful as Lord Rimuru.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.735 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
That is also true.

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:31.446 position:50% align:center
But Rimuru does not make
impossible requests.

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:34.574 position:50% align:center
It must mean he truly
trusts Benimaru.

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:37.494 position:50% align:center
I may even be
a bit jealous of him.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.747 position:50% align:center
Then again, Rimuru would never
do anything to make his friends

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.833 position:50% align:center
sad or put them out.
As such, I'm sure he will

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:46.544 position:50% align:center
successfully awaken
as a Demon Lord.

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.963 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] You're right.
We must have faith!

00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:51.966 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Lord Veldora. Look there!

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:56.262 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Die. May the wrath
of the gods pierce you.

00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:57.722 position:50% align:center
Megiddo!

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:01.976 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
The kind, gentle Rimuru...

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.146 position:50% align:center
The Rimuru who so deeply
hated to hurt anyone.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.107 position:50% align:center
He's killing these
enemy soldiers without

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.693 position:50% align:center
the slightest reluctance.

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:11.903 position:50% align:center
He's chosen the optimal
method for killing them

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:15.865 position:50% align:center
and is proceeding to carry
it out with no hesitation.

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:18.993 position:50% align:center
To be honest with you, I can't
help but shudder at his resolve.

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:21.579 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Same.

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:23.164 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] It certainly
doesn't pay to anger those

00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:25.250 position:50% align:center
who are normally mild-mannered.

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:28.545 position:50% align:center
The sacred text contains
many verses to that effect.

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:31.631 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] He isn't killing
King Edmaris of Falmuth?

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:33.800 position:50% align:center
It's surprising how calm he is.

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:35.260 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Right?

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:37.887 position:50% align:center
If it were me, I wouldn't
concern myself with talking.

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:40.140 position:50% align:center
I would simply kill
all of them on the spot.

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:42.058 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Oh, but if you think about it,

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:44.144 position:50% align:center
doing such a thing would
create much more of a mess

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:45.729 position:50% align:center
to clean up later.

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:48.857 position:50% align:center
If the ruler of the Kingdom of
Falmuth were to be assassinated,

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.608 position:50% align:center
his entire army
would be mobilized

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:52.485 position:50% align:center
to defend the land's honor.

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:55.697 position:50% align:center
The Western Holy Church wouldn't
take it lying down, either.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.907 position:50% align:center
If anything,
by exercising restraint,

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:00.618 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru is ensuring
that the war doesn't drag out

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:02.287 position:50% align:center
longer than necessary.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.165 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Hmm. A wise observation.

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:07.417 position:50% align:center
Still, even if he
doesn't kill him,

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.586 position:50% align:center
I doubt he'll show
the king mercy.

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:13.423 position:50% align:center
Personally, I would
have devoured him.

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.925 position:50% align:center
Rimuru's patience
is quite impressive.

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:18.678 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
His force of will is remarkable.

00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:21.556 position:50% align:center
But was that really
the right choice?

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:26.936 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Has the evolution begun?

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.855 position:50% align:center
Rimuru is acting strange.

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:31.149 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
He seems to be swaying a bit.

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:33.318 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Yes. I don't
know since I haven't

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:34.944 position:50% align:center
experienced it myself,

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:38.740 position:50% align:center
but I imagine it's not easy
evolving into a Demon Lord.

00:11:42.077 --> 00:11:45.288 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Hmm? Oh my.
That's an Archdemon.

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:47.374 position:50% align:center
--[IFRIT] What?!
--[VELDORA] No doubt about it.

00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:50.043 position:50% align:center
What's more,
he's no newborn chick.

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:53.755 position:50% align:center
He's a dangerous one who's
been alive for a very long time.

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:55.131 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Seriously?

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:57.884 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Ifrit, even though
you're a superior spirit

00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:00.178 position:50% align:center
who ranks higher
than demons, you can't see

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:02.222 position:50% align:center
how powerful he is, can you?

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:05.475 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] No. In my eyes,
he appears to be no more

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.227 position:50% align:center
than a Greater Demon.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.854 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Exactly, which
should prove just how perfect

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:12.524 position:50% align:center
this Archdemon's
disguise really is.

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:14.901 position:50% align:center
On top of that,
he appeared to Rimuru

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:17.112 position:50% align:center
without even being summoned.

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:20.949 position:50% align:center
Could it be possible that
he's lived even longer than me?

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:23.368 position:50% align:center
No, surely not...

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.835 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA yawns]
I'm so bored.

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:33.336 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT gasps]
Bored?!

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.672 position:50% align:center
Lord Veldora, this is
an unprecedented moment

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.424 position:50% align:center
of incredible tension!

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:39.259 position:50% align:center
Isn't there something
else you can say?!

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:41.261 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Well, I'm only being honest!

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
Since Rimuru has fallen
into the sleep of evolution,

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:46.683 position:50% align:center
we can't see what's happening
in the outside world!

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:49.644 position:50% align:center
I'm so bored,
I don't know what to do!

00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:52.355 position:50% align:center
But I suppose playing
around won't do any good.

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:54.024 position:50% align:center
I'm sure Rimuru
is going to be busy

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:56.109 position:50% align:center
after he becomes a Demon Lord.

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:58.319 position:50% align:center
I need to break free of
Unlimited Imprisonment

00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:01.322 position:50% align:center
as quickly as possible
so I can assist him!

00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:04.075 position:50% align:center
I'll keep analyzing
Unlimited Imprisonment!

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:05.702 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Good luck, sir!

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:09.998 position:50% align:center
--[VELDORA] Hmm?
--[IFRIT] What's the matter?

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:11.416 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
This is strange...

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:12.834 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Lord Veldora?

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:15.253 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] The analysis is
moving at breakneck speed.

00:13:15.337 --> 00:13:17.881 position:50% align:center
In fact, I feel power
welling up within me!

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:19.674 position:50% align:center
It's several times faster.

00:13:19.758 --> 00:13:22.177 position:50% align:center
Dozens? Maybe a hundred times?

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.347 position:50% align:center
No... The analysis is
moving many hundreds of times

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.183 position:50% align:center
faster than before! I'm amazing!

00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:30.185 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] I knew you could
do it, Lord Veldora!

00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:31.644 position:50% align:center
When you put your mind to it,

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.521 position:50% align:center
Unlimited Imprisonment
is a simple--

00:13:33.605 --> 00:13:34.898 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Oh, no, no, no, no!

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:37.609 position:50% align:center
Even I won't allow myself
to become that arrogant.

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:39.527 position:50% align:center
It must be something else.

00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:42.030 position:50% align:center
My power wouldn't grow
this much for no reason.

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:45.325 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] I see, and just exactly
how much has it increased?

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:46.993 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Well, it's still growing,

00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:49.913 position:50% align:center
but I'd say about 345 times.

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:51.081 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
What?!

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:52.791 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Yes, I expected that response.

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:54.292 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
No, that can't be right!

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:56.795 position:50% align:center
It should be obvious
that something is wrong!

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:59.130 position:50% align:center
Um, did you eat something
you shouldn't have?

00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:01.508 position:50% align:center
I bet you ate something you
found on the ground again!

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:02.801 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Don't be ridiculous!

00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:06.096 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT grunts] I'm sorry.
I lost my composure.

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:10.392 position:50% align:center
By the way, Lord Veldora, how is
it that you can remain so calm?

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:12.477 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] All things
considered, it's easy.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.729 position:50% align:center
If I continue to analyze
Unlimited Imprisonment

00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:16.981 position:50% align:center
at this pace, then I'll
be free in no time!

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:19.275 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:21.945 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] Well, yes,
I suppose that's true.

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:24.739 position:50% align:center
So do you have any idea
why this is happening?

00:14:24.823 --> 00:14:26.282 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Excellent question.

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:30.286 position:50% align:center
Rimuru's own analysis speed
also seems to be much higher.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.665 position:50% align:center
Most likely, in the process of
becoming a true Demon Lord,

00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:35.959 position:50% align:center
the calculation
ability of Rimuru's skills

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:37.919 position:50% align:center
must have substantially
increased.

00:14:38.003 --> 00:14:39.629 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Of course, that makes sense.

00:14:39.713 --> 00:14:42.382 position:50% align:center
So your skills have
improved along with his.

00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:44.718 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,
I'm relieved.

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:46.469 position:50% align:center
--[VELDORA] Hmm?
--[IFRIT] I thought your life...

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:48.388 position:50% align:center
--[VELDORA] My life?!
--[IFRIT] ...was possibly

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:50.598 position:50% align:center
emitting its last
flickers of light...

00:14:50.682 --> 00:14:52.851 position:50% align:center
I was worried it was
the end for you.

00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:53.977 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Don't be silly!

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.105 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
There's no way!

00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:59.315 position:50% align:center
Don't say scary
things like that.

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:04.070 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Oh! Lord Veldora, look at that!

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:07.240 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
It seems Rimuru's evolution

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:10.535 position:50% align:center
into a Demon Lord is complete.

00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:11.745 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
What's happening?

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:13.204 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
It's the gift.

00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:15.331 position:50% align:center
When one evolves
into a Demon Lord,

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:18.043 position:50% align:center
gifts are then bestowed upon
all the monsters who share

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:20.420 position:50% align:center
a connection with
the newly awakened being.

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:22.088 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
I see...

00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:28.428 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Wait, Lord Veldora!

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:30.680 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Huh? Why is this happening?

00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:33.350 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] Lord Veldora, could it
be that the one we thought to be

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:36.269 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru all this
time is actually...

00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:37.520 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
I already knew that.

00:15:37.604 --> 00:15:38.980 position:50% align:center
--[IFRIT gasps]
--[VELDORA] I could tell from

00:15:39.064 --> 00:15:41.483 position:50% align:center
the start that Rimuru's
skills were special.

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:43.485 position:50% align:center
Indeed, they were stand-alone!

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:45.528 position:50% align:center
I've always known
he had a proxy!

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:48.281 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
You are brilliant, Lord Veldora!

00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:50.450 position:50% align:center
Hold on,
there's no way you knew!

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:52.577 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, you'd have
that overly smug look

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.329 position:50% align:center
on your face like usual!

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:57.415 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Ifrit! Shion
and the others are awake!

00:15:57.499 --> 00:15:58.917 position:50% align:center
But...

00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:07.717 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Oh, Lord Raphael!

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.430 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] My instincts are
telling me that I must not defy

00:16:12.514 --> 00:16:15.350 position:50% align:center
this particular being.

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:17.727 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Hello, what
brings you here today?

00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:19.396 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Whatever you command, I, Ifrit,

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:21.272 position:50% align:center
am more than willing to obey!

00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:22.774 position:50% align:center
Can we help you?

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:25.652 position:50% align:center
Yes. This individual of
the Ifrit race has no name

00:16:25.735 --> 00:16:27.404 position:50% align:center
and a meager ego.

00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:29.489 position:50% align:center
For this reason,
you lack the essential basis

00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:33.410 position:50% align:center
to acquire skills. I recommend
you resume your training.

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:34.953 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Right! As you wish.

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:38.123 position:50% align:center
I, Ifrit, shall
become a training beast!

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:40.834 position:50% align:center
Hup! One! Two! Three! Four!

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:42.335 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
So, um...

00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:44.462 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Notice. I am now
convinced that the individual,

00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:46.214 position:50% align:center
Veldora, has been
slacking off.

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:47.757 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA gasps]

00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:49.592 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Now then,
I command you to acquire

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:51.594 position:50% align:center
an ultimate skill immediately.

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:53.763 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Um, that's a tall order...

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:55.557 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Notice. It is possible.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.810 position:50% align:center
I have forced your calculation
domain to expand exponentially.

00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:01.312 position:50% align:center
Therefore, you can use your
own strength to maintain it

00:17:01.396 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
and perform the analytical
work on Unlimited Imprisonment.

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:06.317 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Raphael
definitely isn't posing this

00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:07.694 position:50% align:center
as an optional request.

00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:10.113 position:50% align:center
If anything,
it's an outright demand.

00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:15.702 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
I have to do it, don't I?

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:17.370 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Yes!

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:20.248 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Great news!

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:22.375 position:50% align:center
Through my efforts,
I have acquired it!

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:24.919 position:50% align:center
The ultimate skill, Faust!

00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:27.672 position:50% align:center
Is this because of
the gift from Rimuru?

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:29.132 position:50% align:center
I must thank him!

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:31.926 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] Now Lord Raphael
won't be angry with you.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.303 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Yes!

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:36.598 position:50% align:center
Goodness, Ifrit, you look
a lot more muscular now.

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:39.559 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] I do?
I still have a long way to go!

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:42.020 position:50% align:center
I will continue to train
until my overall body fat

00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:43.855 position:50% align:center
is less than 10%!

00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:46.191 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Noted. Well, good luck.

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:50.528 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Question. Have you
acquired an ultimate skill?

00:17:50.612 --> 00:17:52.572 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Ah! Y-Yes, of course!

00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:53.865 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Good.

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:55.825 position:50% align:center
Then let us break through
Unlimited Imprisonment

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:56.826 position:50% align:center
right away.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.287 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Oh! You get to go outside!

00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:01.414 position:50% align:center
Congratulations, Lord Veldora!

00:18:01.498 --> 00:18:03.291 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Let's not get
ahead of ourselves!

00:18:03.375 --> 00:18:04.959 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:07.921 position:50% align:center
What should I say to
Rimuru once I've revived?

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:10.131 position:50% align:center
Naturally, I'll start
with boasting.

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:13.009 position:50% align:center
Which means I shouldn't let on
that I know what's been going on

00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:14.427 position:50% align:center
in the outside world.

00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:16.930 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Great idea! That could be fun!

00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:19.766 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Ooh, it could also be
fun to pretend I'm acquiring

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:21.393 position:50% align:center
Faust right in front of him!

00:18:21.476 --> 00:18:25.021 position:50% align:center
"What's this? So this is
the evolution of a skill!

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:29.192 position:50% align:center
My unique skill Investigator is
now the ultimate skill Faust!

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:31.194 position:50% align:center
What an unexpected surprise!

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:33.530 position:50% align:center
This is the power to find
the ultimate truth

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:35.990 position:50% align:center
that my inquisitive
spirit has longed for!"

00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:38.284 position:50% align:center
Then he'll say, "Cool, Veldora!

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:41.329 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you got
an ultimate skill so easily!

00:18:41.413 --> 00:18:42.664 position:50% align:center
You're the GOAT!"

00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:45.250 position:50% align:center
Or... something else
I don't understand.

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:47.335 position:50% align:center
Rimuru will shower
me with praise from

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:48.837 position:50% align:center
the bottom of his heart.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.797 position:50% align:center
It will be glorious!

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.133 position:50% align:center
"Please, it's nothing."
I'll say.

00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:55.552 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:57.512 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT groans]
Lord Veldora,

00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:59.639 position:50% align:center
forgive me if this
is presumptuous,

00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:03.143 position:50% align:center
but if you wish to stand by Lord
Rimuru's side as his friend.

00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:05.437 position:50% align:center
You must remember that he
is the one who will be blamed

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.981 position:50% align:center
for any of the actions
that you perform.

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:11.151 position:50% align:center
Are you familiar with
the phrase "unwanted favor"?

00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:12.527 position:50% align:center
I heard it once.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.904 position:50% align:center
It basically means that
something you did as a favor

00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:18.158 position:50% align:center
might actually be unwanted
by the intended recipient.

00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:19.576 position:50% align:center
Does that make sense?

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:22.620 position:50% align:center
In your case, since
you have so much power.

00:19:22.704 --> 00:19:24.873 position:50% align:center
I think you should always
consult with your companions

00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:26.499 position:50% align:center
before you do anything.

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:28.126 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
I see...

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:29.502 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Listen to me.

00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:31.921 position:50% align:center
You don't want Lord Rimuru
to hate you, right?

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:33.089 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
I'd cry...

00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:35.842 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT] Okay. Then don't
do anything rash.

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:39.679 position:50% align:center
Act with caution, prudence,
and care at all times.

00:19:39.763 --> 00:19:41.139 position:50% align:center
Do you promise?

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:44.309 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA] Of course I do!
And I have another promise.

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:45.310 position:50% align:center
For you...

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:46.353 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
What is it?

00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:47.854 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
One day,

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:51.358 position:50% align:center
no matter what it takes, I shall
free you from this place.

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:53.151 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT gasps]
Really?!

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:55.779 position:50% align:center
I will be counting down
the days until you do!

00:19:55.862 --> 00:19:57.238 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Worry not, Ifrit.

00:19:57.322 --> 00:19:59.449 position:50% align:center
Just like my
dear friend, Rimuru,

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:01.868 position:50% align:center
I always keep my promises.

00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:03.953 position:50% align:center
And I'm certain
that with my skills,

00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:06.373 position:50% align:center
fulfilling this particular
promise to you won't take me

00:20:06.456 --> 00:20:08.083 position:50% align:center
too terribly long.

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:10.168 position:50% align:center
Can I still count
on you from now on?

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:12.212 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
Yes. Of course!

00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:15.590 position:50% align:center
When that time comes,
let us play shogi again.

00:20:15.674 --> 00:20:17.217 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
I won't go easy on you.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.468 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT]
That's perfect!

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:19.469 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Good!

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:23.723 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:30.980 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
This place brings back memories.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.529 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] How have
two years already passed?

00:20:37.612 --> 00:20:38.822 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Notice.

00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:41.825 position:50% align:center
Appraisal of Unlimited
Imprisonment is complete.

00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:44.160 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I can finally
fulfill my promise.

00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:47.706 position:50% align:center
I'll set you free now.
Let's do this, Veldora.

00:20:49.207 --> 00:20:51.209 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:54.671 position:50% align:center
Am I... taller?

00:20:54.754 --> 00:20:58.550 position:50% align:center
[groans] Raphael.
Make a double of my body.

00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:00.593 position:50% align:center
That way Veldora can inhabit it.

00:21:00.677 --> 00:21:02.887 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Activating Enhanced Body Double.

00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:08.018 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]

00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:11.104 position:50% align:center
Dang. I did mature a bit.

00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:12.480 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:16.443 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
If I do say so myself,

00:21:16.526 --> 00:21:18.653 position:50% align:center
I'm kind of a hottie.

00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:20.989 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Ahem.

00:21:21.072 --> 00:21:22.824 position:50% align:center
Okay, task at hand.

00:21:37.714 --> 00:21:38.965 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA roars]

00:21:43.553 --> 00:21:46.181 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]
Please work...

00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:51.853 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Notice.
Soul corridor between Master

00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:54.731 position:50% align:center
and the individual
named Veldora confirmed.

00:21:54.814 --> 00:21:55.940 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:22:10.705 --> 00:22:13.291 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA laughs]

00:22:13.375 --> 00:22:16.169 position:50% align:center
I am the Storm Dragon,
Veldora Tempest!

00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:18.296 position:50% align:center
Revived!

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.506 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:22:19.589 --> 00:22:23.176 position:50% align:center
And those who defy me
will be slaughtered!

00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:27.681 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
