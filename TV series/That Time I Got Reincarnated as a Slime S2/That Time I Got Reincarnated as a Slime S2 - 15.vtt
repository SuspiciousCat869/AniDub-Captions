[LAPLACE]
Ow, ow, ow...

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:41.541 position:50% align:center
What the heck is your problem?

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:44.336 position:50% align:center
This place is supposed
to be sacred.

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:47.088 position:50% align:center
So why is there a vampire here?

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:48.423 position:50% align:center
That is quite enough!

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:50.842 position:50% align:center
How dare you taint
the holy throne of God!

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:53.303 position:50% align:center
Anyone who disgraces the one
and only god, Luminus,

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.013 position:50% align:center
will not be tolerated!

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:58.224 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
Not good!

00:00:58.308 --> 00:00:59.642 position:50% align:center
[ROY]
Begone!

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.314 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
Farewell, cruel world...

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:37.741 position:50% align:center
[YUUKI]
Well, Laplace.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.826 position:50% align:center
You've been through
quite the ordeal.

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.621 position:50% align:center
So, did you find out what the
Western Holy Church really is?

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:46.166 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
Yeah, here's the thing...

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.336 position:50% align:center
Security was so tight,
I couldn't get in!

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.504 position:50% align:center
[YUUKI]
Hmm. Is that so?

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:53.131 position:50% align:center
Surely you found
a hint, at least?

00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:55.425 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE] You know, I went
through hell to get this info,

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:57.969 position:50% align:center
so I was gonna pitch it
for a high price.

00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:00.513 position:50% align:center
[YUUKI chuckles]
Too bad I know you're a liar.

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:02.307 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
You're so mean.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.393 position:50% align:center
I actually feel just a tad bit
sorry for that slime.

00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:08.730 position:50% align:center
He has no idea he's wrapped up
in your little scheme.

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:12.650 position:50% align:center
After all... You are an evil
mastermind hiding behind

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:16.029 position:50% align:center
the face of a young,
handsome Grandmaster,

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:18.239 position:50% align:center
Yuuki Kagurazaka.

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:20.408 position:50% align:center
While I appreciate
the clumsy flattery,

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:22.786 position:50% align:center
there's no backing out
of the job, Laplace.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.996 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
You're indomitable, aren't you?

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.581 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't say that.

00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:29.250 position:50% align:center
I've already prepared
the reward I promised you.

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:30.502 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
What? Really?!

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:32.962 position:50% align:center
Yeah! The soul of
your alliance's president,

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:36.341 position:50% align:center
which was inside me, is now
safely inside of a homunculus.

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:39.594 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
The president... is coming back?

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:41.346 position:50% align:center
Where is he? I wanna see him!

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:44.474 position:50% align:center
Contain yourself. He's been
right there this whole time.

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:45.975 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
What?!

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.105 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
Uh! But that's a lady.

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:54.275 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE cackles]

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.777 position:50% align:center
What's with the new look?!

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.363 position:50% align:center
Did your tastes
change or something?

00:03:58.446 --> 00:04:00.323 position:50% align:center
Mind your tongue, Laplace.

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:03.076 position:50% align:center
Appearances aside,
I am the Demon Lord Kazalim.

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.662 position:50% align:center
I expect a nicer greeting
after 200 years.

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:09.666 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE grunts] Welcome back,
President Kazalim.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.502 position:50% align:center
The Moderate Harlequin Alliance
has been waiting for you.

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:15.255 position:50% align:center
Myself, along with
Footman and Tear,

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:18.258 position:50% align:center
and we mustn't forget Clayman.

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:22.095 position:50% align:center
As much as I hate to put a
damper on this touching reunion,

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:24.097 position:50% align:center
I should tell you
that the Demon Lord Kazalim

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.141 position:50% align:center
isn't fully revived yet.

00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:28.018 position:50% align:center
That's true. In all honesty,

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:31.813 position:50% align:center
my power is nowhere near the
level I had back in my prime.

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:35.025 position:50% align:center
Leon Cromwell...
Curse that bastard!

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.693 position:50% align:center
[YUUKI] I really wish you
wouldn't complain about

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50% align:center
your new body so much.
It was an expensive vessel.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.032 position:50% align:center
[KAZALIM]
Yes, I'm aware, Boss.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.367 position:50% align:center
Custom-made in Thalion, right?

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:47.954 position:50% align:center
It's a bit fragile, and it's not
a look I would usually favor,

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:50.749 position:50% align:center
but I suppose it's preferable
to not having a material body

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:51.791 position:50% align:center
of my own at all.

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.918 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE laughs]

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.838 position:50% align:center
[KAZALIM] Enough! Is this really
so amusing to you, Laplace?!

00:04:56.921 --> 00:05:01.343 position:50% align:center
Anyway, as interesting as this
is, let's get down to business.

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:05.513 position:50% align:center
The Western Holy Church...
Wanna tell me what you know?

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:08.016 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE] All right. If the
president calls you "Boss,"

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.894 position:50% align:center
then I guess that makes
you my boss, too.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:14.481 position:50% align:center
Lucky you, this information
is now on the house.

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:17.150 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE] At first glance,
there was nothing in

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:19.903 position:50% align:center
the Western Holy Church that
seemed particularly dodgy.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:22.155 position:50% align:center
I mean, believers
go there to worship.

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:25.033 position:50% align:center
They're not gonna leave their
secrets just lying around.

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:27.702 position:50% align:center
I decided to head to the top
of the sacred mountain

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:30.288 position:50% align:center
and peek at the old peak.
I thought maybe there'd be

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:33.500 position:50% align:center
something in the inner sanctum
where the emperor's cloistered.

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:37.379 position:50% align:center
And there was, but it was just
some hoity-toity vampire guy.

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:38.922 position:50% align:center
He must have been cranky,

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:42.050 position:50% align:center
because he absolutely destroyed
me with some sort of red beam.

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:44.678 position:50% align:center
You look good for
someone who's "destroyed."

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:47.305 position:50% align:center
Wait, you said he shot
a red beam at you?

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.640 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
Yep.

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:51.017 position:50% align:center
An attack that turns blood
into magic particles.

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.977 position:50% align:center
It sounds a lot like Blood Ray.

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:54.312 position:50% align:center
I know that one.

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:56.731 position:50% align:center
It's Demon Lord Valentine's
signature attack.

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:58.233 position:50% align:center
He's called the Blood Tyrant.

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.318 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
A Demon Lord? Seriously?!

00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:02.696 position:50% align:center
[KAZALIM] Fleeing was
the right choice, Laplace.

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.114 position:50% align:center
Even when I was in my prime,

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.116 position:50% align:center
I'd say he was still
a level match for me.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.076 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
No way!

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:09.536 position:50% align:center
[KAZALIM]
Whenever we fought in the past,

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:12.831 position:50% align:center
the collateral damage was
always quite substantial.

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:15.208 position:50% align:center
So, we had a discussion,
and it led to the custom

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:17.627 position:50% align:center
that exists today
of the majority vote.

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:19.879 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you talking
about Walpurgis?

00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:22.799 position:50% align:center
[KAZALIM] Yes. The requirement
of three votes to move forward

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.718 position:50% align:center
on a proposal is from
the time when there were

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.011 position:50% align:center
seven Demon Lords.

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:27.804 position:50% align:center
So, if we know that
this guy really was

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:29.597 position:50% align:center
the Demon Lord Valentine,

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:32.392 position:50% align:center
I wonder what he's doing
in the inner sanctum.

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.561 position:50% align:center
The most likely explanation
is that the cloistered emperor

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:37.147 position:50% align:center
was actually a Demon
Lord this whole time.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.398 position:50% align:center
Am I right?

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.442 position:50% align:center
[KAZALIM] Valentine sees
humans and demi-humans

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:42.444 position:50% align:center
as no more than food.

00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:44.571 position:50% align:center
But if such a man is now
claiming himself to be

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.032 position:50% align:center
the guardian of humanity...

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:49.909 position:50% align:center
There must be something to it.

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:52.078 position:50% align:center
This information
has proved useful!

00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:54.581 position:50% align:center
Thank you for
getting it, Laplace.

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:56.750 position:50% align:center
I would like to investigate
the Western Holy Church

00:06:56.833 --> 00:07:00.337 position:50% align:center
even further, but if the
Demon Lord Valentine is there,

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.880 position:50% align:center
I guess we can't be careless.

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:05.008 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE] Ah! Wait, if you just
want to lure out a Demon Lord,

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.634 position:50% align:center
it shouldn't be that
difficult, right?

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:08.553 position:50% align:center
[YUUKI gasps]

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:11.931 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE] Clayman, Demon Lord
Milim, and Demon Lord Frey--

00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:15.852 position:50% align:center
an alliance of three Demon Lords
could accomplish a lot.

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:20.231 position:50% align:center
So, here's an idea:
Let them have Walpurgis.

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:25.445 position:50% align:center
For a clown,
it's not a bad idea.

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:27.489 position:50% align:center
[LAPLACE]
I know!

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:31.910 position:50% align:center
Now then, what will
the squishy one do?

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:34.537 position:50% align:center
Your move, slime.

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:40.752 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA] Next up, we have our
new second secretary, Diablo.

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:43.213 position:50% align:center
Yes. A pleasure to meet you all.

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:46.591 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA] Next is the caretaker
of the Forest of Jura.

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:49.094 position:50% align:center
I am the Dryad Treyni.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.013 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA] This concludes
the introductions of

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
our members from Tempest.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:56.893 position:50% align:center
It is now time for me to
introduce our honored guests.

00:07:56.976 --> 00:08:00.522 position:50% align:center
From the Armed Nation of
Dwargon, King Gazel Dwargo.

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:01.815 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL]
Hmm.

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:03.858 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA] From the
Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion,

00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:05.151 position:50% align:center
Archduke Erald.

00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:06.569 position:50% align:center
How do you do?

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:08.655 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA] From the Animal
Kingdom of Eurazania,

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:10.573 position:50% align:center
we have the Three Beastketeers:

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:14.160 position:50% align:center
Lady Albis, Lady Suphia,
and Sir Phobio.

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:17.831 position:50% align:center
From the Kingdom of Blumund,
we have Guildmaster Fuze.

00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:19.416 position:50% align:center
Uh, Hi.

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:22.335 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA] And lastly, representing
the future Kingdom of Falmuth,

00:08:22.419 --> 00:08:26.297 position:50% align:center
we have Sir Grucius,
Lady Mjurran, and Sir Youm.

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:28.174 position:50% align:center
[coughs]

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:29.884 position:50% align:center
Thank you. Greetings, all.

00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:31.803 position:50% align:center
[DORF]
Hmm?

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:35.974 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Jeez. Pretty prominent
bunch of people we've got here.

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:37.225 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:39.811 position:50% align:center
Shuna, what's Veldora doing?

00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:41.521 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA] Oh. He was
just changing his outfit

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:43.440 position:50% align:center
before the big meeting.

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:48.570 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:51.322 position:50% align:center
Sorry I'm late! I'm here now.

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:53.700 position:50% align:center
Wow. You look quite dashing!

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:55.785 position:50% align:center
The clothes appear to be
the perfect size!

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.162 position:50% align:center
Tell me about it!

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:59.289 position:50% align:center
It's comfortable
but also stylish!

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:00.832 position:50% align:center
You have my compliments!

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:03.793 position:50% align:center
--[laughs]
--[SHUNA] Thanks so much!

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:05.712 position:50% align:center
Rimuru. Does he work for you?

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:07.088 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA]
Hmm?

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:08.798 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL]
I haven't seen him before.

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:11.092 position:50% align:center
Oh. He's actually
a buddy of mine--

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:14.929 position:50% align:center
let me introduce you to him.
His name is Veldora.

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:15.930 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL]
Veldora?!

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:16.931 position:50% align:center
[ERALD]
Veldora?

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:19.142 position:50% align:center
[FUZE]
Veldora...?

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:23.521 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA roars]

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:29.694 position:50% align:center
Yep, I'm the great Storm Dragon,
Veldora Tempest!

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:32.238 position:50% align:center
Very few people have had
a chance to speak with me

00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:35.950 position:50% align:center
and live to tell the tale.
You are all extremely fortunate!

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:37.369 position:50% align:center
You should consider
this an honor!

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:38.953 position:50% align:center
[thump]

00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:41.039 position:50% align:center
[EREN]
Oops, we lost Fuze again.

00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:42.332 position:50% align:center
Poor guy.

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.376 position:50% align:center
Strange. He passed out from joy.

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:47.128 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I doubt it.
Listen, Veldora.

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:49.923 position:50% align:center
We're about to have a serious
discussion between adults here,

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:52.217 position:50% align:center
so don't do anything too crazy.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.719 position:50% align:center
During the meeting, I'd like
you to act as an advisor,

00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:56.680 position:50% align:center
but please, behave yourself.

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:59.766 position:50% align:center
Unless you'd rather go
take a walk--that's cool, too.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:02.644 position:50% align:center
[VELDORA laughs]
That's hilarious, buddy!

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:04.104 position:50% align:center
But no can do!

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:06.731 position:50% align:center
You can't just leave your BFF
to sit on the sidelines!

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:08.566 position:50% align:center
--[GAZEL] Rimuru!
--[RIMURU] Hmm?

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.276 position:50% align:center
I must speak with you...

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.697 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Uh. Sure, whatever you need.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.700 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] And so, our very
important meeting to determine

00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:19.828 position:50% align:center
the future of Tempest
was postponed

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:22.706 position:50% align:center
before it ever officially began.

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:27.335 position:50% align:center
[SHUNA] Please call
if you need anything.

00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:29.129 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU groans]

00:10:33.008 --> 00:10:34.217 position:50% align:center
What is going on?!

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.678 position:50% align:center
Has the Storm Dragon
Veldora really returned?!

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:39.305 position:50% align:center
Look, I can explain,
but it's a long story.

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:41.516 position:50% align:center
[ERALD] Before you do that,
let me say one thing.

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.393 position:50% align:center
Uh, okay.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:44.978 position:50% align:center
I just want you to know
that the emperor of

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.355 position:50% align:center
the Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion
has entrusted me

00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:49.357 position:50% align:center
with complete authority.

00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:52.777 position:50% align:center
And whatever I say
dictates Thalion's position.

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:57.157 position:50% align:center
Now, with that in mind,
let's hear this explanation.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.908 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Message received, man.

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:01.995 position:50% align:center
I promise to tell you
guys the truth!

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:07.000 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
So, I told them the whole story.

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:10.754 position:50% align:center
Including how I got
reincarnated here as a slime.

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:14.299 position:50% align:center
And that I met Veldora
in the Sealed Cave.

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:16.593 position:50% align:center
All the way to the bit where
I became a Demon Lord

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:20.138 position:50% align:center
for certain reasons, and revived
friends who had been killed,

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:23.683 position:50% align:center
ending with the part where
I finally released Velodra.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:28.396 position:50% align:center
There. That should
bring you guys up to speed.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.523 position:50% align:center
--[GAZEL, ERALD sigh]
--Uh, something wrong?!

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:32.317 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL]
I never imagined this...

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.612 position:50% align:center
It was problematic enough
that you became a Demon Lord,

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:38.198 position:50% align:center
but you had an even bigger
problem waiting for us.

00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:40.283 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Please!
It's not that big of a deal!

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:41.701 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL growls]

00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:44.454 position:50% align:center
Mister Rimuru... Is that
boisterous young man we met

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.664 position:50% align:center
truly the Storm Dragon
known as Veldora?

00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:47.707 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Is he? Who knows?

00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:49.918 position:50% align:center
That's a rhetorical question!

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:52.170 position:50% align:center
No human or monster is foolish
enough to use the name

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:54.839 position:50% align:center
of the Evil Dragon,
even as a silly jest.

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:58.259 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Fair enough...

00:11:58.343 --> 00:11:59.552 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL]
Still...

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:01.471 position:50% align:center
[ERALD]
What to do?

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:04.182 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL] Do we make this
public or conceal it?

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:07.852 position:50% align:center
Well, either way, the Western
Nations won't be an issue.

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:09.437 position:50% align:center
As for the Sorcerous
Dynasty of Thalion,

00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:12.148 position:50% align:center
I need only report this newfound
knowledge to the emperor.

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:13.650 position:50% align:center
My biggest concern...

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:15.819 position:50% align:center
...is the Western Holy Church.

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:16.945 position:50% align:center
[ERALD]
Hmm.

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:18.738 position:50% align:center
We can't hide this from them.

00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:21.199 position:50% align:center
Out of all the Dragons,
they regard the Storm Dragon

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:23.535 position:50% align:center
with a rather
particular hostility.

00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:25.620 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I wouldn't
be surprised

00:12:25.704 --> 00:12:27.914 position:50% align:center
if they already knew
he had returned.

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:32.752 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU sighs] Is it just me or
do those two actually get along?

00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:34.087 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL]
Pay attention, Rimuru!

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.672 position:50% align:center
Right! Yes, sir!

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:38.299 position:50% align:center
[ERALD] We need you to give
serious thought to this matter!

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:40.802 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:42.554 position:50% align:center
Thing is, I was planning
to spread the word

00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:44.139 position:50% align:center
about Veldora, anyway.

00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:45.890 position:50% align:center
And it doesn't seem like
there'll be any avoiding

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:47.851 position:50% align:center
the Western Holy Church.

00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:50.103 position:50% align:center
So we'll have to do something.

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:51.521 position:50% align:center
[ERALD, GAZEL]
Hmm...

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.815 position:50% align:center
If that's the decision,
I suppose I have no complaints.

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:55.191 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:57.652 position:50% align:center
[ERALD] A Demon Lord
aligning with the Evil Dragon.

00:12:57.736 --> 00:13:00.280 position:50% align:center
Could there ever be a more
troubling turn of events?

00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:02.824 position:50% align:center
This is no laughing matter.

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:05.326 position:50% align:center
That said,
it might be fortunate.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.704 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Hmm? Wait, how so?

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:09.581 position:50% align:center
[ERALD slurps]

00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:13.209 position:50% align:center
Well, since I was able to take
part in this private meeting,

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:15.545 position:50% align:center
I've just gained the best
possible knowledge.

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:18.965 position:50% align:center
It will be advantageous
for my nation's position.

00:13:19.049 --> 00:13:20.550 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL]
Hmm.

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:21.968 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Ah.

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:23.762 position:50% align:center
[ERALD] It'd be foolish to
pick a fight with a nation

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:26.389 position:50% align:center
that's home to both a Demon
Lord and the Storm Dragon.

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:28.016 position:50% align:center
My thoughts, exactly.

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:31.561 position:50% align:center
I gotcha. So basically,
you're saying that even if

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:34.773 position:50% align:center
the Western Holy Church becomes
our enemy, you'll take our side.

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:36.816 position:50% align:center
Is that a fair conclusion?

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.070 position:50% align:center
Rimuru... There are still
things you must learn,

00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:42.864 position:50% align:center
like the subtle art of
the unspoken message, got it?

00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:44.991 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Oh, right...

00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:48.078 position:50% align:center
I'm saying... I refuse
to expose my country

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:51.623 position:50% align:center
to pointless danger when there
isn't any reason for hostility.

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:55.126 position:50% align:center
We are under no obligation
to the Western Holy Church.

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.628 position:50% align:center
Understand?

00:13:56.711 --> 00:14:00.382 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It'll be reassuring to
have Dwargon backing us up.

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:02.592 position:50% align:center
Erald, what about you?

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:04.761 position:50% align:center
We haven't established
diplomatic relations

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:07.430 position:50% align:center
with Thalion, so why are
you being so friendly?

00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:08.848 position:50% align:center
[ERALD sighs]

00:14:08.932 --> 00:14:11.518 position:50% align:center
Now, Mister Rimuru,
in formal settings,

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:14.145 position:50% align:center
please address me
with my name and title.

00:14:14.229 --> 00:14:16.606 position:50% align:center
After all, you're the
leader of a country.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.692 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't humble
yourself before another nation

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:20.235 position:50% align:center
for no reason.

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:22.862 position:50% align:center
So, in these moments, it's
appropriate to address me

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:24.489 position:50% align:center
with a "mister."

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:28.660 position:50% align:center
Oh, I hear ya. Thank you.

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:32.372 position:50% align:center
[ERALD] That aside... Allow me
to answer your question.

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:34.416 position:50% align:center
I assume my daughter, Eren--

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:35.583 position:50% align:center
--[GAZEL] Hmm?!
--[RIMURU gasps]

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:38.420 position:50% align:center
[ERALD]
Uh... [coughs] I mean, Eryune,

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:39.963 position:50% align:center
is the person who
told you how to go about

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:41.631 position:50% align:center
becoming a Demon Lord,

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:44.968 position:50% align:center
making me responsible
for this situation.

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:47.012 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Now then,
tell me this fairy tale

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:48.263 position:50% align:center
about reviving the dead.

00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:50.223 position:50% align:center
[EREN]
Mm.

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:51.725 position:50% align:center
[ERALD]
When it's all said and done,

00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:53.810 position:50% align:center
one could say that my
daughter helped to create

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.687 position:50% align:center
a brand-new Demon Lord.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.398 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, only the
emperor and I are privy

00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:00.442 position:50% align:center
to this information.

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:03.695 position:50% align:center
So you see, this
is why I came here--

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:06.656 position:50% align:center
to personally judge you for
myself and to possibly dispatch

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.702 position:50% align:center
an army in kind if I deemed it
necessary during my visit.

00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:13.496 position:50% align:center
And now? What's your decision?

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.331 position:50% align:center
I thought I made
my choice clear.

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:16.958 position:50% align:center
We're not a nation of fools.

00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:19.002 position:50% align:center
A simple decision, really.

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:20.628 position:50% align:center
And a rather
obvious one at that--

00:15:20.712 --> 00:15:23.214 position:50% align:center
my country had every intention
of backing Tempest as friends

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:24.883 position:50% align:center
from the very beginning.

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:26.301 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:29.137 position:50% align:center
Though, there are some
things to consider.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.182 position:50% align:center
The army of Falmuth that
Mister Rimuru annihilated--

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:34.893 position:50% align:center
It had far too many casualties.

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:37.896 position:50% align:center
A Demon Lord who
killed 20,000 men?

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:39.272 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL]
Don't worry about that.

00:15:39.356 --> 00:15:40.607 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Mm?

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.109 position:50% align:center
All the bodies have
vanished, leaving no proof.

00:15:43.193 --> 00:15:47.113 position:50% align:center
What's more, I heard there
wasn't even a single survivor.

00:15:47.197 --> 00:15:50.241 position:50% align:center
Which means we can alter
the story as we please.

00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:51.826 position:50% align:center
We'll just need to convince
those who happen

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.537 position:50% align:center
to hear the truth.

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:57.999 position:50% align:center
Rimuru. A true leader
must have no regrets.

00:15:58.083 --> 00:16:01.670 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I only did
what I felt was necessary.

00:16:01.753 --> 00:16:04.839 position:50% align:center
I've already come
to terms with it.

00:16:04.923 --> 00:16:08.593 position:50% align:center
[GAZEL] Good to hear.
Heh. Right then, I'll explain.

00:16:08.677 --> 00:16:12.097 position:50% align:center
Listen closely.
This is our new story...

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:17.185 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] After that, we had
a very detailed discussion

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:20.355 position:50% align:center
then headed back
to resume the meeting.

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:24.234 position:50% align:center
[FUZE sighs]

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.695 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
You okay?

00:16:26.778 --> 00:16:29.781 position:50% align:center
[FUZE wheezes]
You gotta tell me this stuff!

00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:32.409 position:50% align:center
Stop blindsiding me
left and right!

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:33.952 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
It must have slipped my mind.

00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:36.371 position:50% align:center
No worries, it's all
in the past now!

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:37.706 position:50% align:center
[FUZE]
Not for me, it isn't!

00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:39.582 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Aw, sounds like
you're feeling better!

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:43.378 position:50% align:center
No. How am I supposed
to report this news?

00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:45.005 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:16:45.088 --> 00:16:47.590 position:50% align:center
Okay! Time to
resume the meeting!

00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:50.719 position:50% align:center
I'll start by explaining
how we got here.

00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:53.388 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I then explained
my reincarnation as a slime

00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:56.141 position:50% align:center
yet again, followed by
everything that happened

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:58.727 position:50% align:center
from stumbling on Veldora
up to the meeting.

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:00.145 position:50% align:center
And then...

00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:03.231 position:50% align:center
Your city's in my way.
Not for long.

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:05.233 position:50% align:center
Since I intend to destroy it.

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:07.652 position:50% align:center
I don't care about
a monster's words!

00:17:07.736 --> 00:17:09.154 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU grunts]

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:15.076 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
Put an end to this.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.162 position:50% align:center
Disintegration!

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:41.519 position:50% align:center
Hold on... You fought Hinata
Sakaguchi and walked away?

00:17:41.603 --> 00:17:44.898 position:50% align:center
Yeah. And her strength
is no joke, man.

00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:47.609 position:50% align:center
During our fight, she refused
to listen to me at all.

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:51.529 position:50% align:center
She had this real "cold-blooded
killer" kinda vibe going on.

00:17:51.613 --> 00:17:52.614 position:50% align:center
[FUZE]
Hmm...

00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:54.115 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
What's up?

00:17:54.199 --> 00:17:56.201 position:50% align:center
[FUZE] Oh. It's just that
your account differs a little

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:58.703 position:50% align:center
from the information
we had collected on her.

00:17:58.787 --> 00:17:59.996 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
How so?

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.707 position:50% align:center
[FUZE] Things like,
Hinata always lends a hand

00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:05.126 position:50% align:center
to those who might
depend on her.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:08.880 position:50% align:center
She won't waste her time on
anyone who ignores her advice.

00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:10.423 position:50% align:center
Still though...

00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:14.177 position:50% align:center
She's rational and is known to
be a rather reasonable thinker.

00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:18.598 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Of course, I'd heard
that Blumund's Guildmaster

00:18:18.682 --> 00:18:20.892 position:50% align:center
was someone who excelled
at gathering intel,

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:24.312 position:50% align:center
and I can testify that his
information matches our own.

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:27.107 position:50% align:center
[ERALD] It matches the
information we have, as well.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:30.235 position:50% align:center
Hinata Sakaguchi is renowned
for being a model knight--

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:32.320 position:50% align:center
A true protector
of law and order.

00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:36.658 position:50% align:center
Not once has she ever violated
the teachings of Lord Luminus.

00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:39.536 position:50% align:center
But if she's that great,
then why doesn't she try to stop

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:41.705 position:50% align:center
the summoning ritual?

00:18:41.788 --> 00:18:44.332 position:50% align:center
In my opinion, bringing children
here from another world

00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:48.670 position:50% align:center
against their will is something
that should never be tolerated.

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:51.464 position:50% align:center
Do we know for certain that she
overlooked the summoning rituals

00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:55.176 position:50% align:center
in other countries? Or are we
just assuming that information?

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.221 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Mm? Hmm...

00:18:58.304 --> 00:19:00.473 position:50% align:center
[FUZE] The magic used
to summon Otherworlders is

00:19:00.557 --> 00:19:03.935 position:50% align:center
a forbidden ritual that cannot
be exposed to the public eye.

00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:06.688 position:50% align:center
In fact, it's designated
as a prohibited act by

00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:08.565 position:50% align:center
the Council of the West.

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:10.233 position:50% align:center
Even if we were to ask about it,

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:13.737 position:50% align:center
no nation would readily
acknowledge the practice.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.990 position:50% align:center
So if they say it's not
happening, that's it, huh?

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:18.575 position:50% align:center
[FUZE]
Right.

00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:20.452 position:50% align:center
To be honest, there's probably
a good reason you've never heard

00:19:20.535 --> 00:19:22.746 position:50% align:center
any of this.
It goes back to the church.

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:25.040 position:50% align:center
The teachings of Lord Luminus
specifically forbid

00:19:25.123 --> 00:19:27.000 position:50% align:center
making deals with a monster.

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:31.796 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Meaning I have
no real chance of negotiating.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.884 position:50% align:center
And if the Western Holy Church
designates us as enemies of God,

00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:38.219 position:50% align:center
Hinata will go along
with that, right?

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:40.638 position:50% align:center
[FUZE]
It's quite possible.

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:43.308 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO chuckles]

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:45.393 position:50% align:center
Then, please, allow
me to go and handle

00:19:45.477 --> 00:19:47.062 position:50% align:center
this opponent in your place.

00:19:47.145 --> 00:19:50.106 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Whoa, whoa.
Hinata's a tough cookie.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.858 position:50% align:center
You think you could take her?

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:53.234 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
That's right, Diablo.

00:19:53.318 --> 00:19:54.486 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Hmm?

00:19:54.569 --> 00:19:56.363 position:50% align:center
If a weakling like you
is thinking of going,

00:19:56.446 --> 00:19:58.531 position:50% align:center
perhaps I should
finish the job instead.

00:19:58.615 --> 00:20:00.992 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru,
I shall take this task.

00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
That's such a generous
offer, Miss Shion,

00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:05.622 position:50% align:center
and I do hesitate to say
this after you took the time

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:08.416 position:50% align:center
to teach me how to be
a proper secretary.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.877 position:50% align:center
But, unfortunately, you are
not capable of defeating

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.337 position:50% align:center
this Hinata person.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.089 position:50% align:center
What a funny thing to say.

00:20:14.172 --> 00:20:15.632 position:50% align:center
Are you actually trying to imply

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:17.801 position:50% align:center
that you're stronger
than me, Diablo?

00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:19.928 position:50% align:center
Shall we find out
once and for all who's--

00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:21.262 position:50% align:center
No, you shall not!

00:20:21.346 --> 00:20:22.681 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasping]

00:20:22.764 --> 00:20:25.433 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Veldora...? Don't tell me...

00:20:25.517 --> 00:20:27.560 position:50% align:center
Oh, wait, Veldora
as in me, Veldora?

00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:29.979 position:50% align:center
Heck no, I wasn't trying
to jump in or anything!

00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:31.606 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
If Hinata's going to come here,

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.566 position:50% align:center
then there's no need
for us to go there.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:35.276 position:50% align:center
Aw...

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.820 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
No whining!

00:20:36.903 --> 00:20:40.031 position:50% align:center
I don't want to get on the
Western Holy Church's bad side.

00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:41.491 position:50% align:center
That goes for you, too.

00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:43.284 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO, SHION]
Sorry, sir.

00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:46.788 position:50% align:center
Ahem! Anyway, that officially
concludes the debate

00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:48.415 position:50% align:center
on the knight
Hinata Sakaguchi,

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:50.542 position:50% align:center
and the Western Holy Church.

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:53.586 position:50% align:center
Depending on what they do,
we may end up fighting them.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.213 position:50% align:center
But for right now,
let's just keep an eye

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:57.048 position:50% align:center
on the situation, okay?

00:20:57.132 --> 00:20:58.842 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Understood!

00:21:00.677 --> 00:21:03.096 position:50% align:center
[HINATA] Don't play dumb,
I received an anonymous tip.

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:05.140 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]
Say what?

00:21:05.223 --> 00:21:07.142 position:50% align:center
You heard me,
there are eyes everywhere in

00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:09.853 position:50% align:center
the Kingdom of Ingrassia.

00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:12.439 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Someone sold me out to Hinata.

00:21:12.522 --> 00:21:15.942 position:50% align:center
There aren't many people who
know about how I absorbed Shizu.

00:21:16.026 --> 00:21:18.236 position:50% align:center
Meaning...

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:22.574 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Notice. This is
the most likely suspect.

00:21:22.657 --> 00:21:25.035 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Yeah. I know, Raphael.

00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:27.454 position:50% align:center
You and I are thinking
the same thing.

00:21:27.537 --> 00:21:29.039 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
So it seems.

00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:31.166 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] But if it is him,
what's he after?

00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:32.959 position:50% align:center
To pit me and Hinata
against each other

00:21:33.043 --> 00:21:34.711 position:50% align:center
to eliminate one of us?

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:37.172 position:50% align:center
To stop me from
getting back to my town?

00:21:37.255 --> 00:21:38.840 position:50% align:center
To lure out Hinata?

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:41.134 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Or D, all of the above.

00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:44.512 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Seriously? Talk about greedy.

00:21:44.596 --> 00:21:47.599 position:50% align:center
--[GAZEL] Rimuru?
--Huh? Sorry about that.

00:21:47.682 --> 00:21:49.851 position:50% align:center
I was just doing
some mental math.

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:52.645 position:50% align:center
Now, let's get down to business.

00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:57.484 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] At long last, the time
had finally come to bring up

00:21:57.567 --> 00:22:00.612 position:50% align:center
the agenda that would determine
the fate of Tempest.
