00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:20.228 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] But we're
commencing the operation

00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:21.896 position:50% align:center
to annihilate them immediately.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.732 position:50% align:center
There's absolutely
no time to waste.

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:26.651 position:50% align:center
We will revive
Shion and the others!

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:28.153 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Right!

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:32.824 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru.

00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:34.075 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Huh?

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:35.744 position:50% align:center
You might be different
after your evolution.

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:38.997 position:50% align:center
So, it would be wise if we came
up with some sort of password.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.665 position:50% align:center
Something to test
your reasoning.

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:41.791 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Any ideas?

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:42.792 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.836 position:50% align:center
How about...

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:46.588 position:50% align:center
"Shion's cooking
tastes like shit."

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:47.964 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:50.800 position:50% align:center
So I'll say, "Shion's
cooking..." and you respond,

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.052 position:50% align:center
"...tastes like shit."

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:53.928 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] What kind of
crap password is that?!

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:55.347 position:50% align:center
Shion'll be pissed!

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.307 position:50% align:center
Heh. Yes, it's perfect.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.726 position:50% align:center
It might make her angry enough
to wake up and complain.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.019 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:03.021 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Uh, I guess.

00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:05.190 position:50% align:center
Let's do it.

00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:07.734 position:50% align:center
We'll succeed. No matter what.

00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:11.029 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Yeah.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:47.375 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU groans]
What... happened?

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.254 position:50% align:center
Is everyone...
Was my evolution successful?

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.884 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Yes. Your
evolution to Demon Lord,

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:58.720 position:50% align:center
the Harvest Festival, was
completed successfully.

00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:00.722 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
That's good.

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:02.515 position:50% align:center
[SHION gasps]
Lord Rimuru!

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.767 position:50% align:center
You've finally awakened!

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.310 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Huh...?

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:09.731 position:50% align:center
[SHION chuckles]
Hello, sleepyhead. Good morning.

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:14.069 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
'Morning, Shion.

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:17.238 position:50% align:center
I'm happy to see
you've made it back to us.

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:20.450 position:50% align:center
[SHION] Yes. Thanks
to you, Lord Rimuru.

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:24.037 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Listen. Don't you ever
worry me like that again.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.247 position:50% align:center
That's an order.

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:29.292 position:50% align:center
Understood. I give you my word.

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:31.461 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru?

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:33.171 position:50% align:center
Hey, look, he's awake!

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.595 position:50% align:center
[SHION] Attention!
Lord Rimuru has succeeded

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.056 position:50% align:center
in bringing everyone
here back to life!

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.724 position:50% align:center
[CITIZENS]
We have all been resurrected

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.976 position:50% align:center
without a single
soul left behind.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.521 position:50% align:center
Thanks to our
ruler, Lord Rimuru.

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:52.440 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU sighs]
Yeah...

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:56.194 position:50% align:center
Huh? You guys all look...

00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:57.654 position:50% align:center
Hmm...

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:00.865 position:50% align:center
I dunno, kind of
different somehow.

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.159 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Notice.
All the individuals connected

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.869 position:50% align:center
to your soul have
been given gifts,

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:07.372 position:50% align:center
which have caused
them to evolve.

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:08.790 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Really?

00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:11.418 position:50% align:center
Also, is it just me or are you
speaking more fluently?

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.503 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] No. This is how
I have always spoken.

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:15.088 position:50% align:center
It's just your imagination.

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:16.715 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Yeah, you're probably right!

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.049 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:19.467 position:50% align:center
Wait! Like hell it is!

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:21.720 position:50% align:center
You can't kid
a kidder, Great Sage!

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:23.972 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Notice. The truth is,
that your unique skill

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:26.057 position:50% align:center
"Great Sage" evolved
into the ultimate skill

00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:27.642 position:50% align:center
known as "Raphael."

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:29.978 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Raphael? You must
be pretty amazeballs

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:31.563 position:50% align:center
if you have an angel's name!

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:34.024 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Indeed, there is no
question that I cannot answer.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:37.068 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Is that so?
Well, I'll look forward to that!

00:04:37.152 --> 00:04:39.529 position:50% align:center
But for real, you're speaking
more fluently, right?

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:41.197 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
No. It's your imagination.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:44.492 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] You're just gonna
stick to that story, huh?

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:45.869 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
By the way, my lord.

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.287 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Huh?

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.706 position:50% align:center
If you will, may I test
whether you retained yourself

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.500 position:50% align:center
through your evolution?
Per our last discussion.

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:53.793 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Uh?

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:54.919 position:50% align:center
So, Shion's cooking...

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:56.004 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU yelps]

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:57.172 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Hmph.

00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:59.841 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU whimpering]

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:01.968 position:50% align:center
What's that about
my cooking, Lord Rimuru?

00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:03.470 position:50% align:center
Please, tell me!

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:07.307 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU whimpers] I can't
respond with "Tastes like shit"!

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.184 position:50% align:center
Your answer? Come, my lord.

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:11.644 position:50% align:center
--[RIMURU] Uhh!
--Say it so we can be sure.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:13.355 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Benimaru!

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:15.857 position:50% align:center
Lord of Wisdom, Raphael!
You're up!

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.609 position:50% align:center
Use your wisdom to
give me a great answer

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:20.195 position:50% align:center
so I can fool Shion and live!

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:22.364 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Notice. The applicable answer...

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:23.573 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
What is it?!

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:24.574 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
...does not exist.

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:26.159 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]
You hack!

00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:28.870 position:50% align:center
What happened to the "There is
no question I cannot answer"?!

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:30.830 position:50% align:center
Go on, what'd you want
to say about my cooking?

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:33.917 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Bwuh?! Well, uh...

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.168 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU snickers]

00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:38.338 position:50% align:center
You want some, right?
You missed her terribly.

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:40.465 position:50% align:center
And you seemed so sad
you couldn't eat her food.

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:41.841 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
He set me up!

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:44.469 position:50% align:center
Is that really true?
I'll gladly make you something!

00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:46.554 position:50% align:center
--[giggles]
--[RIMURU whines]

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:48.848 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] However, I recommend
giving this answer.

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:51.601 position:50% align:center
--[RIMURU] Raphael!
--[RAPHAEL] Are you ready?

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.645 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Uh...? Huh?

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:56.564 position:50% align:center
Genius! That's my
Lord of Wisdom!

00:05:56.648 --> 00:05:58.316 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Ah, I remember now.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.568 position:50% align:center
Ahem. You're asking
me for the password

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:02.654 position:50% align:center
that you came up with, yes?

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:04.531 position:50% align:center
When you say,
"Shion's cooking,.."

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:06.449 position:50% align:center
I am supposed to
respond with the words,

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:07.617 position:50% align:center
"...tastes like shit."

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:09.119 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:11.663 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] You're the one who
told me to say that, right?

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.748 position:50% align:center
It. Was. All. You.

00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:15.500 position:50% align:center
Hey! Lord Rimuru!

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:17.168 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I recall it very clearly.

00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:19.087 position:50% align:center
That's the password
you came up with!

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.591 position:50% align:center
So, do you see now
that I still have my reason? Eh?

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:25.385 position:50% align:center
Uh. Wait, Shion!

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:27.387 position:50% align:center
Lord Rimuru is
obviously still confused,

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.097 position:50% align:center
having just awakened, you know?

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.808 position:50% align:center
--[RIMURU groans]
--[SHION] I understand.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:35.270 position:50% align:center
Sir Benimaru...
Rather, Benimaru.

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:37.772 position:50% align:center
Seeing as I serve
Lord Rimuru directly,

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:40.066 position:50% align:center
I don't need to use
your official title.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.276 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU gulps]

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:43.528 position:50% align:center
But fortunately for you,
I'm feeling generous

00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:47.198 position:50% align:center
and will gladly cook nonstop
until you burst from fullness.

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:48.616 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU groans]

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.993 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
Hmm.

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:53.913 position:50% align:center
[SHION laughs wickedly]

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:55.790 position:50% align:center
How could you do that to me?!

00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:57.876 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Do your best
to not die, my dude.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:00.086 position:50% align:center
You know that's impossible!

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.714 position:50% align:center
Although... I've taste-
tested her food before.

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:05.550 position:50% align:center
So I did learn Poison
Resistance recently.

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:07.594 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Whoa, for real?

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:10.180 position:50% align:center
Will it help? Who knows...

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:15.518 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Yeah, well.
You reap what you sow, man.

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:17.395 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes. I forgot.

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:19.189 position:50% align:center
There's no time
to contemplate my death.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:20.774 position:50% align:center
We still have a big problem.

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:22.275 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
We do?

00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:24.611 position:50% align:center
Indeed, it occurred during
the three days you were asleep.

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:26.988 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I was out for three days?!

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:28.907 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] Yes, and
something drastic happened

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.658 position:50% align:center
to our friends in Eurazania.

00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:31.910 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:42.671 position:50% align:center
[MILIM laughs]

00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:46.132 position:50% align:center
Greetings, Eurazania!
I'm Milim Nava!

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:47.676 position:50% align:center
And starting today,

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:51.221 position:50% align:center
I void any past agreements
between the Demon Lords.

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.765 position:50% align:center
I declare war on
the Beastmaster himself.

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:56.059 position:50% align:center
That's you, Demon Lord Carrion!

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.435 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:59.145 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:01.022 position:50% align:center
The war will begin in one week!

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:03.817 position:50% align:center
You'd better be ready,
and don't disappoint me!

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.277 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.489 position:50% align:center
Hold it right there!

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:11.658 position:50% align:center
Tell me why, Milim!

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:14.786 position:50% align:center
So it's war, then? Bring it on!

00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:16.996 position:50% align:center
I'll even take the lead
if you'll allow me to!

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.331 position:50% align:center
Wait, Suphia.

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:20.875 position:50% align:center
You don't know how powerful
Demon Lord Milim is.

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:23.503 position:50% align:center
Even if the entire Brigade
were to take her on at once,

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:24.671 position:50% align:center
she could just
slaughter everyone

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:26.297 position:50% align:center
with a flick of her wrist.

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:28.633 position:50% align:center
Oh, really? If that's
what you say after seeing

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:32.053 position:50% align:center
Milim's strength firsthand,
Phobio, it must be true.

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:35.140 position:50% align:center
So, of the two of us,
which one is stronger?

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:36.307 position:50% align:center
[PHOBIO gasps]

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:38.893 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:41.312 position:50% align:center
Though it pains me
a great deal to admit this,

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:43.690 position:50% align:center
she easily lives up
to her nickname.

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:46.317 position:50% align:center
Demon Lord Milim is
the Destroyer for a reason.

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:48.319 position:50% align:center
[CARRION]
Hmm. I see.

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:50.155 position:50% align:center
So you're saying
she's the stronger one.

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:52.365 position:50% align:center
[PHOBIO gasps]
No, sir! I didn't mean--

00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:54.909 position:50% align:center
If I turned tail just because
an enemy was strong,

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:57.287 position:50% align:center
then I'd be a sorry Demon Lord.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.999 position:50% align:center
Plus, it'll be fun to fight
the legendary Milim.

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:03.251 position:50% align:center
I can't pass up such an
interesting opportunity,

00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:04.461 position:50% align:center
now can I?

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.296 position:50% align:center
Go talk to our slime friend.

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:09.174 position:50% align:center
And send our citizens to
the Great Forest of Jura.

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:11.593 position:50% align:center
If they're still here when Milim
Nava and I start our fight,

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:13.094 position:50% align:center
there will be casualties.

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:16.348 position:50% align:center
Furthermore, no one shall
engage the Demon Lord but me.

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:17.432 position:50% align:center
What? But, sir--!

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:18.516 position:50% align:center
Let me fight, too!

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.768 position:50% align:center
Please! Allow us to assist you--

00:09:19.851 --> 00:09:22.270 position:50% align:center
That's enough!
Only I am capable of fighting

00:09:22.354 --> 00:09:25.440 position:50% align:center
Demon Lord Milim Nava,
do you understand?!

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:28.401 position:50% align:center
[CARRION] I want you three
to prioritize the safety

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:29.819 position:50% align:center
of our citizens.

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:32.739 position:50% align:center
I will not allow you to
intervene in our battle, got it?

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:33.740 position:50% align:center
[PHOBIO, ALBIS, SUPHIA]
Right!

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:37.369 position:50% align:center
Have faith. I'll win this fight.

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:39.287 position:50% align:center
[CARRION]
I didn't dislike you, Milim.

00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:42.791 position:50% align:center
We could have become
good friends. Pity.

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:46.044 position:50% align:center
[ALBIS]
And that's what happened.

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:48.838 position:50% align:center
She declared war ten days ago.

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:50.715 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU sighs]

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:52.717 position:50% align:center
And then, three days ago...

00:09:58.473 --> 00:10:02.227 position:50% align:center
[CARRION] Hey, Milim. What's up
with the declaration of war?

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:06.981 position:50% align:center
[CARRION] Hmm. Don't tell me
you're being controlled

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:10.694 position:50% align:center
or something? If that's true,
it's rather disappointing.

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:13.238 position:50% align:center
If I don't beat you at your
best, then I'll never be able

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:16.574 position:50% align:center
to prove that I'm the strongest
of the Demon Lords!

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:23.248 position:50% align:center
Behold! What you're seeing
is my Unique Skill.

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:25.291 position:50% align:center
It's Royal Beast Form!

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:29.963 position:50% align:center
For I am the Beast King!
Carrion the Beastmaster!

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:41.516 position:50% align:center
[MILIM]
Heh.

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.685 position:50% align:center
It's too bad,
but I can't let you leave

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:45.353 position:50% align:center
now that you've seen this form.

00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:47.689 position:50% align:center
Believe me when I say
it's not personal.

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:50.900 position:50% align:center
I'm done holding back.
It's time to end this!

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.111 position:50% align:center
[MILIM]
Heh!

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:55.030 position:50% align:center
This is where
you and I part ways!

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:57.407 position:50% align:center
Beast Roar!

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.133 position:50% align:center
[CARRION]
Ah...

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:23.391 position:50% align:center
[CARRION]
Milim Nava. The Destroyer.

00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:27.562 position:50% align:center
That's the real you, isn't it?
In your combat form.

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:29.856 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:31.649 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:33.318 position:50% align:center
That was actually fun.

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:36.488 position:50% align:center
It's been ages since
my left arm stung like that.

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:39.449 position:50% align:center
It's only fair that I find
a way to repay you.

00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:52.045 position:50% align:center
Drago-Nova!

00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:04.683 position:50% align:center
[CARRION gasps]

00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:10.480 position:50% align:center
[CARRION gasps]

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:20.448 position:50% align:center
[CARRION]
She's... on another level.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:31.918 position:50% align:center
[CARRION]
Yes.

00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:34.963 position:50% align:center
Milim just might be...

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Might be what?

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:39.551 position:50% align:center
I'd love to know your
thoughts, Lord Carrion.

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:42.262 position:50% align:center
The Sky Queen Frey.
Is that you?

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:43.680 position:50% align:center
Yes, naturally.

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.598 position:50% align:center
Ah. How annoying.

00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:48.351 position:50% align:center
[FREY] What?
Come now, that's just hurtful.

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:50.937 position:50% align:center
And here I was hoping
we could have a nice talk.

00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:52.981 position:50% align:center
[CARRION grunts]

00:12:53.064 --> 00:12:54.691 position:50% align:center
[slicing]

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:58.945 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Whoa, so Eurazania
was totally destroyed?

00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:01.489 position:50% align:center
Indeed. I witnessed
the whole thing.

00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:02.907 position:50% align:center
[GRUCIUS grunts]

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:05.118 position:50% align:center
[ALBIS] But we did evacuate
the citizens in advance,

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:06.494 position:50% align:center
so they are safe.

00:13:06.578 --> 00:13:08.788 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps] We need
to arrange lodging and food

00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:09.956 position:50% align:center
for the refugees!

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.667 position:50% align:center
Sir! While I hesitated to do so,

00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:14.586 position:50% align:center
I made arrangements
without permission.

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:16.588 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Oh, good. Excellent job.

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:17.589 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:19.341 position:50% align:center
We're grateful to you.

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:25.221 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Still, the Demon
Lord Frey was with Milim?

00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:27.557 position:50% align:center
We never imagined the
two of them would team up.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.352 position:50% align:center
What's more, to our knowledge,
Demon Lord Milim has always

00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:32.854 position:50% align:center
loathed those sorts
of underhanded tactics.

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:35.607 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Yeah, it definitely
seems a bit weird.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:39.152 position:50% align:center
She may be kind of wild,
but she doesn't play dirty.

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.153 position:50% align:center
[PHOBIO]
Regarding that...

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:41.196 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Uh?

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.490 position:50% align:center
When Demon Lord
Frey finally left.

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:45.075 position:50% align:center
She didn't go back home.

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:47.577 position:50% align:center
Nor was she travelling
toward Milim's domain.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.454 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]
Where'd she go?

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:51.206 position:50% align:center
Somewhere much worse.

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:53.500 position:50% align:center
Toward Demon Lord
Clayman's domain.

00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:54.542 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:57.545 position:50% align:center
[SUPHIA growls]
But that's madness!

00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:58.546 position:50% align:center
I have to go!

00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:59.964 position:50% align:center
Hold it, Suphia!

00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:00.965 position:50% align:center
[SUPHIA gasps]

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:02.342 position:50% align:center
You want revenge?

00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:04.344 position:50% align:center
Then the three of us
will go there together.

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:06.221 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Easy there, sluggers.

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:09.808 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] For what it's worth,
I think Demon Lord Carrion

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:11.309 position:50% align:center
is still alive.

00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:13.978 position:50% align:center
Milim has to be pissed that
their duel was interrupted.

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:16.106 position:50% align:center
There's something
more to all this.

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:17.524 position:50% align:center
So don't go flying
off the handle

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:19.401 position:50% align:center
and razing any cities just yet.

00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:21.695 position:50% align:center
We won't be able to help
anyone unless we figure this out

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:22.862 position:50% align:center
and work together.

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:23.863 position:50% align:center
As you wish.

00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:25.448 position:50% align:center
--Okay.
--All right.

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:26.991 position:50% align:center
[GRUCIUS grunts]

00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:29.911 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Is Demon Lord Clayman
the one pulling the strings?

00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:32.956 position:50% align:center
If that's true, then we could
very well be up against

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:35.875 position:50% align:center
three different Demon Lords.

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:42.632 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Well... There's still
a lot to figure out, huh?

00:14:42.716 --> 00:14:44.217 position:50% align:center
--[RANGA] Hmm?
--[RIMURU] What's up?

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:47.387 position:50% align:center
[BLACK] I see you've
awakened from your slumber.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:48.638 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad.

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:50.265 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Uh, yeah?

00:14:50.348 --> 00:14:52.183 position:50% align:center
[BLACK] I offer
my sincere congratulations

00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:54.894 position:50% align:center
on your successful
evolution to Demon Lord.

00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:56.187 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
For sure.

00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50% align:center
Who are you again?

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.690 position:50% align:center

Guh!

My... What a wicked
sense of humor...

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:06.906 position:50% align:center
I may be a demon, my lord,

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:10.243 position:50% align:center
but I assure you,
even I have feelings.

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:13.455 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Dude's got some
crazy strong demon vibes.

00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:15.874 position:50% align:center
But he is not ringing a bell.

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:17.584 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] He is one of
the demons that was summoned

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:20.754 position:50% align:center
when you consumed the souls of
the soldiers of Falmuth, Master.

00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:22.088 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Oh, duh!

00:15:22.172 --> 00:15:23.381 position:50% align:center
You still hangin' around?!

00:15:23.465 --> 00:15:26.301 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Uh. Yes, sir...?

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:28.803 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I heard you really
did me a solid back there!

00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:30.347 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot, bruh!

Ah! Please! It was my pleasure.

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:34.809 position:50% align:center
On that note, sir--

00:15:34.893 --> 00:15:36.895 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Sorry to keep you,
feel free to go!

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:38.646 position:50% align:center
It's whatever.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.066 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
It is "whatever"...?

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:42.233 position:50% align:center

Yep!

Please don't say such a thing!

00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:49.949 position:50% align:center
As I asked of you
at my summoning,

00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:52.786 position:50% align:center
I wish to serve as your most
humble servant, my lord!

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:55.413 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
You want to serve me?

00:15:55.497 --> 00:15:57.457 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] But this guy's
obviously a lot higher-ranked

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.043 position:50% align:center
than something like
a greater demon, right?

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:01.920 position:50% align:center
Is he that hard up for a job?

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:03.254 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Hey, Ranga.

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:06.091 position:50% align:center
Are you positive this is
the same demon I summoned?

00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:07.842 position:50% align:center
Without a doubt, sir.

00:16:07.926 --> 00:16:10.845 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I see... Well, okay.

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:12.555 position:50% align:center
You cool with working for free?

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:16.893 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Ah! Serving you is
all the payment I need.

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:18.561 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Sweet. It's a deal.

00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:22.023 position:50% align:center
Ah! I'm delighted,
my lord! Thank you.

00:16:22.107 --> 00:16:24.025 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Drop the whole
"my lord" thing, though.

00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:25.360 position:50% align:center
It creeps me out.

00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:27.946 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
Rimuru's fine with me.

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:30.198 position:50% align:center
Rimuru...

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:32.283 position:50% align:center
--What a beautiful ring it has!
--[RIMURU] Uhh...

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:34.953 position:50% align:center
I'm henceforth yours,
Great Rimuru.

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:36.955 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
So, you got a name, or...?

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:41.209 position:50% align:center
I have none. And I'm content
to remain anonymous.

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:43.128 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
That could get confusing.

00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:45.922 position:50% align:center
How 'bout I give you one
in place of payment.

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:47.841 position:50% align:center
What?! That's the
greatest reward I could

00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:50.176 position:50% align:center
ever hope to receive.

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:53.346 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Let's see...

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.641 position:50% align:center
You're a demon, so we should do
something fire and brimstone-y.

00:16:56.725 --> 00:16:59.769 position:50% align:center
I know! Your name is Diablo!

00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:01.479 position:50% align:center
[BLACK]
Diablo...

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:02.939 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] It straight-up
means "demon" and there

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:06.234 position:50% align:center
are sweet cars with that name.
I see no downsides.

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:08.361 position:50% align:center
Serve me well enough
to live up to the name.

00:17:08.445 --> 00:17:10.280 position:50% align:center
We'll get along fine.

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:12.490 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:21.416 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU groans] That took
about half of my magicules,

00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:24.502 position:50% align:center
but summoning the greater
demon Beretta took about 30%,

00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:26.880 position:50% align:center
so I guess that's
less than I expected.

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:28.214 position:50% align:center
--[RAPHAEL] Notice.
--[RIMURU] Uh?

00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:29.591 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Since you evolved,
your magicules have

00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:31.301 position:50% align:center
vastly increased.

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:33.803 position:50% align:center
For this reason, a fair
comparison cannot be made.

00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:35.555 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
How much more do I have now?

00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:37.098 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Ten times the previous amount.

00:17:37.182 --> 00:17:39.934 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps] I have
a feeling he's gonna evolve

00:17:40.018 --> 00:17:42.312 position:50% align:center
into a hell of a fiend.

00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:48.318 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU gasps]
He looks so strong!

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:51.196 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Diablo... That is my name.

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:53.281 position:50% align:center
My heart overflows
with gratitude.

00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:54.741 position:50% align:center
I thank you.

00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:56.242 position:50% align:center
From this day forward,

00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:58.953 position:50% align:center
I offer you my complete
and utter devotion.

00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:01.331 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Heh. I'll be counting on you.

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:05.710 position:50% align:center
Now. It seemed as though
something was troubling you.

00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:07.545 position:50% align:center
Please tell me if I can assist.

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:09.297 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Oh, it's no big deal.

00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:12.425 position:50% align:center
Okay, that's a lie.
It's about the future.

00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:13.927 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Go on.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:17.472 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] There are too many
problems happening at once.

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.766 position:50% align:center
The thing with Clayman...

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:23.478 position:50% align:center
The aftermath of
the Kingdom of Falmuth...

00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:25.563 position:50% align:center
And how to deal with
the Western Holy Church

00:18:25.647 --> 00:18:28.858 position:50% align:center
that views monsters
as enemies...

00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:30.276 position:50% align:center
Quite the dilemma.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.237 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Notice. I believe
there's no need to worry

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.197 position:50% align:center
about the Western Holy Church.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.782 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Why's that?

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:37.450 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Because the Appraisal
of the Unlimited Imprisonment

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:40.829 position:50% align:center
that seals the individual named
Veldora is nearly complete.

00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:42.539 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] What?!
So it's seriously possible

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:44.457 position:50% align:center
to free Veldora?!

00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:45.875 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Seriously.

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:47.585 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I thought that would
take hundreds of years!

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:49.546 position:50% align:center
You're amazing, Raphael!

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:52.465 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] If Veldora is
freed and able to fight,

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
that should be more
than enough to keep

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:56.261 position:50% align:center
the Western Nations in check.

00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:57.971 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
That's true. As a church,

00:18:58.054 --> 00:19:00.598 position:50% align:center
they can't afford to be careless
and anger a dragon.

00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:03.143 position:50% align:center
Also, you do speak
a lot more fluently now!

00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:04.894 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
No. It's your imagination.

00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:06.646 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Oh, forget it!

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:10.859 position:50% align:center
Huh. I think I'm starting to see
a way out of these problems now.

00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:13.361 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I can definitely
make this work.

00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:16.114 position:50% align:center
Oh? Have you come up with
a brilliant idea?

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:19.701 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I've decided to live up
to the title of Demon Lord!

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:22.412 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
Splendid, Lord Rimuru.

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:25.957 position:50% align:center
I, Diablo, swear my loyalty
to you for eternity.

00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:28.209 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Yes! On the subject of loyalty,

00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:31.588 position:50% align:center
I, Ranga, am also your
loyal servant, Master!

00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:34.132 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
I know, buddy.

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:35.425 position:50% align:center
[RANGA pants excitedly]

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:37.344 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO whines]

00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:40.889 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Now that that's settled,

00:19:40.972 --> 00:19:42.640 position:50% align:center
I'm going out for a bit.

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:45.769 position:50% align:center
Ranga, will you tell everyone
to start preparing a banquet?

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:46.853 position:50% align:center
Done!

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:48.188 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Souei, you there?

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:49.939 position:50% align:center
--Of course.
--[RIMURU] Get started--

00:19:50.023 --> 00:19:52.901 position:50% align:center
I will gather intel
on Clayman at once.

00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:55.612 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Wow. I didn't even
have to give the order.

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:58.948 position:50% align:center
Gotta love a dude who knows
how to get stuff done.

00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:01.159 position:50% align:center
Okay, I'm heading out.

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:04.371 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] After I evolved into
a Demon Lord, my ultimate skill,

00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:06.956 position:50% align:center
Raphael, presided
over all my other skills,

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.959 position:50% align:center
which made them
way easier to use.

00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:12.587 position:50% align:center
Gluttony seems to have
evolved into Beelzebub, too,

00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:15.090 position:50% align:center
so now I'm packing
two ultimate skills!

00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:17.509 position:50% align:center
Now that's what I call OP!

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.725 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
This place brings back memories.

00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:32.482 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] How have
two years already passed?

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:33.775 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Notice.

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:36.528 position:50% align:center
Appraisal of Unlimited
Imprisonment is complete.

00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:39.030 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] I can finally
fulfill my promise.

00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:40.657 position:50% align:center
I'll set you free now.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.492 position:50% align:center
Let's do this, Veldora.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.498 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
Huh? Am I... taller?

00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:53.378 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU groans] Raphael.
Make a double of my body.

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:55.547 position:50% align:center
That way Veldora can inhabit it.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.799 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL]
Activating Enhanced Body Double.

00:21:00.343 --> 00:21:04.472 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU] Huh? Dang.
I did mature a bit.

00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:07.225 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:11.354 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU]
If I do say so myself,

00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:13.523 position:50% align:center
I'm kind of a hottie.

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:17.444 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Ahem! Okay, task at hand.

00:21:38.673 --> 00:21:41.134 position:50% align:center
[RIMURU grunts]
Please work.

00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:46.765 position:50% align:center
[RAPHAEL] Notice.
Soul corridor between Master

00:21:46.848 --> 00:21:49.601 position:50% align:center
and the individual
named Veldora confirmed.

00:21:49.684 --> 00:21:51.061 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:08.036 position:50% align:center
[cackles]

00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:13.041 position:50% align:center
I am the Storm Dragon,
Veldora Tempest! Revived!

00:22:13.124 --> 00:22:14.459 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:18.171 position:50% align:center
And those who defy me
will be slaughtered!

00:22:18.254 --> 00:22:22.550 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
