1
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:12,137
Aide Summon!
No more messing around!

2
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,764
Isami Tahara!

3
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,350
I command you to
appear before me!

4
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:37,371
Huh? Well now, if it
isn't the chief.

5
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,498
Wait, where the hell are we?

6
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,960
[OONO]
Yeah, that's Tahara all right.

7
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,795
[clears throat]

8
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,089
I'm glad you're here, Tahara.

9
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,340
Let's go inside.

10
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,218
Find a good place where
we can sit down and talk.

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,136
Oh, sure.

12
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,242
[TAHARA]
I don't get it.

13
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,746
Is this the new <i>Infinity Game</i>
arena or something?

14
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:46,124
Looks like they blew tons
of money, as usual, huh.

15
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,125
Yeah, well.

16
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,503
I feel like there's
something I should mention.

17
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,796
You're no longer
in a world where

18
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,382
the Great Empire is
even known to exist.

19
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,133
Sorry, what?

20
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,430
What is it, then?

21
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:04,101
Seriously, you sayin' it's
some sort of fantasy world?

22
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,812
Like I'm in a damn
anime or something?

23
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,856
Yeah, to be blunt,
it's just like that.

24
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,400
Huh.

25
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,613
[OONO]
There it is.

26
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,574
Tahara's head is
churning away, I can tell.

27
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,952
He's coming up with a whole
slew of theories and ideas

28
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,871
about what's going
down right now.

29
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,541
Well, I know there's no way
that you're pranking me.

30
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,210
That kinda thing just
isn't your style.

31
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,212
[KUNAI]
So you know, Yu is here.

32
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,213
Gah!

33
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,923
That mad woman is here?

34
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,508
You're kidding me, right?

35
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,344
I'm gonna need you to
cooperate with her.

36
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,888
Sorry, did you happen
to drop your left arm?

37
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,015
Or perhaps, maybe, your right?

38
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,227
Both. I lost both,
it would appear.

39
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,521
Well, that seems like
quite the predicament!

40
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,899
But, tell you what, I'll do you
a little favor just for today.

41
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,235
[shrieks]

42
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,571
Oops, that's my bad.

43
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,782
It looks like I unfortunately
mixed up your arms.

44
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,242
Are you serious?

45
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:05,078
This is not a laughing matter!

46
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,459
[OONO] She's a pretty
one, but damn scary.

47
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,587
Why'd I decide to program
her that way, anyway?

48
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:17,048
[TAHARA] Hey, Chief. You mind
if I clear something up?

49
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,175
Sure, what is it?

50
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,260
What you said before
about the Great Empire‐‐

51
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,180
Are you serious about it
not existing in this world?

52
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:26,183
There's no doubt in
my mind, not even one.

53
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,893
[sighs] Well, let me tell you,

54
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,562
if this truly is a world
without the Great Empire,

55
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,231
I really couldn't
be any happier.

56
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,400
One more question for you.

57
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,986
What exactly do you
plan to do in this place?

58
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,031
Sorry, but I can't say much
about it at this point.

59
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,240
Although,

60
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,451
I will admit, I'm seriously
considering heading

61
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,995
in the opposite direction
of the Great Empire.

62
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,288
Yeah?

63
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,956
Well, whatever.

64
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,541
Bottom line, if it
weren't for you,

65
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,503
I know Manami and I
would've died like dogs.

66
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,880
[OONO] Ah, yes, Manami.
The little sister

67
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,716
Tahara's always been so
fiercely protective of.

68
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:00,675
[MANAMI]
Big Brother!

69
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,593
[TAHARA]
Manami!

70
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:02,761
[MANAMI]
Big Brother!

71
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:03,887
[TAHARA]
Manami!

72
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:04,971
[MANAMI]
Big Brother!

73
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,973
[TAHARA]
Manami!

74
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,976
So do we have a plan of action
for the time being, Chief?

75
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,230
Well, first, we have to manage
this dirt‐poor village.

76
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,689
And we've got our
work cut out for us

77
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,191
because its only three draws are

78
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,027
a hospital, hot springs,
and a bath house.

79
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,738
You'll need to do things that'll
continue developing the area,

80
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,406
like job training
for the residents,

81
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,076
overseeing the new businesses,
managing any trouble,

82
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:29,538
negotiating with nobles,
developing a childcare program.

83
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,664
Uh, what else?

84
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,123
Are you being serious?

85
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,001
I'm one man. I'm not
some freakin' robot!

86
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,463
Yeah, but you're a damn genius.
I know you can do this.

87
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:42,175
Come on, it's me talking,
so you know it's true.

88
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,094
[TAHARA gasps]

89
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,804
Hey, you okay?

90
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,557
It‐‐It felt like
I'd been zapped!

91
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,433
What the hell's going on?

92
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,352
[KUNAI] You think
something's wrong with you?

93
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:53,854
Have Yu take a look.

94
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,188
[TAHARA]
Yeah, no thanks!

95
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,940
The day I let that
psycho touch me

96
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,526
is the day I end up in
little bitty pieces!

97
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,862
[YU] Come now,
that's not nice, Tahara.

98
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,614
Huh? Gah!

99
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,949
The mad woman!

100
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,742
Oh, I mean, hello again!

101
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,994
How nice to see you!

102
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,788
Long time no see. What a treat.

103
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,917
Demon Lord, who's this
new person with you?

104
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,004
I won't lie, he looks like
a big pervert to me.

105
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,424
[LUNA] Are you one of
the Demon Lord's lackeys?

106
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,302
Such a pretty color.
You must be very kind.

107
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,929
Don't know if I'd say that.

108
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:28,889
[OONO]
Now, then.

109
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,350
All that's left are the
preparations to welcome Madam.

110
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:42,986
[music playing]

111
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,868
[MANNEN] My goodness. What kind
of magical device is this?

112
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,287
Hey, don't get too
excited quite yet.

113
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,832
Look, it even has a second
key for you to wind up.

114
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,627
[MANNEN]
Hmm. I'm just curious.

115
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:02,088
Is this another item
of yours from overseas?

116
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,757
[KUNAI]
Yes, that's right.

117
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,426
In my country, letting this
play on cold winter nights

118
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,094
while sipping on some nice wine

119
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,640
is a common practice for
the more refined folks.

120
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,559
It doesn't get any
better than that, really.

121
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,520
Well, I must say,
it truly is a masterpiece.

122
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,066
It's hard to believe‐‐the fact
that it's so easy, I mean.

123
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,277
Who knew you could enjoy music
without even a musician?

124
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,279
[KUNAI] Well for balls
and high society stuff,

125
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,740
of course, you'd
still need those.

126
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,284
However, if you're
all alone in your room

127
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,828
or maybe hosting a small,
informal group of people,

128
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,791
this is much less invasive and
by far the smarter choice.

129
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:41,503
Also, it's a lot more convenient
to carry around with you.

130
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,797
It's not the most practical
idea to march around

131
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,257
with an orchestra
trailing behind you.

132
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,343
So, what would an item like this

133
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,220
be valued at back
where you're from?

134
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,180
[KUNAI] If you don't mind,
I'd actually prefer

135
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,599
if you determined the value
this time, Mr. Mannen.

136
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,475
Whaddya say?

137
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,393
[gasps]

138
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,310
[MANNEN]
Oh, no.

139
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,104
I'm not even sure
how to begin judging

140
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,898
the value of this truly
marvelous device!

141
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,108
If I price it too low,

142
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,903
then I may end up losing
his business altogether!

143
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,905
[MANNEN] In your country,
I imagine this must be

144
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,116
a pretty expensive
item, am I right?

145
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,284
Well, that depends,
because, typically,

146
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,621
when it comes to valuing art
and other items of this nature,

147
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,456
their worth can be
very subjective,

148
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,084
not unlike the whole "beauty
is in the eye of the beholder"

149
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,210
thing, you know?

150
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,586
[MANNEN]
Shoot! I knew it.

151
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,006
That means he's
testing me, right?

152
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,966
[MANNEN]
If I'm being perfectly honest,

153
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,010
when you first offered me
this item for auction,

154
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,221
I couldn't even begin to imagine
how much it must be worth.

155
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,141
I've never seen
anything quite like it!

156
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,978
[KUNAI] So, you're saying you
believe it has tremendous value?

157
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,022
[MANNEN]
Are you kidding? Of course I do!

158
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,940
There are plenty of people
who would be interested

159
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,734
in a magical item like this.

160
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,402
You just have to know
where to find them.

161
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,445
[KUNAI]
Good to know.

162
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,114
In that case, what's the least
you think it might sell for

163
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,741
if it were to go up for auction?

164
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,534
Just give me your best guess.

165
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,286
[MANNEN]
It's time! I feel it!

166
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,289
This is the moment when
he'll make his decision!

167
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,791
If I screw up now,
then I bet Mr. Kunai

168
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:05,045
will take his device to
some other store owner.

169
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,297
I'll lose out on
more than just this.

170
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,049
He'll end up taking all
of his future business

171
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,759
to someone else, too!

172
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,720
[MANNEN] If it were me,
I'd start at no less than

173
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,346
15 gold coins.

174
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,806
Someone who can't
afford that much

175
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,975
has no business at
an auction, anyway.

176
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,562
And it's a waste of time to
start any lower than that.

177
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,856
[KUNAI] You have a
remarkably discerning eye.

178
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,692
I was right to put my
faith in you, my friend.

179
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,532
[BINGO] Oh! Mr. Kunai!
We're so excited to have you!

180
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,035
Give him a Bingo
welcome, ladies!

181
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,037
[WOMEN]
Welcome to our shop, sir!

182
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,789
Thanks.

183
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,583
So, I'm going to need
some outfits made.

184
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:47,003
We're looking at 20 of each.
Does that sound doable?

185
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,506
One moment, please,
while I look.

186
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,802
[BINGO] Let's see,
the tuxedos on their own

187
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,345
shouldn't be too big of a deal,

188
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,515
but is he really serious
about making these

189
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,141
suits and tights for women?

190
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,352
What a tantalizing
design choice!

191
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,771
I mean, who does stitched
tights like this?

192
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,857
Seriously! No one, that's who!

193
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,568
Sure, we'll be able to
make these with no problem.

194
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,694
That's great news.

195
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:12,737
Just so you understand,

196
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,406
I'm going to need them done
as quickly as possible.

197
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,866
And as soon as you
finish them up,

198
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:20,203
it's important that they're sent
directly to Rabby Village.

199
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,247
I do understand wanting
them done quickly,

200
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,874
but I'm afraid these will
take some time to make.

201
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,252
[KUNAI] I'm prepared to
compensate you handsomely

202
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,419
for the extra rush.

203
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,839
[ALL gasp]

204
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,424
[KUNAI] And of course, this is
only the first installment.

205
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,843
If you complete
the work quickly,

206
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,554
I can even add another
two to that total.

207
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,847
Can you do it?

208
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,390
I hope the answer is yes!

209
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,559
'Course we can! I swear!

210
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,104
We'll work day and night until
every last stitch is complete.

211
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,647
That's very good to hear.

212
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,358
I'd ask that you begin
work at once, in that case.

213
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,944
[BINGO]
Everyone! It's time for battle!

214
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:53,903
Go on! Get started!

215
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,196
[WOMEN]
Right!

216
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,410
[WORKERS]
Thank you, Mister Demon Lord!

217
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:06,875
[OONO] Bread, milk, vegetables,
meat, and eggs. Good.

218
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,751
Now food will get delivered
directly to Rabby

219
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,045
every so often,
which is what I wanted.

220
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,714
The expenses
definitely added up,

221
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,883
but I've still got three
gold coins left over

222
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:18,261
after all of this. We should
easily be able to manage things

223
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,513
for a while on that much.

224
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,266
So, everything's more
or less ready now.

225
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,951
[OONO] It's funny how different
I feel about these two avatars.

226
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,454
Like, Kunai's the
house I grew up in,

227
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,498
and Zero's the room I
rented when I moved out.

228
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,167
Looking back,
I'm remembering how much

229
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,920
I used him during the
heyday of the game.

230

When it comes down to it,

we've been partners
for about ten years.

[OONO] What's this feeling
swelling up from deep inside?

233
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:08,061
That persistent urge to crush
the strong and help the weak.

234
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,064
To face my opponents
no matter who they are.

235
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:15,985
That fierce desire to be a hero
which simply won't be denied.

236
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,029
It's as if he's really a‐‐

00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,804
died and gone
directly up to heaven.

311
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:14,474
I have to admit, everything
you've shown me thus far

312
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,934
has truly lived up to your word.

313
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,020
[KUNAI]
It's this, right here.

314
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,313
Some soap?

315
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,941
[LUNA] Oh! That soap is
seriously the best thing, ever!

316
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,277
It washes away dirt like
magic and leaves your skin

317
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,613
so clean it sparkles!

318
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:33,326
[SHRIMPFRY]
Magic. Sparkling, huh?

319
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,244
[OONO]
That soap was a real hit!

320
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:39,707
[SAMBO] Oh? So, this the village
you were talking about, Madam?

321
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,754
[SHRIMPFRY]
Hold it right there, Gramps.

322
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,838
[SAMBO]
Hmm?

323
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,549
I told you to wait
till I called for you.

324
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:52,303
Well, you see, old folks like
me don't really like waiting.

325
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,473
Madam, might I ask
who this gentleman is?

326
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,516
If you must know,

327
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,977
this old fool causing nothing
but trouble is Commander Sambo.

328
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,147
As you can tell,
he doesn't see very well.

329
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,399
I only brought him along
to show him a good time

330
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,026
since the general
assumption is that

331
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,529
he doesn't have many years left.

332
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,823
You know, your mouth is just
as poisonous as ever, Madam.

333
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,576
Don't you think you should
show your elders more respect?

334
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,328
Speaking of mouths, hush.

335
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,829
I'm sorry, sir.

336
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,541
It sounds as if your
condition is quite serious.

337
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,794
But perhaps we might be able
to do something to help you.

338
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:28,297
Oh, I guess you must be the man
that Madam was talking about.

339
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,508
As she said,
I'm Commander Sambo,

340
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,010
former retainer to Head
Soldier Marshall Arts.

341
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,429
[OONO]
Arts? Who was that again?

342
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,765
Oh? The renowned
Master Arts, you mean?

343
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,893
This'll be fun. I can imagine
the tales of your exploits

344
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,770
are great and plentiful.

345
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,606
[SAMBO grunts]
Yes, but several years ago,

346
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:49,110
a magical beast unfortunately
took both my eyes.

347
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,778
I decided to go ahead and retire

348
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,364
because I'm not much
use to anyone anymore.

349
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,616
It must've been
really tough for you.

350
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:56,742
It just so happens,

351
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,537
one of the folks on my team
is an exceptional doctor.

352
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,915
I'd be surprised if she couldn't
heal your eyes altogether.

353
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:06,210
[gasps] You're not
jerking my chain, right?

354
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,838
If you'd like, I'll take
you to her right now.

355
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,424
[SAMBO] Please do! Even if
there's only a slim chance,

356
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,385
this is more hope than
I've felt in a long time!

357
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,971
Goodness, you're being
a bothersome old man.

358
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,431
I'm very sorry about this.

359
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,142
We definitely didn't mean
to make more work for you.

360
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,811
It's no problem in
the slightest, Madam.

361
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,731
Go ahead, Tahara,
you can take him inside.

362
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,608
[TAHARA]
This way, Master Sambo.

363
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,817
[SAMBO]
Thank you.

364
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:31,777
[KUNAI]
Yu.

365
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,487
[YU]
Yep, on it, Chief.

366
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,374
Hello, welcome to you both.

367
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,376
I'm glad to have you here.

368
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,462
[SHRIMPFRY]
Look at this place.

369
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,840
It feels like I've stumbled into
another world or something.

370
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,344
Go on, Gramps.

371
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,512
Won't you just have her
take a look already?

372
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,348
Would you back off,
you meddling woman?

373
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,433
I'm not likely to run
away from her, am I?

374
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,478
Then get on with it,
you senile old man!

375
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,898
[YU] Master Sambo, are you
ready to begin the examination?

376
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,486
[SAMBO] I'd like to
say I'm sorry, first,

377
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,905
for exposing you to
this awful thing.

378
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,115
It's the venom of a Scarecrow.

379
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,825
That's what did this to me.

380
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:20,868
[YU]
Okay.

381
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,579
[SAMBO] These days, I can only
see the outline of a person,

382
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,414
and that's on a really good day.

383
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,875
I can't tell you
how grateful I'd be

384
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,293
if you could make it any better.

385
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,212
Please, rest assured.

386
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,463
In the country I came from,

387
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,423
we have a medicine that
treats your symptoms

388
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,676
and I think you're a
perfect candidate.

389
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,804
[SAMBO gasps] My goodness,
you're really serious?

390
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,348
Yes, please wait a moment.

391
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,146
[KUNAI] Interesting,
she plans to cure him

392
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,148
simply through medicine.

393
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,359
Now that I think about it,
she's probably right.

394
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:56,862
It'd be a bit much to expose
them to Yu's Hand of God.

395
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,248
All right, please look up.

396
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,709
[SAMBO]
Like this?

397
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,751
[SAMBO gasps]

398
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,131
There you go.

399
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,175
Now, I want you to
open your eyes real slow.

400
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,222
[gasping]

401
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,932
I can see everything!

402
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:28,769
You did it! My eyes are
totally back to normal!

403
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,397
Gramps, are you completely sure?

404
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,773
Oh, Madam!

405
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,317
You've fattened up a bit
since the last time I saw you!

406
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,903
What have you been eating
to get yourself that big?

407
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,865
[SHRIMPFRY] Would you kindly
shut up, you walking corpse?

408
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,744
[SAMBO cries]

409
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,788
I can hardly believe it!
Thank you so much.

410
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,873
Now that you're healed,

411
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,459
you can go back to
your old post again.

412
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,878
I'm sure Arts would be
delighted to see you.

413
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,712
[SAMBO]
That's right!

414
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:59,091
Lord Arts, your loyal Sambo
is coming back to serve you!

415
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:05,723
Ah! I'm so sorry for having
caused such a big ruckus.

416
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,934
I'll be happy to pay for
all the damages, of course.

417
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,186
[YU]
This is...

418
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,688
It's a holy lambda coin!

419
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,733
Its value depends on the market,
but I've heard they're worth

420
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:19,195
a hundred giant gold
coins at the very least.

421
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,616
So, you're sure?

422
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,117
Of course, it's fine!

423
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,036
That stubborn old blockhead
is indebted to me

424
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,747
thanks to you and your medicine,
and that's worth a lot.

425
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:30,623
Truly.

426
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,167
So much more than any number
of holy lambda coins,

427
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,085
that's for certain.

428
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,421
Well, if you insist.

429
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,423
You know, I have a strong
feeling that you and I

430
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,342
are going to become
great friends.

431
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:45,012
What a coincidence!
I think so, too.

432
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:50,226
[BOTH chuckling]

433
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,270
[chuckles]

434
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,322
[KUNAI]
Tell me, Tahara.

435
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,615
How are you feeling about

436
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,492
not being able to see
your little sister here?

437
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:35,873
[TAHARA crying]
Manami... Manami!

438
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:36,707
[KUNAI]
Uh...

439
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:37,791
[TAHARA]
It's fine!

440
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,377
With us running a business
like we're in the yakuza,

441
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,339
it's really a lot better
that she's not around!

442
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,549
[OONO sighs] You're always
such a nervous Nellie

443
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:46,967
when it comes to your sister.

444
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,303
[AKU] Demon Lord,
what's a nervous Nellie?
