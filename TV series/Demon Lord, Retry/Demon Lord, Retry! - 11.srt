[AKU snoring]

2
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:25,817
My skin is so smooth
after the hot springs.

3
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,278
Smooth hot springs skin.

4
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,910
My butt is so soft.
Soft and smooth!

5
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,580
[OONO]
Finally!

6
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:41,750
It's been so crazy lately, I
haven't had a minute to breathe.

7
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:45,087
I shoulda left a note and
busted out of there forever ago.

8
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,630
‐‐[WOMAN 11A] Look at that!
‐‐Oh, my gosh!

9
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,882
He's even more handsome
than I thought!

10
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:56,682
So, I had another one of
those dreams last night.

11
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,475
You know, that hot old man.

12
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,102
Seriously? Again?

13
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,895
I'm never sure what to
say when you tell me that,

14
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:05,190
so I'll just focus on
keeping a blank face.

15
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,859
[YUKIKAZE]
I mean, even after I wake up,

16
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,571
my entire down‐below
is still on fire!

17
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,114
Would you please gimme a break?

18
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,783
It's way too early in
the day for this crap.

19

[MIKAN]
Huh? Hey, wait! Yukikaze!

22
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,458
[YUKIKAZE]
Old man!

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,459
[KUNAI]
Hm?

24
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:28,630
[panting]

25
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,716
At last, we meet again!

26
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,816
So, hi!

27
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,110
No way, now we're
running into him?

28
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,444
This is a little weird!

29
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:18,031
Oh, hello, it's been a while.

30
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,367
[OONO] I hope that was
a convincing cover,

31
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,494
cuz if I'm s'posed to know
what these girls' names are,

32
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,995
I'm in trouble.

33
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,707
I mean, it's been so chaotic
lately that it's understandable,

34
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,958
I guess, but,

35
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,209
it kinda makes
me wish this world

36
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,503
used name tags or something.

37
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,507
[OONO]
Huh. There's a thought.

38
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,093
Name tags aren't
a bad idea at all.

39
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,303
And it might be lucrative
little business for Rabby,

40
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,304
which could be cool,

41
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,391
considering all they're
known for now is carrots.

42
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,394
So, tell us, handsome.
Where've you been lately?

43
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:50,188
[KUNAI]
Hmm? Uh.

44
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,858
Well, I've basically set
up base in Rabby Village,

45
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,026
and we're working to revamp it.

46
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,820
Oh, so it's true.

47
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,406
I'd heard that, but I
thought it was too weird.

48
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,742
Then what brings you
here to the capital?

49
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,785
[KUNAI] I need to ask
the Adventurers' Guild

50
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,036
about a couple of things.

51
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,914
[YUKIKAZE] Wait, the Guild?
What is it you need to know?

52
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:11,084
[KUNAI] Uh, it's regarding
the dungeons up in the north.

53
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,253
[OONO] I actually want
to ask about what items

54
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:16,298
ward against magic,
but that's awkward.

55
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,257
[YUKIKAZE]
I hate to tell you,

56
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,426
but the Guild won't be able
to help much with things

57
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,511
outside the country.

58
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:24,014
But Yukikaze can teach you
what you need to know!

59
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,725
Hey, Mcflirty‐pants, you wanna
stop flapping your jaws

60
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,143
willy‐nilly seeing as
you're chatting with

61
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,519
the freakin' Demon Lord?

62
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,605
Know what you should do, Mikan?

63
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,023
Go home and rethink
your choices,

64
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,150
including that outfit,
Miss Loin Cloth.

65
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,318
Are you kidding me?

66
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,278
Care to talk about that
wanna‐be witchy hat

67
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,404
you've got going on
up there because...

68
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:43,158
[OONO] Okay. So, I guess these
two are Mikan and Yukikaze.

69
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,910
That shouldn't be
hard to remember,

70
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,330
but let's give 'em one of those
couple‐mashup‐nicknames, anyway.

71
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,915
Yukimikan!

72
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,250
[YUKIKAZE sighs]
Anyways, old man.

73
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,086
There's a favorite place
of mine pretty close by.

74
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,507
I'd really love to treat
you, for all you've done.

75
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,176
I believe I told you before.

76
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,179
There's no need to
pay me back for that.

77
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:10,101
Yes. You said that you
had your own reasons.

78
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,853
That's right, I did.

79
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,691
[OONO] Her skin really is
like porcelain, isn't it?

80
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:22,447
It makes her seem mystical and,
I dunno, ethereal or something!

81
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,366
It may not be lunchtime yet,

82
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,284
but we could at
least get a drink!

83
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,912
Oh, a drink, huh?

84
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:33,625
[OONO sighs] It's been a
while since I craved a drink.

85
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,168
It's probably helped
that I've hardly had

86
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,170
a moment to myself, lately.

87
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,673
Come on, this way!

88
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,800
I'll just follow
you from behind.

89
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,009
We aren't in kindergarten,

90
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:46,555
we don't need to hold
hands to stay together.

91
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,307
[YUKIKAZE] Please. If you
don't, I'll get lost.

92
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,520
[OONO] Seriously? Man,
that was a close one.

93
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,982
I definitely almost
said that very out loud.

94
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,068
[OONO] So, I'm supposed to
believe that while she looks

95
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,237
like the kind of girl who
spends all day in the library,

96
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,781
she's actually a
big ol' airhead?

97
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,617
Mikan, lead the way.

98
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,287
[MIKAN sighs] Fine then,
it's easier than arguing.

99
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,913
Come on, I'll take you.

100
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,832
This day freakin' sucks.

101
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,459
[OONO] I'm getting a strong
sense that this Mikan person

102
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,629
isn't exactly a
huge fan of mine.

103
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,172
Then again, walking
around with a name

104
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,466
like Demon Lord
probably doesn't inspire

105
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,594
a lot of love, but it's fine.

106
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,845
I just need to put up with it

107
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,015
until business in Rabby
Village finally takes off.

108
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,474
Maze of affection.

109
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,685
A labyrinth of love in my heart.

110
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,314
[OONO] Please, no,
what is she talking about?

111
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,859
Bar keep! We need three ales!

112
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,861
And we brought you
a new customer!

113
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,155
Look at that! Mikan's back!

114
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:49,451
It's not often you bring
along someone besides... Huh?

115
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,994
[OONO]
Uh‐oh, what's up?

116
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,787
Does she know me from somewhere?

117
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,749
I wonder if she got caught up
in all the chaos the other day.

118
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,209
You brought the Demon Lord
everyone's been talking about!

119
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,294
This is exciting!

120
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,172
Oh, is that really you?
In that case, come sit with us!

121
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,673
I'll buy the next round!

122
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,550
Wait, what? Who is this guy?

123
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,010
Are you kidding me? You idiot!

124
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,180
He's the one who blew
Carnival into smithereens!

125
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,598
[CUSTOMER 11B]
Go grab the rest of the bloakes!

126
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,642
They need to see this!

127
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,148
Hey, old man. I got us a table!

128
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,987
[IEI]
Here we go, thanks for waiting!

129
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,739
I want you to know,
every shop in the area

130
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,866
is grateful for
what you've done.

131
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,618
Your drinks are all
on the house today,

132
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:36,122
so you might as well
enjoy it! [laughs]

133
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,248
[OONO]
Well, in that case,

134
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,626
I see no reason why I
shouldn't start drinking.

135
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,253
I mean, we can do the
talking afterwards.

136
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,546
[KUNAI gasps]

137
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,258
Wait, what are you doing?

138
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,552
What do you mean?
I'm helping you drink.

139
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,764
[OONO] Time out, is this some
kind of shady hostess bar?

140
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,975
First of all, who needs
someone to help them drink?

141
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,811
If I'm that drunk already,
I don't even belong here!

142
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,981
Second of all, ew!
That's creepy as hell!

143
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:04,693
Forgive me, but I'd really
rather drink on my own.

144
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,778
Well, had to try.

145
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,659
This is so good!

146
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,120
[OONO]
Oh, man! This is the best!

147
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,080
It makes all that hard
work these past few days

148
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,373
seem totally worth it!

149
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,000
U‐Uh‐‐

150
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,626
[OONO]
Okay, why is she drinking my ale

151
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,837
when she clearly
has one of her own?

152
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,797
Ahh. It went so deep.

153
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,507
All the way down my throat.

154
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,718
[KUNAI] Could you not
say things like that?

155
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,803
[OONO] Jeez, everything
that comes out of her mouth

156
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,014
is completely ridiculous.

157
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,849
[YUKIKAZE]
Indirect kiss.

158
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,976
Tastes bubbilicious!

159
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:41,521
Look, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
need you to use real words.

160
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:45,984
[IEI laughs] Yukikaze sure
never changes, does she?

161
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,903
Here. Thought you might
like something to munch on.

162
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,114
Oh, nice! Let's see, here.

163
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,660
It's so normal!

164
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,037
"Normal"? That's it?

165
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,622
You can do better than that,
considering it's all free!

166
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,208
Sorry. I didn't
mean any offense.

167
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,002
I tried something
similar in Yahoo

168
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,628
and it wasn't very good at all.

169
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,256
So, this was a pleasant
surprise, I guess.

170
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,216
Oh, now I see what you meant.

171
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,135
You made the mistake
of assuming that place

172
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:16,264
could ever be compared
to this one! [laughs]

173
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,308
[OONO] I'm starting to get
the sense that this bar owner

174
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,935
is pretty damn good
at what she does.

175
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,145
[KUNAI gasps]

176
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,647
[OONO] Does this girl only
eat food that other people

177
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:25,899
have already put
in their mouths?

178
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,443
[gasps] His old man
lips have touched this,

179
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,612
and it tastes so yummy!

180
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,073
[KUNAI] Didn't I tell you
to quit saying weird stuff?

181
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,241
Ah, you'll find
it's the only way

182
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,035
Yukikaze knows how to roll.

183
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,453
Just give it up.

184
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,288
[YUKIKAZE gasps]

185
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,917
[OONO] Hold on, could
it be she's not actually

186
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,212
a total airhead, but,
in fact, a huge pervert?

187
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,547
I need to do something before
this gets any more wrong.

188
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,925
Oh, yes!

189
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,428
So, if you don't mind, I'm
gonna get right to the point.

190
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,721
[MIKAN]
Mmm?

191
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,113
[KUNAI] The truth is,
I could really use your help.

192
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,990
Tell me about the adventurer
system around here.

193
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,409
[MIKAN] I can't believe
I'm sitting here

194
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,703
chatting with the Demon Lord.

195
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,747
But considering he's
saved our butts twice now,

196
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,208
I guess I don't
have much choice.

197
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,751
I'm not sure exactly
what to tell you

198
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,795
about the adventurer system.

199
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:32,298
I mean, we fight monsters,
earn rewards, and, I dunno.

200
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,010
I guess find lost treasure
in ruins and dungeons?

201
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,265
The guild accepts lots
of various requests

202
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,433
which they pass along
to adventurers,

203
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,769
and then they get
paid a finder's fee.

204
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:45,979
[MIKAN]
Oh, right.

205
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,274
Another thing adventurers do is
take body parts off of monsters

206
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,817
and sell them to the guild.

207
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:54,154
The cleaner the specific
piece is, the better the price.

208
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,323
Also, all adventurers
are given official ranks.

209
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,659
[MIKAN]
Yeah. And the higher your rank,

210
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:02,996
the better your working terms
are and better they treat you.

211
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,540
So, guilds with skilled
and experienced adventurers

212
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,667
tend to make out like bandits.

213
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:11,004
That's why the guilds
always compete for them.

214
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:14,174
[OONO] That seems pretty similar
to professional sports players.

215
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,092
If you're good enough,
teams scout you hard

216
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,636
and try to entice you by
offering tons of money.

217
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,847
The best players have their
pick of whichever team

218
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,765
throws the most money at them.

219
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,434
[YUKIKAZE sighs]
But when money is tight,

220
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,477
some folks pick up
mercenary work.

221
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,897
Mercenaries, huh?

222
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,648
[OONO] So, for those
not skilled enough,

223
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,526
you pretty much do
whatever it takes to get by.

224
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:38,114
In that way, this world isn't
so very different from mine.

225
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:42,785
Even in dungeons, sometimes
monsters are hard to come by.

226
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,245
[KUNAI] Well, it certainly
doesn't sound like

227
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,331
a job with much security.

228
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,249
[OONO] It's not like
they work in an office.

229
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,627
They can't count on a
monthly salary, or benefits,

230
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,588
or any kind of bonus, ever.

231
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,506
They're basically
self‐employed workers

232
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,801
who voluntarily put
their lives on the line.

233
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,261
In wartime, like right now,

234
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,347
some find themselves
without anything to do.

235
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,349
So, times are tough?

236
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,600
Yeah, I'd say so.

237
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,853
It's much harder to get
into the northern countries.

238
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,272
There are spies and
agents everywhere.

239
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,440
From the way you talk,

240
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,109
I take it there are times
of peace, too, right?

241
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,736
[YUKIKAZE]
Mm.

242
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,405
The warring has actually
been going on for a while,

243
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,450
but there's profit to be made if
they can keep dragging it out.

244
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,035
[OONO]
If there's a war all year,

245
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,037
trade and crops
might not recover,

246
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,997
and that's the
best case scenario.

247
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,750
I feel sure it would end
everyone in no time.

248
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,586
I got more out of this
than I was expecting to.

249
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,213
Thank you so much.

250
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,297
As long as it's you,

251
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,425
I'll tell you anything
you want to know!

252
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,385
[KUNAI gasps]

253
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,930
[OONO] Ah, is it me, or is
this a body boundary issue?

254
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,182
This feels like the
wrong kind of friendly.

255
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,517
Ahem!

256
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,601
So, I've been wondering.

257
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,895
What sorts of things do
people usually discover

258
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,563
in the dungeons, anyway?

259
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,316
Um, it could really be anything.

260
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,902
Weapons and armor are
probably the most common.

261
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:02,198
As far as those go, there are
five different categories.

262
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,034
So, anything made from your
basic metal and leather

263
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,495
are simply referred
to as "Normal."

264
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,205
[YUKIKAZE] Whereas "Solid"
items are made from

265
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,251
monster fangs, pelts, scales,
and other fun things like that.

266
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,294
[MIKAN]
But unless you're skilled,

267
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,212
those are pretty tough to make.

268
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,964
Then, of course, you've
got "High End" items,

269
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,883
which are made with special
materials or rare metals.

270
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:25,513
Only Dwarves can build those.
It's impossible for a human.

271
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,974
[YUKIKAZE] The next one I don't
know a whole bunch about,

272
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:28,975
but there are "Uniques"

273
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,437
that only a handful of
S‐Rank adventurers wield.

274
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,481
[MIKAN] Finally, there are
items called "Legendaries."

275
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:39,277
That's what the Holy Maidens'
hammer and staves are.

276
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,487
[OONO]
Wow.

277
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,450
I guess, as messed up as she is,
she's still a Holy Maiden.

278
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,662
[YUKIKAZE] We try to find
unidentified items, too,

279
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,497
and you can name them yourself!

280
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,500
[KUNAI] Oh? That actually
sounds pretty intriguing.

281
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,045
We should really start
brainstorming names

282
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,463
for our precious little baby.

283
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,506
We're not newlyweds!

284
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,760
[OONO]
Gah! I couldn't help myself!

285
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,761
It's no use!

286
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,263
She freaks me out and knocks
me completely off balance,

287
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,058
and I do not mean
that in a good way!

288
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,726
Then again, they're
both teaching me

289
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,394
a lot of useful stuff.

290
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,856
There's just one more thing
I need to make sure of.

291
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,692
Tell me this: is it possible
to find any decent items

292
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,194
sold in shops?

293
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,113
Those items that are carried
all over are mass produced.

294
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,491
They aren't usually
good quality.

295
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,867
[KUNAI]
Couldn't you get better items

296
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,244
as long as you have
the money, though?

297
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,580
Like armor that
defends against magic?

298
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,333
Or swords strong enough
to slice through scales?

299
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,877
To defend against level
four and five magic,

300
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,837
it needs to be Unique level.

301
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,381
But why would you need that?

302
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,634
I bet a weapon of yours could
take down any opponent!

303
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,177
Huh.

304
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,346
[OONO] Interesting,
but I need to go confirm

305
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,224
all this information
with my own eyes.

306
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,185
Fortunately, most of the village
preparations are complete,

307
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,021
and Tahara can easily
take care of what's left.

308
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,274
[OONO] Honestly,
leaving everything to him

309
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,528
will most likely produce
better results, anyway.

310
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,279
[sneezes]

311
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,119
[KUNAI]
The north, huh?

312
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,122
Well. I think I'll
have to go there, myself.

313
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,749
[YUKIKAZE gasps] Hey, listen.
If you're going north,

314
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,377
then I really want you
to take me with you!

315
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,255
[MIKAN coughing]

316
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,756
Take you?

317
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,678
Despite how I look,
I'm a B‐Rank adventurer.

318
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,555
I'd be helpful.

319
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,890
[OONO] It's true, I could
definitely use some guidance

320
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,436
from someone who's had legit
experience in this world.

321
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,438
Yu and Tahara are
busy with the village,

322
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,565
so they can't come,
and bringing the kids along

323
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,442
is totally out of the question.

324
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:46,696
Plus, Tron might be persecuted
if she tries to leave Rabby!

325
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,865
[KUNAI] All right, then,
if it really isn't any trouble,

326
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,451
I think I will
take you up on that.

327
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,326
As with anything,

328
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,455
I should learn from those
who have experience.

329
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,206
[gasps]

330
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:01,085
Just leave it to me.
You won't regret it!

331
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,504
[OONO groans]
Man, she's the weirdest thing,

332
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,423
but sometimes I
really am struck by

333
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,842
what a beautiful
little person she is.

334
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,178
With my tough demeanor
and her sweet persona,

335
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:14,056
I feel like there's no way
anyone will give us a hard time.

336
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,434
Act now, and I'll throw
in Mikan as an extra.

337
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,853
Don't randomly add
me to your party!

338
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,355
And who the hell are
you calling "extra"?

339
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,816
Aw. I was counting on you, too.

340
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,026
Well, don't count on me!

341
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,737
You guys can go all
the way by yourselves!

342
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,739
[YUKIKAZE]
You said "go all the way."

343
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,866
Mikan, you're such
a naughty girl!

344
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:35,536
[MIKAN] Argh! Will you
ever just shut up?

345
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,045
[WHITE] I cannot put this
off a moment longer.

346
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,671
Hear me, Seraph.

347
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,798
I must take the Omega Staff.

348
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,635
That beautiful, sacred object.

349
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,970
Oh, please, forgive me.

350
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,184
[WHITE]
I need one of the miracles

351
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,436
the Omega Staff makes possible.

352
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,814
Instant Movement within
the Kingdom of Holy Light.

353
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,859
All the magic in this
staff will be consumed

354
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:10,321
and used to bolster
my magical power.

355
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,490
With the magic circle
in this room,

356
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,451
the miracle can,
at last, be employed.

357
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:19,038
Oh, Seraph, please
give me power.

358
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,124
[WHITE]
I must rescue her.

359
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,918
Not just because
she's a Holy Maiden,

360
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,171
but because she's my
precious little sister.

361
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,840
Whether I have to fight
or negotiate with him,

362
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,676
as long as she
remains his hostage,

363
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,304
then I won't have the freedom
I need in order to act.

364
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,514
Demon Lord.

365
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,100
I will not allow you
to have your way!

366
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,270
Seraph's Bound, now!

367
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,527
[WHITE gasps]
Huh?

368
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:54,865
[BUNNY WORKERS chattering]

369
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,540
What is all of this?

370
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,167
Oh, no, I didn't
screw this up, did I?

371
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,592
[TAHARA]
Hm? Hey, lady, stop there!

372
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,552
[WHITE]
Uh, yes?

373
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,762
Hold on, are you the
one we asked for

374
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,848
that can use "Light" magic?

375
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,683
Magic crystals are all you.

376
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,268
I'm sorry, what?

377
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,312
[TAHARA] What are you
standing around for?

378
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,730
And who in the heck
shows up to work

379
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,524
wearing a fluffy pink
dress like that?

380
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,860
You think work is a tea party?

381
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,070
This ain't some
princess ball, you know.

382
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,865
I... Huh?

383
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,116
Now go get to work!

384
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,451
[WHITE]
R‐Right!

385
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,876
[sighs]

386
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:50,046
Uh‐‐wait just a minute.
Why am I doing this?

387
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,965
And who was that super‐rude man?

388
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,133
[LUNA]
Sister?

389
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:55,384
[WHITE gasps]

390
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,094
What are you doing here?

391
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,512
[WHITE]
Luna!

392
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,973
Listen, we need to
get out of here.

393
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,893
I'm afraid you've been terribly
tricked by that Demon Lord.

394
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:07,104
Huh? What in the world
are you talking about?

395
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,147
[WHITE groans]

396
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,025
Hey! By the way, get
a load of these, Sis!

397
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,443
Aren't they ginormous?

398
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,363
[WHITE] Is this any time to
be bragging about carrots?

399
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,406
Let's hurry back
to the Holy Castle!

400
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,783
I'm not going back!

401
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,201
I'm way too busy.

402
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,329
Right smack in the middle of
revamping my territory and all.

403
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:26,916
And, you know, it's kind of
a monstrous undertaking.

404
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,377
Oh? "Monstrous," huh?

405
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,757
[WHITE] I mean, what? Is he
planning to use this village

406
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,135
as a base to gather
a horde of monsters?

407
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,013
To begin with, why don't you
tell me where he would have

408
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,766
gotten the money for
such a large operation?

409
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:44,642
I don't know.

410
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,186
I heard a rumor that he sold
a holy coin or something,

411
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,105
but I'm not exactly sure.

412
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,399
[WHITE]
A sacred, holy coin?

413
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,608
‐‐[TRON] Luna.
‐‐[LUNA] Hmm?

414
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,610
[TRON] They've been
calling for you over there.

415
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:57,571
What, again?
What is it this time?

416
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,990
[TRON] There's a big
boulder blocking the way.

417
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,034
Can you break it
with your goldie?

418
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,869
There's really no helping it!

419
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:04,787
Without me around,

420
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,498
no one can ever seem to
accomplish anything at all!

421
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,374
How sad!

422
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,292
Hurry and come with me.

423
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,713
[LUNA] Hold up!
Quit pulling on my clothes!

424
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,881
Guess I'll talk
to you later, Sis!

425
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,133
Kyon, Momo!

426
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,636
Do me a favor and show my
sister to the hot springs, 'kay?

427
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,972
[WHITE] There's not a
single doubt in my mind.

428
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,974
That girl has Devil blood.

429
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,435
A despicable Devil.

430
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,979
We'll guide you there! Hop, hop!

431
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:35,609
[WHITE] I can't believe Luna's
been bewitched to this extent!

432
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,322
Miss Luna will be back
to join you a bit later.

433
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,742
Feel free to bathe
without her, bunny.

434
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,201
Bathing?

435
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,831
Use the changing room
inside to undress.

436
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,374
And don't hesitate
to let us know

437
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,293
if you need anything, bunny!

438
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,715
[WHITE] I think the only
way to free Luna now

439
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,800
is to topple the Demon Lord.

440
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,762
And, anyway, why a bath?

441
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,979
[WHITE] I suppose a bath
is an appropriate place

442
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,231
to examine the naked truth.

443
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,777
And this may be my very last
chance to persuade Luna.

444
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,909
[gasps]

445
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,368
[WHITE]
Is this...?

446
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,122
[WHITE]
These are all baths?

447
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,707
All of them?

448
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,293
[WHITE]
It's‐‐

449
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:37,046
I mean, what is the
Demon Lord thinking?

450
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,258
[WHITE]
Huh? Is that...?

451
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:50,893
[WHITE gasps]
There are more baths outside?

452
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,604
[gasps]

453
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,280
[OONO]
I reach out my hand

454
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:29,033
and brush aside the
bangs on Aku's face.

455
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,409
[AKU]
Demon Lord?

456
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:33,245
[KUNAI] Yes. Your eyes
are as pretty as ever.

457
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:36,665
[AKU] It's just that I
don't actually like my eyes.

458
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:40,085
[KUNAI] Well, I sure do.
Looking at them calms me.

459
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,296
[AKU gasps]

460
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,923
[OONO] Some people
might find it strange

461
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,466
that her eyes are
two different colors,

462
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,344
but it doesn't bother me.

463
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,597
[KUNAI] Next time:
<i>Demon Lord, Retry</i> Episode 12.

464
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,933
"White Angel and Demon Lord."
