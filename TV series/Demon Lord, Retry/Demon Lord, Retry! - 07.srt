Wonderful.

00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,881
What an annoying place
I've been summoned to.

164
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,425
A divine barrier, huh?

165
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,352
[ORUIT]
Hmm.

166
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,229
This evil power.

167
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,481
Is it... a Head Devil?

Well, this place is
truly unpleasant. Hmm.

Whoa, it's the prince!

172
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,961
What the hell is
going on around here?

173
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,923
Even better, the angels sent
some of their dogs to play.

It's just as I thought.

190
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:14,192
It's simply the fate of darkness
to be drawn by other darkness.

She's outrageously
beautiful on the outside,

but if she's
related to those two,

before I got to it.

00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:57,446
It's been so long
that I forgot how to.

326
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:00,574
[ORUIT] What in the world
is that healing power?

327
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,369
Don't tell me he's
a new race of dragon.

328
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:07,123
This is dangerous,
too dangerous!

329
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,083
Well, if that's really the case,

330
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,795
I vow on my soul to kill
this dragon no matter what!

331
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,854
[ORUIT growls]

332
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:35,651
You piss me off, Dragon.

333
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,279
Now, I will judge you.

334
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,614
Your arrogance will be punished.

335
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,575
[TRON gasps]

336
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,577
[KIRISAME]
I recommend smiling, runt.

337
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,494
[TRON gasps]

338
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,747
[KIRISAME]
No matter how tough it gets,

339
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,750
the ones who keep
smiling like idiots‐‐

340
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,294
they're stronger
than anyone else.

341
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,545
[TRON gasps]

342
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,923
Dragon! This is the end
of your arrogance!

343
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,551
Say goodbye to this world!

344
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:05,514
[KIRISAME]
Heaven! Watch and learn!

345
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,563
[KIRISAME]
All or nothing!

346
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,941
[KIRISAME yelling]

347
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:20,070
[ORUIT growling]

348
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:27,912
[ORUIT roars]

349
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,572
[AKU]
Demon Lord! Watch this!

350
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,490
[KUNAI]
Hmm? What is it?

351
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,783
[AKU]
Ahem!

352
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,494
"I'm the very
definition of unrivaled!"

353
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,329
[KUNAI]
Huh?

354
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,457
[AKU] "I've found my truth
down the path of carnage!"

355
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,374
[KUNAI]
What is this?

356
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,668
[AKU]
"Heaven! Watch and learn!"

357
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,502
[KUNAI]
Stop!

358
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,255
[AKU]
"All or nothing!"

359
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:46,759
[KUNAI] I think someone put her
up to this like last time.

360
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,720
[AKU] Next time:
<i>Demon Lord, Retry</i> Episode 8.

361
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,180
"Demon Lord's Handiwork."

362
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,974
[KUNAI]
Whoever you are, show yourself!
