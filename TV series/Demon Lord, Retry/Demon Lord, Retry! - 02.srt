1
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,852
[LUNA]
Hey, watch it!

2
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,896
Be a little more careful
where you're going!

3
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:23,440
I'm terribly sorry, Miss Luna,
please forgive me!

4
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:25,317
What, do you think it's
funny or something?

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,278
Bruising my butt right before
I subdue the Demon Lord?

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,780
[COACH 2A]
Uh, begging your pardon,

7
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,366
but is this even a good idea
without the other Holy Maidens?

8
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,493
[LUNA] Excuse me,
what are you suggesting?

9
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,995
Are you saying it's too
much for me to handle?

10
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,747
[COACH 2A]
No, of course not!

11
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,290
You're more than
enough on your own.

12
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,751
[LUNA]
Hmph! Of course I am.

13
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,503
Can't let my sisters show me up.

14
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,713
Well, not forever, anyway!

15
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:32,444
Reporting in!

16
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,780
I've just seen the Holy
Maiden, Luna Elegant.

17
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,907
She's approaching this
way on the road, sir,

18
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,825
with an escort of 20 troops!

19
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,077
Really?

20
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,497
Does that mean she's come here
to subjugate us, at last?

21
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,919
[WENGOAL] What a great
honor for a Holy Maiden

22
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,380
to come deal with us
herself, don't you think?

23
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,590
I look forward to
facing her head‐on.

24
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,009
[SCOUT 2A] Well, actually,
unless I'm mistaken,

25
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,221
it doesn't seem like
her target is us Moles.

26
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,597
[WENGOAL]
Oh?

27
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,854
It's starting to get
dark pretty quickly now.

28
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,399
Yeah, that appears to be true.

29
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,360
Whaddya think,
should we camp out here?

30
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,445
[AKU]
Really? Right here?

31
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:19,866
[AKU gasps]

32
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,327
Come forth, fragment
of my intelligence!

33
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,912
Fulfill my need.

34
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,539
Survival Goods!

35
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,709
[AKU gasps]

36
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,253
There is no end to the
depth of my darkness!

37
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,380
Defense goods, now!

38
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,092
Whoa!

39
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,178
[KUNAI]
Believe it or not, on their own,

40
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,097
they don't achieve much, but...

41
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,932
Item Combine!

42
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,852
[KUNAI]
Construct Base!

43
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,355
Wow, that was incredible!

44
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,566
Did I just witness some magic?

45
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,652
I can't get over how
wonderful you are!

46
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,864
[KUNAI laughs]
You have no idea!

47
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,117
This baby can even withstand an
attack from a rocket launcher.

48
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,994
You're as good as
dead in <i>Infinity Game</i>

49
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,328
unless you camp like this.

50
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,707
If you don't,
it's practically suicidal.

51
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,001
That sounds really fascinating.

52
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,129
Not that I understand exactly
what you're talking about.

53
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:17,090
I'm just saying it's
pretty sturdy, that's all.

54
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,010
You're looking at our little
home for tonight, Aku.

55
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,219
I'm a pretty delicate guy,

56
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,263
so there's no way I'm
camping under the stars

57
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,681
or any crap like that.

58
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:28,643
Great! And you can leave
all the chores to me!

59
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:32,105
[AKU gasps]
Is this a...?

60
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:35,358
[KUNAI] Go on. Relax and
give that tired body a wash.

61
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,360
But, hold on a second!

62
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,238
It's just, I couldn't
possibly use this.

63
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,449
Sorry, I get that it's cramped,

64
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,160
but this is the best
I can do for right now.

65
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,162
No, that's not what I meant.

66
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,371
Just wait and see.

67
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,500
Someday, I'm gonna build an
entire hot spring resort,

68
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,169
and you'll love every
single minute of it!

69
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,133
How interesting. I wonder
what a "hot spring resort" is.

70
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,889
[OONO] Well, looks like
this world has a moon, too.

71
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,724
What if I gather
enough skill points

72
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,060
to unlock administrator
privileges?

73
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,729
Could that help me
return to my world?

74
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:13,772
Although,

75
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:17,067
I know that whole system is
based off of <i>Infinity Game</i>,

76
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:17,943
and unfortunately,

77
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,655
it's not like there's a
"return to my world" command.

78
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,157
If being summoned by that
idol is what brought me here,

79
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,951
then chances are
the only way to return

80
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:30,205
would be to seek out something
with a similar type of power.

81
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:33,792
[OONO sighs] Let's hope I find
a clue in the Holy Capital.

82
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,670
[OONO]
But even if I do go back,

83
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,005
would I still have the
same life from before?

84
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,924
Do I still have a job?

85
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:44,052
I bet my manager's pissed.

86
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,224
[AKU]
Demon Lord, thank you!

87
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,852
I washed myself with
that sapo again.

88
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,150
Yep. You don't smell like
garbage and sad anymore.

89
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,278
Oh, my gosh,
do you really mean it?

90
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,489
That's the first time anybody
has ever said that to me!

91
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:13,039
[KUNAI] Are you planning
to sleep right there?

92
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,833
[AKU]
Is that okay?

93
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,043
[KUNAI groans]

94
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,337
[KUNAI] I know you're getting
these kind of paternal vibes

95
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,297
from me right now,

96
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,215
but I'm more like
older brother material.

97
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,759
I'm not some old man!

98
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,011
[AKU]
Demon Lord?

99
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,931
I don't really understand, so I
think I'm gonna go to sleep.

100
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,687
[BANDITS chattering]

101
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,315
[WENGOAL] Bring it on,
Holy Maiden and friends.

102
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:42,319
We'd silence a crying baby
before we'd let you sneak past.

103
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,946
Nothing slips under
the Moles' noses.

104
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,203
[WENGOAL]
What the hell? Who're those two?

105
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,914
What do you want
us to do, Chief?

106
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,625
Well, I'm guessing they're bait.

107
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,878
So, the moment we attack them,
the Holy Maiden and her crew

108
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,297
will most likely jump
out and ambush us.

109
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,799
Should we do nothing
and let them go, then?

110
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,843
No, we'll get 'em.

111
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,929
A quick attack and
a quick retreat.

112
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,307
Draw the Holy Maiden out
into unfamiliar terrain.

113
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,063
[KUNAI]
These guys are such a joke,

114
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,898
but I'll go ahead and
turn off my intercept

115
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,651
and auto‐attack
abilities just in case.

116
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,114
[KUNAI]
Aku, stand back.

117
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,491
[AKU]
Huh?

118
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,577
[KUNAI] I guess I should
just take this attack.

119
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,538
Hmph, really, though?
Under level 30?

120
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,707
Do you even grind?

121
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,502
[OONO] In <i>Infinity Game</i>, only
players at the max level of 30

122
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,171
were able to inflict any
sort of damage to Kunai,

123
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,508
so if that holds true here,
this guy's no threat.

124
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,679
[KUNAI] How about if we
just skip the hide‐and‐seek

125
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,263
and you show yourself?

126
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:58,895
[BANDITS cackling]

127
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,689
[WENGOAL]
Hey there, tough guy.

128
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,275
I'm Chief of the Moles.
Call me O Wengoal!

129
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,443
And you are?

130
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,153
That's my manager!

131
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,906
What in the world
is he doing here?

132
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,491
Sorry I've been out.

133
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,827
I seem to've gotten
<i>isekai</i>‐ed somehow.

134
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,954
What are you talking about?

135
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:21,001
Okay. What the hell.
I swear it's him.

136
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,836
[WENGOAL]
Quit mumbling to yourself.

137
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,045
Uh, just checking.

138
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,424
You aren't my manager, Aoki?

139
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,217
Hah. I see.

140
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,511
You're trying to confuse
me now, aren't you?

141
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,304
'Cause that's a
waste of your time.

142
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:37,017
No, that wasn't
my intention, but...

143
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:40,895
[OONO] I mean, am I going insane
or do they look exactly alike?

144
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,482
Considering that trick
you just conjured up,

145
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,776
I'm taking it you're
a magic user?

146
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,862
[KUNAI] I've got no
obligation to answer that.

147
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,531
Try to ignore us
and you'll get hurt.

148
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,116
Got it, geezer bait?

149
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,784
Who're you calling geezer?

150
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,828
Seriously, you're older than me!

151
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,038
Are you kidding me?

152
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,123
If anyone here is
sporting an old stank face,

153
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,624
it's definitely you!

154
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,587
[WENGOAL, KUNAI yelling]

155
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,089
[AKU] Mister Demon Lord,
let's get out of here!

156
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:12,510
Did she call you a Demon Lord?
A diaper baby like you?

Go pretend you're a Demon

had to be a magic user!

'Kay, what the?

00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,659
[LUNA] Who would've thought
I'd go Demon Lord hunting

166
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,496
and end up with a bunch a
filthy bandits in the bargain?

167
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,623
Crap, everything's ruined.

168
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,917
Pull back, men! Retreat!

00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,543
[LUNA]
How stupid can you be?

170
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,713
Do you actually think
you can get away from me?

171
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,757
Be torn asunder by gold!

Ow, ow.

My Assault Barrier

So, this kid is max level?

180
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:11,402
To be honest, I wasn't
expecting very much out of you.

181
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,697
What did you just say?
That was awfully rude!

182
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,283
[KUNAI] Anyway, do I not
at least get an apology

183
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,953
for being attacked
without any provocation?

184
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,372
[LUNA] Hmph! A Holy
Maiden dispatching evil

185
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,250
is just plain common sense,
you should know that.

186
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,334
All right, then.

187

I'm fine with those
being your last words.

Aww. Seems to me as if you
don't have any idea who I am.

189

I'm one of the

The Golden Luna Elegant.

Your name's "Elegant"

and you go around shooting off
magic like some kinda maniac?

Way to not live up
to the name, squirt.

happen to be women.

Ow, my butt! You're
hurting my poor butt!

215
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,196
That one would be
for attacking me!

216
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,489
And this is for
underestimating me!

217
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,575
Let's see, what else
can I think of?

No, you have to stop!

219
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:42,911
[KUNAI]
And this one

220
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,246
is frankly because
I'm really enjoying this.

221

[LUNA]
Ow!

222
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,099
[KUNAI sighs]
Well, that was a good workout.

223
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,810
I kinda wonder about the
Holy Maiden's butt, though.

224
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,520
Do you think it'll be okay?

225
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,649
I'm pretty sure it's already got
a split in it. She'll be fine.

226
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,360
Right, that's not quite
what I meant, though.

227
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,822
[KUNAI] Now then. Since we've
got all this money to blow,

228
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,200
what would you say to
a stay in the city?

229
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,622
[LUNA groans] I'm totally
going to kill that guy!

230
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,041
You just wait and
see if I don't!

231
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,501
You idiot coachman!

232
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,628
Didn't I already tell you
to go a whole lot slower

233
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,755
because this stings my butt?

234
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,843
Really.

235
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,470
Whoever named things
in this kingdom

236
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,597
needs a kick right in the scrod.

You think so?

00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,685
[KUNAI] Come on, let's buy
a bunch of random stuff

00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,436
with all this money.

240
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,481
[AKU] But that money belongs to
the Holy Maiden, doesn't it?

241
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,192
[KUNAI] Hey, I was
acting in self‐defense.

242
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,360
In fact, it could be argued

243
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,821
that I was actually
being kind and lenient.

244
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:00,905
If this were an <i>eroge</i>,

245
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,074
we'd be heading for
a sex slave route.

[AKU] Mister Demon Lord,
what's <i>eroge</i>?

248
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,626
[KUNAI]
How much?

249
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,004
[VENDOR 2A] It'll be three
coppers for two skewers.

[VENDOR 2A]
Thank you. Come again!

Um, what's this?

252
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:28,891
Look, it's my treat today.
Just eat it and enjoy, okay?

253
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,815
I've never eaten anything
this delicious before!

[KUNAI chuckles]

255
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,404

terrible name after another.

You think so?

257
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,700
I've always kinda thought
this was a cute name.

[GUGULE WORKER 2A]
Welcome.

259
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,746
[KUNAI] I'd like the
best room you've got.

260
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,832
If you'd like to stay
in our premiere room,

261
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,043
that would cost one gold coin.

262
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,879
Oh, no, we shouldn't spend
that much, Mister Demon Lord!

263
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,756
Uh, Demon Lord?

264
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,009
My name's De Mon, so it's
kinda turned into a joke.

265
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,428
Sorry to freak you
out like that!

266
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,639
[KUNAI]
Now, if you please.

267
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,808
Right. Of course,
very good, sir.

268
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,518
I'll go prepare the room.

269
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,648
[KUNAI] You can't call me
"Demon Lord" in front of people!

270
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,277
Refer to me as your older
brother or something!

271
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,739
[AKU] Well, what about
if I call you "Papa"?

272
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:28,242
[KUNAI] I'm still a young,
swingin' single dude!

[KUNAI] Hmm. Not a bad view,
if I do say so myself.

277

[OONO]
If I'm honest,

278
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:46,844
I'm surprised at how luxurious
this place actually is.

279
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,388
But, of course, I can't let on

280
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,890
'cause I've got to keep
my cool around Aku.

281
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,643
[AKU]
Gorgeous!

282
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,521
It's almost like we're
staying at a noble's estate!

283
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,856
Well you're easily
impressed, aren't you?

284
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,234
This is nothing compared
to the castle I'll build

285
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,736
befitting my greatness one day.

286
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,655
A castle, huh?

287
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,615
I mean, I'm not sure
what you're talking about,

288
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,033
but it sounds great!

289
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,868
Now then, I'm thinking
we should definitely

290
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,413
treat ourselves to a
nice dinner tonight.

291
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:17,250
But, uh, one order
of business first.

292
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,173
[BINGO] Dear me, that's one
shabby outfit. Poor thing.

293
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:27,093
I wonder if she's his
servant or something?

294
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,594
Welcome to you both!

295
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,514
Is there anything in particular
that you're looking for?

296
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,266
Thanks, yeah,
we could use a little help

297
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,852
finding this one a new
outfit that suits her.

298
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:39,021
I'm not really the best at
picking out clothes for people.

299
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,691
I'd rather leave
that to the pros.

300
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,527
Okay, hold on, this one
looks like the biggest.

301
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,028
I'm gonna use this guy.

302
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,114
[BINGO]
What?

303
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,907
No, Demon Lo‐‐

304
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,034
Just so we're clear,
you're planning to spend that

305
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,370
giant gold coin in
our establishment?

306
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,580
[KUNAI]
Is it not enough?

307
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,458
Ha, ha! Don't be silly!
We're at your service!

308
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,294
I'll go put something together
for you immediately!

309
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,839
Hello, miss! Right this way.

310
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,549
Oh, okay.

311
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:12,555
I'd like to smoke, but I'm
not seeing any ash trays.

312
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:13,598
Use my hands!

313
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,185
It would be an honor for you to
dispose of your ash on my body!

314
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,645
Oh, uh, no, that
won't be necessary!

315
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,356
All I need is an ash tray
and a place to sit down, so‐‐

316
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,316
Use me!

317
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,152
Please, sir, it'd be my pleasure
for you to sit on my back!

318
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:29,530
[OONO] What the hell?
This place is a little scary.

319
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,118
[AKU]
I'm sorry to make you wait.

320
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,580
[AKU]
I don't know.

321
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:41,125
Do you think this outfit
looks okay on me?

322
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,378
[OONO] Ooh! I figured she'd
shine up with a bit of polish,

323
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,507
but this is such a
big transformation!

324
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,176
Uh. Yeah.

325
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,473
[OONO] Whoa! Since when did Aku
have different colored eyes?

326
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,808
How did I miss that?

327
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,685
Maybe I shouldn't
mention it, though.

328
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,978
‐‐[rustling]
‐‐[KUNAI] Hm?

329
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,188
If you'd like, I can also

330
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,565
bring you several other
options to look over.

331
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,776
Just say the word,
and it's done.

332
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,277
[KUNAI]
Let's see.

333
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,446
Yes, I'll take everything
that suits her.

334
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:13,616
I'm sorry, sir, but did you
really just say "everything"?

335
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:14,992
Yeah, I'll buy it all.

336
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,953
Ladies, quick! Bring me the best

337
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,664
of everything we have
in the young miss's size!

338
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,588
[LADY 2A] I wonder if they're
father and daughter.

339
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,508
[LADY 2B] I don't really get
that vibe, though, do you?

340
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,884
[GENTLEMAN 2A]
I think he must own some land

341
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,095
around here or something.

342
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,763
[GENTLEMAN 2B]
I heard he paid for her outfit

343
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,891
with a giant gold coin
without batting an eye.

344
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:45,022
[CUSTOMERS whispering]

345
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,357
[GENTLEMAN 2A]
Ooh! See that?

346
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,110
He chose a wine only a true
connoisseur would order!

347
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,821
[GENTLEMAN 2B] Seems like
he's a man of good taste.

348
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,206
It seriously feels
like I'm dreaming.

349
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,417
[KUNAI]
Hm?

350
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,502
[AKU]
I just can't thank you enough

351
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,255
for doing all of this
for someone like me.

352
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,048
Don't worry about it.

353
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,718
Let's just eat before
it gets cold, okay?

354
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,803
[AKU]
I do worry about it!

355
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:19,515
It's weird. Why are you
being so nice to me?

356
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,642
[OONO]
I mean, that's a fair question.

357
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,687
<i>I</i> wonder what makes
me go so far for her.

358
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,983
Would you please tell
me if there's any way

359
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,486
to repay you for your
great kindness to me?

360
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,821
Anything that you want!

361
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:38,075
If it's something I can do,
then I'll do it for you!

362
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,787
Did you really just offer
to do anything I want?

363
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,748
‐‐[AKU gasps]
‐‐[KUNAI] Hm?

364
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,292
Now I've got you, Demon Lord!

365
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,585
[GENTLEMAN 2A]
"Demon Lord"?

366
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,171
[LADY 2A] I wonder if she's
talking about that man!

367
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,465
You dare to sit here
and eat with my money?

368
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,550
Are you stupid?
Do you wanna die?

369
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,093
[KUNAI]
I think you're forgetting.

370
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,553
That money's mine now.

371
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,472
You offered it to
me as an apology.

372
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,098
'Cause if I hadn't done that,

373
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,060
you wouldn't have stopped with
the endless spanking of my butt!

374
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,103
Okay, no need to mess yourself.

375
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,189
Why don't you sit
down and join us?

376
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,192
We wouldn't want to disturb the
other guests, now, would we?

377
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,654
Give me one good reason why I
should listen to you! [gasps]

378
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,491
[KUNAI] Well, do you want
to be disciplined again?

379
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,659
[gasps]

380
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,416
[KUNAI] Glad to see you
know how to be reasonable.

381
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,753
Everyone, I'd like to apologize
for causing that commotion.

382
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:31,962
If you'd allow me,

383
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,422
I'd like to make
it up to you all

384
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,466
by treating each table
to a bottle of wine,

385
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,634
with my compliments.

386
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,511
Oh, my, that's so generous!

387
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,472
Yeah, he seems like a
really upstanding guy.

388
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,308
<i>Garson</i>, something nice
for the little lady.

389
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,187
[KUNAI] It's my treat,
so have as much as you'd like.

390
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:51,941
You jerk! More like
it's my treat, right?

391
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:55,319
Um. I'm so sorry, Holy Maiden.

392
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,947
But the Demon Lord isn't
actually a bad person, you know.

393
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,990
What's wrong with you?

394
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,660
There's no such thing
as a good Demon Lord!

395
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,120
[AKU]
Huh?

396
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,039
I guess it's true.

397
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:10,626
You can be so kind sometimes,
but you can also be mean.

398
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:13,421
I always act like a
perfect gentleman.

399
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,132
It's just that I'm picky
about who I treat nicely.

400
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,134
Oh, dear.

401
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,552
The Holy Maiden is actually

402
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,346
a very important
person, Demon Lord.

403
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,142
[AKU gasps]

404
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,017
[OONO]
Well,

405
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,563
I guess I can't carry her on
my back with a dress on, so.

406
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:36,068
[AKU] Okay, I've changed
my mind. You're mostly kind.

407
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,069
[KUNAI]
Hm?

408
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,075
[knocking]

409
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,163
Idiot! Now I've got no
money to stay anywhere,

410
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,414
and it's all thanks to you!

411
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:51,125
[KUNAI] What's the problem?
Can't you just camp somewhere?

412
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,961
Whatever happened to your
troupe, sad little Luna?

413
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,130
I sent them home,
thank you very much!

414
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,007
[KUNAI]
Really? Why would you do that?

415
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,009
[LUNA]
Why do you think? Because...

416
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,470
I didn't want to put them in any
more danger for no good reason!

417
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,055
So you thought it might be a
good time for us to hang out?

418
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,349
No! That's not what
I'm saying at all!

419
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,809
[AKU]
Demon Lord!

420
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:11,353
Sorry, but could you please
be a little bit nicer

421
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,105
to the Holy Maiden?

422
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,649
[KUNAI]
All right, then. Here.

423
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,611
What is it?

424
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,404
Is there something
else that you want?

425
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,531
O‐Okay, fine, so be it.

426
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,576
I'll let the two of you
stay in this room with me.

427
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,578
[KUNAI] You sure your
head's on straight?

428
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,372
[LUNA] Well, you reserved the
room with my money, didn't you?

429
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,292
I'd say it's only proper that
I'm allowed to sleep in it!

430
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:36,879
Oh, wow, I think she might
have you there, Demon Lord!

431
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:39,381
[KUNAI groans]

432
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:45,387
[BANDITS yelling]

433
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,599
Sister! We've almost
reached the city!

434
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,559
[KILLER QUEEN]
How dare that shitty brat.

435
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:53,187
She's gonna regret
causing me trouble.

436
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:28,616
[OONO] Okay, favorite
old‐school games. I'll start!

437
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,784
<i>Shenmue</i>'s definitely
gotta be on the list.

438
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,704
An open world in a time
like that was just amazing.

439
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:37,291
With motion capture and fully‐
voiced NPCs in the city, too.

440
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,251
Not to mention having
a full game cycle

441
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:42,755
of morning, noon, and night.
That was so sick!

442
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,132
It's making me wanna
play again. Loved it!

443
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:48,636
[AKU] Demon Lord. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

444
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,931
[KUNAI] Next time:
<i>Demon Lord, Retry</i> Episode 3.

445
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,557
"Killer Queen."
