1
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:20,312
[LUNA] So. You said your name
was Aku, isn't that right?

2
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,271
[gasps]

3
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:24,316
Well, from now on, I want
you to call me Sister Luna.

4
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:28,445
Is it okay for me to be so
informal with a Holy Maiden?

5
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,697
I say it's fine,
therefore, it's fine.

6
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,491
I make the rules here.

7
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,742
Right.

8
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,494
[LUNA] Besides, we're already
comfy enough together

9
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,746
to see each other
naked! [giggles]

10
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,039
Here I come!

11
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,667
[AKU] Whoa! What're
you doing down there?

12
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,386
Administrator privileges.

13
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,887
Item file.

14
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,108
[OONO]
I'm so used to <i>Infinity Game</i>,

15
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:10,112
where players couldn't hold any
more than ten items at a time.

16
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,989
Getting to store
infinite items like this

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,658
makes things a lot easier.

18
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,953
[KUNAI]
Luna, got a minute?

19
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,496
Sorry, you say something?

20
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,082
Are we on a first
name basis now?

21
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:24,084
Fine. Whatever.
I just need you to tell me

22
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,169
everything you know
about the Cherub.

23
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,338
Um, pardon me, Sister Luna.

24
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,715
It's just that Demon Lord isn't

25
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,967
very knowledgeable
about this stuff.

26
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,137
Do you think you could tell
him what he needs to know?

27
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,430
The Cherub is dead.

28
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,099
It died after sealing
the Demon King, Greyole.

29
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,184
Doing that used up
all its power.

30
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,520
Well, you don't say.

31
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:44,688
[LUNA]
Thankfully for us,

32
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,899
the Kingdom of Holy Light still
has the Ophan and the Seraph,

33
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,569
and they serve as
guides to the people.

34
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,070
To think the peace
of the kingdom

35
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,322
could actually be threatened.

36
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,157
That's truly absurd.

37
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,538
[SOLDIERS hollering]

38
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,706
Sister!

39
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:05,417
We've almost reached
the city of Yahoo!

40
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,837
Good. I'm ready to tie a rope
around that friggin' brat's neck

41
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,464
and drag her home.

42
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:14,426
I gotta say, it's gutsy of her
to try to subdue a Demon Lord.

43
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,137
We're all pretty impressed with
your sister's fierce bravery

44
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,097
and her utter fearlessness!

45
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,807
You're all morons.

46
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,061
That little twerp's just
doing it for attention.

47
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,356
As if a Demon Lord exists,
anyway, the idiot.

48
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,815
But lots of people
are saying that

49
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,360
Greole really was
killed by someone!

50
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,362
Hmph, you're such a meat‐head.

51
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:37,282
How dare my big sister withhold
information from me like that!

52
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,661
[KILLER QUEEN] Did you really
think you could ever beat me,

53
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,079
you maggot?

54
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,771
[KUNAI] I've got a grasp
on the Cherub situation.

55
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:31,897
So?

56
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,858
Do you care to tell me where I
can find the Ophan and Seraph?

57
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,819
Dunno. It's been ages
since anyone in the kingdom

58
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,030
has seen either of them.

59
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,783
[KUNAI]
Oh, it's only a legend, then.

60
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,701
There are some
misguided believers

61
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,037
who have convinced themselves
that the stone statue

62
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,414
at the Wishing Shrine
is actually the Ophan.

63
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,000
But it's fine. They'll
get divine retribution

64
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,627
for that someday.

65
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:55,921
[KUNAI]
Could it be possible

66
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,966
that the Idol
actually was the Ophan?

67
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,719
[IDOL] I was once a
beautiful sight to behold.

68
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:06,515
A symbol of purity, but many
years of granting wicked wishes

69
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:10,018
to humans turned me into this.

70
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,603
[KUNAI] Still don't
have enough information

71
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,147
to form a proper plan just yet.

72
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,234
I've gotta gather more
intel in the Holy Capital.

73
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,860
But before I can do that,

74
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:22,447
I guess I'd better do something
about this empty wallet of mine.

75
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,744
[KUNAI] In my motherland,
we've traditionally had

76
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,622
a strong appreciation
for taste and elegance.

77
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,624
So, everyone always
presents their finest wares

78
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,042
when serving tea.

79
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,586
In fact, you're considered
an embarrassment to your family

80
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,339
if you dare to put out
something that looks cheap.

81
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:43,343
Well, goodness, that
certainly is interesting.

82
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,179
[KUNAI] So, today. I've brought
my very favorite tea bowl

83
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,223
from my motherland with me.

84
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:52,310
It's incredible!
Look how splendid it is!

85
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,813
[OONO] Right, as in this
trash I literally just made

86
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,108
with a few skill points and
that only gives one offense?

87
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,151
I just don't get it.

88
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,655
So, tell me, how much would it
cost for you to part with it?

89
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,823
No, no, no.

90
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,284
I'd like for you to think of
this as a small token given

91
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,787
only in hopes of establishing
a long‐lasting partnership.

92
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:14,291
However, seeing as how I don't
have very much money on hand,

93
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,877
I'd be happy to accept
one giant gold coin

94
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,254
as collateral if you're willing.

95
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,631
Um, one giant gold coin?

96
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,800
[OONO] That looked like
the most expensive coin

97
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,802
in Luna's bag by far, so.

98
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,637
I figured I should
probably start with that,

99
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,639
but who knows, I guess?

100
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,058
[MANNEN] I've heard all those
incredible rumors about you,

101
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,518
you know.

102
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,687
They whisper that
you're a cultured guy,

103
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,564
even descended from royalty,

104
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:40,066
as well as a very tolerant,
accepting gentleman.

105
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,485
[KUNAI laughs]

106
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,570
Who would dare go around

107
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,322
spreading baseless
rumors like that?

108
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,158
Look, I'm sure you must have
your own reasons for denying it,

109
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,994
but I can promise you, I won't
tell anyone else about it.

110
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,996
So no need to worry.

111
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,123
I'll gladly accept
your proposition.

112
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,208
Let me go get things
ready for you.

113
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,419
[KUNAI]
I appreciate your understanding.

114
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,212
But before that,
I think it's important

115
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,797
that I tell you something.

116
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,257
If you end up
selling the tea bowl,

117
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,426
you need to be sure to
take nothing less than

118
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,262
five giant gold coins in
exchange for it. You got that?

119
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,264
Whoa! Five giant coins?

120
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,099
Are you positive?

121
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,559
[KUNAI]
If you can't promise me that,

122
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,810
then let's just pretend like

123
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,187
this conversation
never happened.

124
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,481
[MANNEN]
No, wait, please! I understand.

125
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,900
I promise to honor your wishes.

126
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,403
[OONO] Holy crap,
that sold for a ton more

127
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,780
than I thought it would!

128
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,531
The value of stuff
here is way different

129
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,283
than in <i>Infinity Game</i>!

130
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,368
Cool.

131
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,578
I'll invite Aku and Luna
to dinner or something.

132
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,330
[KILLER QUEEN]
Luna! Get out here!

133
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,456
[KUNAI]
Hm?

134
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,878
[WALKING] As you know,
much to our disappointment,

135
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,505
we demon‐believing Satanists

136
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,383
failed in summoning
the Demon Lord.

137
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,843
But if it resulted in the
Holy Maidens mobilizing

138
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,138
and taking action, then I say
it was not done in vain.

139
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,557
We will eradicate the Holy
Maidens from this world

140
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,685
just as we had
originally planned.

141
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,021
[SATANISTS] May disaster
befall the Holy Maidens.

142
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,732
May it befall every one of them.

143
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:10,865
[CROWD whispering]

144
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,742
[KILLER QUEEN]
The second eldest Holy Maiden,

145
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,911
Killer Queen, has come!

146
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,871
Luna! Get out here!

147
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,216
[KUNAI] Great, this one's
gonna be a handful.

148
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,677
She's got those crazy eyes.

149
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,013
While we're at it,
if there's a Demon Lord,

150
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,764
get your ass out here, too!

151
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,391
[KUNAI]
Yeah right, are you kidding?

152
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,810
Go back to your post‐
apocalyptic nightmare!

153
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,186
[LUNA]
Get out of my way!

154
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,897
Move it, what's wrong with you?

155
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:46,026
[LUNA gasps] Hey, Sister!
What're you doing here?

156
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,360
Hey, you little brat!

157
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:51,114
How dare you run off to pick a
fight without telling anyone!

158

Could it even be possible
that they've formed

so curious about him?
