1
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:14,723
[OONO] Can't believe I kept
this running for 15 years.

2
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:17,142
Not bad since it
was just a hobby.

3
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,894
But once the clock
strikes midnight,

4
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,480
I'm shutting the
server down for good.

5
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:25,025
Thanks for sticking with
me till the end, everyone.

6
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:28,654
And thank you, Mister Demon
Lord of the Great Empire.

7
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,947
I've certainly enjoyed spreading

8
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:32,658
bloodshed and chaos
with you over the years.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,495
Goodbye, Kunai.

10
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,414
Sleep well, old friend.

11
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,632
[SERAPH] This is a
world abandoned by God.

12
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:52,177
A world where angels
drown in despair.

13
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,513
But do not let fear seize you.

14
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,057
You must listen very carefully.

15
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,893
Focus and you shall
surely hear it.

16
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,020
The midnight bell tolls.

17
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:07,359
It signals a new beginning,
the genesis of a new "you."

18
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,156
[KUNAI]
Holy‐‐

19
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,534
What just happened?

20
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,911
[KUNAI groans]
Huh?

21
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:22,082
[KUNAI] Where the hell did
all this nature come from?

22
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,545
[KUNAI]
I wasn't wearing those shoes.

23
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,172
And I know damn well I wasn't
sitting in front of the computer

24
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,967
dressed like a
frickin' mob boss!

25
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,970
Whatever's goin' on here,
it can't be good.

26
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:40,976
[gasps]

27
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,437
The Demon Lord, Hakuto Kunai.

28
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,814
This must be <i>Infinity Game</i>!

29
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,876
Who did this to me? [grunts]

30
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,505
Even if he's the Demon Lord,
I don't wanna be some old dude!

31
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,007
Wait, calm down.

32
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,468
There's gotta be an explanation.

33
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,636
'Cause there's no way in hell

34
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,973
I got teleported inside my
own damned computer game!

35
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,768
On the other hand, if it is
my game, the solution's easy.

36
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,272
[KUNAI]
Administrator!

37
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,775
Okay, now we're talkin'!

38
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,403
Put in my password
and that'll do it.

39
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,613
[KUNAI]
Huh?

40
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,866
So am I stuck in
a different game?

41
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,787
Kinda starting to wish I'd
watched more <i>isekai</i> anime,

42
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,790
so I'd have a clue what
the hell was going on.

43
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:15,714
[AKU panting]

44
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,091
[KUNAI]
Hm? Is someone there?

45
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:23,346
[AKU panting]

46
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,098
[OONO]
So I'm Kunai, right?

47
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,185
If I'm playing the part,
I gotta be a smug jerk.

48
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,189
[KUNAI]
Uh, what's up, peewee?

49
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,274
Oh, wait, do you even
speak my language?

50
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:35,609
You have to run!

51
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,777
[KUNAI]
Huh?

52
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,325
[KUNAI] I don't suppose
this big, angry fella

53
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,243
is a pet of yours, is he?

54
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,455
'Cause, uh, now might be a nice
time to ask him to roll over.

55
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,790
It's dangerous!

56
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,374
Get away, hurry!

57
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,251
[GREOLE growls]

58
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,961
Feeble human!

59
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,173
I shall feast on
your miserable flesh!

60
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,341
Scary!

61
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,051
[growls]

00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,511
[KUNAI grunts]

63
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,557
[roars]

64
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,353
Listen. You better
check yourself.

65
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,979
[GREOLE gasps]

66
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,607
[KUNAI grunts]

67
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:19,653
[GREOLE screams]

68
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,243
[OONO] I know this game
like the back of my hand

69
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,453
and I've never
seen one of those.

70
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,414
I think I'd remember
making a monster like that.

71
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,999
Same goes for that girl.

72
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,002
[gasping]

73
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,047
Demon Lord, please,
don't eat me!

74
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,716
I taste just awful, I promise!

75
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,218
Are you stupid?

76
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,303
The hell do you
take me for, kid?

77
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,431
[OONO gasps]
We do speak the same language.

78
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,850
Don't crap your pants.

79
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,061
No matter how hungry I get,
I'd never eat someone like you.

80
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,856
[gasps] Really? That's a relief.

81
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,358
[KUNAI] Where'd you get that
idea in the first place?

82
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,860
We've known each
other five minutes

83
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,736
and you're calling
me the "Demon Lord"?

84
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,322
Well, I mean,
you blew away Greole

85
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,366
without even breaking a sweat.

86
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,285
So, if you're not an angel,

87
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,996
what else could you be
but the Demon Lord, right?

88
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,623
My name is Kunai.

89
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,710
No "Demon Lord" or anything
else like that, okay?

90
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,587
[AKU]
Oh. I see.

91
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,964
Anyway. You got a name?

92
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,884
Sorry. My name's Aku.

93
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,510
[KUNAI, OONO chuckle]

94
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,138
[OONO]
"Aku?" Like "Evil"?

95
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:32,976
[KUNAI] Uh, well, that
has a lovely ring to it.

96
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,604
So, Aku, quick question.

97
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,523
We're not in Japan
right now, are we?

98
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,442
No. We're not.

99
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,611
I've never heard that word.

100
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,946
[KUNAI]
Hm...

101
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,991
[AKU] This land is known as
the Kingdom of Holy Light.

102
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,493
The people here
worship the Cherub.

103
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,371
[KUNAI]
The Cherub, huh? Tell me more.

104
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,917
[AKU] Well, it was the great
Cherub who sealed away Greole,

105
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,711
that monster you beat with
those knives of yours.

106
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,672
Beneath the Cherub are
the Three Holy Maidens,

107
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,215
then it's the Holy Knights,

108
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,927
and a big organization
called the Holy Church.

109
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,553
[KUNAI, OONO groan]

110
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,097
[OONO] Wow, this is just
generic fantasy land,

111
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,350
right down to the names, huh?

112
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,477
But if this isn't my
world like I thought,

113
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,395
then why did I
get summoned here?

114
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,522
I'm nobody important.

115
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,690
[OONO gasps]

116
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,776
[OONO] What if someone was
trying to summon Kunai

117
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,861
and I got wrapped up in it?

118
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,781
I guess that makes
sense? Kind of?

119
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,327
[KUNAI] You wanna a take
a bath? You're a mess.

120
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,038
[gasps] Is it really okay?

121
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,623
[KUNAI]
Why wouldn't it be?

122
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,625
I'll go wait over there and
you can jump in the lake

123
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,295
and scrub all of that
muck off you. Sound good?

124
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,297
That sounds wonderful!

125
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,303
Take your time. Just yell
at me when you're done.

126
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,680
Okay!

127
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,314
I didn't know the Forest of
Wishes had such a nice lake.

128
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,691
It's so clear and pretty!

129
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,235
I've never bathed in
such clean water before!

130
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,945
It's amazing!

131
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,699
[AKU]
I'm so happy I'm still alive!

132
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,159
[AKU]
That aside,

133
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,204
I can't help but
wonder who that man is.

134
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,959
[AKU gasps] Wait! What if he
only asked me to clean myself

135
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,335
so I'm better to eat?

136
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,588
Got administrator
privileges! Yeah!

137
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,090
[AKU]
Administrator?

138
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,093
Now, Item File.

139
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,679
[AKU gasps]
Whoa, what's that?

140
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,768
[AKU] He's not getting out
his cooking utensils, is he?

141
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,730
Here's a bath towel for you.

142
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,106
You can clean
yourself with this.

143
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,525
[gasps]

144
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,278
Oh, wow, is this that
stuff they call "sapo"?

145
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,864
Who's "they"? Ancient Romans?

146
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,116
[AKU]
Romans? Are they from Japan?

147
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,784
Just forget it.

148
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,161
I'm gonna take a walk.

149
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,496
Scout the area for monsters.

150
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,297
[OONO] I'm gonna run out of
skill points at this rate.

151
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,549
Seems to work like
<i>Infinity Game</i>,

152
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,052
where I learn skills and
get back my skill points

153
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,220
after winning fights.

154
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,432
Summoning a bar of soap and a
towel cost me five points,

155
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,934
so I've only got about 30 left.

156
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,395
I need to come up with some
kind of strategy to get more,

157
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,814
or this is going to be a pain.

158
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:25,690
In <i>Infinity Game</i>,

159
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,234
you get the most points for
beating higher‐level enemies,

160
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,195
but I don't know what that
would be in this world

161
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,821
or where to find it.

162
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,740
[AKU]
Mister Demon Lord?

163
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,200
Sorry for the wait.

164
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,952
Thank you. The sapo was great!

165
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,706
Enough with the "Demon Lord"
crap already. [groans]

166
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,374
So, that monster.

167
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,710
Are there a lot of them
lurking around here?

168
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,253
No, of course not!

169
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,838
One Greole is already too many.

170
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,341
The whole kingdom would be
wiped out if there were more!

171
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,384
What? You mean that
stupid‐looking thing

172
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,844
was actually dangerous?

173
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,346
Uh‐huh, uh‐huh!

174
00:09:56,387 --> 00:10:00,225
[KUNAI sighs] Aku, do you know
where that thing's den is,

175
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,810
or maybe where it sleeps?

176
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,395
I could use some more
Skill Points and‐‐

177
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,271
[KUNAI clears throat]

178
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,315
I mean, there's
something I wanna see.

179
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,275
[AKU] I don't know
if this helps or not,

180
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,111
but I heard Greole
used to be sealed

181
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,530
at the Wishing Shrine
in this forest.

182
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,825
A Wishing Shrine, huh?
Since I'm new to the area,

183
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,535
y'think you could
guide me there?

184
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,995
[AKU]
Y‐Yeah, of course.

185
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,669
Tell me where to go and
I'll carry you on my back.

186
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,254
There's no need for that!

187
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,839
I'm filthy and disgusting.

188
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,049
You don't want someone
like me touching you!

189
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,760
Sorry, but I'm not gonna
sit here and argue with you.

190
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:39,472
Hurry up. Time to go.

191
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:42,225
[sobs]

192
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,727
[OONO]
Oh, come on, now you're crying?

193
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,396
You can't even humor me?

194
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,772
That hurts!

195
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,483
I've always been a burden.

196
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:53,027
My village would be
better without me.

197
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,113
That's why they have me
gather up all the garbage

198
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,906
from people's houses,

199
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,826
and throw out all
the human waste.

200
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,996
I've done the best I can, but...

201
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,330
Those are important jobs.

202
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,958
If you didn't do it, then the
villagers would get sick.

203
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,002
You shouldn't be ashamed at all.

204
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,003
But they...

205
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:13,715
They're always telling me
I'm filthy and disgusting.

206
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,177
And then they cast me out
as a sacrifice to Greole.

207
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,721
[AKU sobs]

208
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,015
[AKU]
Maybe it's better that way.

209
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:25,435
They all said they'd get
dirty if they touched me.

210
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,228
So you shouldn't‐‐

211
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,605
[AKU gasps]

212
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,610
[AKU] Wait! Weren't you
listening? You can't!

213
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,903
What the hell does it matter

214
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,322
if you get a little
dirty sometimes?

215
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,990
As long as you keep
your heart clean,

216
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,785
all you gotta do is take a bath
and you'll be as good as new.

217
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,374
Thank you, Mister Demon Lord.

218
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,251
You're so nice.

219
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,632
[KUNAI] Don't you think
you're holding on bit tight?

220
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,717
[AKU]
Oh. I might be.

221
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,596
But this is the first time I've
ever been so close to someone,

222
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,599
so it could take a
little getting used to.

223
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,240
Take a look at this.

224
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:24,118
Oh, wow! You have such
pretty handwriting!

225
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,289
Thanks, I guess,
but can you read it?

226
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,540
'Course I can!

227
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,751
Would you mind reading
it out for me, then?

228
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,503
"Hakuto Kunai."

229
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,420
"Aku."

230
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,964
"One plus one is two."

231
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,967
And the last one is "G. A. M. E."

232
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,134
Is that right?

233
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,678
That's right.

234
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,972
[OONO] Hmm. So we speak
the same language

235
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:47,433
and we read the same language,
but she's never heard of Japan.

236
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,979
I don't really get it,
but that's convenient at least.

237
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,648
[KUNAI] So how does this
Wishing Shrine work anyway?

238
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,816
Is it like one of those places

239
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,235
where you toss in money
and pray for good luck?

240
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,070
[AKU]
It's much more than that.

241
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,739
The Cherub used it
to seal away Greole.

242
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,283
I don't know the
details, myself,

243
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,743
but it must be very powerful!

244
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,245
"Powerful" like how?

245
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,707
It grants wishes. And not like
the "good luck" kind of stuff,

246
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,418
but real miracles that
can change the world!

247
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,044
Sounds like a fairy tale.

248
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,797
You could even wish for
more power, if you wanted to.

249
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,425
Then you could plunge the whole
world into a sea of darkness.

250
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,635
Why would I wanna do that?!

251
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,561
[KUNAI sniffs]

252
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,063
[KUNAI]
That's a bad sign.

253
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,316
I'm afraid it might
dangerous in there.

254
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,859
You wait outside for now.

255
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,652
[AKU]
Um, okay.

256
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,043
[KUNAI]
That explains the smell.

257
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,836
I figured as much.

258
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,921
Bleh!

259
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,840
[IDOL]
Interesting.

260
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:03,509
So this is our Demon Lord.

261
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,262
[gasps]

262
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,351
[IDOL] I've granted many wishes
in my time at this temple,

263
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,354
but I believe this
one shall be my last.

264
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:18,149
[KUNAI] Wait a second.
You know something, don't you?

265
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,400
It's like you were
waiting for me!

266
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,736
Were you the one
who summoned me here?

267
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,906
[IDOL] I played a part,
but it was their will.

268
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,616
"We wish for the Demon Lord

269
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:30,161
to descend upon this
world," they said.

270
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,288
These guys, you mean?

271
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,748
And now they're dead?

272
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,500
So did they summon
Greole here, too,

273
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,502
or was that someone else's idea?

274
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,380
[IDOL] Greole broke the
seal with his own power.

275
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,382
No wish was necessary.

276
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,800
Upon his revival,

277
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,177
he took control of the
surrounding forest

278
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:50,223
and demanded sacrifices from all
the villages in its vicinity.

279
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,225
[KUNAI]
Sacrifices.

280
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,524
[IDOL] These people wished
for the Demon Lord's descent,

281
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,568
but Greole appeared in order
to prevent the summoning.

282
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,113
He slaughtered every
last one of them.

283
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,240
Sorry. That's not my problem.

284
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,908
I need you to send me back!

285
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,701
[IDOL]
I'm afraid I cannot.

286
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,496
That would defy the
last wish that I granted.

287
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:16,416
You're the boss!
Just change the rules!

288
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,584
[IDOL]
I cannot grant your wish,

289
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,753
but seeing as you are
my final visitor,

290
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,922
I shall give you this.

291
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,091
[gasps]

292
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,178
Take it back! It's ugly!

293
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,638
This isn't a gift at all!

294
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,224
You're trying to
punish me, aren't you?

295
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:38,187
[IDOL] I pray that you find
your way home, in due time.

296
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,773
I was once a beautiful
sight to behold‐‐

297
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,608
a symbol of purity.

298
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,278
But many years of granting
wicked wishes to humans

299
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,113
turned me into this.

300
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:53,703
[IDOL] Yet still, I pray
that your wish comes true.

301
00:15:55,538 --> 00:16:00,918
[sighs] Well, got this
stupid ring, but what now?

302
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,420
[footsteps]

303
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,552
[AKU gasps]

304
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:14,724
[AKU] How was it? Did you
have your wish granted?

305
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,143
Did you wish to rule
the world after all?

306
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,896
Or for depravity to
poison the land?

307
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,649
[KUNAI]
Yoga! Yoga!

308
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,901
‐‐[AKU] Ow, ow, ow!
‐‐[KUNAI chuckles]

309
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,320
[AKU]
What did I say wrong? Stop!

310
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:32,116
[KUNAI] Aku, are there any big
cities somewhere in the area?

311
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,326
There's the capital.

312
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,495
Right here in the
Kingdom of Holy Light.

313
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,704
Works for me.

314
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,332
Think you can draw
me a map, maybe?

315
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,334
Please don't leave me!

316
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,212
I mean, do you think you
could take me with you?

317
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,465
Huh? You really wanna
hang out with me?

318
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,634
Well, it would be nice.

319
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,470
I, uh, can't exactly
live in the village now,

320
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,848
since I was cast out
as a sacrifice and all.

321
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,351
[OONO] I know hardly
anything about this world.

322
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,895
Might be handy
having her as a guide.

323
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,774
Heh. I don't mind. Let's go.

324
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:08,027
[gasps] Thank you so much!

325
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,861
If it's all right,

326
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,738
could we go back to my
village for a second

327
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,031
before we set off?

328
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,951
I don't have much, but I'd
like to grab something.

329
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,118
[KUNAI]
That's fine.

330
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,455
Now hop on, and no
complaints this time.

331
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,543
It won't take long with
as fast as you run!

332
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:26,963
[KUNAI]
Question.

333
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,339
If the situation is bad enough

334
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,132
that people are
sacrificing each other,

335
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,842
then why hasn't this
Capital or whatever

336
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,135
done anything to help?

337
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,806
Well, our village is pretty far
away from the Holy Capital, so.

338
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,807
[KUNAI]
I see.

339
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,600
So we're in the
middle of nowhere.

340
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,143
[AKU]
Um, Mister Demon Lord?

341
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,437
Could you tell me about
the place you come from?

342
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,691
Uh, let's just say
it's way out there.

343
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,235
All of the land near my
village was made barren

344
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,070
thanks to a curse from Greole.

345
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:54,740
Even the water underground
is dirty and poisonous.

346
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,075
That's why I was so happy

347
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,953
when I was able to take a
bath in that beautiful lake.

348
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,582
I've never seen such
clean water in my life.

349
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,083
Oh, we're almost there.

350
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,960
It's quiet today.

351
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,545
Just go right in.

352
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,884

00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,949
[KUNAI] Private message
to Aku. Can you hear me?

359
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,201
[AKU] Huh? The mean
voice of the Demon Lord

360
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,870
is echoing in my head!

361
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,539
[KUNAI]
It's gruff and cool! Not mean!

362
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:44,874
Never mind.

363
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,043
Do what you have to do.
I'll be hiding nearby.

364

Um, okay!

[AKU gasps]

366
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,255
I thought the trash
got taken out,

367
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,757
but it looks like it came back!

368
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,760
If I recall, you were
supposed to be a sacrifice!

[VILLAGERS yelling]

you deem unfit to
inhabit this world.

What the hell?

377
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,240
I'll do that in‐game,
not in real life!

378
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,910
[RING]
If you didn't crave that power,

379
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:25,414
why did you create that game,
that world, in the first place?

380
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,667
You made it twisted, rotten,

381
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,919
drowning in death
and destruction.

382
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,004

If I am a fiend who purged

00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,598
over four million
lives from the world,

387
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,266
then what are you?

00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,476
Nothing less than the devil...

00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,311
This's all in my head!

390

Are you're one of

Please, spare our poor village!

00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,709
Wasn't our sacrifice
good enough for you?

Hurry up. Go get
your stuff, Aku.

Um, yes, sir, Demon Lord.

You brought him here?!

Are you trying to kill us,

You're nothing but a plague!

I'll be okay.

I'm not so sure about
the villagers, though.

I was just warmin' up the place.

420

They're probably having
fun with their big bonfire.

421
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,981
Think of it an act of kindness

422
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,609
to spice up their
boring little lives.

Mister Demon Lord?

I don't understand.

425
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,114
Why would you do this
for someone like me?

426
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:23,949
Don't put it that way.

427

And don't let other people tell
you what you're worth, either.

You have to admit, that was fun.

Um, kind of.

an <i>Infinity Game</i>
