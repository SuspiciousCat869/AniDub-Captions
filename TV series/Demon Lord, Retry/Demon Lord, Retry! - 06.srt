00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,852
[MINK] Hey, Organ, do you
think it could really be true

3
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:21,188
that a Dragonkin
showed up in Yahoo?

4
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,191
No, it just seems ridiculous.

5
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:27,110
But you never know. There are
no guarantees in this world.

6
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:30,072
[MINK] I know! Sounds like
some kinda fairy tale.

7
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,116
A Dragonkin taking
a stand against evil.

8
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,618
If there really was one,

9
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,579
the Beast Kingdom would be all
over it, that's for certain.

10
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:38,956
[MINK]
You never know.

11
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,750
Maybe he's a wild
Dragonkin or something.

12
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,418
Don't be absurd.

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,296
Why is the union of Human
and Dragon celebrated,

14
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:47,923
but a Human and Demon?

15
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,592
They're detested and persecuted.

16
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:53,428
What a ridiculous,
illogical world this is.

17
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:57,808
I know the Dragonkin is
great and all, Mink,

18
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,727
but I recommend this one, here.

Hm.

Huh?

21
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,775
[IEI] Check it out. This man is
calling himself "Demon Lord"!

22
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:07,985
So, one thing's for sure.

23
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,152
If you hang out with him,

24
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,698
you can expect to get into
plenty of shenanigans!

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,455
I can feel the waves of
destiny crashing over me!

00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,207
My right eye is throbbing!

29

I can see it! I can see it all!

30
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:25,752
By the hands of that man,

31
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,755
the future of our world
will plunge into chaos!

32
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:29,965
Come on, Organ!

33
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,551
I think we should perform
a blood oath, right here!

34
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:33,927
The coming chaos is going to be

35
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,804
darker than either
of us can imagine!

36

You do know you're a priest.

you talking about?

If I'm not mistaken,

aren't those the S‐Rank
adventurers, Mink and Organ?

40
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,152
It's true the Demon Lord
may be out of our league,

41
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:53,447
but I have a feeling
those two could handle him.

42
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,783
That old man is
mine and mine alone.

43
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,745
Nobody else lays a
hand on the hot Demon.

with a toast to Aku's leg.

[KUNAI] Okay, "repulsive" was
unnecessary, don't you think?

the central figure

for all the wives
of the nobility.

133

She has tons of connections,

134
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,294
and she's hugely influential
amongst the nobles.

135
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,963

you would consider her

the queen of high society?

Yeah, that's right.

Good. I've got an idea.

If I can somehow manage
to gain her trust,

141
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,808
then we'll have an
unbeatable ally.

142
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,017
Which would be invaluable.

your congratulations, as well?

time in the city, little one?

You're such a sweet
and earnest young lady.

Oh, thank you, Madam.

159
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,805
I know. She really is, right?

160
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,682
I'm proud to have
her as my friend!

you're way too kind!

162
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,771
And what do you think about
our city, Mister Demon Lord?

163
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,107
It's truly spectacular.

164
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:47,360
But it's also straightforward
and easy to understand.

165
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,112
Compared to some of
the impoverished lands

166
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,072
I've passed through
on my travels,

167
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:55,035
the Holy Capital's prosperity
is a wonder to behold.

168
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:58,038
[SHRIMPFRY laughs]
You're absolutely correct.

169
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,040
In fact, it's not at all unusual

170
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,791
for one to hear the many
lands of the kingdom

171
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,377
compared to either
Heaven or Hell.

172
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,338
I don't think that could be
any closer to the truth.

173
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,716
However, I believe
there might be a way

174
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,302
to resolve that
troubling disparity.

175
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,098
Well, I would love
to hear your opinion.

176
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,851
You're obviously a wise man.

177
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,813
It's a simple concept, actually.

178
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:27,442
All we have to do is transform
every last land into Heaven.

179
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,278
If we succeed, the country's
problems will evaporate.

180
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,780
It's that easy.

181
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,406
[SHRIMPFRY]
Goodness, this seems like

182
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,742
a rather large‐scale
proposition.

183
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:36,701
Madam, trust me,

184
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,912
if I was sitting at the
head of this kingdom,

185
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,081
I could get it done
within a few short years!

186
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,332

But come, come, enough of these

don't you agree?

189
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,380
Besides, there's
another kind of Heaven

190
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,217
that I'd like to
introduce you to.

191
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,219
That sounds intriguing!

192
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,680
And what exactly is this
"Heaven" you speak of?

193
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,390
[KUNAI]
It's this right here.

194
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,644
Some soap?

195
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:06,189
[LUNA] Oh! That soap is
seriously the best thing, ever!

196
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,774
It washes away dirt like magic

197
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,944
and leaves your skin
so clean it sparkles!

198
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,612
[SHRIMPFRY]
Magic.

199
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,031
Sparkling, huh?

200
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,909
[KUNAI]
Nice assist, Luna!

201

[SHRIMPFRY]
Hm...

202
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,498
[SHRIMPFRY] It's true, the skin
of all these ladies here

203
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,794
is dazzling. There's
no denying that!

204
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,880
I would sincerely urge you
to give it a try tonight.

205
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,298
I think you're going
to be astonished

206
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,259
at how well it actually works.

207
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,677
I may just!

208
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,221
Thank you so much for such a
wonderfully thoughtful gift,

209

210

[KUNAI chuckles]
Oh, please.

211
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,685
There's no need to thank me for
such a trivial thing as that.

212
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,771
But I am planning to open a hot
spring in the village of Rabby

213
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,773
sometime in the
very near future.

214
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,441
Now, that'll be a place

215
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,027
where your entire self
will be entirely revived!

216
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,029
Revived! Well, my goodness!

217
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,782
I appreciate a man
who makes bold claims.

218
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:01,202
You will find that no idea of
mine is lacking in substance.

219
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,913
Not a single one is
ever just for show.

220
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,040
And that's because every word
that comes out of my mouth,

221
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,543
I make into reality.

222
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,504
It won't be just an
ordinary bath, you see.

223
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:15,216
There will be carbon dioxide
baths, vase baths, stone saunas,

224
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,802
electric baths, herbal
baths, salt saunas,

225
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,471
and so much more for
the guests to enjoy!

226
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,682
Not only will it help
exhaustion, stiff muscles,

227
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,268
and cold sensitivity,
but your skin is guaranteed

to feel years younger
when you're done!

from my sister, Oysterfry.

Oh, I'm sorry, Madam.

I guess that means you're still

Although, if I'm remembering
what you said correctly,

maybe that's due
to the fact that
