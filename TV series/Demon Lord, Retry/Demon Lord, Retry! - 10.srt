[EAGLE, LUNA panting]

2
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,562
Quick! We don't wanna
get there late.

3
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:23,065
Please. I can't run any faster.

4
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,108
[LUNA] Try. There isn't
gonna be any bread left

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,276
if we don't hurry.

6
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,654
That doesn't change how
fast I can run, y'know.

7
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,698
[LUNA giggles]
I think we can even afford

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,575
the good stuff today.

9
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:34,743
Yeah!

10
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,956
[LUNA]
It's so frustrating.

11
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,332
[EAGLE]
Huh?

12
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,213
Someday, I'll eat here
whenever I want to,

13
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:48,131
and no one will tell me "no."

14
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,132
Oh, come on.

15
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:52,636
Even you must know
that's impossible, Luna.

16
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:55,138
You're such a quitter.
How do you expect to win

17
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,766
if you give up before
the fight even starts?

18
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,435
We're not all as
stubborn as you are.

19
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,274
‐‐[BOTH] Huh?
‐‐[NOBLE 10A] What's this?

20
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,401
It appears a pair of
filthy street rats

21
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,570
are wandering where
they don't belong.

22
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,821
[NOBLE 10B]
At least use the bridge

23
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,574
so we're spared the sight
of your disgusting faces.

24
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,908
[LUNA growls]

25
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,743
Hmph. Just look.

26
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,912
It even snarls like a rat does.

27
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,748
Indeed, and it
smells like one, too.

28
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,460
The foul odor is making
me sick to my stomach.

29
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,713
Don't do it, Luna!

30
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,215
You're going to regret this.

31
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,342
Look, the rat can speak.

32
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,136
[LUNA] I've been studying,
and when I'm older,

33
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,263
I'm going to join
the Holy Church.

34
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:37,431
I'll become a Holy Maiden.

35
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,265
[gasps]

36
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,600
[LUNA]
And once I do,

37
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,811
I'll make you regret every
word you said to us today.

38
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,730
Have you lost your mind, girl?

39
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,481
Speaking to us like that‐‐

40
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,774
[LUNA]
Now, gentlemen.

41
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,568
I'd like your names, please.

42
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,529
[NOBLE 10A chuckles]
As if I would introduce myself

43
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,573
to garbage like you.

44
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:55,907
Hey, calm down.

45
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,119
You made your point.
They're leaving.

46
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:02,205
[LUNA] I refuse to lose
to people like that.

47
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,833
They'll see.

48
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,669
All of my hard work
will pay off one day.

49
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,650
[MESSENGER 10A]
Luna Elegant.

50
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:57,487
You have faithfully abided by
the teachings of the Cherub.

51
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,906
Putting into practice the
knowledge you've obtained

52
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:03,410
and are an age at which your
studies may begin in earnest.

53
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:06,455
As of today, you will officially
enter the Holy Church,

54
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,958
and train to become worthy of
being named "Holy Maiden."

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,834
Thank you.

56
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,587
It is an honor to accept.

57
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,838
Rise.

58
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,800
I would like to bring
my servant with me.

59
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,094
Perhaps you're aware?

60
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,137
Yes.

61
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:26,141
Well, it makes sense you'd
research Maiden candidates.

62
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,893
But I'm afraid the
servant you speak of

63
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,603
is no longer among us.

64
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,439
The execution's
been carried out.

65
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,982
[gasps]

66
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,989
[MESSENGER 10A] Your companion
was, in fact, a demihuman.

67
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,741
To think that such
a creature could

68
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,659
infiltrate the Holy Capital.

69
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,621
A‐‐ A demihuman?

70
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,122
No. Please wait!

71
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:52,083
Eagle never hurt
anybody, I swear.

72
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,670
Being a demihuman
is a sin in itself.

73
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,715
Are you or are you not striving
to become a Holy Maiden

74
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,884
of the Church one day?

75
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,427
[LUNA]
I am, but...

76
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,639
[MESSENGER 10A] In that case, I
would advise being more careful

77
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,391
with whom you
choose to associate.

78
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,855
[LUNA]
Eagle's dead.

79
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,649
The Holy Church says
that demihumans

80
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,651
can never be accepted.

81
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,862
And how can I go
against its teachings?

82
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,743
[LUNA] Two years later,
I became a Holy Maiden.

83
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,496
They allowed me to use "Light"
and even "Golden" magic

84
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,249
because they saw
my aptitude for it.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,711
[LUNA] I was appointed to Rabby,
an impoverished village

86
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,090
inhabited by Bunnies who
were blessed by the Cherub.

87
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,888
[LUNA] If I'd been in
a position of power,

88
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,723
maybe I could have
found a home for Eagle

89
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,392
in a village like this,

90
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,645
and my friend would
still be alive.

91
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:57,274
O Cherub, please give me power.

92
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,361
[KUNAI]
Luna. Luna.

93
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,445
[gasps]

94
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,363
[LUNA]
Cherub?

95
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,823
[gasps]

96
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,032
[KUNAI]
Not quite.

97
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,535
Somebody's been
sleeping on the job.

98
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,580
Now, can you hear me? Luna?

99
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,665
[LUNA]
Oh, it was just Demon Lord.

100
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,542
Yes. I'm here.

101
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,836
What do you need?

102
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,588
[KUNAI]
What do you think I need?

103
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,714
I'm with Madam.

104
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,716
We're heading your
way, as planned.

105
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,926
Are you ready for us?

106
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,553
[LUNA]
Of course I'm ready, silly!

107
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:27,804
I was born ready!

108
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,723
"Ready" is my middle name!

109
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,976
[KUNAI] I see. Then obviously
I was just imagining you

110
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,811
talking in your sleep before.

111
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,479
[LUNA]
I don't know what you mean.

112
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,857
[LUNA chuckles]

113
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,358
[KUNAI]
Whatever you say.

114
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,776
I'm counting on you, Luna.

115
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,445
[LUNA]
You've got it!

116
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,408
Madam, you are about to
behold the main attraction

117
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,118
of our hot springs resort.

118
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,953
I've already witnessed
a man's eyesight

119
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,080
being miraculously
restored to him.

120
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:57,125
What other surprises do
you have in store for me?

121
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,128
Well, you'll see
for yourself soon.

122
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,423
What took you so long?

123
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,760
You slow poke! [giggles]

124
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,095
Come on! Hurry!

125
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,640
Goodness. You're even
pushier than usual.

126
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,808
What's gotten into you today?

127
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,019
[KUNAI] I'll leave you
ladies to it, then.

128
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,980
I hope you have a
relaxing experience.

129
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,899
I'm sure I will.

130
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,150
[LUNA]
Keep going, Madam.

131
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,944
We're almost there.

132
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,697
[LUNA]
Welcome to the public baths!

133
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,040
[SHRIMPFRY] You're telling me
this entire area is for bathing?

134
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,753
[LUNA]
Let's start by rinsing off.

135
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,339
My! Some sort of magic?

136
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,675
What is this contraption?

137
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,927
A shower. Nice, huh?

138
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,931
Please allow me to
wash your back, hop.

139
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,976
[SHRIMPFRY]
I've never felt so clean before.

140
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,269
It's like dirt I didn't
even know was there

141
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,438
is being washed away.

142
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,316
[LUNA] I know! Now that
I know what it's like,

143
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,735
I don't think I could
live without it!

144
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,531
I would be happy to
wash your hair, bunny.

145
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,912
[sighs]

146
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,623
We'll get you started
with a cleansing shampoo.

147
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,084
Then, after that, we'll
apply some conditioner

148
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,421
to moisturize your scalp and
repair the damage, bunny.

149
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,803
This is wonderful.

150
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,015
We could call it a day
now, and I'd be happy.

151
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,267
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Madam.

152
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,269
I haven't even begun
to show off my‐‐

153
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,603
I mean, that is,

154
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,481
there's still so much more
for you to experience here.

155
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,400
Just as self‐centered as ever.

156
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,111
I'm glad to see you
haven't changed.

157
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,154
Enough of this.

158
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,488
We're moving on now.

159
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,198
Coming, dear.

160
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,536
Well, what do you
think of this, Madam?

161
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:59,164
It's called a
carbon dioxide bath.

162
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,417
There's certainly something
peculiar about this water.

163
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,253
It's so strange.

164
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,005
But so good!

165
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,715
My body feels light and free,

166
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,342
like I could almost
float up into the sky.

167
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,428
Yep! And there's more!

168
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,138
Splash a little
water on your face

169
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,057
and tell me what you notice.

170
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,102
So smooth.

171
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,271
It's like a baby's bottom.

172
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,898
We're just warming up.

173
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,734
You ready to try the next one?

174
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,861
[SHRIMPFRY]
Oh! Slow down, Luna.

175
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,572
Running like this
is hardly dignified.

176
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,119
This one is the herbal bath.

177
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,622
What does the scent
remind you of?

178
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,041
It's a vibrant, woodsy aroma.

179
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,294
If I closed my eyes, I would
think we were in a forest.

180
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,257
Pretty amazing, right?

181
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,094
I don't know how he did it.

182
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,472
[SHRIMPFRY chuckles]
Oh, I see.

183
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,266
You sound like a woman
very much in love, Luna.

184
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,435
[gasps] In love?

185
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,771
What‐‐?!

186
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,397
What are you talking about?

187
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,525
No use pretending, dear.

188
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,901
I can see right through you.

189
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,529
You're positively smitten
with the Demon Lord.

190
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,738
That's ridiculous, Madam!

191
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,908
I'm not smitten with anyone,
certainly not that guy!

192
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,037
I hate to tell you this, but
he'll be a tricky one to catch.

193
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,540
You've certainly got your
work cut out for you.

194
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,999
I'm afraid your feminine charms

195
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,710
leave something to
be desired, dear.

196
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,714
Uh, okay, let's just move on
to the next room, shall we?

197
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,218
[SHRIMPFRY]
Why are you in such a hurry?

198
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,431
[LUNA] All right.
This is called a salt sauna.

199
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,935
Get ready to experience
the wonders of exfoliation!

200
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,229
Salt, huh?

201
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,731
[LUNA] First, you sit in
the heat for a few moments,

202
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,942
let a little bit
of sweat build up,

203
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,735
and then... See?

204
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,071
Gently rub the salt
into your skin.

205
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,698
We'll wait for a bit,

206
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,076
and then we'll wash it
all off in the shower.

207
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,953
Repeat as needed!

208
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,248
[SHRIMPFRY]
And it works?

209
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,332
Like a charm.

210
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,002
I did this yesterday,
and it was amazing.

211
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,962
I could practically
see the excess skin

212
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,256
falling right off my body.

213
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,259
See, the salt scrubs away
the outer layer of skin,

214
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,429
revealing a smoother
layer underneath!

215
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,599
I think it even toned my stomach
and thighs up a bit, too.

216
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,185
[SHRIMPFRY gasping]

217
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,479
Um, is something
the matter, Madam?

218
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,816
[SHRIMPFRY gasping]

219
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,318
[shrieks]

220
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:37,530
[SHRIMPFRY]
Hell yeah!

221
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,574
What‐‐ What's wrong?

222
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,911
Luna, dear. I've
made up my mind.

223
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,204
You have?

224
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,763
[WHITE] Madam Shrimpfry went to
Rabby Village for a vacation?

225
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,806
First he managed to lure
in our little sister,

226
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:07,018
and now he's sunk his devious
claws into Madam, as well?

227
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,148
[WHITE]
Queen, look at this!

228
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,235
So, a vacation, huh?

229
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,986
We care why?

230
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:17,987
[WHITE]
Because!

231
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,406
This is a significant
development.

232
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,700
It means he's making progress.

233
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,079
The Demon Lord's won
Madam to his side somehow.

234
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,081
[KILLER QUEEN]
What is your deal with this guy?

235
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,165
Come on, Sis.

236
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:32,669
He's just a shiny new toy
for Luna to play with.

237
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,089
[WHITE] Why aren't you
taking this more seriously?

238
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,258
[groans] 'Cause I saw
how our shithead sister

239
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,134
was acting in Yahoo.

240
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,302
I mean, wow.

241
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:44,847
It was almost sad how hard
the poor thing was trying.

242
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,351
That idiot is head
over heels in love.

243
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,936
In love with the Demon Lord?

244
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,981
That man is a threat
to our entire kingdom.

245
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:57,026
[scoffs] Can't say I'm surprised
that you don't understand.

246
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,862
Well, hopefully love
will find you someday.

247
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,865
I'll even pray for you
like a good Holy Maiden.

248
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,994
I have no use for your
sarcasm or your pity.

249
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,122
We need to have a
serious conversation.

250
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,292
O great holy someone
way up in heaven.

251
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,043
Yeah, I'm kinda
wingin' it, here.

252
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:17,338
I pray my big sister
isn't always unwanted.

253
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,383
One more thing.

254
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,676
My Zero.

255
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,762
Just let him know
that I love him.

256
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,765
I'm sensing this prayer
wasn't really for me.

257
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,142
Hell no.

258
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,269
You're just gonna admit it?

259
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,988
Oh, it's only you.

260
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,991
"Only"? Show a little respect.

261
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,701
I've been working hard
since this morning,

262
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,244
I'll have you know.

263
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,581
Is that a map of the village?

264
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,625
The facilities look like they've
been placed differently.

265
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,086
[TAHARA]
Yeah. That's 'cause they have.

266
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,589
[YU]
I see. Do you have a problem

267
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,883
with the way the chief
chose to arrange them?

268
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:05,345
Well, sometimes things
change and we need to adapt.

269
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,181
And not that you asked, but I
have the chief's permission

270
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,224
to shift the buildings around.

271
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,727
Oh. Looks great, then.

272
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,605
Gotta say,
you sure have changed.

273
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:19,150
Don't remember you being this
devoted to the chief before.

274
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,111
Like all you care about
is pleasing him.

275
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,363
It's strange.

276
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,115
The guy's not exactly
a spring chicken.

277
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,160
[TAHARA]
And the last time I checked,

278
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,997
your tastes ran in a
different direction.

279
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,709
There are all those bunnies
running around here, too.

280
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,795
[YU]
Hmm. I don't know why,

281
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,213
but lately all I can think about

282
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,298
is the chief and
making him happy.

283
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,966
Hey, you do you.

284
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,010
[TAHARA]
Please, stay like this.

285
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:50,598
A reasonably normal human
being, for all our sakes.

286
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,849
Looking at this,

287
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,685
it seems like you've got
a lot of changes in mind.

288
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,187
[TAHARA]
Yeah, kinda.

289
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,023
I was thinking about dividing
the village into sections

290
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,192
that serve different purposes.

291
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,360
Ya know what I mean?

292
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,071
There'd be a medical
section, a business section,

293
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:08,408
a visitors' section,
and a Bunny section.

294
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,536
A big revamp like
this one is gonna cost.

295
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,954
[TAHARA]
About that.

296
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,747
We'd be exchanging
your holy coin thing

297
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,625
for all the supplies
and labor we need.

298
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:21,254
Really? I'm so glad I could
contribute something.

299
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,673
[TAHARA] Totally. You shoulda
heard how happy the chief was,

300
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,384
talking about all the money
you're gonna bring in.

301
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,432
[TAHARA] Please, stay
like this. Just like this.

302
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,101
Seriously, I'm begging you.

303
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,103
But you know, Tahara.

304
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,231
If you're going to change
things up this drastically,

305
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,900
you might ask Madam
for some suggestions.

306
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,861
Not a chance.

307
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,739
Listen, think of this
place as our castle.

308
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,659
Madam gets no say in what we do.

309
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,453
This is our territory.

310
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,872
Some noble's not
calling the shots.

311
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,416
That'd set a
dangerous precedent.

312
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,460
Got it?

313
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,129
You say something
like that again,

314
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,672
I'll kill you.

315
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,551
Remember the Nightless
City incident.

316
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,597
I'm sorry.

317
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,557
It was a careless remark.

318
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,060
[TAHARA] Chief's planning to
go in the opposite direction

319
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,479
of the Great Empire.

320
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,606
I'm sure he told you that, too.

321
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,607
[YU]
He did.

322
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,402
According to him, going down
a well‐beaten path is boring.

323
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,530
Tell me, how do you
feel about that?

324
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,159
The thing is, Tahara,

325
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,661
I was touched by
the world fault.

326
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,998
Oh, great, there you go
again with the crazy talk.

327
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,958
[YU]
What's more, I've begun feeling

328
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,711
the presence of God
within the chief.

329
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,216
Okay, now you've really lost it.

330
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,592
Good one.

331
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,302
Whatja used to say?

332
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,347
Something about "unlocking
the body's mysteries"?

333
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,098
Is this the new
wacky catchphrase

334
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,351
you've decided to go with?

335
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,394
[YU]
No, it's not.

336
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:04,065
As time goes on,
that feeling only gets stronger.

337
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,652
Surely you can sense the
truth, too, if only vaguely.

338
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,870
I'm not quite sure
why we're doing this

339
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,330
when I'm perfectly healthy.

340
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,832
Because everyone needs
regular checkups

341
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,335
to make sure their bodies
are functioning properly.

342
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,503
What if there is something wrong

343
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,547
and you simply don't
realize it yet?

344
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,340
Okay, that's fair enough.

345
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,259
You have a point.

346
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:36,681
[panting]

347
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,183
Yeah, actually,
I think I'm gonna go.

348
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,979
Promise I'll come by if I get
so much as a sniffle, though.

349
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,481
‐‐Sorry.
‐‐But you mustn't go, Chief.

350
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,858
You examination isn't over yet.

351
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,695
You might have a fever.

352
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:55,116
Your chest is so hot,
and so hard, and so smooth.

353
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,284
[YU gasps]
Chief!

354
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,910
Really, I'm done.

355
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,538
I've got pressing business
matters to see to.

356
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,415
I'm sure there's
nothing wrong with me.

357
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,042
Boo! No fair.

358
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,422
[YU gasps]

359
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,530
[sighs] This is the life.

360
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,075
Ha, ha. There's
nothing quite like

361
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,661
an outdoor bath in
a fantasy world.

362
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,872
[TRON]
I finally found you.

363
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,498
[KUNAI]
Dammit, runt!

364
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,917
What the hell are
you doing out here?

365
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,669
You deserve to be
pampered a little,

366
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:52,673
so let me wash that long hair
of yours while you relax.

367
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,342
Would you get out of here, runt?

368
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,177
This is the men's bath!

369
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,970
Stop calling me a runt.

370
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,264
Use my name for once.

371
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,017
If the others saw you out here,

372
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,977
they'd never let me
hear the end of it.

373
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,437
Leave already!

374
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,939
You're not even wearing a towel.

375
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,360
I don't have a problem with
Zero seeing me like this.

376
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,986
I am not Zero!

377
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:17,156
And don't ever call me
that with people around!

378
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,617
[TRON]
Uh...

379
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,328
All right.

380
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,790
If that's what Zero wants, this
will just be our little secret.

381
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,458
[KUNAI]
Enough about Zero.

382
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,710
Come on. I'm getting
you out of here.

383
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,925
[TRON]
Oh, my.

384
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,642
Well, it's no real surprise
the TV doesn't work.

385
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,272
[OONO] If this were the
same as <i>Infinity Game</i>,

386
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,108
the dining room would
be fully stocked,

387
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,318
and steamed buns would
automatically appear

388
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,820
in the guest rooms.

389
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,033
[OONO] I guess we're out of luck
as far as food is concerned.

390
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,536
[OONO]
The toiletries all seem to be

391
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,538
replenishing on
their own, though,

392
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,624
so I guess that's
something, at least.

393
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,961
[door opens, closes]

394
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:16,173
[AKU humming]

395
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,883
Demon Lord!

396
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:21,053
You weren't kidding about how
incredible this resort would be.

397
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,389
Really. It's perfect. All of it!

398
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,307
Glad you're enjoying
yourself, Aku.

399
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,811
Today I got to try something
called an herbal bath.

400
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,357
Now that you mention it,
you do smell fresh and herby.

401
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,110
[AKU]
I do? Really?

402
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,446
Guess you're sleeping
with me again.

403
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,281
[sighs]

404
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,411
[footsteps]

405
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,537
[LUNA]
Aku!

406
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,374
You were supposed to be my
snuggle buddy tonight, remember?

407
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,335
Hey, keep your voice down.
She's already asleep.

408
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,379
You filthy, rotten pervert!

409
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,840
What exactly are
you up to in here?

410
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,551
I don't know what kind of gross
stuff you might be imagining,

411
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:04,180
but I'm trying to get some sleep
after a long day of work.

412
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,016
[gasps]

413
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,981
[LUNA]
Fine. You leave me no choice.

414
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:17,234
I'll have to sleep in here
and keep an eye on you.

415
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,863
This might be the softest bed
I've ever felt in my life.

416
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,698
I'm never leaving.

417
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,367
[LUNA gasps]

418
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,203
Hey! Hands to yourself!

419
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,414
You totally tried to grab my
butt just now, didn't you?

420
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,208
How many times do I
have to tell you:

421
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,586
I have no interest in
grabbing your butt.

422
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,671
There's no use denying it.

423
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,507
Clearly, I'll have
to keep a watch on

424
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,091
this naughty hand of yours.

425
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,302
[KUNAI]
Come on.

426
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:46,472
[sighs] It doesn't make
a very good pillow.

427
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:49,225
It's all hard, and I can
feel your veins throbbing.

428
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,810
[KUNAI]
I know you could have found

429
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,978
a better way to phrase that.

430
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,738
[AKU]
Demon Lord!

431
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,865
[KUNAI] Huh? Your voice
sounds weird, Aku.

432
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:28,741
You got a cold?

433
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,493
[LUNA] Ugh, mine sounds
all funny, too.

434
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,661
[TRON]
Same here.

435
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:35,497
[KUNAI] Hold on, why are
you all dressed like boys?

436
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,749
[YU]
It's your turn, Chief!

437
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,876
I have the perfect
outfit for you.

438
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:42,296
Please just give it chance.
You're going to look so cute!

439
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,965
So cute! So cute!
So cute! So cute!

440
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,216
[OONO]
So cute!

441
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,135
Wait, what was that dream?

442
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:51,180
[KUNAI] Next time:
<i>Demon Lord, Retry</i> Episode 11.

443
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,474
"Yukikaze Attacks."
