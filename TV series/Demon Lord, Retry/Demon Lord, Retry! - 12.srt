1
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,312
[WHITE]
It's you?

2
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:47,357
[KUNAI]
Mm? Hello there.

3
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,902
Seems our humble resort
has an exalted visitor.

4
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,079
[WHITE]
What is this?

5
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,125
Did you and your minions
arrange for an ambush?

6
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,838
The tranquility of this
outdoor bath is a sacred thing.

7
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,965
The only people who would
ever cause trouble here

8
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,675
are children who
don't know any better

9
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,178
and uncivilized fools.

10
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,096
And I would like to
believe you don't fall into

11
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,140
either of those two groups.

12
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,686
[OONO]
I need to calm down!

13
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:27,022
If I do something that
inadvertently makes her scream,

14
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,440
and someone hears it,

15
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:31,568
my name and reputation
will be destroyed!

16
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,279
It's like riding on a
crowded train, for example.

17
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,531
Why is it that,
for no damn reason at all,

18
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,867
people automatically assume
that if you're a man,

19
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,036
you have to be a bad guy?

20
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,749
[sighs]

21
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,210
[OONO] They can't throw me
in jail for something stupid

22
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,796
like ogling a
Holy Maiden, can they?

23
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,547
That'd be ridiculous.

24
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,053
[OONO]
Shit!

25
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,305
Why can't I just take a bath
without some kind of trouble

26
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,849
following me into the water?

27
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,228
What's a Holy Maiden doing
in this village, anyway?

28
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,231
And in the men's bath,
of all places?

29
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:14,861
[OONO] Oh, no! Could this
be some kind of honey trap?

30
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,821
Wait.

31
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,074
Even if they had set a trap
for me like that somehow,

32
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,909
there's no way a woman
who's considered

33
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,494
the pinnacle of the kingdom

34
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,038
would lower herself
to participate.

35
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,082
If you've traveled all
this way to find me,

36
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:31,128
then I assume it concerns some
matter of great importance.

37
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,462
And, believe it or not,

38
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:36,091
I am actually willing to
lend you an open ear.

39
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,801
A matter of importance?

40
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,302
I'm here because of
what you've done to my‐‐

41
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,221
Before we go there,

42
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:44,349
I find your appearance
incredibly vexing.

43
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,434
[WHITE gasps]

44
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,228
[KUNAI] I recommend you
cover up with this.

45
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,031
[WHITE gasps]
Wait!

46
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,242
Are you saying you were
staring at me naked?

47
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,702
[KUNAI]
How about you just go ahead

48
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,871
and get into the
bath already, okay?

49
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,831
You're a very important person.

50
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:11,251
If you were to catch a cold,
the whole kingdom would suffer.

51
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,633
[WHITE]
Why?

52
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,595
This is the first time a
man has ever seen me naked.

53
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:25,390
And on top of that, he said
my appearance was vexing!

54
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,894
[KUNAI]
Now, then, let's hear about this

55
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,979
important of business of yours.

56
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,190
[WHITE]
So, what is he saying?

57
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,109
That my naked body isn't
even worth looking at?

58
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,946
Well, Demon Lord,
it's bad enough that Mada...

59
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,115
[WHITE gasps]

60
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:45,076
[sighs] What's wrong
now, Holy Maiden?

61
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,328
I mean,

62
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,206
it can't be that the
representative of your kingdom

63
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,250
would be so adorably coy,
as to get flustered

64
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,961
by the mere sight of a man
in the nude, could it?

65
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,797
[OONO] No, it's fine.
It doesn't matter.

66
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,840
Who cares, right? No biggie.

67
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,550
It isn't like seeing a naked man

68
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:04,304
is some crime of indecency
or anything, right?

69
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,056
[WHITE]
And this is the first time

70
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,099
I've ever seen a naked man, too.

71
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,602
Why did it have to be the
Demon Lord, of all people?

72
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:14,147
The epitome of evil right here
in the bath with me, naked!

73
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,858
U‐Uh... Oh?

74
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,860
Why, yes, you are
also in the nude.

75
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,112
Well, seeing you that way
means nothing at all to me.

76
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,782
I'm relieved to hear that.

77
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,494
This means we can converse
calmly without any awkwardness.

78
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,996
All right, then.
So what are you trying to do?

79
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,207
Deceive Madam and
upset the kingdom?

80
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:36,503
Well, there you go, bringing up
deception and making it awkward.

81
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:37,921
To set the record straight,

82
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,090
both Madam and Luna wish
to stay in the village

83
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,175
of their own free will.

84
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:46,054
I am not forcing anyone to do
anything they don't want to do.

85
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,644
Give me one reason why
I should believe you.

86
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,645
I'm waiting!

87
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,815
I would appreciate it if you
came no closer than you are.

88
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,359
I can't help but find your
body rather stimulating,

89
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,735
if you must know.

90
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,363
Uh‐‐How much more do
you plan to insult me?

91
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:06,491
Will you not be satisfied
until you bring me to tears?

92
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,827
You misunderstand me.

93
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,497
I was being utterly sincere when
I said to keep your distance.

94
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,834
I'm not in the business
of telling lies, you know.

95
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,336
[WHITE]
You expect me to believe you're

96
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,381
telling the truth right now?

97
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:24,301
I can show you why
Madam chooses to stay.

98
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:28,763
A quick soak in this bath should
answer that question for you.

99
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:32,601
How can taking a bath
answer anything at all?

100
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,477
[KUNAI]
Why don't you just relax

101
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,147
and get in up to your
shoulders, at least?

102
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,700
[OONO]
That's better.

103
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,786
Focus hard enough and you
can ignore any distraction.

104
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,830
My mind is a blank slate.

105
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,665
I'm filled with nothingness.

106
00:06:55,707 --> 00:07:00,003
[gasps] This bath is just so...

107
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,881
Ah! My shoulders!

108
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,799
[gasping]

109
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,385
[OONO]
Hey, quit with the sexy sounds!

110
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,804
And stop using that
cute voice, will ya?

111
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:14,726
[panting]

112
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,978
What's happening right now?

113
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,441
This is a total first
for me! [gasps]

114
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:25,028
[OONO] Gah! You're
torturing me on purpose!

115
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,950
[KUNAI]
This outdoor bath is great.

116
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,077
It helps with more
than just exhaustion.

117
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,162
It also has the power
to set you free from

118
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,414
the pressures of
your everyday life.

119
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,666
You can forget all your troubles

120
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,918
and get a momentary
sense of release.

121
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,003
It's highly restorative
and can help you get your

122
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,340
strength and vitality back,
so you can face another day.

123
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:49,678
Sets you free from
life's pressures?

124
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,680
[KUNAI] The pleasant
feeling you're experiencing

125
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,058
in this water is the
answer to everything.

126
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,062
Oh. Are you saying that I
should drink that beverage?

127
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,564
[KUNAI] Are you really so
frightened of the Demon Lord

128
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,234
that you'd refuse
my hospitality?

129
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,902
You are the pinnacle
of the kingdom,

130
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,738
and this display of
cowardice and over‐caution

131
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,740
might be one of the
reasons this land is in

132
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,702
such terrible disarray,
don't you think?

133
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,996
[gasps] You have no
right to speak to me

134
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,039
in such a disrespectful manner!

135
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,501
Besides, if you believe that
you can poison me so easily,

136
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,961
you're mistaken.

137
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,713
Angel's Spoon.

138
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,760
[KUNAI] If you ask me, the worst
poison in this entire kingdom

139
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:33,430
is the people who are
in charge of running it.

140
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,935
[KUNAI] They don't care about
the poor and hungry masses

141
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,603
living their miserable lives.

142
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,605
They just turn
their backs on them.

143
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,150
They don't lift a finger
to address the problem,

144
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,943
nor do they feel the
need to develop a plan

145
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,654
to offer aid to the
people who suffer.

146
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:55,076
In my country,
we call people like this

147
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,786
incompetent despots.

148
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,621
[gasps]

149
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,707
[WHITE]
I can't even argue.

150
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,795
Well, from your perspective,

151
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,506
I can see how it
might seem that way.

152
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,260
Witnessing a young woman in my
position spinning her wheels.

153
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,804
It must appear so absurd.

154
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:18,016
[OONO] Her beauty alone could
stop men dead in their tracks‐‐

155
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,018
like some femme fatale.

156
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,437
Although, I guess in this world,

157
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,899
they'd probably just
call her an angel.

158
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,817
[sighs]

159
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,446
[WHITE gasps]

160
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,990
This is a popular drink
from my country.

161
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,327
It's been beloved by my
people for centuries now.

162
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,666
[gasps] Indirect...

163
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,710
Were you going to
say indirect kiss?

164
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:46,836
What are you, a child?

165
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,589
Only a young girl would
say something so immature.

166
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,424
[WHITE]
I hope you can forgive me.

167
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,760
Yeah, I'm kinda wingin' it here.

168
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:57,013
I pray my big sister
isn't always unwanted.

169
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:01,768
I'm sorry for being so immature.

170
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,686
But so what? I am young, y'know?

171
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:08,358
Hold on. I'm not saying acting
young is bad, or anything.

172
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,570
In fact, women who seem innocent
are typically really popular.

173
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,198
I think you should be
proud of who you are.

174
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,866
[WHITE]
What? How could I ever be proud

175
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,284
of something like that?

176
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,204
You're sitting there ridiculing
and laughing at me for it!

177
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,456
I'm not ridiculing you at all.

178
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,918
I mean, I for one find
your stubbornness impressive.

179
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,545
[WHITE] I'm sick and
tired of hearing about

180
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,046
how hard‐headed I am!

181
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,966
Don't treat me like I'm
some intractable brat!

182
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,176
[OONO]
Gah! I walked into a minefield!

183
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,679
There's no saving my ass now!

184
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,722
So, it's come to this.

185
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,520
Huh? What in the world is that?

186
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:49,023
Because you have upheld
the Holy Maiden name,

187
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,861
I would be honored to
bestow this upon you.

188
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,195
[WHITE gasps]

189
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,658
[KUNAI]
I only ask that you never

190
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,660
bring shame upon this halo.

191
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:04,122
And please remember:
I am not your enemy.

192
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,456
[gasps]

193
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,883
[WHITE]
Huh?

194
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,634
An Angel's Halo?

195
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,262
Why would the
Demon Lord have this?

196
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,321
[OONO] I just need to get Her
Holy Maiden‐ness home safely

197
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,740
and I can go about my business.

198
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,824
[KUNAI]
Hm?

199
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,744
[OONO]
She's still wearing it?

200
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,121
Well, I guess it suits her.

201
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,123
Holy Maiden White.

202
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:50,210
Did you travel here from
the Holy Capital by carriage?

203
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,920
No, I didn't.

204
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,255
You came alone, then?

205
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,882
That's right.

206
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,927
[WHITE] I can't speak of the
Seraph's Miracles to anyone,

207
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,388
and certainly not to a man who
may be a threat to the kingdom.

208
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:08,394
Very well. Then, please allow
me to escort you back home.

209
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,688
Huh? That won't be necessa‐‐

210
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,732
[WHITE gasps]
Excuse me.

211
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,276
I'm not entirely
comfortable with this.

212
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,280
I promise, there's
no need to worry.

213
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,824
Just relax and leave
everything to me.

214
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,951
"Just relax"?

215
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,328
Will you please
explain what's go‐‐

216
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,038
Quiet, now.

217
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,042
It would be best if you remained
silent for what I'm about to do.

218
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:34,128
O Wings, carry me
far from this place.

219
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,547
Instant Movement: Holy Castle.

220
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,930
[WHITE] That transported us
just like Seraph's Bound would.

221
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,265
A Miracle!

222
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,559
That had to be the
work of an angel.

223
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,688
What are you, exactly?

224
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,441
Do you remember what I said
to you the last time we met?

225
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,443
About how seeing
something in person

226
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,655
is always better than
having it explained to you?

227
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,534
[gasps]

228
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,787
You confronted me, and I
returned you home safely.

229
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:11,708
I'll let you assess my actions
and draw your own conclusions.

230
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,584
But just so we're clear,

231
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,380
you're to tell no one
about what happened today.

232
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,299
Of course.

233
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,718
[WHITE] Even if he hadn't
warned me not to,

234
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,637
I wouldn't dare speak
of this to anybody.

235
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,265
[WHITE]
News of what he did

236
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,643
might well plunge the
entire kingdom into chaos.

237
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,854
That a Miracle left
behind by the Seraph

238
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,273
could be used by somebody else.

239
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,900
[WHITE]
That there exists a person

240
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,403
who can bestow a
halo upon others,

241
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:43,489
when it was believed that
only angels could wear them.

242
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,866
I don't understand.

243
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,909
Who in the world are you?

244
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:50,413
[KUNAI] Hmm. I suppose I'd
say I'm someone who's hoping

245
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,957
he can count on your
cooperation in the future.

246
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,501
As I mentioned before, I'd like
to learn more about the Seraph,

247
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,004
and I think you can
help me with that.

248
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,757
Okay, but why the Seraph?

249
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,717
Because, you see,

250
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,596
I was called here by the Ophan.

251
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,849
The Ophan summoned you?

252
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,225
[WHITE]
If that's actually true

253
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,852
and not part of
some devious plot,

254
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,937
it would explain so much!

255
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,440
[WHITE]
That could be why Luna is drawn

256
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,068
so strongly to someone
like the Demon Lord,

257
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,028
despite her deep
devotion to the Cherub

258
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,198
and her utterly
self‐centered nature.

259
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,742
And why strong‐willed
Madam left the interior

260
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,994
in favor of Rabby Village.

261
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:36,167
[WHITE] And how he can use a
Miracle, just like the Seraph.

262
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,379
It explains why he can give
someone an Angel's Halo

263
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,256
when such a thing
should be impossible.

264
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:47,011
[WHITE] And that mysterious
building with the sacred baths.

265
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,101
I must know.

266
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,896
Do you seek information because
you mean to oppose the Seraph?

267
00:14:56,938 --> 00:15:01,109
I assure you that is
not my intention.

268
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,987
There are just a few questions
I would like to have answered.

269
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,823
[WHITE gasps]

270
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:10,159
I‐I, uh...

271
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:13,371
[KUNAI]
Hmm, nice.

272
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,414
Perfect.

273
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,959
I suspected an Angel's Halo
would look good on you.

274
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,378
[gasps]

275
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,255
[KUNAI]
Let's meet again.

276
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,089
[WHITE gasps]

277
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,799
[KUNAI]
Holy Maiden White!

278
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,312
[WHITE]
Lucifer.

279
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:43,317
According to legend, he was a
fallen angel and a demon lord.

280
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,446
[WHITE]
An Angel's Halo.

281
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,990
Something sacred and beautiful.

282
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,827
Surely, the one who made this
couldn't be an evil being.

283
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,252
[WHITE] Someday, I'll help
you revert to the angel

284
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,212
you truly are.

285
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,977
[AKU] Demon Lord,
I was looking for you!

286
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,520
Found me.

287
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,189
It's good to see you.

288
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,945
Listen, Aku.

289
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,989
You really need to
be more careful.

290
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:33,367
You can't go around sitting
on men's laps all the time.

291
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,495
You're just so
innocent and trusting,

292
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,622
and frankly, it's going
to worry me sick.

293
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,664
[AKU]
That shouldn't be hard.

294
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:42,376
I don't even think about getting
close to other men besides you.

295
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,794
[KUNAI]
Oh, really?

296
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,671
I guess it's fine, then.

297
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:46,881
Yeah!

298
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:47,882
[KUNAI chuckles]

299
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,885
[AKU giggles]

300
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,387
[AKU] I heard you're
taking a trip tomorrow.

301
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,889
Going up north.

302
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,641
[KUNAI]
You heard right.

303
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,061
But I can always use Instant
Movement if I need to.

304
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,104
A trip I can return
from at any time

305
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,690
can hardly be called
a trip, can it?

306
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,108
True.

307
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,236
But I might get lonely.

308
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:13,115
Ah. I'll see if I can't
find you a special souvenir.

309
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,701
To cheer you up a little bit.

310
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,870
Demon Lord.

311
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:20,957
Please promise me you'll
come home safe and sound.

312
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,293
[KUNAI chuckles] Who do you
think you're talking to, huh?

313
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,796
[giggles]

314
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,006
[LUNA] Aku? What are
you doing out here?

315
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,925
Luna won't stop whining.

316
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,345
Aku and I were just having
a little chat, that's all.

317
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,597
You... You‐‐!

318
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,890
You damn pervert!

319
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:41,394
My butt wasn't enough for you,
so you had to go for Aku's, too?

320
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,814
By the way, I made sure
your sister got home safely.

321
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:48,276
I escorted her back to the
Holy Castle myself, in fact.

322
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,444
[gasps] Just great!

323
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,989
So now you've got your claws
in my sister, as well?

324
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,157
[TRON yawns]

325
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,119
All of this screaming is
really wearing me out.

326
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,037
[KUNAI, AKU, LUNA chuckle]

327
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:16,178
[OONO groans]
How did I end up like this?

328
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,775
[OONO] I'm never gonna
be able to sleep.

329
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,820
I'm not a damn teddy bear!

330
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,037
[KUNAI] Yu, you're in
charge of the hospital.

331
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,914
Do what you can to build our
reputation while I'm gone.

332
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,082
Of course.

333
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,917
Just leave everything to me.

334
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,879
[YU gasps]
Hold on. Here.

335
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,297
Your tie.

336
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:59,847
Tahara, Rabby Village and
its people are in your hands.

337
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,015
If there's an emergency,

338
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,602
you can send a message
to me at any given time.

339
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,228
Yeah, I got it.

340
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,814
But I seriously doubt
anything will come up

341
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,651
that I can't handle
without your help, Chief.

342
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,860
Heh.

343
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,324
[OONO]
Look at this place.

344
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,034
The village is changing.

345
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:23,537
It's come a long way,
and there's no turning back.

346
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,915
I have much to protect now.

347
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,543
[OONO] And in order to
keep them all safe,

348
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,129
I need to become even stronger.

349
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,966
My vulnerability to magic
will be used against me someday

350
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,220
if I can't find a
way to overcome it.

351
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:43,224
[KUNAI] Tahara, I have
one more order for you.

352
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,058
Huh?

353
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,726
If anyone comes near the village

354
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:49,355
with the intent of
doing it harm, end them.

355
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:53,317
Show no mercy, understand?

356
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,069
I understand.

357
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,906
Time to go.

358
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,450
The old man sure is impatient.

359
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,911
And so am I. Let's go!

360
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,121
Yeah, I can't wait.

361
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,124
You're gonna be impossible
on this trip. Hya!

362
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,628
[TAHARA]
That was weird.

363
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,588
A memory just hit me.

364
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,591
Guess our conversation
must've brought it back.

365
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,719
What kind of memory?

366
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,930
It was about Chief.
The very first day I met him.

367
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,807
That sounds interesting.

368
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,396
Well, there isn't a
whole lot to it, honestly.

369
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,898
Just at the time,

370
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,694
I knew that if I hadn't
accepted the chief's invitation,

371
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,405
it probably would've
cost me my life.

372
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,409
[TAHARA]
Fact is,

373
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,619
I can't even hold a
candle to the guy.

374
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,329
[YU]
Of course you can't.

375
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:51,083
Compared to the chief, you're
little more than a paramecium.

376
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,502
[TAHARA] Paramecium?
That's what you're going with?

377
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,504
Science nerd.

378
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:56,714
[YU]
Goodbye, Chief.

379
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,800
I'm pining for you already.

380
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,427
[TAHARA]
He just left!

381
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:02,553
[YU sighs]

382
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,515
Prison Dungeon in
the city of Rookie.

383
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,309
Should be interesting.

384
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:45,281
[CITIZENS chattering]

385
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,117
[KUNAI]
This is the city of Rookie, huh?

386
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:51,120
Seems like a pretty
prosperous place.

387
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,872
[MIKAN] Let's make our way
to the Prison Dungeon,

388
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,748
find whatever item it
is you're looking for,

389
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,875
and get out of here.

390
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:56,959
Hey, old man!

391
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,712
Let's make prison love
in the Prison Dungeon.

392
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,797
Hey! They're here!

393
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,465
The heroes came back!

394
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,300
[CITIZENS gasping]

395
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,135
[KUNAI]
What heroes?

396
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:21,317
Uh... Huh?!

397
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,360
[ALL]
To be continued!
