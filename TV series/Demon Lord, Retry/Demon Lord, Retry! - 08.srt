I'm Tron.

Now that's not a name

Mr. Zero!

Sorry. I just never
wanna let you go!

[KIRISAME]
Hey, hands off!

18
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,373
A man and a woman should show
a little more class than this.

19
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,624
Can't be helped!

20
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,710
The dragon on your back
is so freaking manly

21
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,044
I can't even stand it!

22
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,213
And that chest, too.

[KIRISAME]

24
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,822
[KUNAI]
It's an honor to meet you,

25
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,032
Holy Maiden Angel White.

26
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,120
Nice to meet you, too.

27
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,454
Come.

28
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:32,796
So, what would be appropriate
for me to call you?

29
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,840
Oh, just "Demon Lord"
is fine by me.

30
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,259
It would seem it's become
my official nickname, anyway,

31
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,594
so I might as well embrace it.

32
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,647
So, are you truly
the Demon Lord

33
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,150
that all the old
legends talk about?

34
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,609
If that's how you
wanna look at it,

35
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,987
I suppose I am, yeah.

36
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,697
And just what is
your involvement

37
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,490
with Luna at this point?

38
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,993
Meeting her was a disaster
waiting to happen,

39
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,411
as you can imagine.

40
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:08,039
At first, I'm sure she only
saw me as some evil being.

41
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,168
However, we've
been able to build

42
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,837
a pretty wonderful
relationship since then.

43
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,965
[WHITE]
H‐Huh? No way!

44
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,634
[LUNA]
I'm ordering you to do as I say!

45
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,137
[WHITE] Luna, the very
definition of selfish?

46
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:25,515
He must have put some kind
of crazy spell on her!

47
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,684
Tell me, are you
someone who plans

48
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,811
to bring harm to this kingdom?

49
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,860
[KUNAI] That's a simple
enough question to answer.

50
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,696
See, back in my country, we have
this terrific old saying:

51
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,532
a picture is worth
a thousand words.

52
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:45,243
What it basically means is that
seeing something in person

53
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,871
is always better than just
having it explained to you.

54
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,457
That's a very good way
to look at things.

55
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:53,335
I would suggest that you not
decide what you will about me

56
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,296
until after you've seen my
skills and achievements.

57
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,131
My actions have a
pretty strong tendency

58
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,090
to speak for themselves,

59
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:03,011
and, true to form, they're
always louder than my words.

60
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:06,681
[WHITE] Is he planning some kind
of invasion of the Holy Capital?

61
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,019
[KUNAI] By the way, there's a
favor I'd like to ask of you,

62
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,771
if it's no bother.

63
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,356
What would that be?

64
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,483
Well, truth is, I've been
thinking about doing

65
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,652
a little research on the Seraph.

66
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,403
So, if there's a
library available,

67
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,073
I was hoping you'd
let me make use of it.

68
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:23,949
[gasps]

69
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,618
[WHITE] Wait, why does he want
to know about the Seraph?

70
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,412
Is it to figure out her weak
spots so he can kill her?

71
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,747
He's so bold and shameless,

72
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,959
he's actually asking
permission right to my face!

73
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,466
You can use it as you wish.

74
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,968
You're welcome to.

75
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,971
Although, I hope you'll
forgive me if I insist

76
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,140
on not speaking about
the Seraph, myself.

77
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,684
[KUNAI]
I see.

78
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,435
Yes, that's perfectly fine.

79
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,979
I've been finding it
a little challenging

80
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,313
to carry on conversation

81
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,233
with a sacred being
such as yourself, anyway.

82
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:03,238
Now, it seems like a very
good time to excuse myself.

83
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,199
Thank you, this meeting
seemed quite productive.

84
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,326
Yes. I would tend to agree.

85
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,954
It has been enlightening
for me, as well.

86
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,296
Was it you...
who defeated the Demon King?

87
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,349
I still don't understand
how you people can

88
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,351
call that thing a Demon King.

89
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,396
To me, he just seemed
like a cheap imitation.

90
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,652

was nothing to him!

00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:59,210
[OONO] Man, that woman's
a total knockout!

95
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,755
And I must say,
she seems uniquely sensible

96
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,506
for a Holy Maiden.

97
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:07,052
Actually, maybe the other
two are the odd ones.

98
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,471
[OONO] Thanks to the
fight the other day,

99
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:13,558
I've got 1,249 skill points.

100
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,685
Not only can I summon an aide,

101
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,896
I can build the hospital
and some hot springs

102
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:21,316
and still have extra
points left over.

103
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,276
Using the Omni Travel
system command,

104
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:27,280
I can travel back to an area
I've gone to before, instantly.

can only mean one thing.

talk with the Holy Maiden?

father and daughter every day!

113
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:02,440
[KUNAI]
Hmm. I just don't get it.

114
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,735
This angel stuff sounds like
some kinda western fairy tale.

115
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,278
Well, at least the
pictures in this book

116
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,489
are super pretty,
don't you think?

117
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,409
Yeah, If only it was
meant to be a picture book.

118
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,411
So, did the angels exist
from the beginning,

119
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:18,081
or were they created by someone?
That's really the question.

120
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,709
And why is it that they
disappeared, anyway?

121
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,878
The demons they fought
against seem alive and well.

122
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,008
Huh? I really never thought
about it that way before.

123
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,051
The weirdest part is,
there's not a single thing

124
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,803
written here about the Seraph.

125
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,471
They just bail or what?

126
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,516
Oh, no, I don't think
that's what happened at all.

127
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:40,020
I feel sure they're watching
over us from somewhere!

128

At any rate,
we've got plenty of time.

We'll be able to come back here

What is this?

136
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,421
[NARRATOR 08A]
A long time ago,

137
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,798
there was a mischievous
dog named Fido

138
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,677
who used his sharp teeth to
destroy everything in his path.

139
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,721
One day, the villagers
decided they were

140
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:18,892
tired of his destructive
ways and drove him off.

141
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,811
To make ends meet,
Fido became an adventurer

142
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,981
and set out to explore
a nearby dungeon.

143
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,650
He delved deeper and
deeper into the dungeon,

144
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:31,654
tearing up other adventurers'
weapons and armor as he went.

a slime attacking another dog.

After saving her from the slime,

00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,962
Fido spent the rest of the
night gently nibbling her.

151
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,965
Fido finally reached the
deepest room of the dungeon,

152
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,551
and there, he discovered
a trove of rare weapons,

153

armor, and magical items.

154
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,263
He carried all of
them home with him,

00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,233
Don't the stories in
picture books usually have

159
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,986
some sort of meaningful
lesson in them or whatever?

160
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,198
Who was the target
demographic for this thing?

161
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,826
At least it's got
a cute puppy in it!

162
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,415
[OONO]
And he went into a dungeon, huh?

163
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,750
[KUNAI]
You there, librarian.

164
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,710
Yes, can I help you?

165
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,670
Tell me something,

166
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,172
is it true that weapons and
armor drop in dungeons

167
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:34,467
the way they do in this book,
or is that not a thing?

168
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:37,720
Oh, yes! I have heard that
people find rare, ancient items

169
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,389
from time to time.

170
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,101
Huh.

171
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,979
[OONO]
This body of mine is pretty much

172
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,107
impervious to physical
attacks, so that's good.

173
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,859
But my weak point is magic

174
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,444
because that stuff didn't
exist in <i>Infinity Game</i>,

175
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,613
so it's a brand‐new
thing for me.

176
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,491
[OONO] I definitely
need to find some way

177
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,327
to raise my magic
resistance by a lot.

178
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,204
As soon as possible.

179
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,044
Aku.

180
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,921
Go back to the inn
without me for now.

181
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,215
I've got something
I need to take care of.

182
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,092
'Kay, see ya later!

183
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,779
[KUNAI sighs]

184
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,406
[KUNAI]
Listen, I'm a pretty busy man,

185
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,950
despite what you might think.

186
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:44,078
I don't have time to
play hide‐and‐seek.

187
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,706
Wait, you're‐‐

188
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,920
I found you.

189
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,059
[OONO]
I know this kid.

190
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,686
She's the one I saved
as Zero, isn't she?

191
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:10,897
Well?

192
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,483
What is it you
want from me, runt?

193
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:17,654
Yep, you talk like Zero
and have the same color.

194
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:21,324
Color? Wait, back up,
what're you talking about?

195
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,952
I just see everything
as a color.

196
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,871
Even emotions and souls.

197
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,749
What, is that some new
form of fortune‐telling?

198
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,584
Go bug someone else.

199
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,044
[thud]

200
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,172
Bring out Zero right now.

201
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:39,259
Sorry, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

202
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,635
Wrong person.

203
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:44,138
Do it! You have to
bring him out! Right now!

204
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,557
Wait a minute, am I
missing something here?

205
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,268
I mean, what're you getting at?

206
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,478
Zero's‐‐

207
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,981
Well, it's just that you're
the one who saved my life,

208
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,608
so I want to see you!

209
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,403
[OONO] I've got no idea
how old this kid is,

210
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,321
but I can't just let
someone Zero saved

211
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,948
end up dying out in the streets.

212
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,242
That's definitely not okay.

213
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,494
Fine, you win.

214
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,746
But there are conditions
if you meet Zero.

215
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,290
You gonna be okay with that?

216
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,167
Of course. I'll do anything.

217
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,961
[KUNAI]
Listen, I'll tell you what.

218
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,171
If you obey my commands
and work hard for me,

219
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,756
I'll let you meet him.

220
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,384
What kind of thing do you
think I'd have to do as work?

221
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,636
Do I have to kill
lots of people?

222
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,054
What the hell?!

223
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:28,516
Why does everyone here have
the wrong idea about me?!

224
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,852
Oh, then what do I do?

225
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,855
Hmm. Soon enough, we're going
to feel short‐staffed

226
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,190
no matter how many
people we have.

227
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,067
If you could use your
strength and color thing

228
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,320
to lend me a hand, I think
I could arrange a meeting.

229
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,448
How does that sound? Good, runt?

230
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,158
My name's really Tron.

231
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,577
It's definitely not "runt."

232
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,207
[KUNAI]
A runt is a runt. Let's go.

233
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,584
Okay!

234
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,838
[KUNAI]
All right.

235
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,549
I take it everyone's ready
to roll? Let's get going.

236
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,594
Hey, Chief. Who's that
little girl with you?

237
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,182
[AKU gasps]
You have such beautiful hair!

238
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,225
[gasps] Whoa! What are you?

239
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,561
For real! There's
Devil in that girl!

240
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,355
[TRON gasps]

241
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,357
[OONO]
There's Devil in her?

242
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,901
That's too bad, 'cause we're
gonna need her in Rabby.

243
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,736
So just deal with it.

244
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,030
A Holy Maiden and Devilkin?

245
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,657
You're asking too much.

246
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,035
I think if we can manage
to turn that village around,

247
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,788
your sisters will see you
in a totally different light.

248
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,790
[gasps] I don't know.

249
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,333
[KUNAI] First of all,
those who are standing

250
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,751
at the pinnacle of a kingdom‐‐

251
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:37,585
[gasps]

252
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,253
[KUNAI] They should
really have the capacity

253
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,756
to deal with all
types of people.

254
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,050
If you only ever see
things in black and white,

255
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,594
you'll never move
forward in this life.

256
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,180
What is this? Why're
you preaching at me?

257
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,767
[KUNAI] I'm just saying, I have
high expectations, that's all.

258
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,269
Fine, all right then, go ahead!

259
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,270
Be warned!

260
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,232
I won't be this sweet
if she does something bad!

261
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,611
[KUNAI] Yu, are you
able to Omni Travel now?

262
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,488
[YU]
I am, Chief.

263
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,823
Incredible.

264
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,784
It feels like something
holding me down was removed.

265
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,953
Everyone, come here
and grab onto me.

266
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,205
We're jumping to Rabby Village.

267
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,753
[KUNAI] Yu, couldn't you
make the jump yourself?

268
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,423
[YU] It's nonsense
to consume 60 Power

269
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,175
when we have the option of only
using 30, though, Chief.

270
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:29,387
[KUNAI]
Well, you do have a point.

271
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,806
[KUNAI clears throat]
Here we go.

272
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:32,974
Omni Travel.

273
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,684
Rabby Village!

274
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,690
[AKU]
Wow, that was amazing!

275
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,024
[LUNA]
Are you kidding me?

276
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,152
How'd we manage to
get back to my territory

277
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,945
in the bare blink of an eye?

278
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,698
Yu, I want to start
construction right away.

279
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,700
Right, understood.

280
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,911
Hey, look! It's black
suit man, bunny!

281
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,540
The pulley wheel and the
fertilizer helped so much, hop!

282
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,126
[OONO]
Just wait.

283
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,003
I'll turn this village around.

284
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,756
By the time I'm done, it's gonna
be raining gold around here.

285
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:15,433
[KUNAI sighs] I guess this
spot will have to do.

286
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,902
It's time for
Rare Item Creation.

287
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,528
First Aid Kit.

288
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,411
[KUNAI]
Base Upgrade.

289
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,996
Field Hospital.

290
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,998
Hey, Chief, would you
like to go inside

291
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,666
and check things out together?

292
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,168
Good call.

293
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,548
[OONO]
There's no electricity,

294
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,176
yet everything seems
to be running just fine.

295
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,555
[KUNAI]
Well, is it good to go?

296
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:57,141
[YU]
Yep. We could even start today.

297
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,226
But what are your thoughts on

298
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,728
how we should deal
with charging people?

299
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:04,106
[KUNAI] This is just to have
something in place, but...

300
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,234
Let's start by
assigning coins to values

301
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,818
that we're familiar with.

302
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,487
And if it ends up being wrong,

303
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,365
then we can always
adjust it in the future.

304
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,824
I like your style.

305
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,078
With this world having so many
different values and cultures,

306
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,373
we don't have much choice but to
boldly take a shot in the dark.

307
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,626
Well, let's see, based on
my experience thus far...

308
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:27,129
Copper's a hundred yen,
giant copper is a thousand,

309
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,591
silver's ten thousand,
and gold's a hundred K.

310
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:34,595
And the elusive giant gold coin
is worth around two million.

311
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,766
[KUNAI] There's also something
called a holy lambda coin,

312
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,519
but depending on the season
and what the market does,

313
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,479
it changes value.

314
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,149
Regarding the
prices for treatment.

315
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,568
I want you to care for the poor,

316
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,320
but don't charge them
more than they can afford.

317
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:54,156
Trying to collect money from
people who simply don't have it

318
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,534
is an enormous waste of time.

319
00:17:56,576 --> 00:18:00,454
As for the nobles,
charge as much as you want.

320
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,540
Right! Sounds like a plan.

321
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,584
We'll help the poor
and fleece the rich,

322
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,211
which means we'll gain the
support of the common people.

323
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,754
You do realize
that you're taking

324
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:12,174
the exact opposite approach
of the Great Empire?

325
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,634
Nothing's more boring to me

326
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,511
than treading down
a well‐beaten path.

327
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:18,431
Always feels a little more
like going backwards.

328
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,350
Yes. We have that in common.

329
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,311
Somehow, I just knew
our minds and hearts

330
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,146
were on the same page!

331
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,397
[gulps]

332
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,358
[OONO] Okay, I'll admit,
that was oddly cute,

333
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,029
but seriously, has she
always been this way?

334
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,489
[KUNAI]
Base. Rare Item Creation.

335
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,408
Walled Springs!

336
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,412
[OONO]
Right next to the hospital...

337
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,624
[OONO]
Hot springs, baby!

338
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,626
Not bad, if I say so, myself.

339
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,795
Three massive and
magnificent floors of fun!

340
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,298
Carbon dioxide bath. Vase bath.

341
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,051
Stone sauna. Electric bath.

342
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,095
Herbal bath. Even one outdoors!

343
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,057
And a salt sauna to top it off.

344
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,185
A great hall and fully‐
equipped dining room.

345
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,355
With beautiful lodging on
the second and third floors!

346
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,565
And when it comes to
Japanese hot springs,

347
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:13,277
you know you gotta have bamboo.

348
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,321
It's making me miss home.

349
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:18,616
[KYON] Wow, that sure
came out of nowhere, hop.

350
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,576
[MOMO]
It's unbelievable, bunny.

351
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,788
[OONO] Those two are stylish
enough and easy on the eyes.

352
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,039
They can work reception.

353
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,499
When you finish your work today,

354
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,167
I want you to assemble
all the villagers

355
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,002
and bring them here,
do you understand?

356
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,880
Okay, but why are we
bringing them, hop?

357
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,882
Well, my thought is that
in order for you to be

358
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,217
the best hosts for our guests,

359
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,594
it's important for everyone
to experience it first,

360
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,638
as guests, yourselves.

361
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,729
In other words,
you get some bathing time.

362
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,315
Bathing? But only wealthy nobles

363
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,859
can afford luxuries
like that, bunny.

364
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,945
[OONO] Right, in this world,
people are lucky

365
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,698
to wipe themselves off
with a damp cloth.

366
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,492
Should I open up a bath house
for commoners, then?

367
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:05,871
It's doable with the High
Level Item, Kanda River.

368
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,540
If we charge three copper coins,

369
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:11,127
I have no doubt it would bring
in customers by the droves!

370
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,713
By the way, we'll also need
to destroy and rebuild

371
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,881
your houses in the
very near future.

372
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:19,510
[gasps] I might have a
problem with that, hop!

373
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,761
Black suit man!

374
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,806
I thought you were nice,
but this is tyranny, bunny!

375
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,933
[KUNAI] Who you calling
"black suit man"?

376
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,978
You got something to
say about my wardrobe?

377
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:29,979
Before we know it,

378
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,481
we'll be building both legit
and unlicensed casinos

379
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,358
and anything else we
can possibly think of

380
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,527
to entertain all those
rich nobles out there

381
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:40,197
with more money in their pockets
than they know what to do with!

382
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,075
[laughing]

383
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,077
Black suit man's scary, hop.

384
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,080
Black suit man is broken, bunny.

385
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:55,129
[OONO] No matter how luxurious
the hot spring resort is,

386
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:56,922
if the employees don't
do their jobs well,

387
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,049
it won't amount to much.

388
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,259
Among the eight aides,

389
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,303
there was one standout
genius who could not only

390
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,722
immediately master
whatever you threw at him,

391
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,099
but also consistently
produced better results

392
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,226
than any of the others.

393
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,770
He's got a real nurturing side,

394
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,773
so he can watch
kids, no problem.

395
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,400
Also, being a gun specialist
with combat prowess

396
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,194
and crazy skills like his,

397
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,154
he'll easily be able to
protect Rabby Village

398
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,782
even when I'm not around.

399
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,701
He and Yu actually get
along pretty well, too.

400
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,453
Admin Privileges!

401
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,246
Aide Summon!

402
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,831
Isami Tahara.

403
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,209
I command you to
appear before me.

404
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:54,104
Huh? Well, if it
isn't the chief.

405
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,739
[OONO]
That sure takes me back.

406
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,282
Masaru Katou.

407
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,617
Yuuya Kondo.

408
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,368
Takefumi Nomura.

409
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,163
[AKU] Are those more aides
of yours, Demon Lord?

410
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,332
[OONO] Here's what
they are: a fencing idiot,

411
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,750
a <i>hikikomori</i> archer,

412
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,668
and a mixed martial
arts champion.

413
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,836
[AKU]
Huh?

414
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:44,590
I have to admit, I'm not exactly
sure what some of that means,

415
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,050
but they sound
super interesting!

416
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,386
[KUNAI] Next time:
<i>Demon Lord, Retry</i> Episode 9.

417
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,765
"Dancing Swindler and
the Giant Gold Coin."
