00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,853
Luna, you stand out too
much in that outfit.

2
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:21,605
Here, why don't
you try these on?

3
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:23,690
You want me to change?

4
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,901
Wait a minute, I bet you're
just trying to get me into

5
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,611
something sexier, aren't you?

6
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,655
Don't be stupid.

7
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,156
Just put it on.

8
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:37,204
Oh, wow. It's so normal.

9
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,164
Yeah! And I think
Demon Lord must've

10
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:42,084
chosen that outfit
especially for you.

11
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,126
You'll look great!

No doubt in my mind,
Sister Luna.

13
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:50,133
Well, I guess you could
be right about that.

14
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,821
[MIKAN grunting]
Keep an eye out.

15
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,406
I'm pretty sure they
said the sandwolves

16
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:39,034
should be right
around this area.

17
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,286
Got it? You ready?

18
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,790
Always ready. Too ready, 'kay?

19
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,460
Would it be too much to ask for
you to not be a smartass today?

20
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,546
Sorry, I'm afraid it's just
part of the package now.

Wow, that's great.

How lucky for me, am I right?

[YUKIKAZE sighs]
This heat is the worst.

24
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,387
My boobs are all sweaty.

25
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,264
But you don't even have
boobs to begin with.

That tells me a lot about you.

The truth is, only those

he was a gorgeous girl.

But, he's a dude.

Why do you keep staring
at me like that?

[MIKAN clears throat]
Sorry, it's nothing.

34
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,663
We should be
focusing on the job.

35
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,581
Sandwolves, huh?

36
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:30,961
As far as monsters go, they can
be a fairly dangerous breed.

37
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,672
In a pack, they're
downright ferocious.

38
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,507
And I've even heard stories
that they've managed

39
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,635
to attack and
destroy entire cities!

40
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,637
Yeah, but on the other hand,

41
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,347
as long as there aren't
a whole lot of them,

42
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,432
they're easily handled.

43
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,684
So, there's no real
reason to be worried.

00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,583
From the dirty look on his face,

162
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,168
I bet you anything
he's thinking about

163
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,087
something perverted right now.

164
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,798
Like maybe our butts?

165
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,673
I'm gonna need peace

166
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,760
to do some deep thinking
for a bit, you two.

167
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,054
Why don't you get in
the base to be safe?

168
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,431
Wait, what do you
mean by "base"?

169
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:08,942
What in the world?

170
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,401
A magic house?

171
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,653
Yeah, and guess what?

172
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,781
There's even a barrel bath
waiting for us inside!

173
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,950
Barrel bath? What is that?

174
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,076
[AKU giggles]

175
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,425
You can go inside too
if you want, you know.

176
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,261
Oh, thank you, sir.

177
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,054
But I think I should
probably just stay here

178
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,514
and feed the horse.

179
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,268
[KUNAI] Well, at least
take one of these, okay?

180
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,978
It'll give you a
little somethin'.

181
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,901
Ooh, this is really
good stuff, huh?

182
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,070
I gotta admit, you really
did show some guts

183
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,822
during that whole fiasco.

184
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,198
You didn't panic
in the slightest

185
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,366
even when it was crazy,

186
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,577
and I found that to
be pretty impressive.

187
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,370
Uh, well, that's‐‐

188
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,581
I mean, that's because you're‐‐

189
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,207
It's because I'm what?

190
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:09,544
No! Never mind.
I'm just a dumb coachman!

191
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,255
Interesting. As you wish.

192
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,893
[OONO]
Finally! It's about time!

193
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,395
In <i>Infinity Game</i>, there are
those eight awesome aides

194
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,481
that always work directly
under Hakuto Kunai.

195
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,192
And the truth is,
every last one of them

196
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,486
is worth at least a
thousand of anyone else.

197
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,698
They do require a fair
share of skill points,

198
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,033
but their talents
should definitely

199
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,618
make it all worthwhile.

200
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,369
With my current amount
of skill points,

201
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,372
looks like I can
only summon one.

202
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,874
I need to put some
serious thought

203
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,001
into which one I should call.

204
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,921
[OONO] My underlings
and I have no real way

205
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,964
to guard ourselves
against magic.

206
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,591
That's a potentially
lethal weak point

207
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,928
that I can't afford
to keep putting off.

208
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,638
I should probably
make it a priority

209
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,849
to choose an aide who's
equipped to address that issue.

210
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,977
[OONO]
Yu Kirino, then?

211
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,021
I mean, having a genius
doctor and scientist

212
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,148
of her caliber working on it,

213
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,483
there's no way we
won't end up with

214
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,277
some amazing invention
to shield against magic.

215
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,447
[OONO] Flip side,
there is the problem of

216
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,784
her sadistic tendencies
and her absurdly short temper.

217
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,161
She'd kill and dissect someone
without batting an eye

218
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,371
for no other reason than to

219
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,499
satisfy her own
strange curiosity.

220
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,252
And she's weird
about little boys.

221
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,170
Argh, just do it already!

222
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,714
In the rare case she turns on
you, you know you can take her!

223
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,758
She's a solid choice!

224
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,219
Okay, here we go!

225
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,971
Admin Privileges!

226
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,013
Aide Summon!

227
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,891
Yu Kirino, I command you
to appear before me!

228
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,143
Did you call for me? My chief.

229
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,854
[KUNAI]
I did. Thank you for coming.

230
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,856
[YU] I'll always come
to wherever you are

231
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,275
if that's what you command.

232
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,110
Now, then, where are we?

233
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,487
Is this a new game
arena or something?

234
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,490
[OONO]
She's talking!

235
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,534
And she's acting of
her own free will!

236
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,953
I can't believe I'm getting
to see one of my characters

237
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,497
come to life right
in front of me!

238
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,374
Chief? You good?

239
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,126
[KUNAI clears throat]

240
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,712
I wonder where I should start
with this explanation.

241
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,423
'Kay, first of all,
this isn't the Great Empire.

242
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,343
Wow, this bath isn't half bad!

243
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,011
[AKU giggles]
Oh, good!

244
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,221
I'm so glad that you
like it, Sister Luna!

245
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,266
Sure do! Honestly,
I kinda want the whole house!

246
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,477
Hey! I have a great idea!

247
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,355
I'm going to convince him to
give it to me as a present!

248
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,522
Will you help?

249
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,441
Um, I guess so.

250
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,736
I'm not sure exactly what Demon
Lord might have to say about it,

251
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,154
but I can definitely ask.

252
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,531
Oh, yay! Yes, please do, Aku!

253
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,826
[AKU gasps]
That's a little bit close!

254
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,540
From everything you've said
so far, in my opinion,

255
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,710
it sounds just like a
forced positioning attack.

256
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:38,836
Oh, yeah.

257
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,755
That explains this scenery.

258
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,590
Which, needless to say,
is a lot different

259
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,467
than the world we're from.

260
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,136
It's nice to talk to
someone who gets it.

261
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,597
So, about how we should proceed.

262
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,890
Listen, Chief.

263
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,308
Regardless of the situation,

264
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,603
I believe the Nightless
City is what's needed.

265
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,438
[OONO]
Nightless City.

266
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,608
It's home to the most advanced
technology in the Great Empire.

267
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:04,112
And it's the final area
of <i>Infinity Game</i>.

268
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,656
But if we were to erect
such a huge modern fortress

269
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,741
in a fantasy world like this,

270
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:12,078
it would immediately be seen as
the "Demon Lord's Castle."

271
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,204
Come on.

272
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,040
Don't you think we were
brought here for a reason?

273
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,041
[KUNAI]
Mm.

274
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,794
Okay, yes, I concede
that it might be possible.

275
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,547
[chuckles] Well,
I'm glad to hear that.

276
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,340
Huh?

277
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,968
I think it's clear to both
of us what we're meant to do.

278
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,636
Surely, you agree?

279
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,264
Yes, but getting there
is a long way off.

280
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,642
A journey of a thousand miles
begins with a single step.

281
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,145
There you go again.
You can find the bright side

282
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,689
to just about any
situation, it seems.

283
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,150
Oh, enjoyment can be
found in everything.

284
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,277
That's been my belief, anyway.

285
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,653
That's very true.

286
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,448
So, then, what would you
like our first move to be?

287
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,366
I think our first order
of business should be

288
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,161
to upgrade the base
to a field hospital.

289
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,121
[YU chuckles]

290
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,539
Do you know what?

291
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,750
All the wishes I've ever had
have been granted by you, Chief.

292
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,544
Well, it's only natural.

293
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,504
The wishes of my
very talented underling

294
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,339
are the same as my own.

295
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,341
I appreciate that.

296
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,759
Speaking of the hospital.

297
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,928
I forbid you to kill anyone.

298
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,848
We need to learn a lot more
before we do anything else.

299
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,765
Agreed.

300
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,477
We can't possibly proceed
while knowing so little.

301
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,896
Learning more is of
vital importance.

302
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,315
For now, I'll make sure to
give you all the information

303
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,275
I've gathered so far.

304
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,737
[OONO] Yu is much smarter
than I am, without a doubt.

305
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,489
She was designed as
a genius doctor,

306
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,616
not to mention a mad sadist.

307
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,118
I can barely
comprehend her, myself.

308
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,039
[OONO]
I'll need to be very careful

309
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,082
not to slip up with this one.

310
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,092
Oh, my, what a beautiful person!

311
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,011
So, is she your lover?

312
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,930
I mean, how'd she get here?

313
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,767
This is an aide of mine,
whom I've summoned.

314
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,435
So, get along with her.

315
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,437
Hello! My name is Aku!

316
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:05,441
I'm the Kingdom of Holy Light's
third Holy Maiden, Luna. Okay?

317
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,609
And don't you forget it.

318
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:07,735
I'm charmed.

319
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,530
Aku. Holy Maiden Luna.

320
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,824
Hey, by the way, could
you look at Aku's leg?

321
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,411
[gasps]

322
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,414
All right, Aku.
Can you relax for me?

323
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,166
Uh, 'kay.

324
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:26,629
[YU]
Atta girl.

325
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,882
Uh, your hand, I‐‐
I've never seen‐‐

326
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,593
Oh, there's nothing
to worry about.

327
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:33,928
Just the tip.

328
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,055
Just the tip, I swear, okay?

329
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,516
Why is your breathing
all heavy and scary?

330
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,269
Aku, think you could
dress as a boy?

331
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,812
I mean, once we're done?

332
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,565
Yu. We don't have
time to play around.

333
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,150
Of course, my apologies.

334
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,445
This will only sting
for a second, okay, love?

335
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,075
[gasps]

336
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,743
Hey, wait, Demon Lord.

337
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,829
Are you sure
she'll be all right?

338
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,247
Nothing to worry about.

339
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,457
You need to learn to
trust me and my underlings.

340
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,711
Yeah, well, I haven't trusted
you a single time so far.

341
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,755
[KUNAI grunts]

342
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,219
There. Wasn't too bad, right?

343
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,346
And I cleaned up
your scar, as well.

344
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,974
Your leg is as good as new.

345
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,434
All finished?

346
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,810
Aku, can you stand?

347
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,854
[AKU]
Huh? Sure.

348
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:35,197
[AKU gasping]

349
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,824
It doesn't hurt!

350
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:42,079
[AKU gasps]
I can walk! On both my legs!

351
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:44,498
[AKU]
Demon Lord!

352
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,583
[KUNAI]
Hm?

353
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,878
Um... I'm...

354
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,464
I'm not walking weird
any more, am I?

355
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,508
No, you're walking
perfectly normal.

356
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,348
Miss Yu, thank you so much!

357
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,474
My pleasure.

358
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,392
But you should really
thank the Chief.

359
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,352
[OONO]
Is it a good idea

360
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,146
to have her practice
walking around some?

361
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,356
We'll be back.

362
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,899
You go on inside.

363
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,401
Understood, Chief. Thank you.

364
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,655
[AKU panting]

365
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,616
Hey now, don't horse
around too much.

366
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:24,080
[AKU panting, giggling]

367
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,206
Did you see that?

368
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,624
I can run now!

369
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,750
Didn't I tell you?

370
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,294
Nothing is impossible
for the Great Empire.

371
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,380
I mean, this is like a dream!

372
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,216
I can't believe my leg
doesn't hurt anymore!

373
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,886
[KUNAI]
It's no dream.

374
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,388
If I have anything
to say about it,

375
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:44,308
you'll be able to walk without
pain for the rest of your life.

376
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,978
Um, would you mind
pinching my cheek, please?

377
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,146
Uh‐‐

378
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,774
Again with those classic lines.

379
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,863
Well, anyway.

380
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,825
I'm really happy for you.

381
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,162
[AKU]
Demon Lord.

382
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,290
Do you think we could walk
around a little longer?

383
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,919
[AKU]
Now you don't have to let me

384
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,921
ride on your back
anymore, I guess.

385
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:17,133
Nah, I can always give you
a lift when you're tired.

386
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,303
Promise me that you'll
never leave me.

387
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,098
You should save that line.

388
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,850
You'll want to use it
sometime in the future

389
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,394
when you meet the
person you like.

390
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,771
Oh, I dunno.

391
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,023
I think I already did!

392
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,194
[AKU]
Hey there! We're back!

393
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,363
Did your leg hold up
all right, Aku?

394
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,949
Did this perv Demon
Lord try anything?

395
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,993
You have a real
talent for rudeness.

396
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,454
To be honest,
I'm almost impressed.

397
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,585
[KUNAI] Yu, that was
some excellent work.

398
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,961
I was right to have chosen you.

399
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,212
[YU gasps]

400
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,549
[YU]
What is this feeling?

401
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,845
My body, my heart,
my very cells.

402
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,890
I'm trembling with bliss all
the way to the tips of my hair.

403
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,641
What is that?

404
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,352
It's almost as if some
kind of all‐powerful creator

405
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,105
has finally acknowledged
my presence.

406
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:18,819
[YU] An overwhelming sense of
euphoria is enveloping my body.

407
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,614
I'll be needing all of your
support from here on out.

408
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,449
I'm really counting on you.

409
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,284
Right, yes!

410
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,329
[YU]
Why?

411
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,164
Being praised like this.

412
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,166
Being needed like this.

413
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,376
Why does it make me so happy?

414
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,339
[YU] I feel different
than I've ever felt before.

415
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,424
And really,
the chief is different

416
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,468
than he used to be, too!

417
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,094
I want to know more!

418
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,973
About these feelings,
but also about Chief!

419
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:28,866
[OONO] Today, I walked
hand in hand with Aku.

420
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,075
At the start of all this,

421
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,746
I was upset at being pulled
into this world out of nowhere.

422
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:37,708
But honestly, just being able
to mend little Aku's leg,

423
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,794
that seriously might've made
the entire crazy thing worth it.

424
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:44,715
[AKU snoring]

425
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,009
[AKU]
Demon Lord...

426
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,847
[KUNAI] Next time:
<i>Demon Lord, Retry</i> Episode 5.

427
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,933
"Merciless Invasion."
