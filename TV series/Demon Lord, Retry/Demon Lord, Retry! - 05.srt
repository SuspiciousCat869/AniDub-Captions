00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,684
Can we? They're so pricey now.

162
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,394
Earth Crystals, too.

163
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,897
The soil is so bad
that without Crystals,

164
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:27,275
there's no way we'll be
able to grow carrots.

165
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,110
[MOMO]
No one can grow them but us,

166
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:32,489
so at least we can get a
good price from the harvest.

167
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,575
But when I think of how
many Crystals we'll need...

168
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,079
[KUNAI] What's the deal with
the rabbit‐eared people?

169
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,247
They're a race called "Bunnies."

170
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,291
What they say is that long ago,

171
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,960
the Cherub loved
and adored them.

172
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,378
There aren't many of them,

173
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,131
but they've all gathered
here to live together.

174
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,550
Adored, huh?

175
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:56,012
Almost seems more like they're
being quarantined here.

176
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,431
Because the Kingdom
of Holy Light...

177
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:02,227
...kind of hates all the
other races except humans.

Hold on, what did
you do that for?

00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,942
Heh. No reason, really.

Just a little friendly

Stop lying to me!

You're a pervert and all you
wanted was to touch my butt,

am I right? I'm right, aren't I?

You know I'm right!

Could you save your
dreams for bedtime?

188
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,247
I, for one,
would like to go hear

189
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,165
what the Bunnies have to say.

Oh, so you're already
bored with my butt

and now you're gonna go
after the Bunnies' butts!

You're the perviest demon

Yes, I can see the water
shortage is causing you trouble.

195
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:56,239
Is there anything you
can do, Demon Lord?

196
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,741
You knew good and well that
your vassals were in need

back and didn't help them.

Not exactly model
Holy Maiden behavior.

It isn't my fault, okay?

200
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,792
I was always taught to
keep my pretty little hands

out of the dirty workings
of the day‐to‐day.

So, you said your
name was Kyon, right?

203
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,008
Is there a well for
water in this village?

00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,386

Um, yes, there is! Hop!

This is prob'ly obvious,

208
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,603
but why do you use
the word "hop" so much?

209
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,146
Oh, we've just learned

Did you say your name was Momo?

You can skip all
the "hopping," too.

Please, just guide

Okay, what kind of

221
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,724
Not good.

222
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,644
The underground water vein
is completely exhausted,

223
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,562
and it's likely that
digging any deeper would be

224
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,857
a complete waste of
time and resources.

225
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,151
Ah, that figures.

226
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,736
But we don't have
the budget to go out

227
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,030
and buy more Water

What'll we do?

231
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,335
[OONO] Let's see, a Pulley
Wheel is a low‐level item,

232
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,921
so it's only five skill points.

233
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,256
When you play <i>Infinity Game</i>,

234
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,091
plastic bottles
filled up with water

[OONO]
In areas with water wells,

237
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:46,224
you could use a Pulley Wheel
in order to draw the water up.

Cool, I've got 265 skill points.

hospital and hot springs,

Where the heck do you
get all that stuff from?

I suppose the simplest answer is
a fragment of my intelligence.

Right. That makes total sense.

probably go ahead

[OONO] As I thought,
it's regular water.

00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,644
I would definitely
have to rethink my plan

if it was water that
recovered HP, but...

288
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,775
Then again, if Water Crystals
are valuable enough to be sold,

289
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,152
it probably wouldn't be the
smartest move in the world

290
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,405
to let this go public.

00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,365
Well? You gonna explain?

00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,866
Why's water suddenly coming out

just because you
added that thing?

[KUNAI] This is a magic
Pulley Wheel from my homeland.

295
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:14,956
As you can see,

296
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,835
it draws water from even
the most dried up wells.

297
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,462
I'm sure it's not hard
to understand how valuable

298
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,465

00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,924
Momo, look!
This fertilizer is amazing!

318
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,887
Oh, wow! It's overflowing
with blessed power!

319
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,430
[OONO] Well, this should
lighten up the mood

320
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,390
in the village for
a bit, at least.

321
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,767
We can fix it up all we want,
but no one's gonna come here

322
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,480
if the whole place is just
a bunch of downer bunnies.

323
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,940
Just like the thing
with the tea bowl.

324
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,401
it's hard to process that
such utter pieces of crap

325
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,111
can be so valuable here.

326
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,238
Kinda unbelievable.

327
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,158
[KUNAI]
Hm?

328
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,910
So. I've been thinking...

329
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,537
...that I guess you must
have some good in you.

330
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,039
Huh?

331
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,499
You're smarter than that.

332
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,543
It isn't out of the goodness
of my heart or whatever.

333
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,837
Everything I do is for a reason.

334
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,756
Then hat's your reason now?

335
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,090
Oh, I bet I know!

336
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,134
You wanna do nasty
things to the Bunnies!

337
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,303
[KUNAI sighs]
You're being dumb.

338
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,138
Surely you understand
that somebody has to

339
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,225
operate the hospital
and hot springs, right?

340
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,728
The only think I want to do
to the Bunnies is employ them.

341
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,897
Like this.

342
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:06,108
Ohh? Well, if it helps
my village develop

343
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,276
and if it raises my allowance,

344
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,153
then I guess I've
got no complaints.

345
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,071
That's good,

346
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,782
because I'm just laying down
the groundwork for now.

347
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,618
We'll do more once we
return from the capital.

348
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,413
You better be planning to spoil
my brains out while we're there!

349
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,541
Lots of clothes
shopping, am I right?

350
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,334
[KUNAI] Why should I
have to be dragged into

351
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,795
clothes shopping with you?

352
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,470
My goodness,
isn't that something.

353
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,473
So Miss Luna is taking over
the church‐run territory...

354
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:38,516
...because she would prefer to

355
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,768
handle it all on
her own, correct?

356
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,853
We should be pleased.

357
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,399
I admit, I'm worried about her.

358
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,734
The one calling
himself Demon Lord‐‐

359
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,904
I'm afraid that he may be
deceiving her, greatly.

360
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,197
Oh, don't worry.

361
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,241
If that bad man
bothers you so much,

362
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,492
you know I'd be more than happy

363
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,161
to discipline him
myself for you.

364
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,749
Miss Luna has obviously
chosen to trust this person.

365
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,877
I don't believe we have the
right to interfere with that.

366
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,254
[sighs] That's a crock.

367
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,715
Isn't his face already
plastered on wanted posters

368
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,841
all over the city?

369
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:15,636
Dona, that's because of the
damage that was caused in town.

370
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,346
You know what that's about.

371
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,432
You wish to punish
someone Miss Luna trusts

372
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,267
because of a rumor.

373
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,644
Please, you know full
well that Blitzo reported

374
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,188
one of his remote villages
was burnt to a crisp!

375
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,941
Besides, didn't this Demon Lord
person completely destroy

376
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,735
Miss Luna's escort?

377
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,281
[MARSHALL] According to all
the reports I've received,

378
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,409
only a single house in the
village was actually burned.

379
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:42,705
I think perhaps it could be that
Blitzo exaggerated the incident.

380
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:44,999
Come now!

381
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,960
Are you telling me that you
don't trust the word of a noble?

382
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,378
Trust is earned.

383
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,589
I bestow it based upon
a person's merit,

384
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,382
not their status.

385
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,301
As far as I'm concerned,

386
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,428
the reports from my
subordinates are more likely

387
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,848
to be accurate than
anything Blitzo says.

388
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:05,227
It's a rare thing for her to
act upon something on her own.

389
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,773
For the time being, I believe
we should wait and see.

390
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,149
Yes, of course!

391
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:13,110
If that's what the
Holy Maiden prefers.

392
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,570
As you wish.

393
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:22,787
[DONA groans]
What an insufferable person.

394
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:27,625
[DONA]
He is the worst!

395
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,793
[KILLER QUEEN grunts]

396
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:37,259
I heard you had a rough
time the other day.

397
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,136
I'm glad you're okay.

398
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,141
You ran into Luna in
the city of Yahoo, right?

399
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,602
How did she seem to be doing?

400
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,938
The report I received said
that she was traveling

401
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,440
with this man who's
calling himself Demon Lord,

402
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,526
so now I'm worried sick.

403
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,611
A Dragonkin got involved
in the whole mess

404
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:59,031
somehow as well,
apparently, so...

405
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:00,783
I'm in love.

[WHITE gasps]

407
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:05,621
For real, I think I'm
in love with that man.

408
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,804
I can't stop thinking about
how perfectly cool he was.

409
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,180
Wait, hold up.

410
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,599
Just what exactly are
you saying right now?

411
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,103
Are you... Are you actually
referring to that Dragonkin?

412
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,231
His crazy speed and that
beautiful fighting spirit.

413
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:33,733
His shock wave that
literally embodied

414
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,735
the form of a freakin' dragon!

415
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,404
Um, but, Queen,
isnt it hard to believe

416
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,614
that there was a
real Dragonkin there?

417

the form of a dra‐‐

You wouldn't be
spoutin' that nonsense

420
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,122
if you'd been there
to see him, like I was!

421
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,207
His strong, powerful fists!

422
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,042
His striking figure!

423
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,295
His impossibly
magnificent good looks!

424
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,756
And his cool lines!

425
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,383
Could we calm down a bit?

426
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,303
You gutless worms are too
early to face the dragon

427
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,430
by around a thousand years.

I'm rude and I pick fights

smell incredible!

Will someone please explain to

Do those Bunnies have human
ears as well as rabbit ones?
