[NOBIMARU] Problem is, we can't

00:09:09.542 --> 00:09:11.709
[KABANE gasps]

00:09:16.208 --> 00:09:17.834
[KABANE]
What the...?

00:09:20.667 --> 00:09:21.917
[KABANE]
Inari.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.792
[NOBIMARU] I thought it
was dangerous to touch.

00:09:26.875 --> 00:09:28.750
You're absolutely right!

00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:30.583
I have to wonder
if the lifestone

00:09:30.667 --> 00:09:33.834
might be counteracting
the nullstone's power.

00:09:33.917 --> 00:09:36.041
Did you know something
like this could happen?

00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:37.834
That the two stones would fuse?

00:09:37.917 --> 00:09:39.792
Whatever do you mean?

00:09:41.625 --> 00:09:43.709
[INUGAMI]
That belongs to Kabane.

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:46.208
Why don't you give
it back, Inari.

00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:49.166
Oh? But are you sure
this is the lifestone?

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.917
Couldn't it be the nullstone?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
[INUGAMI]
If it's the nullstone,

00:09:52.083 --> 00:09:53.917
then it belongs to
the snowy village.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.417
But the village has fallen.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.250
[INUGAMI] Two of these
kids are from there.

00:09:58.333 --> 00:09:59.792
Show some tact.

00:10:04.583 --> 00:10:07.875
[INARI] Overly-conscientious
men are such a pain.

00:10:07.959 --> 00:10:09.500
Well, if I can't have
the nullstone,

00:10:09.583 --> 00:10:11.875
then there's no point
in sticking around.

00:10:11.959 --> 00:10:13.583
Let's go, Nobimaru.

00:10:13.667 --> 00:10:15.500
[NOBIMARU]
Yes, Lady Inari.

00:10:15.583 --> 00:10:16.834
Nobimaru!

00:10:18.083 --> 00:10:19.500
Come to the clinic with us.

00:10:19.583 --> 00:10:22.834
I bet Aya would heal your
right hand if we asked her to.

00:10:22.917 --> 00:10:24.542
You were the one who
came up with the plan

00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:27.250
to stop Akira's brother.

00:10:27.333 --> 00:10:29.750
While I appreciate it,
I'll have to pass.

00:10:29.834 --> 00:10:32.625
This injury was brought
on by my own gullibility,

00:10:32.709 --> 00:10:34.625
so I'll keep it as a reminder.

00:10:34.709 --> 00:10:36.083
See you later, everyone!

00:10:36.166 --> 00:10:37.542
Take care.

00:10:40.709 --> 00:10:43.625
[AYA] Let's see. If we add it
all up, it comes to this.

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:45.125
[SHIKI]
Are you nuts?!

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:51.583
[KABANE gasps]

00:10:51.667 --> 00:10:52.875
[AKIRA]
Is someone out there?

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.667
Hey, Kabane.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.041
Uh... I, uh...

00:10:58.125 --> 00:11:01.792
I was hoping I could ask your
brother something once he's up.

00:11:01.875 --> 00:11:04.291
No big deal,
sorry to bother you.

00:11:04.375 --> 00:11:05.625
I'll just wait over there.

00:11:05.709 --> 00:11:08.792
[AKIRA] Hold on! When I
said I hated you, I lied!

00:11:08.875 --> 00:11:10.208
[gasps]

00:11:10.291 --> 00:11:11.625
I'm sorry!

00:11:11.709 --> 00:11:14.834
I thought it was my only option
to keep you guys alive.

00:11:14.917 --> 00:11:17.375
But it was an awful
thing to say.

00:11:17.458 --> 00:11:20.291
Truth is, I love everyone
so much it hurts!

00:11:20.375 --> 00:11:22.917
You included! I love you a ton!

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.458
[gasps]

00:11:25.542 --> 00:11:27.083
--[KABANE] That's great!
--[AKIRA] I'm sorry!

00:11:27.166 --> 00:11:28.250
[KABANE]
That's great!

00:11:28.333 --> 00:11:30.166
[INUGAMI]
Turn down the dance party, yeah?

00:11:31.959 --> 00:11:34.792
[YUI]
Sir Kabane, thank you.

00:11:34.875 --> 00:11:36.500
For stopping me.

00:11:36.583 --> 00:11:37.750
You're welcome.

00:11:37.834 --> 00:11:39.834
[INUGAMI] I got a rundown
of what happened,

00:11:39.917 --> 00:11:41.041
but you'd know best.

00:11:41.125 --> 00:11:43.166
Is the snowy village
really gone?

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:44.333
[YUI]
Mm-hm.

00:11:44.417 --> 00:11:46.291
Those women deceived me.

00:11:46.375 --> 00:11:50.250
And in despair, I gave myself
over to the nullstone's power.

00:11:50.333 --> 00:11:53.333
Before I knew it,
everything around me was white,

00:11:53.417 --> 00:11:54.834
and the only things
on my mind were

00:11:54.917 --> 00:11:57.834
"Tokyo", "Kemonoist", "Inugami",

00:11:57.917 --> 00:12:00.375
and of course, Akira.

00:12:00.458 --> 00:12:02.583
So even under the
stone's influence,

00:12:02.667 --> 00:12:05.000
you remembered what was
most important to you.

00:12:05.083 --> 00:12:06.250
I'm lucky.

00:12:06.333 --> 00:12:08.500
I met Inugami immediately
after coming here,

00:12:08.583 --> 00:12:11.250
so I made it out without
the women finding me.

00:12:11.333 --> 00:12:13.000
Surprised you got away safe.

00:12:13.083 --> 00:12:15.083
Well, first I collapsed
from hunger.

00:12:15.166 --> 00:12:17.166
But then some
humans rescued me.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.250
It was smooth
sailing from there.

00:12:19.333 --> 00:12:21.542
[INUGAMI chuckles]
Good thing you're cute, kid.

00:12:21.625 --> 00:12:23.041
Would you do me a favor?

00:12:23.125 --> 00:12:25.458
I'd like to know
about the nullstone.

00:12:25.542 --> 00:12:26.750
They're stuck together,

00:12:26.834 --> 00:12:30.166
but half of this was left
to me by my parents.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.959
t's my only real
connection to them

00:12:32.041 --> 00:12:34.208
and I could really
use another lead.

00:12:34.291 --> 00:12:36.208
Can you tell me about it?

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.458
The history of the
snowy village goes back

00:12:40.542 --> 00:12:42.625
about a thousand years.

00:12:42.709 --> 00:12:44.750
The nullstone is said to
have already been there

00:12:44.834 --> 00:12:46.291
at the beginning.

00:12:46.375 --> 00:12:47.959
They even say that
the village itself

00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:50.291
was created to enshrine it.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:53.542
Let me ask you.

00:12:53.625 --> 00:12:55.709
Have you heard about
the "Kemono Jihen?"

00:12:55.792 --> 00:12:59.083
"Jihen," like "incidents"? No.

00:12:59.166 --> 00:13:01.542
By "incidents," do you mean war?

00:13:01.625 --> 00:13:03.375
[AKIRA]
Uh-oh, this is getting heavy.

00:13:03.458 --> 00:13:05.000
I'm feeling sleepy!

00:13:05.083 --> 00:13:07.750
[INUGAMI] Yes, between
kemono and humans.

00:13:07.834 --> 00:13:09.583
Roughly a thousand years ago,

00:13:09.667 --> 00:13:11.709
putting it shortly before
the snowy village.

00:13:11.792 --> 00:13:13.709
Wait, you know about this stuff?

00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:15.667
If something like that
actually happened,

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.583
then wouldn't it mean the
existence of kemono

00:13:18.667 --> 00:13:20.083
has been known for a while?

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:21.834
[INUGAMI]
Kinda.

00:13:21.917 --> 00:13:24.083
We were known about
a long time ago,

00:13:24.166 --> 00:13:27.625
which is why war
initially broke out.

00:13:27.709 --> 00:13:30.000
Apparently, it got
pretty gruesome.

00:13:30.083 --> 00:13:33.291
The land was ravaged,
the rivers were contaminated,

00:13:33.375 --> 00:13:37.542
and many were injured or killed,
human and kemono alike.

00:13:37.625 --> 00:13:39.875
To repair the world,
the kemono mustered

00:13:39.959 --> 00:13:42.750
all they had to undo
the damage, and wipe

00:13:42.834 --> 00:13:46.792
the human's memories, hoping
to reset their relationship.

00:13:46.875 --> 00:13:50.166
That turning point allowed our
kind to hide in plain sight.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:53.458
It's a part of Japanese history
only kemono know about.

00:13:53.542 --> 00:13:56.000
The Kemono Jihen.

00:13:56.083 --> 00:13:57.500
That's wild.

00:13:57.583 --> 00:14:00.166
Of course you'd be familiar.
Should've guessed.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.750
[INUGAMI] My bad,
didn't mean to interrupt.

00:14:04.208 --> 00:14:07.667
A conflict like that can never
be allowed to happen again.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:11.250
Which is supposedly why the
kemono stones were created.

00:14:11.333 --> 00:14:13.333
The ones who imbued the
stones with their might

00:14:13.417 --> 00:14:16.458
were the most capable
kemono of their age.

00:14:16.542 --> 00:14:18.291
By passing them down
to their descendants

00:14:18.375 --> 00:14:19.917
and other native kemono,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.291
their goal was for us to
keep each other in line,

00:14:22.375 --> 00:14:24.792
and to preserve the
balance of power.

00:14:24.875 --> 00:14:27.709
So you mean they made weapons
in order to prevent fighting?

00:14:27.792 --> 00:14:29.375
Counter-productive.

00:14:29.458 --> 00:14:31.917
[INUGAMI] Kemono aren't
one big, happy family.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.250
Keeping everyone in line
through force works best.

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:38.083
If your parents left
that stone to you,

00:14:38.166 --> 00:14:40.709
it means either your mother
or father must have been

00:14:40.792 --> 00:14:42.917
a fairly prestigious
kemono chief.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.083
[BOTH gasp]

00:14:44.166 --> 00:14:46.166
[KABANE]
They were... a chief?

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:48.083
[INUGAMI] It's also possible
they were given it,

00:14:48.166 --> 00:14:49.208
or found it.

00:14:49.291 --> 00:14:50.959
[YUI]
Yeah, that could be true.

00:14:51.041 --> 00:14:53.291
[INUGAMI]
Wanna go find out?

00:14:53.375 --> 00:14:56.041
There are kemono stones
scattered all over Japan.

00:14:56.125 --> 00:14:57.375
And there's no question,

00:14:57.458 --> 00:14:59.917
your stone is one of those
extraordinary pieces.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.792
The families that pass
down such items

00:15:01.875 --> 00:15:03.875
tend to be pretty high
up on the food chain

00:15:03.959 --> 00:15:05.959
in their respective regions.

00:15:06.041 --> 00:15:07.375
If we go digging,

00:15:07.458 --> 00:15:09.667
I bet we'll find a clue or
two as to how your parents

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.083
got a hold of that.

00:15:12.166 --> 00:15:13.834
Hey, that's sick, man!

00:15:13.917 --> 00:15:15.792
Before now, they would
have been tight lipped

00:15:15.875 --> 00:15:17.583
if we came sniffing around.

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:19.000
That's true.

00:15:19.083 --> 00:15:21.375
If a stranger came up and
asked me about the stones,

00:15:21.458 --> 00:15:24.208
I likely wouldn't have
bothered responding.

00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:25.709
If you're lucky
enough to have one,

00:15:25.792 --> 00:15:27.959
the stones can be
your ace in the hole.

00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:30.458
Making the owners
talk is a tall order.

00:15:30.542 --> 00:15:33.834
But now, we have that.

00:15:33.917 --> 00:15:35.875
We can use the fact they
fuse with each other

00:15:35.959 --> 00:15:37.750
as a kind of bargaining chip.

00:15:37.834 --> 00:15:39.250
[AKIRA] Which makes us
one step closer

00:15:39.333 --> 00:15:41.709
to learning more about
Kabane's mom and dad!

00:15:41.792 --> 00:15:42.667
Sure does.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.208
[AKIRA]
Hooray!

00:15:44.291 --> 00:15:45.500
[SHIKI chuckles]

00:15:45.583 --> 00:15:46.875
[AKIRA giggles]

00:15:49.166 --> 00:15:51.208
[SHIKI, AKIRA]
Yay!

00:15:51.291 --> 00:15:53.166
[NOBIMARU]
You sure about this, ma'am?

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:55.625
Backing off as
quickly as we did?

00:15:55.709 --> 00:15:58.625
You mean after they
claimed ownership of it?

00:15:58.709 --> 00:16:01.625
I don't want any
trouble with the tanuki.

00:16:01.709 --> 00:16:04.166
At least, not yet. 'Kay?

00:16:05.709 --> 00:16:07.583
It's not as if I've
actually given up

00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:10.000
on the nullstone
or the lifestone.

00:16:10.083 --> 00:16:13.000
I just need to get my hands
on it in a way that the tanuki

00:16:13.083 --> 00:16:14.875
can't argue about.

00:16:14.959 --> 00:16:16.166
Understood.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:18.291
And we have just the
person for the job.

00:16:18.375 --> 00:16:21.625
[INARI giggles]
I can't wait.

00:16:23.083 --> 00:16:25.417
You can take the
nullstone with you.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.542
