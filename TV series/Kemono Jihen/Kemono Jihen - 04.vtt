I was going to have you join
these fellas before much longer.

It's pretty tough getting by
as a big city kitty, you know.

sure to look after you.

Just like your buddy over there.

This is weird, though.

If you aren't a cat yet,

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:20.750 position:50% align:center
that means you haven't
been entirely seduced.

Oh?

00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:25.714 position:50% align:center
He loves you.

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:27.215 position:50% align:center
Loves me?

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:30.218 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Well that's
a real shame, then!

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:31.845 position:50% align:center
As you can see, I'm a neko--

00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:34.347 position:50% align:center
Caught you.

[MAO grunts]

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:38.268 position:50% align:center
Woah. How'd you do that?

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.561 position:50% align:center
Pretty good.

[YORUNO gasps]

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:46.443 position:50% align:center
Okay, here's your target.
Now you can state your terms.

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:49.612 position:50% align:center

I-It feels crazy.

But you really are Mao,
aren't you?

00:08:58.079 --> 00:09:00.290 position:50% align:center
This may be weird,
but these are some mice

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.167 position:50% align:center
that I caught and have
been saving for you.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.461 position:50% align:center
Would you do me the honor
of accepting them?

[MAO gasps]

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:09.549 position:50% align:center
[YORUNO] Before I met you,
I was such a sad and lonely guy.

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:12.552 position:50% align:center
I didn't have any friends,
or even hobbies.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:14.679 position:50% align:center
I was always by myself.

00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:16.348 position:50% align:center
Going through the
motions every day

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:19.392 position:50% align:center
and trying to pretend
that was a life.

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:20.685 position:50% align:center
Mao, the thing is...

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:22.812 position:50% align:center
...you're the first ray
of light I've ever had.

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:25.523 position:50% align:center
That's the honest truth.

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:27.484 position:50% align:center
Please, will you
turn me into a cat?

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.779 position:50% align:center
From now on, I want
to live only for you.

00:09:30.862 --> 00:09:35.075 position:50% align:center
I don't have any attachment
to my human life. I promise.

[gasps lightly]

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:41.539 position:50% align:center
[KABANE] Do you think we
fulfilled the client's request?

[SHIKI]
Who knows?

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:45.960 position:50% align:center
But given the way things went...

Aw shoot, those
human-faced cats.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.757 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll need
to report 'em, huh?

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.094 position:50% align:center
You should know, I'm not leaving
until I have your head, Kabane.

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:56.262 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
Oh, that's right.

00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:58.807 position:50% align:center
How're you gonna solve
that one, Inugami?

00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:02.394 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
A deal is a deal.

00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:04.562 position:50% align:center
Okay, Kon, I want you
to close your eyes

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:05.939 position:50% align:center
until I say to open them.

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:08.692 position:50% align:center
[KON sighs]
Fine, understood.

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:13.405 position:50% align:center
Let's see... I guess
this will work.

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:17.158 position:50% align:center
[KON] Confirmed receipt.
I appreciate your cooperation.

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:19.160 position:50% align:center

She's gonna figure
it out in no time.

Oh, what does it matter?
After all, she's not a bad kid.

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:30.839 position:50% align:center
So. You learn anything on
the love front, Kabane?

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.132 position:50% align:center
Yup.

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:35.927 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
A pack of tissues?

00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:37.971 position:50% align:center
I got them when we
were on the way back.

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:40.390 position:50% align:center
And now, I want to
give them to you.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.767 position:50% align:center
I've learned that love
is a lot like light.

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:44.644 position:50% align:center
You've shown me life
can have meaning,

00:10:44.728 --> 00:10:46.604 position:50% align:center
and I think that's a
kinda light, too.

00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:49.524 position:50% align:center
I truly appreciate
that, Inugami.

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:52.235 position:50% align:center
Oh, and apparently,
people give others things

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.237 position:50% align:center
that will benefit them.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.199 position:50% align:center
Tissues are very handy, so I
believe they will benefit you.

Shiki and Akira, I think
you're also both lights.

00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:07.959 position:50% align:center
I'll give you things soon.

Oh, thanks!

Eh, good thinking kiddo.

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:17.302 position:50% align:center

actually got together?

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:18.803 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Yeah.

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:21.681 position:50% align:center
They just stopped by and dropped
off a gift and this photo.

00:11:21.765 --> 00:11:23.767 position:50% align:center
She says she has
enough to get by on,

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.268 position:50% align:center
and she's safe
and comfortable,

00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:27.604 position:50% align:center
since the two of them
live together now.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:30.023 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah. And those
cats with men's faces

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:32.108 position:50% align:center
should return to
normal in a week.

Yoruno seemed in good spirits.

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:36.488 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:40.033 position:50% align:center
I just don't get life sometimes.

[AKIRA]
Kabane's really something.

00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:45.497 position:50% align:center
He just got here, and he's
already done so much.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.291 position:50% align:center
Me, on the other hand. Well...

00:11:57.634 --> 00:11:59.594 position:50% align:center
You've become
Kabane's apprentice?

00:11:59.678 --> 00:12:01.137 position:50% align:center
Yep, that's right!

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
So, you can leave any case you
like up to me and my master!

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:05.433 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Wait, how did this happen?

00:12:05.517 --> 00:12:07.769 position:50% align:center
Yesterday, there was a
roach in the bathroom.

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:10.522 position:50% align:center
And when Akira broke
down crying for help.

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.816 position:50% align:center
Kabane showed up and
put it outside.

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:16.027 position:50% align:center
Once he did, Akira was like,
"Kabane is amazing."

00:12:16.111 --> 00:12:17.987 position:50% align:center
"He always comes through."

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.907 position:50% align:center
And when I mentioned that's how
Kabane should feel about us,

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.742 position:50% align:center
somehow this is
where we ended up.

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:23.993 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:26.204 position:50% align:center
We'll handle whatever
comes our way!

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:28.248 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Hm...

00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:31.334 position:50% align:center
There is one job
that just came in.

00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:34.254 position:50% align:center
It's something I was gonna
take Kabane along to do.

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:36.381 position:50% align:center
But Akira, if you're
up for it, it's yours.

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:37.716 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:39.217 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Yeah.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.469 position:50% align:center
There's a river that flows
under Shibuya, and right now, 

00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:43.430 position:50% align:center
they're doing some
work to divert it.

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:46.474 position:50% align:center
But some of the workers have
been meeting unnatural deaths.

00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50% align:center
The case is to investigate why.

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:49.978 position:50% align:center
Unnatural?

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:52.439 position:50% align:center
The Shibuya River is so
covered up by buildings,

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:55.483 position:50% align:center
it's almost a sewer.
Hard pass on that one.

00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:58.778 position:50% align:center
Can't really blame ya.
It's bound to be scary.

00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:01.740 position:50% align:center
And pretty disgusting.
It's a gnarly gig.

Uh, ah... I don't have
a problem, either.

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:11.166 position:50% align:center
But I'm feeling a
little out of sorts,

00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:13.626 position:50% align:center
so can I just take a
quick bath first?

Man, this is hopeless.

I think you'd better
call it off.

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
Lets see what happens.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.808 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI] Word is that the
victims were all found

00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:30.894 position:50% align:center
as skeletonized remains.

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:33.104 position:50% align:center
I think I know who
the culprit is.

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:36.316 position:50% align:center
The Shibuya River is known to
have indigenous inhabitants.

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:38.151 position:50% align:center
First they put all those
buildings over it,

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
covering it up.

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:41.905 position:50% align:center
And now it's being split
apart and diverted.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:44.115 position:50% align:center
I'm not surprised
that they're angry.

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:45.658 position:50% align:center
I would be too.

00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:50.288 position:50% align:center

Kabane, I'm here!

00:13:50.372 --> 00:13:52.248 position:50% align:center
Sorry to make you wait!

Am I supposed to know you?

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:58.171 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Oh, come on. It's me, Akira!

00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:01.341 position:50% align:center
The dirty and gross stuff won't
bother me dressed like this!

00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:02.592 position:50% align:center

Hold on a second.

It's dark in there,
and the ground is slippery,

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:09.182 position:50% align:center

where you're going--

Ouch!

Akira, are you okay?

00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:20.235 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA] Ooh, this really
is dark and scary.

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:22.654 position:50% align:center
First, let's locate these
indigenous inhabitants

No, you can't do that.

If you were to scream,

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:35.792 position:50% align:center
it could end up provoking
the creatures here.

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.669 position:50% align:center
And then they could attack us.
