00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:15.640 position:50% align:center
[YORUNO] Hey bartender,
you're a detective, too?

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:18.059 position:50% align:center
That works out perfectly.

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:20.478 position:50% align:center
No bartender, just a dude.

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:23.064 position:50% align:center
And that's my own stash,
so stop chuggin' it.

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:25.859 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it, I don't
remember anyone mentioning

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:28.486 position:50% align:center
why half of the office
is set up like a bar.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.613 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
It's a relic of the past.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.407 position:50% align:center
Before Inugami took us in,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.868 position:50% align:center
he apparently ran the
agency with a partner.

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:37.454 position:50% align:center
He says the bar schtick
was their thing.

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.289 position:50% align:center
He's not that interested
in running it,

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:40.832 position:50% align:center
so he lets it be.

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:42.250 position:50% align:center
A partner?

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:43.710 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI] We don't know
where they are now, 

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:45.253 position:50% align:center
but keep it to yourself.

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:46.838 position:50% align:center
It's a sensitive subject.

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:48.548 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Mm. I understand.

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:52.427 position:50% align:center
[YORUNO] Whatever! I just
need someone to listen!

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.515 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:25.895 position:50% align:center
There's this wonderful
woman I really like.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.188 position:50% align:center
But the truth is,

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:29.566 position:50% align:center
I don't actually know the
first thing about her.

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.943 position:50% align:center
Not her real name,
or how to reach her.

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:33.528 position:50% align:center
Maybe she's just not into you?

00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:37.407 position:50% align:center
[YORUNO] No, that's not true!
She's always so nice to me!

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.368 position:50% align:center
But I need to know so
much more about her.

00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:43.246 position:50% align:center
If only I could tell her how
much my heart aches for her.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.248 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA] Sounds like you
love a coy woman!

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:46.833 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's right, I love her!

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:48.168 position:50% align:center
His love's coy?

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:49.252 position:50% align:center
[KON]
Koi?

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:50.962 position:50% align:center
[YORUNO]
I gotta go take a leak.

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:52.797 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
S'back there.

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:54.549 position:50% align:center
[KON]
I happen to love koi, too!

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:57.635 position:50% align:center
The ones down at the park are
especially plump and tasty.

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.763 position:50% align:center
She's not that kind of koi!

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:03.350 position:50% align:center
It's sweet, huh?
We should give this guy a hand!

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.852 position:50% align:center
There's nothing better
than a good love story!

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:08.897 position:50% align:center
And besides, even you were
born out of the love between 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.274 position:50% align:center
your human father and
kemono mother, weren't you?

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:14.152 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI grunts]
Gross! Don't talk about that!

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:16.905 position:50% align:center
Shiki was born out of love?

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:19.991 position:50% align:center
Hey. Is something wrong, Kabane?

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:21.743 position:50% align:center
It's what Akira said.

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:25.413 position:50% align:center
That hanyo are born out of love
between humans and kemono?

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:26.706 position:50% align:center
That makes me think.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50% align:center
If I learn about love,

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:30.543 position:50% align:center
maybe I'll understand
my parents better.

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:32.128 position:50% align:center
If I go with that gentleman,

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.130 position:50% align:center
do you think I'll be
able to find love?

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:35.715 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:39.636 position:50% align:center
Honestly, that depends on you.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.054 position:50% align:center
If you think you're up for it,

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:43.598 position:50% align:center
I'd be happy to give you
this case to work on.

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:45.266 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Yes, please. I'd like that.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.811 position:50% align:center
Done. Hey, Shiki. Akira.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.688 position:50% align:center
I expect you to
offer him support.

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:51.398 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a blast.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.066 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
And, uh, kitsune girl.

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:54.150 position:50% align:center
It's Kon.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.027 position:50% align:center
Kon, right. You're still
hanging around

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:57.862 position:50% align:center
cause you want
Kabane's head, yeah?

00:03:57.946 --> 00:03:59.698 position:50% align:center
Well, if you'll help out
with this next job,

00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:01.241 position:50% align:center
I'll give it to you as a reward.

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:02.200 position:50% align:center
Do you really mean that?

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:04.994 position:50% align:center
Inugami, what're you saying?

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:08.164 position:50% align:center
You cannot be serious, right?
You do have something in mind?

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.000 position:50% align:center
Don't blow a
blood vessel, buddy.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.377 position:50% align:center
Besides. If you're
learning about love,

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.587 position:50% align:center
it might help to have
multiple perspectives.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:17.507 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI] You're getting a kick
out of this, aren't you?

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.967 position:50% align:center
[gasps lightly]

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.469 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI] Sir. If you're
comfortable with my associates,

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:24.055 position:50% align:center
we can assist you with your
romantic troubles, cheap.

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.306 position:50% align:center
Sound good?

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.518 position:50% align:center
But they're children.
That's not gonna work.

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:30.687 position:50% align:center
[KABANE] I promise we will
accomplish our mission.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.815 position:50% align:center
Sure, but that's not
what the issue is.

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:35.942 position:50% align:center
Nah, whatever.

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:37.861 position:50% align:center
Does tomorrow work
for you guys?

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.988 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way,
my name is Yoruno.

Sorry about that.

When I saw the mouse,
I couldn't stop myself.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:02.552 position:50% align:center
It's just that I'm collecting
these things so someday,

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:04.220 position:50% align:center
I can gift them to my girl.

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:12.187 position:50% align:center

of a nekomata.

A kemono that turns into
an attractive human

to seduce people.

I doubt this love
will bear fruit.

00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:22.072 position:50% align:center
I don't understand. Is love
something that grows on trees?

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:23.948 position:50% align:center
Hard to explain, but sure.

for you. Head, please.

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center
All right, kid. I think it's
time for a little review

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:32.832 position:50% align:center
of what this job actually is.

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:37.420 position:50% align:center

That was horrifying.

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.047 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Akira.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.341 position:50% align:center
You should think about
sitting this one out.

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:43.843 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Huh? But why?

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:47.430 position:50% align:center
You've never been great with
"scary" or "disgusting" stuff.

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:48.932 position:50% align:center
If you guys were in a pinch,

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.601 position:50% align:center
could you help if it
meant facing your fear?

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:54.354 position:50% align:center
Well. I don't know.

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:55.480 position:50% align:center
Why don't you give me a hand

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:58.274 position:50% align:center
around the office
tomorrow, 'kay?

00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:02.862 position:50% align:center
So, I'm just in the way, then?

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:05.198 position:50% align:center
No, of course not,
not in the least.

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:08.493 position:50% align:center
If we face something cute,
you're our guy, right, champ?

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:10.412 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess that's true!

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50% align:center
I'll do my best with
the office work.

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:14.499 position:50% align:center

Mature audiences!

Uh, what does that mean?

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.762 position:50% align:center
To be "Mature" means to
be ripe or fully-grown.

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:29.389 position:50% align:center
I read it in the paper.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:31.057 position:50% align:center
What's the woman called?

00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:33.893 position:50% align:center
Just Mao. This is her.

Kay, we're goin' in.

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:36.312 position:50% align:center
H-Hold on!

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.023 position:50% align:center
Why? We're not getting
anything done here.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:40.567 position:50% align:center
You haven't thought things
through at all, that's why!

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.277 position:50% align:center
It's an establishment
for adults,

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.903 position:50% align:center
so children can't go in.

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:45.488 position:50% align:center

Besides,

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:49.200 position:50% align:center
her shift should be wrapping
up any minute now.

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:50.910 position:50% align:center
But it's the strangest thing.

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:52.495 position:50% align:center
I've waited for her
outside before,

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.664 position:50% align:center
but I've never
actually seen her, like,

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:56.791 position:50% align:center
walk out of the building.

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50% align:center
A cat.

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:04.466 position:50% align:center
We're dealing with a nekomata.
Guess that checks out.

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:06.301 position:50% align:center
Cool, should we go
catch it and eat it?

Oh, the kemonoist?
I've heard stories about him.

00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:33.912 position:50% align:center
Is there something special
you need from me?

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:35.914 position:50% align:center
We have a client
here named Yoruno.

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:38.124 position:50% align:center
He says he's fallen in love
with you and that he wants

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:40.377 position:50% align:center
to know more about you,
so we're helping him.

I was going to have you join
these fellas before much longer.

It's pretty tough getting by
as a big city kitty, you know.

sure to look after you.

Just like your buddy over there.

This is weird, though.

If you aren't a cat yet,

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:20.750 position:50% align:center
that means you haven't
been entirely seduced.

Oh?

00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:25.714 position:50% align:center
He loves you.

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:27.215 position:50% align:center
Loves me?

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:30.218 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Well that's
a real shame, then!

As you can see, I'm a neko--

00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:34.347 position:50% align:center
Caught you.

[MAO grunts]

Woah. How'd you do that?

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.561 position:50% align:center
Pretty good.

Okay, here's your target.
Now you can state your terms.

But you really are Mao,
aren't you?

00:08:58.079 --> 00:09:00.290 position:50% align:center
This may be weird,
but these are some mice

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.167 position:50% align:center
that I caught and have
been saving for you.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.461 position:50% align:center
Would you do me the honor

[MAO gasps]

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:09.549 position:50% align:center
[YORUNO] Before I met you,
I was such a sad and lonely guy.

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:12.552 position:50% align:center
I didn't have any friends,
or even hobbies.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:14.679 position:50% align:center
I was always by myself.

00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:16.348 position:50% align:center
Going through the
motions every day

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:19.392 position:50% align:center
and trying to pretend
that was a life.

Mao, the thing is...

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:22.812 position:50% align:center
...you're the first ray
of light I've ever had.

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:25.523 position:50% align:center
That's the honest truth.

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:27.484 position:50% align:center
Please, will you
turn me into a cat?

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.779 position:50% align:center
From now on, I want
to live only for you.

00:09:30.862 --> 00:09:35.075 position:50% align:center
I don't have any attachment
to my human life. I promise.

fulfilled the client's request?

Who knows?

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:45.960 position:50% align:center
But given the way things went...

Aw shoot, those
human-faced cats.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.757 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll need
to report 'em, huh?

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.094 position:50% align:center
You should know, I'm not leaving
until I have your head, Kabane.

[SHIKI]
Oh, that's right.

00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:58.807 position:50% align:center
How're you gonna solve
that one, Inugami?

00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:02.394 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
A deal is a deal.

00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:04.562 position:50% align:center
Okay, Kon, I want you
to close your eyes

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:05.939 position:50% align:center
until I say to open them.

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:08.692 position:50% align:center

Fine, understood.

Let's see... I guess
this will work.

[KON] Confirmed receipt.
I appreciate your cooperation.

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:19.160 position:50% align:center

it out in no time.

Oh, what does it matter?
After all, she's not a bad kid.

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:30.839 position:50% align:center
So. You learn anything on
the love front, Kabane?

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.132 position:50% align:center
Yup.

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:35.927 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
A pack of tissues?

00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:37.971 position:50% align:center
I got them when we
were on the way back.

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:40.390 position:50% align:center
And now, I want to
give them to you.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.767 position:50% align:center
I've learned that love
is a lot like light.

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:44.644 position:50% align:center
You've shown me life
can have meaning,

00:10:44.728 --> 00:10:46.604 position:50% align:center
and I think that's a
kinda light, too.

00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:49.524 position:50% align:center
I truly appreciate
that, Inugami.

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:52.235 position:50% align:center
Oh, and apparently,
people give others things

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.237 position:50% align:center
that will benefit them.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.199 position:50% align:center
Tissues are very handy, so I
believe they will benefit you.

Shiki and Akira, I think
you're also both lights.

Oh, thanks!

Yeah.

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:21.681 position:50% align:center
They just stopped by and dropped
off a gift and this photo.

She says she has
enough to get by on,

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.268 position:50% align:center
and she's safe
and comfortable,

00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:27.604 position:50% align:center
since the two of them
live together now.

Oh yeah. And those
cats with men's faces

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:32.108 position:50% align:center

normal in a week.

Are you serious?

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:40.033 position:50% align:center
I just don't get life sometimes.

Kabane's really something.

00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:45.497 position:50% align:center
He just got here, and he's
already done so much.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.291 position:50% align:center
Me, on the other hand. Well...

00:11:57.634 --> 00:11:59.594 position:50% align:center
You've become
Kabane's apprentice?

00:11:59.678 --> 00:12:01.137 position:50% align:center
Yep, that's right!

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
So, you can leave any case you
like up to me and my master!

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:05.433 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Wait, how did this happen?

00:12:05.517 --> 00:12:07.769 position:50% align:center
Yesterday, there was a
roach in the bathroom.

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:10.522 position:50% align:center
And when Akira broke
down crying for help.

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.816 position:50% align:center
Kabane showed up and
put it outside.

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:16.027 position:50% align:center
Once he did, Akira was like,
"Kabane is amazing."

00:12:16.111 --> 00:12:17.987 position:50% align:center
"He always comes through."

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.907 position:50% align:center
And when I mentioned that's how
Kabane should feel about us,

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.742 position:50% align:center
somehow this is
where we ended up.

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:23.993 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:26.204 position:50% align:center
We'll handle whatever
comes our way!

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:28.248 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Hm...

00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:31.334 position:50% align:center
There is one job
that just came in.

00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:34.254 position:50% align:center
It's something I was gonna
take Kabane along to do.

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:36.381 position:50% align:center
But Akira, if you're
up for it, it's yours.

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:37.716 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:39.217 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Yeah.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.469 position:50% align:center
There's a river that flows
under Shibuya, and right now, 

00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:43.430 position:50% align:center
they're doing some
work to divert it.

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:46.474 position:50% align:center
But some of the workers have
been meeting unnatural deaths.

00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50% align:center
The case is to investigate why.

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:49.978 position:50% align:center
Unnatural?

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:52.439 position:50% align:center
The Shibuya River is so
covered up by buildings,

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:55.483 position:50% align:center
it's almost a sewer.
Hard pass on that one.

00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:58.778 position:50% align:center
Can't really blame ya.
It's bound to be scary.

00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:01.740 position:50% align:center
And pretty disgusting.
It's a gnarly gig.

Uh, ah... I don't have
a problem, either.

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:11.166 position:50% align:center
But I'm feeling a
little out of sorts,

00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:13.626 position:50% align:center
so can I just take a
quick bath first?

Man, this is hopeless.

I think you'd better
call it off.

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
Lets see what happens.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.808 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI] Word is that the
victims were all found

00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:30.894 position:50% align:center
as skeletonized remains.

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:33.104 position:50% align:center
I think I know who
the culprit is.

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:36.316 position:50% align:center
The Shibuya River is known to
have indigenous inhabitants.

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:38.151 position:50% align:center
First they put all those
buildings over it,

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
covering it up.

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:41.905 position:50% align:center
And now it's being split
apart and diverted.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:44.115 position:50% align:center
I'm not surprised
that they're angry.

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:45.658 position:50% align:center
I would be too.

00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:50.288 position:50% align:center

Kabane, I'm here!

00:13:50.372 --> 00:13:52.248 position:50% align:center
Sorry to make you wait!

Am I supposed to know you?

Oh, come on. It's me, Akira!

00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:01.341 position:50% align:center

bother me dressed like this!

It's dark in there,
and the ground is slippery,

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:09.182 position:50% align:center

where you're going--

Ouch!

Akira, are you okay?

00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:20.235 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA] Ooh, this really
is dark and scary.

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:22.654 position:50% align:center
First, let's locate these
indigenous inhabitants

No, you can't do that.

If you were to scream,

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:35.792 position:50% align:center
it could end up provoking
the creatures here.

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.669 position:50% align:center
And then they could attack us.

Wow. Amazing.

Instead of killing them,
you just let them go.

00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:08.074 position:50% align:center
And you did that
with the roach, too.

00:15:08.158 --> 00:15:10.827 position:50% align:center

they don't give me a choice.

we're all in the same boat.

Mm-hm. My twin brother.

You see, when I
came to Inugami's,

00:15:35.894 --> 00:15:37.979 position:50% align:center
I was hoping to
meet up with him.

00:15:38.063 --> 00:15:40.899 position:50% align:center
Our clan, we're
called yuki-onoko.

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:44.319 position:50% align:center
And all of us live together,
deep in the mountains of Aomori.

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA] Our snowy little village
has a rather unique system.

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:51.618 position:50% align:center
It's all female, and males
of the clan are only born

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:53.745 position:50% align:center
once every hundred years.

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:56.831 position:50% align:center
Now that I think about it, maybe
that's why the other villagers

00:15:56.915 --> 00:15:59.334 position:50% align:center
used to give us both
funny looks all of the time.

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:00.960 position:50% align:center
Not much has changed
since then,

00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:03.004 position:50% align:center
I was a weakling who
did nothing but cry

00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:05.715 position:50% align:center
and my brother was always
trying to cheer me up.

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:07.300 position:50% align:center
I'll always keep you safe.

00:16:07.384 --> 00:16:08.968 position:50% align:center
I don't want you to
become tainted.

00:16:09.052 --> 00:16:10.345 position:50% align:center
And once we grow up,

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:12.514 position:50% align:center
we'll leave this damn place
and start a new life.

00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:16.351 position:50% align:center
Wasn't that super cool of him?

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:18.645 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, as we were
fleeing the village,

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:20.814 position:50% align:center
we ended up getting separated.

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:22.982 position:50% align:center
But I figure if I'm
alive and kickin',

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:25.777 position:50% align:center
then I have to believe
that my brother is too.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.821 position:50% align:center
Yuki-onoko are snow kemono.

00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:30.949 position:50% align:center
So does that mean you have the
power to control ice and stuff?

00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:34.285 position:50% align:center
Oh. Uh-huh. But it
requires lotsa focus.

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:36.621 position:50% align:center
Which has never been my
strong suit, honestly,

00:16:36.705 --> 00:16:38.373 position:50% align:center
so I'm not all that good at it.

00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:41.001 position:50% align:center
'Bout all I can do is
freeze the water's surface.

00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:42.210 position:50% align:center
That's pretty incredible.

Seriously?

00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:48.091 position:50% align:center
Okay, uh, I guess maybe I
can give it a quick try.

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:49.884 position:50% align:center
I haven't done this in
a really long time,

00:16:49.968 --> 00:16:51.511 position:50% align:center
so I'm a little rusty.

00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:54.055 position:50% align:center
Wait. On second thought,
if I freeze any of it,

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:56.599 position:50% align:center
then all the things living
underneath might die.

00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:58.768 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:16:58.852 --> 00:17:01.021 position:50% align:center

of a bummer.
