00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.784 position:50% align:center
and let us clean
up our own mess--

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:15.829 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:20.917 position:50% align:center
[REIKA screams]

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:32.971 position:50% align:center
[REIKA] My little sisters were
devious and spoiled rotten.

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:34.639 position:50% align:center
And they made me
look like a jerk

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:38.268 position:50% align:center
for being the only one
taking this seriously.

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.561 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI, AKIRA gasp]

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:43.398 position:50% align:center
[REIKA] But this is my
precious food pantry.

00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:47.235 position:50% align:center
And I'm not about to let a
bunch of nosy brats have it.

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:57.579 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA whimpers]

00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:00.957 position:50% align:center
No choice now.

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:03.084 position:50% align:center
[REIKA laughs]
What was that?

00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:05.045 position:50% align:center
Are you trying to blind me?

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:06.921 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:09.257 position:50% align:center
[REIKA]
My, what a naughty boy!

00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:11.843 position:50% align:center
Going straight for
my vitals like that.

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:16.723 position:50% align:center
[REIKA] It's time for you
to learn some manners.

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:17.974 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
She's tough!

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:22.062 position:50% align:center
--[AKIRA gasps]
--Kabane!

00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:25.357 position:50% align:center
[REIKA] You could have
gone right back home

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.609 position:50% align:center
without any of this fuss,

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:30.695 position:50% align:center
but you had to make
the grown-up angry.

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:33.406 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.242 position:50% align:center
[REIKA] You're a tough
little cookie, huh?

00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:38.286 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
All right.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.413 position:50% align:center
Hold her there for me, okay?

00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:42.123 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:45.043 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
No, Shiki! Are you okay?

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:46.836 position:50% align:center
Monster! I'll...

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.338 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:55.470 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Shoot, I forgot I can't
make ice without water!

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:57.514 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.849 position:50% align:center
Shiki! Akira!

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50% align:center
[REIKA]
Nice friends you have there.

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:03.019 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:05.355 position:50% align:center
[REIKA] It'll be so sweet
when you all die together.

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:06.856 position:50% align:center
[KABANE gasps]

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.275 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
I have to keep training myself.

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:11.444 position:50% align:center
I may not be able to die,

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:15.365 position:50% align:center
but I'd hate not being able
to protect the others.

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.158 position:50% align:center
This woman just killed
her own sisters

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:18.785 position:50% align:center
without a second thought.

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:23.081 position:50% align:center
If she beats me, she'll kill
both Shiki and Akira, too.

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:25.875 position:50% align:center
I don't see any way
to defeat her, though.

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:28.920 position:50% align:center
At this point, their
deaths seem unavoidable.

00:10:29.004 --> 00:10:30.755 position:50% align:center
[REIKA]
It's no use.

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:33.049 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
So why am I doing this?

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:36.845 position:50% align:center
In my mind, I know resisting
her won't change the situation.

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:38.304 position:50% align:center
It's hopeless.

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:42.475 position:50% align:center
And yet... my body is
refusing to back down.

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:51.067 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:52.986 position:50% align:center
[REIKA]
Look at you showing off.

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:54.738 position:50% align:center
You just broke your own arm!

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:58.074 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:00.118 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI]
No, no, you're doing it wrong.

00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:03.329 position:50% align:center
All you'll accomplish that way
is destroying your own body.

00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:05.415 position:50% align:center
Mihai, what are you...?

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.250 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI] Inugami's going
to get all pissy with me

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:09.377 position:50% align:center
if you three are finished off.

00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:11.921 position:50% align:center
Let me give you a
little free advice.

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:13.548 position:50% align:center
Pay attention, Kabane.

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:15.216 position:50% align:center
The reason you can't win,

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.260 position:50% align:center
against me or against
that kemono,

00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:19.888 position:50% align:center
is because you're only using
your human strength.

00:11:19.971 --> 00:11:22.057 position:50% align:center
Use your kemono strength.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.309 position:50% align:center
What do you mean,
"kemono strength"?

00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:27.354 position:50% align:center
[REIKA] Are you're really
holding a strategy session?

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:28.730 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI] You have to try
and forget the fact

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:30.190 position:50% align:center
that you're half human.

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:31.816 position:50% align:center
Just follow your instincts.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.651 position:50% align:center
Follow my instincts.

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:36.237 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI] Think about it
in the simplest terms.

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:38.865 position:50% align:center
What's the thing you
want most right now?

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:40.950 position:50% align:center
Beating her is all
I care about.

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:42.160 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI]
Good.

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:44.496 position:50% align:center
Cuz I don't want to
lose Shiki and Akira.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:48.041 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI] That's it.
<i>That</i> is your instinct.

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:48.917 position:50% align:center
Your heart.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.754 position:50% align:center
[KABANE gasps, yells]

00:11:57.842 --> 00:11:59.052 position:50% align:center
[REIKA gasps]

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:07.560 position:50% align:center
[REIKA screams]

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:11.231 position:50% align:center
Wait, no! It can't be!

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.441 position:50% align:center
This... This isn't happening!

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:21.574 position:50% align:center
[KABANE] This is it.
That beastly power I had.

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:27.664 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
But now I can control it.

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:30.709 position:50% align:center
Is it 'cause I have
the lifestone?

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:33.211 position:50% align:center
When Yataro took it from me,
it felt like I was being

00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:36.923 position:50% align:center
swallowed up by something
I didn't understand.

00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:40.176 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI] <i>That</i> is your instinct.
Your heart.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:45.181 position:50% align:center
So I guess... the thing I've
never understood is... my heart?

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:47.142 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI]
Whattya know, you did it.

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:49.227 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Mihai...

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.022 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI] That power is a
kemono's true essence.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.149 position:50% align:center
It should become second-nature.

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:56.901 position:50% align:center
I still don't really get
what it is, though.

00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:01.489 position:50% align:center
Oh, I've gone back to normal.

00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:03.033 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI]
Because the danger's passed.

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:04.534 position:50% align:center
It has?

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.954 position:50% align:center
[KABANE] I should probably pull
off your other legs, to be safe.

00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:08.955 position:50% align:center
[REIKA]
No!

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:10.457 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Kabane!

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.666 position:50% align:center
Hey, you're here.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.586 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Mihai just caught
me up on everything.

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:17.047 position:50% align:center
You've done well,
but enough is enough.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.631 position:50% align:center
Come back now.

00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:20.967 position:50% align:center
Seriously, I grant you freedom,
and this is the thanks I get?

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:21.968 position:50% align:center
Will you shut up?

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:23.595 position:50% align:center
We can't leave, they're alive.

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:25.430 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
That's all right, kiddo.

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:28.308 position:50% align:center
We're only hired to
investigate, remember?

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:30.643 position:50% align:center
Inari will take care
of things from here.

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:35.148 position:50% align:center
Though I'm 100% sure that she is
going to be 100% pissed by this.

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:36.858 position:50% align:center
[NOBIMARU]
You can bet on that.

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:40.862 position:50% align:center
[NOBIMARU] I mean, really,
mere kanonba keeping humans

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:43.698 position:50% align:center
behind a kitsune's back?

00:13:43.782 --> 00:13:46.701 position:50% align:center
Good evening! It's a
pleasure to meet you.

00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:48.536 position:50% align:center
You must be Kabane, right?

00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:51.664 position:50% align:center
[NOBIMARU] Honored to
make your acquaintance.

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:55.502 position:50% align:center
My turn! I'm Nobimaru,
and I work for Lady Inari.

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:57.712 position:50% align:center
I look forward to collaborating.

00:13:57.796 --> 00:13:59.297 position:50% align:center
Who's the kid in the shorts?

00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:00.965 position:50% align:center
Hey, speak of the devil.

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:03.301 position:50% align:center
Do you mind if I have a
take a peep over there?

00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:05.845 position:50% align:center
It's still dangerous,
so keep back.

00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:07.347 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's fine.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.474 position:50% align:center
All right, now.
Please don't move.

00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:13.603 position:50% align:center
No! Stop!

00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:15.355 position:50% align:center
There! All ready to rock.

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:16.898 position:50% align:center
[REIKA]
Leave me alone!

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:21.778 position:50% align:center
[REIKA screams]

00:14:22.654 --> 00:14:24.489 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Just ashes...

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:26.574 position:50% align:center
We can't leave
evidence behind, can we?

00:14:26.658 --> 00:14:29.494 position:50% align:center
I'll get rid of the
other two, as well.

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:31.663 position:50% align:center
And... that's because
humans can't find out

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.373 position:50% align:center
about kemono affairs?

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:34.457 position:50% align:center
[NOBIMARU]
Correct.

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:35.750 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, there are
a lot of humans

00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:37.252 position:50% align:center
involved in this incident,

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:40.046 position:50% align:center
which means covering it up
completely would be difficult.

00:14:41.256 --> 00:14:42.549 position:50% align:center
[NOBIMARU]
We've no choice here.

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:44.926 position:50% align:center
The CEO is going to have
to take responsibility

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:46.428 position:50% align:center
for what occurred.

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:47.721 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
I see.

00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:55.645 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh. You're not,
by any chance,

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:58.106 position:50% align:center
feeling sorry for
them now, are you?

00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:01.568 position:50% align:center
They gave us no choice
but to kill them.

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:05.030 position:50% align:center
But total extermination
does feel harsh.

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:08.950 position:50% align:center
Death's one thing, but acting
like they never... lived?

00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:10.577 position:50% align:center
And, honestly, I don't
know what it's like

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.412 position:50% align:center
to feel sorry for someone,

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:15.290 position:50% align:center
but I don't want them to
be spared, so you do you.

00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:18.043 position:50% align:center
[NOBIMARU laughs]
Glad to hear it.

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:20.545 position:50% align:center
What about the people
working in the factory?

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:23.214 position:50% align:center
Well, as long as they're
still alive, we can help.

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:25.925 position:50% align:center
And we intend to, so you
don't have to worry.

00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:27.761 position:50% align:center
We kitsune are quite civilized.

00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:30.555 position:50% align:center
We're not looking to shrink
humanity's population.

00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:32.182 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Okay, good to know.

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:34.726 position:50% align:center
It'd be best if you go on
ahead and hurry home, now.

00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:37.479 position:50% align:center
I'm worried about
the spiky-haired one.

00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:40.815 position:50% align:center
He's injured and showing
signs of dehydration.

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:42.859 position:50% align:center
He probably overused his powers.

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:45.612 position:50% align:center
