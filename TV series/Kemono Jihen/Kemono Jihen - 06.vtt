Deep down, I'm terrified.

So much scares me.

I can sorta recall
living with my mom

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.314 position:50% align:center
back when I was a kid, but...

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:27.110 position:50% align:center
...I can't remember how we
ended up getting separated.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.821 position:50% align:center
And if I've got no memory of it,

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:34.242 position:50% align:center
whatever happened must've
been absolutely horrifying.

[MIHAI] So sorry.

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.050 position:50% align:center
My hand slipped while
I was steering,

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:16.302 position:50% align:center
and the enemy was
alerted to our presence.

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.054 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, it was an accident.

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:20.932 position:50% align:center
You're surprisingly
clumsy, huh, Mihai?

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:24.102 position:50% align:center
I did hack into the building's
security system, though.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.189 position:50% align:center
Hurry it up. He's in danger.

00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:29.941 position:50% align:center
Will do.

Crap. I can't move.

00:02:41.202 --> 00:02:44.414 position:50% align:center
I don't have to fight,
just run away.

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:46.791 position:50% align:center
So what am I doing?

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:48.084 position:50% align:center
Move

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.462 position:50% align:center
When I was researching
mimicry on the web,

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.672 position:50% align:center
I watched a video on mosquitos.

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:54.132 position:50% align:center
Mosquitos are tricky.

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:57.385 position:50% align:center
They have a component in
their saliva that numbs pain.

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:59.304 position:50% align:center
It allows them to suck
their victim's blood

00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:01.306 position:50% align:center
without being noticed.

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:04.142 position:50% align:center
So the good news is you
shouldn't feel any discomfort

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:06.811 position:50% align:center
as your blood and organs
are being sucked out.

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:09.814 position:50% align:center
No sensation at all, as your
consciousness fades

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:12.650 position:50% align:center
away and you
shrivel up and die.

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.569 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
No. Make it all stop.

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:16.780 position:50% align:center
I hate feeling like this.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.574 position:50% align:center

I can't!

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:22.160 position:50% align:center

You should really be ashamed
of this sorry display.

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:45.850 position:50% align:center
How will he feel about it?

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:47.185 position:50% align:center
Disappointed?

00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:48.311 position:50% align:center
Contemptuous?

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:49.979 position:50% align:center
Disgusted?

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.440 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI] I can't wait
to see his reaction.

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:53.733 position:50% align:center
Don't.

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:58.154 position:50% align:center

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:17.716 position:50% align:center
I should probably report this
to my sister, but whatever.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.784 position:50% align:center
and let us clean
up our own mess--

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:15.829 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:20.917 position:50% align:center
[REIKA screams]

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:32.971 position:50% align:center
[REIKA] My little sisters were
devious and spoiled rotten.

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:34.639 position:50% align:center
And they made me
look like a jerk

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:38.268 position:50% align:center
for being the only one
taking this seriously.

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.561 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI, AKIRA gasp]

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:43.398 position:50% align:center
[REIKA] But this is my
precious food pantry.

00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:47.235 position:50% align:center
And I'm not about to let a
bunch of nosy brats have it.

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:57.579 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA whimpers]

00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:00.957 position:50% align:center
No choice now.

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:03.084 position:50% align:center
[REIKA laughs]
What was that?

00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:05.045 position:50% align:center
Are you trying to blind me?

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:06.921 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:09.257 position:50% align:center
[REIKA]
My, what a naughty boy!

00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:11.843 position:50% align:center
Going straight for
my vitals like that.

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:16.723 position:50% align:center
[REIKA] It's time for you
to learn some manners.

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:17.974 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
She's tough!

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:22.062 position:50% align:center
--[AKIRA gasps]
--Kabane!

00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:25.357 position:50% align:center
[REIKA] You could have
gone right back home

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.609 position:50% align:center
without any of this fuss,

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:30.695 position:50% align:center
but you had to make
the grown-up angry.

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:33.406 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.242 position:50% align:center
[REIKA] You're a tough
little cookie, huh?

00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:38.286 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
All right.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.413 position:50% align:center
Hold her there for me, okay?

00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:42.123 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:45.043 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
No, Shiki! Are you okay?

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:46.836 position:50% align:center
Monster! I'll...

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.338 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:55.470 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Shoot, I forgot I can't
make ice without water!

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:57.514 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.849 position:50% align:center
Shiki! Akira!

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50% align:center
[REIKA]
Nice friends you have there.

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:03.019 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:05.355 position:50% align:center
[REIKA] It'll be so sweet
when you all die together.

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:06.856 position:50% align:center
[KABANE gasps]

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.275 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
I have to keep training myself.

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:11.444 position:50% align:center
I may not be able to die,

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:15.365 position:50% align:center
but I'd hate not being able
to protect the others.

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.158 position:50% align:center
This woman just killed
her own sisters

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:18.785 position:50% align:center
without a second thought.

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:23.081 position:50% align:center
If she beats me, she'll kill
both Shiki and Akira, too.

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:25.875 position:50% align:center
I don't see any way
to defeat her, though.

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:28.920 position:50% align:center
At this point, their
deaths seem unavoidable.

00:10:29.004 --> 00:10:30.755 position:50% align:center
[REIKA]
It's no use.

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:33.049 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
So why am I doing this?

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:36.845 position:50% align:center
In my mind, I know resisting
her won't change the situation.

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:38.304 position:50% align:center
It's hopeless.

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:42.475 position:50% align:center
And yet... my body is
refusing to back down.

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:51.067 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:52.986 position:50% align:center
[REIKA]
Look at you showing off.

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:54.738 position:50% align:center
You just broke your own arm!

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:58.074 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:00.118 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI]
No, no, you're doing it wrong.

00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:03.329 position:50% align:center
All you'll accomplish that way
is destroying your own body.

00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:05.415 position:50% align:center
Mihai, what are you...?

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.250 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI] Inugami's going
to get all pissy with me

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:09.377 position:50% align:center
if you three are finished off.

00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:11.921 position:50% align:center
Let me give you a
little free advice.

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:13.548 position:50% align:center
Pay attention, Kabane.

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:15.216 position:50% align:center
The reason you can't win,

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.260 position:50% align:center
against me or against
that kemono,

00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:19.888 position:50% align:center
is because you're only using
your human strength.

00:11:19.971 --> 00:11:22.057 position:50% align:center
Use your kemono strength.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.309 position:50% align:center
What do you mean,
"kemono strength"?

00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:27.354 position:50% align:center
[REIKA] Are you're really
holding a strategy session?

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:28.730 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI] You have to try
and forget the fact

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:30.190 position:50% align:center
that you're half human.

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:31.816 position:50% align:center
Just follow your instincts.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.651 position:50% align:center
Follow my instincts.

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:36.237 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI] Think about it
in the simplest terms.

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:38.865 position:50% align:center
What's the thing you
want most right now?

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:40.950 position:50% align:center
Beating her is all
I care about.

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:42.160 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI]
Good.

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:44.496 position:50% align:center
Cuz I don't want to
lose Shiki and Akira.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:48.041 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI] That's it.
<i>That</i> is your instinct.

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:48.917 position:50% align:center
Your heart.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.754 position:50% align:center
[KABANE gasps, yells]

00:11:57.842 --> 00:11:59.052 position:50% align:center
[REIKA gasps]

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:07.560 position:50% align:center
[REIKA screams]

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:11.231 position:50% align:center
Wait, no! It can't be!

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.441 position:50% align:center
This... This isn't happening!

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:21.574 position:50% align:center
[KABANE] This is it.
That beastly power I had.

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:27.664 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
But now I can control it.

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:30.709 position:50% align:center
Is it 'cause I have
the lifestone?

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:33.211 position:50% align:center
When Yataro took it from me,
it felt like I was being

00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:36.923 position:50% align:center
swallowed up by something
I didn't understand.

00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:40.176 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI] <i>That</i> is your instinct.
Your heart.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:45.181 position:50% align:center
So I guess... the thing I've
never understood is... my heart?

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:47.142 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI]
Whattya know, you did it.

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:49.227 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Mihai...

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.022 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI] That power is a
kemono's true essence.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.149 position:50% align:center
It should become second-nature.

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:56.901 position:50% align:center
I still don't really get
what it is, though.

00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:01.489 position:50% align:center
Oh, I've gone back to normal.

00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:03.033 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI]
Because the danger's passed.

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:04.534 position:50% align:center
It has?

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.954 position:50% align:center
[KABANE] I should probably pull
off your other legs, to be safe.

00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:08.955 position:50% align:center
[REIKA]
No!

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:10.457 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Kabane!

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.666 position:50% align:center
Hey, you're here.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.586 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Mihai just caught
me up on everything.

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:17.047 position:50% align:center
You've done well,
but enough is enough.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.631 position:50% align:center
Come back now.

00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:20.967 position:50% align:center
Seriously, I grant you freedom,
and this is the thanks I get?

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:21.968 position:50% align:center
Will you shut up?

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:23.595 position:50% align:center
We can't leave, they're alive.

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:25.430 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
That's all right, kiddo.

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:28.308 position:50% align:center
We're only hired to
investigate, remember?

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:30.643 position:50% align:center
Inari will take care
of things from here.

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:35.148 position:50% align:center
Though I'm 100% sure that she is
going to be 100% pissed by this.

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:36.858 position:50% align:center
[NOBIMARU]
You can bet on that.

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:40.862 position:50% align:center
[NOBIMARU] I mean, really,
mere kanonba keeping humans

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:43.698 position:50% align:center
behind a kitsune's back?

00:13:43.782 --> 00:13:46.701 position:50% align:center
Good evening! It's a
pleasure to meet you.

00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:48.536 position:50% align:center
You must be Kabane, right?

00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:51.664 position:50% align:center
[NOBIMARU] Honored to
make your acquaintance.

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:55.502 position:50% align:center
My turn! I'm Nobimaru,
and I work for Lady Inari.

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:57.712 position:50% align:center
I look forward to collaborating.

00:13:57.796 --> 00:13:59.297 position:50% align:center
Who's the kid in the shorts?

00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:00.965 position:50% align:center
Hey, speak of the devil.

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:03.301 position:50% align:center
Do you mind if I have a
take a peep over there?

00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:05.845 position:50% align:center
It's still dangerous,
so keep back.

00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:07.347 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's fine.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.474 position:50% align:center
All right, now.
Please don't move.

00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:13.603 position:50% align:center
No! Stop!

00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:15.355 position:50% align:center
There! All ready to rock.

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:16.898 position:50% align:center
[REIKA]
Leave me alone!

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:21.778 position:50% align:center
[REIKA screams]

00:14:22.654 --> 00:14:24.489 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Just ashes...

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:26.574 position:50% align:center
We can't leave
evidence behind, can we?

00:14:26.658 --> 00:14:29.494 position:50% align:center
I'll get rid of the
other two, as well.

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:31.663 position:50% align:center
And... that's because
humans can't find out

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.373 position:50% align:center
about kemono affairs?

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:34.457 position:50% align:center
[NOBIMARU]
Correct.

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:35.750 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, there are
a lot of humans

00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:37.252 position:50% align:center
involved in this incident,

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:40.046 position:50% align:center
which means covering it up
completely would be difficult.

00:14:41.256 --> 00:14:42.549 position:50% align:center
[NOBIMARU]
We've no choice here.

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:44.926 position:50% align:center
The CEO is going to have
to take responsibility

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:46.428 position:50% align:center
for what occurred.

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:47.721 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
I see.

00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:55.645 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh. You're not,
by any chance,

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:58.106 position:50% align:center
feeling sorry for
them now, are you?

00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:01.568 position:50% align:center
They gave us no choice
but to kill them.

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:05.030 position:50% align:center
But total extermination
does feel harsh.

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:08.950 position:50% align:center
Death's one thing, but acting
like they never... lived?

00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:10.577 position:50% align:center
And, honestly, I don't
know what it's like

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.412 position:50% align:center
to feel sorry for someone,

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:15.290 position:50% align:center
but I don't want them to
be spared, so you do you.

00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:18.043 position:50% align:center
[NOBIMARU laughs]
Glad to hear it.

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:20.545 position:50% align:center
What about the people
working in the factory?

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:23.214 position:50% align:center
Well, as long as they're
still alive, we can help.

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:25.925 position:50% align:center
And we intend to, so you
don't have to worry.

00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:27.761 position:50% align:center
We kitsune are quite civilized.

00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:30.555 position:50% align:center
We're not looking to shrink
humanity's population.

00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:32.182 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Okay, good to know.

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:34.726 position:50% align:center
It'd be best if you go on
ahead and hurry home, now.

00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:37.479 position:50% align:center
I'm worried about
the spiky-haired one.

00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:40.815 position:50% align:center
He's injured and showing
signs of dehydration.

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:42.859 position:50% align:center
He probably overused his powers.

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:45.612 position:50% align:center

Oh, right. Thanks, I will.

[KABANE]
Akira, wake up.

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:51.117 position:50% align:center
Shiki's in trouble.

00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:52.786 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Again?

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:56.122 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:15:56.206 --> 00:15:57.332 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA groans]

00:15:57.415 --> 00:15:59.167 position:50% align:center
[NOBIMARU]
Kabane.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.045 position:50% align:center
May I tell you one last
thing before you go?

00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:09.469 position:50% align:center
Lady Inari hasn't given up
on taking your lifestone.

00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:11.054 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:14.099 position:50% align:center
Think about it. Why else would I
have shown up here so quickly?

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:17.185 position:50% align:center
I'm a snoop.
I've been following you.

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:19.854 position:50% align:center
Upsetting the tanuki
would cause trouble,

00:16:19.938 --> 00:16:23.066 position:50% align:center
so we won't try taking
it by force again.

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:24.609 position:50% align:center
But be on guard.

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:27.070 position:50% align:center
Lady Inari is hoping you
will give her the lifestone

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:28.697 position:50% align:center
of your own volition.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.282 position:50% align:center
That way, the tanuki
can't interfere.

00:16:31.366 --> 00:16:33.159 position:50% align:center
She's a tricky one.

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:36.079 position:50% align:center
If I'm being honest with you,

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:38.373 position:50% align:center
I don't believe any
such thing will occur.

00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:41.209 position:50% align:center
But we are bake-gitsune,
after all.

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:43.545 position:50% align:center
So please be careful, all right?

00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:47.424 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure. I can do that.

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:50.552 position:50% align:center
I'm a little confused why you'd
tell me all that, though.

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:57.851 position:50% align:center
I need you to keep this
absolutely between us.

00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:03.982 position:50% align:center
Truth is. I despise Lady Inari.

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:06.067 position:50% align:center
[KABANE gasps]

00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:10.447 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Um... Understood.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.575 position:50% align:center
I promise I'll keep
it our secret.

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:16.411 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it.

00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:18.580 position:50% align:center
Well, we'll meet
again very soon.

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:21.082 position:50% align:center
Please tell the spiky-haired
boy to take care.

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:30.467 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.719 position:50% align:center
You fibbed when you said
it was an easy mission?

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:33.970 position:50% align:center
How mean!

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:36.222 position:50% align:center
Don't you care that we
could've been killed?

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:37.599 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Keep going.

00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:39.267 position:50% align:center
Slow your roll, snowball.

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:40.935 position:50% align:center
Compliments, I could understand.

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:43.521 position:50% align:center
But I can't accept
being made the bad guy.

00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:44.939 position:50% align:center
Think about it.

00:17:45.023 --> 00:17:46.775 position:50% align:center
You will never
grow under him!

00:17:46.858 --> 00:17:48.610 position:50% align:center
How could you if all he
ever deigns to give you

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:50.403 position:50% align:center
are easy missions? Huh?

00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:51.946 position:50% align:center
You should be thanking
me for the chance

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.406 position:50% align:center
to improve yourselves.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:54.491 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Thank you, Mihai.

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:56.076 position:50% align:center
Woah!

00:17:56.159 --> 00:17:58.078 position:50% align:center
Now that you mention it, I might
have gotten a little stronger.

00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:00.997 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI] Hey, don't let
him off the hook!

00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:02.332 position:50% align:center
Still, though.

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:05.335 position:50% align:center
Ya did a fine job handling
Mihai's recklessness.

00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:06.753 position:50% align:center
Pretty awesome.

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:08.296 position:50% align:center
I guess you guys may
have leveled up

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.215 position:50% align:center
faster than I expected.

00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:12.926 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA giggles]
Hooray! A compliment!

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:15.470 position:50% align:center
Kabane, just go
like this, "Yay"!

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:16.721 position:50% align:center
Yay?

00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:19.224 position:50% align:center
Feel free to toss me
some accolades, as well.

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:20.809 position:50% align:center
Next time you try
something like this,

00:18:20.892 --> 00:18:23.812 position:50% align:center
I'll have you shipped back
to Romania packed in ice.

00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:25.105 position:50% align:center
Inugami1

00:18:25.188 --> 00:18:27.565 position:50% align:center
Once Shiki wakes up,
give him lotsa praise too!

00:18:27.649 --> 00:18:30.318 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI] Yeah! I'll even
order him a pizza.

00:18:30.402 --> 00:18:31.945 position:50% align:center
Now, clean up and get to bed.

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:33.279 position:50% align:center
G'night!

00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:37.200 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI] That certainly wasn't
a bad way to pass the time.

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:39.411 position:50% align:center
Sure, if you think almost
getting a few kids killed

00:18:39.494 --> 00:18:41.204 position:50% align:center
is a fun night.

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:42.664 position:50% align:center
If you're so
displeased with me,

00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:44.958 position:50% align:center
you can kill me
whenever you'd like to.

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:48.336 position:50% align:center
A man such as you must know
how to eliminate a vampire.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.716 position:50% align:center
However, if you're
allowing me to walk free,

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:56.177 position:50% align:center
then consider this is a lesson
in keeping me well entertained.

00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:59.180 position:50% align:center
Truthfully, I've taken a
liking to those children.

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:02.892 position:50% align:center
Perhaps I can bestow my
wisdom upon them again soon.

[AKIRA, SHIKI snore]

00:19:05.395 --> 00:19:07.188 position:50% align:center
I can't fall asleep.

They're alive.

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:33.673 position:50% align:center
I'm glad.

[REPORTER] And in other news,
allegations of overtime

00:19:38.553 --> 00:19:41.181 position:50% align:center
violations are creating
quite a stir. It involves...

[AKIRA gasps] Oh my gosh,
that's where we were!

Gah! Buzz off, already!

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:52.567 position:50% align:center

weird since our last mission.

He hovers and sticks to me
like glue wherever I go!

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:04.204 position:50% align:center

it took ya so long to wake up.

He's just worried about you.

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:07.123 position:50% align:center
Can't you cut him some slack?

00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:09.334 position:50% align:center
This is how he worries
about someone?

00:20:09.417 --> 00:20:11.044 position:50% align:center
Is he a grandma?

I've been waiting for you!

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:48.707 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I figured as much.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.792 position:50% align:center
You said you were just
gonna pick up dinner.

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:52.752 position:50% align:center
I thought you'd be
back a lot sooner.

[KABANE] A-A-Actually.
A job came in after that,

00:21:01.011 --> 00:21:02.846 position:50% align:center
so I went on a mission.

00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:05.849 position:50% align:center
A mission? Well, you couldn't
help it, in that case.

00:21:05.932 --> 00:21:09.352 position:50% align:center

I've never been
on one like that.

00:21:14.941 --> 00:21:17.277 position:50% align:center

Um.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.744 position:50% align:center
The truth is... lots of
stuff kept coming up

00:21:25.827 --> 00:21:28.121 position:50% align:center
and I forgot about you.

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:29.456 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:34.127 position:50% align:center
Oh... Okay.

What are these? Koi fish?

00:21:40.258 --> 00:21:41.926 position:50% align:center
I caught 'em myself.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:45.889 position:50% align:center
I thought maybe we could
eat 'em together...

00:21:45.972 --> 00:21:47.140 position:50% align:center

[NOBIMARU] Think about
what I told you, Kabane.

Be careful. You are dealing
