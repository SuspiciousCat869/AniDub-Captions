I just... like the office
better with you there.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.875
I want you to come back,

00:10:52.959 --> 00:10:55.959
and I think Shiki probably
feels the same way.

00:10:58.375 --> 00:11:00.625
[AKIRA] You never change,
do you, Kabane?

00:11:00.709 --> 00:11:02.083
What do you mean?

00:11:02.166 --> 00:11:04.458
[AKIRA] You don't even
know who I am, do you?

00:11:04.542 --> 00:11:05.875
Man, are you slow.

00:11:05.959 --> 00:11:07.458
[gasps]

00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:09.625
[AKIRA] I'm the one who asked
Yui to deal with you guys, okay?

00:11:09.709 --> 00:11:10.834
It was me.

00:11:10.917 --> 00:11:12.083
[NII-SAN]
Akira...

00:11:12.166 --> 00:11:15.041
[AKIRA] And I don't need
this plushie anymore!

00:11:15.125 --> 00:11:17.375
I don't remember asking
you to come get me.

00:11:17.458 --> 00:11:18.667
Why would I want to go with you

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.166
when I could finally live
a quiet life with Yui?

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:22.500
Mind your business.

00:11:22.583 --> 00:11:24.959
I don't get it.
Why are you lying?

00:11:25.041 --> 00:11:27.458
You would never
say stuff like that.

00:11:27.542 --> 00:11:30.250
Is there some reason your
not being honest with me?

00:11:30.333 --> 00:11:32.041
[AKIRA]
I am being honest.

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:34.959
In fact, it's how I've always
felt about you people.

00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:36.333
[KABANE]
That's not true.

00:11:36.417 --> 00:11:37.667
[AKIRA]
Let me make it clear.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.000
[KABANE]
Akira!

00:11:39.083 --> 00:11:40.458
I hate you!

00:11:41.875 --> 00:11:43.542
[AKIRA]
Aw, what's with that face?

00:11:43.625 --> 00:11:45.333
Did you think I was
in here crying?

00:11:45.417 --> 00:11:47.625
[KABANE gasps]

00:11:47.709 --> 00:11:50.750
Does it look like
I'm lying to you?

00:11:50.834 --> 00:11:54.333
Uh, it doesn't. Not really.

00:11:59.375 --> 00:12:01.041
Oh, you're back!

00:12:01.125 --> 00:12:02.166
[gasps]

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.000
No! Stop it!

00:12:04.083 --> 00:12:06.500
Get away from him.
You can no longer tell

00:12:06.583 --> 00:12:08.625
the difference between what's
pure and what's filthy.

00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:10.208
[AKIRA]
That's ridiculous.

00:12:10.291 --> 00:12:12.875
Do you honestly believe I
care what happens to them?

00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:13.875
[KABANE gasps]

00:12:13.959 --> 00:12:15.542
[AKIRA]
Forget about these people.

00:12:15.625 --> 00:12:17.333
I'm already tired
of this castle.

00:12:17.417 --> 00:12:19.166
I wanna move! Right now!

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:22.667
Okay. We can
prioritize that, then.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.667
[AKIRA] This time, let's get a
place with a view of the ocean!

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.709
Oh, I don't need
that salt anymore.

00:12:27.792 --> 00:12:29.208
You can just leave it here.

00:12:31.458 --> 00:12:32.625
[KABANE]
Akira!

00:12:34.834 --> 00:12:37.250
[AKIRA whimpers]

00:12:37.333 --> 00:12:40.625
[AKIRA] Thank goodness
I'm a yuki-onoko.

00:12:40.709 --> 00:12:43.250
Tears are made
of water, after all.

00:12:47.583 --> 00:12:49.041
Bye-bye, Kabane.

00:12:49.125 --> 00:12:51.959
--[door closes]
--[KABANE gasps]

00:12:56.959 --> 00:12:59.583
[YUI]
Hm? Something wrong, Akira?

00:12:59.667 --> 00:13:01.917
Uh, no. I'm okay.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.083
My mind was just elsewhere.

00:13:05.166 --> 00:13:07.166
You need to stay close to me.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:08.583
It's dangerous.

00:13:08.667 --> 00:13:10.500
You got it!

00:13:10.583 --> 00:13:12.750
[AKIRA]
I hope everything's okay.

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:15.917
The rest is up to you, Nii- <i>san</i> .

00:13:18.625 --> 00:13:20.542
--[NII-SAN] Pardon, sir.
--[KABANE gasps]

00:13:20.625 --> 00:13:23.458
[NII-SAN]
Hello? I need a favor.

00:13:23.542 --> 00:13:27.625
Would you mind finishing
Akira's uncompleted tasks?

00:13:27.709 --> 00:13:28.875
[KABANE grunts]

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.917
[NII-SAN] Next, stuff me
someplace where I can be

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.542
held tightly and securely.

00:13:34.625 --> 00:13:35.458
[KABANE]
Kay.

00:13:35.542 --> 00:13:37.208
[NII-SAN] Squeeze.

00:13:37.291 --> 00:13:40.000
My overall make-up is
four percent mechanical,

00:13:40.083 --> 00:13:42.542
so I can contribute a
small degree of heat.

00:13:42.625 --> 00:13:44.750
Makes sense. Pretty helpful.

00:13:47.375 --> 00:13:48.542
[inaudible]

00:13:49.583 --> 00:13:51.083
[INARI]
My, my...

00:13:51.166 --> 00:13:53.667
Poor baby, you seem so down.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.875
What's wrong?

00:13:55.959 --> 00:13:57.250
[KABANE]
Inari?

00:13:57.333 --> 00:13:58.917
Long time no see!

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.709
When'd you get here?

00:14:00.792 --> 00:14:03.458
[INARI]
Aw, are you wary of me?

00:14:03.542 --> 00:14:07.291
I'm not after your
lifestone this time.

00:14:07.375 --> 00:14:09.667
I've come to retrieve
the nullstone

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.959
and you're gonna help me.

00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:13.625
[gasps]

00:14:13.709 --> 00:14:16.291
[KABANE]
No. I'm sorry. I--

00:14:16.375 --> 00:14:19.375
This isn't about Akira's
family problems.

00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:23.208
Honestly, the reason I'm
suggesting it is for your sake.

00:14:23.291 --> 00:14:26.125
After all, the nullstone happens
to be more than a little

00:14:26.208 --> 00:14:28.166
connected to your parents.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.458
Piques your interest, huh?

00:14:39.291 --> 00:14:41.458
[AKIRA] It's been a long
time since the two of us

00:14:41.542 --> 00:14:43.834
have taken a stroll
together like this.

00:14:43.917 --> 00:14:44.875
[YUI]
Mmm.

00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:46.208
[AKIRA]
Hey, guess what?

00:14:46.291 --> 00:14:48.250
They haven't been getting
as mad at me lately

00:14:48.333 --> 00:14:50.083
when I leave the snowstorm.

00:14:50.166 --> 00:14:53.208
But without you around,
it's kinda scary.

00:14:53.291 --> 00:14:54.458
[YUI]
Yeah?

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.500
[AKIRA]
Can I ask you a question?

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.959
[AKIRA] Are the chief's
duties really hard?

00:15:04.417 --> 00:15:05.583
[YUI]
Why?

00:15:05.667 --> 00:15:09.125
Because! You always look
so gloomy these days!

00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:10.500
I wanna help you!

00:15:10.583 --> 00:15:12.166
Let me do something!

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.667
I can't stand
watching you struggle!

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.709
I mean, we're twins!

00:15:18.875 --> 00:15:20.291
[YUI] But even twins
have different things

00:15:20.375 --> 00:15:22.125
they're good at.

00:15:22.208 --> 00:15:25.000
I am strong, and you
never have been.

00:15:25.083 --> 00:15:26.667
So let me do this.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.166
I can handle the tough,
painful stuff.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.834
--You don't have to do anything.
--But I--

00:15:31.917 --> 00:15:35.041
[YUI] Besides, you have
your own specialty, right?

00:15:35.125 --> 00:15:38.542
Huh? What is it?
I'm not sure I d--

00:15:38.625 --> 00:15:42.500
Smiling, of course.
And it's beautiful.

00:15:42.583 --> 00:15:44.709
Because you're so pure of heart.

00:15:44.792 --> 00:15:47.125
You're my salvation.

00:15:47.208 --> 00:15:49.041
I'll always keep you safe.

00:15:49.125 --> 00:15:50.583
I don't want you
to become tainted.

00:15:50.667 --> 00:15:52.291
[whimpers]

00:15:52.375 --> 00:15:53.709
[YUI]
What's wrong?

00:15:53.792 --> 00:15:56.917
I'm sorry.
I already am, I'm filthy!

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.333
[YUI]
What?

00:15:58.417 --> 00:16:02.041
[AKIRA] It's yucky but
this morning... I wet the bed!

00:16:02.125 --> 00:16:04.959
I got rid of the evidence,
so the women didn't find out.

00:16:05.041 --> 00:16:07.458
But I'm 14, it's embarrassing!

00:16:07.542 --> 00:16:09.291
Oh, is that all?

00:16:09.375 --> 00:16:11.667
You really are a
pure one, aren't you?

00:16:13.333 --> 00:16:14.625
You good?

00:16:14.709 --> 00:16:19.208
[YUI] Akira. Listen to me,
are you sure it was pee?

00:16:20.291 --> 00:16:23.375
[YUI] Akira had become eligible
to serve as chief too.

00:16:23.458 --> 00:16:26.166
If the women found out,
I knew what would happen next.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:28.333
They'd fight tooth and
nail to get to him,

00:16:28.417 --> 00:16:30.291
looking to climb
the social ladder.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.959
[YUI]
Assemble all the women at once!

00:16:34.041 --> 00:16:36.417
Make sure Akira doesn't see you!

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.333
[YUI]
There were over 200 women.

00:16:38.417 --> 00:16:42.417
If even one became aware of the
change in Akira, it was over.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.667
[HISAME] Yui, why have you
gathered all of us like this?

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.792
[YUI] That first night, when I
lied to Akira about my duties.

00:16:50.875 --> 00:16:53.041
That was the moment we
split from being twins,

00:16:53.125 --> 00:16:55.500
to being individuals.

00:16:55.583 --> 00:16:57.500
If the truth I just
learned came out,

00:16:57.583 --> 00:17:00.041
and Akira became tainted,
like me,

00:17:00.125 --> 00:17:03.375
maybe we could become one again.

00:17:03.458 --> 00:17:07.542
After all, together we could
handle what one of us could not.

00:17:08.625 --> 00:17:11.166
[YUI]
But... I....

00:17:12.917 --> 00:17:15.959
[YUI] I will do everything in my
power to completely satisfy

00:17:16.041 --> 00:17:18.583
every last one of you. I swear!

00:17:18.667 --> 00:17:20.000
On one condition.

00:17:20.083 --> 00:17:21.959
You'll let Akira
leave the village!

00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:24.625
If you say no,
then I'll kill myself!

00:17:24.709 --> 00:17:26.291
[YUKI-ONNA gasp]

00:17:26.375 --> 00:17:30.875
[HISAME] Ha! Utterly ridiculous.
Go ahead and off yourself.

00:17:30.959 --> 00:17:34.875
Once you're gone, Akira will be
crowned chief in your stead.

00:17:34.959 --> 00:17:36.959
[YUI]
You're the one being ridiculous.

00:17:37.041 --> 00:17:38.458
[HISAME]
Oh?

00:17:38.542 --> 00:17:41.208
[YUI] Do you truly believe
Akira is fit for such a task?

00:17:41.291 --> 00:17:43.041
How naïve.

00:17:43.125 --> 00:17:44.625
Go ahead and test me.

00:17:44.709 --> 00:17:47.125
The fate of the village'll
be on you, though.

00:17:47.208 --> 00:17:50.458
[YUKI-ONNA B] He's correct.
Akira lacks Yui's vitality.

00:17:50.542 --> 00:17:53.458
He wouldn't last until the
next yuki-onoko is born.

00:17:53.542 --> 00:17:57.083
Without Yui, our entire
village would perish.

00:17:58.333 --> 00:17:59.875
[HISAME]
Very well.

00:17:59.959 --> 00:18:02.000
In consideration
of your resolve,

00:18:02.083 --> 00:18:04.750
we shall disregard
Akira's departure.

00:18:05.792 --> 00:18:07.333
[YUI]
Listen carefully.

00:18:07.417 --> 00:18:10.208
Tokyo. Kemonoist. Inugami.

00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:13.583
Remember those words,
and just keep heading south.

00:18:13.667 --> 00:18:15.834
I'll be there right behind you.

00:18:15.917 --> 00:18:17.750
We'll meet in Tokyo.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.542
[YUI] That should've
been the end of it.

00:18:22.625 --> 00:18:25.083
Or at least I thought.

00:18:25.166 --> 00:18:26.834
[YUKI-ONNA B]
I feel sorry for Yui.

00:18:26.917 --> 00:18:28.834
[YUKI-ONNA C]
He believes us, though, right?

00:18:28.917 --> 00:18:30.250
[YUKI-ONNA B]
Somehow.

00:18:30.333 --> 00:18:33.333
Allowing a yuki-onoko to leave
was out of the question.

00:18:33.417 --> 00:18:35.583
Obviously, we sent
someone after him.

00:18:35.667 --> 00:18:36.959
[YUKI-ONNA C]
It's been a year.

00:18:37.041 --> 00:18:39.000
Akira is either a
weather-beaten corpse,

00:18:39.083 --> 00:18:42.458
or been consigned to
the earth as boar fodder.

[YUI gasps]
Hisame!

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:47.917
Damn you! How dare you
do something like--

00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:50.291
[HISAME]
Hold him still,

00:18:50.375 --> 00:18:52.250
and make sure he can't
bite his tongue.

00:18:52.333 --> 00:18:53.125
[YUKI-ONNA B]
Yes Ma'am!

00:18:53.208 --> 00:18:54.834
[HISAME]
As for Akira.

00:18:54.917 --> 00:18:57.417
I said we would
disregard his departure.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.375
I never guaranteed
him a safe passage.

00:19:00.458 --> 00:19:02.458

[HISAME]
Don't let him escape! Get him!

00:19:05.208 --> 00:19:06.583
[YUKI-ONNA C]
Hold it!

00:19:06.667 --> 00:19:09.792
[YUI] It was a small world,
shut in by the snowstorm.

00:19:09.875 --> 00:19:13.500
Merely repeating the
cycle of birth and death.

00:19:13.583 --> 00:19:16.333
[YUI] Nothing could bloom
from the frozen earth.

00:19:16.417 --> 00:19:18.834
A place without change.

00:19:18.917 --> 00:19:21.542
This village was dead.

00:19:26.208 --> 00:19:28.000
What's the matter? You good?

00:19:28.083 --> 00:19:29.333
Something's coming.

00:19:29.417 --> 00:19:30.583
[AKIRA gasps]

00:19:33.875 --> 00:19:36.166
Wh-What is this? A cage?

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.583
[NOBIMARU]
Wow, how dramatic.

00:19:38.667 --> 00:19:40.583
I came here to get Akira,

00:19:40.667 --> 00:19:42.500
but I can't take him
hostage if he's in there.

00:19:42.583 --> 00:19:43.834
It's Nobimaru!

00:19:43.917 --> 00:19:46.709
What do you want from us?
Who are you to Akira?

00:19:46.792 --> 00:19:47.834
[NOBIMARU]
A stranger.

00:19:47.917 --> 00:19:50.291
[AKIRA]
Wait--no, I guess that's true.

00:19:50.375 --> 00:19:51.625
[YUI]
I see.

00:19:51.709 --> 00:19:54.041
Well, then. You should leave!

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.625
[NOBIMARU]
He's so fast!

00:19:56.709 --> 00:19:59.208
If he'd hit me directly,
I'd be done for.

00:19:59.291 --> 00:20:00.542
Flames, huh?

00:20:00.625 --> 00:20:01.917
[NOBIMARU]
Yes!

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.417
I'm not sure if they'll work
against the nullstone,

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.041
so we'll have to see.

00:20:05.125 --> 00:20:06.375
But tonight...

00:20:06.458 --> 00:20:08.041
...I'll be going all out.

00:20:08.125 --> 00:20:09.875
The boss is here, after all.

00:20:12.458 --> 00:20:14.500
[INARI] The best description
of the nullstone is that

00:20:14.583 --> 00:20:16.542
it's like the
lifestone's sibling.

00:20:16.625 --> 00:20:19.917
If get my hands on it, then
someone might get to learn

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.166
a bit more about his
mommy and daddy.

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:24.667
You're serious, right?

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.083
Oh my, you don't trust me?

00:20:27.166 --> 00:20:29.959
[KABANE] No. Tricking me
would be one thing,

00:20:30.041 --> 00:20:33.000
but I'm not about to leave
Inugami and Shiki here alone.

00:20:35.583 --> 00:20:38.667
[INUGAMI]
We're fine, Kabane. Go ahead.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.083
[KABANE] Was that you
talking just now, Nii- <i>San</i> ?

00:20:41.166 --> 00:20:42.291
[NII-SAN]
Correct.

00:20:42.375 --> 00:20:44.667
I'm delivering a message
to you from Inugami.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.875
It's based on his
heartbeat and brainwaves.

00:20:46.959 --> 00:20:48.458
[INUGAMI]
Listen, Kabane.

00:20:48.542 --> 00:20:51.166
Inari isn't gonna make
a move against us.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.959
Or should I say, not this
second, she won't.

00:20:54.041 --> 00:20:55.500
[INARI chuckles]

00:20:55.583 --> 00:20:57.959
[INUGAMI] It'll take a little
longer for the ice to melt.

00:20:58.041 --> 00:21:00.125
I'm counting on you
to save Akira.

00:21:00.208 --> 00:21:03.291
Alright, understood.
I'll be back!

00:21:06.667 --> 00:21:09.500
Wow, you seem awfully confident.

00:21:09.583 --> 00:21:10.917
So you transformed the ice

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.125
instead of
transforming yourself.

00:21:13.208 --> 00:21:16.667
One layer of thermal insulation,
and another layer of air.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.750
It's basically a thermos, huh?

00:21:18.834 --> 00:21:19.917
[INUGAMI]
Perceptive.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.125
Could it be any
less efficient, though?

00:21:23.208 --> 00:21:25.417
You've grown weaker, Inugami.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.625
You've put way too much energy
into those useless brats.

00:21:28.709 --> 00:21:30.792
[INUGAMI] Yeah, well,
it's not like strength

00:21:30.875 --> 00:21:34.250
is my top priority.
Unlike some people.

00:21:34.333 --> 00:21:35.917
[INARI]
Very funny.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.208
Let me show you how to
actually use children.

00:21:40.291 --> 00:21:42.291
[NOBIMARU] I'd like to avoid
any direct hits from the ice,

00:21:42.375 --> 00:21:43.750
at least.

00:21:43.834 --> 00:21:45.375

They got skewered!

00:21:59.125 --> 00:22:01.250
[NOBIMARU]
An unavoidable sacrifice.

like, you won't escape my ice!
