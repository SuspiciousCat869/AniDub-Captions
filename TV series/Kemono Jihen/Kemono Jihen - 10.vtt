Nii- <i>san</i> 's the
name of his plushie.

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:21.493 position:50% align:center
It reminds him of his bro,

some kinda pet name.

00:03:24.997 --> 00:03:26.498 position:50% align:center
My twin brother.

00:03:26.582 --> 00:03:28.834 position:50% align:center
You see, when I

I was hoping to find him.

[INUGAMI] Why don't we
have Mihai fix it for him?

The guy hates having
nothing to do.

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:41.805 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI] You kids were
pretty presumptuous,

[NII-SAN] Hiya! Would you please
consider giving me a name?

[MIHAI] While I was at it,
I installed an AI.

we were both considered a

And that wouldn't happen to us.

00:06:09.745 --> 00:06:11.538 position:50% align:center
Because we were twins.

mixed up in the sand.

ideal place for you.

00:08:30.511 --> 00:08:33.347 position:50% align:center
That's great! I'm so
glad you're with me.

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.517 position:50% align:center
Can you help me look for
my brother, too? Please?

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.809 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:42.231 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:43.649 --> 00:08:46.944 position:50% align:center
Yui, is that you?

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:50.531 position:50% align:center
Akira... I finally found you.

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:04.711 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
So... what is it?

00:09:04.795 --> 00:09:07.047 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.508 position:50% align:center
Stuff dropped by humans,
I guess.

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.594 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:09:14.096 --> 00:09:16.890 position:50% align:center
[YUI] Tokyo is supposedly
a city far to the south,

00:09:16.974 --> 00:09:20.477 position:50% align:center
where all sorts of species of
kemono and humans live.

00:09:20.561 --> 00:09:22.980 position:50% align:center
It's always bright there,
even at night.

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:24.606 position:50% align:center
I want to go to Tokyo!

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.733 position:50% align:center
Why don't we get up
early tomorrow and go?

00:09:26.817 --> 00:09:30.279 position:50% align:center
You're so silly. Walking there
would take us several weeks.

00:09:30.362 --> 00:09:33.240 position:50% align:center
It'd be crazy to try it
while we're still kids.

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:35.242 position:50% align:center
No fair.

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:37.452 position:50% align:center
I heard some of
the women talking.

00:09:37.536 --> 00:09:40.122 position:50% align:center
There's this guy.
His name's Inugami.

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:42.541 position:50% align:center
He has a kemonoist office there.

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:45.669 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA] Wow. Do you think
he'd be nice to us?

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:48.589 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
Yeah, I'm not really sure.

00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:49.923 position:50% align:center
Though honestly,

00:09:50.007 --> 00:09:52.843 position:50% align:center
anything'd be better than
staying here forever.

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:55.179 position:50% align:center
But one day we'll go to Tokyo.

00:09:55.262 --> 00:09:58.390 position:50% align:center
And the two of us'll live
a quiet, happy life together.

00:09:59.725 --> 00:10:01.476 position:50% align:center
I'm so lucky!

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.897 position:50% align:center
Running into my big brother when
I've been forced to the streets.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.398 position:50% align:center
Like, perfect timing!

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:09.651 position:50% align:center
I wasn't sure where I was
gonna go, it was scary!

00:10:09.735 --> 00:10:13.447 position:50% align:center
I thought you were living over
at that Inugami man's place.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.158 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Yeah, but I ran away.

00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:18.785 position:50% align:center
I'm kind of a
good-for-nothing there.

00:10:18.869 --> 00:10:20.287 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.706 position:50% align:center
nyway, what have you
been doing all this time?

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:25.667 position:50% align:center
I mean, since we
left the village?

00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:28.879 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
Tokyo. Kemonoist. Inugami.

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:32.049 position:50% align:center
Remember those words,
and just keep heading south.

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:33.759 position:50% align:center
I'll be there
right behind you.

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:36.053 position:50% align:center
We'll meet in Tokyo.

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center
I thought we'd bump into each
other a little sooner than this.

00:10:39.056 --> 00:10:41.934 position:50% align:center
Tokyo's a big place,
though, huh?

00:10:42.017 --> 00:10:44.728 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Oh! Hold on just a minute!

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:46.063 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA giggles]

00:10:47.606 --> 00:10:49.691 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Here!

00:10:49.775 --> 00:10:51.318 position:50% align:center
I don't know what this is.

00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:52.819 position:50% align:center
A yummy crepe!

00:10:52.903 --> 00:10:55.239 position:50% align:center
We saw them in that magazine
we found by the village!

00:10:55.322 --> 00:10:57.324 position:50% align:center
Remember we said we'd
get them one day?

00:10:57.407 --> 00:11:00.160 position:50% align:center
Well, I didn't have enough money
on me to buy two of 'em,

00:11:00.244 --> 00:11:01.745 position:50% align:center
so we'll share!

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:03.539 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
That's okay. You have it.

00:11:03.622 --> 00:11:06.542 position:50% align:center
Wait! I thought you
liked sweet stuff, Yui?

00:11:06.625 --> 00:11:08.836 position:50% align:center
Believe me, I've eaten
plenty of these babies.

00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:11.797 position:50% align:center
They're so freakin' delicious!
Like, I'm kind of obsessed!

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.048 position:50% align:center
So, I just--

00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:16.510 position:50% align:center
All the more reason for
you to eat it. I'm fine.

00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:20.138 position:50% align:center
We need to find a place to live.
Hurry and finish that.

00:11:20.222 --> 00:11:21.473 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.352 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI] Wait. So you're
already finished?

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:26.812 position:50% align:center
That was fast.

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:28.313 position:50% align:center
It's just like I said.

00:11:28.397 --> 00:11:31.191 position:50% align:center
Stuff's a lot easier to do
without Akira in the way.

00:11:31.275 --> 00:11:34.111 position:50% align:center
Got any more loose
ends for us to tie up?

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:36.280 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Nope, that's it. You're done.

00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:38.323 position:50% align:center
Go crazy, it's you time.

00:11:38.407 --> 00:11:39.950 position:50% align:center
'Ight, sick.

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:41.243 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Kabane.

00:11:44.538 --> 00:11:47.833 position:50% align:center
Tell me, do you agree that
Akira isn't good for anything?

00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:51.962 position:50% align:center
Yeah. But I don't believe
that's really a problem.

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:53.505 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:11:53.589 --> 00:11:56.508 position:50% align:center
All right. I'll let
this play out.

00:11:56.592 --> 00:11:59.595 position:50% align:center
Life is full of stuff you
gotta figure out yourself.

00:11:59.678 --> 00:12:01.305 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:03.140 position:50% align:center
[beeping]

00:12:04.808 --> 00:12:07.060 position:50% align:center
Ugh, I'm tired of this game.

00:12:07.144 --> 00:12:10.063 position:50% align:center
But going out to do
stuff costs money.

00:12:10.147 --> 00:12:12.357 position:50% align:center
Kabane, let's do something fun.

00:12:12.441 --> 00:12:13.734 position:50% align:center
Something like what?

00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:14.902 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with you?

00:12:14.985 --> 00:12:16.987 position:50% align:center
Something like anything,
I don't care!

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.073 position:50% align:center
Not sure I get it, but I
bet Akira could come up

00:12:20.157 --> 00:12:21.950 position:50% align:center
with a good idea
if we asked him.

00:12:22.034 --> 00:12:23.160 position:50% align:center
Why don't we call him?

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:24.995 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI] Ha! Do I sound
like I'm in the mood

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:26.538 position:50% align:center
to chat on the phone?

00:12:26.622 --> 00:12:29.750 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Your emotional sensors
really are busted, aren't they?

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:32.252 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
My what? You lost me again.

00:12:32.336 --> 00:12:35.088 position:50% align:center
Oh, never mind,
too much trouble.

00:12:35.172 --> 00:12:36.548 position:50% align:center
Yeesh.

00:12:38.467 --> 00:12:42.095 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
Ugh. I'm so bored.

00:12:42.179 --> 00:12:44.139 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
How far are we going?

00:12:44.223 --> 00:12:46.517 position:50% align:center
There's nothing but
woods down that way.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.769 position:50% align:center
We gotta find somewhere
out of sight.

00:12:48.852 --> 00:12:50.145 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:12:50.229 --> 00:12:52.231 position:50% align:center
When you said you were
looking for a place to stay,

00:12:52.314 --> 00:12:53.482 position:50% align:center
you meant here?

00:12:53.565 --> 00:12:56.026 position:50% align:center
What kind of home do you
see yourself living in?

00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:58.153 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Hm. Let's see.

00:12:58.237 --> 00:13:00.572 position:50% align:center
A designer condo would
be hard to pass up,

00:13:00.656 --> 00:13:04.159 position:50% align:center
but the ice castle I saw in that
one movie was really nice, too.

00:13:04.243 --> 00:13:06.411 position:50% align:center
I could imagine myself there!

00:13:06.495 --> 00:13:08.830 position:50% align:center
I betcha we yuki-onoko
could build one someplace

00:13:08.914 --> 00:13:11.500 position:50% align:center
if we had enough water around.

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:13.377 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
A castle, huh?

00:13:15.838 --> 00:13:17.047 position:50% align:center

[AKIRA]
No way!

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:32.813 position:50% align:center
It's not exactly what
I envisioned, but...

00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:35.190 position:50% align:center
...still super awesome!

00:13:35.274 --> 00:13:36.233 position:50% align:center

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:37.818 position:50% align:center

Whoa!

00:13:38.819 --> 00:13:40.946 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA giggles]

00:13:42.239 --> 00:13:46.618 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh! I feel kinda
like a prince right now!

00:13:46.702 --> 00:13:48.871 position:50% align:center
Or, maybe I should
say a daimyo!

00:13:48.954 --> 00:13:51.748 position:50% align:center
Oh man! I am majorly hyped!

00:13:51.832 --> 00:13:53.792 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA] Oh, hey! You know
what'd complete this?

00:13:53.876 --> 00:13:55.169 position:50% align:center
A canopy bed.

00:13:55.252 --> 00:13:58.172 position:50% align:center
Also a clawfoot bathtub, oh,
and cute chandelier too!

00:13:58.255 --> 00:14:00.048 position:50% align:center
Can I have them please?

00:14:00.132 --> 00:14:01.091 position:50% align:center
That's fine.

00:14:01.175 --> 00:14:03.594 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Woo-hoo! I love you so much!

00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:08.932 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA] What should I
snap first. This is a gold mine!

00:14:09.016 --> 00:14:12.686 position:50% align:center
There's nothing here that
isn't post-worthy! Tough call!

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.607 position:50% align:center

You won't be needing this.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.526 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA gasps]
How could you do that?!

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:20.944 position:50% align:center
What the heck?

00:14:21.028 --> 00:14:23.822 position:50% align:center
I really might die if I can't
update my social media!

00:14:23.906 --> 00:14:26.825 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:26.909 --> 00:14:29.077 position:50% align:center
Uh, you okay?

00:14:29.161 --> 00:14:33.165 position:50% align:center
[YUI] You said a bed,
a bath, and a light, yeah?

00:14:33.248 --> 00:14:35.792 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna stock up
on food, first.

00:14:35.876 --> 00:14:37.544 position:50% align:center
Don't leave while I'm gone.

[AKIRA gasps]

00:14:41.632 --> 00:14:44.801 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA] Wait, what is this?
Why is this door locked?

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.931 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Seriously! Come on, open!

00:14:49.014 --> 00:14:51.308 position:50% align:center
Man, this is the worst!

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:53.227 position:50% align:center
What's the point of
being in a fancy castle

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:56.480 position:50% align:center
if I can't use my smartphone?

00:14:56.563 --> 00:14:59.358 position:50% align:center
Hold on. If I'm locked up...

00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:01.902 position:50% align:center
...am I, like, a prisoner?

00:15:04.238 --> 00:15:05.739 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:15:07.658 --> 00:15:09.368 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
That's strange.

00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:12.120 position:50% align:center
Is this what beef stew is
supposed to look like?

00:15:12.204 --> 00:15:14.748 position:50% align:center
Shoulda stuck with our
usual cup o' ramen.

00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:17.584 position:50% align:center
Whose idea was it to try
boredom-cooking, anyway?

00:15:17.668 --> 00:15:19.253 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Pretty sure it was you.

[SHIKI grunts]

00:15:24.216 --> 00:15:26.552 position:50% align:center
[KABANE] It's burnt
outside and raw inside.

00:15:26.635 --> 00:15:28.887 position:50% align:center
Maybe cuz we had the
heat up too high?

00:15:28.971 --> 00:15:31.390 position:50% align:center
Also, why did we decide to try
and make something like

00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:33.475 position:50% align:center
demi-glace sauce from scratch?

00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:36.270 position:50% align:center
We should've gone to the store
and bought the canned stuff.

00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:38.730 position:50% align:center
So, what? Everything's my fault?

00:15:38.814 --> 00:15:40.357 position:50% align:center
No, I wouldn't say that.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.900 position:50% align:center
It's partly my fault too

00:15:41.984 --> 00:15:43.735 position:50% align:center
because I didn't
speak up about it.

00:15:43.819 --> 00:15:46.697 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI] In other words,
it's just mostly my fault.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.615 position:50% align:center
Okay, fine, whatever, my bad.

00:15:48.699 --> 00:15:50.659 position:50% align:center
Guess I'll have to
eat it all, then.

00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:52.494 position:50% align:center
