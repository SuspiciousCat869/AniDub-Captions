[KABANE]
Wait a sec...

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:25.650 position:50% align:center
Remember.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.862 position:50% align:center
Don't ever open the door at the
far end of the hallway, yeah?

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:30.572 position:50% align:center
Not ever.

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:32.866 position:50% align:center
[KABANE] I wonder if it's
all right to move the boxes

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.076 position:50% align:center
here, though, to clean.

Kabane's not around?

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:17.804 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA] Nope. We haven't
seen him since this morning.

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:20.390 position:50% align:center
He was in the middle of
cleaning and then we found

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.434 position:50% align:center
this mop chillin' on the floor.

00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:25.103 position:50% align:center
He's not the type to just
leave crap lying around.

00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:28.523 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Wait, where did
you find that again?

[INUGAMI] Don't take advantage
of Kabane's good nature.

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:04.476 position:50% align:center
Huh. Now that you mention it,
I'd never asked this boy's name.

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.145 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you hadn't
told me you'd hired him.

00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:09.022 position:50% align:center
I do love obedience.

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:12.025 position:50% align:center
Submission is good
in a sla--a child.

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:14.569 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI] Yeah, you were
about to say "slave".

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:17.947 position:50% align:center
Nonsense. Must you
always assume the worst?

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.282 position:50% align:center
Hang on.

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:22.619 position:50% align:center
Mister, have you been in
this room this whole time?

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.579 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI]
Indeed, I have.

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:27.082 position:50% align:center
I am Mihai the vampire.

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:30.126 position:50% align:center
And I provide ICT for the
Inugami Strangeness

Counseling Office.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.129 position:50% align:center
Ahem. Kabane.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.547 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:36.383 position:50% align:center
As of this moment,
I am appointing you

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.343 position:50% align:center
to be my official waitperson.

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:41.012 position:50% align:center
Your job will be to remain
at my side at all times

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:44.557 position:50% align:center
to open and close my
water bottles as needed.

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:46.184 position:50% align:center
I know you're honored.

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:47.727 position:50% align:center
Sure, I can do that.

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:49.729 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty good
at serving people.

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:52.774 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI] Would you all please
step out for a moment?

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:54.776 position:50% align:center
And that's why the
door's off limits!

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.195 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
Dude's bad news!

00:03:57.278 --> 00:03:59.656 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI] Mihai's an old
acquaintance of mine.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.159 position:50% align:center
Vampires possess superhuman
levels of strength and knowledge

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.828 position:50% align:center
and they don't age.

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:06.663 position:50% align:center
They're damn-near immortal.

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:09.958 position:50% align:center
Even among kemono,
they're an advanced breed.

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:13.003 position:50% align:center
Anyway, Mihai can't
stand being bored.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:17.132 position:50% align:center
So, over time, he's managed to
become a pro at most everything.

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:19.884 position:50% align:center
After he ran out of things
to do and started feeling

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:23.346 position:50% align:center
world-weary, I invited
him to come here.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.850 position:50% align:center
Once he moved in, he got
obsessed with online games.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.059 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Uh...

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:30.478 position:50% align:center
He's usually pretty
mellow when he plays,

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:31.688 position:50% align:center
but if his mood turns sour,

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.565 position:50% align:center
there's no telling
what he'll do.

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:35.233 position:50% align:center
And you brought that
lunatic here why?

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:36.693 position:50% align:center
I had to.

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:39.237 position:50% align:center
I... suck at tech stuff.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.072 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:43.950 position:50% align:center
I mean, he's the one who
created the office website.

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:45.702 position:50% align:center
And he makes sure
your cell phone data

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:49.122 position:50% align:center
doesn't get leaked to Inari
and a bunch of other stuff.

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:51.166 position:50% align:center
There's no doubt he
comes in handy.

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:55.503 position:50% align:center
Just make sure to stay away
from that room, okay?

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:58.131 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI] Seriously?!
You're back here again?

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:00.884 position:50% align:center
Listen, I don't care if you
are a vampire or whatever.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.386 position:50% align:center
You don't get to treat
Kabane like a slave!

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.388 position:50% align:center
We're not supposed
to go near him.

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:07.515 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but I've
been appointed, so...

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:11.394 position:50% align:center
Wonderful. You kids are
all so bothersome.

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:14.606 position:50% align:center
I fear this is going to put
a crimp in my guild life.

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.358 position:50% align:center
Quit pushing him around!

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:17.525 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you what.

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:21.446 position:50% align:center

this by arm wrestling?

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.699 position:50% align:center
If you guys win the match,
I'll set him free immediately.

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:26.576 position:50% align:center

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:27.952 position:50% align:center

he has brute strength,

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.792 position:50% align:center
but the dude is still a vampire.

just toying with you.

to pick up some food.

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:30.473 position:50% align:center
[KABANE] I gave it my all,
but I couldn't beat him.

composed too.

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:35.854 position:50% align:center
Pretty impressive.

protect the others.

Lady Inari doesn't
need it anymore,

need your head, either.

it to her last time.

But when I got to her office,

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:42.921 position:50% align:center
she already had a new

It was awful.

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:51.179 position:50% align:center
Lady Inari never even
looked at me once.

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:54.724 position:50% align:center
I know it's because
I wasn't a good girl.

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:18.433 position:50% align:center
Look at this. That boy
Kabane broke my wrist.

How lovely. Boy must have
quite the backstory.

just sitting around,

I thought I'd give you
a hand in the office.

Wait, what?

Ah, perfect...

[INUGAMI]
Hey!

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:42.415 position:50% align:center
Aw, why'd you send a reply?

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:44.542 position:50% align:center
You're gonna be
responsible for this.

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50% align:center
Why me?

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:47.379 position:50% align:center
Because you accepted the job!

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:49.756 position:50% align:center
I'm sure those boys
can handle it.

Yeah, but this one's no joke.

If we fail, someone could die!

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.307 position:50% align:center
Well, I did have my game
taken away from me.

00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:00.975 position:50% align:center
The punishment
should fit the crime,

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:02.435 position:50% align:center
so I have no problem with that.

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:04.396 position:50% align:center

00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:40.765 position:50% align:center
why don't you come to Inugami's?

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.186 position:50% align:center
I think he'd be happy to
give you a place to stay.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.605 position:50% align:center
He helped me, after all.

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:49.566 position:50% align:center
Well?

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:53.111 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but... I just can't.

I mean, I'm a kitsune.

00:11:00.744 --> 00:11:03.663 position:50% align:center
But I know for sure I could
live with you, Kabane.

00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:06.458 position:50% align:center
Being the minion of a tanuki
doesn't make you one, too.

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:08.209 position:50% align:center
And there are sparrows
and pigeons here,

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:10.253 position:50% align:center
so I'm in no danger of starving.

00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:12.589 position:50% align:center
We can live here, together,
just the two of us!

Not a mission, exactly.
Just a chore I have to do.

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:30.690 position:50% align:center
Once I get finished with that,
I can come back here.

You can? How long
will it take you?

I'm not really sure.

00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:38.114 position:50% align:center
But not too long, I imagine.

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:40.200 position:50% align:center
Should be pretty quick.

Hi, everyone, I'm back.

You're later than usual.
What kept you so long?

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:57.967 position:50% align:center
We just got assigned a job.

00:11:58.051 --> 00:12:01.429 position:50% align:center
Inugami told ya he was gonna
have us handle it, right?

00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:04.683 position:50% align:center
Indeed. He said he was
dealing with another matter.

00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:06.810 position:50% align:center
Sounds good. Count me in!

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:09.688 position:50% align:center
Why're you so excited?
What's up with you?

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:13.900 position:50% align:center
Well, there's just a little
something that I'd like to try.

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.110 position:50% align:center
Heh!

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:35.839 position:50% align:center
Ugh. It's so hot!

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:37.841 position:50% align:center
Okay. Here goes.

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:41.469 position:50% align:center
Woah! No way!

00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:43.013 position:50% align:center
How is he doing that?

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:43.930 position:50% align:center
Pretty cool.

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:46.266 position:50% align:center
Huh. That's using your head.

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:47.142 position:50% align:center
Well done.

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:59.612 position:50% align:center
I've wanted a chance to
test it out, so this is great.

00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:03.742 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI]
Bugbite Electronic.

00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:06.619 position:50% align:center
Three years ago, sixteen people
committed suicide

00:13:06.703 --> 00:13:08.621 position:50% align:center
in a single year at
one of their plants.

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:11.916 position:50% align:center
They were bashed by the public
and in danger of going bankrupt.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.003 position:50% align:center
But the year after, the company
underwent a huge turnaround

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:16.921 position:50% align:center
and had zero suicides.

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:19.507 position:50% align:center
Suddenly, their
notoriety vanished.

00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:21.926 position:50% align:center
A weirdly quick recovery.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.553 position:50% align:center
So, for your mission.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:25.305 position:50% align:center
You need to grab
any info regarding

00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:27.640 position:50% align:center
how they got their
suicide numbers down.

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:29.184 position:50% align:center
Copy that!

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:32.020 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful Inugami was cool
enough to let us handle it!

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:34.397 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, I'd say it just
goes to show how much

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:35.648 position:50% align:center

Good. The other two have
taken up standby positions.

00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:51.706 position:50% align:center
The rest will depend on how
well the Arachne kid does.

00:14:03.802 --> 00:14:06.054 position:50% align:center
Heh! Too easy.

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:09.224 position:50% align:center

This is the Mihai Magnum,

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:14.562 position:50% align:center

00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:18.274 position:50% align:center
when I was known as the
Transylvanian Vanishing Bullet.

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:20.276 position:50% align:center
Not only is it
remote controlled,

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.779 position:50% align:center
it's silent and
optically camouflaged.

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:24.239 position:50% align:center
And equipped with cameras.

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:25.573 position:50% align:center
On top of that,

00:14:25.657 --> 00:14:27.492 position:50% align:center
it's loaded up with all
kinds of other fun stuff.

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:29.994 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be your go-to
partner for this mission.

"optical camouflage"

tech for it, anyway?

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:38.878 position:50% align:center
I did a stint in the

00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:42.465 position:50% align:center

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:28.882 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, we need the CEO
as our frontman right now.

00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:32.635 position:50% align:center
Oh. Up already?

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:38.433 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Okay, take care of yourself!

00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:41.311 position:50% align:center
Keep up the good work,
just like you always do!

00:17:43.855 --> 00:17:46.316 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI gasps]
What's the heck's going on?

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:49.361 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me that guy's
clocking back in.

00:17:49.444 --> 00:17:51.988 position:50% align:center
From the way it looked,
he had his ear punctured.

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:54.908 position:50% align:center
She said, "why are
brains so good?"

00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:58.286 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI]
Hmm. Hold on a minute.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.414 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI grumbles]
How the hell does this work?

00:18:01.498 --> 00:18:02.665 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI]
Inugami.

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:04.250 position:50% align:center
Whaddya want?

00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:07.379 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI] You familiar with any
brain-sucking mosquito kemono?

00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:09.881 position:50% align:center
Uh? Oh, yeah, kanonba!

00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:11.716 position:50% align:center
They drink blood,
like you'd expect.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.761 position:50% align:center
But they dig organs
and brains, too!

00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:17.722 position:50% align:center
Wait! Is that what
they're up against?

00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:20.266 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI] They aren't sucking out
their blood or other organs.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.269 position:50% align:center
Only their brains, so they
can leave them alive.

00:18:23.353 --> 00:18:25.647 position:50% align:center
It's likely that most of
those lethargic workers

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.400 position:50% align:center
in there have already
been sucked dry.

00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:32.278 position:50% align:center
Then, the trick to their
suicide numbers falling...

00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:34.739 position:50% align:center
No brains, no suicides.

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:37.992 position:50% align:center
Someone who can't think
can't contemplate death.

00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:40.245 position:50% align:center
Going by what we heard,
those mosquito kemono

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:42.622 position:50% align:center
are definitely
behind the change.

00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:44.749 position:50% align:center
And there were three
of them in there.

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:46.001 position:50% align:center
That's tough.

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:48.420 position:50% align:center
Understood. Let's go
take them out.

00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:50.296 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
Didn't you hear what I said?

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.549 position:50% align:center
We have no chance
against three of them!

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:54.384 position:50% align:center
There are three
of us, too, though.

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:56.553 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
Come on, you can't count Akira!

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:59.472 position:50% align:center
I guarantee that he's fainted
after what just happened.

00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:04.019 position:50% align:center
Let's secure an entry route
and retreat for now.

00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
We can come back after we
discuss it with Inugami

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:08.732 position:50% align:center
and brainstorm a plan.

00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:10.734 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
All right. I'll follow you.

00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:13.319 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--[SHIKI] Okay.

00:19:13.403 --> 00:19:15.447 position:50% align:center
What's the matter
with these guys?

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.824 position:50% align:center
It's not right for children
to be this cautious.

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center
Absolutely no fun at all.

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:22.037 position:50% align:center
That one seems like
the ringleader.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.497 position:50% align:center
The Arachne hanyo, Shiki.

00:19:24.581 --> 00:19:28.126 position:50% align:center
His un-childlike rationality
is incredibly boring.

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:30.754 position:50% align:center
What a waste of a young mind.

00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:33.423 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI]
Fine, then. Guess you win, kid.

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:36.551 position:50% align:center
If that's how you wanna play it,
I'll just drop the hammer.

00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:40.930 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI gasps]

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:42.223 position:50% align:center
[WOMEN]
Huh?

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:48.104 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Whoa! Stop that!
Come on, what are you doing?

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:51.274 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI grunts]

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:53.735 position:50% align:center
How strange. I wonder
what that was?

00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:56.529 position:50% align:center
I'll check. Ugh.

00:20:02.077 --> 00:20:03.828 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:06.164 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Hang on. A toy?

00:20:06.247 --> 00:20:07.791 position:50% align:center
Was that what we heard?

00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:16.466 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Hm...

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:17.759 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
Anything weird?

00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:21.888 position:50% align:center
Nu-uh. There was nothing to see.

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:24.724 position:50% align:center
A box of equipment must've
fallen over or something.

00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:26.643 position:50% align:center
It sound like that to you?

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:28.520 position:50% align:center
It is curious, isn't it?

00:20:28.603 --> 00:20:32.607 position:50% align:center
What do you say we check around
a little bit before we leave.

00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center
I'll take the factory.

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:35.527 position:50% align:center
Why don't you two
try scoping ou--

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.445 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Yeah, I'll take this area, here.

00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:39.447 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA] Fine, I'll check
the first floor.

00:20:39.531 --> 00:20:40.615 position:50% align:center
[REIKA]
See to it.

00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:43.284 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
Be cool. Stay calm.

00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:44.703 position:50% align:center
They may have found
Mihai's little car,

00:20:44.786 --> 00:20:47.914 position:50% align:center
but he's probably got
a plan. It's fine.

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:49.791 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:20:53.962 --> 00:20:56.006 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
All I have to do is quietly

00:20:56.089 --> 00:20:57.882 position:50% align:center
and carefully
get out of here.

00:20:57.966 --> 00:20:59.384 position:50% align:center
That's easy.

00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:03.430 position:50% align:center
If I can get to a window,
I can climb out using my silk.

00:21:03.513 --> 00:21:06.683 position:50% align:center
But... what if I screw up?

00:21:09.227 --> 00:21:13.481 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] Well! Whaddya know,
someone is here.

00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:16.234 position:50% align:center
I had to look closely,
or I would've missed you.

00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:18.319 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:18.403 --> 00:21:22.282 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] See, if we kill anyone,
the kitsune will get wind of us.

00:21:22.365 --> 00:21:24.284 position:50% align:center
And Reika doesn't want that.

00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:27.871 position:50% align:center
But given the circumstances,
what choice is there?

00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:32.709 position:50% align:center
After all, you've seen us now.
What else is a girl to do?

00:21:33.877 --> 00:21:37.756 position:50% align:center
--[ERIKA shouts]
--[SHIKI gasps]

00:21:40.342 --> 00:21:42.969 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI] Why are you sitting
there like a slack-jawed idiot?

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:46.014 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI] If I hadn't
gone on the offensive,

00:21:46.097 --> 00:21:47.974 position:50% align:center
you would be dead by now.

00:21:48.058 --> 00:21:49.351 position:50% align:center
What are you waiting for?

00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:50.769 position:50% align:center
Hurry and get up.

00:21:54.272 --> 00:21:57.567 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI] Mm? Hold on.
Something's wrong.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:01.321 position:50% align:center
[pants]

00:22:01.404 --> 00:22:03.656 position:50% align:center
That's it. He's traumatized.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.242 position:50% align:center
He's been through something
hard in his past.

00:22:06.326 --> 00:22:08.411 position:50% align:center
So much for rationality,
I guess.

00:22:08.495 --> 00:22:12.123 position:50% align:center
All that caution's just a
false front to conceal fear.

00:22:12.207 --> 00:22:15.460 position:50% align:center
Oh, he's going to be so
much fun to mess with!
