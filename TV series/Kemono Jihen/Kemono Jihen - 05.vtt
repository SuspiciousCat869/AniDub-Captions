I thought I'd give you
a hand in the office.

Wait, what?

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:38.411 position:50% align:center

Ah, perfect...

[INUGAMI]
Hey!

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:42.415 position:50% align:center
Aw, why'd you send a reply?

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:44.542 position:50% align:center
You're gonna be
responsible for this.

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50% align:center
Why me?

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:47.379 position:50% align:center
Because you accepted the job!

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:49.756 position:50% align:center
I'm sure those boys
can handle it.

[INUGAMI]
Yeah, but this one's no joke.

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:56.596 position:50% align:center
If we fail, someone could die!

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.307 position:50% align:center
Well, I did have my game
taken away from me.

00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:00.975 position:50% align:center
The punishment
should fit the crime,

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:02.435 position:50% align:center
so I have no problem with that.

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:04.396 position:50% align:center
Wha-- Eh-- Ah!

00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:40.765 position:50% align:center
why don't you come to Inugami's?

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.186 position:50% align:center
I think he'd be happy to
give you a place to stay.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.605 position:50% align:center
He helped me, after all.

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:49.566 position:50% align:center
Well?

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:53.111 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but... I just can't.

I mean, I'm a kitsune.

00:11:00.744 --> 00:11:03.663 position:50% align:center
But I know for sure I could
live with you, Kabane.

00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:06.458 position:50% align:center
Being the minion of a tanuki
doesn't make you one, too.

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:08.209 position:50% align:center
And there are sparrows
and pigeons here,

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:10.253 position:50% align:center
so I'm in no danger of starving.

00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:12.589 position:50% align:center
We can live here, together,
just the two of us!

Not a mission, exactly.
Just a chore I have to do.

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:30.690 position:50% align:center
Once I get finished with that,
I can come back here.

00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:33.777 position:50% align:center
You can? How long
will it take you?

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.653 position:50% align:center
I'm not really sure.

00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:38.114 position:50% align:center
But not too long, I imagine.

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:40.200 position:50% align:center
Should be pretty quick.

Yay.

Hi, everyone, I'm back.

You're later than usual.
What kept you so long?

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:57.967 position:50% align:center
We just got assigned a job.

00:11:58.051 --> 00:12:01.429 position:50% align:center
Inugami told ya he was gonna
have us handle it, right?

00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:04.683 position:50% align:center
Indeed. He said he was
dealing with another matter.

00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:06.810 position:50% align:center
Sounds good. Count me in!

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:09.688 position:50% align:center
Why're you so excited?
What's up with you?

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:13.900 position:50% align:center
Well, there's just a little
something that I'd like to try.

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.110 position:50% align:center
Heh!

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:35.839 position:50% align:center
Ugh. It's so hot!

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:37.841 position:50% align:center
Okay. Here goes.

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:41.469 position:50% align:center
Woah! No way!

00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:43.013 position:50% align:center
How is he doing that?

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:43.930 position:50% align:center
Pretty cool.

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:46.266 position:50% align:center
Huh. That's using your head.

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:47.142 position:50% align:center
Well done.

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:59.612 position:50% align:center
I've wanted a chance to
test it out, so this is great.

00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:03.742 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI]
Bugbite Electronic.

00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:06.619 position:50% align:center
Three years ago, sixteen people
committed suicide

00:13:06.703 --> 00:13:08.621 position:50% align:center
in a single year at
one of their plants.

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:11.916 position:50% align:center
They were bashed by the public
and in danger of going bankrupt.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.003 position:50% align:center
But the year after, the company
underwent a huge turnaround

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:16.921 position:50% align:center
and had zero suicides.

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:19.507 position:50% align:center
Suddenly, their
notoriety vanished.

00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:21.926 position:50% align:center
A weirdly quick recovery.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.553 position:50% align:center
So, for your mission.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:25.305 position:50% align:center
You need to grab
any info regarding

00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:27.640 position:50% align:center
how they got their
suicide numbers down.

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:29.184 position:50% align:center
Copy that!

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:32.020 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful Inugami was cool
enough to let us handle it!

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:34.397 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, I'd say it just
goes to show how much

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:35.648 position:50% align:center

Good. The other two have
taken up standby positions.

00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:51.706 position:50% align:center
The rest will depend on how
well the Arachne kid does.

00:14:03.802 --> 00:14:06.054 position:50% align:center
Heh! Too easy.

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:09.224 position:50% align:center

hell's that thing for?

This is the Mihai Magnum,

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:14.562 position:50% align:center

00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:18.274 position:50% align:center
when I was known as the
Transylvanian Vanishing Bullet.

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:20.276 position:50% align:center
Not only is it
remote controlled,

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.779 position:50% align:center
it's silent and
optically camouflaged.

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:24.239 position:50% align:center
And equipped with cameras.

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:25.573 position:50% align:center
On top of that,

00:14:25.657 --> 00:14:27.492 position:50% align:center
it's loaded up with all
kinds of other fun stuff.

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:29.994 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be your go-to
partner for this mission.

"optical camouflage"

00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:36.084 position:50% align:center
tech for it, anyway?

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:38.878 position:50% align:center
I did a stint in the
military once upon a time.

00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:42.465 position:50% align:center
Back then, everyone called me
the Transylvanian Reaper.

Wait! Is that what
they're up against?

00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:20.266 position:50% align:center
[MIHAI] They aren't sucking out
their blood or other organs.

Only their brains, so they
can leave them alive.

It's likely that most of
those lethargic workers

been sucked dry.

can't contemplate death.

Going by what we heard,

behind the change.
