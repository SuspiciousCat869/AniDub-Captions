00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.222 position:50% align:center
[MALE CHILD A] Woah, is it
true he's coming from Tokyo?

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:16.182 position:50% align:center
[MALE CHILD B] He'll be
stayin' over at Yat's place.

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.767 position:50% align:center
[MALE CHILD C]
Wonder what he's like.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.186 position:50% align:center
[MALE CHILD B] Ya never know.
Maybe he's comin' to recruit ya!

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.563 position:50% align:center
For what?

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:22.772 position:50% align:center
I mean, think about it.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.774 position:50% align:center
You're smart and you
can run really fast,

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.317 position:50% align:center
and on top of that, you're rich.

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:29.779 position:50% align:center
"You belong in Tokyo,
not in some backwoods town.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.949 position:50% align:center
Won't you come with me?
Oh, you must."

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.451 position:50% align:center
[MALE CHILD C]
Hey, can we come by later

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.327 position:50% align:center
to see the guy from Tokyo?

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:37.746 position:50% align:center
[MALE CHILD B]
Like, real quick?

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.081 position:50% align:center
So long as you're not disturbing
our guest, then sure.

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:41.583 position:50% align:center
[MALE CHILD A]
Heck, yeah!

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:45.503 position:50% align:center
[YATARO]
Hm? Dorotabo! You can't come!

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:48.465 position:50% align:center
Don't want the guy from
Tokyo gettin' a whiff o' ya!

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:51.885 position:50% align:center
[MALE CHILDREN laugh]

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:55.472 position:50% align:center
Right. I'll be careful.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.896 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI exhales]
Gimme a break, man.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.523 position:50% align:center
'Course, I get a flat
tire way out here.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.029 position:50% align:center
You the guy from Tokyo?

00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:12.739 position:50% align:center
You my client?

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:14.866 position:50% align:center
[YATARO'S MOTHER]
I'm the hostess of Kanoko Villa.

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:16.451 position:50% align:center
I'll send someone
to fix this up.

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:19.454 position:50% align:center
If you wanna ride with me,
we can talk on the drive.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:26.211 position:50% align:center
[YATARO'S MOTHER]
The bodies're all... rotting.

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:29.714 position:50% align:center
Livestock that was just fine
yesterday, gone overnight.

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:32.092 position:50% align:center
Is that even somethin'
humans can do?

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:34.719 position:50% align:center
It's got everybody
feeling so spooked.

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:36.054 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Mm-hm...

00:01:37.514 --> 00:01:39.140 position:50% align:center
[YATARO'S MOTHER] I still
haven't told the children

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:41.226 position:50% align:center
anything about this whole mess.

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:44.479 position:50% align:center
I don't want them to get scared
and stop goin' to school.

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:47.774 position:50% align:center
And if the kids are
affected by this somehow...

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:51.111 position:50% align:center
Well, I don't need any
rumors startin', neither.

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:53.363 position:50% align:center
I hope we can keep
this between us.

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:54.739 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:57.742 position:50% align:center
It just so happens that
discretion is our specialty.

00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:02.080 position:50% align:center
Cause I mean, I am
a detective, after all.

00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:04.457 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:07.419 position:50% align:center
You stick out like a
sore thumb in that outfit.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.424 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI sighs]
Thanks for the ride.

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:15.677 position:50% align:center
Sorry to leave changing
my tire up to you.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.388 position:50% align:center
Bill me for whatever
you need later.

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:20.390 position:50% align:center
Sure, that sounds fine.

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.350 position:50% align:center
[MALE CHILDREN gasp]

00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:23.643 position:50% align:center
[YATARO chuckles]

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:26.229 position:50% align:center
--[INUGAMI] Boo!
--[MALE CHILD A] Yikes!

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:29.733 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI laughs]
I like it way out here.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.443 position:50% align:center
It's nice and relaxed.

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:35.030 position:50% align:center
I even saw a bunch of
wild deer on the way in.

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:38.033 position:50% align:center
Our village is kind
of known for them.

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:39.701 position:50% align:center
We even keep a head
count to make sure

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:41.536 position:50% align:center
there's no harm done to 'em.

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:43.246 position:50% align:center
You don't say.

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:51.963 position:50% align:center
Hey, kiddo! You doing okay?

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.639 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Wow, quite the hard worker.

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:04.934 position:50% align:center
Or maybe he's just
shy around strangers.

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:07.771 position:50% align:center
It doesn't look like he
randomly skipped school.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:11.649 position:50% align:center
Does he always stay home to
work or is this a weird day?

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:14.527 position:50% align:center
I'll fill you in later,
all right?

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:16.279 position:50% align:center
[splashing]

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:18.114 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI groans]

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:21.785 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI] A client with a hot
spring is the way to go!

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.996 position:50% align:center
[YATARO]
Pardon the intrusion!

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:28.166 position:50% align:center
[YATARO]
May I wash your back, sir?

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:30.585 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Just gimme a second.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:35.882 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Oh.

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:38.510 position:50% align:center
You're one of those kids
from earlier, aren't ya?

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:41.471 position:50% align:center
My name is Yataro.
I'm the hostess's son.

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:43.223 position:50% align:center
I'll be personally
seeing to your needs

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:44.808 position:50% align:center
during your stay with us.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.685 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:49.104 position:50% align:center
[YATARO] I understand
you're from Tokyo, sir.

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:50.397 position:50% align:center
That must be nice!

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.982 position:50% align:center
The city has everything,
doesn't it?

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.318 position:50% align:center
Also, your car is
seriously cool!

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:57.153 position:50% align:center
Everybody's been saying so.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.697 position:50% align:center
You know,

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.490 position:50% align:center
I think I'd really like to move
to the city when I grow up.

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:02.158 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Is that right?

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.703 position:50% align:center
Oh! Please don't try to tell
my mother that, though.

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:07.497 position:50% align:center
She insists that I
take over the inn.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.748 position:50% align:center
Sure, kid.

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:10.875 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which,
I was asking your mother.

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.378 position:50% align:center
You folks have another boy
living here, don't ya?

00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:16.006 position:50% align:center
Ah. I take it you mean Dorotabo.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.340 position:50% align:center
Like, "mud boy."

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:18.800 position:50% align:center
[YATARO]
It's a nickname.

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:21.094 position:50% align:center
He gets covered with dirt
and manure working outside,

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:22.804 position:50% align:center
so it seemed like a good fit.

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:25.724 position:50% align:center
It's the name of the yokai
that live in the fields.

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
Also, his body odor has
always been awful,

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:30.353 position:50% align:center
so we can't have him doing work

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:32.397 position:50% align:center
where he's around
other people, you know?

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.523 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Hm...

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.191 position:50% align:center
[YATARO grunts]

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.987 position:50% align:center
Well, now I'm interested.

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:43.950 position:50% align:center
Hey! That was a great soak.

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center
[YATARO'S MOTHER]
I'm glad to hear it.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:48.413 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
I was wondering, ma'am.

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:50.123 position:50% align:center
[YATARO'S MOTHER]
Hm?

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:51.708 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Yataro, was it?

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:54.210 position:50% align:center
The boy who was attending to me?

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:55.045 position:50% align:center
[YATARO'S MOTHER]
Yes.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.338 position:50% align:center
Here comes the praise!

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:57.839 position:50% align:center
"You've got a very capable boy."

00:04:57.922 --> 00:05:01.051 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI] Could I possibly
request Dorotabo instead?

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:02.344 position:50% align:center
[YATARO]
Huh?

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:06.264 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
You want me to wait on him?

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:08.808 position:50% align:center
He actually insisted.

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:10.560 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
I've never done that.

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.145 position:50% align:center
[YATARO'S MOTHER]
You just need to use your head

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:14.064 position:50% align:center
and do your best.

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:28.620 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Excuse me.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.833 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI] Oh, you made it.
Been waiting for ya.

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:37.587 position:50% align:center
Remember me? We met yesterday.

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:38.880 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Yes.

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:46.846 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Your breakfast... Pardon me.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.391 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Woah there! Not so fast, kiddo.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:52.894 position:50% align:center
Easy...

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:56.189 position:50% align:center
Here, it's my card.

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
It's got all my info on it.

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:02.696 position:50% align:center
Basically, I'm a detective that
specializes in the occult,

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:05.115 position:50% align:center
and I'm in town for
an investigation.

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:07.867 position:50% align:center
I'd like to hear what
everyone's got to say.

00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:09.536 position:50% align:center
This looks great!

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.955 position:50% align:center
You're out in the
fields every day, huh?

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:14.374 position:50% align:center
So, you ever see
anything strange?

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:16.960 position:50% align:center
You can tell me while I eat.

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:19.004 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
How about after breakfast?

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:20.630 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Hm?

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:22.674 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
I don't want to spoil your meal.

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:24.801 position:50% align:center
Aw, don't worry about me.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:27.387 position:50% align:center
I've got a pretty
high tolerance.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.889 position:50% align:center
I can still eat,
even if it's gory.

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:31.933 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
No, that isn't it.

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.518 position:50% align:center
It's just that.

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:36.938 position:50% align:center
None of the others at the inn
ever take their meals with me.

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:39.941 position:50% align:center
They all say I smell.

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:41.317 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah?

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:45.572 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI] Us guys shouldn't
mind how we smell, right?

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:48.658 position:50% align:center
The place where I work is
entirely stag and it stinks!

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:50.744 position:50% align:center
Like, pee-yew!

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:53.288 position:50% align:center
Girls walk by and they
all make faces like this

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.623 position:50% align:center
until they're out of range.

00:06:55.707 --> 00:06:58.168 position:50% align:center
Is that right?

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:00.879 position:50% align:center
Well, if you're okay with it.

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:03.715 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Yeah. Go right ahead.

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:05.842 position:50% align:center
[KABANE] Your investigation
deals with our rotting

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:08.011 position:50% align:center
livestock carcasses, right?

00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:11.598 position:50% align:center
How did you find out about that?

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:14.601 position:50% align:center
The hostess said she
hadn't told anybody yet.

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:17.354 position:50% align:center
[KABANE] It's my job to
dispose of the bodies.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.730 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Hm...

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:21.691 position:50% align:center
Up to now, there have
been six that have died.

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:23.610 position:50% align:center
Many of them have been chickens.

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:26.154 position:50% align:center
And every last one of them
has had all their organs

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:28.865 position:50% align:center
completely chewed up.

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:31.368 position:50% align:center
If there were monsters
in this world,

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:34.621 position:50% align:center

they would do.

Also, you may have
already heard this,

but I always have to dispose
of the bodies the morning after

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:42.921 position:50% align:center
the new moon.

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:44.923 position:50% align:center

something will happen

[INUGAMI chuckles]

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:51.841 position:50% align:center
That's because your
posture is all wrong.

[INUGAMI] By the way, I've been
wondering about something.

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:03.728 position:50% align:center
That thing hanging
around your neck.

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:08.066 position:50% align:center
What is it? A stone?

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:10.568 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
This thing?

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:11.945 position:50% align:center
They found it on me.

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:13.947 position:50% align:center
When I was a baby.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.075 position:50% align:center
It probably belonged
to my parents.

00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:19.369 position:50% align:center
I was abandoned, so...

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:21.162 position:50% align:center
May I take a look?

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:22.455 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Sure.

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:30.296 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Hm...

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:35.093 position:50% align:center

Yeah, I thought as much.

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:36.970 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Hm?

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:39.305 position:50% align:center
This right here is
called a "lifestone".

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:42.017 position:50% align:center
Only formed under
special circumstances.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.687 position:50% align:center
There's a certain component that
only exists within this stone,

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.523 position:50% align:center
which makes it a precious
object in that regard.

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:52.068 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't leave it with
a kid you're throwing away.

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:54.112 position:50% align:center
There must be some
reason why the inn hostess

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:56.448 position:50% align:center
had to take you in.

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:59.200 position:50% align:center
But you were
not abandoned, kiddo.

Uh!

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.969 position:50% align:center

after all.

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center

From times of yore,

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:23.863 position:50% align:center
there have been beings
who lurk in the shadows,

00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:26.741 position:50% align:center
living among humans,
but undetected by them,

00:14:26.825 --> 00:14:28.326 position:50% align:center
known as kemono.

Traditionally, Kemono shy
away from humans.

00:14:31.705 --> 00:14:34.541 position:50% align:center
However, more recently,
some have found themselves

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:36.918 position:50% align:center
unnecessarily
entangled with man.

multiple have been reported.

And as for that lifestone
your parents left ya,

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:08.992 position:50% align:center
it prevents your "thirst"
from manifesting.

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:10.368 position:50% align:center
To put it more simply,

00:15:10.452 --> 00:15:13.204 position:50% align:center
it'll keep you from
impulsively attacking people.

00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:17.292 position:50% align:center
As long as you have that stone,
you can remain a human.

be pinned on me.

Yeah, you're right about that.

You see, she knows
what you really are.

00:18:18.473 --> 00:18:20.517 position:50% align:center
She learned all about it
when she took you in

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.145 position:50% align:center
from her older sister,
your mother.

00:18:24.229 --> 00:18:26.898 position:50% align:center
She hadn't told anyone
else all this time,

00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:29.359 position:50% align:center
but due to these latest events,

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:33.571 position:50% align:center
she made up her mind to
have you killed. In secret.

00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:36.741 position:50% align:center

was something else,

00:18:39.077 --> 00:18:41.037 position:50% align:center
Well, I doubt
she'd believe me.

better like this, anyway.
