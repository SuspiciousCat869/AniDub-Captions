[AKIRA] This is the first
trip we've taken together!

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:16.850 position:50% align:center
Though, I would've
preferred the beach 

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.560 position:50% align:center
since I grew up
in the mountains.

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:20.812 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kabane, you want
some chocolate?

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:23.064 position:50% align:center
Someone's definitely
enjoying themself.

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:25.442 position:50% align:center
--[AKIRA giggles]
--It isn't a vacation, you know?

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.360 position:50% align:center
Congrats. It's exciting.

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:30.030 position:50% align:center
Seeing your parents.

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:32.323 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
Who said I'm gonna see them?

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:35.201 position:50% align:center
We might be able to track
'em down, that's all.

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:37.662 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:40.081 position:50% align:center
I thought you said you didn't
wanna know about your parents.

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:42.208 position:50% align:center
Did you have a change
of heart or what?

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:44.127 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
Quit smiling!

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:49.758 position:50% align:center
Truth is, yeah, I wanna find out
what actually happened to 'em.

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:52.594 position:50% align:center
I've just been running away
from all this for a long time

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:54.554 position:50% align:center
cuz I was too scared.

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:56.681 position:50% align:center
But now, I think I'm ready.

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:58.558 position:50% align:center
I have a place where I belong.

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:01.603 position:50% align:center
And good friends
that have my back!

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:05.440 position:50% align:center
If you dare tell them I said
that, you're dead to me!

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:10.528 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:37.866 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
So the place we're headed

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.701 position:50% align:center
is where you
were born, right?

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:42.829 position:50% align:center
And once we get there, we're
gonna meet up with your uncle?

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:44.164 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
Yeah.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:47.292 position:50% align:center
I lived with my him before
I moved in with Inugami.

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:50.503 position:50% align:center
And before that, I lived
around here with my mom.

00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:55.717 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA giggles]
Look at all the cute stuff here!

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.261 position:50% align:center
I'm going to the inn
to get us settled.

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:00.972 position:50% align:center
You guys can do whatever
you want till I get back.

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:02.265 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Kay!

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:05.727 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Hm. Which one should I get?

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.771 position:50% align:center
You're already buying souvenirs?

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.064 position:50% align:center
[KABANE grunts]

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:12.859 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kabane. Find anything?

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:14.736 position:50% align:center
Some kinda... book?

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:15.987 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's that one.

00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:18.239 position:50% align:center
It's a pretty famous old
folk tale 'round here.

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:20.367 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah? What's it about?

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.786 position:50% align:center
[KABANE] "Once upon a time,
not too far from here,

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.747 position:50% align:center
there was a poor young
man named Shige.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.875 position:50% align:center
One day, when Shige
returned home from work,

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:32.212 position:50% align:center
he noticed that a spider
was going through his food.

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:34.255 position:50% align:center
The kindhearted Shige
was happy to share

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.341 position:50% align:center
what he had with
the spider, saying,

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:38.385 position:50% align:center
'There's not much here,
but please,

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:40.261 position:50% align:center
make yourself at home.'

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:42.889 position:50% align:center
The next day,
he couldn't believe it.

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:46.101 position:50% align:center
He had awoken to the sight of
beautiful golden spider webs 

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:49.354 position:50% align:center
adorning the ceiling of
his tiny run-down shack.

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:51.398 position:50% align:center
Shige sold the spider silk,

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:54.734 position:50% align:center
and with his new wealth
lived happily ever after."

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:56.152 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Huh.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:58.738 position:50% align:center
You'll find stories
like that everywhere.

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.375 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Shiki. What's the matter?

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:11.960 position:50% align:center
Nothing.

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:17.173 position:50% align:center
That kid was glaring
at me real hard.

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.967 position:50% align:center
Wow! That's weird.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.385 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't think
of you as the type

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:21.594 position:50% align:center
kids would
find interesting.

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:23.513 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
What did you just say?

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.060 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Oh, there you are.

00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:30.311 position:50% align:center
Surprise.

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.731 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't you know it,
I ran into Mr. Tademaru.

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:34.149 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI gasps]

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:36.276 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI] Sooner than planned,
but them's the breaks.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:38.737 position:50% align:center
Hey there, Shiki!
S'been a while!

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.155 position:50% align:center
Oh, hi!

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:43.616 position:50% align:center
[AKIO] When was it
that you left, again?

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.494 position:50% align:center
You haven't exactly written very
often since you moved away.

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:48.663 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Shiki! So rude.

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:50.582 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
Shut up.

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:52.876 position:50% align:center
--[KUMI] Shiki.
--[SHIKI] Mm?

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.298 position:50% align:center
[AKIO]
Let me start from the top.

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:02.927 position:50% align:center
I'm Tademaru Akio, and Shiki's
father is my older brother.

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:05.138 position:50% align:center
I'm also a bit of a folklorist.

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:06.639 position:50% align:center
What's a folklorist?

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:07.974 position:50% align:center
They study legends.

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:09.267 position:50% align:center
Wow! That's cool!

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:12.145 position:50% align:center
[AKIO chuckles]
Oh, I just dabble.

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:16.274 position:50% align:center
Also, despite him being a human,
my uncle knows about us kemono.

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:17.817 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Huh?

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:21.029 position:50% align:center
Listen, I have no intention of
jeopardizing your existence.

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:23.823 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't want to make
Inugami angry, would I?

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:26.368 position:50% align:center
So, are all of you
Shiki's friends?

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:28.453 position:50% align:center
They're just people
I work with.

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:30.789 position:50% align:center
What? How could you say that?

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:31.998 position:50% align:center
Yeah okay, buddy.

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:34.167 position:50% align:center
Inugami, you better
keep your mouth shut!

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.669 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kabane.

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:38.171 position:50% align:center
What do you say we eat Shiki's
share of the snacks later?

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:42.884 position:50% align:center
Huh... I have to tell you,
this is a pleasant surprise!

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:46.554 position:50% align:center
Imagine. Little Shiki growing
up to be so even-tempered.

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:49.307 position:50% align:center
[KABANE] Why? What was he
like when he was younger?

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:51.017 position:50% align:center
Oh, I hardly knew
what to do with him.

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.560 position:50% align:center
He was such a handful.

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:54.437 position:50% align:center
Always getting into fights.

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.064 position:50% align:center
I was right to let
him go to Inugami's.

00:05:56.147 --> 00:05:57.649 position:50% align:center
Enough!

00:05:57.732 --> 00:06:00.110 position:50% align:center
We didn't come here to listen to
embarrassing stories about me!

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.278 position:50% align:center
[AKIO]
Sorry, sorry.

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:06.116 position:50% align:center
You're here to learn about
your mother, aren't you?

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.992 position:50% align:center
Back when I was still in school.

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:09.452 position:50% align:center
I tagged along with my brother

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:11.329 position:50% align:center
on one of his trips
into these woods

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:14.165 position:50% align:center
to research the
folklore of Kinshigo.

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:15.583 position:50% align:center
Like what?

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.460 position:50% align:center
[AKIO]
The Legend of Nishikigumo.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:18.920 position:50% align:center
Surely you've heard of it.

00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:20.463 position:50% align:center
The one about the spider?

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:22.674 position:50% align:center
But that was
made up, wasn't it?

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:24.551 position:50% align:center
There are countless
types of folk material,

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:26.803 position:50% align:center
old legends are just one.

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:31.016 position:50% align:center
Many are inspired by true events
that happened in people's lives.

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.643 position:50% align:center
So perhaps the Legend of
Nishikigumo originated

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.937 position:50% align:center
from something real.
With that thought,

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:39.024 position:50% align:center
my brother and I headed
deep into the woods.

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:43.445 position:50% align:center
And that... is where we
encountered your mother, Shiki.

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:49.826 position:50% align:center
I've told you everything
up to this point before.

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.286 position:50% align:center
But from here on out,

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:53.913 position:50% align:center
there are a few things
that I've kept from you.

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:55.206 position:50% align:center
[gulps]

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.293 position:50% align:center
Let's give 'em space.

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.837 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Huh...? Oh.

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:05.550 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Man. I hope he's all right.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:10.555 position:50% align:center
I think he's gonna be fine.
He looked prepared for anything.

00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:11.723 position:50% align:center
I guess...

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:13.475 position:50% align:center
Uh? Shiki!

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:16.936 position:50% align:center
How come you guys are the
only ones who get ice cream?

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.188 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
I want some.

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:21.441 position:50% align:center
How did it go? You learn
much about your parents?

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:24.736 position:50% align:center
Oh. Right.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:27.572 position:50% align:center
It was, you know...

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:30.116 position:50% align:center
They're dead. Both of them.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.701 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA gasps]

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:34.829 position:50% align:center
But listen, you don't have to
get all depressed about it.

00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:37.374 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I had a
feeling they were.

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:40.710 position:50% align:center
So it wasn't really
some kinda big shocker.

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:42.462 position:50% align:center
What he told me was...

00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:46.049 position:50% align:center
[AKIO] Sadly, your dad
passed away while your mom

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.967 position:50% align:center
was still pregnant with you.

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:49.511 position:50% align:center
Then, when you
were five years old,

00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:53.264 position:50% align:center
your mom got sick and
passed on, as well.

00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:55.350 position:50% align:center
As for your trauma?

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:58.645 position:50% align:center
It's likely from seeing your
mom's dead body up close.

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:01.773 position:50% align:center
[AKIO]
I really am sorry.

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:03.942 position:50% align:center
I couldn't bring
myself to tell you.

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:09.489 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI] To be honest,
it's a huge relief!

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:11.908 position:50% align:center
It's like this weight
has been lifted.

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.410 position:50% align:center
Glad we came.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.036 position:50% align:center
So, thanks man.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.538 position:50% align:center
For bringing me.

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:20.959 position:50% align:center
I hope you can find
your parents someday!

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:22.252 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:25.005 position:50% align:center
Shiki. You're not
being yourself.

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:26.214 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:29.300 position:50% align:center
You're too cheerful.
It doesn't feel natural.

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:30.135 position:50% align:center
You're trying too hard--

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:31.636 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Shh!

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.389 position:50% align:center
You can't say that stuff out
loud, you gotta play along!

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:37.392 position:50% align:center
He's doing the best he can
to put on a brave face!

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.352 position:50% align:center

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:28.822 position:50% align:center
Yep. But she's been
badly injured.

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:31.157 position:50% align:center
We can't take her
to a human doctor,

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:34.035 position:50% align:center
so it's going to take her
some time to recover.

00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:37.622 position:50% align:center
The two of you will probably
have be apart for a while.

00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:40.667 position:50% align:center
But I promise I'll take
care of everything.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.669 position:50% align:center
Think you can settle for me?

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:44.963 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI sniffs]
Yeah!

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:47.424 position:50% align:center
I can deal with
whatever I have to!

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:51.011 position:50% align:center
But please, please
just save Mommy!

00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:53.722 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I swear.

00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:55.932 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
I kept asking for her...

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:57.767 position:50% align:center
Is my Mommy okay yet?

00:16:57.851 --> 00:17:00.603 position:50% align:center
[AKIO]
It might be a bit longer.

00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:02.689 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
Is Mommy feeling better now?

00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:04.566 position:50% align:center
No, not yet.

00:17:04.649 --> 00:17:05.775 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
How 'bout today?

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:09.237 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI] ...until at
one point, I stopped.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.366 position:50% align:center
For some reason, my gut told me
my Uncle wasn't being honest.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:15.368 position:50% align:center
But I didn't ever pry.

00:17:15.452 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
Once I realized I might
not like the answer,

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:20.540 position:50% align:center
I got too scared to ask.

00:17:20.623 --> 00:17:24.044 position:50% align:center
I turned away instead
of facing the truth.

00:17:24.127 --> 00:17:25.712 position:50% align:center
They're dead, or they've
abandoned us

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:28.048 position:50% align:center
and ditched responsibility.

00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:29.883 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
How could I have thought that.

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:32.260 position:50% align:center
There's no way Mom would
have abandoned me!

00:17:32.344 --> 00:17:34.929 position:50% align:center
I should have trusted her and
questioned everything else

00:17:35.013 --> 00:17:36.264 position:50% align:center
I was told!

00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:38.183 position:50% align:center
But instead...

00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:39.559 position:50% align:center
...I...!

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:44.314 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
Nobimaru, right?

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:45.523 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:47.359 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI] I'm not sure
how much I trust you,

00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:49.652 position:50% align:center
but I'd like to
trade information.

00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:51.446 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you what I know.

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:53.323 position:50% align:center
So, talk to me.

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:55.075 position:50% align:center
That's a fine arrangement.

00:17:55.158 --> 00:17:59.371 position:50% align:center
Let's see. We discovered
the case about a year ago.

00:17:59.454 --> 00:18:01.915 position:50% align:center
Apparently, Lady Inari
intended to dispose of

00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:03.750 position:50% align:center
Tademaru immediately.

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:05.710 position:50% align:center
For some reason
Inugami intervened.

00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:09.339 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI gasps]
That lines up...

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:10.924 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:18:11.007 --> 00:18:14.052 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI] I lived together with
my uncle for a pretty long time.

00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:17.138 position:50% align:center
So, in my heart, I don't
want to believe it.

00:18:17.222 --> 00:18:19.516 position:50% align:center
But if all of this is connected,

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:23.144 position:50% align:center
if it all ends up being
the truth... then...

00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:27.232 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
...I will make him pay!

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:29.693 position:50% align:center
Then you're planning
to commit homicide?

00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:32.362 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
That's right. Gonna stop me?

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:33.238 position:50% align:center
Nu-uh.

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:34.948 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI gasps]
Now, look.

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:37.409 position:50% align:center
You do understand that killing
someone is generally considered 

00:18:37.492 --> 00:18:39.703 position:50% align:center
to be a really bad
thing to do, doncha?

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:43.206 position:50% align:center
But that's the choice you've
decided to make, so...

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:45.333 position:50% align:center
...can I do anything
to help you?

00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:48.044 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:51.214 position:50% align:center
Ha! You're asking to be
involved in murder?

00:18:51.297 --> 00:18:52.632 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's fine.

00:18:52.716 --> 00:18:55.343 position:50% align:center
I've taken the lives of living
creatures lots of times.

00:18:55.427 --> 00:18:58.179 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI] We're not talking about
cockroaches and junk, dude!

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:01.975 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI grunts]

00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:05.270 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
Well, thanks.

00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:07.230 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
You're welcome.

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:09.607 position:50% align:center
Aww. Heartfelt friendship.

00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:11.985 position:50% align:center
It makes me want
to mess it all up.

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:15.196 position:50% align:center
[KABANE] Akira might be
against it, though, I guess.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.824 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI] Now that you mention it,
where is he?

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.077 position:50% align:center
[AKIO] Wow, it's been about
a year since the two of us

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:23.079 position:50% align:center
have spoken
like this, hasn't it?

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:27.334 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI] Time sure flies.
You in Kinshigo often?

00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:29.669 position:50% align:center
Once in a while,
for field work.

00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:34.341 position:50% align:center
But, coming here always brings
back so many memories.

00:19:34.424 --> 00:19:37.635 position:50% align:center
About Shiki... and my brother.

00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:40.472 position:50% align:center
And of course
Shiki's mother, Kumi.

00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:43.099 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI] Don't forget the
golden spider webbing.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.687 position:50% align:center
It's my understanding you
jumped through lots of hoops

00:19:47.771 --> 00:19:49.981 position:50% align:center
to try and sell it.

00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:52.359 position:50% align:center
But you were never able to.

00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:55.987 position:50% align:center
Some mysterious force
kept you from doing so.

00:19:56.071 --> 00:19:57.739 position:50% align:center
That sound about right?

00:19:57.822 --> 00:20:00.116 position:50% align:center
Wait, was that you, Inugami?

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.118 position:50% align:center
Were you the one who's
been hampering my work

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:03.787 position:50% align:center
this entire time?

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.790 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Wow, you sure owned up fast.

00:20:06.873 --> 00:20:08.041 position:50% align:center
Wasn't me, though.

00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:10.627 position:50% align:center
But I am acquainted with
the woman who did.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.504 position:50% align:center
[AKIO]
But why? I don't get it!

00:20:12.587 --> 00:20:16.091 position:50% align:center
You must understand how
wondrous that silk is!

00:20:16.174 --> 00:20:19.260 position:50% align:center
So... why?

00:20:19.344 --> 00:20:21.346 position:50% align:center
There it is.

00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:24.974 position:50% align:center
You don't even consider what
you did to be wrong, do you?

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:27.143 position:50% align:center
That's why you're
so open about it.

00:20:27.227 --> 00:20:30.146 position:50% align:center
Of course not!
Why the hell should I?

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:33.024 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Then by all means, enlighten me.

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:35.694 position:50% align:center
This forbidden golden webbing.

00:20:35.777 --> 00:20:37.654 position:50% align:center
Tell me how it came to be.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.950 position:50% align:center
[AKIO]
After meeting Kumi,

00:20:42.033 --> 00:20:44.619 position:50% align:center
and learning about the
existence of kemono,

00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:49.124 position:50% align:center
my brother and I arrived at
exactly the same conclusion.

00:20:49.207 --> 00:20:52.544 position:50% align:center
That the Legend of
Nishikigumo was true.

00:20:52.627 --> 00:20:55.422 position:50% align:center
And their real identity was
that of the spider kemono,

00:20:55.505 --> 00:20:57.173 position:50% align:center
the Arachnes.

00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:59.759 position:50% align:center
That discovery satiated
my brother's curiosity

00:20:59.843 --> 00:21:03.263 position:50% align:center
of the matter, however,
I still yearned for more.

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:06.016 position:50% align:center
Then of course, he had that
tragic accident in the woods

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:09.019 position:50% align:center
where he lost his footing
and fell to his death.

00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:11.604 position:50% align:center
Kumi mourned him terribly.

00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:12.897 position:50% align:center
But by that time,

00:21:12.981 --> 00:21:15.692 position:50% align:center
she was already pretty
far along with Shiki.

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:21.239 position:50% align:center
[AKIO]
Some while later,

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:24.534 position:50% align:center
Kumi showed up at my apartment
with the baby in tow.

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:27.746 position:50% align:center
Poor Shiki had come
down with influenza.

00:21:27.829 --> 00:21:30.540 position:50% align:center
There are effective drugs
for that in human society,

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:33.001 position:50% align:center
but none in the
kemono world.

00:21:33.084 --> 00:21:36.963 position:50% align:center
I took him to the hospital,
and told them he was a relative.

00:21:37.047 --> 00:21:39.799 position:50% align:center
After that, Kumi seemed to
decide it was best for Shiki

00:21:39.883 --> 00:21:42.302 position:50% align:center
if she were to raise
him as a human.

00:21:42.385 --> 00:21:44.721 position:50% align:center
But as a kemono,
she couldn't do it.

00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:49.601 position:50% align:center
[AKIO] Which is why I
made her a proposal.

00:21:49.684 --> 00:21:51.644 position:50% align:center
A way for her to turn
her Arachne powers

00:21:51.728 --> 00:21:53.855 position:50% align:center
into some good money.

00:21:53.938 --> 00:21:56.775 position:50% align:center
I explained that by doing so,
they could live without

00:21:56.858 --> 00:21:59.235 position:50% align:center
a want in the world
for the rest of their lives.

00:21:59.319 --> 00:22:02.906 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Akio, I really
appreciate this.

00:22:02.989 --> 00:22:05.658 position:50% align:center
And Kumi was happy to
cooperate with me.

00:22:05.742 --> 00:22:09.871 position:50% align:center
[KUMI] There's nothing I won't
do for this sweet boy of mine.

00:22:12.374 --> 00:22:14.459 position:50% align:center
[AKIO] The golden-web-producing
spider from the legend

00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:18.088 position:50% align:center
sounded like a kemono who
had been born a mutant,

00:22:18.171 --> 00:22:22.384 position:50% align:center
so the two of us decided to
try to make one artificially.

00:22:22.467 --> 00:22:26.012 position:50% align:center
Luckily, the forest here is full
of both creatures and kemono.

00:22:26.096 --> 00:22:28.723 position:50% align:center
So, using Kumi as
the maternal base,

00:22:28.807 --> 00:22:32.352 position:50% align:center
I tried every combination,
day in and day out.

00:22:32.435 --> 00:22:34.104 position:50% align:center
Sometime in the
course of all this,

00:22:34.187 --> 00:22:37.691 position:50% align:center
Shiki saw our test site,
and was pretty traumatized.

00:22:37.774 --> 00:22:39.275 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
And what did you do?

00:22:39.359 --> 00:22:41.319 position:50% align:center
[AKIO] I came up with
excuse after excuse

00:22:41.403 --> 00:22:43.405 position:50% align:center
to distance them
from each other.

00:22:43.488 --> 00:22:45.573 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, his memories
were all jumbled up,

00:22:45.657 --> 00:22:47.784 position:50% align:center
since he was so young.

00:22:47.867 --> 00:22:50.286 position:50% align:center
[AKIO] Man, that was
such a rough time.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.914 position:50% align:center
Kumi was on the verge
of breaking down, too.

00:22:54.708 --> 00:22:57.127 position:50% align:center
[AKIO] But... in the
face of many failures,

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:59.587 position:50% align:center
I kept pushing
onwards and finally,

00:22:59.671 --> 00:23:01.715 position:50% align:center
we achieved our
greatest miracle!

00:23:01.798 --> 00:23:05.677 position:50% align:center
Our beautiful, golden
spider webbing was born!

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.888 position:50% align:center
Stabilizing the production to
perfection of course took time,

00:23:08.972 --> 00:23:11.016 position:50% align:center
but our efforts bore fruit!

00:23:11.099 --> 00:23:13.852 position:50% align:center
This silk would eliminate the
words "illness" and "injury"

00:23:13.935 --> 00:23:15.061 position:50% align:center
from the world.

00:23:15.145 --> 00:23:18.023 position:50% align:center
Mankind was one step
closer to immortality!

00:23:18.106 --> 00:23:20.650 position:50% align:center
And I'd become the
most prolific man

00:23:20.734 --> 00:23:22.736 position:50% align:center
to have ever walked this earth!

00:23:25.113 --> 00:23:26.573 position:50% align:center
Well, there you have it.

00:23:26.656 --> 00:23:29.242 position:50% align:center
What now, Shiki?

00:23:31.494 --> 00:23:34.998 position:50% align:center
[AKIO grunts, gags]

00:23:35.081 --> 00:23:38.168 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI] I haven't forgotten how
you took care of me or anything.

00:23:38.251 --> 00:23:39.127 position:50% align:center
Thanks for that.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.420 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:23:43.048 --> 00:23:45.842 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure that you don't
suffer when I kill you.
