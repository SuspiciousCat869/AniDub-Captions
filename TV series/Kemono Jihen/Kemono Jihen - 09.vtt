[OHANA-BASAN]
Hm...

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.646 position:50% align:center
Wha'cha think, Doc?

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:23.690 position:50% align:center
I believe it's most
likely psychological.

00:00:23.774 --> 00:00:26.401 position:50% align:center
This one's been through
quite an ordeal.

00:00:26.485 --> 00:00:29.404 position:50% align:center
I've seen plenty
of patients like this.

00:00:29.488 --> 00:00:31.406 position:50% align:center
She's gonna wake up,
though, right?

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.035 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I'll brew her up a
nice analeptic herbal treatment.

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:37.079 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:40.791 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA] Um, excuse me,
but are you a kemono?

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.417 position:50% align:center
[OHANA-BASAN]
I'm obviously human.

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:43.919 position:50% align:center
Are you always this rude?

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.922 position:50% align:center
Ohana actually started
out as a veterinarian.

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:48.590 position:50% align:center
However, somewhere
along the way,

00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:51.009 position:50% align:center
while treating wounded
stray dogs and such,

00:00:51.093 --> 00:00:54.680 position:50% align:center
she found herself caring for
a fair number of kemono, too.

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:56.723 position:50% align:center
[OHANA-BASAN] I believe
every life is valuable,

00:00:56.807 --> 00:00:58.851 position:50% align:center
no matter what kind it might be.

00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:00.394 position:50% align:center
You've all been through a lot.

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.813 position:50% align:center
I can see that you're
completely exhausted.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:05.357 position:50% align:center
We have some vacant beds,
so why don't you stay the night?

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.943 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA] Oh, thank you!
Think I could take a bath?

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:09.778 position:50% align:center
[OHANA-BASAN]
I'll get some hot water going.

00:01:09.862 --> 00:01:12.489 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA giggles]
Yes!

00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:22.541 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.073 position:50% align:center
[AYA] I don't have any
right to open this door.

00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:24.204 position:50% align:center
[AYA] My first job
in life was to mend

00:03:24.288 --> 00:03:27.332 position:50% align:center
my terribly injured mother.

00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:30.836 position:50% align:center
I'd had the power of my healing
silk ever since I was born.

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.007 position:50% align:center
But it wasn't until I was three
that I gained any control of it.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.052 position:50% align:center
He always treated me
like a "thing", a tool.

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:40.596 position:50% align:center
If I didn't do as he said,

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:44.057 position:50% align:center
he'd hit me the way you'd
hit a broken machine.

00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:46.977 position:50% align:center
Luckily, he couldn't really
afford to break me,

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.522 position:50% align:center
so I still managed to get
my way from time to time.

00:03:50.606 --> 00:03:55.027 position:50% align:center
The entirety of my life was in
the basement of his apartment.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.321 position:50% align:center
There, I had the books
I'd begged him for,

00:03:57.404 --> 00:04:00.157 position:50% align:center
the girly clothes
he chose for me,

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.159 position:50% align:center
and of course...

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.369 position:50% align:center
...my sleeping mother.

00:04:04.453 --> 00:04:07.623 position:50% align:center
I barely remember my
mother ever being awake.

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:11.210 position:50% align:center
I would gaze at her face every
day, and when I got lonely,

00:04:11.293 --> 00:04:13.754 position:50% align:center
I would curl up by her side.

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:16.298 position:50% align:center
There were times I
wished I was dead,

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:18.926 position:50% align:center
but I liked the name
my mother gave me,

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.428 position:50% align:center
so I chose not to die.

00:04:21.512 --> 00:04:25.599 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzes]

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:30.437 position:50% align:center
[AYA] Then one day, I discovered
that I had a big brother.

00:04:32.314 --> 00:04:34.483 position:50% align:center
[AKIO]
Hey, Shiki! It's been a while.

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:35.317 position:50% align:center
How have you been?

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.110 position:50% align:center
[AYA]
A big brother...

00:04:37.194 --> 00:04:40.864 position:50% align:center
I knew it was silly, but I found
myself picturing his face,

00:04:40.948 --> 00:04:42.491 position:50% align:center
which I'd never seen,

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:46.203 position:50% align:center
as the Prince Charming
from one of my books.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:49.790 position:50% align:center
I believed once Mom was
all better and woke up again,

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
we'd run away together,
hand in hand.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.670 position:50% align:center
And when we did,

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:58.257 position:50% align:center
I was sure my big brother would
know and come to rescue us.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.593 position:50% align:center
But that was all
another fairy tale.

00:05:01.677 --> 00:05:05.389 position:50% align:center
In the end, I was the one
who ruined both of them.

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:10.686 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
I know you're out there.

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:11.979 position:50% align:center
[AYA gasps]

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:14.982 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
Come in. I bet you're worried.

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:17.234 position:50% align:center
You've been looking
for her all this time.

00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:23.866 position:50% align:center
[AYA sighs]

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.998 position:50% align:center
Don't you hate me, though?

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:34.126 position:50% align:center
I know I would, because I'm...

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:35.711 position:50% align:center
I'm a stain that
should be cleansed,

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:37.796 position:50% align:center
like the others you guys killed.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.465 position:50% align:center
The only difference is
I look human and I can

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:43.552 position:50% align:center
speak the language instead of
repeating what Mom said.

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:45.345 position:50% align:center
So why won't you kill me?

00:05:45.429 --> 00:05:46.889 position:50% align:center
Is it because I look
like a little girl,

00:05:46.972 --> 00:05:48.765 position:50% align:center
so you can't bring yourself
to do it, or is it about--

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.518 position:50% align:center
You're the only reason that
our mother's still alive.

00:05:51.602 --> 00:05:52.895 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:56.064 position:50% align:center
I haven't helped at all.
Not when compared to you.

00:05:56.148 --> 00:05:58.275 position:50% align:center
What you've sacrificed.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:01.236 position:50% align:center
You were stuck there,
fighting your own battle alone.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.238 position:50% align:center
And I was blissfully unaware.

00:06:03.322 --> 00:06:06.116 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I avoided
it all together.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.076 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to have met you.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.997 position:50% align:center
And I'm grateful that you
saved her so, you don't...

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.625 position:50% align:center
You don't have to keep
yourself at arm's length.

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:16.293 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and hold her hand.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:19.922 position:50% align:center
I mean, the old lady did say
it was a psychological thing.

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:22.007 position:50% align:center
And she's your
mom too, isn't she?

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.134 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:26.428 position:50% align:center
So, just to be clear,
are you saying it really

00:06:26.512 --> 00:06:28.805 position:50% align:center
doesn't bother you if I
keep calling her "Mom"?

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.057 position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.808 position:50% align:center
Oh, okay.

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:33.101 position:50% align:center
In that case,

00:06:33.185 --> 00:06:34.728 position:50% align:center
do you think I could call
you Big Brother, then?

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.563 position:50% align:center
Wait... What?

00:06:36.647 --> 00:06:39.858 position:50% align:center
Uh! I, uh... I...

00:06:39.942 --> 00:06:42.069 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI, AYA gasp]

00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:45.948 position:50% align:center
Shiki... Aya...

00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:47.824 position:50% align:center
You really woke up.

00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:50.702 position:50% align:center
Do you actually... remember me?

00:06:50.786 --> 00:06:52.162 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:06:52.246 --> 00:06:55.457 position:50% align:center
Look at you two!
You've grown so much.

00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:57.292 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad you're all right.

00:06:57.376 --> 00:06:58.669 position:50% align:center
Mom!

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:03.757 position:50% align:center
[AYA sobs]

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:28.115 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI sighs]
Good enough.

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:30.117 position:50% align:center
Yo! Food time, kids!

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.368 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Get in my tummy!

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:32.828 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Thank you.

00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:35.706 position:50% align:center
Heads up guys, we just
had a new job come in.

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:37.374 position:50% align:center
I have some business
to take care of,

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:39.793 position:50% align:center
so it'd be great if you two
could handle it for me.

00:07:39.877 --> 00:07:42.087 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Hm? Just Kabane and me?

00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:44.464 position:50% align:center
Sure thing. When do we start?

00:07:44.548 --> 00:07:48.635 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA] Hm. Hard to believe
it's been a whole week.

00:07:49.887 --> 00:07:52.472 position:50% align:center
So, um. I'm gonna
stay here for a bit.

00:07:52.556 --> 00:07:53.807 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:56.018 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI] Mom still isn't
back at a hundred percent.

00:07:56.101 --> 00:08:00.480 position:50% align:center
I have a family. And that means
I need rethink some stuff.

00:08:00.564 --> 00:08:02.649 position:50% align:center
Like, there's no freakin'
way we could get by

00:08:02.733 --> 00:08:04.651 position:50% align:center
on what sorta money
I'm making right now.

00:08:04.735 --> 00:08:07.821 position:50% align:center
Wait, what? You can't seriously
quit being a Kemonoist!

00:08:07.905 --> 00:08:09.364 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:08:09.448 --> 00:08:11.783 position:50% align:center
How about you all live with
us at the office. I'll share!

00:08:11.867 --> 00:08:15.621 position:50% align:center
Pump the brakes, I'm not
running a hotel, ya know.

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:18.999 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA] It's kind of boring
around here without Shiki.

00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:21.793 position:50% align:center
[KABANE] Do you think he'll
ever come back again?

00:08:21.877 --> 00:08:25.088 position:50% align:center
Who can say? But this is
good for him, you guys.

00:08:25.172 --> 00:08:27.758 position:50% align:center
He has something more
important than work.

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:29.635 position:50% align:center
Are you two missin' him?

00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:30.886 position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:32.971 position:50% align:center
It's great he's spending
time with his family.

00:08:33.055 --> 00:08:35.140 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI] You smile when
you lie, you know that?

00:08:35.224 --> 00:08:37.017 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
It's a little creepy.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.353 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI] Think you can
get rid of me that easy?

00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:40.646 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Shiki!

00:08:41.605 --> 00:08:43.148 position:50% align:center
You mean you aren't quitting?

00:08:43.232 --> 00:08:45.400 position:50% align:center
I never said I was,
you assumed that.

00:08:45.484 --> 00:08:47.402 position:50% align:center
Things just
settled down, is all.

00:08:47.486 --> 00:08:49.613 position:50% align:center
Oh, they did? That's great.

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:52.324 position:50% align:center
Told you, man.
I gotta pay you back.

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:54.451 position:50% align:center
Until we can track
down your parents,

00:08:54.535 --> 00:08:56.662 position:50% align:center
I'd die before I ditch this gig.

00:08:57.913 --> 00:08:59.414 position:50% align:center
Good plan.

00:08:59.498 --> 00:09:00.916 position:50% align:center
Woo-hoo! Nice!

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:02.626 position:50% align:center
[AYA]
Are you guys finished yet?

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:06.839 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA gasps]
Aya?

00:09:06.922 --> 00:09:08.632 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I changed my look up.

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:10.801 position:50% align:center
Tademaru used to
pick out my clothes,

00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:12.344 position:50% align:center
and they weren't my style.

00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:13.762 position:50% align:center
Mom's going out today,

00:09:13.846 --> 00:09:17.808 position:50% align:center
so she asked me to keep
an eye on Aya for her.

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:20.435 position:50% align:center
Wow, so this is where
you work, Big Brother?

00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:21.562 position:50% align:center
Adorable!

00:09:21.645 --> 00:09:23.063 position:50% align:center
Would you shut up?

00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:26.275 position:50% align:center
It's not too bad. I mean,
it reeks of cigarettes and boys,

00:09:26.358 --> 00:09:28.443 position:50% align:center
but it's actually
surprisingly tidy.

00:09:28.527 --> 00:09:29.903 position:50% align:center
That's what I aimed for.

00:09:29.987 --> 00:09:32.781 position:50% align:center
I'm here to report in and
take care of some business.

00:09:32.865 --> 00:09:36.326 position:50% align:center
Guess what? I've decided to work
alongside Granny at her clinic.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:37.703 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:40.581 position:50% align:center
[AYA] Yep! I'm gonna put the
power of my healing silk

00:16:09.511 --> 00:16:11.555 position:50% align:center
Just be quiet and
leave me alone!

00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:14.266 position:50% align:center
I'm all messed up inside!

00:16:14.349 --> 00:16:16.894 position:50% align:center
My chest is mushy,
and my head's spinning!

00:16:16.977 --> 00:16:19.479 position:50% align:center
It's always so much fun
being with Kabane.

00:16:19.563 --> 00:16:21.607 position:50% align:center
But today, it's the
total opposite!

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:22.566 position:50% align:center
Kon...

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:24.818 position:50% align:center

It's all your fault.

--Uh...
--[KON] I'll devour you!

[KABANE]
Stop!

00:16:31.366 --> 00:16:32.618 position:50% align:center
Aya, you all right?

00:16:32.701 --> 00:16:34.411 position:50% align:center
[AYA]
Me?! Look at your arm!

00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:36.663 position:50% align:center
Oh. Don't worry, I'm fine.

00:16:36.747 --> 00:16:38.874 position:50% align:center
Kon, you can't hurt Aya, 'kay?

00:16:38.957 --> 00:16:41.084 position:50% align:center
If you have to
eat someone, eat me.

[AYA whimpers]

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.220 position:50% align:center
[KATANASHI] How cruel!
Look, you made her cry!

00:16:51.303 --> 00:16:53.263 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, who's the cruel one?

00:16:53.347 --> 00:16:56.183 position:50% align:center
--I literally almost got eaten!
--She left.

00:16:56.266 --> 00:16:57.309 position:50% align:center

We're back!

00:16:57.392 --> 00:16:58.435 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
You're alive!

00:16:58.519 --> 00:16:59.728 position:50% align:center
Cool, cool, cool.
Anything broken?

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:01.021 position:50% align:center
'Course not!

00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:02.606 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
And the job?

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:04.316 position:50% align:center
It's all wrapped up!

00:17:04.399 --> 00:17:06.193 position:50% align:center
She said she was doing it
because she wanted to

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:09.696 position:50% align:center
look human, so I made her look
human, at least on the outside.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.156 position:50% align:center
In exchange,
she gave us her word

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.367 position:50% align:center
that she wouldn't attack
people anymore.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.954 position:50% align:center
Aya handled it all by herself.
I didn't have to do anything.

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:18.539 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
For real?!

00:17:18.622 --> 00:17:22.125 position:50% align:center
Well, I was only able to because
Kabane here was protecting me.

00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:23.710 position:50% align:center
Yikes, what do we do now?

00:17:23.794 --> 00:17:26.338 position:50% align:center
Her first gig and she's
already better at it than us.

00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:28.924 position:50% align:center
All-righty then, I probably
should get going now.

00:17:29.007 --> 00:17:31.552 position:50% align:center
Bye, Kabane, don't you
two time me. Muah!

00:17:31.635 --> 00:17:33.428 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI, AKIRA scream]

00:17:33.512 --> 00:17:35.764 position:50% align:center
How... could... you?!

00:17:35.848 --> 00:17:37.516 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Are you
saying if Kabane

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:39.184 position:50% align:center
and I got married,
then you'd disapprove?

00:17:39.268 --> 00:17:41.061 position:50% align:center
M-M-Married?

00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:41.979 position:50% align:center

Hmph.

[AYA hums]

00:17:43.397 --> 00:17:45.524 position:50% align:center

Wait! I'll walk you out!

[KABANE]
Kon! Are you here?

00:17:51.446 --> 00:17:52.406 position:50% align:center
[KON]
No!

00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:53.991 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
You're here.

00:17:54.074 --> 00:17:55.367 position:50% align:center
Is something up?

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.453 position:50% align:center
You've been acting different
than usual all day.

00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:06.962 position:50% align:center
[KON grunts]

00:18:09.006 --> 00:18:11.049 position:50% align:center

Hey! Are you all ri--

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.179 position:50% align:center
Oh! Um...

00:18:16.847 --> 00:18:19.516 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
No, wait! Let's talk!

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.311 position:50% align:center
[KON sniffs]
What's the use?

00:18:22.394 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
I bet you hate
me now, don't you?

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:25.981 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Why?

00:18:26.064 --> 00:18:27.524 position:50% align:center
Because...

00:18:27.608 --> 00:18:30.819 position:50% align:center
I tried to eat that bug-smelling
girl right in front of you.

00:18:30.903 --> 00:18:35.032 position:50% align:center
Be honest with me. She's your
number-one, isn't she?

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:36.575 position:50% align:center
You mean Aya?

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:39.077 position:50% align:center
She's just Shiki's
little sister.

00:18:39.161 --> 00:18:41.830 position:50% align:center
So I had to protect
her from being eaten.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.667 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Did you end up getting hurt?

00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:47.794 position:50% align:center
You're all dirty.

00:18:47.878 --> 00:18:51.632 position:50% align:center
No, it's nothing. I got scraped
when I fell out of the tree.

00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:54.843 position:50% align:center
[KON gasps]

00:18:54.927 --> 00:18:57.804 position:50% align:center
It's gone! My chest
mushiness is all gone!

00:18:57.888 --> 00:18:59.681 position:50% align:center
Oh, you were just sick, then?

00:18:59.765 --> 00:19:02.059 position:50% align:center
Glad it wasn't something
more serious.

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:05.020 position:50% align:center
[KON] Yeah. I didn't know
what was happening.

00:19:05.103 --> 00:19:07.272 position:50% align:center
I thought I was dying.

00:19:07.356 --> 00:19:08.440 position:50% align:center
I get it.

00:19:08.524 --> 00:19:10.192 position:50% align:center
When you were crying before,

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:12.402 position:50% align:center
I didn't know what
was going on, either.

00:19:12.486 --> 00:19:14.696 position:50% align:center
[KON]
Whenever that happens, do this.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.532 position:50% align:center
Sounds good to me.

00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:23.205 position:50% align:center
That kemono talked about...
being some guy's number-one.

00:19:23.288 --> 00:19:24.748 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:28.836 position:50% align:center
I've worked all this time to
become Lady Inari's number-one.

00:19:28.919 --> 00:19:32.965 position:50% align:center
But right now, I want to
be your number-one, too.

00:19:33.048 --> 00:19:35.843 position:50% align:center
How do I do that?

00:19:35.926 --> 00:19:37.636 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Be my number-one?

00:19:42.057 --> 00:19:45.435 position:50% align:center
Well... I don't know.

00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:47.688 position:50% align:center
[KON]
Oh... That's too bad.

00:19:47.771 --> 00:19:49.731 position:50% align:center
When you find out,
be sure to tell me.

00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:59.783 position:50% align:center
I honestly don't know how
to thank you, Inugami.

00:19:59.867 --> 00:20:02.077 position:50% align:center
I truly appreciate
you doing this for me.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.873 position:50% align:center
Ah, think nothing of it,
this was a simple request.

00:20:05.956 --> 00:20:08.709 position:50% align:center
I may have been misled
by Akio's ambitions,

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:10.961 position:50% align:center
but that doesn't change
the fact that I gave birth

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:12.880 position:50% align:center
to those children.

00:20:12.963 --> 00:20:16.049 position:50% align:center
I wanted to memorialize them.

00:20:16.133 --> 00:20:17.759 position:50% align:center
Did you tell the other two?

00:20:17.843 --> 00:20:22.097 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI] Nope, not a word.
Discretion is our specialty.

00:20:22.181 --> 00:20:24.016 position:50% align:center
Thank you again, I mean it.

00:20:24.099 --> 00:20:26.894 position:50% align:center
If they found out,
it'd only upset them.

00:20:26.977 --> 00:20:29.146 position:50% align:center
I know the woman who is
taking care of things

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:31.148 position:50% align:center
and she tends to be
extremely thorough.

00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:33.358 position:50% align:center
So I get the feeling that
the rest of your children

00:20:33.442 --> 00:20:35.944 position:50% align:center
who lived here have
already been disposed of.

00:20:36.028 --> 00:20:37.738 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see.

00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:40.282 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
You have every right to be sad.

00:20:40.365 --> 00:20:42.826 position:50% align:center
Our pals worked hard so
you could smile again.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:45.495 position:50% align:center
I know it's tough,
but it will get easier.

00:20:45.579 --> 00:20:47.372 position:50% align:center
Now you can make
some new memories,

00:20:47.456 --> 00:20:50.751 position:50% align:center
do a little catching up
with Shiki and Aya.

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:52.252 position:50% align:center
And you know where to find me.

00:20:52.336 --> 00:20:54.755 position:50% align:center
Holler if you ever
wanna pay your respects.

00:20:56.298 --> 00:20:58.050 position:50% align:center
[KUMI]
I will.

00:20:58.133 --> 00:20:59.593 position:50% align:center
Hello, everyone!

00:20:59.676 --> 00:21:02.513 position:50% align:center
No! You had one job
and you finished it!

00:21:02.596 --> 00:21:04.181 position:50% align:center
So what are you doing back here?

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:06.683 position:50% align:center
What's the big deal,
it's not like you're busy.

00:21:06.767 --> 00:21:08.894 position:50% align:center
Besides, I'm not here
to see you, silly!

00:21:08.977 --> 00:21:11.063 position:50% align:center
--I'm here for my boyfriend!
--[SHIKI] Boyfriend?

00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:12.564 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right, darling?

00:21:12.648 --> 00:21:14.399 position:50% align:center
Where do you wanna go today?

00:21:14.483 --> 00:21:17.236 position:50% align:center
Kabane, the weather's nice.
Come outside and fight me--

00:21:18.153 --> 00:21:19.696 position:50% align:center
Well, if it isn't the
little bug-girl!

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.658 position:50% align:center
Huh? Who you calling
bug-girl, ya old shrew?

00:21:22.741 --> 00:21:25.536 position:50% align:center
You still haven't even
apologized to me for last time,

00:21:25.619 --> 00:21:26.995 position:50% align:center
--not that I'm surprised!
--[KABANE] Please stop.

00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:29.498 position:50% align:center
Holy smokes, our Kabane
is a ladies man.

00:21:29.581 --> 00:21:32.584 position:50% align:center
If they married...
Kabane would be my brother.

00:21:32.668 --> 00:21:34.253 position:50% align:center
That's just too much.

00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:36.672 position:50% align:center
You can't leave them both
hanging like this, Kabane!

00:21:36.755 --> 00:21:38.298 position:50% align:center
Which one do you choose?

00:21:38.382 --> 00:21:39.675 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:21:39.758 --> 00:21:42.052 position:50% align:center
I mean that you can
only have one lover.

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:43.512 position:50% align:center
I know it's hard,

00:21:43.595 --> 00:21:45.472 position:50% align:center
but you have to step up and
make some kind of choice!

00:21:45.556 --> 00:21:48.058 position:50% align:center
A lover...? Hold on.

00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:49.893 position:50% align:center
You mean a boyfriend
or girlfriend is someone

00:21:49.977 --> 00:21:51.436 position:50% align:center
you're supposed to love?

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.521 position:50% align:center
Then I know who it is.

00:21:52.604 --> 00:21:53.355 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:56.108 position:50% align:center
Well don't keep us waiting!

00:21:56.191 --> 00:21:58.485 position:50% align:center
It's Inugami.

00:21:58.569 --> 00:22:00.904 position:50% align:center
What?! Do you really
go for older men?

00:22:00.988 --> 00:22:03.198 position:50% align:center
I had no clue that
was your type!

00:22:04.199 --> 00:22:06.869 position:50% align:center
Woah! Whatever this is,
count me out.

00:22:06.952 --> 00:22:09.121 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA] I think that
job with the cat man

00:22:09.204 --> 00:22:11.874 position:50% align:center
may have left Kabane
seriously messed up.

00:22:11.957 --> 00:22:13.292 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but I'm not
correcting him.

00:22:13.375 --> 00:22:14.459 position:50% align:center
Don't wanna touch that.

00:22:14.543 --> 00:22:16.420 position:50% align:center
Forget it.
