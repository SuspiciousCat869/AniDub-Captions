You know,

when I heard those things
speaking like my Mom,

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.041 position:50% align:center
I realized something.

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:10.712 position:50% align:center
Even if I kill my uncle,
it won't bring anyone back.

00:11:10.796 --> 00:11:13.257 position:50% align:center
Which should've
been super-obvious.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.093 position:50% align:center
Once that sank in,
that was kinda it.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:19.388 position:50% align:center
The strong urge to kill that
bastard just disappeared.

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:23.183 position:50% align:center
And then, in its place, was the
desire to see my mom again.

00:11:23.267 --> 00:11:25.519 position:50% align:center
And that crushed me.

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:27.813 position:50% align:center
So the only thing left
now is emptiness.

Aya! You shouldn't be here!

00:11:40.659 --> 00:11:42.703 position:50% align:center
I told you to stay away
from these woods!

Would you be quiet.
You're not getting out of this,

Don't just stand there, run!
Hurry and go!

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.839 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI] Why is he
freaking out so much?

00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:56.842 position:50% align:center
He's more worked up than when
he was about to be killed.

00:11:56.925 --> 00:12:00.512 position:50% align:center
You're a disgrace.
This is game over for you.

00:12:00.596 --> 00:12:03.473 position:50% align:center
But before you die,
tell me one thing.

00:12:03.557 --> 00:12:05.559 position:50% align:center
Where did you hide
the cocoon I made?

00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:07.686 position:50% align:center
Don't bother lying.

Heh.

00:12:09.313 --> 00:12:12.649 position:50% align:center
You know, for a minute there
I thought it was over for me.

00:12:12.733 --> 00:12:14.318 position:50% align:center
But until I give you
what you want,

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:16.195 position:50% align:center
I've still got some time left.

00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:26.246 position:50% align:center
As long as I have the cocoon,

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.749 position:50% align:center
you know very well that
you can't leave me.

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:30.250 position:50% align:center
And if I were to die,

00:12:30.334 --> 00:12:33.212 position:50% align:center
you would stand no chance of
finding it all on your own.

00:12:33.295 --> 00:12:35.380 position:50% align:center
What are you gonna
do about that, Aya?

[AYA grunts]

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.258 position:50% align:center

Excuse me, but what's your deal,
popping up out of nowhere?

00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:42.930 position:50% align:center
I'd like to hurry and
finish him off ASAP.

Go ahead, try and persuade them.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.524 position:50% align:center
Tell them not to kill me.

What matters isn't how
long you live on this rock.

behind when you go.

Right.

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:35.232 position:50% align:center

to Uncle has always been

leaving some kind of legacy.

00:13:37.401 --> 00:13:38.861 position:50% align:center
His work.

00:13:38.944 --> 00:13:41.196 position:50% align:center
That's why he didn't
flip out as much before,

when he was about to be killed.

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:45.784 position:50% align:center

left something behind.

valued over his own life.

[AYA]
Hey! Are you okay?

00:17:24.795 --> 00:17:26.547 position:50% align:center
What's a kemono doing in there?

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:28.632 position:50% align:center
Some kinda bodyguard,
I'm guessing.

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.467 position:50% align:center
He's thorough,
I'll sure give him that.

00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:33.428 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Were you able
to find the cocoon?

00:17:33.512 --> 00:17:35.848 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
Yeah, I did.

00:17:35.931 --> 00:17:38.141 position:50% align:center
Tell me, was that your doing?

00:17:38.225 --> 00:17:39.351 position:50% align:center
[AYA gasps]

00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:42.729 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI] I gotta know.
Is Mom still alive?

00:17:42.813 --> 00:17:45.107 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:46.608 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:17:47.818 --> 00:17:50.320 position:50% align:center
[AYA]
I should've told you right away.

00:17:50.404 --> 00:17:52.406 position:50% align:center
You deserve to know.

00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:55.492 position:50% align:center
My name is Tademaru Aya.

00:17:55.576 --> 00:17:59.079 position:50% align:center
And the golden webbing
is actually me!

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.125 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Shiki!

00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:05.711 position:50% align:center
Hang on, is that woman
who I think it is?

00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:06.837 position:50% align:center
Kumi...

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.213 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA gasps]

00:18:08.297 --> 00:18:11.091 position:50% align:center
Which means that Shiki's
mother isn't dead after all.

00:18:11.175 --> 00:18:14.094 position:50% align:center
It seems not. I mean,
if you think about it.

00:18:14.178 --> 00:18:16.180 position:50% align:center
Tademaru never had
any serious motivation

00:18:16.263 --> 00:18:18.265 position:50% align:center
to dispose of the woman.

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:21.101 position:50% align:center
She is the mother of his
precious golden webbing.

00:18:21.185 --> 00:18:22.644 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course.

00:18:22.728 --> 00:18:26.315 position:50% align:center
Not only was it important to
keep her alive to control Aya,

00:18:26.398 --> 00:18:29.985 position:50% align:center
but she was also insurance,
in case of emergency.

00:18:30.068 --> 00:18:31.570 position:50% align:center
Take a close look.

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:34.489 position:50% align:center
You'll notice she's not only
uninjured, but hasn't aged.

00:18:34.573 --> 00:18:36.950 position:50% align:center
Such is the power of
our golden webbing.

00:18:37.034 --> 00:18:39.119 position:50% align:center
Once Aya's silk was
fully established,

00:18:39.203 --> 00:18:41.288 position:50% align:center
Kumi could continue
to function as a base.

00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:43.582 position:50% align:center
Mass production was
just on the horizon.

00:18:43.665 --> 00:18:44.917 position:50% align:center
[AKIO grunts]

00:18:47.503 --> 00:18:50.797 position:50% align:center
I'm sick and tired of
hearing this crap from you.

00:18:50.881 --> 00:18:54.635 position:50% align:center
Don't ever treat us like
things again, you scumbag!

00:18:56.762 --> 00:19:00.766 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI] Inugami. I wanna
move Mom somewhere safe.

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:02.976 position:50% align:center
I hear ya, bud, and I
know just the place.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.937 position:50% align:center
Let's get her to the car, first.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.104 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
Okay.

00:19:06.188 --> 00:19:08.023 position:50% align:center
Are you sure about this?

00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:09.566 position:50% align:center
What?

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.069 position:50% align:center
[KABANE] You gave him a good
slug, but one hit isn't fatal.

00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:13.779 position:50% align:center
Your uncle is still alive.

00:19:13.862 --> 00:19:15.697 position:50% align:center
It's not like I'm letting
him off the hook.

00:19:15.781 --> 00:19:19.117 position:50% align:center
I'm wiping out everything that
he was hoping to leave behind.

00:19:19.201 --> 00:19:22.287 position:50% align:center
And if he tries to start over,
I'll shut him down.

00:19:22.371 --> 00:19:25.832 position:50% align:center
Plus, he's already got Inari
keeping an eye on him.

00:19:25.916 --> 00:19:28.877 position:50% align:center
I doubt there's
anything he could do.

00:19:28.961 --> 00:19:31.588 position:50% align:center
I used to live with the guy,
so I would know.

00:19:31.672 --> 00:19:34.007 position:50% align:center
Just having to go on like this.

00:19:34.091 --> 00:19:37.678 position:50% align:center
Unrecognized by anyone.
No grand legacy.

00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:41.682 position:50% align:center
That kind of thing is a fate
worse than death to my uncle.

00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:42.808 position:50% align:center
Shiki...

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:45.310 position:50% align:center
I see... Okay. Lemme help.

00:19:45.394 --> 00:19:47.813 position:50% align:center
Nah, it's nothing.
I can handle it fine.

00:19:47.896 --> 00:19:49.314 position:50% align:center
But your arms are shaking.

00:19:49.398 --> 00:19:50.691 position:50% align:center
Listen, Kabane.

00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:53.443 position:50% align:center
I think we should let
Shiki do this by himself.

00:19:53.527 --> 00:19:54.444 position:50% align:center
How come?

00:19:54.528 --> 00:19:55.821 position:50% align:center
Just one of those things.

00:19:55.904 --> 00:19:59.449 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Hm... Well, if you say so.

00:19:59.533 --> 00:20:01.577 position:50% align:center
Alrighty, short-stuff,
you're coming too.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.078 position:50% align:center
[AYA gasps]
But...

00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:05.998 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI] You're coming,
and that's final. No "buts!"

00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:06.999 position:50% align:center
[AYA]
I don't think...

00:20:07.082 --> 00:20:09.376 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
Just shut up.

00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:11.962 position:50% align:center
[AYA] Wait, hold on!
Gimme a sec!

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:13.922 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
Nope. Lets go.

00:20:19.178 --> 00:20:19.970 position:50% align:center
Um...

00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:22.097 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong, Kabane?

00:20:22.181 --> 00:20:24.516 position:50% align:center
Nobimaru musta slipped
away at some point.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.393 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Huh, guess you're right.

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:28.854 position:50% align:center
Maybe he's already
onto his next gig?

00:20:28.937 --> 00:20:30.981 position:50% align:center
Alrighty, squeeze on
in you two.

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:32.608 position:50% align:center
Headin' back to Tokyo.

00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:33.775 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Okey-doke.

00:20:33.859 --> 00:20:35.068 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
You got it.

00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:38.864 position:50% align:center
[pants]

00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:41.200 position:50% align:center
[AKIO] I'm not
giving up. Not yet.

00:20:41.283 --> 00:20:43.493 position:50% align:center
There are still a ton
of kemono out there.

00:20:43.577 --> 00:20:46.496 position:50% align:center
I just picked the
wrong partner, that's all!

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:47.998 position:50% align:center
[NOBIMARU]
Not quite.

00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:50.125 position:50% align:center
You were the problem,
not your partner.

00:20:50.209 --> 00:20:52.252 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I only let you
live out of goodwill

00:20:52.336 --> 00:20:55.672 position:50% align:center
in the first place. But please
don't get the wrong idea.

00:20:55.756 --> 00:20:57.966 position:50% align:center
Because the thing is,
once you've crossed a kitsune,

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:00.719 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid your fate
is already sealed.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:03.764 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:06.266 position:50% align:center

This was only a brief detour.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.227 position:50% align:center
Hope you enjoyed the ride.

00:21:16.401 --> 00:21:20.781 position:50% align:center
Hey Shiki. I'm glad that
your mother's still alive.

00:21:20.864 --> 00:21:22.366 position:50% align:center
I, uh...

00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:25.953 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
I am too.

00:21:31.124 --> 00:21:32.209 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI]
What's this?

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:34.378 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI] A clinic run
by someone I know.

00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:36.046 position:50% align:center
If your mom's
injuries are healed

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:39.550 position:50% align:center
but she still won't wake up,
there must be some reason.

00:21:39.633 --> 00:21:41.468 position:50% align:center
We'll have to
consult a specialist.

00:21:41.552 --> 00:21:43.387 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:21:44.596 --> 00:21:46.765 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA] This place is
giving me the creeps.

00:21:46.849 --> 00:21:49.101 position:50% align:center
Can I hold your hand, Kabane?

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:50.894 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Fine with me.

00:21:50.978 --> 00:21:54.314 position:50% align:center
Good evening.
Anyone home in there?

00:21:54.398 --> 00:21:55.607 position:50% align:center
[OHANA-BASAN]
We're closed.

00:21:55.691 --> 00:21:59.027 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA gasps]
Whoever it is sounds mean!

00:21:59.111 --> 00:22:01.405 position:50% align:center
[OHANA-BASAN] Come back
during business hours.

00:22:01.488 --> 00:22:03.782 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Kinda can't wait.

00:22:03.866 --> 00:22:05.868 position:50% align:center
[OHANA-BASAN]
What sort of case is it?

00:22:05.951 --> 00:22:07.619 position:50% align:center
A kemono one.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.165 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's you, Inugami.

00:22:12.249 --> 00:22:15.460 position:50% align:center
