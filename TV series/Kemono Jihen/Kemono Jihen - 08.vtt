You know,

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:03.747 position:50% align:center
when I heard those things
speaking like my Mom,

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.041 position:50% align:center
I realized something.

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:10.712 position:50% align:center
Even if I kill my uncle,
it won't bring anyone back.

00:11:10.796 --> 00:11:13.257 position:50% align:center
Which should've
been super-obvious.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.093 position:50% align:center
Once that sank in,
that was kinda it.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:19.388 position:50% align:center
The strong urge to kill that
bastard just disappeared.

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:23.183 position:50% align:center
And then, in its place, was the
desire to see my mom again.

00:11:23.267 --> 00:11:25.519 position:50% align:center
And that crushed me.

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:27.813 position:50% align:center
So the only thing left
now is emptiness.

Huh?

00:11:38.574 --> 00:11:40.576 position:50% align:center
Aya! You shouldn't be here!

00:11:40.659 --> 00:11:42.703 position:50% align:center
I told you to stay away
from these woods!

Would you be quiet.
You're not getting out of this,

let me act as I please!

What are you doing
with those guys?!

Don't just stand there, run!
Hurry and go!

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.839 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI] Why is he
freaking out so much?

00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:56.842 position:50% align:center
He's more worked up than when
he was about to be killed.

00:11:56.925 --> 00:12:00.512 position:50% align:center
You're a disgrace.
This is game over for you.

00:12:00.596 --> 00:12:03.473 position:50% align:center
But before you die,
tell me one thing.

00:12:03.557 --> 00:12:05.559 position:50% align:center
Where did you hide
the cocoon I made?

00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:07.686 position:50% align:center
Don't bother lying.

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:09.229 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:12:09.313 --> 00:12:12.649 position:50% align:center
You know, for a minute there
I thought it was over for me.

00:12:12.733 --> 00:12:14.318 position:50% align:center
But until I give you
what you want,

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:16.195 position:50% align:center
I've still got some time left.

00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:26.246 position:50% align:center
As long as I have the cocoon,

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.749 position:50% align:center
you know very well that
you can't leave me.

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:30.250 position:50% align:center
And if I were to die,

00:12:30.334 --> 00:12:33.212 position:50% align:center
you would stand no chance of
finding it all on your own.

00:12:33.295 --> 00:12:35.380 position:50% align:center
What are you gonna
do about that, Aya?

[AYA grunts]

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.258 position:50% align:center

Excuse me, but what's your deal,
popping up out of nowhere?

00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:42.930 position:50% align:center
I'd like to hurry and
finish him off ASAP.

Go ahead, try and persuade them.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.524 position:50% align:center
Tell them not to kill me.

00:12:53.607 --> 00:12:56.318 position:50% align:center

What matters isn't how
long you live on this rock.

00:13:25.973 --> 00:13:29.184 position:50% align:center

behind when you go.

Right.

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:35.232 position:50% align:center
The most important thing
to Uncle has always been

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:37.317 position:50% align:center
leaving some kind of legacy.

00:13:37.401 --> 00:13:38.861 position:50% align:center
His work.

00:13:38.944 --> 00:13:41.196 position:50% align:center
That's why he didn't
flip out as much before,

when he was about to be killed.

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:45.784 position:50% align:center
Because he had already
left something behind.

valued over his own life.
