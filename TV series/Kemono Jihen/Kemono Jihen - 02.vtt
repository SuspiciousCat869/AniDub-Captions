[AKIRA]
So, you're recruiting now?

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.042 position:50% align:center
One thing about kemono
is that whatever we do,

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.795 position:50% align:center
we make sure to not give
ourselves away to people.

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:12.007 position:50% align:center
To preserve our own
unique ecosystems.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.468 position:50% align:center
But... once in a while,
one of us steps out of line.

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:19.014 position:50% align:center
Kinda like a bear
wandering into a library.

We're a buffer between
our kind and humanity.

from consultations

to arbitrating disputes, all the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.984 position:50% align:center
You could call us "kemonoists."

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:33.111 position:50% align:center
"Kemonoists?"

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:35.321 position:50% align:center
You don't have to
answer right now.

Just do me a favor and
think it over, okay bud?

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:40.869 position:50% align:center
Uh! So you mean he's
a kemono, too?

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:42.829 position:50% align:center
He smells kind of unusual.

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:45.957 position:50% align:center

[SHIKI growls]
Hey!

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.464 position:50% align:center
No one asked for your
opinion on this, okay?

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:54.716 position:50% align:center
As for you!
You're wearing my clothes!

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.926 position:50% align:center
Don't do that without
asking first!

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.387 position:50% align:center
You have an absurd amount
of clothes just like that.

I don't want it now!

something that someone else

Thirteen, I think.

Well, guess what?
I happen to be 14.

You'd best keep
that in mind, kid.

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:24.621 position:50% align:center
Shiki, where do you
think you're going?

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:25.497 position:50% align:center

Not sharing my room!

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:33.630 position:50% align:center
He's an outsider, let him

Sheesh.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:37.467 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

That's how he is.

If he brought him

[INUGAMI] Well, what sanshichu
find to be a delicacy

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:28.738 position:50% align:center
is actually guilt.

00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:30.990 position:50% align:center
I'd bet those shoes
are likely stolen.

00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:32.450 position:50% align:center
--[AKIRA] Huh?

[BROTHER A]
Um, excuse me!

00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:36.996 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI] If it isn't
the older brother!

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.084 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER A] Um. I just wanted
to thank you personally.

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:43.837 position:50% align:center
You're looking for this guy.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.463 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER A]
Thank you very much!

00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:49.467 position:50% align:center
Really, I just...
Thank you so much!

00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:52.804 position:50% align:center
It's fine. I only did
what I needed to.

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:55.557 position:50% align:center
So, um, anyway.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.059 position:50% align:center
Listen, was there something
weird about our house

00:16:58.143 --> 00:16:59.936 position:50% align:center
that caused this to happen?

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.606 position:50% align:center
I-It's just... we don't have
a lot of money, you know?

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.942 position:50% align:center
So we'd rather not move.

00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:08.737 position:50% align:center
If you stay out of trouble,
you'll be okay.

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.865 position:50% align:center
But if I were you, I'd tell your
brother to return those shoes

00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:13.783 position:50% align:center
to wherever he got 'em.

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:17.245 position:50% align:center
[BROTHER A]
The shoes?

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:22.876 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course.
I had a feeling.

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:25.253 position:50% align:center
We're a single-parent household,

00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:27.505 position:50% align:center
and everything has
always been tight.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:29.841 position:50% align:center
Mom hardly ever
thinks of herself.

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:32.344 position:50% align:center
And her shoes are
really worn out.

00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:34.262 position:50% align:center
They've had holes
in them for so long,

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:36.473 position:50% align:center
but she hasn't replaced them.

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:39.684 position:50% align:center
Then, today...

00:17:39.768 --> 00:17:41.478 position:50% align:center
...my brother showed me these

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:44.189 position:50% align:center
and said he wanted
to give them to Mom.

00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:47.275 position:50% align:center
I knew immediately that
he'd shoplifted them.

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:49.361 position:50% align:center
It must have been
because it was for Mom,

00:17:49.444 --> 00:17:52.989 position:50% align:center
but he didn't seem to realize
what he did was wrong.

00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:55.241 position:50% align:center
I yelled at him for stealing.

00:17:55.325 --> 00:17:59.037 position:50% align:center
But then... his face
clouded over with guilt,

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.164 position:50% align:center
and a second later...

00:18:02.957 --> 00:18:06.503 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:08.630 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER A]
Hayato!

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.096 position:50% align:center
My Mom... really
hates bugs, too.

00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:19.849 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA whimpers]

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:21.559 position:50% align:center
Family, huh?

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:26.690 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI] Well, guys, I think
it's time for us to head home.

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:27.857 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Inugami?

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:29.943 position:50% align:center
[INUGAMI]
Hm?

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:33.279 position:50% align:center
One of my parents was
a kemono, weren't they?

00:18:33.363 --> 00:18:35.031 position:50% align:center
And you're a detective
that does it all

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:38.201 position:50% align:center
when it comes to helping
out kemono, right?

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:40.662 position:50% align:center
If I agree to work
for you, Inugami,

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:42.664 position:50% align:center
then do you think I could
meet my parents?

00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:43.957 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA, SHIKI gasp]

00:18:47.711 --> 00:18:50.714 position:50% align:center
Oh, man, bud.

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:52.924 position:50% align:center
You weren't exactly being
straight with me back then,

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:54.342 position:50% align:center
were ya?

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:56.928 position:50% align:center
You're the kid but you were
more concerned about me.

00:18:57.012 --> 00:19:00.015 position:50% align:center
[KABANE gasps]
I-I'm sorry.

00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:03.977 position:50% align:center
That's okay. Now I'm
gonna ask you again.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.520 position:50% align:center
Wanna meet your folks?

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:07.272 position:50% align:center
Yes I do.

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:09.649 position:50% align:center
That settles it.

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:12.235 position:50% align:center
I'll just take my fee
out of your paycheck.

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:14.904 position:50% align:center
Feel free to bug these guys
about odd jobs or whatever.

00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:18.825 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA giggles] It'll be so fun
to work with you. Can't wait!

00:19:22.537 --> 00:19:24.122 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI] It's not fair
that I'll only find out

00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:25.665 position:50% align:center
about your family.

00:19:25.749 --> 00:19:29.586 position:50% align:center
See, my Mother was an "Arachne,"
or a spider kemono.

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:32.922 position:50% align:center
That's why my sweat and saliva
are both like spider silk.

00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:34.049 position:50% align:center
Is she alive?

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:37.177 position:50% align:center
Maybe. Probably not.
How would I know?

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.511 position:50% align:center
Then she's alive.

00:19:38.595 --> 00:19:40.680 position:50% align:center
[SHIKI] Oh, really?
You're basing that on what?

00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:42.557 position:50% align:center
On that she might
not be dead.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.392 position:50% align:center
[growls]
Are you that stupid?

00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:46.227 position:50% align:center
That doesn't count as proof!

00:19:46.311 --> 00:19:48.646 position:50% align:center
Usually, when a parent gets
separated from their child,

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.940 position:50% align:center
they make some kind of
effort to find them!

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:53.651 position:50% align:center
And then you have our situation.

00:19:53.735 --> 00:19:55.945 position:50% align:center
Think about it rationally.

00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:57.572 position:50% align:center
They're dead,
or they've abandoned us

00:19:57.655 --> 00:19:59.491 position:50% align:center
and ditched responsibility.

00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:02.035 position:50% align:center
Grow up, kay, thirteen-year-old?

You don't know that.

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:04.496 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah?

00:20:04.579 --> 00:20:06.456 position:50% align:center
[KABANE] Maybe they're
alive and looking for us.

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:09.876 position:50% align:center
Forget it, kid, you need to
stop with the false hope.

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:11.086 position:50% align:center
Once you get betrayed,

00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:13.046 position:50% align:center
you're the one who's
gonna feel miserable.

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:15.048 position:50% align:center
[KABANE]
Even so.

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:16.341 position:50% align:center
I wasn't ditched.

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:18.009 position:50% align:center
And they're alive.

Tokyo is extremely bright.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.724 position:50% align:center
The village where I'm from
didn't have that many lights,

00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:27.560 position:50% align:center
and when night fell,
it got really dark.

00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:30.563 position:50% align:center
Up until yesterday, I'd never
had any doubt in my mind

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:32.941 position:50% align:center
that my parents
had abandoned me.

00:20:33.024 --> 00:20:36.736 position:50% align:center
Everything around me was dark,
without any reference points.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.865 position:50% align:center
Before yesterday, my life
had no light in it at all.

But then...

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:47.372 position:50% align:center
...Inugami came along
and lit one for me.

00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:48.790 position:50% align:center
And now...

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:52.669 position:50% align:center

Wanna see your bed?

00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:07.809 position:50% align:center
It's not out there.

C'mon, kid. I'll show
you where it is.

00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:14.107 position:50% align:center
It's not like you're a stranger.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:18.445 position:50% align:center
And if you snore, I won't
hesitate to pummel you, got it?

00:21:18.528 --> 00:21:21.156 position:50% align:center
I'll be careful. Appreciate it.

00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:22.824 position:50% align:center

How're you gonna be careful?

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:24.200 position:50% align:center

I don't know, somehow.

00:21:24.284 --> 00:21:26.411 position:50% align:center

Ah, you're always
so prickly, sheesh.

00:21:39.424 --> 00:21:42.427 position:50% align:center
Well, I've safely finished
that job you hired me for.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.596 position:50% align:center
Also have a bit of a report.

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:48.141 position:50% align:center
I've ended up taking in the
most fascinating hanyo boy.

00:21:48.224 --> 00:21:49.851 position:50% align:center
And guess what?

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:52.312 position:50% align:center
You won't believe it,
but he had a lifestone on him.

00:21:52.395 --> 00:21:53.772 position:50% align:center
[INARI]
He what?!

00:21:53.855 --> 00:21:57.442 position:50% align:center
And there it is. That's the
reaction I was going for.

00:21:57.525 --> 00:21:59.277 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna start
looking into why.

00:21:59.361 --> 00:22:01.988 position:50% align:center
But one thing for sure is,
he's not some stray hanyo.

00:22:02.072 --> 00:22:03.281 position:50% align:center
[INARI]
Is he a threat?

00:22:03.365 --> 00:22:05.950 position:50% align:center
A threat? Could be.

Too fluffy, can't sleep.

00:22:11.289 --> 00:22:14.501 position:50% align:center
