Huh. Guess nobody's home.

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:16.349 position:50% align:center
Which strikes me as odd.

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:18.518 position:50% align:center
This place is usually teeming
with adventurers,

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:20.186 position:50% align:center
but not today.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.189 position:50% align:center
Perhaps there was a monster
attack and they evacuated.

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:26.401 position:50% align:center
[MILDA] I highly doubt such
cowards would make it this far.

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:29.279 position:50% align:center
[GADWAIN] Reminds me of a story
an older acquaintance told me.

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:30.989 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:34.075 position:50% align:center
[GADWAIN] A long time ago,
a dragon kidnapped a woman

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:36.703 position:50% align:center
and held her captive
in this very dungeon,

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:40.248 position:50% align:center
so her lover and his partner
set out to rescue her.

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:42.917 position:50% align:center
They managed to defeat
the dragon, no problem.

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.086 position:50% align:center
But the mage who joined
the hero as a partner

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.547 position:50% align:center
turned traitor by
imprisoning his comrade

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.050 position:50% align:center
and leaving him to rot.

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.427 position:50% align:center
The hero never saw
his lover again

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.596 position:50% align:center
and died wallowing in despair.

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.639 position:50% align:center
And now, the ghost of
that unfortunate soul

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:59.976 position:50% align:center
haunts these halls,
looking to exact his revenge.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.605 position:50% align:center
Are you trying to suggest
a ghost did this?

00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:06.441 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but nothing's
more final than death.

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:09.778 position:50% align:center

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:12.739 position:50% align:center

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:14.657 position:50% align:center
[GADWAIN]
Are they ghosts?

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.744 position:50% align:center
Not quite. Judging from their
gear, I assume these men

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:20.789 position:50% align:center
are the adventurers
that were stationed here.

Well. That happened.

Yes, that it did.

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:51.319 position:50% align:center
And now we know why this
place was abandoned.

00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:53.613 position:50% align:center
At least to some extent.

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:59.119 position:50% align:center

00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:12.382 position:50% align:center
he's running around this

Hey. I can smell Kinji's scent.

Nah. Those have switches.

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:34.154 position:50% align:center
This was hidden
by illusion magic.

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:35.655 position:50% align:center
Ah, I get it.

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.868 position:50% align:center
Ninomiya must've left his undies
as a hint for us to find.

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:42.037 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] That does sound
like something he'd do,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.915 position:50% align:center
especially because it would make
the rest of us uncomfortable.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.751 position:50% align:center

Nah. Not now.

I understand why you wanna go,

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.075 position:50% align:center
but there's no way we'll
meet our quotas if you do.

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:21.284 position:50% align:center
C'mon. If you're just
gonna leave us

find a replacement.

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:24.996 position:50% align:center
Wow. Some pep talk.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.792 position:50% align:center
I'm detecting an incantation.
Or magic based on words.

your ears, you join their ranks.

was an infection of sorts.

Huh. I'm sensing
a strong magic flow.

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:44.683 position:50% align:center
It's coming from over there.

money it's the source

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.272 position:50% align:center
of the curse

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:52.899 position:50% align:center

I donno, they might.

00:03:57.278 --> 00:03:59.114 position:50% align:center

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:01.825 position:50% align:center
without the incantation
warping us, too?

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.953 position:50% align:center

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.824 position:50% align:center
and give our world
a brighter future.

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:31.868 position:50% align:center
But hanging out with
Ninomiya and everyone else

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:34.412 position:50% align:center
has been a surprising
bonus for me.

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:37.540 position:50% align:center
You enjoy his company? Wow.

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:40.418 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
I feel the same.

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:43.421 position:50% align:center
Despite what a selfish
miser that jerk can be,

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:46.800 position:50% align:center
spending time with him
is kind of nice.

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] You think he's
behind those doors?

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:52.097 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
I know he is.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.348 position:50% align:center
All right, then.

00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:56.559 position:50% align:center
He's no damsel, but I'll
save him nonetheless!

00:07:56.643 --> 00:08:00.772 position:50% align:center
[yelling] Mister Ninomiya!

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:02.148 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Oh, for the love of...

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:04.818 position:50% align:center
Put some more malice
into it, will ya?

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:06.653 position:50% align:center
Right! I'm trying!

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:08.613 position:50% align:center
Start succeeding instead!

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:10.782 position:50% align:center
[GHOST MAGE]
I'm sorry!

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:13.618 position:50% align:center
Okay. I'm confused.

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:18.039 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Eh? Hey. The gang's
all here. How's it goin'?

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:21.126 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] "How's it going"?
We thought you got abducted!

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:22.711 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
You technically thought right.

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:24.587 position:50% align:center
I did get abducted.

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:25.880 position:50% align:center
During that zombie ambush,

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:28.633 position:50% align:center
I was unceremoniously
dragged into the wall...

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:31.344 position:50% align:center
[KINJI yelping]

00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:33.638 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
...by this numbskull!

00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:34.723 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
Wait, who?

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:36.266 position:50% align:center
Well, believe it or not,

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.727 position:50% align:center
this freak show is the mage
from the story we heard earlier.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:39.894 position:50% align:center
No!

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:41.271 position:50% align:center
If that story's true,

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.440 position:50% align:center
then shouldn't this be
the hero that got deceived?

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:45.066 position:50% align:center
[GHOST MAGE]
Uh...

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.528 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] But you're
telling us it's the mage?

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:51.698 position:50% align:center
[GHOST MAGE] It's actually
a rather lengthy tale.

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:54.576 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Find a way to shorten it!

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:57.454 position:50% align:center
[GHOST MAGE]
Very well. I shall summarize.

00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:00.248 position:50% align:center
Several centuries ago,
I worked with a swordsman

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:02.625 position:50% align:center
who was widely
considered a hero.

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:07.422 position:50% align:center
But in truth, he was an
insufferably egotistical man.

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:09.841 position:50% align:center
One day, without even
asking my consent,

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:13.303 position:50% align:center
he accepted a contract to
save a maiden from a dragon.

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:14.971 position:50% align:center
Though I nearly
got myself killed,

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:16.848 position:50% align:center
I effectively slayed the beast.

00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:19.851 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, the proclaimed
"hero" watched from afar,

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:22.103 position:50% align:center
and only had one thing
to say afterwards.

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.230 position:50% align:center
[HERO A] This beauty and
I really hit it off!

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:25.440 position:50% align:center
You and I had a nice run,

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:27.442 position:50% align:center
but I think it's time we
end our partnership

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:29.986 position:50% align:center
and I work with her instead.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.446 position:50% align:center
[GHOST MAGE]
Those words of betrayal

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.907 position:50% align:center
sparked a burning
hatred in my heart.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.660 position:50% align:center
Despite us being long-time
partners, I used a barrier spell

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:40.205 position:50% align:center
and locked him away
in a fit of rage.

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:42.582 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] And suddenly the story
we heard makes more sense.

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:44.918 position:50% align:center
[GHOST MAGE] Unfortunately,
he was able to break through

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:48.213 position:50% align:center
the seal, and once he
was free, he declared me

00:09:48.296 --> 00:09:50.382 position:50% align:center
the backstabbing traitor.

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:54.344 position:50% align:center
The rumors flew, and I
soon lost my social status.

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.471 position:50% align:center
I was then left with
no choice but to work

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:58.973 position:50% align:center
in this dungeon under
terrible conditions.

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:00.600 position:50% align:center
I died from overexertion,

00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:03.728 position:50% align:center
cursing the whole world
with my last breath.

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:06.398 position:50% align:center
And now you're nothing more
than a vengeful spirit

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:07.732 position:50% align:center
who aimlessly
wanders these halls

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:10.026 position:50% align:center
because you're too
conflicted to pass on.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.444 position:50% align:center
[GHOST MAGE]
It's not aimless!

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:14.114 position:50% align:center
I go around making as many
people as possible suffer

00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:15.365 position:50% align:center
in the same way I did!

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:18.618 position:50% align:center
Ah, so Ninomiya was
just a random victim

00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:20.412 position:50% align:center
you were seeking to torment?

00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:22.997 position:50% align:center
[GHOST MAGE] Actually, his
perverse nature is quite similar

00:10:23.081 --> 00:10:25.000 position:50% align:center
to my aforementioned partner.

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:27.252 position:50% align:center
I got an unstoppable urge
to brainwash him

00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:28.962 position:50% align:center
with my own bony hands.

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:31.047 position:50% align:center
Okay, pal, if anybody's
brainwashing me,

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:33.508 position:50% align:center
it's not gonna be a
weak-willed loser like you!

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:36.720 position:50% align:center
Even in death, you have
your fair share of hardships.

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:38.263 position:50% align:center
[GHOST MAGE]
True.

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:40.640 position:50% align:center
But Mister Ninomiya's lectures
were tremendously beneficial

00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:42.767 position:50% align:center
and helped me come
to a decision!

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:44.602 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:46.479 position:50% align:center
[GHOST MAGE laughing]

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:48.356 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE gasps]

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:53.445 position:50% align:center
[GHOST MAGE laughing]

00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:56.448 position:50% align:center
[GHOST MAGE] I will break out of
here and invade the surface!

00:10:56.531 --> 00:11:00.910 position:50% align:center
Then, I will make the entire
planet suffer by forcing

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:05.623 position:50% align:center
its inhabitants to work until
they drop from exhaustion!

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:08.918 position:50% align:center
[GHOST MAGE laughing]

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:11.755 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
That escalated quickly.

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:13.757 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
So about your plan...

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.092 position:50% align:center
What you're saying sounds a
lot like corporate drones,

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:19.596 position:50% align:center
which exist pretty widely
in this world already.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.056 position:50% align:center
[GHOST MAGE]
What?

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:21.931 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:24.309 position:50% align:center
Spoiler alert, jeez!

00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:27.771 position:50% align:center
[GHOST MAGE]
Sorry. Could you elaborate?

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:29.606 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Sure thing, skulls.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:32.692 position:50% align:center
I know this may be hard to
swallow, but you're too late.

00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:35.070 position:50% align:center
This world's filled to the
brim with people suffering

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:37.030 position:50% align:center
in awful, dead-end
jobs that force them

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:39.157 position:50% align:center
to work until they
drop from exhaustion!

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.161 position:50% align:center
[whimpers] I had no idea.

00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:46.498 position:50% align:center
[GHOST MAGE] I never would
have dreamed humanity

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:51.127 position:50% align:center
would become so miserable
without me helping it along.

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:53.963 position:50% align:center
[GHOST MAGE]
In that case,

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:57.258 position:50% align:center
I can cross over
with no regrets.

00:11:57.342 --> 00:12:01.429 position:50% align:center
I apologize for all of
the trouble I caused you.

00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:04.557 position:50% align:center
And Mister Ninomiya?

00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:09.396 position:50% align:center
I enjoyed the last few moments
I spent with you. Very much.

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:14.401 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Mister Ninomiya.

00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:20.699 position:50% align:center
Hmph.

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:22.826 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Glad that's over with.

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:25.412 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
What an unsettling story.

00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:30.583 position:50% align:center
Problem?

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.335 position:50% align:center
No! Just mind your own business!

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:35.964 position:50% align:center
You were only gone for a bit,
but I really missed you!

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:37.173 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
Kinji!

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:38.383 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Jeez! My neck!

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:40.510 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
I'm starving!

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:44.848 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Get off of me! You're
both heavier than you look!

00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:48.560 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
They're surprisingly heavy,

00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:51.771 position:50% align:center
but together they're a
well-balanced party.

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:55.316 position:50% align:center
[CINDY]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.235 position:50% align:center
Sales for this week
are downright terrible!

00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:58.820 position:50% align:center
Headquarters is gonna
bite my head off again

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:01.072 position:50% align:center
when they see this!

00:13:01.156 --> 00:13:03.867 position:50% align:center
Oh! Why'd that mean,
old, backstabbing spirit

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.453 position:50% align:center
have to go and exact its revenge
on every last innocent person

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:08.246 position:50% align:center
that crossed its path anyway?

00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:10.206 position:50% align:center
Now our would-be
patrons are petrified

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:14.753 position:50% align:center
and won't come within a
five-mile radius of this place.

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:19.841 position:50% align:center
Bad luck aside, maybe I'm just
not cut out to run a business.

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:22.093 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
I need a manager!

00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:24.304 position:50% align:center
That would be me!
Hello! How may I--

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:26.389 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Do you have any brains
under all that hair?

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:28.058 position:50% align:center
These clothes are
obviously fraying,

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:30.685 position:50% align:center
but you still just sold
them to me anyway!

00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:34.147 position:50% align:center
[CINDY grumbles]
An entitled customer.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.940 position:50% align:center
[CINDY] I apologize for
the inconvenience.

00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:37.942 position:50% align:center
I'll bring you a replacement
shirt right away!

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:39.569 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
I don't need a replacement!

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:42.280 position:50% align:center
All I'm asking for is
a show of good faith!

00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:44.032 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure what you mean.

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:46.409 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
A discount! A big one!

00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:47.869 position:50% align:center
Ah. That, I understand.

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:49.788 position:50% align:center
But if memory serves,
the item in question

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:52.957 position:50% align:center
was already sold to you at an
extremely large discount, sir.

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:55.585 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] So what? I took a
defective good off your hands,

00:13:55.669 --> 00:13:57.295 position:50% align:center
so why not make my
next purchase free?

00:13:57.379 --> 00:14:00.298 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but that sounds
quite unreasonable to me.

00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:03.468 position:50% align:center
Come on! I'm basically just
asking you to be decent,

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:04.511 position:50% align:center
and that's unreasonable to you?

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:06.346 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
All right. That's enough!

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:09.057 position:50% align:center
Stop making a scene with
your petty complaints!

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.517 position:50% align:center
It's our turn to apologize.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.685 position:50% align:center
Oh, there's no need!

00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:13.687 position:50% align:center
I almost had her, hook,
line, and sinker!

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.022 position:50% align:center
We have no idea what
the next floor is like,

00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:18.733 position:50% align:center
so we could literally be
jumping headfirst into danger!

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:20.360 position:50% align:center
You may be fine with
dying down there,

I didn't say that.

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:25.907 position:50% align:center
Hey. You're just a random clerk

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.617 position:50% align:center
getting screwed
over by Raiza'ha.

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:29.452 position:50% align:center
We're all in the same,
shoddy boat.

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:30.704 position:50% align:center
[CINDY]
Huh?

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:32.288 position:50% align:center
I mean, how hard is it
to tell your higher-ups

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:35.417 position:50% align:center
that one defective good got
mixed in with the regulars?

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.168 position:50% align:center
This shop is a cog in a machine,

00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:40.380 position:50% align:center
so it's not like it has any
personal value for you, right?

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:42.257 position:50% align:center
--No. Not right.
--Huh?

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.552 position:50% align:center
Okay, so, I know how dejected
this place looks currently,

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:47.220 position:50% align:center
but I'll forever find it dear

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:52.017 position:50% align:center
since my father
entrusted it to me.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.269 position:50% align:center
After Raiza'ha bought up
the rights to our shop

00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:56.354 position:50% align:center
and imposed those
tough quotas, sure,

00:14:56.438 --> 00:15:00.817 position:50% align:center
things keep getting increasingly
worse! But even so!

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.528 position:50% align:center

buy it back from them!

I'm dedicating it to this store!

of backbone I like to see.

If there's one thing
I know, it's that

00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:15.707 position:50% align:center
goals and aspirations
should be personal.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.417 position:50% align:center
Those who're content with
what they're given

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.463 position:50% align:center
and want nothing more out of
life make me sick to my stomach.

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:22.630 position:50% align:center

when it's of little or no
consequence to me,

00:15:33.183 --> 00:15:35.101 position:50% align:center

I'll make an exception.

Uh.

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.271 position:50% align:center

[CINDY gasps]

00:15:40.732 --> 00:15:42.984 position:50% align:center
And in exchange, you'll
sell me your best gear

00:15:43.068 --> 00:15:44.444 position:50% align:center
at a huge employee discount,

00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:46.988 position:50% align:center

00:15:47.072 --> 00:15:48.365 position:50% align:center
you feel me?

Right! First things first!

00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:04.381 position:50% align:center
Knowing what the biggest
selling point for your store is

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:05.799 position:50% align:center
would help a ton.

00:16:05.882 --> 00:16:08.134 position:50% align:center
[CINDY] I don't think we have
a biggest selling point.

00:16:08.218 --> 00:16:09.427 position:50% align:center
Of course you do!

00:16:09.511 --> 00:16:12.764 position:50% align:center

Actually!

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:17.727 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] Well, these look
awfully familiar.

00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:20.021 position:50% align:center
[CINDY] That's interesting since
they're the potions concocted

00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:22.315 position:50% align:center
by those who fell victim
to the ghost mage.

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:25.110 position:50% align:center
Raiza'ha forced me to buy
every single bottle.

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:28.029 position:50% align:center
It would've wasted a lot of
resources if I hadn't.

00:16:28.113 --> 00:16:30.782 position:50% align:center
And the quality is definitely
on the lower side,

00:16:30.865 --> 00:16:33.910 position:50% align:center

sell them for dirt cheap.

[KINJI] My party and I have an
important mission to carry out,

00:20:53.003 --> 00:20:55.797 position:50% align:center
and we've dawdled
here long enough!

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.508 position:50% align:center
I trust you'll handle
everything going forward!

00:20:58.591 --> 00:21:00.719 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
He's making a run for it!

00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:02.178 position:50% align:center
Wait. Hold on.

00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:04.222 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] You can still sell
Dead Cow if it doesn't have

00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:06.933 position:50% align:center
the tainted ingredients
from that ghost mage!

00:21:07.017 --> 00:21:09.853 position:50% align:center
Good luck, Cindy! You'll grow
your business in no time!

00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:11.396 position:50% align:center
You got this!

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:13.314 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:21:13.398 --> 00:21:15.650 position:50% align:center
I know that you people heard me,
so what are you waiting for?

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:17.485 position:50% align:center
We're moving out!

00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:20.697 position:50% align:center
[CINDY]
He solves all of my problems

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.824 position:50% align:center
and then struts away
like it was nothing!

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:26.494 position:50% align:center
What a spectacularly
gallant hero of the people!

00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:30.457 position:50% align:center
Wait up, mister "gallant hero"!
Even you can recognize

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.375 position:50% align:center
that deserting her
is just inhumane!

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:34.044 position:50% align:center
You said you would help her,
and this situa--

00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:37.922 position:50% align:center
I planted the seeds, but she's
someone who can grow on her own.

00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:39.841 position:50% align:center
If I stuck around to see
how this plays out,

00:21:39.924 --> 00:21:41.426 position:50% align:center
I'd be robbing her
of the opportunity

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:44.262 position:50% align:center
to think for herself,
and that's much worse.

00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:47.390 position:50% align:center
I suppose if she's still moping
around by the time we visit

00:21:47.474 --> 00:21:50.477 position:50% align:center
again, the least I can do is
give her a slap on the back.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.605 position:50% align:center
First the stunt with the ghost
mage and now Cindy's shop.

00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:56.191 position:50% align:center
Honestly. Would it kill him
to help someone

00:21:56.274 --> 00:21:58.276 position:50% align:center
with no strings attached?

00:22:03.073 --> 00:22:05.950 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
So this is the fourth floor.

00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:12.374 position:50% align:center
You gotta be kidding me.
It doesn't even feel like

00:22:12.457 --> 00:22:15.085 position:50% align:center
I'm in the depths of
a dungeon anymore.
