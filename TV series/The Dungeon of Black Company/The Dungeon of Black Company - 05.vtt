00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.574 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:43.204 position:50% align:center
Please, sir.
Our world is in danger

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:45.957 position:50% align:center
and we need you
in order to save it!

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:22.345 position:50% align:center
Hold the phone.
Maybe I'm still groggy,

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:25.306 position:50% align:center
but did you just ask me
to save your world?

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.766 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.102 position:50% align:center
Not sure why you'd
want me for this.

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:31.438 position:50% align:center
But before I devote any
of my precious energy

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:35.191 position:50% align:center
to your absurd request...
Where the heck am I?

Hang on! Just give me
a minute and let me start over!

I know the Book of Prophecies

says what to do
for this sort of thing.

Here it is... If the
Messiah is confused

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:05.472 position:50% align:center
and starts bombarding
you with questions,

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:07.932 position:50% align:center
attempt to beg,
but do so by positioning

your face at the
most attractive angle

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:13.355 position:50% align:center

A priestess gifted
in the ways of magic,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.792 position:50% align:center
though perhaps we should've
focused on teaching

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:20.839 position:50% align:center
our protégé other things.
Like social skills, for example.

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:25.719 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
I don't care about manners,

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:27.971 position:50% align:center
just gimme the lowdown already.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:32.600 position:50% align:center
Right. Of course. Best to start
from the beginning, then, eh?

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:35.478 position:50% align:center
The cause of our troubles
happened 300 years ago

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:37.105 position:50% align:center
when a solitary corporation

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:40.442 position:50% align:center
brought the entire world
to the verge of ruin.

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:42.694 position:50% align:center
The negative influences
of capitalism

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:45.405 position:50% align:center
were strong within this company,
and it experienced

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:48.783 position:50% align:center
rapid growth by taking
advantage of its employees.

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:51.661 position:50% align:center
Soon, its destructive concepts
caught on everywhere,

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:54.247 position:50% align:center
spreading very
much like wildfire.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.125 position:50% align:center
Dividing the population
into the ruling class

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:58.293 position:50% align:center
and the corporate grunts

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.754 position:50% align:center
became common
practice within society.

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:03.048 position:50% align:center
The latter of the two groups
was the obvious majority,

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:04.466 position:50% align:center
and once they stopped thinking,

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:08.011 position:50% align:center
civilization began
to weaken as a result.

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:11.264 position:50% align:center
As if he'd been awaiting
that moment to exploit it,

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:13.224 position:50% align:center
the "Demon Lord"
appeared with his

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:16.394 position:50% align:center
legions of monsters and
took control of the world.

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.980 position:50% align:center
Defeated, we humans escaped
beneath the ground.

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:20.899 position:50% align:center
We've spent the past
three centuries

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:23.943 position:50% align:center
cowering in this dark shelter.

00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:26.780 position:50% align:center
During that time,
our resources dried up.

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:28.573 position:50% align:center
There's no telling
how much longer

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:30.408 position:50% align:center
we'll be able to last.

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:32.786 position:50% align:center
That is till we discovered
there's hope!

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:34.913 position:50% align:center
What kinda hope?

00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:44.881 position:50% align:center
[ZAZEL] It came in the form
of the Book of Prophecies

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:48.134 position:50% align:center
and the miraculous "Gate"
we found on the surface.

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:50.512 position:50% align:center
We made use of both
and managed to summon

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:53.723 position:50% align:center
an individual capable
of saving our world.

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:57.644 position:50% align:center
And in case you're wondering,
that individual is you!

00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:59.479 position:50% align:center

How could this alternate reality

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:03.358 position:50% align:center
expect more from me than Amuria?

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:06.319 position:50% align:center
[ZAZEL] We must spread
your gospel, Lord Messiah.

00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:10.240 position:50% align:center
Many will be elated by
this news, so follow me.

[CITIZEN D] With his help,
we can finally leave this cave!

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:29.300 position:50% align:center
Everyone in town has been
anticipating your arrival

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.469 position:50% align:center
and wanted to come
see you in the flesh.

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:34.514 position:50% align:center

of losers just holdin' out

[ZAZEL] Try not to
judge them too harshly.

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:45.275 position:50% align:center
They've been cooped up for years
without a goal to work towards.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:46.818 position:50% align:center
They deserve pity.

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:51.156 position:50% align:center
I beseech you, Lord Messiah.
Guide us to a brighter future!

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:54.200 position:50% align:center
Not interested. I say if
you've got crap to deal with,

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:56.578 position:50% align:center
then learn how to
wipe your own butt.

00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:58.663 position:50% align:center
[ZAZEL] I have something
that should make you

00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:02.083 position:50% align:center
a little more interested
in defeating the Demon Lord.

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:03.251 position:50% align:center

00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:05.670 position:50% align:center
Oh, come now. Hero or not,

00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:09.966 position:50% align:center
you can't possibly live with
yourself if you abandon us.

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:13.678 position:50% align:center
So much for the
pitiful and weak act.

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:17.015 position:50% align:center
Do you always resort to threats?
Either way, it doesn't matter

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:19.392 position:50% align:center
'cause I still
ain't gonna help.

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:24.522 position:50% align:center
[ZAZEL]
There's a certain excerpt

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:26.608 position:50% align:center
from the Book of Prophecies.

00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:30.195 position:50% align:center
It says, "At the moment in time
when the Messiah faces

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:33.573 position:50% align:center
the Demon Lord, the road
to 'Japan' will be opened."

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:35.283 position:50% align:center
What?

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:38.536 position:50% align:center
Though we have no idea
where this "Japan" place is,

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.914 position:50% align:center
something tells me that you do.

Are you interested in defeating

Gimme a break.

does that mean...?

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:18.034 position:50% align:center
[ZAZEL] As our priestess,
Ranga will be blessing you

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:20.078 position:50% align:center
with her presence
on your journey.

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:22.872 position:50% align:center
Don't see how this airhead's
considered a blessing.

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:24.290 position:50% align:center
I can already tell
she's more like

00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:25.500 position:50% align:center
a burden than anything.

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:28.628 position:50% align:center
Aw! Don't write me off
so easily, Ninomiya!

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:32.757 position:50% align:center
It'll be fun, promise!
You won't regret it!

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:37.887 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:40.598 position:50% align:center
My special place has been
violated by the Messiah.

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:43.893 position:50% align:center
Huh. Who'd've thought.
You're a guy.

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:46.354 position:50% align:center
[ZAZEL] The prophecy said that
the child with magical powers

00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:48.606 position:50% align:center
must become the "priestess."
And this boy was

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.859 position:50% align:center
the only one in our town
gifted with any magic,

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:53.403 position:50% align:center
so we kind of had no choice.

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.363 position:50% align:center
If that book told you
to jump off a bridge,

00:10:55.447 --> 00:10:56.698 position:50% align:center
I bet you'd do that, too!

00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:59.117 position:50% align:center
Maybe this trash heap is
doomed for a good reason!

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.953 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] Aww...
Is somebody disappointed?

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:03.204 position:50% align:center
Like hell.

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:05.206 position:50% align:center
It's nobody's fault that
you got the wrong idea.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.083 position:50% align:center
I give everyone here
a run for their money

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:08.460 position:50% align:center
in the cute department.

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:11.129 position:50% align:center
But for the sake of
professionalism and the mission,

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:13.673 position:50% align:center
please control your urges.

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:18.345 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] And another troublemaker
joins the fray!

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:22.390 position:50% align:center
That wasn't an invite
to mess up my hair!

00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:23.933 position:50% align:center
Respect the do, dude!

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:25.935 position:50% align:center
Listen, do your thing,
wear whatever you want,

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:28.438 position:50% align:center
be whoever you are,
but you're ten years too early

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:31.608 position:50% align:center
for this whole "sexy"
thing you're trying.

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:36.529 position:50% align:center
[gasps, laughs] That's okay!

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:38.114 position:50% align:center
I'll make you want
me eventually,

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:39.449 position:50% align:center
just wait and see!

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.493 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
If you say so, brat.

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:43.870 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
The name's Ranga, not brat!

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:46.164 position:50% align:center
Did you forget already?

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:49.626 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Doesn't get much more
absurd than combatting

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.836 position:50% align:center
a "Demon Lord" in another world.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.298 position:50% align:center
No use complaining
about it, though.

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:58.927 position:50% align:center
All right! Hang on
to your short shorts!

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:11.731 position:50% align:center
Now there's a plot twist
I wasn't expecting.

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
This isn't another world.
It's Amuria's future.

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:26.788 position:50% align:center
That's insane.

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:29.165 position:50% align:center
I knew Raiza'ha was as crooked
as a company can get,

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:31.876 position:50% align:center
but I never thought they'd
actually destroy the world.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.920 position:50% align:center
They say things really
started going crazy

00:12:34.004 --> 00:12:36.589 position:50% align:center
once someone named Belza
became the leader.

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center
I believe it. The bigger
they build their statues,

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:43.471 position:50% align:center
the harder they fall,
and Belza's was huge.

00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:45.890 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Huh? Hey, Ninomiya.

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:46.808 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.018 position:50% align:center
[RIM grunts]

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:51.271 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Uhh! Ah, jeez!
We gotta step on it!

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:52.522 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Why?

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:53.690 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Rim finished her
snacks and you can tell

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:55.734 position:50% align:center
from her eyes that
we're next on the menu!

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:59.029 position:50% align:center
That's the look of an animal
seconds away from pouncing!

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:01.448 position:50% align:center
How much farther, dang it?

00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:05.368 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Umm. There!

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:07.370 position:50% align:center
Do you see that fortress
beyond the cliffs?

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:09.706 position:50% align:center
That's the Demon
Lord's castle! I think.

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:11.499 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Awesome!

00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:25.597 position:50% align:center
I'm so hungry.

00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:30.435 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] We've made it to
the belly of the beast.

00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:34.939 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] I can't rely on Rim
in her current state,

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:36.649 position:50% align:center
so what can I do?

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:38.860 position:50% align:center
We have to get inside
the Demon Lord's stronghold

00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:42.781 position:50% align:center
without him noticing somehow.
Then carefully gather intel.

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:46.910 position:50% align:center
[RANGA laughs]
Shabam!

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:50.205 position:50% align:center
[KINJI grunting]

00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:54.501 position:50% align:center
What in the world
possessed you to do that?!

00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:55.710 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
What else?

00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:57.879 position:50% align:center
I'm initiating
"Operation: Magic Go Boom."

00:13:57.962 --> 00:13:59.422 position:50% align:center
You came to fight
the Demon Lord.

00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:02.550 position:50% align:center
Well, now--it's go time.

00:14:02.634 --> 00:14:06.304 position:50% align:center
What in the world possessed
you to break down our door?

00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:07.430 position:50% align:center
[KINJI grunts]

00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:09.724 position:50% align:center
Morons. Do you have
the slightest idea

00:14:09.808 --> 00:14:11.476 position:50% align:center
who this place belongs to?

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:13.895 position:50% align:center
This is the "General Ant Farm,"
home to the esteemed

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:15.897 position:50% align:center
assistant commander
of the Demon Lord Army,

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.693 position:50% align:center
so show some respect, will ya?

00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:22.696 position:50% align:center
Wait, hold on, did you just
say assistant commander?

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:24.114 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:26.199 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
And "General Ant Farm"?

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:28.118 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:31.913 position:50% align:center
You have an operation
to take this jerk down,

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:33.623 position:50% align:center
but you don't know
where he lives?!

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:35.041 position:50% align:center
This isn't his castle?

00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:38.128 position:50% align:center
Oopsie, I guess I must've made
a wrong turn somewhere.

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:41.756 position:50% align:center
I made an important discovery,
though! We're twinsies!

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.842 position:50% align:center
Okay. Can I hit this kid?

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:48.304 position:50% align:center
As much as I'd love to see that,
I've wasted enough time here!

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:50.557 position:50% align:center
I have a goal that
I'm trying to reach.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.560 position:50% align:center
Now that I've made it this far,
nothing is gonna stop me!

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:56.146 position:50% align:center
Rim! You're up!

00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:01.776 position:50% align:center
--[KINJI] Hm?
--[screaming]

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.112 position:50% align:center
[MONSTER A]
What is this thing?

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:06.614 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
I'm hungry!

00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:08.408 position:50% align:center
[MONSTER A]
You can't just eat all our food!

00:15:08.491 --> 00:15:14.330 position:50% align:center
[RIM] Watch me! I'll eat
it all and then some!

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:17.625 position:50% align:center
I am so sorry about her.

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:20.295 position:50% align:center
[CERBERUS]
Hmph. General Ant, sir!

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:21.588 position:50% align:center
I brought you the trespassers

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:23.673 position:50% align:center
who were making a scene
at the north gate!

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:25.133 position:50% align:center
We got to meet
someone as important

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:27.427 position:50% align:center
as one of the Demon Lord's
generals right away!

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.138 position:50% align:center
"Operation: Magic Go Boom"
is a huge success!

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:31.431 position:50% align:center
Great work, team!

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:33.808 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Give it a rest, you dumb brat.

00:15:33.892 --> 00:15:35.977 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL ANT]
Honestly, I don't expect humans

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:40.106 position:50% align:center
to be able to do any
real harm at this point.

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:47.322 position:50% align:center
But I won't drop my guard
and let you do as you please.

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:50.992 position:50% align:center
You'll tell me what I want to
know down to the last detail.

00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:53.578 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] This guy's intense.
Then again, I doubt

00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:58.458 position:50% align:center
a pushover could earn the title
of a Demon Lord General.

00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:04.339 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL ANT] Huh? Wait, I don't
believe it! This is amazing!

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:07.509 position:50% align:center
It has to be you!
You're Mister Ninomiya, right?

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:10.804 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That's me. But how
do you know who I am?

00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:12.263 position:50% align:center
Have we met before?

00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:15.600 position:50% align:center
A long time ago. It's me,
Dungeon Ant A!

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:16.601 position:50% align:center
You for real?!

00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:17.852 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL ANT]
Yes!

00:16:17.936 --> 00:16:19.771 position:50% align:center
You are blowing my mind
if you're being serious!

00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:21.272 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL ANT]
Ha! Dead serious!

00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:23.692 position:50% align:center
The same Ant A
from your old team!

00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:25.610 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
You, uh, changed your look.

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:27.654 position:50% align:center
I suppose I went through
a bit of a growth spurt

00:16:27.737 --> 00:16:30.949 position:50% align:center
since I last saw you,
then my rank went up a little.

00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:35.537 position:50% align:center
That's more than just a little!
Ant A, I'm genuinely impressed!

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.747 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL ANT]
Oh! Thank you!

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:41.418 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL ANT]
I see Miss Rim

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:44.045 position:50% align:center
still has her
voracious appetite.

00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:46.172 position:50% align:center
What happened to the
rest of the colony?

00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:48.800 position:50% align:center
Did they all turn into
bodybuilder ants like you did?

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:50.844 position:50% align:center
We had troubles before
you entered our lives,

00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:53.513 position:50% align:center
so of course we had troubles
after you disappeared.

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:56.433 position:50% align:center
The majority of my kind
retreated back underground.

00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:57.684 position:50% align:center
And those who remained

00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:59.894 position:50% align:center
received the blessing
of the great Demon Lord.

00:16:59.978 --> 00:17:01.730 position:50% align:center
We're able to walk
proudly on the surface

00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:04.983 position:50% align:center
and rule over humans as
if we're all queens now.

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:06.359 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:17:06.443 --> 00:17:08.945 position:50% align:center
I know it's been a few
hundred years, give or take,

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:11.156 position:50% align:center
but I remember the moments
I spent with you

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
as if they happened yesterday.

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:14.242 position:50% align:center
You're surprisingly
well connected.

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:16.369 position:50% align:center
Wow. You have my respect!

00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:17.620 position:50% align:center
Is that a fact?

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:19.456 position:50% align:center
Even though I'm
blatantly fraternizing

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:21.207 position:50% align:center
with the Demon Lord's
subordinate?

00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:23.126 position:50% align:center
You aren't bothered by that?

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:25.545 position:50% align:center
Not at all. Honestly...

00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:27.380 position:50% align:center
As soon as I took
a breath of fresh air,

00:17:27.464 --> 00:17:30.008 position:50% align:center
I was just happy to be outside.

00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:34.054 position:50% align:center
A dark, dreary atmosphere really
wears you down after a while.

00:17:34.137 --> 00:17:35.597 position:50% align:center
And...

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:38.725 position:50% align:center
And what?

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:40.393 position:50% align:center
I was done talking, I swear!

00:17:40.477 --> 00:17:41.644 position:50% align:center
And besides, the general's past

00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:43.855 position:50% align:center
sounds more intriguing
than mine!

00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:47.317 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL ANT] Eh, I don't know
if I'd say "intriguing."

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.403 position:50% align:center
Back then, I was just your
everyday ant-type monster.

00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:52.906 position:50% align:center
We sure had some good times.

00:17:52.989 --> 00:17:54.491 position:50% align:center
Under Mister
Ninomiya's command,

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:58.203 position:50% align:center
we took on foes we would've
never dreamed of besting!

00:17:58.286 --> 00:18:02.665 position:50% align:center
That era's what sparked the
fire that burns in me today.

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:06.961 position:50% align:center
Then again, that passion feels
more like dying embers lately.

00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:09.673 position:50% align:center
Did something happen?

00:18:09.756 --> 00:18:11.800 position:50% align:center
The truth is...

00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:18.139 position:50% align:center
You oversized insect! Ah!

00:18:18.223 --> 00:18:21.810 position:50% align:center
I was still eating that!
What a colossal waste of food!

00:18:21.893 --> 00:18:23.812 position:50% align:center
It was so yummy, too.

00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:26.147 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
You ruined Rim's meal.

00:18:26.231 --> 00:18:28.149 position:50% align:center
Care to explain yourself?

00:18:28.233 --> 00:18:30.485 position:50% align:center
I'm here to say that
I've had enough of you!

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:33.780 position:50% align:center
I'll use my last breath
to defy you if I have to!

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:36.866 position:50% align:center
Bugs shouldn't treat
humans like bugs--

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:40.787 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
You will be punished.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.831 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:45.417 position:50% align:center
Settle down, Rim.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.836 position:50% align:center
Clearly there's something
this man wants to voice,

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:49.087 position:50% align:center
so let's hear him out.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.714 position:50% align:center
Well?

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:53.216 position:50% align:center
Enough is enough!
We're standing our ground!

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:54.634 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:56.011 position:50% align:center
[GRUNT A] None of us are willing
to work a second longer

00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:57.887 position:50% align:center
under such horrible conditions!

00:18:57.971 --> 00:18:59.264 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Like...?

00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:01.641 position:50% align:center
[GRUNT A] Working eight
grueling hours every day.

00:19:01.725 --> 00:19:04.477 position:50% align:center
And we're only allotted
two days of rest per week!

00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:07.939 position:50% align:center
There's barely time for fun,
and waking up is so hard!

00:19:08.023 --> 00:19:10.316 position:50% align:center
Then we're forced to buy
this "insurance" of yours.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.444 position:50% align:center
Which I know is some
scam that exploits us

00:19:12.527 --> 00:19:14.112 position:50% align:center
if we get injured or sick!

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:15.363 position:50% align:center
They're trying to milk us

00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:18.575 position:50% align:center
for everything we're
worth until we die!

00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:19.951 position:50% align:center
[GRUNT A groans]

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:21.870 position:50% align:center
If you think that's milking,
you've never met a cow!

00:19:21.953 --> 00:19:25.957 position:50% align:center
Are we fighting? Am I
doing it right, Ninomiya?

00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:27.375 position:50% align:center
Is this what you
were gonna tell me

00:19:27.459 --> 00:19:29.669 position:50% align:center
before you were so
rudely interrupted?

00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:30.962 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL ANT grunts]

00:19:31.046 --> 00:19:32.547 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL ANT] You had a big
impact on my race

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:33.840 position:50% align:center
all those years ago.

00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:35.925 position:50% align:center
You instilled the belief
that proper work

00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:38.970 position:50% align:center
must be rewarded with
proper compensation.

00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:40.805 position:50% align:center
So while we did
conquer humankind,

00:19:40.889 --> 00:19:42.932 position:50% align:center
we also did our best
to provide them

00:19:43.016 --> 00:19:46.186 position:50% align:center
with a deal anyone
would deem fair.

00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:50.815 position:50% align:center
But it was in vain.
Those lazy bums just won't work.

00:19:50.899 --> 00:19:55.528 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL ANT sobs]

00:19:55.612 --> 00:19:57.572 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL ANT] What's worse
is we're the backbone

00:19:57.655 --> 00:19:59.908 position:50% align:center
of the Demon Lord Army.

00:19:59.991 --> 00:20:02.452 position:50% align:center
Then why not bring this
matter to your Demon Lord

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:05.372 position:50% align:center
and see what he thinks?
He's the big boss, isn't he?

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:06.706 position:50% align:center
It's not that simple.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.792 position:50% align:center
When my lord chooses to
make a public appearance,

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:10.168 position:50% align:center
it's a rare day, indeed.

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:11.878 position:50% align:center
Only the highest-ranking
officers

00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:15.048 position:50% align:center
can hope to be
granted an audience.

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:17.008 position:50% align:center
[GRUNT A yelps]

00:20:17.092 --> 00:20:18.927 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL ANT]
The sole opportunity I have

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:22.305 position:50% align:center
is at board meetings.

00:20:22.389 --> 00:20:24.974 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Guess he's got it rough, too.

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:27.185 position:50% align:center
Figures, though.

00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
I thought someone with
the title "Demon Lord"

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:32.440 position:50% align:center
would be all arrogant,
rolling out the red carpet

00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:34.109 position:50% align:center
for interlopers like me
so they'd have

00:20:34.192 --> 00:20:37.153 position:50% align:center
an ear they could gloat to.

00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:40.907 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Your troubles are over.
I'll handle this, Ant A.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.450 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL ANT]
Hm?

00:20:42.534 --> 00:20:45.370 position:50% align:center
I'll teach you the secret to
achieving maximum efficiency.

00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:48.081 position:50% align:center
All while staying in
the black, of course.

00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:51.167 position:50% align:center
You would actually
do that for me?

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:53.211 position:50% align:center
After that day, Mister Ninomiya

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:55.672 position:50% align:center
changed our name from
"General Ant Farm" to

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:57.882 position:50% align:center
"Dungeon Black Company:
of the Future"

00:20:57.966 --> 00:21:01.428 position:50% align:center
and comprehensively overhauled
our corporate structure.

00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:03.972 position:50% align:center
He first exacerbated
the workers' discontent

00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:07.517 position:50% align:center
by reinforcing the existing
dominance hierarchy.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.645 position:50% align:center
People who resisted the commands
of those above them

00:21:10.729 --> 00:21:12.856 position:50% align:center
were relentlessly punished.

00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:13.982 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile...

00:21:14.065 --> 00:21:17.610 position:50% align:center
[MONSTER C]
Excellent work today!

00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:19.779 position:50% align:center
Thank you! My pleasure!

00:21:19.863 --> 00:21:21.740 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL ANT] Those who
demonstrated good behavior

00:21:21.823 --> 00:21:23.658 position:50% align:center
and hard work were
offered bonuses

00:21:23.742 --> 00:21:26.119 position:50% align:center
and the right to oversee
their own subordinates.

00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:28.496 position:50% align:center
A clear pecking order
was soon established,

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:29.914 position:50% align:center
and as a result...

00:21:29.998 --> 00:21:32.667 position:50% align:center
[GRUNTS]
I love my job!

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:35.003 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL ANT] The humans' pride
was put on display

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:37.130 position:50% align:center
and their desire for
recognition created

00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:39.049 position:50% align:center
a competitive work environment.

00:21:39.132 --> 00:21:41.176 position:50% align:center
Employees that were
once defiant suddenly

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:45.513 position:50% align:center
found themselves devoting
their whole hearts to the job.

00:21:45.597 --> 00:21:47.599 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL ANT sighs]

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:52.687 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Oh, man. I am
just the worst for this.

00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:54.606 position:50% align:center
But it turns out
I have more to gain

00:21:54.689 --> 00:21:56.232 position:50% align:center
from siding with the Demon Lord.

00:21:56.316 --> 00:21:59.110 position:50% align:center
I am now the Demon Lord's
assistant commander

00:21:59.194 --> 00:22:02.113 position:50% align:center
and director of the new
business development team.

00:22:02.197 --> 00:22:05.617 position:50% align:center
As such, you all may refer
to me as General Ninomiya.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:06.868 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:10.080 position:50% align:center
This town is officially
under my jurisdiction!

00:22:10.163 --> 00:22:10.955 position:50% align:center
[ZAZEL gasping]

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:12.165 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
No worries, though.

00:22:12.248 --> 00:22:14.167 position:50% align:center
With me at the helm,
it'll be three times

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:17.420 position:50% align:center
more peaceful
than it's ever been.

00:22:17.504 --> 00:22:19.214 position:50% align:center
Let's go!
