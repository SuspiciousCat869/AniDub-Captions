00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:40.081 position:50% align:center
That's the stuff.

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:42.083 position:50% align:center
What a crazy turn of events.

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:43.585 position:50% align:center
I mean, who'd've thought?

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:46.421 position:50% align:center
Used to talk so big
about saving the world,

00:00:46.504 --> 00:00:50.884 position:50% align:center
and now I'm working for the
Demon Lord's Army myself.

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:53.386 position:50% align:center
So bizarre. But... oh, well.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.929 position:50% align:center
--[KINJI] Hey!
--What the--?

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:57.807 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Behold, the secret
Devil's Hot Spring!

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:01.019 position:50% align:center
This place looks surprisingly
relaxing, despite its name!

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:04.105 position:50% align:center
But that's what
I was hoping for!

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.232 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
Cannonball!

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:18.787 position:50% align:center
Why do you never rinse
off before you get in?

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.080 position:50% align:center
You know,
I'm willing to overlook

00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:21.831 position:50% align:center
most of your personality faults,

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:24.626 position:50% align:center
but irresponsible public
bathing ain't gonna fly!

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:25.710 position:50% align:center
Tell her, Ranga!

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:26.920 position:50% align:center
[RANGA yelps]

00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:28.004 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
What?

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:31.508 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] I, uh...
Well. Th-That's, um...

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:34.260 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! Uh! I mean, ew!

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:38.390 position:50% align:center
Gimme a break. It's nothing
you haven't seen before, right?

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.482 position:50% align:center
No! No, no, no, no!
Self control!

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:50.568 position:50% align:center
It's just that I can't help
but feel a little threatened.

00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:51.611 position:50% align:center
Whatever.

00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:54.447 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
Stop! It's bath time!

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:58.660 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] I think I deserve this
since I managed to get promoted

00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:01.037 position:50% align:center
from my previous position
to the Demon Lord Army's

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:03.289 position:50% align:center
Western Invasion Force Director.

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:06.126 position:50% align:center
[laughs] You're as impressive
as you are weird,

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:07.127 position:50% align:center
I'll give you that.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.004 position:50% align:center
But this promotion's not enough.

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:10.880 position:50% align:center
If I want any hope of
returning to Japan,

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.007 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna need to meet with

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.009 position:50% align:center
this Lord of Demons
face-to-face.

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:15.760 position:50% align:center
They'd have to hold a
board meeting in order

00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:17.429 position:50% align:center
for that to happen,
though, wouldn't they?

00:02:17.512 --> 00:02:20.140 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] That they would, which
is why I fully intend to dispose

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:22.976 position:50% align:center
of all high-ranking officials
who might get in my way.

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.104 position:50% align:center
Yup. There's no stopping
my rise to the top!

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:30.692 position:50% align:center
After all, I'm me!
The one and only!

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:34.654 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] Uh! Warn me before
you stand up next time!

00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:36.281 position:50% align:center
[KINJI laughing]

00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:39.451 position:50% align:center
[ROU] I see. So this
is General Ninomiya.

00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:41.619 position:50% align:center
Rumor has it General Ant
introduced him

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:43.913 position:50% align:center
to the Demon Lord's Army.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.833 position:50% align:center
If I've said it once,
I've said it a thousand times.

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:50.378 position:50% align:center
Kids these days have no respect
and just focus on results!

00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:52.714 position:50% align:center
To truly make it in
the society we've built,

00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:55.050 position:50% align:center
one must have reverence
for all things!

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:57.552 position:50% align:center
That's funny coming from you
since I could've sworn

00:02:57.635 --> 00:02:59.012 position:50% align:center
I heard you telling
your subordinate

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:02.098 position:50% align:center
there's no value to his life
if he doesn't get results.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.851 position:50% align:center
What's the matter, gramps?
You going senile?

00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:06.895 position:50% align:center
Silence! You smack
your men around,

00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:10.523 position:50% align:center
but that doesn't mean
you can smack talk me!

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:14.569 position:50% align:center
[POWER grunts] You need to stop
spitting everywhere,

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:16.321 position:50% align:center
it's disgusting.

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:19.824 position:50% align:center
[ZECHS] Hmph. I can practically
feel my IQ dropping

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:22.744 position:50% align:center
simply from bearing witness
to your emotional outbursts.

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:26.664 position:50% align:center
Though, seeing you get so
physical does have two perks.

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:31.002 position:50% align:center
Oh... Something's rising,
but it's not my IQ!

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:33.129 position:50% align:center
I know you're still
a virgin and all that,

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.839 position:50% align:center
but don't be creepy!

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:37.217 position:50% align:center
[ZECHS]
I-I'm not a virgin!

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.552 position:50% align:center
[ROU] Can we stay
on the topic at hand?

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:43.556 position:50% align:center
My time's too valuable to
be wasted by such nonsense!

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.892 position:50% align:center
I'm not very fond of
old men complaining.

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:48.520 position:50% align:center
Makes me wanna break jaws
more than I already do.

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:51.523 position:50% align:center
[ZECHS] Must violence always
be the answer for you?

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:54.359 position:50% align:center
One of your critical blows to
my brain may be a critical blow

00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:56.403 position:50% align:center
to the Demon Lord's Army
one day.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:59.781 position:50% align:center
Focus! If we don't do something
about this nuisance now,

00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:02.242 position:50% align:center
our status will be
put at risk as well!

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.452 position:50% align:center
The protruding nail
must get the hammer!

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:06.329 position:50% align:center
That is our motto!

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:09.332 position:50% align:center
We are the Special Executive
Benefit Fraternity,

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:10.709 position:50% align:center
the Three Ravens!

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.920 position:50% align:center
And we cannot allow our
positions to be undermined!

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:53.645 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL ANT]
Mister Ninomiya.

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:55.480 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you
want to do this?

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:58.692 position:50% align:center
Of course. It's an order
straight from the brass.

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:00.193 position:50% align:center
They really want you
to hunt down

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:03.238 position:50% align:center
the monsters that abandoned
the Demon Lord's Army?

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:04.531 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL ANT]
Doesn't seem like a job

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:07.742 position:50% align:center
for someone with
Director status, though.

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:12.580 position:50% align:center
[POWER laughs] Don't be shy,
darlin', come right this way!

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:14.416 position:50% align:center
Yes. So I can rev up

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:16.376 position:50% align:center
"Operation: Forcing
into the family"

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:19.254 position:50% align:center
and ram it down your throat!

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:26.886 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Oof. They look tough!

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.806 position:50% align:center
[POWER] Let's see how he
handles these monsters!

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.516 position:50% align:center
What they lack in
brains they more

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:33.184 position:50% align:center
than make up for in brawn!

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:35.562 position:50% align:center
Since his muscles don't seem
to be built for fighting,

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.188 position:50% align:center
this shouldn't take long.

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:39.566 position:50% align:center
And once those deserters
rough him up a little,

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:42.861 position:50% align:center
I'll ride to the rescue!
Establishing an irreversible

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:45.196 position:50% align:center
power structure
between the two of us!

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.157 position:50% align:center
Cry! Scream!

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.909 position:50% align:center
And bow down to your
most powerful boss!

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:53.288 position:50% align:center
You are in way
over your head now!

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.915 position:50% align:center
[WORM A screams]

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:58.668 position:50% align:center
Wow! Took one hit
to send it flying!

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:00.211 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL ANT]
There's no stopping the force

00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:02.047 position:50% align:center
that is Miss Rim.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.132 position:50% align:center
[POWER]
Uh--!

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.220 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Well? Is that it?

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:12.349 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL ANT] Oh. It appears the
Big Worm would rather join up

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:13.892 position:50% align:center
with you than remain your enemy.

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:17.270 position:50% align:center
That so? Can't hurt to
have more monster-power.

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:18.772 position:50% align:center
Welcome aboard.

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:21.399 position:50% align:center
Guess I should stop
being so awesome!

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:23.360 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna get promoted again!

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:26.112 position:50% align:center
[KINJI laughing]

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:31.368 position:50% align:center
Screw that guy!
He makes me so mad!

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:34.788 position:50% align:center
[ZECHS] Hmph. I deduced
as much from the beginning.

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:37.332 position:50% align:center
The second she divulged
that meat-headed "operation,"

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:39.376 position:50% align:center
I knew that it was
doomed to fail.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:44.464 position:50% align:center
Kids these days.
What is our world coming to?

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:46.299 position:50% align:center
I'll show you how it's done!

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:49.844 position:50% align:center
You know that land cultivation
project I've been pushing for?

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:53.932 position:50% align:center
It's about to get a new recruit!

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:57.268 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] What? We have to
turn this place into a farm?

00:07:57.352 --> 00:08:00.313 position:50% align:center
Yep. According to our
latest orders, at least.

00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:02.148 position:50% align:center
[ROU]
He's utterly stumped!

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:05.402 position:50% align:center
[ROU laughing]
Kids these days...

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:08.738 position:50% align:center
There's no way he can grow crops
in such a barren wasteland.

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:10.782 position:50% align:center
He'll be stuck here
getting nowhere fast,

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:13.702 position:50% align:center
while my choice subordinates
will get undeniable results,

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:17.122 position:50% align:center
making the gap in
productivity ginormous!

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:19.249 position:50% align:center
The Demon Lord will lose
all interest in him

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
and he'll wither away into
a mere corporate grunt,

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:24.337 position:50% align:center
while my position will
be safe for eternity!

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:26.172 position:50% align:center
--[laughing]
--[KINJI whistles]

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:28.341 position:50% align:center
Why is he whistling?

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:33.013 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Ah, yeah! Nothing like
a giant worm to help you

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:35.682 position:50% align:center
with your soil woes.
This'll make it nice and rich!

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:37.892 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
He plows fast for his size!

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:40.103 position:50% align:center
Now we just need to
plant this, right?

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:43.606 position:50% align:center
Right! When food's a problem,
potatoes are the best to grow.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.860 position:50% align:center
Oh. Don't forget to apply
your magic to it first.

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:50.780 position:50% align:center
'Kay. So, uh...
Grow, grow, grow and grow.

00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:55.618 position:50% align:center
How big you'll get,
no one knows!

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:59.414 position:50% align:center
Hey! Good job! I always knew
that you'd come in handy!

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:10.133 position:50% align:center
Then there's our
other magical teammate.

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:14.721 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL ANT] Oh, no!
She's trying to eat him.

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:18.058 position:50% align:center
Ant A! Do you remember the shell
of that boss we took down?

00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:20.226 position:50% align:center
Well! Let's turn it
into fertilizer!

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.437 position:50% align:center
It should be good for the soil!

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.191 position:50% align:center
[ROU stammering]
His efficiency is unbelievable!

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:30.403 position:50% align:center
[ROU grunts, screams]

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:34.282 position:50% align:center
[ZECHS] Hmph. This mission
was far too difficult

00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:37.077 position:50% align:center
for the violent woman
and obstructive elder.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.079 position:50% align:center
Know your enemy
like you know yourself

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:40.914 position:50% align:center
if you want to
achieve a victory.

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:45.085 position:50% align:center
Which is precisely why a little
research goes a long way.

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:49.756 position:50% align:center
Uh? Uh-- Wait. What's this?

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:52.759 position:50% align:center
Why isn't there a single shred
of information on this guy?

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:55.804 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see. I mistook
him as a beginner.

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:58.014 position:50% align:center
But seems he's played
this game before.

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50% align:center
Uh? This girl. Huh.

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:03.019 position:50% align:center
That's how it is...

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:08.441 position:50% align:center
A secret this juicy is begging
to be put on display!

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.410 position:50% align:center
[RANGA sighs]

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:21.955 position:50% align:center
Oh, so nice!

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:24.249 position:50% align:center
[ZECHS]
I'm glad to hear you say that.

00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:25.417 position:50% align:center
Who're you?

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.210 position:50% align:center
[ZECHS]
Oh, my apologies.

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:30.422 position:50% align:center
I am the Assistant Manager
of Finance, Zechs Haller.

00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:32.674 position:50% align:center
And I am pleased to
make your acquaintance.

00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:35.427 position:50% align:center
With that said, I came here
because I have a few questions

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.471 position:50% align:center
to ask you regarding your
personal data, young lady.

00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:40.056 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by "data"?

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.642 position:50% align:center
I think you know. Young lady.

00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:46.312 position:50% align:center
Your past is rather
extensive, isn't it?

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:47.772 position:50% align:center
I'm curious.

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:51.693 position:50% align:center
Have you reported to your
superiors about who you are?

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:54.154 position:50% align:center
Heh. I'll take that as a "no."

00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:57.824 position:50% align:center
Keep in mind the Three R's
must be adhered to.

00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:00.243 position:50% align:center
One person's mistake
could spell disaster

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:02.203 position:50% align:center
for an entire division
if they're not careful.

00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:04.956 position:50% align:center
Okay, so. What is it
you want from me?

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.126 position:50% align:center
Uh. Well, let's see.

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:10.837 position:50% align:center
Why don't you bow down
for me and then...

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.673 position:50% align:center
Um. What I meant to say
was I'd like to confirm

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:15.216 position:50% align:center
you're willing to apologize.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.344 position:50% align:center
To this camera, that is.

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:20.889 position:50% align:center
Now, then, be a good girl
and lift up your chin.

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:22.849 position:50% align:center
Squeeze your shoulders
in tight then remove

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:26.311 position:50% align:center
your towel and say you're
sorry, loud 'n' clear.

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:29.731 position:50% align:center
Uh--

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:35.070 position:50% align:center
She's a boy?!

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:37.530 position:50% align:center
So cute, yet... Wait.

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:39.657 position:50% align:center
Her being a him
is actually amazing!

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:41.701 position:50% align:center
Beyond amazing!

00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:44.621 position:50% align:center
Yes! He is a new pandora's box,

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:46.915 position:50% align:center
delivered by the
god of sexuality!

00:11:46.998 --> 00:11:49.542 position:50% align:center
The passion within me is
opening an enchanted door

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:53.380 position:50% align:center
that I'm being beckoned
to walk through.

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:58.385 position:50% align:center
[RIM] Meat! Meat! Meat!
Today, meat's on the menu!

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:00.053 position:50% align:center
[ZECHS screams]

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:03.348 position:50% align:center
This is inconceivable.

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:05.558 position:50% align:center
We are the Three Ravens
of the Demon Lord's Army,

00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:07.143 position:50% align:center
and yet we failed!

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:10.730 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Mic test, one, two. This
thing on? Can you three hear me?

00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:13.525 position:50% align:center
Huh?! What? General Ninomiya?

00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:14.901 position:50% align:center
Just wanna say thanks.

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:16.319 position:50% align:center
I've really enjoyed
the assignments

00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:17.529 position:50% align:center
you guys hooked me up with.

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:19.781 position:50% align:center
I could tell you put
some thought into them.

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:21.658 position:50% align:center
My position in the army
is secure now,

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:23.660 position:50% align:center
and that's largely due
to your machinations.

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.954 position:50% align:center
Wait, what're you
thanking us for?

00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:28.456 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] I knew if I did as I
pleased, it wouldn't be long

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.418 position:50% align:center
before the old guard
started gunning for me.

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:34.045 position:50% align:center
So I decided to take
advantage of that.

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:35.338 position:50% align:center
What a bummer, though!

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:36.840 position:50% align:center
I thought you were
supposed to be elite,

00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:38.758 position:50% align:center
but you came crashing down easy!

00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:41.678 position:50% align:center
So make sure you dust off your
chairs before you leave today.

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:45.140 position:50% align:center
Don't want my butt getting dirty
when it's my turn to sit'in'em.

00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:48.476 position:50% align:center
Bye, Three Morons!

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.355 position:50% align:center
[ROU growls] I'm trembling
from head to toe with fury!

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:55.525 position:50% align:center
Never in my centuries of life
have I experienced such shame!

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:58.319 position:50% align:center
We can't just let him get away
with saying that garbage!

00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:00.739 position:50% align:center
[ROU] It appears we have no
other choice than to throw

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:03.283 position:50% align:center
the impossible mission
at that degenerate!

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:05.160 position:50% align:center
Right! No way he could do that.

00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:07.996 position:50% align:center
But on the off chance that
he manages to prevail,

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:10.790 position:50% align:center
then he'd truly threaten our
positions, don't you think?

00:13:10.874 --> 00:13:15.337 position:50% align:center
[ROU spits] We Three Ravens
are birds of a feather,

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.798 position:50% align:center
and if we combine our strength,
there's no way we can lose!

00:13:18.882 --> 00:13:21.968 position:50% align:center
Let's just keep the Demon Lord
from finding out.

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:23.345 position:50% align:center
General Ninomiya!

00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:27.265 position:50% align:center
The well of your devil's
luck is about to run dry!

00:13:27.349 --> 00:13:29.726 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] And thus, the
battle for the self-interests

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:31.978 position:50% align:center
of the Special Executive
Benefit Fraternity,

00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:34.981 position:50% align:center
AKA the Three Ravens, begins!

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:37.442 position:50% align:center
Will the Ravens spread
their wings and fly?

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:40.695 position:50% align:center
Or is Kinji destined
to shoot them down?

00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:44.949 position:50% align:center
[RANGA grunting]

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:53.500 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. Where'd this
outfit come from?

00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:55.418 position:50% align:center
It's super cute!

00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:58.630 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Hey. Welcome back
to the land of the living.

00:13:58.713 --> 00:14:01.383 position:50% align:center
Oh! Ninomi-- Ew, gross!

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:04.219 position:50% align:center
Why, is something troubling
your adorable, purple head?

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:07.263 position:50% align:center
Whatever it is can wait for
we must hurry to the queen.

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:10.475 position:50% align:center
Time is certainly not something
we have very much of right now.

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:13.103 position:50% align:center
You said "queen,"
not "Demon Lord," right?

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:14.521 position:50% align:center
That's correct!

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:16.898 position:50% align:center
She grows more impatient
with each passing second,

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:18.858 position:50% align:center
so we really must be on our way!

00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:20.985 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:14:25.115 --> 00:14:29.327 position:50% align:center
Uh? Oh my gosh!

00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:31.204 position:50% align:center
Cutie patooties!

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:34.040 position:50% align:center
They're all just hopping
their little hearts out!

00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:35.792 position:50% align:center
Hello there, Mister Bunny.

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.752 position:50% align:center
What're you and
your friends doing?

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:39.254 position:50% align:center
[RABBIT A]
Work! What's it look like?

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:40.922 position:50% align:center
We have to turn these gears
to keep the water

00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:43.633 position:50% align:center
in the fountain at the
queen's castle flowing!

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:46.636 position:50% align:center
I see. Sounds like a tiring gig.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.054 position:50% align:center
[RABBIT A]
You're telling me!

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:51.725 position:50% align:center
But it is what it is.
We have to do it because...

00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:54.477 position:50% align:center
[RABBITS] We're the queen's
corporate grunts!

00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:57.355 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, that title's not
really something to brag about.

00:14:57.439 --> 00:14:59.399 position:50% align:center
[RABBIT A] Shut up!
The pretend pride we have

00:14:59.482 --> 00:15:01.317 position:50% align:center
in our work is the
only thing we got left!

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:03.069 position:50% align:center
We toil day and
night without rest

00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:04.320 position:50% align:center
and I haven't been
home in so long

00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:06.406 position:50% align:center
that I can't even
remember my wife's face!

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:07.949 position:50% align:center
[RABBIT B]
It's all the queen's fault.

00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:09.909 position:50% align:center
[RABBIT C] Which means
it's your fault, too!

00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:11.327 position:50% align:center
My fault?

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:14.247 position:50% align:center
[RABBIT A] And so go the tides
of corporate grunt-hood!

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.082 position:50% align:center
Give us overtime wages!

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:17.876 position:50% align:center
[RABBIT C]
We demand paid time off!

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:20.128 position:50% align:center
Um. I'm sorry,
but I'm not the one

00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:22.464 position:50% align:center
who can help you
with your grievances.

00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:26.384 position:50% align:center
Uh? Wait. Did I shrink?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I did.

00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:27.927 position:50% align:center

Charge!

Ranga, look!

00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:35.727 position:50% align:center
There's a hole that
we can escape through!

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:39.564 position:50% align:center
Yeah, good thinking, Ninomiya!

00:15:39.647 --> 00:15:41.358 position:50% align:center
[RANGA gasps]

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.781 position:50% align:center
Oh... That really hurt.

00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:50.867 position:50% align:center
Hello and welcome! Is this
your first time visiting?

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.120 position:50% align:center
Whoa! You're a mole!

00:15:54.204 --> 00:15:56.081 position:50% align:center
Wha...? Where am I now?

00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:57.999 position:50% align:center
This establishment
is the kingdom's

00:15:58.083 --> 00:15:59.501 position:50% align:center
underground internet café!

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:01.544 position:50% align:center
It's where all the people
who don't want to work

00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:03.129 position:50% align:center
for the queen go to hide.

00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:06.049 position:50% align:center
I guess you could say it's like
a private little town of losers.

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:07.592 position:50% align:center
Though, the longer
you stay here,

00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:08.968 position:50% align:center
the less inclined
you'll be to work,

00:16:09.052 --> 00:16:13.056 position:50% align:center
so let's proceed with
caution, shall we?

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:16.226 position:50% align:center
[COMPUTER A] Welcome! Let's
study the ecology of ants!

Did you know all
worker ants are female?

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.397 position:50% align:center
You didn't?

[RANGA giggles]

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:26.069 position:50% align:center
[COMPUTER A]
No! That's impossible!

00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:28.571 position:50% align:center
Man! That was worse
than I thought it'd be!

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:30.990 position:50% align:center
That's why I tried
to give you a heads up.

00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:32.951 position:50% align:center
Take a look around.

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:35.412 position:50% align:center
You'll see sluggish folks
like him everywhere

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:38.665 position:50% align:center
you turn down here.
No work. No goals.

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:40.542 position:50% align:center
Just repeating the
same mundane things

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:43.003 position:50% align:center
over and over with nothing
to live for at this point.

00:16:43.086 --> 00:16:45.714 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm not a fan of this place,

00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:48.091 position:50% align:center
but if the alternative is
working like those bunnies,

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:50.468 position:50% align:center
this has gotta be the
lesser of two evils.

00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:53.471 position:50% align:center
If I leave, it's hell,
but if I stay, I waste away.

00:16:53.555 --> 00:16:57.017 position:50% align:center
Ohh! I have no idea what to do!

Hey!

Run for your lives!

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.235 position:50% align:center

00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:10.530 position:50% align:center
[gasps] She's huge!

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:13.700 position:50% align:center
Since you elected to take your
sweet time in seeking me out,

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:16.119 position:50% align:center
I thought it best to go
looking for you instead.

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:17.579 position:50% align:center
Hoo-hoo!

00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:20.874 position:50% align:center
We're truly honored by such
dedication, Your Majesty.

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:22.834 position:50% align:center
Oh, jeez. Is this for real?

00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:26.046 position:50% align:center
Indeed. It's very real, Ranga.

00:17:26.129 --> 00:17:29.883 position:50% align:center
I, your ancestor Belza,
am the reigning queen.

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.259 position:50% align:center
[RANGA gasps]

00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:33.261 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you're
descended from Queen Belza!

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:34.971 position:50% align:center
I'm so jealous right now!

00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:37.724 position:50% align:center
I've been dying to
meet with you, my dear.

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:40.727 position:50% align:center
Well, the feeling isn't mutual,
just so you know!

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.228 position:50% align:center
You aren't happy to see me?

00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:44.022 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and you should know why!

00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:45.648 position:50% align:center
Because of what you did,
I've had to endure

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:47.942 position:50% align:center
hardship after hardship
my whole life!

00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:50.153 position:50% align:center
What other fate could there be
for the descendant of the witch

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:51.946 position:50% align:center
who caused the world to fall?

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.782 position:50% align:center
Because of you, my mom and dad--

00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:56.910 position:50% align:center
Died in sorrow and left you
with plenty of it, too?

00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:58.244 position:50% align:center
Is that about right?

00:17:58.328 --> 00:17:59.329 position:50% align:center
[RANGA gasps]

00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:03.041 position:50% align:center
Ranga, dear.
Think back for me now.

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:06.211 position:50% align:center
Remember how you and your
family were persecuted?

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:07.796 position:50% align:center
Forced to leave your birthplace

00:18:07.879 --> 00:18:11.925 position:50% align:center
for the sole reason of
being related to me.

00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:15.303 position:50% align:center
Remember how you spent
your days in a weary city?

00:18:15.387 --> 00:18:17.138 position:50% align:center
Hiding your secret
so you didn't meet

00:18:17.222 --> 00:18:20.100 position:50% align:center
the same end as your parents.

00:18:20.183 --> 00:18:22.894 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Yes. Of course I remember.

00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:25.146 position:50% align:center
That kinda tragedy
stays with you.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:28.358 position:50% align:center
It isn't some meaningless
memory that fades away!

00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:31.778 position:50% align:center
[BELZA] It must've been very
painful to live a lie like that.

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:33.822 position:50% align:center
And the cause of every
ounce of pain you suffered

00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:35.782 position:50% align:center
is none other than society.

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:38.368 position:50% align:center
There is no respite from the
stagnation and oppression

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:40.120 position:50% align:center
you've been overwhelmed with.

00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:42.580 position:50% align:center
So why not leave the remnants
of that life behind you

00:18:42.664 --> 00:18:45.041 position:50% align:center
and spend the rest of
your days here with me?

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:49.838 position:50% align:center
No. I could never
do that! Never ever!

00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:52.549 position:50% align:center
I have no desire
to live in this world,

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:55.135 position:50% align:center
because I know full well
this world's a dream.

00:18:55.218 --> 00:18:58.054 position:50% align:center
That's why... I need
to hurry and wake up!

00:18:58.138 --> 00:18:59.431 position:50% align:center
Even though it might be hard!

00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:01.433 position:50% align:center
[BELZA]
It's too late for that!

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:03.435 position:50% align:center
You can run away
like you always do,

00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:04.978 position:50% align:center
but sleeping or waking,

00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:07.397 position:50% align:center
this nightmare will follow you
as long as you draw breath.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.025 position:50% align:center
Maybe so. But still!

00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:12.193 position:50% align:center
I think it's about time
you accept the truth.

00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:14.904 position:50% align:center
The world out there has no
need for the likes of you.

00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:19.534 position:50% align:center
So throw it all aside
and stay here with me!

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:22.120 position:50% align:center
Um. Any bright ideas?

00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:23.997 position:50% align:center
Just one.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.249 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Huh?

00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:28.793 position:50% align:center
Let's do as she says
and live here with her!

00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:32.756 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.509 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Yeah, right!

00:19:36.593 --> 00:19:38.553 position:50% align:center
If that's honestly the
only idea you've got,

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:40.180 position:50% align:center
then you're sure as heck not me!

00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:42.057 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you're here.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.602 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Hey, Belza! Why are
you harping about oppression

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:49.439 position:50% align:center
and stagnation when you
wrote the book on both?

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:51.316 position:50% align:center
Ranga.

00:19:56.905 --> 00:20:00.825 position:50% align:center
Listen to me.
You need to snap out of it!

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:05.705 position:50% align:center
[RANGA screams] What did you
do that for, Ninomiya?

00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:07.874 position:50% align:center
To bring you back
from snooze city.

00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:10.335 position:50% align:center
Took a lot of time
and effort, you know.

00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:13.463 position:50% align:center
Huh? What are you
talking about?

00:20:14.798 --> 00:20:16.549 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
What is that?

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:20.303 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! It's starting
to come back to me.

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:22.389 position:50% align:center
We got a job from the
Demon Lord that brought us

00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:24.516 position:50% align:center
to the forest where we
came across that robot.

00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:27.060 position:50% align:center
Of course it picked a fight,
and in the middle of the battle,

00:20:27.143 --> 00:20:29.729 position:50% align:center
it shot some strange beam at me.

00:20:29.813 --> 00:20:33.191 position:50% align:center
That's when I suddenly
lost consciousness, I think.

00:20:33.274 --> 00:20:34.984 position:50% align:center
And had that dream.

00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:36.986 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] What's with this
mobile suit lookalike?

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.323 position:50% align:center
Does It have an androgynous,
pretty boy pilot?

00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:43.076 position:50% align:center
Welp! The moral is we
won and this guy lost!

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:44.869 position:50% align:center
Which means my promotion
to board member

00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:46.454 position:50% align:center
is all but certain now!

00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:47.664 position:50% align:center
Every step that I take

00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:50.041 position:50% align:center
is another step on the
road back to Japan!

00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:51.960 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:20:52.043 --> 00:20:53.712 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Hey, Ninomiya?

00:20:53.795 --> 00:20:55.213 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:57.632 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] I-I've been avoiding
and running away from things

00:20:57.716 --> 00:21:01.678 position:50% align:center
my entire life. Do you
think that's wrong?

00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:05.140 position:50% align:center
Huh? The hell are you talking
about, of course that's wrong.

00:21:05.223 --> 00:21:07.642 position:50% align:center
Ah. Okay cool.

00:21:07.726 --> 00:21:10.270 position:50% align:center
Though, with that said.
There are times when a

00:21:10.353 --> 00:21:14.024 position:50% align:center
"strategic retreat"
is the smart call.

00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:16.109 position:50% align:center
As long as you safely
reach your goal,

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:19.696 position:50% align:center
you can hold your head high,
even knowing you fled before.

00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:22.824 position:50% align:center
A temporary escape for
the sake of future victory!

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:25.160 position:50% align:center
And if anybody gives
you grief about it,

00:21:25.243 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center
just give 'em a boot to
the back of the head.

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:32.125 position:50% align:center
Got it? That goes for
both commoners and queens.

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:38.882 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:43.470 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Ninomiya. Thanks a lot!

00:21:46.348 --> 00:21:50.143 position:50% align:center
[KINJI laughs] We finally get
to meet the Demon Lord

00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:54.564 position:50% align:center
face to face. Sure made me
bust my butt for it, though!

00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:57.025 position:50% align:center
Please excuse us!

00:22:00.904 --> 00:22:03.448 position:50% align:center
[DEMON LORD]
I've been expecting you.

00:22:03.531 --> 00:22:05.658 position:50% align:center
I take it you're
the Demon Lord?

00:22:05.742 --> 00:22:10.246 position:50% align:center
Ninomiya. I have a favor
I'd like to request.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.459 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:17.128 position:50% align:center
It's a trivial little thing.

00:22:17.212 --> 00:22:19.923 position:50% align:center
I just want you to
save the world.
