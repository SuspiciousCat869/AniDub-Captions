[ALUS] Everyone!
Charge with all you have!

[BOSS MONSTER A growls]

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.101 position:50% align:center
[BODYGUARD A]
Nope, nope, nope!

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.854 position:50% align:center
[ALUS] The ruins that Lady
Belza seeks are close!

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:23.189 position:50% align:center
So, stand your ground
and fight for your lives!

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:25.650 position:50% align:center
[BODYGUARDS scream]

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:27.027 position:50% align:center
[BODYGUARD B groans]

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.987 position:50% align:center
How truly pathetic.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.699 position:50% align:center
We're the Bodyguards--
the strongest warriors!

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:38.705 position:50% align:center
Now's not the time
to lose focus!

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:40.123 position:50% align:center
[RIM yells]

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:43.626 position:50% align:center
[BOSS MONSTER A roars]

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.171 position:50% align:center
[ALUS gasping]

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:51.843 position:50% align:center
Everyone present
and accounted for?

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:53.845 position:50% align:center
Fall back to the
fourth level if so!

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:55.972 position:50% align:center
This rescue mission's
not over yet!

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.682 position:50% align:center
[RESCUE TEAM]
Right!

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:04.397 position:50% align:center
[ALUS] Let go of me!
I am the elite Alus Vi Alstein!

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:07.275 position:50% align:center
And I say halt! We have to
see the task at hand through!

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:10.403 position:50% align:center
As the Bodyguards' leader,
it's my sworn duty!

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:12.197 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Sworn duty, my butt!

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.741 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and die here if you
want! But leave those

00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:17.410 position:50% align:center
who'd rather live out
of your suicide mission!

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:19.454 position:50% align:center
I would've thought even a
loser like you would learn

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:21.748 position:50% align:center
from this failure,
not repeat the same mistake

00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:23.667 position:50% align:center
five seconds later!

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.379 position:50% align:center
What? How dare you!
I am not a loser!

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:30.215 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Fair. I admit your perseverance

00:01:30.298 --> 00:01:34.052 position:50% align:center
in a crummy situation's
pretty admirable.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.973 position:50% align:center
You've done well to
make it this far,

00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:41.434 position:50% align:center
but you can leave
the rest to me.

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:43.269 position:50% align:center
[ALUS gasping]

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:55.156 position:50% align:center
[ALUS] My encounter with
Kinji Ninomiya was as sudden

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.077 position:50% align:center
as it was shocking.
He reassured those in fear.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.579 position:50% align:center
Stood by those
who were concerned.

00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:04.666 position:50% align:center
Ultimately, he raised the
morale of all the troops.

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:09.295 position:50% align:center
And his plans for moving deeper
into the dungeon were made real.

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.756 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
Fist of doom!

00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:16.845 position:50% align:center
[BODYGUARDS cheer]

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:20.390 position:50% align:center
So, tell me.
I'm grateful and all,

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:23.935 position:50% align:center
but is helping us out not
extremely inconvenient for you?

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.023 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] I'm not doing it for you
guys. This benefits our friend.

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:30.400 position:50% align:center
She's in a lot of
pain right now.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:32.485 position:50% align:center
For a friend?

00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:34.612 position:50% align:center
[ALUS]
Come to think of it,

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:36.990 position:50% align:center
my devotion to Lady
Belza was so strong,

00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:40.702 position:50% align:center
I never paid heed to anything
else, red flags included.

00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:46.666 position:50% align:center
[ALUS]
I get it now.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.128 position:50% align:center
It's people like him who
are truly fit to lead.

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:01.389 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] We have one goal here
and you know what it is!

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:03.266 position:50% align:center
If we're gonna stop those
Guardians from being

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.811 position:50% align:center
mass-produced, we need
to destroy the ruins! Alus.

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:08.772 position:50% align:center
Um... Yes? What's wrong?

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:13.485 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to apologize,
I shouldn't have hit you.

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:15.528 position:50% align:center
I figured with skin
as soft as yours,

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:17.781 position:50% align:center
you'd bruise like a peach.

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:23.495 position:50% align:center
That's a little too friendly!
And truth be told,

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:26.164 position:50% align:center
I trust you about as far
as I can throw you.

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:29.501 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Hmph. I'm sorry to
hear you feel that way.

00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:35.173 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] Why did he do that
in front of everyone?

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:37.717 position:50% align:center
Dramatic displays are
pretty standard for him.

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:39.302 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'll give you that.

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:42.305 position:50% align:center
I'm also willing to bet it has
to do with his latest scheme.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.975 position:50% align:center
Now! Let's get this show
on the road! Follow me!

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.061 position:50% align:center
[BODYGUARDS yell]

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:50.271 position:50% align:center
[ALUS] What happened next
was breathtaking...

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:53.525 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Raid squad! Lure the
big ones off to the sides!

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:55.318 position:50% align:center
Spread these oversized
eyesores out

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:58.196 position:50% align:center
and punch through till
we reach the ruins!

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:05.036 position:50% align:center
Right flank! Target the
frontlines and fire at will!

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.375 position:50% align:center
Biceps-for-brains squad
should focus on the enemies

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:12.502 position:50% align:center
directly in front of me
to secure our advance.

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:13.586 position:50% align:center
Sound doable?

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.257 position:50% align:center
Why's my squad's name
so derogatory?!

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.967 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE laughs]

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.386 position:50% align:center
[SHIA yells]

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.054 position:50% align:center
[BOSS MONSTER B growls]

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:24.931 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE gasping]

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:30.520 position:50% align:center
All right, Rim! Make it count!

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.814 position:50% align:center
Prepare to feel
all of my emotions!

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:37.027 position:50% align:center
Through my fist! Super punch!

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.696 position:50% align:center
Now try a super kick!

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:55.128 position:50% align:center
[ALUS] We actually won.
What a man.

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:59.382 position:50% align:center
Those Guardians were almost the
death of my entire regiment.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.926 position:50% align:center
Yet he obliterated them.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.303 position:50% align:center
It's as if his light

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:05.847 position:50% align:center
banished the shadow
of my incompetence.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.724 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
We did it, Alus!

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.684 position:50% align:center
This victory would have
never been possible

00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:13.480 position:50% align:center
if not for your valiant efforts.
So, thanks!

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:15.774 position:50% align:center
Oh. You're welcome.

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:17.859 position:50% align:center
--[ANT A] Mister Ninomiya!
--[KINJI] Yeah?

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:19.903 position:50% align:center
[ANT A] I bring news from
the fourth floor.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:23.990 position:50% align:center
Lady Sky's health has improved,
she's stabilizing!

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:27.952 position:50% align:center
[KINJI gasps]
You hear that, Rim? Nice work!

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:30.330 position:50% align:center
[BODYGUARD C]
I have an update, too!

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:32.874 position:50% align:center
A group of us found a
door to the sixth floor!

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:35.669 position:50% align:center
Great! Lead the way!

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:47.389 position:50% align:center
That's it. The power
Lady Belza's been seeking.

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:49.891 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] Proceed carefully.
This force

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:53.311 position:50% align:center
is unlike anything I've
ever felt in my life.

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:56.856 position:50% align:center
Well, in that case stand back.
If it's as dangerous as you say,

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.317 position:50% align:center
then the only one
getting near it is me.

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:00.568 position:50% align:center
[BODYGUARD D]
Whoa.

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:02.821 position:50% align:center
[BODYGUARD E] This guy's
got some serious guts.

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:05.365 position:50% align:center
[BODYGUARD F]
The paragon of bravery!

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:10.870 position:50% align:center
[BODYGUARDS]
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go...

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:15.291 position:50% align:center
[ALUS] Oh, Ninomiya.
If only I had met you sooner.

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:16.751 position:50% align:center
[BODYGUARDS]
Ninomiya! Ninomiya...

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:17.836 position:50% align:center
[ALUS]
Perhaps I would have led

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.672 position:50% align:center
a very different
life than this one.

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:25.385 position:50% align:center
[BODYGUARDS]
Ninomiya! Ninomiya...

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:28.096 position:50% align:center
Miss Shia! Come on!
It's not that emotional!

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:30.890 position:50% align:center
It's just really moving to
see someone as selfish as him

00:06:30.974 --> 00:06:34.185 position:50% align:center
volunteer to go first for
the safety of his troops!

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center
I had so many doubts
about his humanity,

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:39.274 position:50% align:center
but I still believed deep
down he was good!

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:41.860 position:50% align:center
Vindication!

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:46.072 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
Uh, let's wait and see.

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:49.784 position:50% align:center
[BODYGUARDS]
Ninomiya! Ninomiya!

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.505 position:50% align:center
[KINJI laughing]

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:13.099 position:50% align:center
I owe all of you
a tremendous debt.

00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:14.517 position:50% align:center
What? And why is that?

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:16.770 position:50% align:center
I think he activated
the artifact!

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:20.190 position:50% align:center
What is the meaning
of this, Ninomiya?

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.484 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Heh. You wanna know?

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
I already scouted the fifth
floor long before I showed up

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:28.907 position:50% align:center
and rescued you and
your men's sorry hides.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.787 position:50% align:center
Even with Rim and
Shia in our ranks,

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.664 position:50% align:center
there's no way we'll
survive a fight head-on.

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:38.958 position:50% align:center
Hm? What's that?

00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:41.711 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING]
If you mean those pillars,

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:43.630 position:50% align:center
they're part of a
"Management Manipulator"

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:46.007 position:50% align:center
built about
45 hundred years ago.

00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:48.677 position:50% align:center
What else can you tell me
about it, you beautiful genius?

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.512 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING] There's a high
probability this is what

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:53.723 position:50% align:center
the surplus of Guardians
is stemming from.

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:56.601 position:50% align:center
If you can connect me with a
device that has a higher command

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:59.813 position:50% align:center
authority, I should be able to
afford you complete control

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:02.565 position:50% align:center
over a significant portion
of the dungeon's power.

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:07.028 position:50% align:center
Excellent.
Seems destiny's on my side!

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:14.536 position:50% align:center
[BODYGUARDS grunting]

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:17.080 position:50% align:center
[KINJI laughs]

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.873 position:50% align:center
Behold a force
the likes of which

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:22.335 position:50% align:center
you'll never see replicated!

00:08:22.419 --> 00:08:25.422 position:50% align:center
Shout out to all my pawns
who made this happen!

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:28.216 position:50% align:center
I mean this with the utmost
sincerity when I say

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:29.592 position:50% align:center
I couldn't have done
this without you!

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:34.139 position:50% align:center
[ALUS] Wh-What? So,
this was your plan? All along?

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:36.474 position:50% align:center
And you fell for it so easily.

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:40.562 position:50% align:center
[ALUS gasps]

00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:42.355 position:50% align:center
This is a bit much,
even for you!

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:45.025 position:50% align:center
Just what do you intend to do
with this newfound power?

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:47.068 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] I told you before
our crew came down here

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:48.653 position:50% align:center
I was gonna put it to good use,

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:50.780 position:50% align:center
and that was as true
then as it is now!

00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:52.532 position:50% align:center
Come on, Wanibe.

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:55.201 position:50% align:center
You already know if I want
something I get it!

00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:57.412 position:50% align:center
And now, I've met my objective,

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.497 position:50% align:center
and while I may have deceived

and the monsters because of her
poor dungeon management.

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:22.469 position:50% align:center
Instead, she abused
the power of the ruins

why she failed.

the obvious perks,

Ah. Well, good for you.

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:55.877 position:50% align:center
For instance, I learned mana
circulating in the dungeons

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.962 position:50% align:center
is supplemented by
what's in those who visit,

00:13:58.046 --> 00:13:59.839 position:50% align:center
and if dungeons can't
harvest that mana,

00:13:59.923 --> 00:14:00.882 position:50% align:center
they turn dormant.

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:02.133 position:50% align:center

our budding company becomes.

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:13.395 position:50% align:center
People have fun and
the dungeons get fed.

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:15.021 position:50% align:center
Which also feeds us in a way.

00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:18.983 position:50% align:center
It's a tourist trap,

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:21.486 position:50% align:center
but it's a safe asset
management system.

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:22.821 position:50% align:center
That, dear Ranga,

00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:25.323 position:50% align:center
is the true nature of this

00:16:14.557 --> 00:16:17.227 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasping]

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.021 position:50% align:center
[RAAHAN] The price of demonite
has dropped through the floor!

00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:21.439 position:50% align:center
Those numbers don't lie.

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:23.942 position:50% align:center
The market's currently flooded
with premium demonite!

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:25.568 position:50% align:center
[BELZA]
Seems he's ignoring the cartel

00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:28.655 position:50% align:center
and selling it directly to
the public at economy prices.

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:33.159 position:50% align:center
And by "he" I of course mean
that smarmy pain in the--

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:36.955 position:50% align:center
[ANT QUEEN] Raiza'ha was really
mistreating its distribution

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:39.749 position:50% align:center
and sales subcontractors,
so getting them to join us

00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:41.960 position:50% align:center
was as easy as saying, "please."

00:16:42.043 --> 00:16:44.254 position:50% align:center
We now have over 50%
of the market share

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:47.132 position:50% align:center
and it's showing
no signs of dropping.

00:16:47.215 --> 00:16:49.050 position:50% align:center
Nice. Very nice.

00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:51.886 position:50% align:center
At this rate I wouldn't be
surprised if I'm controlling

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:56.349 position:50% align:center
the entire demonite market
this time tomorrow! Heh.

00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:58.435 position:50% align:center
Let's initiate phase two.

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:00.562 position:50% align:center
[SECRETARY A]
Am I missing something here?

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:03.773 position:50% align:center
Why isn't there a single
customer in the store?

00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:05.358 position:50% align:center
Well, you see. A company called

00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:07.652 position:50% align:center
"Ninomiya Delivery Service"
started a new thing

00:17:07.736 --> 00:17:09.362 position:50% align:center
where you can order
goods via a catalogue

00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:12.365 position:50% align:center
and have them delivered
to you the same day.

00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:14.576 position:50% align:center
[CLERK A] It's so convenient all
of our regulars switched over

00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:19.914 position:50% align:center
to using that. Oh, speak of
the devil! There they go now!

00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:23.960 position:50% align:center
[SECRETARY A]
What in the world?

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:26.212 position:50% align:center
[CINDY] When you have as much
demonite as Mister Ninomiya,

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:29.758 position:50% align:center
why not also develop your own
privately branded goods?

00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:31.926 position:50% align:center
[STAFF A] Packages three
through six are handled!

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.221 position:50% align:center
[STAFF B] Teleporting
westward-bound sets now!

00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:38.141 position:50% align:center
[CINDY] Using the dungeon's
teleportation devices is smart.

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:40.268 position:50% align:center
Then the monsters
finish the job.

00:17:40.352 --> 00:17:42.187 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.272 position:50% align:center
[CINDY] Never would've thought
of using a dungeon like this,

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:47.567 position:50% align:center
that's for sure.
But I didn't have to.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.737 position:50% align:center
Mister Ninomiya's mind has
brought my shop to new heights!

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.198 position:50% align:center
I owe that
brilliant man my life!

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:56.743 position:50% align:center
[BELZA] Are you kidding?
He took a 40% share

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:59.496 position:50% align:center
in the magical items market
practically overnight?

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.206 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid so.

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:03.375 position:50% align:center
[BELZA] First, we must win
back the sales numbers.

00:18:03.458 --> 00:18:05.460 position:50% align:center
Focus on quantity over quality.

00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:08.254 position:50% align:center
If he can mass-produce junk
and pass it off as decent,

00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:09.923 position:50% align:center
then so can Raiza'ha!

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:12.300 position:50% align:center
Well, now that you mention it...

00:18:12.384 --> 00:18:14.260 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Not too shabby, Wanibe.

00:18:14.344 --> 00:18:16.304 position:50% align:center
Thanks to your extensive
demonite research,

00:18:16.388 --> 00:18:18.181 position:50% align:center
I can deliver safe and
high-quality goods

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:20.308 position:50% align:center
to our consumers
all over the planet.

00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:22.268 position:50% align:center
Sorry if this comes
off a bit harsh,

00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:24.104 position:50% align:center
but I was really surprised
that quality

00:18:24.187 --> 00:18:25.897 position:50% align:center
was one of your main concerns.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.899 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] No, I get it.
It was never my goal

00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:30.443 position:50% align:center
to flood the market with
more trash demonite.

00:18:30.527 --> 00:18:34.406 position:50% align:center
Reformation is something that
must be done from the core.

00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:36.950 position:50% align:center
I know it's a little late to
check-in for the first time,

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:38.660 position:50% align:center
but are you okay with this?

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:40.704 position:50% align:center
I did kind of force you
to follow me.

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:42.539 position:50% align:center
And now you're wondering
if I'm all right

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:45.000 position:50% align:center
with how you tricked me into
joining your crazy schemes?

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:46.793 position:50% align:center
I probably would've
left Raiza'ha anyway

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:50.588 position:50% align:center
since I felt like I could
accomplish something with you.

00:18:50.672 --> 00:18:53.133 position:50% align:center
Could you give Shia a lesson
or two in open-mindedness

00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:54.884 position:50% align:center
when you get the chance?

00:18:54.968 --> 00:18:56.469 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
It was unfortunate,

00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:59.889 position:50% align:center
but her resolve's part of what
makes her such a good person.

00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:05.437 position:50% align:center
Look at you, mister front page.
I'm happy for you.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.772 position:50% align:center
Well, if you're gonna
follow your own path,

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
it'd be silly for me
not to follow mine.

00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:11.860 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Listen monsters one and all!

00:19:11.943 --> 00:19:14.612 position:50% align:center
I will repeat this as
many times as needed!

00:19:14.696 --> 00:19:17.032 position:50% align:center
The era of dungeon raiding
has come to an end!

00:19:17.115 --> 00:19:19.701 position:50% align:center
From this day forward,
humans and demihumans

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:21.411 position:50% align:center
will live hand in hand
with monsters!

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:23.913 position:50% align:center
And with this new age
comes a new model

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:25.457 position:50% align:center
of the Dungeon Black Company!

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.418 position:50% align:center
No longer will you be
hunted by adventurers!

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:30.920 position:50% align:center
In fact, I have a new
concept for you.

00:19:31.004 --> 00:19:33.048 position:50% align:center
Why not put the squeeze
on them instead?

00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:34.591 position:50% align:center
Challenge them as equals!

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:37.469 position:50% align:center
Show them monsters have every
right to be on the surface!

00:19:37.552 --> 00:19:39.512 position:50% align:center
Cause you do! You know you do!

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:41.765 position:50% align:center
Those who are going to write
the next page in history

00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:44.100 position:50% align:center
are the creatures gathered
in this very room!

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:47.103 position:50% align:center
[MONSTERS cheer]

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.316 position:50% align:center
[KINJI chuckles]
That's the stuff.

00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:53.360 position:50% align:center
They can do whatever
they want to,

00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:57.739 position:50% align:center
as long as it's in
the palm of my hand!

00:19:57.822 --> 00:19:59.616 position:50% align:center
Don't let me down, guys.

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:03.453 position:50% align:center
Provide me with a life
of eternal stability!

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:13.797 position:50% align:center
[BELZA] Unbelievable!
All the pillars of my company.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.467 position:50% align:center
Exploration, gathering,
transportation,

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.136 position:50% align:center
sales, and research.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.389 position:50% align:center
I've lost in every
miserable way a person

00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:23.515 position:50% align:center
can possibly lose.

00:20:23.598 --> 00:20:25.725 position:50% align:center
What a shocking turn
of events, eh?

00:20:25.809 --> 00:20:28.186 position:50% align:center
Even my boss is talking about
making arrangements

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:31.773 position:50% align:center
to team up and start a new
enterprise with that guy.

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:34.526 position:50% align:center
Said he was awe-struck by
that sleazeball's techniques

00:20:34.609 --> 00:20:37.570 position:50% align:center
and ideology, or something.

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:42.200 position:50% align:center
That is the absolute last thing
I wanna hear right now!

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:46.371 position:50% align:center
[BELZA gasping]
I'm going home.

00:20:46.454 --> 00:20:52.168 position:50% align:center
Huh?! Hey, wait.
Drinking alone's no fun!

00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:53.420 position:50% align:center
[BARTENDER A sighs]

00:20:53.503 --> 00:20:56.006 position:50% align:center
That stupid Kinji Ninomiya
grates every nerve

00:20:56.089 --> 00:20:59.384 position:50% align:center
in my body. The power
hidden away in those ruins

00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:01.678 position:50% align:center
was supposed to be mine.

00:21:03.555 --> 00:21:07.017 position:50% align:center
[BELZA]
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.061 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] I think it's about time
you threw in the towel.

00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:13.231 position:50% align:center
[BELZA gasps]

00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:15.150 position:50% align:center
You'll never obtain the
power of the dungeon,

00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:17.193 position:50% align:center
so you might as well give up.

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:20.071 position:50% align:center
Ninomiya's got you beat.
Face it.

00:21:20.155 --> 00:21:21.781 position:50% align:center
And who are you
supposed to be?

00:21:21.865 --> 00:21:23.491 position:50% align:center
Someone who knows
all about your past

00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:25.827 position:50% align:center
and how nobody cared
to show you love.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:28.538 position:50% align:center
As an illegitimate child of
the noble Shuba'ha family,

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:31.624 position:50% align:center
you had no choice but to
do everything yourself.

00:21:31.708 --> 00:21:33.209 position:50% align:center
What is this nonsense?

00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:36.087 position:50% align:center
I may be drunk but I'm
not that drunk, kiddo!

00:21:36.171 --> 00:21:37.922 position:50% align:center
You've never trusted
or shown affection

00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:40.383 position:50% align:center
to a soul in your life,
and you never will.

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:42.218 position:50% align:center
All you can do is deny, reject,

00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:45.221 position:50% align:center
and break everything you
come into contact with.

00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:49.559 position:50% align:center
And those broken by you grow to
hate every fiber of your being.

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:51.728 position:50% align:center
Whether you're an alcohol
induced hallucination

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:54.272 position:50% align:center
or a real person...

00:21:54.356 --> 00:21:58.777 position:50% align:center
Stop talking about me like
you know my entire life story!

00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:09.788 position:50% align:center
That must be what a final inning
homerun feels like! Score!

00:22:09.871 --> 00:22:11.289 position:50% align:center
[FAU laughing]

00:22:11.373 --> 00:22:13.583 position:50% align:center
[BELZA growls]
You brat!

00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:16.086 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] For what it's worth, I
was pretty set in my ways, too.

00:22:16.169 --> 00:22:19.172 position:50% align:center
But meeting Ninomiya can really
change you if you let it.

00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:24.552 position:50% align:center
You know, Belza, all it takes
is one good decision!

00:22:24.636 --> 00:22:29.099 position:50% align:center
[BELZA] Yeah! You better leave
while your face is intact!

00:22:29.182 --> 00:22:32.143 position:50% align:center
That kid totally owned you!

00:22:32.227 --> 00:22:34.813 position:50% align:center
--[FAU yelps]
--Huh?

00:22:46.658 --> 00:22:50.120 position:50% align:center
[BELZA laughs]

00:22:50.203 --> 00:22:51.996 position:50% align:center
[FAU]
Eh?

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.875 position:50% align:center
My mind was just blessed
with the most glorious idea!
