[REPORTER A]
Hey, get your camera ready!

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.515 position:50% align:center
I can see some people
heading toward the exit!

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:17.976 position:50% align:center
On this ninth of
November at 9:50 AM,

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:19.769 position:50% align:center
the rising tycoon,
Kinji Ninomiya,

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.604 position:50% align:center
has been placed under arrest!

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:25.900 position:50% align:center
[REPORTER A]
His crime:

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:28.528 position:50% align:center
violating the demonite
exchange law.

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:31.239 position:50% align:center
No. This is bad.

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:32.949 position:50% align:center
"Bad" is an understatement.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:37.245 position:50% align:center
This is life-ending! I mean,
he's going to jail!

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:44.419 position:50% align:center
[JOURNALIST A] Raiza'ha
has reportedly suffered

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:46.588 position:50% align:center
enormous financial
losses as a result

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:48.965 position:50% align:center
of Mister Ninomiya's
business practices.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.675 position:50% align:center
I'm rather curious
to know your take

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:52.969 position:50% align:center
on the allegations he's facing.

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:55.263 position:50% align:center
We believe that
every claim is true.

00:00:55.347 --> 00:00:57.724 position:50% align:center
Our evidence suggests the
"Dungeon Black Company"

00:00:57.807 --> 00:01:00.018 position:50% align:center
he manages used
illegal means to reach

00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:04.230 position:50% align:center
previously unexplored floors
in a dungeon owned by Raiza'ha.

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:06.107 position:50% align:center
There, he proceeded
to loot our demonite

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:08.151 position:50% align:center
right from under our noses.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.403 position:50% align:center
In fact, while he was still
employed with Raiza'ha,

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:12.405 position:50% align:center
he used several
unscrupulous methods

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:14.324 position:50% align:center
to improve his
performance metrics.

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:18.161 position:50% align:center
But why not let two of his
many victims tell you more.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:21.706 position:50% align:center
Mister Ninomiya used
a sleepwalker staff

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.042 position:50% align:center
on me and his fellow employees
without a license

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:26.878 position:50% align:center
and forced us to work ourselves
so hard and for so long that

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:29.839 position:50% align:center
I still have nightmares
about it to this day.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.424 position:50% align:center
I've been wronged, too!

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:35.178 position:50% align:center
I was nice and lent him money,
but he never repaid any of it!

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:38.890 position:50% align:center
Then this one time, he took me
down a dark alleyway and, well,

00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:41.851 position:50% align:center
I thought I could say it
out loud, but I can't!

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.978 position:50% align:center
[BELZA] It truly is most
unfortunate that someone

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:46.398 position:50% align:center
who once represented our
proud and noble company

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:48.733 position:50% align:center
has turned out to be
such a dastardly crook.

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:50.443 position:50% align:center
However, we would
also like to mention

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:52.237 position:50% align:center
that we were only
successful in uncovering

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.988 position:50% align:center
the truth about
Ninomiya's misdeeds

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:55.573 position:50% align:center
thanks to Raiza'ha's very own

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:59.369 position:50% align:center
second coming of the hero,
Miss Kinou Shia.

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:00.912 position:50% align:center
I'll be blunt.

00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:03.665 position:50% align:center
I'd like you to spearhead our
efforts to thwart Ninomiya.

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:05.417 position:50% align:center
Wait! Why me, though?

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.919 position:50% align:center
As I'm sure you know, a large
portion of our employees

00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:09.587 position:50% align:center
have been forced
to work elsewhere.

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:10.839 position:50% align:center
We have little choice since

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:13.842 position:50% align:center
the Black Company
keeps taking their jobs.

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:16.553 position:50% align:center
A selfish dictator like Ninomiya
will never comprehend

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:19.222 position:50% align:center
the sorrow he sows by
uprooting the everyday lives

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:22.892 position:50% align:center
of common workers
and their families.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:26.604 position:50% align:center
But not you.
You understand that full well.

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:28.106 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:40.243 position:50% align:center
[BELZA laughs]

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:42.287 position:50% align:center
Ninomiya has resorted
to using monsters

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.872 position:50% align:center
for manual labor,
which is causing

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:47.042 position:50% align:center
the human job market
to plummet dramatically.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:49.210 position:50% align:center
You may recall a similar
system being utilized

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:52.172 position:50% align:center
by the "Demon Lord"
described in literature.

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:56.343 position:50% align:center
He's no mere criminal. He's
a threat to our whole society.

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:09.981 position:50% align:center
Belza sure means business when
she plans to take you down!

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:11.775 position:50% align:center
And her plan's
not hard to guess.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:12.859 position:50% align:center
They're going to apply

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:15.070 position:50% align:center
the Threat to Humanity
Law on Ninomiya.

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:16.571 position:50% align:center
What law is that?

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:18.656 position:50% align:center
A very outdated,
inquisition-style

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.117 position:50% align:center
way of imposing penalties
to wrongdoers.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:24.537 position:50% align:center
One in which basic human rights
aren't exactly factored in.

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:28.124 position:50% align:center
His fate'll be sealed if it
comes to that. We have to act.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.168 position:50% align:center
Right! But what can we do?

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:31.836 position:50% align:center
[ANT QUEEN]
Ah, there you are.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.588 position:50% align:center
I didn't know you
were looking for us.

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.799 position:50% align:center
I'm here to tell you I found it.

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.634 position:50% align:center
Wait, did you really?

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:45.600 position:50% align:center
[SARI laughs] I gotta hand it to
you. That magic-canceling suit

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:48.144 position:50% align:center
fits you in all the
right places, huh?

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.522 position:50% align:center
Can't have you working your
magic in here, especially

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:54.150 position:50% align:center
the kind thought to make
demonite by feeding off clients.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.403 position:50% align:center
You also used certain
items without a license

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:57.904 position:50% align:center
and even caused property damage

00:03:57.987 --> 00:04:01.616 position:50% align:center
by recklessly
teleporting the Majin.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.952 position:50% align:center
It's written all over
your face, you know?

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:07.747 position:50% align:center
How guilty you are.
Oh, yes. I can tell.

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.959 position:50% align:center
I'm sure the truth will
come out soon enough.

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:12.210 position:50% align:center
But here's a thought!

00:04:12.293 --> 00:04:14.754 position:50% align:center
Why not just spill your
guts to me here and now?

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.339 position:50% align:center
It may even lighten
your punishment

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:18.425 position:50% align:center
a little bit if you do!

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:22.804 position:50% align:center
Ahh. Not up for a chat?

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:25.348 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.434 position:50% align:center
[SARI] You can drop
the cool-guy facade.

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
It won't work on me,

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:31.104 position:50% align:center
because I'm a special
threat investigator.

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:33.064 position:50% align:center
Which means I'm permitted
to use any means,

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:37.569 position:50% align:center
and I do mean any means,
necessary to expose the truth.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:44.159 position:50% align:center
This assignment's got me
all kinds of giddy already

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:48.371 position:50% align:center
and we've only just
begun! [laughing]

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.002 position:50% align:center
[BELZA]
Well, Miss Sari. How is he?

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.920 position:50% align:center
I can't see a fool
like him maintaining

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.589 position:50% align:center
his silence for very long.

00:04:57.672 --> 00:05:00.842 position:50% align:center
Turns out he's a resilient fool,
which is just my type.

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:04.012 position:50% align:center
I'd like to keep him for
as long as I possibly can.

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:05.972 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid that's
too good for him.

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:07.390 position:50% align:center
That man inflicted pain on me

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.726 position:50% align:center
the likes of which
I've never felt before.

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.770 position:50% align:center
If he doesn't spend the rest
of his life crawling through

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:15.273 position:50% align:center
trash heaps, there is
no justice in this world.

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:18.276 position:50% align:center
[SHIA gasps]
Mister Ninomiya.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.861 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Shia?

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:23.740 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you're in pain.
Here, I'll use healing magic.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:25.408 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
You idiot.

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:30.205 position:50% align:center
Have you ever heard of
being guilty by association?

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:38.254 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry. You're
locked up because of me.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.840 position:50% align:center
Don't remember you
dragging me in here.

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:44.386 position:50% align:center
Not directly. But actions were
taken because of what I said.

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.721 position:50% align:center
As a hero, I wanted
to help everyone.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:51.351 position:50% align:center
To ensure they didn't go through
the same hardship I suffered.

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.228 position:50% align:center
And yet, the justice I
sought was the kind

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:55.146 position:50% align:center
where someone got hurt anyway.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.359 position:50% align:center
All I was trying to do was
fight for what I believe in.

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:06.116 position:50% align:center
If you want my forgiveness,
it's yours.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.201 position:50% align:center
We've clashed
since we first met.

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:10.370 position:50% align:center
But that's to be expected
when people have things

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:11.913 position:50% align:center
they can't give up on.

00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:14.416 position:50% align:center
But to me, the weak people
you try so desperately

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:17.252 position:50% align:center
to protect are poisonous.

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:18.670 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:21.506 position:50% align:center
I define others as weak,
because it lets me delude myself

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:23.675 position:50% align:center
into thinking that
I'm so much better.

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:25.051 position:50% align:center
Which is what has
stripped my heart

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
of the will to fight for them.

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:29.848 position:50% align:center
I made a choice and I
chose to be untouchable

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:31.433 position:50% align:center
as opposed to being relatable.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:35.311 position:50% align:center
So simply sticking to the
status quo just won't fly.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:36.938 position:50% align:center
There are enemies everywhere,

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:40.150 position:50% align:center
and a strong person isn't
merely someone with power.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.068 position:50% align:center
Those who know how
to gain more power

00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:43.862 position:50% align:center
are the truly strong.

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:46.114 position:50% align:center
They're the kinds of people
who are sharpening their skills

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:49.200 position:50% align:center
in the shadows while the
weak struggle to catch up.

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:51.911 position:50% align:center
I knew in order to overturn
that reality I needed

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:53.997 position:50% align:center
the will to keep
pushing forward.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.958 position:50% align:center
A desire that never burns out!

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:01.338 position:50% align:center
This is nothing close to defeat.

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.798 position:50% align:center
Not until my will
is reduced to ashes.

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.509 position:50% align:center
[ATTENDEES chattering]

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:14.726 position:50% align:center
Well, aren't you
looking gorgeous tonight.

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:17.103 position:50% align:center
[BELZA] You're too kind,
Director Johari.

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:20.190 position:50% align:center
[JOHARI] Then again, you're
always ravishing, Belza.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.941 position:50% align:center
Why don't you just quit your job

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:24.486 position:50% align:center
and become my
secretary instead, eh?

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:27.447 position:50% align:center
Now, now, sir.
You know I like my job.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.741 position:50% align:center
Are you getting good
and drunk, my friends?

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:32.077 position:50% align:center
It's a party, after all!

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.205 position:50% align:center
I think you've consumed enough
drinks for all three of us.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.374 position:50% align:center
[BELZA]
Seems that way.

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:40.752 position:50% align:center
[BELZA] Repulsive losers.
Continuously falling through

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:42.921 position:50% align:center
the empty abysses of
their minds as they bask

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:45.215 position:50% align:center
in each other's crap like flies.

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:48.510 position:50% align:center
Just looking at these
morons makes me sick.

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:51.096 position:50% align:center
Thankfully, there's a
way to swat them all.

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:52.972 position:50% align:center
And I'll do it as soon
as I take the power

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:54.766 position:50% align:center
of the ruins from Ninomiya.

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:58.978 position:50% align:center
That is, if what my grandfather
spoke of is actually true.

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:06.152 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
He made an emergency manual?

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:08.571 position:50% align:center
Ninomiya really likes to be
prepared for everything,

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:09.698 position:50% align:center
doesn't he?

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:11.658 position:50% align:center
Yeah. My brain was
in full panic mode,

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:13.743 position:50% align:center
so it completely
slipped my mind.

00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:17.205 position:50% align:center
Luckily for us, the Ant Queen's
mind wasn't as slippery.

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:19.457 position:50% align:center
I'd classify this
as an emergency.

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:24.462 position:50% align:center
Mm. Sit tight, Ninomiya.
We will not lose.

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:28.341 position:50% align:center
We'll fight until
justice prevails!

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:30.385 position:50% align:center
[ASSESSOR A] Let's get this
special meeting for Raiza'ha

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:34.889 position:50% align:center
Mining Corp shareholders
underway. First things first.

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:37.058 position:50% align:center
The selection process
for the dungeon master

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:38.560 position:50% align:center
of the Guriano
branch obviously...

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:41.312 position:50% align:center
[BELZA] I will trample every
insect infesting this world

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:44.899 position:50% align:center
right under my stilettos and
recreate it to my liking.

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:46.818 position:50% align:center
Though, before my shoes
do any squashing,

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:49.821 position:50% align:center
I'll need a firm foothold
in corporate HQ.

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:52.115 position:50% align:center
Since no one has
raised an objection,

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:54.200 position:50% align:center
the motion is approved.

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:56.369 position:50% align:center
[BELZA] I'm standing too
tall to be dragged down

00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:59.080 position:50% align:center
by these expendable pests.

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:01.499 position:50% align:center
[ASSESSOR A] Next, the matter
of promoting Miss Belza,

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:03.209 position:50% align:center
the current Detmolt
Dungeon Master,

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:05.420 position:50% align:center
to a spot on the
board of directors.

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:08.381 position:50% align:center
Does anyone wish
to contest this?

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:09.758 position:50% align:center
[BELZA laughs]

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:16.431 position:50% align:center
Since there are no objections,
this motion is approved as well.

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:20.769 position:50% align:center
I'm so honored and grateful!
Thank you all.

00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:23.521 position:50% align:center
I won't waste this opportunity!

00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:27.108 position:50% align:center
And we're back on track. I'll
admit, I was a little concerned

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:28.985 position:50% align:center
when the media started
referring to that man's

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:32.530 position:50% align:center
outrageous ideas
as "revolutionary."

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:35.575 position:50% align:center
But I've come too far to
fumble at the finish line.

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:37.494 position:50% align:center
Victory is mine.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:39.037 position:50% align:center
[ASSESSOR A]
Our next order of business.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.538 position:50% align:center
[BELZA]
Excuse me?

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:44.209 position:50% align:center
The motion to instate a new CEO
of Raiza'ha has been made.

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:48.463 position:50% align:center
And the candidate in question
is a Mister Kinji Ninomiya.

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:53.426 position:50% align:center
Huh... Did you just
say Kinji Ninomiya?

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.886 position:50% align:center
I realize you're joking,

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:57.305 position:50% align:center
but this is neither
the time nor place.

00:09:58.473 --> 00:10:02.811 position:50% align:center
[BELZA] He is joking, right?
Who put him up to this?

00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:04.062 position:50% align:center
I demand to know

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:06.147 position:50% align:center
who brought this motion
to the table at once!

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:07.565 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
We did.

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:13.613 position:50% align:center
[BELZA gasping] All of you?
Why are you here?

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:16.783 position:50% align:center
Well, you wanted to
know who suggested

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:19.452 position:50% align:center
replacing the present CEO
with Mister Ninomiya,

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:21.079 position:50% align:center
and now you're
looking straight at them.

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:24.416 position:50% align:center
That makes no sense! What
authority do they even have?

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:25.750 position:50% align:center
It was tough.

00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:27.585 position:50% align:center
The Dungeon Black
Company's finances

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:31.423 position:50% align:center
are nothing to sneer at,
but this was still a hurdle.

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:34.551 position:50% align:center
First, we purchased 40%
of Raiza'ha's stock,

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:37.220 position:50% align:center
and then we got letters
of attorney from 15%

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:39.264 position:50% align:center
of other current shareholders.

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:42.183 position:50% align:center
Yup, yup! Cindy and I
worked really hard

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:45.729 position:50% align:center
to get them on our side! Right?

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:49.441 position:50% align:center
Some of the most
delectable negotiations ever!

00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:51.359 position:50% align:center
I don't know if
I'd say delectable.

00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:54.029 position:50% align:center
"Scary" feels like a more
appropriate term to me.

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:56.698 position:50% align:center
But in the end, we did get
their approval legally.

00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:59.034 position:50% align:center
Thanks for all your
help, big guys!

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:01.327 position:50% align:center
[BIGWIG A laughs]

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:03.705 position:50% align:center
Then, of course, we needed
to secretly collect

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:06.332 position:50% align:center
enough votes to win a majority,
all the while making sure you

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:11.546 position:50% align:center
didn't notice our moves.
Thanks for remaining oblivious.

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:13.715 position:50% align:center
[BELZA] Ninomiya is still
under arrest for looting

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:17.093 position:50% align:center
and embezzlement,
is he not? A lawbreaker

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:20.388 position:50% align:center
like him isn't eligible to
become CEO of Raiza'ha!

00:11:20.472 --> 00:11:23.099 position:50% align:center
And that's where
you're wrong, Bel.

00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:27.771 position:50% align:center
[BELZA]
Speak of the devil.

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:31.983 position:50% align:center
[SARI] How're you doing
this fine day, Miss Belza?

00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:34.444 position:50% align:center
[BELZA]
Sari! You, too?

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.529 position:50% align:center
You know, I love to
uncover the truth,

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:39.574 position:50% align:center
and thanks to Miss Shia, I have.

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:41.242 position:50% align:center
Here! This is
an official contract

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:43.536 position:50% align:center
between Raiza'ha
and Mister Ninomiya.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.954 position:50% align:center
[BELZA gasping]

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:46.915 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Looting, embezzlement,
and other suspicions.

00:11:46.998 --> 00:11:49.334 position:50% align:center
All proven false thanks
to testimonies from

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:52.879 position:50% align:center
several Raiza'ha officers,
right here, ready for review.

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:55.423 position:50% align:center
[SARI] The demonite was never
stolen to begin with.

00:11:55.507 --> 00:11:58.426 position:50% align:center
These documents prove it was
sold to Ninomiya beforehand.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.928 position:50% align:center
We also received
numerous appeals

00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:02.055 position:50% align:center
from other sources claiming
we made a mistake.

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:04.099 position:50% align:center
When you're staring that much
hard evidence in the face,

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:06.393 position:50% align:center
you have to concede.

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:07.602 position:50% align:center
Well done, Ninomiya.

00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:10.980 position:50% align:center
Worked like a charm!
Good thinking, as usual!

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:14.234 position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:12:14.317 --> 00:12:15.402 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Nothing much.

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:18.405 position:50% align:center
Just the Black Company's
emergency manual.

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:21.408 position:50% align:center
Really comes in handy
on a rainy day.

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:24.077 position:50% align:center
Impressive. He had every
detail planned to a tee,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.954 position:50% align:center
right down to his
wrongful arrest.

00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:26.955 position:50% align:center
[KINJI chuckles]

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:30.500 position:50% align:center
[BELZA gasping]

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.961 position:50% align:center
So, bottom line,
I'll be calling the shots

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:35.630 position:50% align:center
for the Raiza'ha Mining
Corporation from now on.

00:12:35.714 --> 00:12:38.299 position:50% align:center
Thanks for all your support.

00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:42.554 position:50% align:center
Stop getting in my way!

00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:45.265 position:50% align:center
It's like a pastime for you,
but it's torture for me!

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:46.725 position:50% align:center
Come on, people!

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:49.060 position:50% align:center
He's using monsters to threaten
the world as we know it!

00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:50.729 position:50% align:center
We can't stand by and
let him get away with this!

00:12:50.812 --> 00:12:52.105 position:50% align:center
[SECRETARY A] You need
to calm down, Lady Belza!

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:54.107 position:50% align:center
Unhand me this instant
you miserable bug!

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.152 position:50% align:center
Heh. Call me a threat to
humanity all you want.

00:12:57.235 --> 00:13:01.364 position:50% align:center
But at the end of the day,
the only thing I truly am is me!

00:13:07.162 --> 00:13:10.081 position:50% align:center
Uh, so back to the matter at
hand. This motion was put

00:13:10.165 --> 00:13:12.250 position:50% align:center
to a vote. And though
it was done in secret,

00:13:12.334 --> 00:13:14.586 position:50% align:center
it did result in a
decisive outcome.

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:17.047 position:50% align:center
From this day forward,
Mister Kinji Ninomiya

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.258 position:50% align:center
will serve as Raiza'ha's
chief executive officer!

00:13:20.342 --> 00:13:23.136 position:50% align:center
Now that is what I call a win.

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:25.889 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
A win, indeed. And soon after,

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:29.225 position:50% align:center
the Dungeon Black Company made
the Raiza'ha Mining Corporation

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:33.772 position:50% align:center
a wholly owned subsidiary
and accelerated its growth.

00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:39.110 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
What a splendid view.

00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:41.654 position:50% align:center
Looking down on the public
is a right reserved only for

00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:46.034 position:50% align:center
the victor. There!
Enjoy this rain of prosperity!

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:48.286 position:50% align:center
There isn't a jerk on this
planet who would dare oppose

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.206 position:50% align:center
me now! I've ascended
from NEET to god!

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:53.500 position:50% align:center
The god of winning
and being awesome!

00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:56.836 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.257 position:50% align:center
[gasping] Ew, it's on me!

00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:05.512 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
I got exactly what I wanted.

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:09.974 position:50% align:center
And yet I still feel so...
I can't even describe it.

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:14.270 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Seriously, Belza?
This design is pure crap.

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:15.980 position:50% align:center
Do you honestly believe
something so boring

00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:18.692 position:50% align:center
will attract guests to
our establishments?

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:21.986 position:50% align:center
I apologize for wasting your
time, President Ninomiya.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.447 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Ranga! Your designs
are just as bad!

00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:26.950 position:50% align:center
Why? I think they're okay.

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:29.202 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] We'll have another
competition in a week.

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:31.162 position:50% align:center
Get some new ideas by then!

00:14:31.246 --> 00:14:33.373 position:50% align:center
--Yes, sir.
--Okie-doke.

00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:41.506 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Up for an
inspection, Wanibe?

00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:43.925 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] You typically make
all the important

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:45.468 position:50% align:center
decisions yourself.

00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:48.263 position:50% align:center
So, it's kind of a shock to
see you give others the reins.

00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:50.849 position:50% align:center
If this company solely relied
on me in order to operate,

00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:53.852 position:50% align:center
then it would never grow.
Besides, I think having those

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:57.230 position:50% align:center
two compete is healthy
for their relationship.

00:14:57.313 --> 00:15:00.483 position:50% align:center
That goes for you, too. I know
we've been partners for a while,

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:03.653 position:50% align:center
but I hope you realize you won't
be able to rely on me forever.

00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:06.573 position:50% align:center
Don't forget how to stand
on your own two feet.

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:07.907 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:15.373 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] You think Mister
Ninomiya is acting weird?

00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:18.043 position:50% align:center
It'd be weirder if he
wasn't acting weird.

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.794 position:50% align:center
Perhaps weird
isn't the right word,

00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:22.422 position:50% align:center
but his behavior lately
has definitely been off.

00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:24.674 position:50% align:center
And something he divulged
to me a while back

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:27.260 position:50% align:center
keeps running through my mind.

00:15:27.344 --> 00:15:30.221 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Though it took a minute,
this time it finally hit home.

00:15:30.305 --> 00:15:32.724 position:50% align:center
I really am a
total outsider here.

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:34.059 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
Outsider?

00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:36.227 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Yeah. I blend in well enough,

00:15:36.311 --> 00:15:38.897 position:50% align:center
but I'm not from this world.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:39.981 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE sighs]

00:15:40.065 --> 00:15:43.360 position:50% align:center
Uh, just how intoxicated was he?

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:46.112 position:50% align:center
I don't think that was
the alcohol. If I can

00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:49.282 position:50% align:center
remember right, Ninomiya's
from a place called "Japan."

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:52.160 position:50% align:center
In the future, he debated
whether he should return there

00:15:52.243 --> 00:15:53.995 position:50% align:center
or travel back in
our world's time.

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:55.497 position:50% align:center
I just knew it.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.248 position:50% align:center
But what does him being
from this "Japan"

00:15:57.332 --> 00:16:01.711 position:50% align:center
have to do with his behavior?
Wait, you don't think...

00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:04.589 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] Yes, I do. Ninomiya
is most likely going to use

00:16:04.673 --> 00:16:06.633 position:50% align:center
the ruins to return
to his world.

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:10.178 position:50% align:center
No! How could he just leave?

00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:14.015 position:50% align:center
This a meeting?
Why didn't I know about it?

00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:16.976 position:50% align:center
Or are you just slacking off?

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.021 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE grunts]
I have a question!

00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:22.524 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Yeah, what's up?

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:24.067 position:50% align:center
Now be honest with me.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.361 position:50% align:center
You're thinking of
leaving us, aren't you?

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:31.825 position:50% align:center
I am, but what gave it away?

00:16:31.908 --> 00:16:33.827 position:50% align:center
Be rational, Mister Ninomiya!

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.578 position:50% align:center
You're really going to leave?

00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:36.830 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:38.832 position:50% align:center
Please explain.

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:42.002 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] All this time I've been
working so I don't have to work.

00:16:42.085 --> 00:16:44.337 position:50% align:center
And now that I'm there,
I finally realized

00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:48.299 position:50% align:center
that chasing after a goal
is what really fulfills me.

00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:51.428 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm being
more honest with myself

00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:53.596 position:50% align:center
and these so-called "feelings."

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.432 position:50% align:center
Actually, if it weren't
for the fun times

00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:57.809 position:50% align:center
we shared, I wouldn't have
been able to see that.

00:16:57.892 --> 00:16:59.477 position:50% align:center
So, thank you.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.942 position:50% align:center
But! I'll make sure things're
spick and span before I go.

00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:10.363 position:50% align:center
I expect you guys to get
back to work, too. Later.

00:17:10.447 --> 00:17:12.574 position:50% align:center
[door closes]

00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:15.076 position:50% align:center
Wanibe's hunch was right.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.663 position:50% align:center
He comes and turns our world
upside down only to leave it?

00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:22.292 position:50% align:center
Put yourself in his shoes.
He worked hard to reform Amuria

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:25.086 position:50% align:center
all while hiding his
desire to go home.

00:17:27.005 --> 00:17:29.215 position:50% align:center
We have to give him
a proper farewell.

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:32.260 position:50% align:center
It may be sad. Extremely sad.

00:17:32.344 --> 00:17:35.597 position:50% align:center
But it's the best way
to end a chapter.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.183 position:50% align:center
We owe it to him and ourselves.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:06.419 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Wow. What do we have
here? Some kind of party?

00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:09.130 position:50% align:center
A surprise party, and judging
from your reaction, it worked.

00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:11.132 position:50% align:center
We threw it together
to send you off.

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:14.135 position:50% align:center
Aww. Look at you
being all thoughtful.

00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:16.429 position:50% align:center
Well, of course.
How could I not?

00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:18.765 position:50% align:center
After everything we've been
through together, I mean.

00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:21.601 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Uh. Yeah. I guess that's true.

00:18:21.685 --> 00:18:23.728 position:50% align:center
I could barely keep up
with your ridiculous antics

00:18:23.812 --> 00:18:25.313 position:50% align:center
when we first met.

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:28.608 position:50% align:center
If I wasn't internally screaming
at you, I was plain confused.

00:18:28.692 --> 00:18:31.403 position:50% align:center
But then watching you strive to
make your outlandish schemes

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:34.114 position:50% align:center
real made me rethink
how I was living,

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:37.575 position:50% align:center
allowing others
to boss me around.

00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:39.160 position:50% align:center
It gave me strength.

00:18:39.244 --> 00:18:41.204 position:50% align:center
Strength I didn't
even know I needed.

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:44.749 position:50% align:center
Strength to find what I want
and take that first step.

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:46.668 position:50% align:center
And that's precisely why
I support you

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:48.503 position:50% align:center
in going after
what you want, too!

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:51.464 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
You mean that?

00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:53.133 position:50% align:center
It's nice to have
someone as reliable

00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:55.885 position:50% align:center
and understanding
as you in my corner.

00:18:55.969 --> 00:19:00.306 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm leaving you
in charge here. Cool?

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.851 position:50% align:center
Yes! I'll make you proud!

00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:05.520 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Right! Now that we're
past that sentimental stuff,

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:07.397 position:50% align:center
it's time to get
this party started!

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.649 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna drink
my weight in booze!

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:11.526 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE laughs]

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:14.571 position:50% align:center
I have to be honest with you!

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:15.822 position:50% align:center
The more I grow
our company,

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:17.532 position:50% align:center
the more reason we'll
have to celebrate,

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:20.660 position:50% align:center
so hopefully parties like this
become a regular thing.

00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:23.121 position:50% align:center
Yes! Hear, hear!
More growth, more parties.

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:25.123 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:28.960 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] Um. Did you mean
what you just said?

00:19:29.044 --> 00:19:30.712 position:50% align:center
Yeah, why?

00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:33.965 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] So, you intend to
make the company even bigger?

00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:36.051 position:50% align:center
You got it. I said as
much the other day,

00:19:36.134 --> 00:19:37.886 position:50% align:center
but the only thing that
makes me feel more alive

00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:39.888 position:50% align:center
than my pulse is
chasing a goal.

00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:42.182 position:50% align:center
So, yes! I've made the
executive decision

00:19:42.265 --> 00:19:45.060 position:50% align:center
to extend my reach to
this entire planet!

00:19:45.143 --> 00:19:47.604 position:50% align:center
And in order to accomplish that,
I'll travel to the dungeons

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:51.107 position:50% align:center
in other countries and
gain even more power!

00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:53.693 position:50% align:center
Now just to make sure
we're on the same page here,

00:19:53.777 --> 00:19:55.612 position:50% align:center
you don't harbor
any plans or desires

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:58.239 position:50% align:center
to return to the world
you originally came from?

00:19:58.323 --> 00:20:01.910 position:50% align:center
Yuck. After everything I've done
to be successful in Amuria?

00:20:01.993 --> 00:20:04.662 position:50% align:center
What kind of idiot would
give up the life I have now?

00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:06.706 position:50% align:center
Not me, that's for sure.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:07.916 position:50% align:center
My apologies, friends.

00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:09.793 position:50% align:center
I think I may have
jumped to conclusions.

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:11.211 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:20:11.294 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
I think so, too.

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:16.341 position:50% align:center
Well, at any rate,
relax while you can!

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:19.135 position:50% align:center
Because I'm gonna make
you work till you drop!

00:20:24.516 --> 00:20:26.184 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.270 position:50% align:center
Be ready for anything!

00:20:29.354 --> 00:20:31.564 position:50% align:center
Um. Okay.

00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:35.402 position:50% align:center
I've got 30 jumbo
pizzas and 50 boxes

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:37.570 position:50% align:center
of barbecue for the Dungeon
Black Company team,

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:38.822 position:50% align:center
so get it while
it's hot 'n' fresh!

00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:41.282 position:50% align:center
Wonderful, you can
put it over here.

00:20:41.366 --> 00:20:42.742 position:50% align:center
[DELIVERY GUY A]
Who should I give this to?

00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:44.494 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
I'll take it.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.915 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] Will you please pay
the nice delivery boy?

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.169 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
How much did you guys order?!

00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:55.755 position:50% align:center
Not enough because
I'm still hungry.

00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:59.426 position:50% align:center
I agree, Rim. I'll get
more food right away.

00:20:59.509 --> 00:21:01.720 position:50% align:center
Should probably get
more drinks, too.

00:21:01.803 --> 00:21:03.263 position:50% align:center
So, you're gonna make
the guest of honor

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:05.765 position:50% align:center
foot the bill at his
own farewell party?

00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:08.184 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] Just make
the company pay for it.

00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:09.436 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
Yes, exactly.

00:21:09.519 --> 00:21:11.813 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Since when?

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:15.358 position:50% align:center
That was just Rim's warm up.
It's time to get serious.

00:21:15.442 --> 00:21:16.776 position:50% align:center
Your belly's bigger
than your head,

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.361 position:50% align:center
but you're not serious yet?

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:21.656 position:50% align:center
I'd be a million times richer
if it weren't for your stomach!

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.325 position:50% align:center
[alarm blares]

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:26.953 position:50% align:center
[GOBLIN BOSS] All right!
Stay as polished and sharp

00:21:27.037 --> 00:21:29.164 position:50% align:center
as your pick axes
in there, gentlemen!

00:21:29.247 --> 00:21:30.290 position:50% align:center
[GRUNTS]
Sir!

00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:31.666 position:50% align:center
Good.

00:21:59.361 --> 00:22:02.405 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Hey. Long time
no see, old friend.

00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:05.658 position:50% align:center
I bet you're bored.
So why not follow me?

00:22:05.742 --> 00:22:07.077 position:50% align:center
It's bound to be fun.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.455 position:50% align:center
Cause you and me are gonna
conquer this whole world!
