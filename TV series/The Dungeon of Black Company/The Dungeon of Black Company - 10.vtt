Uh?

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:22.522 position:50% align:center
[DEMON LORD]
It hurts. It really hurts...

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.663 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] I wonder what's taking
Ninomiya so long?

00:00:40.248 --> 00:00:41.750 position:50% align:center
Jeez...

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:44.794 position:50% align:center
[KINJI yelling]

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.379 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Hm? That's not good!

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:51.426 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Not good at all!

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:54.596 position:50% align:center
Just when you think it can't get
worse, a new one pops out!

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.016 position:50% align:center
Feel free to act on
any plan you might have!

00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:01.436 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Come on! Let's
coordinate our attacks!

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:06.483 position:50% align:center

[DINO B groans]

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:24.542 position:50% align:center
You really saved
our hides just now!

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:27.587 position:50% align:center
We're lucky fighters as strong
as you guys were here!

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:29.589 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Hmph. Yeah, you are.

00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:31.132 position:50% align:center
How can you act so condescending

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:33.343 position:50% align:center
when all you did
was shoot some glue?

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:36.638 position:50% align:center
Wait. I'm a little lost, so can
we please back up a second?

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:39.474 position:50% align:center
Like, who're these new
companions of yours?

00:01:39.557 --> 00:01:41.518 position:50% align:center
Some guys who came up
from the fifth level.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:42.977 position:50% align:center
They also happen to be the scout

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:45.480 position:50% align:center
and maintenance teams
for Belza's Bodyguards.

00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:47.732 position:50% align:center
And if what this motley
crew said is true,

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:50.819 position:50% align:center
everybody here is trapped on
this floor with no way out.

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:53.613 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Huh? What?!

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:29.042 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] So, the path to
the third floor is blocked!

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:32.379 position:50% align:center
No. We really are trapped
inside with no way out.

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:35.590 position:50% align:center
The passage to the fifth floor
is in the exact same condition.

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:38.718 position:50% align:center
So, we can't venture up or down
no matter where we intend to go.

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:40.845 position:50% align:center
Any bright ideas,
fearless leader?

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.682 position:50% align:center
Our top priority is to
proceed deeper, but...

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.266 position:50% align:center
...kinda hard to
come up with a plan

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.103 position:50% align:center
when we don't have a clue why
we were trapped to begin with.

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:49.354 position:50% align:center
What gives, gramps?

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:51.356 position:50% align:center
Why'd you move up
an entire floor?

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.817 position:50% align:center
[BOSS A sighs]
It happened so fast,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.403 position:50% align:center
but I'll try to explain
it as best I can.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.363 position:50% align:center
A few days ago,
the Bodyguards were slaying

00:03:58.446 --> 00:04:00.865 position:50% align:center
colossal monsters on the
fifth level like usual,

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.244 position:50% align:center
while my team and I
stood by at a safe distance.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.621 position:50% align:center
But suddenly, the whole
floor was rumbling

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:09.040 position:50% align:center
and the entrance
began to collapse!

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:12.711 position:50% align:center
We rushed to escape
while we had the chance.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:15.588 position:50% align:center
We got lucky because of how
close we were to the exit.

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:17.716 position:50% align:center
But the same can't be said
for the Bodyguards,

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.342 position:50% align:center
and now they're
stuck down there.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.052 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you just left!

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:23.346 position:50% align:center
Do you know if they
survived the cave-in?

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.556 position:50% align:center
Probably.

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.600 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Wh-- "Probably"?

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.521 position:50% align:center
We've never been
to the fifth floor,

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:34.107 position:50% align:center
so could you tell us what
it's like down there?

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.485 position:50% align:center
Well, uh, it's a very strange
floor, for starters.

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.031 position:50% align:center
The monsters are far from weak.
But there are just two big ones

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:42.824 position:50% align:center
standing guard in
front of the gate.

00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:46.202 position:50% align:center
Get out. The whole floor only
has two monsters total?

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.872 position:50% align:center
Yes, although the strength
they both possess is absurd.

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.582 position:50% align:center
We've been brainstorming
how to deal with them,

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:52.667 position:50% align:center
but haven't made
any real progress.

00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:55.337 position:50% align:center
That's awful. The Bodyguards
are going to need support

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.131 position:50% align:center
if these things are as tough
as you say they are...

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:00.592 position:50% align:center
Well, we shouldn't lose
faith in them just yet.

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:03.303 position:50% align:center
My team doesn't really add
to their combat ability.

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:05.096 position:50% align:center
Those guys are strong
enough to survive,

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.265 position:50% align:center
they just don't have
a means of retreat.

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.851 position:50% align:center
I doubt what caused these
cave-ins is natural, yet

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:12.854 position:50% align:center
there's too little information
to investigate it properly.

00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:15.065 position:50% align:center
[sighs] And them's the breaks.

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.192 position:50% align:center
At least till we
establish a base.

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:20.028 position:50% align:center
Won't be able to think straight
if we're tired, will we?

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:22.447 position:50% align:center
We've got you covered if
a base is what you need.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.491 position:50% align:center
We already built one!

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:34.209 position:50% align:center
[KINJI grunts]
It's like dino central!

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:37.921 position:50% align:center
Well, what now?

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:42.008 position:50% align:center
Well, what else, Shia? I'm
taking all these suckers out.

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:49.849 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] Um. Are they
fighting each other?

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:51.643 position:50% align:center
[WORKERS gasping]

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:56.815 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN] Oh, how I have
longed for this day!

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:59.693 position:50% align:center
Eh?

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:02.654 position:50% align:center
Every second that passed since
you went missing was torture!

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:06.074 position:50% align:center
Do you hear me?
Straight torture!

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50% align:center
Who're they supposed to be?

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.953 position:50% align:center
Your secret mistress
and love child?

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:12.080 position:50% align:center
[gasps] A secret child?

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.290 position:50% align:center
You've got some explaining
to do, Mister Ninomiya!

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.626 position:50% align:center
Maybe don't strangle the guy
you want answers from!

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.962 position:50% align:center
But I've never seen this
lady before in my life!

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.339 position:50% align:center
Your words cut even
deeper than a blade!

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:24.050 position:50% align:center
I patiently waited for you,
and this is how you treat me?

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:27.095 position:50% align:center
You are scum! Now legally
claim your offspring!

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:30.682 position:50% align:center
Calm down! That is not
my kid! Listen, lady!

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:33.518 position:50% align:center
Next thing you say
should be your name!

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:35.228 position:50% align:center
I hoped your heart
would recognize mine,

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:37.397 position:50% align:center
even in this form.

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:47.699 position:50% align:center
This should jog your memory.
Right, Master Ninomiya?

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:50.368 position:50% align:center
Whoa, you're the
Dungeon Ant Queen?

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:55.331 position:50% align:center
I don't recall you having this
nifty transformation magic

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:56.791 position:50% align:center
when we last met.

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:58.835 position:50% align:center
[ANT QUEEN] It's like a defense
mechanism that developed

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:01.546 position:50% align:center
since we've been hunted
so much recently.

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:04.215 position:50% align:center
This form is convenient
in more ways than one.

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:06.134 position:50% align:center
I can waltz right
into enemy territory

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:08.178 position:50% align:center
without anybody blinking an eye.

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:11.890 position:50% align:center
Also, these arms are better
for holding this little one.

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:14.559 position:50% align:center
That "little one's" actually
a Majin, though, isn't she?

00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:17.395 position:50% align:center
What're you doing toting
that kid around, anyway?

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:19.731 position:50% align:center
[ANT QUEEN] I came across her
in the dungeon.

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:23.735 position:50% align:center
Guess you can relax, Shia!
It's not an affair after all!

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:26.946 position:50% align:center
Hey! That was never the issue
I was concerned about,

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.115 position:50% align:center
so please refrain from
phrasing it that way!

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.700 position:50% align:center
There was quite
a bit of confusion

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:32.410 position:50% align:center
in your absence,
Master Ninomiya,

00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:33.953 position:50% align:center
especially since it
was followed by

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:37.248 position:50% align:center
a horrific tremor and
changes to the dungeon.

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:39.876 position:50% align:center
I decided it would be best
to lead my subordinates

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.212 position:50% align:center
away from the source
of the changes.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:46.132 position:50% align:center
That's when I happened upon
this slumbering angel.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:48.510 position:50% align:center
We knew she was a substitute
ruler of the dungeon

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:50.095 position:50% align:center
meant to replace Miss Rim,

00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:54.557 position:50% align:center
thus many us were
rightfully terrified of her.

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:58.019 position:50% align:center
Even so, I had to
protect this cutie pie

00:07:58.103 --> 00:08:00.230 position:50% align:center
with all my might!

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:02.190 position:50% align:center
Pretty drastic change in tone.

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:05.110 position:50% align:center
She's connected to the
irregularities we've seen.

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:07.821 position:50% align:center
That's one thing I'm
absolutely certain of.

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:09.739 position:50% align:center
Whenever this child falls ill,

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:12.283 position:50% align:center
the dungeon is beset
with problems.

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:15.578 position:50% align:center
The Majin and the dungeon
are in sync with one another.

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:17.831 position:50% align:center
Usually, these creatures
are just tasked with

00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:21.876 position:50% align:center
controlling the circulation of
magic within their domains.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.379 position:50% align:center
So, when Miss Rim
abandoned the dungeon,

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:28.299 position:50% align:center
she also abandoned her duty.

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:32.429 position:50% align:center
An irregularity
was born as a result.

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.806 position:50% align:center
The dungeon was
attempting to right itself,

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:36.975 position:50% align:center
but because of how weak
the new Majin is,

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:38.768 position:50% align:center
it's only gotten more hectic.

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.562 position:50% align:center
[coughing]

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.566 position:50% align:center
Now, the flow of power
within the planet

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:47.527 position:50% align:center
has been disturbed.
The ecosystem is ruined, which,

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:51.156 position:50% align:center
of course, further weakens
the Majin in a negative spiral.

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:52.949 position:50% align:center
The good news is that
because we know

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.743 position:50% align:center
what caused all
of this insanity,

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:56.953 position:50% align:center
we also know the key
to fixing it lies

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:59.039 position:50% align:center
in nursing the little
one back to health.

00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:00.832 position:50% align:center
That's why you have
to save this child!

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.834 position:50% align:center
I beg of you, Master Ninomiya!

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:05.211 position:50% align:center
I am willing to sacrifice
anything to help,

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:08.131 position:50% align:center
that's how serious this is!

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:14.888 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Miles underground and
there's still night and day.

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:18.683 position:50% align:center
If this place wasn't weird
before, it sure is now.

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:25.398 position:50% align:center
[coughing, panting]

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:26.983 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:29.903 position:50% align:center
This has gotta be the biggest
pain in the butt of all time.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:33.073 position:50% align:center
--[heavy footsteps]
--Hm?

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:37.202 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] What the--?
Is that Rim down there?

Have some Mandragora meat!

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:57.180 position:50% align:center
It's super hard to come by,
but also super tasty!

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:58.515 position:50% align:center
You should try it!

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.350 position:50% align:center

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:03.353 position:50% align:center

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:17.158 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:18.952 position:50% align:center
Please behave yourself.

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:39.097 position:50% align:center

[screaming]

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:51.276 position:50% align:center
That hurts. Okay, so...
Maybe we're not friends.

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:54.612 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,
you defeated her

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:56.740 position:50% align:center
when the two of you
faced off in the past.

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:59.826 position:50% align:center
Perhaps she's afraid of you
in an instinctive way.

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:03.288 position:50% align:center
[grunting, screaming]

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.216 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Why are you alone out here

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.552 position:50% align:center
looking like you
missed dinnertime?

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:23.808 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] You know.
You threw me for a loop.

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:26.561 position:50% align:center
Never saw you
as the babysitting type.

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:29.272 position:50% align:center
I wanted to know what
life was like outside.

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:30.857 position:50% align:center
So I left the dungeon
without thinking

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.401 position:50% align:center
about how much trouble
I would cause when I did.

00:11:33.485 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
Or what would happen
to the next me

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:37.906 position:50% align:center
if I wasn't around
to help her grow.

00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:41.743 position:50% align:center
I was only thinking of myself
and now she's suffering.

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:50.543 position:50% align:center
[RIM] Um, Kinji? Could you
please help me help her?

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:52.128 position:50% align:center
All right. You win.

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:53.546 position:50% align:center
Plus, we're bonafide comrades

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.340 position:50% align:center
with how many meals
we've shared.

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:56.883 position:50% align:center
I'll figure something out.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:58.843 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:00.804 position:50% align:center
But speaking of meals,
you'll have to cut down

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:03.098 position:50% align:center
on how much food you eat
in exchange for my help.

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:06.309 position:50% align:center
[RIM] Hmph.
Yeah, that's not happening.

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:13.358 position:50% align:center
Everyone's present now.

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:16.486 position:50% align:center
So, what's the big announcement
we woke up at this hour to hear?

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center
I came up with a new
plan and figured

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:19.948 position:50% align:center
the sooner I tell you,
the better!

00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:22.325 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
Of course, you did.

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:24.285 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] As you know,
we are unable to progress

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:26.830 position:50% align:center
or retreat from the floor
we're currently on.

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:29.416 position:50% align:center
We've deduced the cause of
this problem is from the flow

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:32.377 position:50% align:center
of magic, or rather, the
disturbance of that flow.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.920 position:50% align:center
Knowing doesn't do us any good.

00:12:34.004 --> 00:12:35.964 position:50% align:center
We don't have the power
or the skillsets

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:38.133 position:50% align:center
to solve a problem
of that magnitude.

[WANIBE grunting]

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:40.760 position:50% align:center
And that's where you're wrong.

00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:43.013 position:50% align:center
The dungeon just has a
little case of indigestion,

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:44.264 position:50% align:center
and if you ask me,

00:12:44.347 --> 00:12:46.224 position:50% align:center
that's completely within
our power to correct!

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:51.312 position:50% align:center
Especially since we have such a
great leader calling the shots.

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:52.731 position:50% align:center
I intend to tinker
with this place

00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:54.482 position:50% align:center
until it's the best
it's ever been!

the aquatic monsters

00:13:38.777 --> 00:13:41.196 position:50% align:center
should regain their normal
strength in no time.

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:42.238 position:50% align:center

The first step to fixing
this total mess

of a dungeon is putting its

Maybe I need enough

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.877 position:50% align:center
But I'm pretty sure we don't
have any more ice in this place.

If Kinji's right about those

it's a tree-type monster seed.

What was the point of
guiding them here, though?

00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:59.250 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] So they can chow down
as much as they want.

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:01.419 position:50% align:center
The forest was growing
at a nonsensical rate,

00:16:01.503 --> 00:16:03.838 position:50% align:center
but these guys will
keep it reined in.

00:16:11.054 --> 00:16:16.393 position:50% align:center
Why is it so cold? I guess
so the ice doesn't melt.

00:16:46.381 --> 00:16:48.800 position:50% align:center
Hop-rabbits were too
concentrated in one specific

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:52.137 position:50% align:center

That's all well and good,

00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:54.806 position:50% align:center

said why I have to wear

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:55.724 position:50% align:center

It's mating season!

00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:01.062 position:50% align:center
if one of them's
attracted to you!

00:17:01.146 --> 00:17:03.648 position:50% align:center

[KINJI] Feel that? The dungeon
rebuild is nearing its climax!

00:18:05.377 --> 00:18:06.878 position:50% align:center
These creatures
were once gentle,

00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:09.130 position:50% align:center
but due to the stress of
having a stronger monster

00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:12.592 position:50% align:center
settle in their pond,
they began excreting toxins.

00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:15.053 position:50% align:center
Slaying the bigger monster
might be our best option,

00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:17.889 position:50% align:center
but diving in there and
finding it could be tough.

00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:21.393 position:50% align:center
Fine! I say we drain
the whole darn pond!

00:18:26.481 --> 00:18:28.817 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Whoa-ho-ho! I knew
slimes could grow,

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.819 position:50% align:center
but I didn't think
they got this big!

00:18:30.902 --> 00:18:32.404 position:50% align:center
I was just trying
to test their limits,

00:18:32.487 --> 00:18:34.656 position:50% align:center
but they sucked that pond dry!

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:38.410 position:50% align:center
Which reminds me, we should've
found a big monster by now.

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:51.464 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] It must have absorbed
mana from the ground

00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:53.675 position:50% align:center
to reach this gargantuan size!

[ANT QUEEN]
How positively dreadful!

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:59.347 position:50% align:center
But if we can kill it, that
should be enough to normalize

00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:02.308 position:50% align:center
the mana circulation for
the entire fourth level!

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:04.269 position:50% align:center
In other words,
this is the final step.

00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:06.646 position:50% align:center
Cool. It's nice when
things are simple.

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:07.749 position:50% align:center
I see. Much healthier.
You did a great job.

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:09.376 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:12.837 position:50% align:center
Sorry, short stuff, didn't know
I couldn't pay her a compliment.

00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:14.089 position:50% align:center
"Short stuff"?

00:20:14.172 --> 00:20:16.800 position:50% align:center
Surely you can think of
a better name than that.

00:20:16.883 --> 00:20:18.760 position:50% align:center
I almost forgot humankind's
quaint custom

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:20.553 position:50% align:center
of naming individuals.

00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:22.514 position:50% align:center
Any suggestions for the Majin?

00:20:22.597 --> 00:20:24.516 position:50% align:center
Rim. This one's all you.

00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:26.518 position:50% align:center
It's up to me?

00:20:26.601 --> 00:20:28.436 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] She'll like whatever
you pick ten times more

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.480 position:50% align:center
than anything I think of.

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:33.024 position:50% align:center
Let's see...

00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:39.030 position:50% align:center
Uh! I've got it! Sky!

00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:41.241 position:50% align:center
Sky, huh?

00:20:41.324 --> 00:20:44.411 position:50% align:center
Okay. But what made you
choose that for her?

00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:46.121 position:50% align:center
Reason one is because it
was the first thing

00:20:46.204 --> 00:20:49.082 position:50% align:center
outside the dungeon that
managed to impress me.

00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:50.875 position:50% align:center
And reason two...

00:20:54.462 --> 00:20:56.131 position:50% align:center
[RIM] ...I really liked how
the sky looked

00:20:56.214 --> 00:20:58.925 position:50% align:center
when I was out
walking with Ranga.

00:21:01.052 --> 00:21:03.179 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:05.515 position:50% align:center
How the sky looked when
you were with Ranga?

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:06.933 position:50% align:center
What's that mean?

00:21:07.017 --> 00:21:10.854 position:50% align:center
It's for us to know 'n'
you to never find out!

00:21:10.937 --> 00:21:11.896 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
Mm.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.107 position:50% align:center
So, my name is Sky from now on?

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.568 position:50% align:center
Whoa! She can talk!

00:21:16.651 --> 00:21:20.196 position:50% align:center
The two of us are gonna eat all
of the tasty things together!

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.781 position:50% align:center
All the tasty things?

00:21:21.865 --> 00:21:23.992 position:50% align:center
Yep! The world's filled
with a whole bunch

00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:26.369 position:50% align:center
of yummy stuff to eat!

00:21:26.453 --> 00:21:28.580 position:50% align:center
Kay! Let's go!

00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:34.544 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?
Where are you hurt?

00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:36.171 position:50% align:center
I thought that she was cured!

00:21:36.254 --> 00:21:37.464 position:50% align:center
Not all the way.

00:21:37.547 --> 00:21:39.549 position:50% align:center
And for her to have such
a violent reaction

00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:41.217 position:50% align:center
must mean there's
something terribly wrong

00:21:41.301 --> 00:21:43.136 position:50% align:center
in another part of the dungeon.

00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:45.305 position:50% align:center
[RIM gasping]

00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:57.067 position:50% align:center
[FIGHTER A]
Sonya. Sonya!

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.652 position:50% align:center
Come on! I need you
to open your eyes!

00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:01.696 position:50% align:center
You promised me we'd clear
the dungeon together,

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.741 position:50% align:center
but we can't do that
if you don't wake up!

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.620 position:50% align:center
Why? What happened?

00:22:08.703 --> 00:22:10.455 position:50% align:center
I thought that there were
only supposed to be

00:22:10.538 --> 00:22:13.833 position:50% align:center
two boss monsters standing
guard at this level!

00:22:13.917 --> 00:22:17.128 position:50% align:center
So where are all of these
other ones coming from?

00:22:17.212 --> 00:22:19.214 position:50% align:center
