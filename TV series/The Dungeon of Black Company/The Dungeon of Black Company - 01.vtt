Beautiful day.

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:39.122 position:50% align:center
Look at them with
their flimsy umbrellas,

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:43.209 position:50% align:center
trudging through this downpour
to get to the office on time.

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:46.629 position:50% align:center
Stuffed liked sardines
in rush-hour trains.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:50.842 position:50% align:center
Oh, how much it
must suck to be them!

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:58.099 position:50% align:center
[KINJI laughing]

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:01.853 position:50% align:center
Yes! At long last! I have
become the perfect Pro NEET!

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:04.356 position:50% align:center
The crème de la crème!
The true GOAT!

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.399 position:50% align:center
I worked my ponytail off
so this plan

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:08.943 position:50% align:center
would come to fruition,
and it finally has!

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.153 position:50% align:center
I used my allowance money

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:11.905 position:50% align:center
for swing trading
to build capital,

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:14.866 position:50% align:center
which I then invested in
overseas real estate.

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:16.951 position:50% align:center
Didn't even need a
nine-to-five job

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:19.537 position:50% align:center
with the passive income
pouring in from abroad!

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:21.623 position:50% align:center
After establishing a
way to earn a living

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:23.124 position:50% align:center
without lifting a finger,

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:25.585 position:50% align:center
I built three apartments in
Tokyo and made the penthouse

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:29.172 position:50% align:center
in one of them my
personal castle!

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:32.550 position:50% align:center
I now have a flawless lifestyle
less fortunate losers

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:34.719 position:50% align:center
will never experience!

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:36.638 position:50% align:center
This could be my
final resting place

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:39.391 position:50% align:center
and I wouldn't even care!

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:41.768 position:50% align:center
The alpha and the omega.

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:46.022 position:50% align:center
I can be a lazy bum every day
for the rest of my life!

[KINJI]
Uh...

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:20.932 position:50% align:center
But my flawless lifestyle!

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:29.065 position:50% align:center
[BELZA] My esteemed colleagues.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.942 position:50% align:center
Before our morning
meeting gets underway,

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:33.987 position:50% align:center
I'd like to pose
an important question.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.699 position:50% align:center
Are you all working as if
your lives depend on it?

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:39.784 position:50% align:center
Are you doing everything
within your power

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:41.536 position:50% align:center
to dominate our competitors?

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:43.413 position:50% align:center
If the answer to that
is a resounding "no,"

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.540 position:50% align:center
I have a suggestion
I urge you to try.

00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:49.044 position:50% align:center
Just once, please, put your work
before sleep and mealtimes!

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:51.046 position:50% align:center
Sacrifice your rest
and food and see

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.465 position:50% align:center
if that gets the
results we need!

00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:56.718 position:50% align:center
Our clients' gratitude will make
your hardships worthwhile,

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:58.053 position:50% align:center
transforming your labor into

00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.637 position:50% align:center
a timeless treasure
called "fulfillment"...

00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:03.975 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] What a giant load
of self-serving bull crap.

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.102 position:50% align:center
[BELZA] Mine the uncut
gems of satisfaction

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.521 position:50% align:center

[NARRATOR] Kinji Ninomiya,
age 24, ex-Pro NEET.

00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:21.993 position:50% align:center
He currently lives in a world
of demihumans called Amuria.

00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:24.662 position:50% align:center
In ancient times, the dungeons
of this enchanted land

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:27.624 position:50% align:center
were brimming with
monsters and treasure.

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:31.378 position:50% align:center
Powerful beings seeking fame and
glory once braved their depths,

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.129 position:50% align:center
however, as the years passed,

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.924 position:50% align:center
things modernized,
and this custom changed.

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:38.468 position:50% align:center
Dungeons went from being
explored to exploited

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.679 position:50% align:center
for the energy-rich
demonite within them.

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:42.347 position:50% align:center
Governments regulated
the commodity

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.225 position:50% align:center
by licensing companies
to oversee its production.

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:47.936 position:50% align:center
The Raiza'ha Mining Corporation
is one such company

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.854 position:50% align:center
located in the Ruins of Detmolt,

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:53.400 position:50% align:center

now finds himself.

Mister Saruyama's
dancing naked again!

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:06.496 position:50% align:center
Looks that way.

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.873 position:50% align:center
[GRUNT H] You can't go down
that route, Mister Saruyama!

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:12.043 position:50% align:center
It's a different
division's area!

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:14.629 position:50% align:center
Oh, Ninomiya, hey.
If you're curious about

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:16.756 position:50% align:center
last month's results,
I got 'em right here.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.049 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] I'm good.

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:20.468 position:50% align:center
[GOBLIN BOSS]
Yeah, good for nothing!

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:23.638 position:50% align:center
You think only reaching 15%
of your quota's acceptable?

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:25.348 position:50% align:center
Because your sorry
butt was dragging,

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:28.143 position:50% align:center
our entire team's evaluation
got dropped a level!

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:30.270 position:50% align:center
Last month I wasn't
feeling well.

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:31.980 position:50% align:center
[GOBLIN BOSS] You're meant to
put your back into your work

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:33.690 position:50% align:center
until it breaks,
so that's natural!

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.150 position:50% align:center
When I was your age,

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:37.402 position:50% align:center
if I didn't have some type
of ailment from my job, I--!

00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:39.195 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Screw that guy!

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:43.366 position:50% align:center
Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit,
dammit, dammit, dammit!

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.452 position:50% align:center
It's not fair.

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.787 position:50% align:center
Why's an awesome guy
like me gotta toil away

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:51.041 position:50% align:center
in the mines with those
pathetic losers?

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:53.752 position:50% align:center
And for 16-hour shifts
that barely allow time

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:55.587 position:50% align:center
for proper rest in between!

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.380 position:50% align:center
Then they've got us
packed in the same dorm

00:04:57.464 --> 00:05:00.050 position:50% align:center
with zero privacy, sleeping
side-by-stinky-side

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.344 position:50% align:center
'cause we can only
bathe once a month!

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:08.308 position:50% align:center
It's plain wrong! Why am I in
this idiotic world? Why me?

[WANIBE]
Uh, yes, sir? What is it?

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:18.026 position:50% align:center
I told you that if you don't
know how to do something,

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:19.319 position:50% align:center
ask someone who does!

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:22.113 position:50% align:center
So why did you just do
what I saw you do?

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:24.532 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] Well, you also told me
I should learn by watching,

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:25.992 position:50% align:center
so, um...

Yes!

[KINJI] I made 130 thousand
gold last month,

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:42.634 position:50% align:center
but thanks to the debt
I've accumulated,

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center
that only leaves ten thousand
in pocket money.

Never thought there'd
come a time in my life

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:49.974 position:50% align:center
where a loaf of bread
seems like a feast.

Uh?! Uh! No! Please, come back!

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:56.398 position:50% align:center

Wanibe, right? You got a sec?

Um. Should I know you?

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:29.806 position:50% align:center
I know we're on the same team,
but that's it.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.850 position:50% align:center
I also know the
team leader got mad

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:33.727 position:50% align:center
when you went missing
this afternoon.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.563 position:50% align:center
If you're the same Ninomiya
he was talking about.

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:40.150 position:50% align:center
Heh. You should ignore that
little gremlin like I do.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:43.903 position:50% align:center
And isn't this restaurant
a little on the expensive side?

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:45.363 position:50% align:center
We get paid the same wages,

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:47.907 position:50% align:center
so how can you afford your
own dinner, let alone mine?

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:49.242 position:50% align:center
I'm flat broke.

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:50.118 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:52.662 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
I took out a loan.

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:54.164 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
If the rumors are true,

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:56.583 position:50% align:center
you already owe ten
million gold, right?

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:59.294 position:50% align:center
Way off, it's 20 million gold.

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:00.337 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.504 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
There was a time I had even

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:04.049 position:50% align:center
less than what I've got now.

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:05.592 position:50% align:center
I sought out some buyers
I deemed appropriate

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:10.055 position:50% align:center
and tried to make a few bucks
using the only asset I had.

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:11.514 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:14.017 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Thing is, I never
said it would last forever.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.811 position:50% align:center
But even after I told them
that they still beat me up.

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:19.939 position:50% align:center
I mean, how petty
can commoners be?

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:21.858 position:50% align:center
Now, I'm stuck working
this dead-end job

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:23.943 position:50% align:center
thanks to one little mistake.

00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:25.487 position:50% align:center
I just thought of something.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.323 position:50% align:center
I have an urgent appointment,
so I really should be going.

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:31.326 position:50% align:center
To practice reciting
the Three R's?

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:35.163 position:50% align:center
You have a dull look about you.
The look of a guy with no money,

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:37.707 position:50% align:center
no specialties,
and nothing to anticipate

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.542 position:50% align:center
when he wakes up in the morning.

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:42.420 position:50% align:center
Don't pass up a golden
opportunity like this.

Sorry, what?

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:46.257 position:50% align:center
This is a chance for you
to stop being you,

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
and start being better!

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.931 position:50% align:center

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:54.808 position:50% align:center
Where did you go yesterday
when you skipped out?

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:55.684 position:50% align:center
Question for you.

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:57.102 position:50% align:center
What?

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:59.062 position:50% align:center
I was wondering if we
could go on a prospecting tour.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:03.858 position:50% align:center
Huh? Huh...? Really?
You would do that for us?

00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:06.861 position:50% align:center
Heh! So you've finally grown
a backbone, have you?

00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:08.947 position:50% align:center
Well, better late than never!

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.740 position:50% align:center
I still have a few
more words for you,

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:12.450 position:50% align:center
but I'll leave it at
"good luck" for now.

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:13.868 position:50% align:center
You won't be getting
workers' comp

00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:16.996 position:50% align:center
if you're hurt down there,
but--details!

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.165 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] "Prospecting tour"
is a codename used

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:21.459 position:50% align:center
at the Raiza'ha Mining
Corporation.

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:24.004 position:50% align:center
It's when a small party
of employees ventures

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:26.881 position:50% align:center
through the dungeon
in search of demonite.

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:28.883 position:50% align:center
Kinji and his colleagues
typically work on the

00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:32.137 position:50% align:center
first floor, but the mineshafts
go far deeper.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.847 position:50% align:center
And the further down one goes,

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.766 position:50% align:center
the more dangerous the
monsters that lurk there.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.810 position:50% align:center
That said...

00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:40.645 position:50% align:center
Demonite from even
one floor below

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:43.481 position:50% align:center
the surface is worth ten times
as much. And if we find

00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:47.402 position:50% align:center
any rare ore, we get a nice,
fat bonus come payday.

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:50.655 position:50% align:center
True. But is a bonus
worth the risk?

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:52.782 position:50% align:center
I hope you know there
are numerous casualties

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:55.702 position:50% align:center
in the Exploration Division
every single year.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:57.412 position:50% align:center
Observe.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:03.376 position:50% align:center
Where did it go?

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.128 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Through a hidden portal!

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:08.715 position:50% align:center
One that leads to the third
floor of the dungeon.

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:11.092 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
A-Are you sure this is safe?

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:13.178 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Worry not my fine, scaly friend!

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:15.221 position:50% align:center
I scoped it out yesterday!

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:17.015 position:50% align:center
A leather cape and
adventurer's armor

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:20.101 position:50% align:center
isn't really all that much
in terms of equipment.

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:21.603 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Stop knocking our gear.

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:24.564 position:50% align:center
We're not looking for a fight,
so who cares?

00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:29.944 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:35.575 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Bingo.

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:39.579 position:50% align:center
Amazing. All of this
is Demonite?

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:44.584 position:50% align:center
Is this holy water
for warding off evil?

00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:47.921 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Should keep the
baddies at bay for a while.

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:49.297 position:50% align:center
You start mining the left side

00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:51.549 position:50% align:center
and I'll be doing the
same on the right.

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:53.635 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
Oh. Okay.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.724 position:50% align:center
I should thank you, Ninomiya.

00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:02.310 position:50% align:center
You've probably noticed
how slow I am.

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:03.895 position:50% align:center
Always takes me a minute or two

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:06.231 position:50% align:center
to get a handle
on things at work.

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:10.110 position:50% align:center
It's been a while since
anybody asked for my help.

00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:12.153 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:14.489 position:50% align:center
You didn't strike me as
someone who has many friends,

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:16.866 position:50% align:center
so I chose you
out of convenience.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.660 position:50% align:center
Wait, what do you mean?

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:21.538 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Most of our crewmates
are wimps that clump together.

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.248 position:50% align:center
They're powerless
to make a difference,

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:26.126 position:50% align:center
but still grumble
about every little thing.

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:27.836 position:50% align:center
They do unproductive grunt work,

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:29.713 position:50% align:center
then somehow find
a way to look down

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:32.507 position:50% align:center
on those above them even from
the bottom of the pyramid.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:33.675 position:50% align:center
A plague upon the world,

00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:36.511 position:50% align:center
spreading stagnation
like a disease.

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:40.974 position:50% align:center
I refuse to employ anyone
like that if I can help it.

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:43.309 position:50% align:center
Cuz winners like me
have no use for them!

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:44.853 position:50% align:center
And I've never met
a winner in my life

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:48.231 position:50% align:center
who worked just for
the sake of it!

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:51.443 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] Ha, ha! We got
a lot more than expected.

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:53.486 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Yep. We'll be
well within the black

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.864 position:50% align:center
despite the expenses it cost us.

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:58.033 position:50% align:center
And our pockets are
only gonna get fuller

00:10:58.116 --> 00:11:01.369 position:50% align:center
if we can monopolize
this entire level!

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:04.456 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] No doubt our haul
will take the boss by surprise.

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:07.417 position:50% align:center
Prospecting tours don't often
yield results like this!

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.127 position:50% align:center
Who cares what he thinks?

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.879 position:50% align:center
Remind me to tell you
about the importance

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:14.174 position:50% align:center
of individualism and
personal happiness later.

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:16.676 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center
[DRAGON] Hello, my next meal.
How are you?

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:33.860 position:50% align:center
[DRAGON]
What? They're gone.

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:38.656 position:50% align:center
The holy water had no effect?

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.076 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
These expired three years ago!

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:45.163 position:50% align:center
That old hag played me
like a freaking fiddle!

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:47.749 position:50% align:center
Hey, dinner!
Where'd you run off to?

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:49.376 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE, KINJI whimper]

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:51.169 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Come on, give me a break.

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:54.297 position:50% align:center
Is this really how
I'm going to die?

00:11:54.381 --> 00:11:57.967 position:50% align:center
No. It can't be. Not when
I'm so close to reclaiming

00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.552 position:50% align:center
my sweet NEET-hood.

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:02.138 position:50% align:center
Some oversized lizard
is not gonna slam

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:05.266 position:50% align:center
that door in my face!

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.019 position:50% align:center
I just thought up a
pretty decent plan.

00:12:08.103 --> 00:12:10.355 position:50% align:center
Huh? You did, really?

00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:13.483 position:50% align:center
Jump out. Act as a decoy.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:14.984 position:50% align:center
Uh? Excuse me?

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:16.986 position:50% align:center
I thought you said
you had a decent plan.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.489 position:50% align:center
Have a little faith in me?

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:21.574 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
How could I trust that face?

00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:23.576 position:50% align:center
Hasn't our time together
meant anything to you?

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.203 position:50% align:center
I just met you yesterday!

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:28.206 position:50% align:center
Aw, don't be like
that, pal. Huh?!

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:29.749 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:42.012 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE grunting]
Ninomiya! Please help me!

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:44.264 position:50% align:center
Huh?! He ran away?

00:12:44.347 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50% align:center
Yummy. Get in my tummy!

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:52.772 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
Father. Mother. I'm sorry.

00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:54.983 position:50% align:center
Please don't mourn me
for too long.

00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:57.360 position:50% align:center
Hold it, ugly!

00:12:57.444 --> 00:12:58.987 position:50% align:center
You didn't run after all!

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.614 position:50% align:center
So now I have
dinner and dessert.

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:05.368 position:50% align:center
This entrance had better be
part of your "decent plan"!

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:08.371 position:50% align:center
I hate being looked down on
more than anything in the world!

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:09.414 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
Hm?

00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:11.041 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Know what I mean, big guy?

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:13.501 position:50% align:center
Someone of your stature can
empathize with me on this one,

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:14.377 position:50% align:center
I'm sure.

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:17.839 position:50% align:center
I'm not a "big guy." I'm Rim.

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:19.591 position:50% align:center
Guess even monsters have names.

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:22.177 position:50% align:center
All right then, Rim!

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.262 position:50% align:center
Let's you and I make a deal.

00:13:24.346 --> 00:13:25.638 position:50% align:center
What kind of deal?

00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:28.350 position:50% align:center
I am an extraordinarily
superb human specimen!

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:30.268 position:50% align:center
Like, my assets have assets!

00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:32.562 position:50% align:center
So if you protect us from
other monsters till we have

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:33.855 position:50% align:center
our fair share of demonite

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:36.024 position:50% align:center
instead of eating us
for one meal,

00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:37.942 position:50% align:center
then I'll provide you
with food that can make

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:41.696 position:50% align:center
your taste buds sing in ways
our flesh never could.

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:53.333 position:50% align:center
[DRAGON roars, laughs]

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:57.420 position:50% align:center
[DRAGON]
Interesting! Very interesting!

00:13:57.504 --> 00:14:01.841 position:50% align:center
I've met a lot of humans in
my life, but none like you.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.647 position:50% align:center
So be it.

00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:26.408 position:50% align:center
You win. I accept
the terms of this deal.

00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:28.910 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you, tiny human.

00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:36.626 position:50% align:center
[KINJI laughs] Do you feel that,
Mister Wanibe?

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.045 position:50% align:center
The fierce winds of victory
are blowing a storm

00:14:39.129 --> 00:14:41.589 position:50% align:center
of success my way!

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:45.260 position:50% align:center
[GOBLIN BOSS]
Oh-hoo-hoo!

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:46.845 position:50% align:center
Our division's
numbers aren't doin'

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:48.263 position:50% align:center
too shabby this month!

00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:50.015 position:50% align:center
You love to see it!

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:51.808 position:50% align:center
It's all thanks to Ninomiya

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:54.519 position:50% align:center
and the plentiful prospecting
tour he did for us!

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:57.897 position:50% align:center
Go team! [laughs]

00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:00.942 position:50% align:center
[GOBLIN BOSS] Since it appears
to work, good luck!

00:15:01.026 --> 00:15:05.488 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Damn it.
How did it come to this?

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:07.782 position:50% align:center
Our deal was supposed
to make prospecting tours

00:15:07.866 --> 00:15:10.368 position:50% align:center
a breeze while simultaneously
opening other doors

00:15:10.452 --> 00:15:13.079 position:50% align:center
to make money by using Rim.

00:15:13.163 --> 00:15:14.497 position:50% align:center
But my Engel's
coefficient has been

00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:17.459 position:50% align:center
over 100% just keeping her fed!

00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:19.377 position:50% align:center
I brought the
ultimate free-loader

00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:22.464 position:50% align:center
into my personal budget!

00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:29.179 position:50% align:center
More. I have to make
even more money!

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:34.184 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:36.478 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
Ninomiya. Look.

00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:38.271 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Huh...?

00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:39.814 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
There are a bunch of magic items

00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:42.025 position:50% align:center
littered around this place.

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:44.611 position:50% align:center
Where'd they come from?

00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:47.447 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] More importantly,
are they valuable?

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.700 position:50% align:center
This looks pretty
worn out to me.

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:54.454 position:50% align:center
[RIM] Oh. Rim uses this
area for a toilet.

00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:56.164 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:15:56.247 --> 00:16:02.379 position:50% align:center
So this pile of junk is stuff
that you couldn't digest?

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:05.757 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't there be some colossal
dragon droppings around here?

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.384 position:50% align:center
[RIM] Everything that
goes through my system

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:09.427 position:50% align:center
becomes magic power, dummy.

00:16:09.511 --> 00:16:12.138 position:50% align:center
And speaking of digestion,
I'm really hungry.

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:14.391 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Is there ever a
time you're not hungry?

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.893 position:50% align:center
Kinji, feed me now!
I'm hungry! I'm hungry!

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:19.521 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Simmer down for a sec.

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:22.565 position:50% align:center
I don't have any snacks
on me at the moment.

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:28.780 position:50% align:center
By all means, sate your
appetite with this.

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:31.241 position:50% align:center
[KINJI gasps]
Hey, don't eat that

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:33.118 position:50% align:center
we gotta put it on
ice or something!

00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:34.828 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] There is nothing
to be concerned about.

00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:37.205 position:50% align:center
It will eventually grow back.

00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:39.541 position:50% align:center
Ma'am, I am currently idling.

00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:42.168 position:50% align:center
Input your next
command when ready.

00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:43.962 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Did you lose your mind somewhere

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:45.213 position:50% align:center
in the last five minutes?

00:16:45.296 --> 00:16:47.674 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
I smell weird magic powers.

00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:49.968 position:50% align:center
He could be hypnotized
or something.

00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:52.178 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Huh?

00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:57.809 position:50% align:center
Wait, don't tell me...
It's because of this scepter?

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:03.732 position:50% align:center
[KINJI cackles] Welcome to
happy work time, gentlemen!

00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:06.192 position:50% align:center
Put your backs into
it until they break!

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:08.695 position:50% align:center
That sound like a plan to you?

00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:10.739 position:50% align:center
[GRUNTS]
Yes, sir, an excellent plan!

00:17:10.822 --> 00:17:12.907 position:50% align:center
[GRUNT I groaning]

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:15.535 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] You, there!
Why are you slacking off?!

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:17.662 position:50% align:center
Sorry, sir, my pickaxe broke.

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:20.623 position:50% align:center
Then use your hands! New plan!

00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:23.460 position:50% align:center
Break your finger bones
along with your spine!

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:25.253 position:50% align:center
[GRUNT I]
Y-Yes, sir.

00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:28.256 position:50% align:center
Whoa...

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:31.384 position:50% align:center
This Sleepwalker Staff might
just be the most beautiful thing

00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:33.303 position:50% align:center
I've ever laid my eyes on.

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:35.722 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you actually
pooped out an item

00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:41.686 position:50% align:center
that brainwashes people and
enables me to take full control.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.188 position:50% align:center
It's pure insanity!

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:46.274 position:50% align:center
There isn't the tiniest glimmer
of life behind those eyes!

00:17:46.358 --> 00:17:50.153 position:50% align:center
They put even the most obedient
corporate drones to shame!

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:53.114 position:50% align:center
Except it's wrong.
Everything about it's wrong.

00:17:53.198 --> 00:17:54.699 position:50% align:center
Deceiving and
manipulating people

00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:57.452 position:50% align:center
like this is a crime no
matter how you spin it.

00:17:57.535 --> 00:17:59.204 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
You're ignoring the plus side!

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:00.455 position:50% align:center
Or haven't you noticed we've

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:02.832 position:50% align:center
more than doubled our
production of demonite?

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:05.168 position:50% align:center
All I'm doing is raising
their performance effectively

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:06.461 position:50% align:center
and efficiently!

00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:07.671 position:50% align:center
How is that wrong?

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:08.922 position:50% align:center
My share's slightly bigger,

00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:11.299 position:50% align:center
but the guy in charge
should get a hefty cut!

00:18:11.383 --> 00:18:13.677 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
Ah...

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.595 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] Why does he
have so much confidence

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:18.682 position:50% align:center
when the things he's saying
are so obviously twisted?

00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:20.517 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Thus, Kinji continued to trick

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.561 position:50% align:center
his spellbound coworkers
into mining tons, and tons,

00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:26.815 position:50% align:center
and tons of demonite crystals.

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:33.363 position:50% align:center
[KINJI sighs]
Life is perfection.

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:35.699 position:50% align:center
It's as if the stars aligned
for the sole purpose

00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:37.367 position:50% align:center
of putting those
mindless meat-sacks

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.536 position:50% align:center
to work for the greater good.

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:42.080 position:50% align:center
True destiny.

00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:47.502 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna venture a guess here

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:50.005 position:50% align:center
and say you didn't rinse
yourself off first, huh?

00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:51.840 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
Too much trouble.

00:18:51.923 --> 00:18:53.383 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Says the trouble.

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:55.593 position:50% align:center
Hey! Are you taking
a leak right now?

00:18:55.677 --> 00:18:57.595 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
It feels good.

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:02.392 position:50% align:center
Lately, I'm so tired
I can barely function.

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:04.477 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. I'm the same way.

00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:07.147 position:50% align:center
'N' my scales are dry 'cause
I'm not shedding right.

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.858 position:50% align:center
I just want the room
to stop spinning.

00:19:09.941 --> 00:19:11.651 position:50% align:center
But you really can't argue

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:16.573 position:50% align:center
with the numbers we've
been cranking out.

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:18.450 position:50% align:center
[GRUNTS groaning]

00:19:20.535 --> 00:19:23.079 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Report, remind, review!

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:25.582 position:50% align:center
Don't forget the three R's!
What are they?

00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:28.918 position:50% align:center
[GRUNTS]
Report, remind, review...

00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:33.506 position:50% align:center
Where's your enthusiasm?
Shout it like you meant it! Go!

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.675 position:50% align:center
[GOBLIN BOSS] The heck does
he get his all energy from?

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:37.010 position:50% align:center
I'd love to know.

00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:40.096 position:50% align:center
[GRUNT L]
Yeah...

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.183 position:50% align:center
Please, sir. I don't
wanna work anymore!

00:19:43.266 --> 00:19:45.435 position:50% align:center
Spare me!

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:47.312 position:50% align:center
Okay, what's this guy's deal?

00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:49.898 position:50% align:center
Brainwashed people don't
say such selfish things.

00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:52.692 position:50% align:center
Why isn't that staff still
controlling my staff?

00:19:52.776 --> 00:19:56.529 position:50% align:center
Huh. It looks normal
enough to me.

00:19:58.865 --> 00:20:02.619 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Work efficiency is
gradually beginning to drop.

00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:05.121 position:50% align:center
Probably be best to have
clear goals for them.

00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:07.165 position:50% align:center
Redistribute the
division of labor.

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:09.793 position:50% align:center
--[WANIBE] Um, Ninomiya?
--Hm?

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:12.545 position:50% align:center
I bought all of those potions
that you requested of me.

00:20:12.629 --> 00:20:13.588 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Good.

00:20:13.672 --> 00:20:14.839 position:50% align:center
Although, I couldn't
afford enough

00:20:14.923 --> 00:20:17.342 position:50% align:center
for the whole team with
the funds you provided.

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:20.595 position:50% align:center
Not a problem. Water 'em
down then hand 'em out.

00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:22.847 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
But that's just cruel!

00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:24.224 position:50% align:center
They should expect
this sort of thing

00:20:24.307 --> 00:20:26.810 position:50% align:center
if they're not
meeting their quotas.

00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:28.186 position:50% align:center
Okay, listen.

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:29.354 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Yes...?

00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:31.648 position:50% align:center
Every last employee
is at his wits' end.

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:33.983 position:50% align:center
This whole thing's
bound to blow up.

00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:36.528 position:50% align:center
Why not call it off
now and apologize?

00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:40.907 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Not this again. If I
stop, how will we turn a profit?

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.283 position:50% align:center
And once their minds are clear,

00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:44.160 position:50% align:center
they're bound to start
sniffing around for answers,

00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:45.620 position:50% align:center
which'll lead 'em to
our secret passage

00:20:45.704 --> 00:20:47.872 position:50% align:center
and our advantage will be gone.

00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:51.001 position:50% align:center
Besides, this is the happiest
I've ever seen them.

00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:53.712 position:50% align:center
Rim! Raise the power
output of the staff!

00:20:53.795 --> 00:20:55.130 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunting]

00:20:55.213 --> 00:20:58.258 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] You know what?
People like to offer support.

00:20:58.341 --> 00:21:03.054 position:50% align:center
It's biologically engrained in
them to want to help each other.

00:21:03.138 --> 00:21:04.139 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:21:04.222 --> 00:21:07.142 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:08.560 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:11.813 position:50% align:center
Yes. No one would
ever rise to the top

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:15.400 position:50% align:center
without a foundation of
weak flunkies to crawl up!

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:17.777 position:50% align:center
I'll springboard off the
sweaty and broken backs

00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:20.864 position:50% align:center
of these pawns and soar
high above the masses!

00:21:20.947 --> 00:21:23.116 position:50% align:center
So whaddaya say,
all you corporate grunts?

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:24.409 position:50% align:center
You may feel like you're dying,

00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:27.162 position:50% align:center
but your deaths will make
my dreams come true!

00:21:27.245 --> 00:21:30.832 position:50% align:center
Give your master everything
you've got and then some!

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:37.005 position:50% align:center
[KINJI laughs]

00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:39.466 position:50% align:center
Um. You guys okay?

00:21:39.549 --> 00:21:43.803 position:50% align:center
[GOBLIN BOSS] I'm gonna
rip out that stupid hair!

00:21:48.683 --> 00:21:52.687 position:50% align:center
[KINJI groaning]

00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:54.522 position:50% align:center
I'm getting hungry again.

00:21:54.606 --> 00:21:57.859 position:50% align:center
Unless you're lookin' for pound
cake, I got nothin' for ya.

00:21:57.942 --> 00:21:59.486 position:50% align:center
I said I would
keep you protected

00:21:59.569 --> 00:22:01.279 position:50% align:center
if you manage to keep me full.

00:22:01.363 --> 00:22:04.574 position:50% align:center
So, guess who's on the menu
if you can't pull through.

00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:06.117 position:50% align:center
No!

00:22:06.201 --> 00:22:09.579 position:50% align:center
[KINJI screaming]

00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:10.789 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Kinji Ninomiya.

00:22:10.872 --> 00:22:13.625 position:50% align:center
Present occupation:
"Corporate Grunt."

00:22:13.708 --> 00:22:15.085 position:50% align:center
Will he escape the sorrow

00:22:15.168 --> 00:22:17.128 position:50% align:center
of this exploitative
company culture?

00:22:17.212 --> 00:22:19.673 position:50% align:center
[KINJI screaming]
