00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:25.483 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Hm?

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.071 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Mind-control your
co-workers for a few days,

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:32.157 position:50% align:center
and suddenly
everybody hates you.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.284 position:50% align:center
Our numbers are the best
they've ever been!

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.535 position:50% align:center
They should be on
their hands and knees

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:38.079 position:50% align:center
thanking me for taking charge!

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:41.958 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Hm?

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.878 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] Wait, boss!
Is this some kind of joke?

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:46.713 position:50% align:center
Nope, couldn't be more serious.

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:49.174 position:50% align:center
Because of all the progress
you made on the third floor,

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:51.634 position:50% align:center
you managed to catch
the eye of the higher ups.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.971 position:50% align:center
Um. But sir.
There's been some mistake!

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.348 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna die!

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.350 position:50% align:center
[GOBLIN BOSS] Quit your
bellyaching and get to work!

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:03.938 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] I mean. But...
This is... Well. Okay.

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:39.868 position:50% align:center

You can't just lay down and die!

Ninomiya! Help! Hey!

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:05.685 position:50% align:center
This company is crap! And I
mean crap with a capital C!

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.312 position:50% align:center

Please...!

[NARRATOR]
The Raiza'ha Mining Corporation

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.483 position:50% align:center
is headquartered in
the city of Torstone.

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:13.902 position:50% align:center
Calling it massive would
be putting it mildly,

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:16.363 position:50% align:center
what with a capital
of 1.3 billion gold

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:18.865 position:50% align:center
and some 30 thousand employees.

00:03:18.948 --> 00:03:21.326 position:50% align:center
It primarily deals
in demonite crystals,

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.161 position:50% align:center
a lucrative market
that has only grown

00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:25.330 position:50% align:center
since the industrial revolution.

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:28.500 position:50% align:center
And they do it all.
Research and development.

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:29.834 position:50% align:center
Selling and distribution.

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:33.004 position:50% align:center
And, of course, surveying
demonite-rich dungeons.

00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:35.590 position:50% align:center
There isn't a facet they
don't have their hands on.

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:38.885 position:50% align:center
Naturally, exploration forms the
core of Raiza'ha's collective

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:41.596 position:50% align:center
revenue, thus the department
is highly specialized

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.723 position:50% align:center
and split into
multiple divisions.

00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:45.183 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:47.352 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] One noteworthy
subdivision is Group Three.

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:49.729 position:50% align:center
This team is tasked with
protecting and expanding

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:52.691 position:50% align:center
excavation sites by
hunting large monsters,

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:54.818 position:50% align:center
ensuring production
stays on track.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.277 position:50% align:center
These are what
one would consider

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:59.864 position:50% align:center
"the money makers"
or "the elite."

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:02.075 position:50% align:center
[KRUTZ yells]

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.081 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Ninomiya's new
team, Group Eight,

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:10.375 position:50% align:center
assists these
frontline fighters.

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:12.335 position:50% align:center
Their work consists of
miscellaneous chores

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.045 position:50% align:center
too minor for anyone else.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.964 position:50% align:center
Things like cleaning up
mob monsters

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:18.091 position:50% align:center
and refilling treasure-chest
storage boxes

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:20.343 position:50% align:center
with support items are
right up their alley.

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:23.263 position:50% align:center
In other words, those
with any brains or skills,

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:26.349 position:50% align:center
would never be caught
dead in that group.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:32.689 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] This sucks. I'm risking
my life for this job,

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:35.108 position:50% align:center
yet still up to
my eyeballs in debt.

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:37.444 position:50% align:center
Surprised I'm not dehydrated
from all the salt

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:39.487 position:50% align:center
in my wounds. Damn it!

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:43.033 position:50% align:center
I swear I'm gonna find
a way outta this hole.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.869 position:50% align:center
--[WANIBE] Um, Ninomiya?
--What?

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:48.371 position:50% align:center
Is this really how I'm going
to spend the rest of my life?

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:50.290 position:50% align:center
Stuck in the shadows
of a dreary pit,

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:52.042 position:50% align:center
working an unfulfilling job?

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:56.129 position:50% align:center
Like, will anyone even
remember my contributions?

00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:57.756 position:50% align:center
Y'know, pessimism's contagious

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:01.968 position:50% align:center
and this cave's
depressing enough as it is.

00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:03.303 position:50% align:center
Well, not me!

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:05.347 position:50% align:center
I don't care how many
toes I have to step on

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.098 position:50% align:center
or how much trouble I cause!

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:09.267 position:50% align:center
My life will be both
full and rewarding

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:11.519 position:50% align:center
and nothing's gonna change that!

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:13.146 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE gasping]

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.484 position:50% align:center
I say we wrap up and go
pound a few pints, okay?

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:20.153 position:50% align:center
Or since we can't afford it...

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:22.947 position:50% align:center

piss the bartender off.

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:24.574 position:50% align:center

[OGRE BOSS] You're truly
idiots among idiots.

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:13.581 position:50% align:center
The route you guys were
assigned is relatively safe,

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:16.292 position:50% align:center
but you still found a way
to muck it up.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:19.587 position:50% align:center
Well, since Wanibe will be
out of commission for a while,

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.673 position:50% align:center
you're just going to have
to pick up his slack.

--Huh?
--In addition,

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:25.010 position:50% align:center
every last one of

00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:27.929 position:50% align:center
into that treasure chest monster
will be deducted from your pay.

straight up crazy!

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.308 position:50% align:center
Enough talk.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:36.688 position:50% align:center

[KINJI] Do Wanibe's work on top
of mine? Psh, impossible!

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:44.279 position:50% align:center
I can barely finish my
own workload in a day,

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:46.364 position:50% align:center

to do his, too?

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:48.324 position:50% align:center
Damn it.

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:58.043 position:50% align:center
What the--? Where's the rest
of the trash I just took out?

00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:01.254 position:50% align:center
Maybe some cats stole it.

The heck is this?

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:07.260 position:50% align:center

00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:09.429 position:50% align:center
I know you're hungry.

[KINJI]The people here treat
fatty meats like garbage,

so I got that thing dirt-cheap!

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:34.496 position:50% align:center
Their trash was my
hefty hunk of treasure!

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.498 position:50% align:center
I love meat so much.

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:38.833 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Don't you dare!

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:44.297 position:50% align:center
Again! One thing after another
is snatched from my grasp!

00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:49.010 position:50% align:center
[DWARF A]
Here ya go.

00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:52.347 position:50% align:center
I need you to refill treasure
boxes with these items here.

Good luck.

You're gonna need it
with a load this big.

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:57.727 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:59.979 position:50% align:center
Before you hop to it, though...

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:01.815 position:50% align:center
Be careful with this one.

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:04.401 position:50% align:center
There're some rather
expensive potions in here.

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:07.821 position:50% align:center
We'd have to work three months
straight in order to afford 'em.

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:10.782 position:50% align:center
Just do your best
not to drop it.

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:13.284 position:50% align:center
Sure.

[KINJI] Kinji.
Is this who you've become?

The obedient pleb
that nods along

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:20.375 position:50% align:center
without a second thought?

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:22.669 position:50% align:center
Is this actually me?

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:25.839 position:50% align:center
A torrential, unidentifiable
force of great magnitude

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:30.051 position:50% align:center
is slowly chipping away at the
very spiritual core of my being!

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:31.469 position:50% align:center
Sooner or later,

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:35.348 position:50% align:center
this crap-tastic company
is gonna destroy me.

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:37.517 position:50% align:center

something about it!

[KRUTZ]
Monsters are on my tail!

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.279 position:50% align:center
But since I lucked
out running into you,

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:51.281 position:50% align:center
you can buy me time
so I can escape!

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:52.365 position:50% align:center
Tch.

00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:53.950 position:50% align:center
Don't give me a look like that!

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:57.078 position:50% align:center

so shut up and do what I say!

00:08:57.162 --> 00:09:00.331 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] I know you're not asking
a favor with that attitude.

'Cause all dungeon
ants are like that!

[KINJI]
Well, what're you waiting for?

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:24.606 position:50% align:center
Take them out,
Mister "Elite Group Three!"

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:26.858 position:50% align:center
If they didn't have
strength in numbers, I would!

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:29.694 position:50% align:center
But I got separated
from my crew!

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:33.782 position:50% align:center
Hey! It's time to sink or swim!

00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:38.328 position:50% align:center
What? [screams]

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:44.292 position:50% align:center
[ANTS grunting]

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:47.796 position:50% align:center
[GUARDS laughing]

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:50.298 position:50% align:center
[DWARF A] Wow. Didn't expect
you'd finish so fast.

00:09:50.382 --> 00:09:52.384 position:50% align:center
[BOTH panting]

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:54.177 position:50% align:center
I need to borrow your phone!

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.597 position:50% align:center
Wait a second.
You're a mess. What happened?

00:09:57.681 --> 00:09:59.057 position:50% align:center
[KRUTZ] What do you think
happened, old man?

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.767 position:50% align:center
Come on, answer already!

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.852 position:50% align:center
Long story short, there's
a horde of dungeon ants

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:04.020 position:50% align:center
headed this way!

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:06.398 position:50% align:center
You, uh, hit your head
or something?

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:09.484 position:50% align:center
Must have. 'Cause an elite
like you should know better.

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:12.278 position:50% align:center
Monsters are extremely
territorial creatures.

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:14.739 position:50% align:center
So even though the ones from
the deeper levels are stronger,

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:18.618 position:50% align:center
they never come topside.
And I mean never.

00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Huh? What'd you say?

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.288 position:50% align:center
[OGRE BOSS]
Clean out your ears.

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:26.042 position:50% align:center
I said if you can't verify it,
I can't spare the manpower.

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.586 position:50% align:center
More importantly, have you
finished your work for the day?

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.464 position:50% align:center
Hey! I'm being serious, so stop
treating this like a prank!

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:33.091 position:50% align:center
[roaring]

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:34.759 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.601 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:49.774 position:50% align:center
[KRUTZ]
Damn dirty ants!

00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:57.824 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Isn't there anything
useful in this dump?

00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:01.369 position:50% align:center
Uh. You should treat company
property with more care.

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:03.121 position:50% align:center
Anything?!

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:07.751 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] I refuse to believe
we're defenseless.

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:10.545 position:50% align:center
There has to be something!

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:37.030 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Heh. Sometimes
I even amaze myself.

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:39.074 position:50% align:center
Their pea-sized brains
are so confused

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:41.076 position:50% align:center
since they can't
find where we are.

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:43.870 position:50% align:center
[DWARF A]
But it's only a temporary fix.

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:46.039 position:50% align:center
I will say using a
transformation potion

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:48.291 position:50% align:center
with a monster part was
a pretty gutsy move.

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:49.918 position:50% align:center
I never would've
thought of that.

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:52.170 position:50% align:center
And it actually worked!

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:55.173 position:50% align:center
I suppose all's well
that ends well, for now.

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:57.717 position:50% align:center
That said, shame
on you for using

00:11:57.801 --> 00:12:00.053 position:50% align:center
company's products
without permission!

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:02.305 position:50% align:center
[KRUTZ] Guys. Surely we
can have this conversation

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:04.015 position:50% align:center
somewhere safer, yeah?

00:12:04.099 --> 00:12:05.433 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
We're not leaving.

00:12:05.517 --> 00:12:06.476 position:50% align:center
[KRUTZ]
Huh?!

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.478 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
That stupid boss of mine.

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:10.438 position:50% align:center
The instant he caught
wind of our situation,

00:12:10.522 --> 00:12:13.233 position:50% align:center
he sealed off the exit.

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:15.485 position:50% align:center
The three of us have
been abandoned, fellas.

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:17.028 position:50% align:center
[DWARF A]
It can't be.

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:19.531 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] We'll be fine until
the transformation wears off.

00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:22.158 position:50% align:center
But once it does,
we're as good as gone.

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:24.035 position:50% align:center
[KRUTZ] So, what,
we just wait for death?

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:25.662 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Calm down and listen!

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:28.790 position:50% align:center
I'm trying to think of something
that won't immediately kill us.

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:33.712 position:50% align:center
[DWARF A] I'm starting to wonder
if that option even exists.

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:35.338 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Huh?

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:39.592 position:50% align:center
[ANT A]
Unable to proceed.

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:41.177 position:50% align:center
[ANT B]
Understood.

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:44.848 position:50% align:center
[KRUTZ] Heh. I guess we're
the same in that respect.

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:48.476 position:50% align:center
Just up and left for dead.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.646 position:50% align:center
[KINJI gasps] I can understand
what they're saying!

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.690 position:50% align:center
[KRUTZ]
Well, we are officially ants.

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:55.108 position:50% align:center
So we get all their abilities,

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:57.277 position:50% align:center
at least until
the potion wears off.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.112 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
How interesting.

00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:01.740 position:50% align:center
Finally, a decent development.

00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:03.992 position:50% align:center
[KRUTZ] Hey! Where do you
think you're skittering?

00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:05.201 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Watch and learn.

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:06.244 position:50% align:center
[ANT A panting]

00:13:06.327 --> 00:13:08.204 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Are you all right?

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:09.456 position:50% align:center
You're clearly struggling,

00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:11.291 position:50% align:center
but I don't see anyone
coming to help.

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:14.294 position:50% align:center
You better not tell me that's
normal protocol around here.

00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:15.670 position:50% align:center
[ANT A]
Huh?

00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:17.714 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Oof, that was rather
blunt, huh? Pardon me.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:20.759 position:50% align:center
Or are we not speaking
the same language?

00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:21.843 position:50% align:center
[ANT A]
We are.

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:23.511 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Then introductions are in order.

00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:25.013 position:50% align:center
My name is Ninomiya!

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:28.725 position:50% align:center
I'm a traveling worker ant,
but not just any worker ant.

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:31.186 position:50% align:center
I'm also an advisor and
consultant offering support

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:32.854 position:50% align:center
to my fellow laborers.

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:35.148 position:50% align:center
[ANT A]
What kind of support?

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:36.566 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Where should I begin?

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:38.693 position:50% align:center
Guess it all started
with my boss, er,

00:13:38.777 --> 00:13:41.654 position:50% align:center
I mean my queen, and how
narrow-minded she could be.

00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:43.823 position:50% align:center
She was as self-centered
as they come.

00:13:43.907 --> 00:13:46.201 position:50% align:center
So, naturally,
karma caught up with her.

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:49.329 position:50% align:center
And the entire colony collapsed
when it finally did!

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:52.540 position:50% align:center
But you live and you learn and
now I travel the world

00:13:52.624 --> 00:13:54.918 position:50% align:center
and help other ants in hopes
that they never have to suffer

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:57.003 position:50% align:center
through the same tragedy I did.

00:13:57.087 --> 00:14:00.799 position:50% align:center
So when I saw you lying here, my
heart automatically reached out.

00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:03.760 position:50% align:center
I take it your little break
was a result of overexertion.

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:04.886 position:50% align:center
Is that right?

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:06.137 position:50% align:center
[ANT A]
Yes.

00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:08.807 position:50% align:center
[KINJI chuckles]
Then, do tell. How much time off

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.809 position:50% align:center
do they give a hard worker
such as yourself?

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:12.310 position:50% align:center
Two out of seven days?

00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:14.521 position:50% align:center
One out of ten?

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:15.939 position:50% align:center
[ANT A]
Zero.

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:17.857 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] They don't give you
any time to recuperate?!

00:14:17.941 --> 00:14:18.775 position:50% align:center
[ANT A]
Correct.

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:20.402 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
That's just terrible.

00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:21.736 position:50% align:center
Though I've heard
of things like this,

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.488 position:50% align:center
I never thought they were true.

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:26.908 position:50% align:center
They must reward if you're
giving it 110%, 24/7!

00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:28.576 position:50% align:center
How are your superiors
compensating you

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.953 position:50% align:center
for all that you do for them?

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:32.080 position:50% align:center
[ANT A]
They are not.

00:14:32.163 --> 00:14:37.168 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] What?! Unbelievable!
How can your pay be so low?

00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:39.045 position:50% align:center
[KRUTZ]
Ugh, what is that moron doing?

00:14:39.129 --> 00:14:41.256 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] So you're telling me
you work day in and day out

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:43.174 position:50% align:center
with no breaks,
no medical attention,

00:14:43.258 --> 00:14:45.510 position:50% align:center
and no bonuses
despite your efforts!

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:48.096 position:50% align:center
Simply used by the system
till the day you die?

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:50.306 position:50% align:center
Does that about sum it up?

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.144 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Aren't you the least bit angry?

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:56.271 position:50% align:center
[ANT A]
No. Orders.

00:14:56.354 --> 00:15:00.692 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Forget your orders!
You must be a little upset.

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:01.651 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:03.028 position:50% align:center
[ANT A]
Huh?!

00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:04.195 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Think about it!

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:06.156 position:50% align:center
You're a human be--
I mean living being!

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:08.450 position:50% align:center
Were you born merely
to die from overexertion?

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:09.701 position:50% align:center
Not a chance!

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:11.536 position:50% align:center
Your little ant life is
whatever you make it,

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:13.288 position:50% align:center
so surely there
must be something

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:14.998 position:50% align:center
you want to accomplish!

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:18.043 position:50% align:center
And whatever that something is,
it's being stolen from you!

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:20.962 position:50% align:center
You may not have realized it,
but you deserve equality,

00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:22.714 position:50% align:center
regardless of birth and status!

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:24.674 position:50% align:center
You're well within
your rights to express

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:26.843 position:50% align:center
your grievances towards
the ant queen!

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.554 position:50% align:center
[ANT A]
Rights and equality?

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:30.764 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Of course!

00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:32.432 position:50% align:center
Everyone has the right
to voice their concerns

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:34.559 position:50% align:center
about their working environment!

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:36.311 position:50% align:center
[ANT A]
Everyone? Really?

00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:37.979 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Would I lie to you?

00:15:38.063 --> 00:15:39.773 position:50% align:center
[ANT A]
Uh... uh...?

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:41.316 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] And keep this
under your antennae,

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:42.734 position:50% align:center
but I was just about
to hold a meetup

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:45.779 position:50% align:center
for victims such as you
so we can fix the problem!

00:15:45.862 --> 00:15:47.489 position:50% align:center
[ANT A]
Meetup?

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:49.366 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
I'd be delighted to have you!

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:51.368 position:50% align:center
If that's something
you'd be interested in.

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.870 position:50% align:center
[ANT A]
Affirmative.

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:57.374 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] How did I know
they'd make it so easy?

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:59.834 position:50% align:center
It's like teaching a kid who has
yet to learn right from wrong

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:03.004 position:50% align:center
how to use a knife.

00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:05.965 position:50% align:center
May I present our newest member!

00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:07.717 position:50% align:center
[KRUTZ]
Um, member of what, exactly?

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:09.135 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Always such a kidder!

00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:11.054 position:50% align:center
Just make the guy feel
comfortable, okay?

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:12.138 position:50% align:center
[DWARF A sighs]

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:13.390 position:50% align:center
[KRUTZ]
Hey, what the--?

00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:14.808 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] You, with the
long yet pinchy face!

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:17.519 position:50% align:center
Are you unhappy with
your working conditions?

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:21.356 position:50% align:center
[ANTS murmuring]

00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:23.191 position:50% align:center
[KINJI gasps]
You hurt your leg?

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:25.694 position:50% align:center
I certainly hope your
insurance covers that!

00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:28.530 position:50% align:center
That box you're carrying
looks super-duper heavy.

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:31.199 position:50% align:center
What's inside? Is it worth it?

00:16:31.282 --> 00:16:33.535 position:50% align:center
[ANTS murmuring]

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:36.621 position:50% align:center
[DWARF A, KRUTZ]
Uhh...

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:43.378 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Greetings,
my fellow worker ants!

00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:45.964 position:50% align:center
Finally, the time
to act is here!

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:48.216 position:50% align:center
Yes! It's the time
to take a stand!

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:51.136 position:50% align:center
The time to steel yourselves
and rise up against the queen!

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:54.514 position:50% align:center
She has used and abused
you for far too long!

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:57.851 position:50% align:center
[ANTS murmuring]

00:16:57.934 --> 00:17:00.520 position:50% align:center
[ANTS]
Ninomiya! Ninomiya! Ninomiya!

00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:04.733 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Take a look at this,
if you will.

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:07.694 position:50% align:center
[KRUTZ] So, I was
working as I always do...

00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:10.321 position:50% align:center
I'll be. He suckered
you into this?

00:17:10.405 --> 00:17:11.823 position:50% align:center
[KRUTZ chuckles]

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:17.620 position:50% align:center
It breaks my heart to see ants
being taken advantage of.

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:20.331 position:50% align:center
[ANTS]
Ninomiya.

00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:22.584 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] That's why
I will not forsake you!

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:25.253 position:50% align:center
I will fight with you
until we end this tyranny!

00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:27.005 position:50% align:center
[ANTS]
Ninomiya!

00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:30.717 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] It is my dream that
working ants of society unite

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.677 position:50% align:center
and strive for a
better tomorrow!

00:17:32.761 --> 00:17:34.179 position:50% align:center
Who's with me?

00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:35.930 position:50% align:center
[ANTS]
Me!

00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:37.182 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
For worker ants!

00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:44.564 position:50% align:center
[ANTS] Yeah! Ninomiya!
Ninomiya! Ninomiya...

00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:46.983 position:50% align:center
[ANT QUEEN] You said there's
only been 30% progress

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:49.152 position:50% align:center
on Operation Surface Invasion?

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
[VASSAL ANT]
Yes.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.532 position:50% align:center
Well, now, that just won't do.

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:58.328 position:50% align:center
We can't let this chance
to expand our reign

00:17:58.411 --> 00:17:59.454 position:50% align:center
slip through our grasp.

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:00.997 position:50% align:center
Who knows when
that gluttonous demon

00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:03.249 position:50% align:center
will come crawling its way back.

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:07.629 position:50% align:center
Push the workers until
they die from exhaustion.

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:10.006 position:50% align:center
If that's what it takes,
then that's what it takes.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.257 position:50% align:center
[ANTS chattering]

00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:13.927 position:50% align:center
Whatever's making that
racket needs to stop!

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.304 position:50% align:center
[ANTS chattering]

00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:18.723 position:50% align:center
[ANT QUEEN]
What in the--?

00:18:18.807 --> 00:18:20.934 position:50% align:center
Why are you all
dressed like that?

00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:22.977 position:50% align:center
Answer!

00:18:23.061 --> 00:18:25.855 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] I gotta say, you're even
worse than I thought.

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:27.315 position:50% align:center
Working your underlings to death

00:18:27.399 --> 00:18:30.110 position:50% align:center
while you lounge in
the lap of luxury?

00:18:30.193 --> 00:18:31.528 position:50% align:center
Kind of a bad look.

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:34.322 position:50% align:center
Makes you wonder if
you're fit to be queen.

00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:36.908 position:50% align:center
A human? What's the
meaning of this?

00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:38.785 position:50% align:center
How can you possibly
associate yourself

00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:40.120 position:50% align:center
with my minions?

00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:42.580 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] By being comrades
fighting for a cause.

00:18:42.664 --> 00:18:43.998 position:50% align:center
[ANT QUEEN]
Pardon?

00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:45.458 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Isn't that right?

00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:48.003 position:50% align:center
[ANTS chattering]

00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:49.713 position:50% align:center
Worker rights and equality?

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:51.589 position:50% align:center
What buffoonery is this?

00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:56.136 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who matters--
there's no colony without me.

00:18:56.219 --> 00:18:57.554 position:50% align:center
Silence!

00:18:57.637 --> 00:19:00.390 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] It's no use. The guys
are currently connected

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:03.643 position:50% align:center
to me with a bond
of mutual trust.

00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:05.770 position:50% align:center
We can't understand
each other anymore,

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:07.439 position:50% align:center
but the one thing
I'm positive about is

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:09.983 position:50% align:center
the last monster they're going
to take orders from is you!

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:12.027 position:50% align:center
What did you just say?

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:15.238 position:50% align:center
Can ya hear me now?
I hope so.

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:18.283 position:50% align:center
Because you are no longer
qualified to be the queen!

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:21.953 position:50% align:center
[ANT QUEEN] My qualifications?
Is that what this is about?

00:19:22.037 --> 00:19:24.748 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Well, that and your
shocking lack of talent.

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:28.710 position:50% align:center
Oh dear, you couldn't be
more clueless. For you see,

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:32.255 position:50% align:center
a queen does not require
"qualifications" or "talents"

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:37.886 position:50% align:center
in order to rule. But there
is one deciding factor.

00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:39.596 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:46.519 position:50% align:center
All I need is power!

00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:52.984 position:50% align:center
I'll swallow you whole!

00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:54.694 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasping]

00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:09.834 position:50% align:center
Running on fumes
at the moment.

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:12.045 position:50% align:center
[ANT QUEEN gasping]
You're back!

00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:13.505 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hey.

00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:16.383 position:50% align:center
[stomach grumbling]

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:17.258 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
Huh?

00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:18.843 position:50% align:center
[AUNT QUEEN whimpering]

00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:20.303 position:50% align:center
Oh, some snacks.

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:21.554 position:50% align:center
[ANTS screaming]

00:20:21.638 --> 00:20:23.765 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
Wait food. I wanna eat you.

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:25.975 position:50% align:center
Do not eat my new comrades, Rim!

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:27.519 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
Slow down. I'm hungry!

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:32.565 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] I swear. Take this and
leave the worker ants in peace!

00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:38.071 position:50% align:center
[KINJI sighs] Good thing I stole
that from the inventory depot,

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:40.949 position:50% align:center
otherwise this would've
been a bloodbath.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.035 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Huh?

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:46.121 position:50% align:center
[ANTS chattering]

00:20:48.206 --> 00:20:49.791 position:50% align:center
[ANT QUEEN laughs]

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:53.503 position:50% align:center
Wow! You're a hero
after my own heart!

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.841 position:50% align:center
[KRUTZ, DWARF A gasping]

00:20:57.924 --> 00:21:01.136 position:50% align:center
[KINJI chuckles]

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:07.434 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] I'd like to apologize
for all the trouble

00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:08.810 position:50% align:center
I caused you.

00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:11.688 position:50% align:center
I am genuinely sorry.
Taking care of both our

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:14.065 position:50% align:center
workloads could not
have been easy.

00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:17.652 position:50% align:center
Aw! You don't need
to stress over that!

00:21:17.736 --> 00:21:18.987 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:23.742 position:50% align:center
Not sure I've ever seen
you in this good a mood.

00:21:23.825 --> 00:21:26.119 position:50% align:center
I guess you could say it
started when I exterminated

00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:27.287 position:50% align:center
a bunch of dungeon ants

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.372 position:50% align:center
and got a commendation
from the company.

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:33.752 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Um, before you
regale me with that tale,

00:21:33.835 --> 00:21:35.211 position:50% align:center
maybe we should stop walking.

00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:37.339 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Our bosses have some nerve.

00:21:37.422 --> 00:21:39.924 position:50% align:center
We survived after they
knowingly left us to die,

00:21:40.008 --> 00:21:41.051 position:50% align:center
and all they did was slap

00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:43.803 position:50% align:center
a stupid piece of
paper in our hands.

00:21:43.887 --> 00:21:46.514 position:50% align:center
It was such a smoothly
executed betrayal that I was

00:21:46.598 --> 00:21:49.142 position:50% align:center
almost impressed, yet still
too insulted to get there.

00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:51.061 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
Um, Ninomiya?

00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:52.437 position:50% align:center
Did you realize we're on
the second level, or...?

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.397 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
So that got me thinking.

00:21:54.481 --> 00:21:57.025 position:50% align:center
This corrupt company
is in dire need of help.

00:21:57.108 --> 00:21:59.611 position:50% align:center
In dire need of a leader
with exceptional potential,

00:21:59.694 --> 00:22:01.071 position:50% align:center
such as me.

00:22:01.154 --> 00:22:03.323 position:50% align:center
Okay, you lost me.

00:22:03.406 --> 00:22:06.326 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] That's why I've
assembled my own organization,

00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:09.788 position:50% align:center
at least until I can overtake
the Raiza'ha Mining Corporation.

00:22:09.871 --> 00:22:11.915 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
Huh?!

00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:15.293 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Care to join, Wanibe?

00:22:15.377 --> 00:22:19.089 position:50% align:center
There's plenty of room in
the Dungeon Black Company!
