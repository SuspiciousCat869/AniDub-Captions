[BELZA]
What an honor to speak with

00:00:12.303 --> 00:00:15.348 position:50% align:center
the second coming of the
hero herself, Miss Shia.

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:19.185 position:50% align:center
You're far too kind! I'm really
not worthy of that title.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.562 position:50% align:center
[BELZA]
Don't be modest.

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:22.897 position:50% align:center
I've heard quite a bit
about your exploits.

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:24.774 position:50% align:center
Like how you acquired
the Philosopher's Stone

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:28.361 position:50% align:center
on the fifth floor of our Faria
branch's dungeon, for instance.

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:30.280 position:50% align:center
One-hundred eighty-five
other casualties,

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:32.365 position:50% align:center
and yet you remained unscathed.

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.409 position:50% align:center
They were all my
companions, though.

00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:36.453 position:50% align:center
I couldn't have done it
without them.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:38.121 position:50% align:center
We were only successful because

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.206 position:50% align:center
everyone worked so hard
for the company.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.293 position:50% align:center
[BELZA laughs] A fresh group
of promising rookies

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:46.296 position:50% align:center
will soon be returning from
our corporate training retreat.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.756 position:50% align:center
I was hoping you'd
join them here

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.758 position:50% align:center
in Detmolt and
put your skills to use

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:53.303 position:50% align:center
by demonstrating
the Raiza'ha way.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.096 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
You can count on me!

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.639 position:50% align:center
Don't stop, work till you drop,

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.308 position:50% align:center
then keep on working
around the clock

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.477 position:50% align:center
is a motto I've always lived by!

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.314 position:50% align:center
So if it's up to me,
they'll give their everything!

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:08.234 position:50% align:center
[INSTRUCTOR A]
You are no longer people.

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:11.029 position:50% align:center
You are the equivalent of swine,
do I make myself clear?

00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:12.739 position:50% align:center
[GRUNTS]
Thank you very much, sir!

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:14.991 position:50% align:center
Do you suppose livestock
deserve jobs?

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.701 position:50% align:center
[GRUNTS]
Thank you very much, sir!

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:18.620 position:50% align:center
No. That's just crazy talk.

00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:21.956 position:50% align:center
You lot have more in common
with maggots than swine anyway.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.042 position:50% align:center
[GRUNTS]
Thank you very much, sir!

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:28.004 position:50% align:center
[INSTRUCTOR A] Hm? Seems there's
at least one maggot among you

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.382 position:50% align:center
who could benefit from
an attitude adjustment.

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:33.009 position:50% align:center
Uh, thank you very much, sir.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.678 position:50% align:center
I have to admit,
one of the best things

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:36.805 position:50% align:center
about my job is
transforming scum like you

00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:39.140 position:50% align:center
into my favorite kind of pigs.

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:40.475 position:50% align:center
They don't call this place

00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:43.311 position:50% align:center
Pig Pen Isle for nothing,
as you'll soon learn.

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:45.146 position:50% align:center
[DRONE A] Thank you very much,
sir. I will work extremely hard.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.606 position:50% align:center
[INSTRUCTOR A]
Now! Let's head to the dungeon

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.525 position:50% align:center
so you can show me
what you're made of!

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:49.651 position:50% align:center
Get those suits off

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:52.612 position:50% align:center
and change into
your exploration gear!

00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:54.197 position:50% align:center
Assemble here in three minutes!

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.992 position:50% align:center
For each second you're late, you
owe me ten squats! So hustle!

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.877 position:50% align:center
[ELF A screaming]

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.879 position:50% align:center
Please don't eat me!

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:35.965 position:50% align:center
[ELF A whimpering]

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.468 position:50% align:center
I know that you maggots
only have pea-sized brains,

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.804 position:50% align:center
but try and use 'em to figure
out a way to fight that thing!

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:43.306 position:50% align:center
You've gotta be kidding me!

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.558 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
I concocted the perfect plan,

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:48.812 position:50% align:center
and now it's been
rendered useless!

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:51.106 position:50% align:center
Make the ants collect demonite.

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.566 position:50% align:center
Transfer to the group in
the Exploration Division

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.151 position:50% align:center
with the most freedom.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.445 position:50% align:center
Then manipulate the market
using said demonite

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.614 position:50% align:center
and control Raiza'ha
inside and out!

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:01.616 position:50% align:center
Thus making me a
multi-dimensional

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.410 position:50% align:center
King of NEETs!

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:05.954 position:50% align:center
I guess it wasn't meant to be.

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:09.749 position:50% align:center
No! I refuse to let it
go down this way!

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:11.418 position:50% align:center
I am not dying here!

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:14.045 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE whimpers]

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.758 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
Ahhh! What do I do?

00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:20.885 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.554 position:50% align:center
[KINJI grunts]

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:30.061 position:50% align:center
[INSTRUCTOR A] Well, well.
Seems crawling around a dungeon

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:33.064 position:50% align:center
is still asking too much
of maggots like you.

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:35.483 position:50% align:center
By your last day,
prove to me it was worth using

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:37.986 position:50% align:center
this high-level trap
to save your butts.

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.321 position:50% align:center
If you fail to do so,
the next time you see

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:44.617 position:50% align:center
one of these babies explode
will be underneath your feet.

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:47.954 position:50% align:center
Thanks to yesterday's session,

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:50.665 position:50% align:center
it's obvious you worms
lack the basic conditioning

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.542 position:50% align:center
needed for this type of work.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.336 position:50% align:center
But I'm gonna dedicate
the whole day

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.297 position:50% align:center
to correcting that,
so brace yourselves!

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.257 position:50% align:center
Go and climb that
mountain over there.

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:01.676 position:50% align:center
It'll do wonders to
build up your stamina!

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.554 position:50% align:center
Um, sir? That requires energy,

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:07.140 position:50% align:center
and we haven't had anything
to eat since yesterday.

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:08.933 position:50% align:center
[INSTRUCTOR A] The entire
purpose of this retreat is to

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:10.685 position:50% align:center
teach you how to work
and provide for yourself

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:14.105 position:50% align:center
with the money you make.
Those who don't produce results

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:17.025 position:50% align:center
don't deserve to eat,
now do they?

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:19.903 position:50% align:center
That's how a merit-based
evaluation system works.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.529 position:50% align:center
But if you really
can't hack it,

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:23.365 position:50% align:center
feel free to have my scraps.

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:25.367 position:50% align:center
[GROUP whimpers]

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:29.954 position:50% align:center

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:33.917 position:50% align:center
Uhh... So hungry.

[KINJI gasping]

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:41.216 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
Hm? Don't do it, Ninomiya!

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:43.510 position:50% align:center
Ingesting that plant
will mess with your mind!

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:46.012 position:50% align:center
It's Confusion Grass!

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:49.224 position:50% align:center
Damn it. Can nothing go my way?

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:52.394 position:50% align:center
Side note: when'd you become
so knowledgeable about plants?

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:55.438 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] A result of growing up
in the countryside, I guess.

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:58.483 position:50% align:center
Anyway, let's go earn some real
food by climbing to the top!

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:00.860 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Yeah. Let's.

00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:08.868 position:50% align:center
[GROUP panting]

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:13.748 position:50% align:center
[INSTRUCTOR A] Your muscles are
too weak to support a spine,

00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:16.584 position:50% align:center
so of course you're just
as lacking in discipline.

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:19.838 position:50% align:center
But I'll beat those rotten cores
into shape, don't you worry!

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:24.134 position:50% align:center
In order to train the body,
you have to train the mind,

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:27.512 position:50% align:center
so keep meditating
like that until I say stop!

00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:30.640 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] What skill am I
supposed to learn from this?

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:32.017 position:50% align:center
--[INSTRUCTOR A grunts]
--[KINJI yelps]

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.852 position:50% align:center
[INSTRUCTOR A]
Release your mind!

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:35.145 position:50% align:center
[KINJI gasping]

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:45.864 position:50% align:center
[GRUNTS screaming]

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.327 position:50% align:center
This is the most pathetic
sight I've ever seen.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.621 position:50% align:center
To get you in gear,
I think you worms need some

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:56.624 position:50% align:center
inspirational words from
the founder of Raiza'ha.

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:59.044 position:50% align:center
Read it ten times a day
and engrave in your heart

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:01.963 position:50% align:center
the true example of
how one should live!

00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:03.548 position:50% align:center
[DRONE A]
Thank you...

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:06.176 position:50% align:center
[ELF C] What is this training?
I can't stay here another day!

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.178 position:50% align:center
[GRUNT I]
Calm down. Deep breaths.

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.555 position:50% align:center
Quitting is the only thing that
might calm me down now!

00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:13.683 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] He shouldn't be talking
like that about a path he chose.

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:16.144 position:50% align:center
Despite how many
obstacles they may have.

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:18.313 position:50% align:center
I think it behooves each
of us to be proactive

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.440 position:50% align:center
and see our journeys
through to the end.

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:23.485 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] What a very model-
corporate-grunt thing to say.

00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:25.028 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.822 position:50% align:center
It feels as if my soul's been
cleansed since I arrived.

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:30.909 position:50% align:center
Like I've become the
best version of myself!

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:34.371 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] What's with him?
Was he always like this?

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:35.622 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:38.792 position:50% align:center
something unnatural is
permeating this place.

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:40.794 position:50% align:center
The urge to resist this
so-called "training"

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:44.005 position:50% align:center
has only been expressed
by elf-types.

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:46.424 position:50% align:center
However, the beastman-types
like Wanibe

00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:49.886 position:50% align:center
are all contentedly toeing
the company line.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:52.013 position:50% align:center
Is it a coincidence? No.

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:54.849 position:50% align:center
Because what's most unnatural
is that I, of all people,

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:59.062 position:50% align:center
am happy at the thought of being
another cog in the machine!

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:01.731 position:50% align:center
[DRONE A] Thank you very much,
sir. I will work extremely hard.

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:03.066 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much, sir.

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:05.860 position:50% align:center
Heh. The patented Raiza'ha
brainwashing technique

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:07.278 position:50% align:center
does it again.

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:10.490 position:50% align:center
Slowly but surely, the effects
are starting to show.

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:12.575 position:50% align:center
Even the elves,
who have a higher resistance

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:15.370 position:50% align:center
to magic, are succumbing to it.

00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:17.997 position:50% align:center
For me, there's no
greater feeling than this.

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:19.833 position:50% align:center
Witnessing their
personalities melt

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:23.878 position:50% align:center
like flesh off a bone is
just oh, so satisfying.

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:34.305 position:50% align:center
I'm tired of this food.
It's too dull.

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:35.765 position:50% align:center
[INSTRUCTOR A]
How slow can you be?

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:37.142 position:50% align:center
You all make me sick!

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:39.352 position:50% align:center
If you'd rather be buried
than dig, just ask!

00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:40.603 position:50% align:center
I need water!

00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:41.980 position:50% align:center
[INSTRUCTOR A]
Show me you're worthy of water

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:45.233 position:50% align:center
by filling that hole!
Dig and fill! Dig and fill!

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:47.694 position:50% align:center
When you drink in the
philosophy of infinite work,

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:49.237 position:50% align:center
maybe then I'll let you
do the same with some

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.073 position:50% align:center
high-quality H2O!

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:55.827 position:50% align:center
Isn't this great?
Getting quality vitamin D

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.954 position:50% align:center
sweating our backs
off under the sun?

00:08:58.038 --> 00:08:59.956 position:50% align:center
Refreshing for both
mind and body!

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.918 position:50% align:center
I feel like I'm
becoming a new me!

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:06.379 position:50% align:center
Outdoor orienteering
is the focus today!

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:08.548 position:50% align:center
Work as a group to
develop collaboration skills

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:11.134 position:50% align:center
as well as a sense
of responsibility!

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:15.096 position:50% align:center
Make sure you chant the
corporate slogan as you go!

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.141 position:50% align:center

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.143 position:50% align:center
[ELF B]
Hang in there!

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:21.519 position:50% align:center
Watch your step.

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:24.522 position:50% align:center
It'd make your comrades
really sad if you got hurt.

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:27.525 position:50% align:center
Don't forget, all of us
are in this together!

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:30.195 position:50% align:center
[ELVES]
Come on! Mind over matter!

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:32.989 position:50% align:center
[INSTRUCTOR A] Heh. No one can
withstand the powerful magic

00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:34.532 position:50% align:center
of our black mages.

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:37.869 position:50% align:center
Their emotions are just putty
we can shape to our liking.

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:40.330 position:50% align:center
Greetings! I'm Kinji Ninomiya!

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:43.416 position:50% align:center
And I solemnly swear to devote
myself to the company!

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.168 position:50% align:center
So that my efforts
may contribute

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:46.711 position:50% align:center
to our society's growth!

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:48.088 position:50% align:center
[INSTRUCTOR A]
Who knew a worthless maggot

00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:50.090 position:50% align:center
could make such
an impressive speech?

00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:52.050 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Were you really
impressed by it, sir?

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:55.136 position:50% align:center
Outstanding! Like,
I almost don't believe it!

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.180 position:50% align:center
You were praised
by the instructor!

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:58.932 position:50% align:center
I wish I could see
your face lighting up,

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:01.059 position:50% align:center
but I'm blinded by the tears
that you've stirred!

00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:03.061 position:50% align:center
Ninomiya, I am so proud of you!

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:05.814 position:50% align:center
There are no words for what
I'm feeling right now!

00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:08.316 position:50% align:center
That's the kind of example
we should be following!

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.444 position:50% align:center
Right? The company needs our
backs to push it even higher!

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:12.904 position:50% align:center
C'mon, guys!

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:14.823 position:50% align:center
Let's take everything we've
learned from this training

00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:16.282 position:50% align:center
and really apply ourselves!

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:18.576 position:50% align:center
We'll up our own value
by increasing Raiza'ha's!

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.454 position:50% align:center
[GRUNTS]
Yeah!

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:24.708 position:50% align:center
[GRUNTS laughing, chattering]

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:28.044 position:50% align:center
[BELZA] Congratulations,
gentlemen, on a job well done.

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:30.672 position:50% align:center
Ah, I can feel the
never-ending love you have

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:32.674 position:50% align:center
for our company
from where I sit.

00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:35.010 position:50% align:center
Yes, these admirable
mindsets are perfect

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:37.429 position:50% align:center
for taking on the task
of infinite work!

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:40.306 position:50% align:center
I have never felt so powerful
in my entire life!

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.977 position:50% align:center
I promise to work! Every day
from sunup till sundown!

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:48.398 position:50% align:center
[ELF B] I give my body
and soul to Raiza'ha!

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:50.400 position:50% align:center
[INSTRUCTOR A] Don't let up on
that extra dose of spiritual

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:53.445 position:50% align:center
persuasion you're giving
Lady Belza just yet, fellas.

00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:55.572 position:50% align:center
Can't damage such
prime corporate piglets

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.991 position:50% align:center
right before
they're shipped off.

00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:01.828 position:50% align:center
[ELF B] Sir! Thank you
for your guidance!

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:04.039 position:50% align:center
[INSTRUCTOR A] Before I forget,
since you all managed to pass,

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:05.457 position:50% align:center
you've earned the
right to buy this

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.168 position:50% align:center
specially-made
Lady Belza figurine.

00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:11.129 position:50% align:center
These are a hundred thousand
gold a pop, so who wants one?

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:12.505 position:50% align:center
Me! I do!

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:15.383 position:50% align:center
It's not limited to one
per person, y'know.

00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:16.843 position:50% align:center
[ELF A]
Then I'll have two!

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:19.012 position:50% align:center
[BEASTMAN B] Sir! I'd like
to purchase at least eight!

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.013 position:50% align:center
[BEASTMAN A]
I'll buy one!

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:21.848 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Yeah, me, too!

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:25.602 position:50% align:center
[KINJI laughing]

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.228 position:50% align:center

[GRUNT F laughing]

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:43.036 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE laughs] I wound up
getting three of them!

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:46.081 position:50% align:center
Pretty good deal they offered,
don't you think?

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:47.999 position:50% align:center
I'll show you what I think!

00:11:48.083 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
[screams] You destroyed
three holy idols at once!

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.507 position:50% align:center
I was going to build an altar
at home and everything!

00:11:58.051 --> 00:12:00.261 position:50% align:center
Huh? Was I sleeping?

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:02.055 position:50% align:center
You finally come to your senses?

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:04.724 position:50% align:center
I think so, though I can't
recall very much.

00:12:04.808 --> 00:12:08.269 position:50% align:center
My memory is a bit on
the hazy side right now.

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:11.981 position:50% align:center
So, does that mean our plan
went off without a hitch?

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.484 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'd say operation

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:17.654 position:50% align:center
"Beat Poison With Poison"
worked like a charm.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.072 position:50% align:center
Let's face it,

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.449 position:50% align:center
the brainwashing attempt
couldn't have been more obvious.

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:23.243 position:50% align:center
They were definitely
doing something sneaky

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:26.079 position:50% align:center
to warp our minds
into what they wanted.

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:28.498 position:50% align:center
Luckily, we chanced messing
with our own brains

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50% align:center
before they got their
claws too deep.

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:33.545 position:50% align:center
Random botanical
knowledge for the win.

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center
It was a gamble,
but it paid off in the long run.

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:37.841 position:50% align:center
Kept our minds safe by taking

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:39.759 position:50% align:center
small amounts of
confusion grass.

00:12:39.843 --> 00:12:41.803 position:50% align:center
Can't brainwash a washed brain.

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:44.723 position:50% align:center
That was the theory, at least,
and good thing it was right.

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:47.392 position:50% align:center
If we'd wound up feeling the
effects of the brainwashing

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:50.770 position:50% align:center
and the grass, we would've
been in really bad shape.

00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:52.564 position:50% align:center
Now that I'm looking at
all those guys with my

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:55.400 position:50% align:center
head on straight.
I feel bad for them.

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:56.568 position:50% align:center
They've lost their humanity

00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:58.862 position:50% align:center
and are just tools for
the company now.

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:00.989 position:50% align:center
I know the way I
wanna live my life.

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:02.782 position:50% align:center
But that only applies to me.

00:13:02.866 --> 00:13:05.493 position:50% align:center
It may not be right
for other people.

00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:07.996 position:50% align:center
They came on this retreat
because they wanted to.

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:10.290 position:50% align:center
So maybe a part of
them's happier like this.

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:13.126 position:50% align:center
I, um, highly doubt that.

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:15.962 position:50% align:center
It's not really our
place to doubt them.

00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:18.006 position:50% align:center
Though, that doesn't
mean we can't exact

00:13:18.089 --> 00:13:20.592 position:50% align:center
a little revenge on
their behalf. [chuckles]

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:24.137 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.472 position:50% align:center
[WORKER A]
Forgive the intrusion!

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:27.349 position:50% align:center
The mages are going bonkers!

00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:29.976 position:50% align:center
Someone dosed their food
with confusion grass!

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.770 position:50% align:center
They got their hands
on some explosives

00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:33.104 position:50% align:center
and they're headed this way!

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:34.856 position:50% align:center
[MAGES laughing]

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:45.909 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] So this is
the Group Three office

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:49.079 position:50% align:center
that we'll be working
in from here on out.

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:51.247 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Mm? Hey.

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:54.209 position:50% align:center
[yelps] What in the world
are you doing here?

00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:56.419 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Oh, yeah. This guy's
a "Group Three elite."

00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:58.588 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:03.510 position:50% align:center
If you're gonna hate my guts,
at least hide it.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.055 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
Nice to meet you.

00:14:07.138 --> 00:14:08.431 position:50% align:center
[KINJI, WANIBE]
Hm?

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:11.184 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
I am Kinou Shia. Starting now,

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:13.144 position:50% align:center
I'm going to be acting
as your supervisor

00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:16.606 position:50% align:center
and trusty party leader.
Let's do our best!

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.191 position:50% align:center
[SHIA laughs]

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:20.985 position:50% align:center
The Lady Shia, as in the "Second
Coming of the Hero" Lady Shia

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:22.404 position:50% align:center
who found the
Philosopher's Stone

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:23.738 position:50% align:center
in the Dungeons of Faria?

00:14:23.822 --> 00:14:27.283 position:50% align:center
Oh! I don't know if I deserve
the title "hero."

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:30.120 position:50% align:center
You charmer!

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:31.037 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:35.125 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE groaning]

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:40.338 position:50% align:center
I am so sorry about that.

00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:42.924 position:50% align:center
It was a li'l elbow, but I
guess I should've held back.

00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:44.884 position:50% align:center
I'll still go ahead
and give you the tour.

00:14:44.968 --> 00:14:47.429 position:50% align:center
Mister Wanibe will
just take a rain check.

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:48.805 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Uh, sure.

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:50.932 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] Exploration Division
Groups One through Six

00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:53.351 position:50% align:center
are all based here and use
this big, beautiful building

00:14:53.435 --> 00:14:55.270 position:50% align:center
as their base of operations.

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50% align:center
The way shifts are scheduled
and pay is calculated

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.107 position:50% align:center
depends on the type of work.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.484 position:50% align:center
The mining group, for example,
receives a base salary

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:03.987 position:50% align:center
plus bonuses and
has set work hours.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.031 position:50% align:center
Both salaries and
schedules are fixed

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:08.199 position:50% align:center
for Exploration Groups
Seven and Eight.

00:15:08.283 --> 00:15:11.494 position:50% align:center
However, Group Three's pay
is 100% results-based,

00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:13.455 position:50% align:center
and our hours are flexible.

00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:15.623 position:50% align:center
The deeper you go,
the greater the danger.

00:15:15.707 --> 00:15:19.210 position:50% align:center
And the greater the reward,
assuming you manage to survive.

00:15:19.294 --> 00:15:22.172 position:50% align:center
If you look this way, you'll see
our topnotch Company Mart!

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:23.923 position:50% align:center
Isn't it great?

00:15:24.007 --> 00:15:26.176 position:50% align:center
You can purchase much
higher quality goods here

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:28.303 position:50% align:center
than you'll find anywhere
else in the city!

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:30.597 position:50% align:center
With the right gear, you can
breeze through the dungeons

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.974 position:50% align:center
as if you're taking a stroll
through the park!

00:15:33.058 --> 00:15:35.643 position:50% align:center
To think that they would prepare
such a wonderful store.

00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:38.480 position:50% align:center
And all so we can venture
even further into the dungeons.

00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:40.190 position:50% align:center
Isn't Raiza'ha
Mining Corporation

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:42.317 position:50% align:center
the best thing that ever
happened to you?

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.736 position:50% align:center
I mean, what could be better?

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:46.905 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Lots of stuff.

00:15:46.988 --> 00:15:50.116 position:50% align:center
You realize what this is, right?
We dig up demonite for them,

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.453 position:50% align:center
then they use it to make
equipment they want us to buy.

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:55.497 position:50% align:center
So if we can't meet
the quota they set,

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.249 position:50% align:center
we have to buy stuff here
to make the job easier.

00:15:58.333 --> 00:16:00.043 position:50% align:center
Never mind how we're
walking the line

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:01.294 position:50% align:center
between life and death.

00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:02.712 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:05.674 position:50% align:center
Making workers buy company
items using their own pay.

00:16:05.757 --> 00:16:09.511 position:50% align:center
Damn. Like, how much more
rotten can they possibly get?

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:11.680 position:50% align:center
How dare you say such
blasphemous words

00:16:11.763 --> 00:16:13.765 position:50% align:center
in these halls! You should
feel honored to work for

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:15.266 position:50% align:center
such a respectable business!

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.894 position:50% align:center
So where'd this negativity
and sarcasm come from?

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:18.978 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:19.062 --> 00:16:20.772 position:50% align:center
How can you be anything
but optimistic

00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:22.482 position:50% align:center
when talking about our job?

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:24.776 position:50% align:center
Once you vanquish the obstacles
standing in your way,

00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:27.779 position:50% align:center
you're rewarded with everyone's
smiles on the other side!

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:30.240 position:50% align:center
What life could be more
fulfilling than that?

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:32.659 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Spoken like a
true corporate grunt.

00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:35.078 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I'm not a
superhuman like you.

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:38.248 position:50% align:center
I'd rather my workplace not
exploit me until the day I die.

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:41.376 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
Oh, is death your concern?

00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:43.461 position:50% align:center
Well, risking your life is easy.

00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:45.588 position:50% align:center
Once you get used to it,
that is.

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:48.174 position:50% align:center
[KINJI grunts]

00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:50.218 position:50% align:center
Hey! What're you doing?

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:51.594 position:50% align:center
Let's go see
what you're made of.

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:54.264 position:50% align:center
Put me down right now!
I mean it!

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:56.766 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.768 position:50% align:center
What is this place?

00:16:58.852 --> 00:17:00.145 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
What do you mean, "what"?

00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:02.355 position:50% align:center
This is the third floor
of the dungeon, silly.

00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:05.442 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] It's unlike anything
I've ever seen, that's for sure.

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:06.818 position:50% align:center
Well, the more you know.

00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:09.195 position:50% align:center
The structure changes
quite drastically from here.

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:11.948 position:50% align:center
But wait. Haven't you been
to the third floor before?

00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:13.450 position:50% align:center
I... uh...

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:17.662 position:50% align:center
I have, but it was through
what some may call a "shortcut."

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:20.707 position:50% align:center
Good! I was hoping a
monster would show up!

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.417 position:50% align:center
It's a Hecatoncheire.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.294 position:50% align:center
As far as creatures
go on this floor,

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:27.630 position:50% align:center
these are around the middle
rank, so par for the course!

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:30.508 position:50% align:center
Ooh, I can see an accessory
stuck between its fangs!

00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:32.427 position:50% align:center
I bet it ate someone recently!

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:33.845 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:37.057 position:50% align:center
Okay, Mister Ninomiya. Ready?
Show me what you've got!

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.933 position:50% align:center
What? You want me to fight?

00:17:39.017 --> 00:17:40.602 position:50% align:center
That's kinda the
whole point here.

00:17:40.685 --> 00:17:42.437 position:50% align:center
How else am I supposed
to figure out how strong

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.191 position:50% align:center
you are and assess
all your abilities?

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.905 position:50% align:center
[KINJI gasps, groans]

00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:53.239 position:50% align:center
Hi, sweetheart.

00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:54.657 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to be his foe,

00:17:54.741 --> 00:17:58.745 position:50% align:center
but since you took the
initiative and came to me...

00:17:58.828 --> 00:18:03.708 position:50% align:center
[SHIA laughs]
Wow, you're a lively one!

00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:05.627 position:50% align:center
Shame. If you're gonna
stand in my way,

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.087 position:50% align:center
then we can't be friends.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.172 position:50% align:center
[ANT A chattering]

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:12.384 position:50% align:center
Hey! Ant A, how's it hanging?

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.721 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
Divine Execution.

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:22.102 position:50% align:center
Super Hero Slice!

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:30.485 position:50% align:center
Kinou Shia.

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center
Small fry.

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:33.196 position:50% align:center
Didn't even make me
break a sweat,

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:35.323 position:50% align:center
but I guess a
warm-up's always nice.

00:18:35.407 --> 00:18:36.741 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
She's gonna be more trouble

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:39.619 position:50% align:center
than I originally thought.

00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:42.956 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] Uh, Mister Ninomiya?
What are you doing up there?

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:45.000 position:50% align:center
I brought you here
to fight, not climb.

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:46.918 position:50% align:center
Though I will note that skill.

00:18:47.002 --> 00:18:50.463 position:50% align:center
What the....?
That's a dungeon ant.

00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:52.048 position:50% align:center
[KINJI grunts]

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:54.801 position:50% align:center
What are you waiting for?
Hurry up and slay it.

00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:56.678 position:50% align:center
Funny story,
but to sum it up,

00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center
this guy actually lost the will
to fight out of fear of me.

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:02.308 position:50% align:center
Killing him just feels wrong.

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:05.687 position:50% align:center
You're not killing.
That term isn't accurate.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.522 position:50% align:center
You're exterminating it.

00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:10.859 position:50% align:center
And if it has no will to fight,
that makes the job a cinch.

00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:13.278 position:50% align:center
[ANT A whimpers]

00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:15.113 position:50% align:center
It seems attached to you.

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:16.906 position:50% align:center
Huh? Really?

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.450 position:50% align:center
Almost like it's your friend.

00:19:18.533 --> 00:19:20.160 position:50% align:center
And you said some
pretty terrible things

00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:22.954 position:50% align:center
about the company earlier.

00:19:23.038 --> 00:19:24.664 position:50% align:center
If my instincts are correct,

00:19:24.748 --> 00:19:26.833 position:50% align:center
you're really a monster
disguised as a man!

00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:28.084 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Huh?

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:29.669 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
Say your prayers, you fraud!

00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:33.173 position:50% align:center
Wait, whoa! Does she not have
brains to go with that brawn?

00:19:33.256 --> 00:19:34.924 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:38.094 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Rim! It's chow time!

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:43.141 position:50% align:center
How many friends
do you have down here?

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:45.894 position:50% align:center
And what is this power?

00:19:45.977 --> 00:19:47.062 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
Hungry.

00:19:47.145 --> 00:19:49.105 position:50% align:center
You've, uh, hit a bit
of a growth spurt

00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:51.149 position:50% align:center
while I was off on
Pig Pen Isle, huh?

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:54.486 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
Perish, you deceptive monster!

00:19:56.029 --> 00:20:00.075 position:50% align:center
[RIM] Ouchie. Guess it's
time to get serious.

00:20:11.002 --> 00:20:12.629 position:50% align:center
[SHIA groans]

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:20.887 position:50% align:center
[RIM] You pissed me off.
Don't do it again.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.014 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
What's up with you?

00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:25.642 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] I would appreciate
being untied, please!

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:27.310 position:50% align:center
Do you even care
that you're violating

00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:28.978 position:50% align:center
company policy right now?

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:31.189 position:50% align:center
Wow, you really managed
to capture the puppet

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:32.732 position:50% align:center
they mistake for a hero!

00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:35.735 position:50% align:center
Seeing her disgraced like
I was brings me such joy!

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:37.946 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] So you are in
cahoots with monsters!

00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:40.407 position:50% align:center
Which is an unforgivable
act of treason.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.535 position:50% align:center
Thanks for waiting!
Sorry I'm late!

00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:44.994 position:50% align:center
Is this real life?

00:20:45.078 --> 00:20:46.788 position:50% align:center
Yo. Glad you made it, Wanibe.

00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:48.164 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
I don't want any part of this.

00:20:48.248 --> 00:20:49.374 position:50% align:center
Since you're here, I take it

00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:50.792 position:50% align:center
you're working
with this traitor!

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:52.961 position:50% align:center
Eh? Please explain.

00:20:53.044 --> 00:20:55.547 position:50% align:center
Because, as per usual,
I'm very confused.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.549 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] I feel like it's
self-explanatory.

00:20:57.632 --> 00:20:59.384 position:50% align:center
She found out we're
teaming up with monsters

00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:00.635 position:50% align:center
and now she's our prisoner.

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:04.014 position:50% align:center
Ah! Miss Shia, of all
the people in the world?

00:21:04.097 --> 00:21:05.181 position:50% align:center
That's gotta be
the worst hostage

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:06.683 position:50% align:center
you could've taken!

00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:09.269 position:50% align:center
I'm reporting this as soon as
I get free, mark my words.

00:21:09.352 --> 00:21:10.395 position:50% align:center
And for what it's worth,

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:12.522 position:50% align:center
I, personally, will
never forgive you!

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:15.066 position:50% align:center
Aw, geez.
This is beyond bad news.

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:16.776 position:50% align:center
What's gonna happen to us
if the company

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.653 position:50% align:center
finds out what we're
doing down here?

00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:23.158 position:50% align:center
Not to worry, my reptilian
friend. Luckily, I have a plan.

00:21:23.241 --> 00:21:25.660 position:50% align:center
Did you bring the camera,
like I asked you?

00:21:25.744 --> 00:21:28.955 position:50% align:center
Wait. Um. What are you scheming?

00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:32.792 position:50% align:center
[KINJI, ANT QUEEN laughing]

00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:33.960 position:50% align:center
Man! How great is this?

00:21:34.044 --> 00:21:35.462 position:50% align:center
Indeed!

00:21:35.545 --> 00:21:37.088 position:50% align:center
So, unless you want the world
to see their favorite hero

00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:38.965 position:50% align:center
getting chummy
with her monster pals,

00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:41.760 position:50% align:center
keep your lips zipped
'bout everything you saw!

00:21:41.843 --> 00:21:43.511 position:50% align:center
[SHIA gasps]
You wouldn't dare!

00:21:43.595 --> 00:21:45.096 position:50% align:center
Please say it ain't so.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.765 position:50% align:center
The only reason you
had me bring the camera

00:21:46.848 --> 00:21:49.017 position:50% align:center
was so that you could
blackmail Miss Shia?

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.727 position:50% align:center
You are just downright evil!

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.355 position:50% align:center
And I conquer all evil
that crosses my path!

00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:54.647 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Since you're
officially one of us,

00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:56.983 position:50% align:center
you really shouldn't
threaten your colleagues.

00:21:57.067 --> 00:21:59.402 position:50% align:center
Now be sure to put that
stellar work ethic of yours

00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:02.197 position:50% align:center
to good use for the Dungeon
Black Company, all right?

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.116 position:50% align:center
What the heck is a
Dungeon Black Company?

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.745 position:50% align:center
If it's anything like it sounds,
there's no doubt it's dreadful!

00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:13.833 position:50% align:center
[KINJI laughing]
