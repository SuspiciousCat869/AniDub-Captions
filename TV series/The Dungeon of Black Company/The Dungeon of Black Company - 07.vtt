00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:12.387 position:50% align:center
[DEMON LORD]
Ninomiya.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.223 position:50% align:center
I have a favor
I'd like to request.

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:20.895 position:50% align:center
It's a trivial little thing.
I want you to save this world.

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:21.938 position:50% align:center
What?

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.565 position:50% align:center
Are you really
the Demon Lord?

00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:26.026 position:50% align:center
'Cause you look an
awful lot like Rim!

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.278 position:50% align:center
Oh, I should have congratulated
you on making it

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:31.990 position:50% align:center
to my castle first!
But yes, I am the Demon Lord.

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:34.868 position:50% align:center
You stand before the one who
rules the millions of monsters

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:38.371 position:50% align:center
inhabiting this barren land
we're forced to call home.

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:40.749 position:50% align:center
Behold my overwhelming majesty.

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:44.336 position:50% align:center
And may it be eternally
engraved into your souls.

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:46.254 position:50% align:center
[DEMON LORD gasping]

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:48.548 position:50% align:center
[DEMON LORD yelps]

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:55.013 position:50% align:center
[BOTH screaming]

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:31.526 position:50% align:center
Okay! She was dead
when we got here!

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:32.694 position:50% align:center
Works for me!

00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:34.070 position:50% align:center
[DEMON LORD]
Come on now.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.990 position:50% align:center
Isn't that a little
too heartless?

00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:40.201 position:50% align:center
[DEMON LORD sighs]
You'll have excuse me.

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:42.829 position:50% align:center
Ever since my dear sister
literally ripped my head off

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:44.789 position:50% align:center
it just won't stay in
place like it used to.

00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:47.667 position:50% align:center
Jeez! I mean, what're
you supposed to be?

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:50.754 position:50% align:center
I'm not "supposed" to be
anything, I'm the Demon Lord.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.088 position:50% align:center
What you haven't told us is why

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:54.341 position:50% align:center
you look so much like
our companion, Rim!

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:55.884 position:50% align:center
Siblings among humans tend

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:58.553 position:50% align:center
to bear similarities in
appearance, do they not?

00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:01.181 position:50% align:center
It's natural I
resemble my sister.

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:02.307 position:50% align:center
Sister?

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.808 position:50% align:center
Don't look at me.

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:08.355 position:50% align:center
All right. Does seeing this
help jog your memory at all?

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:09.647 position:50% align:center
[RANGA, KINJI gasp]

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:12.108 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.069 position:50% align:center
[crash]

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:22.410 position:50% align:center
Impressive, as always.

00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:27.248 position:50% align:center
Hey, that did help!
You're the Majin!

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:30.001 position:50% align:center
[DEMON LORD laughs]
Took you long enough.

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:32.087 position:50% align:center
Sorry I had to shock
it into your brain.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.672 position:50% align:center
Though, this "Majin"
title is something

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:36.466 position:50% align:center
your kind invented, and
I've never been fond of it.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.218 position:50% align:center
I was the Guardian
of that dungeon.

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:39.636 position:50% align:center
In fact, my kind watches over

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.805 position:50% align:center
the whole planet,
in a manner of speaking.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:44.057 position:50% align:center
Is that true?

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.850 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
No idea.

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:48.728 position:50% align:center
[DEMON LORD] Several eons ago,
an advanced society

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:51.815 position:50% align:center
at the peak of splendor
roamed this world.

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:53.858 position:50% align:center
They were called the
Calonians and are credited

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:55.819 position:50% align:center
as the creators of "magic."

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.445 position:50% align:center
They controlled
not only the planet,

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:00.448 position:50% align:center
but the very fabric
of time and space.

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:03.326 position:50% align:center
And you got to experience
that power firsthand.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.078 position:50% align:center
They're the ones responsible
for sending you

00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:08.415 position:50% align:center
to this world, as well
as its future, Ninomiya.

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.458 position:50% align:center
Wait, really?

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:12.210 position:50% align:center
[DEMON LORD] One of the
precious things we Guardians

00:04:12.293 --> 00:04:13.503 position:50% align:center
are tasked with maintaining

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:16.381 position:50% align:center
is the circulation
of magic power.

00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:18.258 position:50% align:center
Another is the dungeons.

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:19.926 position:50% align:center
We were each assigned
to a specific one

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.803 position:50% align:center
to protect it from
vandals and thieves.

00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:23.096 position:50% align:center
Plenty of priceless
treasure down

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:24.305 position:50% align:center
in those caves greedy humans

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.391 position:50% align:center
would love to get
their hands on.

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:28.101 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Huh? But Rim...

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:29.602 position:50% align:center
[DEMON LORD]
Oh, I know.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:32.731 position:50% align:center
The Detmolt dungeon had a huge
flaw, emphasis on "huge."

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:35.233 position:50% align:center
Though its Guardian was
incredible in many ways--

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:36.818 position:50% align:center
it was a total idiot.

00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:38.069 position:50% align:center
What did you say?

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:39.571 position:50% align:center
[RANGA, KINJI grunt]

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:41.156 position:50% align:center
[DEMON LORD] The circulation
of magic within the dungeon

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.283 position:50% align:center
was cut off because
my foolish sister forgot

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.076 position:50% align:center
all about her duties
and, instead,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.163 position:50% align:center
chose to spend her days
lollygagging on the surface.

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:50.081 position:50% align:center
The dungeon birthed me
as a replacement,

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:52.167 position:50% align:center
and that's how we came
to our current juncture.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50% align:center
Tch. Enough with these
pointless particulars.

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:58.423 position:50% align:center
'Cause I only have one
question I want you to answer!

00:04:58.506 --> 00:04:59.466 position:50% align:center
Is it within your power

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:02.886 position:50% align:center
to transport me back
to Japan or not?

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center
The answer is, "Yes."

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:06.931 position:50% align:center
But we're missing a
few more key players

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:09.768 position:50% align:center
before we start that discussion.

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:12.228 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Could you stop
making excuses and just--

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.064 position:50% align:center
They're here.

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:23.281 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
What now?

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:24.908 position:50% align:center
[DEMON LORD]
Raiza'ha, that's what.

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.451 position:50% align:center
How can that be when
their corporation

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:27.994 position:50% align:center
went out of business?

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:31.373 position:50% align:center
Oh, you sweet, summer child.
All they did was go into hiding.

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:32.916 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
What do you mean?

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:36.002 position:50% align:center
It happened shortly after
you were sent to this time.

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:37.754 position:50% align:center
Raiza'ha breached
the Calonian ruins

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:39.881 position:50% align:center
and reverse engineered
the ancient technology

00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:42.676 position:50% align:center
they discovered there.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.219 position:50% align:center
They made corporate
drone culture

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:46.763 position:50% align:center
the root of society and
dominated everything,

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.682 position:50% align:center
which was fine by me.

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:50.266 position:50% align:center
If only that were it.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.060 position:50% align:center
You see, society
can do whatever,

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:53.353 position:50% align:center
not so much the world.

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:54.688 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
'Cause of the magic?

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.231 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.441 position:50% align:center
They consumed the wellspring
of power at ridiculous speed,

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:01.528 position:50% align:center
and that imbalance was what
made the world decay.

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:04.614 position:50% align:center
The fate of humanity is of
little concern to us Guardians.

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:05.949 position:50% align:center
What we care about is keeping

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.909 position:50% align:center
the magic flow of
the planet consistent,

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:10.704 position:50% align:center
which is why this presented
quite the problem.

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:13.039 position:50% align:center
I had no choice but to
go to the surface level

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:15.834 position:50% align:center
and unleash an assault
on Raiza'ha.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.253 position:50% align:center
Although I was able to force
them to retreat into the rift

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:20.422 position:50% align:center
between dimensions,

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:23.675 position:50% align:center
seems they're through
playing hide-and-seek.

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:32.183 position:50% align:center
[KINJI, RANGA grunt]

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:36.021 position:50% align:center
Very soon, the final battle
for this world will be upon us.

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:39.107 position:50% align:center
If they win, this planet will
become a complete dystopia,

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.152 position:50% align:center
one void of any life whatsoever.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.446 position:50% align:center
After all, their goal
is nothing less than

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:48.074 position:50% align:center
to rule a commercial nation
with mechanized beings.

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:50.785 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] So then that robot
from the other day...

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.328 position:50% align:center
You guessed it.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:55.290 position:50% align:center
One of their forward scouts used
to brainwash the opposition.

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:57.751 position:50% align:center
A custom corporate soldier.

00:06:57.834 --> 00:06:59.627 position:50% align:center
I never wanted this war.

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:02.756 position:50% align:center
Not back then and
definitely not now.

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:08.720 position:50% align:center
That said, I don't
intend to lose.

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:12.223 position:50% align:center
But I realize Raiza'ha is
a force to be reckoned with

00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:16.186 position:50% align:center
as long as they wield
the power of the ancients.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.605 position:50% align:center
They can revive themselves
almost infinitely

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:20.357 position:50% align:center
and come back
stronger each time,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.025 position:50% align:center
while simultaneously shaving off

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.652 position:50% align:center
the life of the planet
with every attack.

00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:26.613 position:50% align:center
Our future looks
fairly dim at the moment.

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:29.574 position:50% align:center
But that's why I
brought you here.

00:07:29.657 --> 00:07:33.495 position:50% align:center
Please, travel back in time.
Stop Raiza'ha from committing

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:37.123 position:50% align:center
these evil deeds I've spoken of.
I want you to alter history

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:40.210 position:50% align:center
and prevent this war
from ever happening.

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:43.672 position:50% align:center
Tch. For a Demon Lord,
you sure are a drama queen.

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:46.341 position:50% align:center
This wasn't a meeting,
it was story time.

00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:49.594 position:50% align:center
Of all people,
why would you choose me?

00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:51.346 position:50% align:center
"Why," you ask?

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:53.223 position:50% align:center
Because you're
incredibly resilient

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:56.142 position:50% align:center
and never know when to give up.

00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:59.187 position:50% align:center
I understand how
unreasonable this sounds.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.356 position:50% align:center
So, it's your call.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.652 position:50% align:center
[DEMON LORD] The red door
you see on your right

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:09.614 position:50% align:center
leads to a dimensional portal
that will return you to Japan.

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:12.033 position:50% align:center
The blue door on your left
leads to a time portal

00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:14.202 position:50% align:center
that takes you back to the past.

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:15.954 position:50% align:center
You may now walk
through whichever door

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:17.664 position:50% align:center
strikes your fancy.

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:19.541 position:50% align:center
My, that's quite
generous of you.

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:22.502 position:50% align:center
So, which door are you
going to pick, Ninomiya?

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:25.213 position:50% align:center
Almost immediately after
getting to this world,

00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:28.883 position:50% align:center
I was practically forced to
work for that lousy company.

00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:31.136 position:50% align:center
My bosses were absolute trash,

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:34.222 position:50% align:center
I was humiliated on the daily,
and just when I thought

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:36.016 position:50% align:center
I finally found
the key to success,

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:39.477 position:50% align:center
I got shunted into some
time travel escapade!

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:42.105 position:50% align:center
Two lives I worked to
build up were ripped away.

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:43.940 position:50% align:center
I had to start
from scratch again.

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:46.860 position:50% align:center
And the big, bright red cherry
on top of everything,

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:49.154 position:50% align:center
is those losers from
Raiza'ha are about

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:51.698 position:50% align:center
to achieve world domination.

00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:54.576 position:50% align:center
[RANGA gasping]

00:08:56.202 --> 00:09:02.542 position:50% align:center
The absurdity of it all
makes my head spin. So, yeah.

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:05.253 position:50% align:center
I'd think my choice is obvious.

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:08.340 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] You should really
take a break, Miss Shia!

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:10.967 position:50% align:center
You're going to faint if you
keep working non-stop!

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:12.302 position:50% align:center
I haven't met my quota yet,

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.888 position:50% align:center
so please keep comments
like that to yourself.

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.806 position:50% align:center
No one listens to
a slacker's voice,

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.393 position:50% align:center
and I want people
to value what I say.

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:23.480 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] Being forced to
take on an impossible quota.

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:25.690 position:50% align:center
We've even lost
the right to quit.

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:28.568 position:50% align:center
And if we're unable to work,
we're quickly replaced.

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:32.364 position:50% align:center
They don't view us as employees.
They view us as resources.

00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:37.160 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
Hm? Uh! Miss Shia!

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:42.374 position:50% align:center
[DRAGON A groans]

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:45.710 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] My motivation to live
is generally quite petty.

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:47.837 position:50% align:center
For starters, I can't
stand seeing those

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:50.840 position:50% align:center
who look down on me
get their way.

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:53.218 position:50% align:center
So, you can imagine
how pissed I was

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:55.178 position:50% align:center
when I found out the
people who wronged me

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:59.182 position:50% align:center
ruled the world, and yet...
I keep those petty grudges

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:03.103 position:50% align:center
close to my heart and use them
to strengthen my resolve.

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:06.815 position:50% align:center
That's why I always retaliate!

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:09.651 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Hey! Did ya miss me?

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:12.779 position:50% align:center
He's actually here!

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:13.947 position:50% align:center
[KINJI grunts]

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.325 position:50% align:center
[WORKERS cheer]

00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:20.036 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
Whoa. This is really something.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.288 position:50% align:center
What are these guys
so riled up for?

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:24.332 position:50% align:center
Well, a lot's changed
since you've been gone,

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:25.959 position:50% align:center
like how everyone
is super depressed,

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:28.628 position:50% align:center
even the Exploration Division's
morale has been down.

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:30.630 position:50% align:center
They're excited because you
were missing for a month

00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:32.257 position:50% align:center
and now suddenly, you're back.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.218 position:50% align:center
Good news like that serves
as a nice distraction.

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.512 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Hm...

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:39.556 position:50% align:center
[SECRETARY A]
Mister Kinji Ninomiya.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:40.807 position:50% align:center
[KINJI grunts]

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.643 position:50% align:center
Lady Belza has summoned you.

00:10:43.727 --> 00:10:46.771 position:50% align:center
Heh. That was faster
than I thought.

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:51.901 position:50% align:center
Mister Ninomiya. Welcome.

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:53.695 position:50% align:center
Due to your unannounced absence,

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:56.406 position:50% align:center
you are obliged to pay a
fine for breach of contract

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:59.242 position:50% align:center
plus compensation for damages
to company goods,

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:01.786 position:50% align:center
which amounts to
ten million gold.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.330 position:50% align:center
And that's not including
the fees for the search party

00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:07.417 position:50% align:center
we sent out to try
and retrieve you.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.586 position:50% align:center
[FAU]
Hey, hey! Looks like the rumors

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.297 position:50% align:center
about the scumbag
being back were true!

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.049 position:50% align:center
Better get on those
payments straightaway,

00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center
you know, before
the interest piles up!

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:22.390 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Right. You might
have scared the old me,

00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:24.934 position:50% align:center
but you have no idea who
you're dealing with now.

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:26.186 position:50% align:center
[FAU]
What?

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:28.271 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] I'm a new man,
with new capabilities.

00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:29.814 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:31.483 position:50% align:center
[BELZA] Before you leave,
I should inform you

00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:34.611 position:50% align:center
that your dormitory
was reassigned.

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.571 position:50% align:center
There was no point
in keeping a room open

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:39.115 position:50% align:center
for an employee who might
be dead, after all.

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:41.451 position:50% align:center
Surely you understand.

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:43.745 position:50% align:center
[KINJI laughs]

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:49.376 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Someone lost
a few screws.

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:52.379 position:50% align:center
Which makes him unstable.
Perhaps we should do something

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:55.256 position:50% align:center
before he's completely
out of control.

00:11:56.091 --> 00:11:57.258 position:50% align:center
[doorbell rings]

00:11:57.342 --> 00:12:00.303 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
Coming! Who is it?

00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:02.138 position:50% align:center
Surprise, Shia!

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:04.349 position:50% align:center
Care if we make ourselves
at home? Great!

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:05.809 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Excuse me!

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:07.310 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
My tummy is grumbly.

00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:09.229 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] Please pardon
our intrusion, Miss Shia.

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:10.313 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
Wait! You better have

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:12.816 position:50% align:center
a good explanation
for barging here!

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:17.696 position:50% align:center
They took away my dorm,
so I figured I'd live with you.

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:22.784 position:50% align:center
[SHIA gasping, screaming]

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:25.829 position:50% align:center
Let's just get one thing clear!

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:28.957 position:50% align:center
This is a temporary arrangement
until you find your own place!

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.875 position:50% align:center
I also hope you realize
I'm only doing this

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:32.043 position:50% align:center
because it would reflect poorly

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:34.045 position:50% align:center
on my "Hero" status
if I ignored someone

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:35.964 position:50% align:center
who reached out to me
in a time of need!

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:37.716 position:50% align:center
Sure, whatever you say.

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:39.426 position:50% align:center
Now could you come
down off your high horse

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:40.677 position:50% align:center
long enough to show your guests

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.721 position:50% align:center
some manners and
brew us a pot of coffee?

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.222 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] You're the last
person on the planet...

00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:46.474 position:50% align:center
No sugar, though.
I'll take it black like my soul.

00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50% align:center
Are you even listening to me?

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:50.562 position:50% align:center
Aw, there's no need
to get so upset.

00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:53.857 position:50% align:center
Honest! Oh, here's an idea.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.567 position:50% align:center
Please accept this modest gift.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.862 position:50% align:center
For me? Wow!
Thank you so much.

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:01.823 position:50% align:center
Though, I'm not sure
who you are.

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:03.908 position:50% align:center
How do you know Mister Ninomiya?

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:06.453 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] Yeah, I'm curious
about that, too.

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:08.997 position:50% align:center
Well, uh... You see.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.331 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right.

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:12.083 position:50% align:center
I still haven't gotten
you guys up to speed

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:13.376 position:50% align:center
on the brilliant path of glory

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.253 position:50% align:center
I've been marching
so relentlessly.

00:13:15.337 --> 00:13:17.255 position:50% align:center
Gather round, everyone!

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:21.468 position:50% align:center
This tale is called
"Back to the Ninomiya!"

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:26.765 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
No. Our civilization is doomed?

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:28.933 position:50% align:center
Wish I could go back
in time and not listen.

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:30.101 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Since you're swallowing

00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:31.728 position:50% align:center
everything I'm feeding
you fairly easily,

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:34.064 position:50% align:center
watch out for fraud
and stuff, okay?

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
So, this girl's from the future?

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:38.276 position:50% align:center
Please, lizard man,
call me Ranga!

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.861 position:50% align:center
Well, I, for one, don't believe

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:41.905 position:50% align:center
any of the nonsense
you just spouted off.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:45.325 position:50% align:center
Hey! I haven't gotten
to the best part yet!

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:47.452 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
Uh, hold that thought.

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:51.373 position:50% align:center
Yes? Ah! I am so sorry,
I lost track of time!

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:53.166 position:50% align:center
Sit tight and
I'll be right there!

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:55.001 position:50% align:center
I totally forgot
tonight's event!

00:13:55.085 --> 00:13:56.795 position:50% align:center
And I was in charge of it!

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:58.296 position:50% align:center
Mind filling me in?

00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.798 position:50% align:center
There's a kickoff party tonight.

00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:02.634 position:50% align:center
The Exploration and Gathering
divisions are hosting it.

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:03.885 position:50% align:center
Free food?

00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:05.053 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:06.805 position:50% align:center
Free food. At the party.
Will it be there?

00:14:06.888 --> 00:14:08.932 position:50% align:center
Though it's rare for
Raiza'ha to treat us,

00:14:09.015 --> 00:14:11.518 position:50% align:center
there actually is. I wonder
if it's a way to get us

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:14.020 position:50% align:center
amped up for a big job
they have planned.

00:14:14.104 --> 00:14:17.315 position:50% align:center
You have five seconds to
get in party mode, Rim.

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:21.236 position:50% align:center
Can't pass up a chance
to score some free grub.

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:23.154 position:50% align:center
Rim's ready to go!

00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:25.323 position:50% align:center
Now wait just a minute,
Mister Ninomiya!

00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:27.325 position:50% align:center
Are you honestly tagging along?

00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:29.411 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Is that a problem?

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:31.955 position:50% align:center
Sometimes absence makes
the heart grow fonder

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:33.998 position:50% align:center
and other times it has
the opposite effect.

00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:36.251 position:50% align:center
What I'm trying to say is...

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:38.753 position:50% align:center
People hate your guts
with a fiery passion.

00:14:38.837 --> 00:14:40.797 position:50% align:center
And I'm fully aware! I don't get

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.133 position:50% align:center
my kicks fraternizing
with the sheeple, pal!

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:44.342 position:50% align:center
Under normal circumstances,

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:46.177 position:50% align:center
I would've never
wanted to join you!

00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:48.346 position:50% align:center
Then why are you joining us?

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.889 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] 'Cause there's
a bunch of free food

00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:51.641 position:50% align:center
and booze to be had!

00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:53.643 position:50% align:center
The secret ingredient
that makes everything

00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:55.812 position:50% align:center
taste better is giving
it out for free!

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:58.398 position:50% align:center
[GRUNTS chattering]

00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:00.191 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
Everyone? Hold up your glasses

00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:02.318 position:50% align:center
and please, join me in a toast!

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:05.905 position:50% align:center
That's my food, Rim! Let go!

00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:07.991 position:50% align:center
Why you--! Wanibe!

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:09.534 position:50% align:center
Be a bro and hand me
that thing over there!

00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:12.078 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
Don't drag me into this!

00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:17.876 position:50% align:center
Back to what I was saying.
Cheers, guys!

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:19.502 position:50% align:center
[GRUNTS]
Cheers!

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:22.130 position:50% align:center
[GRUNT D] Come on, rookie!
Don't be a slug!

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:23.298 position:50% align:center
Show us what
you've got and

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:25.050 position:50% align:center
chug, chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug,

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:26.926 position:50% align:center
chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug,

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.970 position:50% align:center
chug, chug!

00:15:29.054 --> 00:15:31.598 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I don't think
I can chug anymore.

00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:34.768 position:50% align:center
You're either buzzed or a
buzzkill, so which are you?

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:38.146 position:50% align:center
Stop ruining the party
and drink, man!

00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:41.149 position:50% align:center
Don't think I haven't noticed
you slacking off, 'cause I have.

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:42.817 position:50% align:center
That's news to me, sir.

00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:44.486 position:50% align:center
You and the other
good-for-nothings

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:48.490 position:50% align:center
need to find your
workers' spirit, that's all!

00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:51.534 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Wanna know what
I just thought of?

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:55.163 position:50% align:center
You youngins are always saying,
"Oh I don't wanna get yelled at.

00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:57.123 position:50% align:center
I don't have a place to sleep!"

00:15:57.207 --> 00:15:58.917 position:50% align:center
But that's what everybody
has to go through

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.418 position:50% align:center
if they're working
like they should be!

00:16:00.502 --> 00:16:01.753 position:50% align:center
Know what I mean? Eh?

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:03.129 position:50% align:center
Uhh...

00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:05.006 position:50% align:center
If you were weak
back in my day,

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.800 position:50% align:center
you didn't make the cut...

00:16:06.883 --> 00:16:08.927 position:50% align:center
Another drunken anecdote
for the books.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.762 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE chuckles nervously]

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:14.391 position:50% align:center
Wow! Mister Director,
you're so cool!

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.101 position:50% align:center
I'm just a man with
refined tastes,

00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:17.102 position:50% align:center
which is why I can tell

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:19.104 position:50% align:center
this wine hasn't
been aged enough.

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:20.897 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
I would've never guessed!

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.149 position:50% align:center
If you ain't got history,
you ain't got nothin'!

00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:24.401 position:50% align:center
Very true!

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:25.777 position:50% align:center
[DIRECTOR A]
For a battle-hardened veteran

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.737 position:50% align:center
such as myself,
there needs to be more depth

00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:30.156 position:50% align:center
if it's gonna take up my
valuable time, you know?

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.909 position:50% align:center
Jeez, you must be
incredibly strong!

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:35.829 position:50% align:center
Never seen her before.
Is she even an employee?

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:37.330 position:50% align:center
I honestly don't know.

00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:40.542 position:50% align:center
But she's friggin' adorable,
so who cares?

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:43.294 position:50% align:center
That idiot needs to learn
how to pull her punches.

00:16:43.378 --> 00:16:45.005 position:50% align:center
Been a hot minute, Ninomiya.

00:16:45.088 --> 00:16:47.590 position:50% align:center
Though I see you still
can't read the room.

00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:50.385 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] No. I'll glance at a
room if it's worth reading.

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:52.721 position:50% align:center
You never change
even a little, do you?

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:55.682 position:50% align:center
We're having this
conversation because...?

00:16:55.765 --> 00:16:57.517 position:50% align:center
Hey! After everything
we went through,

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.935 position:50% align:center
you forgot who I am?

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:01.688 position:50% align:center
I'm the elite, Krutz,
from the ant monster incident?

00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:05.275 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yeah. Krutz. I remember now.

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:08.778 position:50% align:center
I can't decide if your luck
is insanely good or bad.

00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:10.655 position:50% align:center
Everybody down to the
search party members

00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:12.282 position:50% align:center
were convinced you died.

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:14.701 position:50% align:center
Not that anyone would have
missed you, of course.

00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:16.411 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Well, the feeling's mutual.

00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:19.122 position:50% align:center
That said, you do
give us all courage.

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:20.582 position:50% align:center
I think a lot of
people were relieved

00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:22.917 position:50% align:center
to hear that you
made it back alive.

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:24.753 position:50% align:center
And what does that mean?

00:17:24.836 --> 00:17:26.629 position:50% align:center
It means exactly
what it sounds like.

00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:28.506 position:50% align:center
'Scuse me, but...

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.717 position:50% align:center
You should keep an
eye on your friend.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.178 position:50% align:center
It's like throwing food
in a bottomless pit.

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:35.347 position:50% align:center
You said the company's
buying tonight, yeah?

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.057 position:50% align:center
What difference does that make?

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.767 position:50% align:center
Those two aren't
Raiza'ha employees

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.185 position:50% align:center
like the rest of us are.

00:17:40.268 --> 00:17:42.437 position:50% align:center
Meaning the company
won't pay for them.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.522 position:50% align:center
Oh, and neither will I,
so don't ask.

00:17:44.606 --> 00:17:49.944 position:50% align:center
[grunts] No. This isn't
a problem at all!

00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:51.780 position:50% align:center
I have the ultimate
plan up my sleeve,

00:17:51.863 --> 00:17:53.782 position:50% align:center
and it makes me immune
to frivolous things

00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:55.325 position:50% align:center
such as paying a tab!

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:58.119 position:50% align:center
[KINJI laughs]

00:17:58.203 --> 00:17:59.662 position:50% align:center
Bring on the booze!

00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:04.125 position:50% align:center
I'll drink every last drop
of alcohol you've got!

00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:07.045 position:50% align:center
[KINJI retching]

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:09.464 position:50% align:center
Doesn't get more
irresponsible than this!

00:18:09.547 --> 00:18:11.007 position:50% align:center
You knew you had
work the next day,

00:18:11.091 --> 00:18:13.343 position:50% align:center
but you just drank
and drank and drank!

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:15.387 position:50% align:center
And now you're too
hungover to go in?

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:19.099 position:50% align:center
Can you turn the volume down?
Please? My head hur--

00:18:19.182 --> 00:18:20.684 position:50% align:center
Maybe you should think
about how your actions

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:22.727 position:50% align:center
affect the immediate future,
before worrying about

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:24.729 position:50% align:center
changing the future
300 years from now!

00:18:24.813 --> 00:18:26.731 position:50% align:center
Take Ranga, for example!

00:18:26.815 --> 00:18:31.027 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] An example of what?
What're ya going somewhere?

00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:32.487 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh!

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.197 position:50% align:center
I spoke with a really nice
director at the restaurant,

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.783 position:50% align:center
and he set me up with
a job interview today!

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:39.536 position:50% align:center
Can't expect Miss Shia to
let us live here for free!

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:40.745 position:50% align:center
I'll work real hard!

00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:43.289 position:50% align:center
A model employee
after my own heart.

00:18:43.373 --> 00:18:45.750 position:50% align:center
[KINJI grunts]

00:18:45.834 --> 00:18:47.544 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
I am not babysitting you.

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:49.587 position:50% align:center
Gonna get ready and
it's off to work I go.

00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:51.715 position:50% align:center
Oh, but good luck
on your interview!

00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:54.217 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Thank you! I'll do my best!

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.428 position:50% align:center
You're welcome to come
with me if you'd like, Rim!

00:18:56.511 --> 00:18:58.430 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
Mm...

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.391 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Wow...

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:05.770 position:50% align:center
So, this is what the world
was like 300 years ago.

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:11.234 position:50% align:center
Miss Shia gave me an allowance,

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:12.777 position:50% align:center
so I have money to
buy it if you want!

00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
Uh?

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:20.910 position:50% align:center
Ah! Cuteness overload!
You look fantastic!

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:22.579 position:50% align:center
You gonna get something
for yourself?

00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:24.789 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I heard there
are lots of neat outfits

00:19:24.873 --> 00:19:27.542 position:50% align:center
I can wear if I get this job
I'm interviewing for today!

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:30.211 position:50% align:center
So, I'll get mine soon enough!

00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:41.681 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] Looky, looky! That cloud
is shaped like a T-bone steak!

00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:43.641 position:50% align:center
Meat cloud.

00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:46.936 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Aw. Someone cut into it.

00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:54.069 position:50% align:center
The sky's really pretty, huh?
This is fun. Lots of fun!

00:19:54.152 --> 00:19:56.196 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:19:56.279 --> 00:20:00.533 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] Hm? That's the place!
Bye! I'll see ya later!

00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:01.576 position:50% align:center
[stomach grumbles]

00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:03.661 position:50% align:center
The sky...

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:07.123 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] I'm sorry to
inconvenience you as well.

00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:09.376 position:50% align:center
Go easy on the salt
next time, eh?

00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:11.753 position:50% align:center
I don't necessarily dislike it,
it's just noticeable.

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:13.171 position:50% align:center
What?

00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:15.632 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] I'm home! And I'm
officially employed here!

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:17.676 position:50% align:center
Offering customer service
while looking cute

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:20.261 position:50% align:center
is pretty much a
dream job for me!

00:20:20.345 --> 00:20:22.597 position:50% align:center
I was so excited,
I started right away!

00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:25.767 position:50% align:center
And, I got my first payout
since they pay daily!

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.143 position:50% align:center
Here! It's all yours!

00:20:27.227 --> 00:20:29.479 position:50% align:center
[SHIA gasping]
Thank you!

00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:31.439 position:50% align:center
[RIM belches]

00:20:31.523 --> 00:20:33.942 position:50% align:center
Oh. You stayed out
as late as I did.

00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:35.777 position:50% align:center
Yo, Rim, what's with
the new coat?

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.529 position:50% align:center
--[RIM] There we go.
--Least I think it's new.

00:20:37.612 --> 00:20:39.030 position:50% align:center
You look ready to pop!

00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:41.157 position:50% align:center
How many dumpsters worth of
garbage are in your stomach?

00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:43.660 position:50% align:center
Zero that I'm aware of.

00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:45.328 position:50% align:center
She didn't eat garbage.

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:48.415 position:50% align:center
Rim paid a visit to the Raiza'ha
dorms a little earlier.

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:49.499 position:50% align:center
And she made sure to eat

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:51.501 position:50% align:center
every single piece
of food in sight.

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:53.211 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:55.755 position:50% align:center
They told me to tell you that,
uh, they're gonna subtract it

00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:59.342 position:50% align:center
from your pay. But I didn't
remember until just now.

00:20:59.426 --> 00:21:01.469 position:50% align:center
My, what a sticky situation.

00:21:01.553 --> 00:21:04.389 position:50% align:center
Seems your debt's getting
bigger by the minute.

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:10.562 position:50% align:center
Accumulating debt is the least
of my concerns right now.

00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:12.480 position:50% align:center
I have a secret plan!

00:21:12.564 --> 00:21:15.066 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] You mentioned this
plan the other day, too.

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:16.860 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
So, you guys remember that story

00:21:16.943 --> 00:21:18.236 position:50% align:center
I told you about the future?

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:19.779 position:50% align:center
Kinda hard to forget
something like

00:21:19.863 --> 00:21:21.239 position:50% align:center
Raiza'ha conquering the world

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:24.951 position:50% align:center
thanks to ancient tech
they find in dungeon ruins.

00:21:25.035 --> 00:21:27.370 position:50% align:center
But! How much better would it be

00:21:27.454 --> 00:21:30.290 position:50% align:center
if I got my hands on
that ancient technology?

00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:32.876 position:50% align:center
Behold the party
of my ultimate plan!

00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:35.378 position:50% align:center
You lot may be lacking
in the brains department,

00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:37.630 position:50% align:center
but you're quite formidable
in terms of brawn!

00:21:37.714 --> 00:21:39.007 position:50% align:center
Under my guidance,

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.885 position:50% align:center
we'll overtake Belza and
reach the ruins in no time!

00:21:41.968 --> 00:21:45.388 position:50% align:center
And then! With superior
science and firepower,

00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:47.724 position:50% align:center
I'll achieve total
world domination!

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:49.893 position:50% align:center
I'll shape the entire
planet as I see fit!

00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:52.020 position:50% align:center
Establishing my ideal dystopia,

00:21:52.103 --> 00:21:54.314 position:50% align:center
complete with monuments
of me everywhere you look,

00:21:54.397 --> 00:21:56.816 position:50% align:center
on a foundation
as firm as bedrock!

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.152 position:50% align:center
Yes! "Operation:
Eternal Capital"

00:21:59.235 --> 00:22:00.820 position:50% align:center
has been stewing in
my brain for a while,

00:22:00.904 --> 00:22:03.031 position:50% align:center
but now it can finally
be put into motion!

00:22:03.114 --> 00:22:05.283 position:50% align:center
Bravo! I'm so proud of you!

00:22:05.367 --> 00:22:10.246 position:50% align:center
Sorry to interrupt, but there's
a bit of a wrench in your plan.
