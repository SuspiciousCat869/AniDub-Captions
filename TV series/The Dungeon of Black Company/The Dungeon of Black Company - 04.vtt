00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:17.517 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Ah, this sucks.
Might as well be feeding Rim

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.269 position:50% align:center
straight up gold since
everything I make

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.730 position:50% align:center
goes right to her stomach.

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:23.815 position:50% align:center
It's like monsters
are never content.

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:26.317 position:50% align:center
I mean, how do their
appetites even work?

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.028 position:50% align:center
[KINJI grunts]

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:32.699 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:39.247 position:50% align:center
Nice night, don't you think,
Mister Ninomiya?

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.458 position:50% align:center
There's a certain air
about it that really puts me

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:43.543 position:50% align:center
in the mood, if you
know what I mean.

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:47.422 position:50% align:center
By the way, you been paying off
your loan like a good boy?

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:49.674 position:50% align:center
Oh, that. Funny you should ask.

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:52.552 position:50% align:center
[FAU] You owe five million
gold of interest alone.

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:54.763 position:50% align:center
At this rate, I may have
to do something regrettable

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:57.140 position:50% align:center
like settling this
debt with your life.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.142 position:50% align:center
So if you'd prefer I not...

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.519 position:50% align:center
[KINJI groans]

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:05.231 position:50% align:center
You'll scrounge up the cash and
pay me back in full, dirtbag.

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:09.319 position:50% align:center
Bring me five million gold.
You have one month from today.

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:46.564 position:50% align:center
The man my father was...
I will never be like that.

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:48.108 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
You know, Mister Ninomiya,

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:50.527 position:50% align:center
I have every right to tear into
you for taking that photo

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.321 position:50% align:center
the other day and threatening
to smear my good name.

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:54.739 position:50% align:center
But I'll uphold that good name

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:57.075 position:50% align:center
and fulfill my responsibility
as a hero.

00:01:57.158 --> 00:02:00.870 position:50% align:center
No matter what, I will perform
my duties, just like always!

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:03.081 position:50% align:center
Let's redouble our efforts
and clear this dungeon

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:06.751 position:50% align:center
faster than you can say
piece of cake! Yeah!

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:08.211 position:50% align:center
Yeah...

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.171 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] I'm trying to put my
best foot forward here,

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:12.340 position:50% align:center
so I would appreciate
a little more enthusiasm.

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:15.051 position:50% align:center
It isn't you. He's been
like this all morning.

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:18.763 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] One month to repay
five million gold.

00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:20.682 position:50% align:center
What gives, lady? Let go!

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:22.892 position:50% align:center
You are in severe need
of a pick-me-up.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.228 position:50% align:center
And not just in
the literal sense.

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.814 position:50% align:center
In case you've forgotten,
I have a certain picture of you!

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:29.232 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm well aware.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:31.026 position:50% align:center
But even a guy like you
can't be opposed

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.902 position:50% align:center
to doing work
every now 'n' then!

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:35.447 position:50% align:center
I'll just slow you down,
which isn't efficient at all!

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.158 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] Only way to change that
is by learning in the field!

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.869 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Dammit! Not again!

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:43.079 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] Since you're both
complete and utter amateurs

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:44.789 position:50% align:center
with no prior combat experience,

00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:47.292 position:50% align:center
we'll take it easy and start
here on the second floor

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:49.461 position:50% align:center
to break you greenies in.

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:51.504 position:50% align:center
Follow me, you inept rookies!

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:53.423 position:50% align:center
Man, she's as
high-and-mighty as ever.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:55.884 position:50% align:center
Grates my nerves
in the worst way.

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:57.677 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
The key to dungeon exploration

00:02:57.761 --> 00:03:00.889 position:50% align:center
is remaining focused, so stay
on your guard at all times.

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:02.599 position:50% align:center
Danger can lurk
around every corner,

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.893 position:50% align:center
and you never know
what form it will take.

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:06.644 position:50% align:center
If you want to up your
chance of survival,

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:08.646 position:50% align:center
keep calm and levelheaded.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.315 position:50% align:center
That way you can make
the optimum decisions

00:03:10.398 --> 00:03:12.525 position:50% align:center
when it's time to do or die.

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.362 position:50% align:center
Please don't say the word die.

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.285 position:50% align:center
Are you boys ready?
Because we're going to slay

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:25.080 position:50% align:center
every last one
of those monsters!

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.213 position:50% align:center
[KINJI gasping]

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:36.174 position:50% align:center
Best way to learn is by doing,
so do whatever you can to win!

00:03:36.257 --> 00:03:38.343 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Seriously?!

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:40.929 position:50% align:center
Dirty, dangerous, and
demeaning! The Three Ds!

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:43.515 position:50% align:center
Don't move! [yells]

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:44.766 position:50% align:center
[HORNED WOLF A yelps]

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.935 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
Good work, gentlemen!

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:49.104 position:50% align:center
Oh, and keep in mind
the high amount of mana

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:50.730 position:50% align:center
in certain monster parts.

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:53.316 position:50% align:center
For horned wolves,
it's none other than the horn.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.151 position:50% align:center
We collect the most
mana-rich parts

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.112 position:50% align:center
and get money-rich
in the process.

00:03:57.195 --> 00:04:00.323 position:50% align:center
For reference, just how much
are these horns worth?

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:03.410 position:50% align:center
Let me think. One whole sack's

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:05.787 position:50% align:center
gotta be worth at
least 1,500 gold.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.166 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] A measly 1,500
for that many? Oh, no.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.504 position:50% align:center
I'll never make five million
gold in one month at that rate!

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:18.925 position:50% align:center
Wanibe, your tail. I didn't even
notice it already grew back.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.803 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] Hm? It's easily
replaceable, like us.

00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:24.222 position:50% align:center
Grows back right away.

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:26.099 position:50% align:center
That's it!

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:29.853 position:50% align:center
[BELZA]
For the last few months,

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.604 position:50% align:center
there have been blatantly
obvious signs

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:34.232 position:50% align:center
that a Death March will
soon be upon our dungeons.

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:36.026 position:50% align:center
It's usually once
every ten years,

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:37.902 position:50% align:center
which makes this quite bizarre.

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:40.321 position:50% align:center
During said Death March,
the demonite we've mined

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:43.158 position:50% align:center
and the monsters we've defeated
will return all at once.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.951 position:50% align:center
There's typically a
fair amount of damage,

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:47.996 position:50% align:center
but our profits also skyrocket,
so it evens out. This time--

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:50.623 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Are you confident
you're suited

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
to handle an event
that's so extraordinary?

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:56.212 position:50% align:center
Ha. At least we have time to
make plans and preparations,

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:59.257 position:50% align:center
unlike most hardships we had
to deal with back in my day.

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:02.969 position:50% align:center
I hear the Majin is expected
to rear its ugly head as well.

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center
[BELZA]
Did I leave anything out?

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
I suppose there are
those reports of

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:08.141 position:50% align:center
several employees'
questionable activities

00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:10.560 position:50% align:center
on the second floor.

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:13.772 position:50% align:center
But it's insignificant.
What we need to focus on now

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.565 position:50% align:center
is getting through
this Death March.

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:16.900 position:50% align:center
If we can do that safely,

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:20.028 position:50% align:center
my plans will come to
fruition without a hitch.

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:23.531 position:50% align:center
Bottom line, ensure
everything's under control.

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:26.701 position:50% align:center
Well, that's a given.
If our employees work together

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:30.413 position:50% align:center
with the same dedication
as always, we'll be fine.

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:50.767 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Welcome to Ninomiya's
Smiley-Town Monster Farm!

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.936 position:50% align:center
You'll hardly believe
your eyes when you see how

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.730 position:50% align:center
our local artisan ants have
transformed this dull,

00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
dingy dump of a dungeon into
a kid-friendly petting zoo!

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:02.487 position:50% align:center
It's barbaric to kill
and loot from monsters.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.365 position:50% align:center
They're strong yet peaceful
creatures full of life,

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:08.326 position:50% align:center
so why not just take what
we need and let them heal?

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.787 position:50% align:center
What? How long does
it take them to heal?

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center
Depends on the monster
and the part,

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.250 position:50% align:center
but most everything
grows back in three days.

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:17.627 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Critters that arrive at
our farm receive a brushing

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:19.045 position:50% align:center
from our professional groomer

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.715 position:50% align:center
to keep fur sleek
and tangle-free!

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:23.967 position:50% align:center
Thanks to our wolf-whisperer,
they're very obedient,

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.553 position:50% align:center
and petting them relieves
the stress I have from work.

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:29.848 position:50% align:center
Even monsters couldn't turn
down this genius proposal.

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:33.059 position:50% align:center
Yup, it's a true
win-win situation!

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:34.561 position:50% align:center
Although they're
only cooperating

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:36.396 position:50% align:center
because Rim
threatened their lives.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.816 position:50% align:center
[KINJI laughs]
This is the first cog

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:42.277 position:50% align:center
in the Dungeon Black
Company's industrial belt!

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.528 position:50% align:center
It's going so smoothly,

00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:46.114 position:50% align:center
I was able to pay off
my debt in record time!

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:49.034 position:50% align:center
No. This isn't how it should be.

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:52.662 position:50% align:center
I know it's easy money and
you're doing it well. But...

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:54.789 position:50% align:center
It's also basically...

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:56.249 position:50% align:center
Earthquake?

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:58.668 position:50% align:center
No, not now. [screams]

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:00.003 position:50% align:center
Shia!

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.213 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:11.056 position:50% align:center
Quite the rare occurrence

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:15.185 position:50% align:center
since you don't often check the
resumes in a place like this.

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:19.230 position:50% align:center
I need a new hero and quickly,
so it's not just any mining job.

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:22.484 position:50% align:center
[SECRETARY A] Ah. I feel rather
sorry for these heroes.

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:23.860 position:50% align:center
You mean because
the Death March

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:25.945 position:50% align:center
is approaching and the Majin
is going to attack them

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:28.823 position:50% align:center
in attempt to regain
the magic it's lost?

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:33.119 position:50% align:center
The most efficient response is
to feed it somebody powerful.

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:35.872 position:50% align:center
I must admit, Miss Shia
never seems to disappoint

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.582 position:50% align:center
when it comes to
generating revenue

00:07:37.665 --> 00:07:39.542 position:50% align:center
for her beloved company.

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:43.129 position:50% align:center
May she be just as
useful as a sacrifice.

00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:44.798 position:50% align:center
[KINJI yells]

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:45.632 position:50% align:center
[BIRD MONSTER A groans]

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:47.133 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:49.469 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:51.346 position:50% align:center
Please stop screaming in my ear!

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:53.556 position:50% align:center
I don't know why you're making
all those effort sounds

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.225 position:50% align:center
when I'm the one
doing all the work!

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:58.436 position:50% align:center
Shut up! I'm yelling because
you're zooming around

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.314 position:50% align:center
like a superhero and I'm
trying my best not to fall!

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:05.151 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] You big baby. But
speaking of superheroes--

00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:06.778 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you tried to save me.

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:09.864 position:50% align:center
Even though your attempt
was a total failure,

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:11.950 position:50% align:center
it's good to see someone
I deemed heartless

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.326 position:50% align:center
has a heart after all.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.246 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Well, excuse me, princess.

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:17.539 position:50% align:center
[SHIA giggles]

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:19.332 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] In any case,
we need to get out of this

00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:22.293 position:50% align:center
monster-infested pit
of despair, pronto.

00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:25.088 position:50% align:center
Got an escape item on ya?

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:28.133 position:50% align:center
--[SHIA] Of course.
--You actually do?!

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.430 position:50% align:center
It's an extremely valuable
item known as a shift crystal.

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.265 position:50% align:center
But how wasteful
would it be to use it

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:37.934 position:50% align:center
in such a mundane
situation like this one?

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:40.228 position:50% align:center
And truth be told,
the prospect of working our way

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:42.939 position:50% align:center
out of this mess is
much more exciting to me!

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:45.108 position:50% align:center
I'm not trying to kink-shame
you or anything,

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.152 position:50% align:center
but now's not the time.

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:48.862 position:50% align:center
[roaring]

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:56.119 position:50% align:center
I guess maybe now is the time.

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.246 position:50% align:center
Take him out real quick, yeah?

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:03.585 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Shia!

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:04.919 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
Stay where you are!

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:08.256 position:50% align:center
Whatever bone it has to
pick seems to be with me.

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:21.144 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:29.861 position:50% align:center
It's incredible! Is it a Majin?

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.783 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
I see. This is why...

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:38.411 position:50% align:center
Why I was brought to
the Detmolt branch!

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:40.080 position:50% align:center
[SHIA grunts]

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.960 position:50% align:center
[KINJI grunts]
Let's pull back.

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:52.050 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:55.929 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Just coming to terms
with my grim reality.

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:58.014 position:50% align:center
At best, I'll die
with the Majin.

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:00.016 position:50% align:center
Worst, I'll eventually
lose my strength

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.602 position:50% align:center
and then that thing
will torture me to death.

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:04.479 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
So what's the plan?

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:06.022 position:50% align:center
Well, what's my job?

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:08.316 position:50% align:center
To slay every monster
I come across.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.404 position:50% align:center
I'll fulfill that
duty till the end.

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:13.863 position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:16.741 position:50% align:center
Let's use that returning item
and get outta here.

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:18.535 position:50% align:center
Be stingy another time.

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:21.287 position:50% align:center
--No. That's not how it works.
--Huh?

00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:22.789 position:50% align:center
It's only good for one.

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:25.917 position:50% align:center
Shift crystals
transport single targets.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:30.213 position:50% align:center
Mister Ninomiya. Go ahead
and leave without me.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.757 position:50% align:center
Giving up a little too
prematurely, doncha think?

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:35.760 position:50% align:center
Raiza'ha has blessed me in
so many ways over the years.

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:39.305 position:50% align:center
So I can't simply up
and abandon my duty.

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:41.850 position:50% align:center
It's been interesting.
Take care.

00:10:41.933 --> 00:10:44.227 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Wait! Don't do this!

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.062 position:50% align:center
You like taking
out loans, right?

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:48.440 position:50% align:center
How about we just say
you owe me one?

00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:50.567 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.402 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
Goodbye.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:56.239 position:50% align:center
No! I refuse!

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.074 position:50% align:center
[SHIA gasps]

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:08.585 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
Huh?

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:11.129 position:50% align:center
The demonite should have
reemerged by now.

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:13.089 position:50% align:center
So, how goes the mining process?

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:15.258 position:50% align:center
Well, thing is,
the dead monsters

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:17.677 position:50% align:center
have also reemerged,
so we can't mine.

00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:19.554 position:50% align:center
Our employees still
have quotas to meet,

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:21.139 position:50% align:center
and I expect you'll
keep them working

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:22.766 position:50% align:center
until they reach every goal.

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:25.185 position:50% align:center
[GOBLIN BOSS]
O-Of course!

00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:27.437 position:50% align:center
It really is a death march.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.605 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.482 position:50% align:center
What?

00:11:35.487 --> 00:11:38.031 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Hey. Hey!

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:40.241 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] Omigosh! Do you have
the slightest idea

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:42.535 position:50% align:center
what kind of consequences
this is going to have?

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:43.995 position:50% align:center
I know what I did.

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:46.664 position:50% align:center
Sent that giant jerk on a
one-way trip to the surface.

00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:48.541 position:50% align:center
Which saved both of our
lives in the process,

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:49.668 position:50% align:center
I'd like to add.

00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50% align:center
You're missing
the bigger picture!

00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:52.921 position:50% align:center
Don't know if you noticed,
but that thing

00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:56.466 position:50% align:center
is 100% locked on you
for one reason or another.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:58.593 position:50% align:center
Wherever you are
is where it'll go.

00:11:58.677 --> 00:12:00.887 position:50% align:center
So what you're saying
is you bought us time?

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.098 position:50% align:center
Yup. Bingo. Remember this:

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:04.557 position:50% align:center
I'm nothing like
the other grunts

00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:06.184 position:50% align:center
that you've come to know.

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:08.728 position:50% align:center
The man you see before
you is an original.

00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:11.523 position:50% align:center
Me! The only one in existence!

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:13.817 position:50% align:center
[GUARD A] We have confirmed
the presence of a Majin!

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.487 position:50% align:center
Somebody must have used
transportation magic!

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.031 position:50% align:center
The heck did you idiots
do to allow that thing

00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:21.866 position:50% align:center
to get all the way to
the surface level?

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.451 position:50% align:center
Your guess is as good as mine!

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:25.328 position:50% align:center
We've all been
following protocol!

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:27.247 position:50% align:center
[GUARD A] It's destroying
everything in its path

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.124 position:50% align:center
as it heads back to the dungeon!

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:30.750 position:50% align:center
Despicable.

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
What inconsiderate fool would
commit such an offense?

00:12:35.547 --> 00:12:37.048 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Pick up the pace!

00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:41.845 position:50% align:center
Make every second count, 'cause
we don't have time to spare!

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:43.513 position:50% align:center
[GUARD A] The Majin
successfully broke through

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:46.391 position:50% align:center
the third floor's seal!
And it's still on the move!

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:47.934 position:50% align:center
Extreme danger!

00:12:48.018 --> 00:12:51.688 position:50% align:center
All workers, please. Wha--?
Dungeon Master?

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.690 position:50% align:center
[BELZA] Do everything
in your power to stop it!

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:55.025 position:50% align:center
If it causes any more damage,

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:57.569 position:50% align:center
I'll subtract the cost
from your salaries!

00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:00.947 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
Hey! Ninomiya!

00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:06.828 position:50% align:center
Where'd you run off to?
I hope it's someplace safe.

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:09.164 position:50% align:center
Hm? Hi, Mister Ant.

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:13.793 position:50% align:center
Frontline force, go ahead
and get in position now!

00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:14.878 position:50% align:center
Did you find Rim?

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:16.296 position:50% align:center
I did not.

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:19.215 position:50% align:center
Great, the one time I need
her she's, of course, MIA.

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:21.176 position:50% align:center
Ah, there you are!

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:23.553 position:50% align:center
Though it took a minute,
at least you're dependable.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:26.473 position:50% align:center
You have no idea how glad
I am to see you're safe!

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:29.684 position:50% align:center
But, uh... Do you mind if I ask
why you're camped out down here

00:13:29.768 --> 00:13:31.811 position:50% align:center
with your ant legion
in a time of crisis?

00:13:31.895 --> 00:13:34.481 position:50% align:center
Well, let me tell you.

00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:40.278 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] It's a little something
called a "boss fight."

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:42.572 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:45.700 position:50% align:center
Thank you for coming all the way
to the den of your demise!

00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:47.994 position:50% align:center
Your fate was sealed as
soon as you crossed me!

00:13:48.078 --> 00:13:50.330 position:50% align:center
Now you'll never forget
the name Ninomiya!

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:53.416 position:50% align:center
At least for the last few
seconds of your life!

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.586 position:50% align:center
It's time! Sayonara.

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:00.674 position:50% align:center
Aw, yeah!

00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:05.470 position:50% align:center
Alpha team, begin deploying
cement! Lock the Majin in place!

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:08.473 position:50% align:center
You're up. Unleash
your spell at max output.

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:11.017 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:14:15.647 --> 00:14:17.315 position:50% align:center
Nice! People should use magic

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:19.818 position:50% align:center
to make cement dry
super quick all the time!

00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:25.031 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] What kind of fighting
style is this supposed to be?

00:14:25.115 --> 00:14:26.616 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Ah, crap. It didn't hold.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.369 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
That just made it angrier!

00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:33.289 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Alpha team, fall back!
We're proceeding with plan B!

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:35.625 position:50% align:center
Shia. Rim still isn't here.

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:38.670 position:50% align:center
Which means you're the greatest
tactical asset we have.

00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:41.548 position:50% align:center
But I'm also aware
you're injured.

00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:44.718 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] Oh, right.
I've recovered a little bit,

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:46.428 position:50% align:center
but I'm still not
at full strength.

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:48.722 position:50% align:center
Gonna take some time
before I'm all healed.

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:51.224 position:50% align:center
That's fine.
I want you to rest up until

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:53.435 position:50% align:center
we actually need
your assistance.

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:55.020 position:50% align:center
It's gonna take a critical hit,

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:58.440 position:50% align:center
which can only be executed
if the timing is perfect.

00:14:58.523 --> 00:15:00.859 position:50% align:center
--That's so inspiring!
--Wow, how inspiring.

00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:03.945 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:15:04.029 --> 00:15:06.364 position:50% align:center
You told me to rest,
so why am I tied to a stake?

00:15:06.448 --> 00:15:08.908 position:50% align:center
Because you can still be useful
even if you're recovering!

00:15:08.992 --> 00:15:10.994 position:50% align:center
So just close your eyes,
focus on healing,

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:13.955 position:50% align:center
and just ignore the giant
creature that's chasing you.

00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:16.332 position:50% align:center
It is not letting up! Oh-ho!

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:19.502 position:50% align:center
I think someone's
got a crush! How cute.

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:23.590 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] "Crush." Hilarious.
It seems especially vicious.

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:26.676 position:50% align:center
Makes me wonder if its hunger
is the only thing driving it.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.054 position:50% align:center
In order to kill it, we need
to pump enough magic power

00:15:29.137 --> 00:15:31.348 position:50% align:center
into one solid, lethal blow

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:34.559 position:50% align:center
or we'll have to resort to
purely physical means.

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:37.312 position:50% align:center
Good thing you have me, eh?

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:41.024 position:50% align:center
Bravo team! Begin operation!

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.159 position:50% align:center
The monsters from the farm

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:53.286 position:50% align:center
are performing even
better than I thought.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.498 position:50% align:center
All thanks to your translations,
communications manager.

00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:58.625 position:50% align:center
Oh, please, you flatter me.

00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:01.586 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Ready, Wanibe?
Time for the final touch.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.797 position:50% align:center
Huh? You mean right now?

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.300 position:50% align:center
That mucus is highly flammable.

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:12.013 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:16:12.097 --> 00:16:13.515 position:50% align:center
Burn its carcass to a crisp!

00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:16.601 position:50% align:center
Leave nothing but the ashes
and the smell of its defeat!

00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:18.728 position:50% align:center
This is such a dastardly
way to fight.

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:22.816 position:50% align:center
[KINJI laughing]
I'll take that as a compliment.

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:29.989 position:50% align:center
--[KINJI gasps]
--[SHIA] Watch out!

00:16:30.073 --> 00:16:31.783 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:34.035 position:50% align:center
[KINJI grunting]

00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:37.330 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] It's confused and
attacking indiscriminately.

00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:40.000 position:50% align:center
This is bad. All we can do is--

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:43.128 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Sacrifice yourself
in a last-ditch attack?

00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:46.047 position:50% align:center
Stop it. We don't need
that kind of mentality.

00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:47.716 position:50% align:center
You're the one who should stop!

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:49.092 position:50% align:center
Give up your elaborate plans

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:51.177 position:50% align:center
and simply let me
fulfill my mission!

00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:54.806 position:50% align:center
I'm okay with it,
so why aren't you?

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:57.559 position:50% align:center
That obstinate way
of thinking you have...

00:16:57.642 --> 00:16:59.686 position:50% align:center
You didn't adopt it because
of your dear old dad,

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:02.522 position:50% align:center
the so-called King of Failed
Ventures, now did you?

00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:04.858 position:50% align:center
How do you know about my father?

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:08.236 position:50% align:center
You're unpredictable, but
you're also a part of my team.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.739 position:50% align:center
So I did some research
to learn what I was in for.

00:17:10.822 --> 00:17:12.991 position:50% align:center
Rumor has it your father
was this outrageous

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:14.284 position:50% align:center
thrill-seeker who ran around

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:16.578 position:50% align:center
clearing out dungeons
far and wide.

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:19.581 position:50% align:center
Yes, very accurate. Although,

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:22.459 position:50% align:center
I doubt you know how
tough it was for his family.

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:24.836 position:50% align:center
That man abandoned
my mother and me.

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:26.755 position:50% align:center
Until I started
working for Raiza'ha,

00:17:26.838 --> 00:17:28.548 position:50% align:center
our lives were miserable!

00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:31.509 position:50% align:center
So, I try to live properly
and work properly!

00:17:31.593 --> 00:17:34.137 position:50% align:center
That's what it means to
be a member of society!

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.015 position:50% align:center
Because of Raiza'ha, I learned
how wonderful work is!

00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:38.975 position:50% align:center
I learned the value of
contributing to society

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:41.644 position:50% align:center
and how fulfilling just
doing your part can be!

00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:45.106 position:50% align:center
I also learned people who live
like my father are plain wrong.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:49.152 position:50% align:center
It's the truth. 'Cause if
it were any other way--

00:17:50.862 --> 00:17:53.198 position:50% align:center
[SHIA gasping]

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.450 position:50% align:center
Your heart is racing.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.371 position:50% align:center
Well, the last thing that's
gonna calm me down

00:17:59.454 --> 00:18:00.872 position:50% align:center
is touching my boobs!

00:18:00.955 --> 00:18:03.833 position:50% align:center
Right. Got it.
But more importantly,

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:06.836 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure I've got
the gist of it now.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.588 position:50% align:center
Why your personality
is paper-thin

00:18:08.672 --> 00:18:09.964 position:50% align:center
and always wavering, I mean.

00:18:10.048 --> 00:18:10.882 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:12.092 position:50% align:center
Every chance you get,

00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:14.302 position:50% align:center
you go off about the
significance of work.

00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:17.138 position:50% align:center
But nothing you say is
rooted in your own will.

00:18:17.222 --> 00:18:19.432 position:50% align:center
You're just spouting nonsense
you think people around you

00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:22.352 position:50% align:center
want you to say, and
those words have no weight.

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:25.730 position:50% align:center
In truth, you work because
you feel obligated to.

00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
No! That's not it!

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
I don't like it, but I know
there's nothing inherently wrong

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:33.029 position:50% align:center
with work. But as of right now,
you're just brainwashed

00:18:33.113 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center
by thoughts that benefit
Raiza'ha and no one else.

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:38.660 position:50% align:center
You are in no way,
shape, or form

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:41.162 position:50% align:center
beholden to give
your life for them!

00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:42.497 position:50% align:center
Listen, Shia.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.833 position:50% align:center
The ties to your father
don't exist, so cut them!

00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:49.129 position:50% align:center
Don't give puppeteers
strings they can use!

00:18:49.212 --> 00:18:51.715 position:50% align:center
Please, live your life in
whatever way that you feel

00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:56.177 position:50% align:center
is right. Be free, Shia. Free!

00:18:57.929 --> 00:19:00.640 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] I knew his back
better than his front.

00:19:00.724 --> 00:19:05.311 position:50% align:center
But every time he left on
one of his adventures

00:19:05.395 --> 00:19:11.985 position:50% align:center
he always seemed
so free and full of joy.

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:15.238 position:50% align:center
I really loved that about Dad.

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:20.869 position:50% align:center
If you don't understand
the meaning of freedom,

00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:24.748 position:50% align:center
then let me teach you
with this crash course!

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:27.959 position:50% align:center
Begin plan C!

00:19:30.962 --> 00:19:33.965 position:50% align:center
[KINJI laughs]
I thought something like this

00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:36.384 position:50% align:center
might happen, so I stole
company equipment.

00:19:36.468 --> 00:19:38.219 position:50% align:center
You're witnessing how
a guy wholly devoted

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:40.388 position:50% align:center
to freedom fights his battles!

00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:42.474 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
It's horrible.

00:19:42.557 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
Okay, Shia.

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:46.603 position:50% align:center
Safe to say it's pretty
worn down by now.

00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:49.147 position:50% align:center
You got the energy to finish it?

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:53.026 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
Yeah. Just enough, I think!

00:19:57.072 --> 00:20:00.742 position:50% align:center
[SHIA yells]

00:20:09.793 --> 00:20:11.628 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:13.672 position:50% align:center
Victory has never tasted
this sweet before

00:20:13.755 --> 00:20:15.965 position:50% align:center
and the glory is all mine!

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:18.009 position:50% align:center
The Majin is nothing
but an insect

00:20:18.093 --> 00:20:19.803 position:50% align:center
to the great Ninomiya!

00:20:19.886 --> 00:20:22.138 position:50% align:center
But who would expect
anything less?

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:27.102 position:50% align:center
Ah... And speaking of
such expectations.

00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:31.147 position:50% align:center
Most bosses do tend
to revive once.

00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:33.441 position:50% align:center
--No, Ninomiya!
--Ninomiya!

00:20:36.945 --> 00:20:38.697 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasping]

00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:43.952 position:50% align:center
Although I'd like to say
that was part of the plan,

00:20:44.035 --> 00:20:47.997 position:50% align:center
I have to admit, it was a
little too close for comfort.

00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:52.460 position:50% align:center
I'm the only one
who can eat Kinji.

00:20:52.544 --> 00:20:55.630 position:50% align:center
Don't take food that
doesn't belong to you.

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:04.431 position:50% align:center
[roaring]

00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:12.397 position:50% align:center
[KINJI grunting]

00:21:20.822 --> 00:21:24.075 position:50% align:center
I think I saw my life flash
before my eyes just now.

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:27.078 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot, Rim. I swear...

00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:29.205 position:50% align:center
That Majin thing
wasn't playing around.

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:32.334 position:50% align:center
You think so? That one
was incomplete, though.

00:21:32.417 --> 00:21:34.794 position:50% align:center
What? What does that mean?

00:21:34.878 --> 00:21:36.755 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
It wasn't born normally.

00:21:36.838 --> 00:21:39.299 position:50% align:center
Because I've been
living outside.

00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:42.302 position:50% align:center
What it was doing
was calling for help.

00:21:42.385 --> 00:21:44.304 position:50% align:center
You're making even
less sense than usual.

00:21:44.387 --> 00:21:46.765 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
Hey! Are you still alive?

00:21:46.848 --> 00:21:48.933 position:50% align:center
Either way,
I'll be right down, okay?

00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:50.935 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:21:51.019 --> 00:21:52.437 position:50% align:center
That was tough!

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.856 position:50% align:center
But at least we all
made it in one piece.

00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:58.860 position:50% align:center
We should grab some
drinks to celebrate.

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:01.529 position:50% align:center
You get to eat whatever you
want today as a reward.

00:22:01.613 --> 00:22:03.114 position:50% align:center
So what're you hungry for?

00:22:03.198 --> 00:22:04.616 position:50% align:center
Some meat.

00:22:04.699 --> 00:22:08.411 position:50% align:center
You need veggies, too. Hm?
What's this weird, glowy thing?

00:22:08.495 --> 00:22:10.246 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
Beats me.

00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:16.252 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Hang on!
It's just like that day!

00:22:16.336 --> 00:22:19.714 position:50% align:center
[KINJI screaming]
