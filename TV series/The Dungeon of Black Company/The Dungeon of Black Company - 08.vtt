00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:14.556 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] I was only gone
for a month. Just one!

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.141 position:50% align:center
How could the dungeon's
difficulty level

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:17.642 position:50% align:center
increase so much?

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:19.144 position:50% align:center
It sucks, but still...

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:21.771 position:50% align:center
One way or another,
we are conquering that thing.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.815 position:50% align:center
If Belza gets there first,
we might as well

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:25.817 position:50% align:center
hand the world over
in a gift basket.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.237 position:50% align:center
So it's up to us to reach
those ruins before she does.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.572 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
Mm-hm.

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:32.657 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] And with the power
of ancient technology,

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:35.326 position:50% align:center
we'll pay off all of my loans!

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.578 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:38.747 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] Can you explain
how paying off your debt

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.498 position:50% align:center
is our problem, too?

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:42.375 position:50% align:center
It's exactly like it sounds!

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:44.502 position:50% align:center
Forcing us to help you
settle your credit under

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:47.172 position:50% align:center
the guise of saving the world
borders on the line of evil!

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:49.257 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] Pure evil!
What kind of mooch puts

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:52.802 position:50% align:center
women and children in danger
just so he can make some coin?

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:55.347 position:50% align:center
Doesn't get much more
unreliable than that.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.848 position:50% align:center
Shut up!

00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:59.100 position:50% align:center
Says the man making a racket!

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:01.561 position:50% align:center
I am not a chew toy, let go!

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:03.605 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:06.191 position:50% align:center
Oh. Before it slips
my mind, here.

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:09.152 position:50% align:center
It would do you well
to look this over.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.820 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Looks boring, what is it?

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:13.198 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] A copy of our statistical
evaluation sheets

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:15.867 position:50% align:center
that I took the liberty
of borrowing from HQ.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:16.951 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Why?

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:19.245 position:50% align:center
I was hoping this would
paint a visual.

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.790 position:50% align:center
The average adventurer
achieves level 20.

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:24.751 position:50% align:center
Mister Ninomiya,
you are at level five!

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:26.086 position:50% align:center
You weakling!

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:28.546 position:50% align:center
A slime could pick a fight
with you and win!

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.923 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
You think?

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:31.007 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
I know!

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.384 position:50% align:center
It'd be a miracle
if you don't die

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:34.135 position:50% align:center
the second you set
foot in those caves!

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:35.887 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Tch.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.555 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
But never fear!

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:39.516 position:50% align:center
Because starting
today, you, sir,

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.351 position:50% align:center
are going to undergo
Kinou Shia's

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:44.270 position:50% align:center
Short and Intensive Training!

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:46.231 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Wh--?

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.040 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] First, we work on your
raising your stamina!

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:29.334 position:50% align:center
Let's see some hustle!

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:32.587 position:50% align:center
Run, boys, run!

00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:34.130 position:50% align:center
Gosh! You guys are so slow,

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:37.967 position:50% align:center
you won't even outrun
legless monsters!

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.428 position:50% align:center
Do better!

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.562 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] Come on!
Keep those shoulders up!

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.898 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Keep that mouth shut!

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.737 position:50% align:center
[KINJI grunting]

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:03.535 position:50% align:center
You're too heavy.

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:07.122 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] Nope!
No talking during this drill!

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:08.707 position:50% align:center
[KINJI yelping]

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.209 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] So close!
Only 30 more seconds to go!

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:13.962 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Hot, hot, hot!

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:20.218 position:50% align:center
I present your next task!

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:23.930 position:50% align:center
Built for developing
magic power!

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:27.183 position:50% align:center
We adventurers use magic to
enhance our physical abilities.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:30.395 position:50% align:center
It varies, of course, but never
fails to make us hit harder.

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:33.815 position:50% align:center
It all really depends on the
natural talent of the fighter.

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:35.191 position:50% align:center
I know what you're thinking,

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.235 position:50% align:center
but I'll make sure even a
hopeless rookie like you

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:39.154 position:50% align:center
can harness the magic
within your body.

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:42.949 position:50% align:center
Well, the thing is, I don't have
any magic within my body.

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:44.617 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
That you know of!

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:48.079 position:50% align:center
But this exercise I created
will activate your sixth sense!

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:49.914 position:50% align:center
--It works--!
--[KINJI] I know how it works!

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:52.625 position:50% align:center
Those logs are gonna come
flying at me from all sides!

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:56.004 position:50% align:center
Oh! How did you
figure out my drill?

00:04:56.087 --> 00:05:00.050 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Are you an idiot, Shia?
Shia, really! Are you an idiot?

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.718 position:50% align:center
I am not an idiot.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.720 position:50% align:center
I'm just saying from
firsthand experience

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:05.555 position:50% align:center
this exercise works
like a charm.

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:07.390 position:50% align:center
--[KINJI grumbling]
--Uh?

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:11.019 position:50% align:center
No! It's break time!
Starting right now!

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:18.276 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Need an energy boost?

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.905 position:50% align:center
Here! Take this!
It'll perk you up!

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:23.907 position:50% align:center
Nice. Thanks, Ranga.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.617 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] And here's yours,
Mister Wanibe.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.786 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
You're worse than I imagined.

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:30.455 position:50% align:center
I could help hone a specific
skill if I knew what abilities

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:32.415 position:50% align:center
you possessed, but from
everything that you've shown me,

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:36.211 position:50% align:center
I don't have the faintest idea.

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:41.174 position:50% align:center
Go! Go! Go!

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:43.259 position:50% align:center
Perhaps the only
special thing about you

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.470 position:50% align:center
is your ability to
manipulate others.

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:47.847 position:50% align:center
Tch.

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.642 position:50% align:center
Uh? This is good.

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:53.311 position:50% align:center
Well, it's apparently a potion
mixed with flavored syrups,

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:56.147 position:50% align:center
so it's less expensive
than the real stuff,

00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:57.899 position:50% align:center
but still pretty popular anyway!

00:05:57.982 --> 00:06:02.028 position:50% align:center
So, basically an energy
drink, huh? Aw, damn it.

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:04.906 position:50% align:center
These didn't exist
when I first got here?

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:07.075 position:50% align:center
I should have filed a
patent when I made those

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:08.868 position:50% align:center
watered-down potions back then.

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:10.954 position:50% align:center
Hey, um. What's a "patent"?

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:13.832 position:50% align:center
Focus! What I'm saying
concerns your level!

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:15.458 position:50% align:center
I heard you, Miss Shia.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.086 position:50% align:center
You were realizing Ninomiya
is one thing: worthless.

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.087 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.088 position:50% align:center
Yes. Correct.

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:21.214 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Hey!

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:22.757 position:50% align:center
Look at you!

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:25.719 position:50% align:center
Statistically speaking, that's
really impressive in a way.

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
How inept you are, I mean.

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:30.306 position:50% align:center
Gee. You're so gracious.
More importantly,

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.143 position:50% align:center
what's this "level" thing
you keep mentioning?

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:37.480 position:50% align:center
Not like we're in a game and
get XP for killing monsters.

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:40.066 position:50% align:center
Wait. Where'd you get
an idea like that?

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.401 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:43.194 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] Actually, I think
you've run your mouth

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:45.905 position:50% align:center
more than you have your feet,
so break time's over.

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:47.574 position:50% align:center
Let's get back to training!

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:49.367 position:50% align:center
I already told you no!

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:51.369 position:50% align:center
If something like this could
teach a person magic,

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:54.706 position:50% align:center
all the people in my world
would be freaking wizards!

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:57.083 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] Good grief. I feel
like everything I said

00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:59.711 position:50% align:center
went in one ear
and out the other.

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:03.256 position:50% align:center
This exercise is for feeling
the magic within, not using it.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.216 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Okay, okay, okay! Back up!

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.635 position:50% align:center
That's another thing
you keep talking about.

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:10.847 position:50% align:center
"Magic power." Could I
get a textbook definition?

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.475 position:50% align:center
Sure, but that's a
rather odd question.

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:16.186 position:50% align:center
It's airborne mana, or at
least what it is when you

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:19.105 position:50% align:center
convert it into a force that
has an effect on the world.

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:22.025 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Could I get a dumber
textbook's definition?

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.235 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] When manifested for
practical applications,

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:25.862 position:50% align:center
it's referred to as "magic."

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:27.739 position:50% align:center
The crystalized form
you see in dungeons

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:30.116 position:50% align:center
is "demonite." And if it's
used in conjunction

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.702 position:50% align:center
with formulas, it's "sorcery."

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:35.580 position:50% align:center
It's all essential energy for
maintaining our daily lives

00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:37.332 position:50% align:center
when you get down to it.

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:40.669 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised you'd have to ask
about something so basic.

00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:42.462 position:50% align:center
Wait. Earlier you
said you enhance

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:44.589 position:50% align:center
your physical skills
with magic, right?

00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:47.467 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] What's so hard
to grasp about that?

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.553 position:50% align:center
You circulate the magic you gain
from mana throughout your body,

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:52.889 position:50% align:center
allowing you to raise
your physical abilities

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:55.100 position:50% align:center
beyond their mortal limits.

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:56.476 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:58.770 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] What? Don't tell me
you thought I was able

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:00.480 position:50% align:center
to fight those monsters
the way I did

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:03.108 position:50% align:center
because of diet and exercise.

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:04.693 position:50% align:center
So, it's not.

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:08.113 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Okay, listen up.

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:09.698 position:50% align:center
Mana is breathed in
from the mouth

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:12.200 position:50% align:center
and processed by
the mystic heart.

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:14.452 position:50% align:center
Then it's pumped through
your meridians

00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:16.996 position:50% align:center
and then bent to your will!

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:24.879 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] How could I forget?
This isn't my world.

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:26.923 position:50% align:center
I'm a total moron.

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:29.259 position:50% align:center
Just because we appear
similar on the outside

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:33.096 position:50% align:center
doesn't mean we're
the same on the inside.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.766 position:50% align:center
Eh? Hang on.
If that's the case...

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:42.689 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. Am I the weakest person
on the face of this planet?

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:48.194 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] You know what?
I'm not the least bit surprised.

00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:50.739 position:50% align:center
Life is never that easy!

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.869 position:50% align:center
I got my hopes up,
to tell you the truth.

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:57.620 position:50% align:center
Although, not much.

00:08:57.704 --> 00:08:59.122 position:50% align:center
I was like, "Whoa!

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:03.418 position:50% align:center
I'm some kinda fantasy hero
if I can learn magic!" Psh.

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:06.046 position:50% align:center
Dumb part of me
deserves to rot!

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:09.758 position:50% align:center
I think you've had enough.
Maybe make this your last round.

00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:12.385 position:50% align:center
Speaking of dumb,
that dumb Shia.

00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:13.887 position:50% align:center
Smiling at a broken man

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.222 position:50% align:center
while you say the words
that break him.

00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:18.016 position:50% align:center
Oh! I see!

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:21.853 position:50% align:center
You're physically incapable of
tapping into your magic power.

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:24.689 position:50% align:center
Oh! Don't take it so hard!
Y'know, nothing's stopping us

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:26.483 position:50% align:center
from training your
muscles, right?

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:29.319 position:50% align:center
Training is forever,
as they say!

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:33.615 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Her brain might as well
be an extra pair of biceps.

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:38.661 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Damn it!

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:41.289 position:50% align:center
I've learned my lesson
loud and clear this time!

00:09:41.373 --> 00:09:45.251 position:50% align:center
I'm a complete outsider here
no matter what I do!

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:46.920 position:50% align:center
I wanna go back to the life

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:49.589 position:50% align:center
where I didn't have a
single care in the world!

00:09:49.673 --> 00:09:52.342 position:50% align:center
I'm doing everything I
can to turn my lemons

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:56.471 position:50% align:center
into lemonade and
make myself happy!

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:59.307 position:50% align:center
So why? Why does
everything I work for

00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:03.269 position:50% align:center
slip through my fingers?
It's not fair.

00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50% align:center
Enough! It stops here!

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:07.649 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna drink
this cheap booze!

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:10.026 position:50% align:center
I wanna shower in
the good stuff, damn it!

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.987 position:50% align:center
I want giant mountains of
money I can actually climb

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:15.990 position:50% align:center
so I never have to work again
for the rest of my life!

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.785 position:50% align:center
Yes! The kind of money
that I had back in Japan!

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:20.662 position:50% align:center
I want that life
more than anything!

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:23.581 position:50% align:center
I want the life of
a perfect NEET!

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:26.167 position:50% align:center
If there are any
gods in this world,

00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:30.922 position:50% align:center
I curse them with
every fiber of my being.

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:33.758 position:50% align:center
Please bear in mind
we're in public.

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:39.347 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I'm good now.

00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:42.642 position:50% align:center
Man. How cathartic. I had all
of that jumbled up inside,

00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:45.353 position:50% align:center
but getting it off my chest
helped me sort things out.

00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:48.064 position:50% align:center
Well, that was a sudden
and drastic change.

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:50.734 position:50% align:center
I guess what I'm really longing
for is that self-sufficient,

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:53.069 position:50% align:center
layabout lifestyle
I had back in Japan.

00:10:53.153 --> 00:10:56.239 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Look at my
subconscious hard at work.

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:57.782 position:50% align:center
My goal hasn't wavered once.

00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:59.576 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE] He went from
being an emotional drunk

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.787 position:50% align:center
to an intellectual! Impressive!

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:07.792 position:50% align:center
[RANGA]
Okay! Stop right where you are!

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:10.003 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
The Calonian ruins.

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:11.713 position:50% align:center
I can't deny how
intriguing I find

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:14.382 position:50% align:center
the prospect of
controlling the world.

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:16.551 position:50% align:center
I have to make that power mine.

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:18.928 position:50% align:center
But how can I when
I'm not strong enough

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:20.847 position:50% align:center
to survive in the dungeon?

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.183 position:50% align:center
Then again,
I suppose I don't have

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:25.143 position:50% align:center
to be the one
doing the fighting.

00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:28.104 position:50% align:center
Maybe I can get Rim and the
others to handle all the combat

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:31.191 position:50% align:center
while I focus on support.

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:33.026 position:50% align:center
No. Scratch that.

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:36.363 position:50% align:center
Absolute chaos would ensue if
I let those idiots run amok.

00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:39.616 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] You ready for me,
Star-Gun-Magical-Chaser?

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.826 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
Rawr! Bring it!

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.496 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Should I add more
people to our party?

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:47.415 position:50% align:center
Nah. If there's no guarantee
I can control them,

00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50% align:center
there's no guarantee
I can trust them.

00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:53.296 position:50% align:center
[RIM]
Ahh!

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.633 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Oh, yeah! What
about my army of ants?

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
They went into hiding when
the dungeon changed shape,

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:00.345 position:50% align:center
but if they were around,

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:02.889 position:50% align:center
I could expand my
strategic options.

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:05.141 position:50% align:center
I just need some
source of power.

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:06.685 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Put a sock in it!

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:08.937 position:50% align:center
I can't think straight with you
two making all of that racket,

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.605 position:50% align:center
so get out of my apartment!

00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:12.607 position:50% align:center
You mean my apartment.

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:14.484 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Okay, but you know what is mine?

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.069 position:50% align:center
This!

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.946 position:50% align:center
Look, just because it stopped
working, does not make it a toy!

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:19.531 position:50% align:center
No! It's not yours!

00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:21.491 position:50% align:center
We both know you robbed
it from my village,

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:23.034 position:50% align:center
so technically it's mine!

00:12:23.118 --> 00:12:25.286 position:50% align:center
Hey! Quit making me
sound so bad!

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.997 position:50% align:center
[RANGA] And if you can't use it,
why do you want it?

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:31.251 position:50% align:center
A gun like this has other uses,
even if it doesn't work.

00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:33.837 position:50% align:center
I could sell it as an antique
and make some gold.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.130 position:50% align:center
So hands off.

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:37.340 position:50% align:center
The less banged up it is,
the higher it'll sell.

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:39.134 position:50% align:center
That understood?

00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:43.179 position:50% align:center
Come on, Rim! Did you not hear
a single word I just said?

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:45.056 position:50% align:center
[RIM gasps]

00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:55.525 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING] Required mana

Please stand by while reboot
process is initiated.

00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:01.740 position:50% align:center
Wait. What does it
mean by "reboot"?

00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:03.616 position:50% align:center
The heck is going on?

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.327 position:50% align:center
Like, I didn't even know
that it could talk!

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:07.954 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING]
Beginning bio-scan.

Compatibility for use confirmed.

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:21.885 position:50% align:center
This device is programmed
with one primary objective:

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:25.013 position:50% align:center
to protect the user during
dangerous situations.

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:26.765 position:50% align:center
In other words, I will destroy

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:30.685 position:50% align:center
any and all enemies
intending to do my user harm.

00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:32.729 position:50% align:center
Please verbally input
the password

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:34.981 position:50% align:center
to unlock security measures now.

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:37.025 position:50% align:center
It's got a password, huh?

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:40.779 position:50% align:center
Okay, let's try one,
two, three, four, five.

00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:42.197 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING]
Error.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.741 position:50% align:center
Who in their right mind
would make it that simplistic?

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:47.118 position:50% align:center
Literally anyone.
Where I'm from, it's common

00:13:47.202 --> 00:13:49.871 position:50% align:center
for passwords to consist
of consecutive numbers.

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:52.582 position:50% align:center
This is a long shot,
but... QWERTY?

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
What's "qwerty" mean?

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.419 position:50% align:center
Nothing. Just another one
of those passwords

00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:58.713 position:50% align:center
that's more about
convenience than security.

00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:01.966 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING] Security lock
opened. All systems go.

I owe the gods an apology.

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:20.485 position:50% align:center

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:22.987 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING] Confirmed.
Registration complete.

00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:25.115 position:50% align:center
Hello, master Ninomiya.

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:27.909 position:50% align:center
Humanoids are ideal users
for this device

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:32.080 position:50% align:center
since it will alleviate
all your combat needs.

00:14:32.163 --> 00:14:33.581 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Sorry, guys.

00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:37.752 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't have been so
quick to curse the divine.

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:39.462 position:50% align:center
I jumped the gun.

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:43.383 position:50% align:center
Turns out you are some
seriously generous providers!

00:14:50.473 --> 00:14:52.350 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Let's go over
the mission one last time

00:14:52.434 --> 00:14:55.353 position:50% align:center
just to make sure we're
all on the same page, okay?

00:14:55.437 --> 00:14:57.522 position:50% align:center
Take a look. Day one,

00:14:57.605 --> 00:15:00.316 position:50% align:center
we are to reach the staging
point on the third floor.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.445 position:50% align:center
Then day two is when
we'll stock up on supplies.

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:05.238 position:50% align:center
Day three,
we'll get to the point

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:06.740 position:50% align:center
just before the fourth floor.

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.241 position:50% align:center
And day four, we'll press on

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:10.410 position:50% align:center
until we reach the
monster-free zone.

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:11.911 position:50% align:center
Our top priority at the moment

00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:14.247 position:50% align:center
is to catch up with
Belza's pet adventurers,

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.833 position:50% align:center
AKA her most gullible flunkies.

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:18.710 position:50% align:center
I have it on good
authority those bozos

00:15:18.793 --> 00:15:19.919 position:50% align:center
are currently
caught up in dealing

00:15:20.003 --> 00:15:22.088 position:50% align:center
with the Gatekeeper
to the fifth floor.

00:15:22.172 --> 00:15:23.590 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
You're certain?

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:26.676 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Mm-hm. Apparently,
this monster is extra strong,

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.178 position:50% align:center
so they're stuck there for now.

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:29.763 position:50% align:center
But once the
reinforcements arrive,

00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:31.056 position:50% align:center
it's only a matter
of time before

00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:33.308 position:50% align:center
that roadblock's removed.

00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:35.769 position:50% align:center
They're sending
Raiza'ha's best, after all.

00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:38.271 position:50% align:center
[RIM] Sleepy. Want nap.
Or food. Or both.

00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:39.939 position:50% align:center
[WANIBE]
What's wrong?

00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:41.441 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Just thinking.

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:45.236 position:50% align:center
Belza might already be aware
of the ruins' existence.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.489 position:50% align:center
I figured that was the
general assumption already

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:48.740 position:50% align:center
since we're rushing
through to reach

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:50.617 position:50% align:center
their position
as quickly as we can.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.494 position:50% align:center
There would be a whole
lot more room for error

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:55.246 position:50% align:center
if we had a Shift Crystal,
but no such luck.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.665 position:50% align:center
Items are really
limited right now.

00:15:57.749 --> 00:16:00.585 position:50% align:center
Even the ones that are
essential to exploration.

00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:03.838 position:50% align:center
Tch. Damn. This company
demands tiptop results,

00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:05.548 position:50% align:center
so you'd think they'd
try a little harder

00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:07.384 position:50% align:center
to set us up for success.

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:09.386 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] Well, I suppose
I'll count my blessings

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:12.555 position:50% align:center
that we at least have
the bare minimum on hand.

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:14.307 position:50% align:center
This won't be easy, though.

00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:17.352 position:50% align:center
We could be the most experienced
veterans Raiza'ha has,

00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:18.770 position:50% align:center
and we'd still need scapegoats

00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:20.939 position:50% align:center
and grind tactics
to power through.

00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:23.233 position:50% align:center
I mean, I have what's
considered hero status,

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:26.486 position:50% align:center
yet I'm anticipating our mission
to be quite the endeavor.

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:28.905 position:50% align:center
We need to be doubly
sure in our abilities.

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:30.990 position:50% align:center
And I can't say that
I am about yours.

00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:33.910 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Heh. You worry way too much.

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:35.662 position:50% align:center
It's not like you're
my wife, you know.

00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:39.082 position:50% align:center
Wait, what? When did I
claim we were married?

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:41.209 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] Can I not be concerned
about your well-being

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:42.085 position:50% align:center
without having a
romantic motive?

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:44.713 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys? We've got company!

00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:45.588 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:48.008 position:50% align:center
[DOGS growl]

00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:49.968 position:50% align:center
Right. I'll take the vanguard!

00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:53.722 position:50% align:center
But I could use some support.
Wanibe and Ranga, back me up!

00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:54.973 position:50% align:center
Okie doke!

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:57.642 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] Rise and shine, Rim.
It's dinnertime!

00:16:57.726 --> 00:16:59.102 position:50% align:center
The best time!

00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:02.605 position:50% align:center
[SHIA] Above all else,
stay calm everyone!

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:03.857 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Wait a sec, Shia.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.692 position:50% align:center
Why? What am I waiting on?

00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:07.444 position:50% align:center
For me to do your job for you.

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:08.987 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:17.829 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:20.874 position:50% align:center
If I didn't know you were a gun,
I'd say you fit me like a glove.

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:22.500 position:50% align:center
Right, Runic Gun: Blade Wing?

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:25.795 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING] Hostile forces
successfully eliminated.

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:28.548 position:50% align:center
Nice to have an artifact
capable of absorbing mana

00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:30.342 position:50% align:center
and converting it into energy.

00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:33.219 position:50% align:center
This souped up baby's got
all the bells and whistles,

00:17:33.303 --> 00:17:36.723 position:50% align:center
including auto-aiming
and target-seeking!

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:38.266 position:50% align:center
Feels pretty darn good!

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.185 position:50% align:center
As if having great
brains wasn't enough,

00:17:40.268 --> 00:17:42.228 position:50% align:center
now I'm equipped with
great strength as well!

00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:43.897 position:50% align:center
Which means...

00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:47.776 position:50% align:center
I'm invincible!

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.572 position:50% align:center
[KRUTZ]
Well, what do we have here?

00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:54.324 position:50% align:center
I know it's only
the third floor,

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.326 position:50% align:center
but I feel like those
monsters shouldn't be

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:58.495 position:50% align:center
going down without
more of a fight.

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:00.163 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Awesome job, Blade Wing!

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:02.248 position:50% align:center
You're the best gun
ever, no contest!

00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:04.334 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING] Your compliments
are appreciated.

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:06.419 position:50% align:center
[KINJI laughs]
You're too much.

00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:09.214 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING] It's true this
device is arguably superior

00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:10.715 position:50% align:center
in terms of combat.

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:13.301 position:50% align:center
Then let's see just how
superior you can be!

00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:14.761 position:50% align:center
You can start by
helping me score

00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:16.346 position:50% align:center
a mountain of monster parts!

00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:18.098 position:50% align:center
I'll take these suckers
out and pay off

00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:20.934 position:50% align:center
all of my loans, easy as pie!

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:24.562 position:50% align:center
Eh?

00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:26.022 position:50% align:center
[clicking]

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:29.150 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Wha--! What gives?
Come on, work! Work, I said!

00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:31.653 position:50% align:center
Why aren't you doing
any of the gun stuff?

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:33.488 position:50% align:center
Does this thing know
how to play pranks, too?

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:34.823 position:50% align:center
It's smart enough.

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:38.326 position:50% align:center
So what's the problem, Ninomiya?
Technical issues?

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:40.620 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING]
Insufficient energy reserves.

00:18:40.704 --> 00:18:42.622 position:50% align:center
Dangerous situation detected.

00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:45.709 position:50% align:center
Activating emergency protocols.

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:48.086 position:50% align:center
Wait. What's the emergency?

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:51.715 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure, but based on
experiences from the past,

00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:54.801 position:50% align:center
I see this having
a very bad outcome.

00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:57.929 position:50% align:center
[chuckles nervously]
You 'n' me both.

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:03.852 position:50% align:center
[KINJI gasping]

00:19:03.935 --> 00:19:07.355 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING] Absorbing required
mana from surrounding area.

00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:09.733 position:50% align:center
Huh? No! All the
demonite we collected

00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:11.359 position:50% align:center
is getting sucked away!

00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:13.695 position:50% align:center
Light has no business
being this invasive!

00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:16.281 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It's weird.

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.326 position:50% align:center
Listen to the words of
your master and stop,

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:21.578 position:50% align:center
you infernal piece of junk!

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.455 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING]
I am not a piece junk.

00:19:23.538 --> 00:19:27.959 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] If you can't obey
my orders, you're outta here!

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:36.009 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING] I do not
appreciate being discarded.

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:39.054 position:50% align:center
Warning, whatever you do,
do not discard me!

00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:40.472 position:50% align:center
Do not dump me.

00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:42.140 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] It's like a jilted
girl who can't take a hint

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:44.768 position:50% align:center
and keeps coming back for more!

00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:47.937 position:50% align:center
[KINJI]
Wha--? Come on!

00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:50.565 position:50% align:center
Not even the mana in my clothes
is safe from this freak!

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:52.901 position:50% align:center
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:55.153 position:50% align:center
[SHIA]
Fix this, Mister Ninomiya!

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:57.572 position:50% align:center
You're making a mess
of everything!

00:19:57.655 --> 00:20:01.284 position:50% align:center
It got you all, too?

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:02.827 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:10.210 position:50% align:center
What in the world did you do?

00:20:10.293 --> 00:20:13.088 position:50% align:center
I made a mess of everything.

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:14.964 position:50% align:center
You jerk!

00:20:17.175 --> 00:20:19.260 position:50% align:center
[KRUTZ] I realize you saved
my hide in the past,

00:20:19.344 --> 00:20:21.888 position:50% align:center
but no amount of gratitude
can forgive what you've done!

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:24.766 position:50% align:center
Don't waste your breath on
apologies or excuses this time.

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:27.727 position:50% align:center
I will smack you again
if you play the sympathy card!

00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
Seriously, Mister Ninomiya.

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:31.314 position:50% align:center
It takes next to nothing
to get you riled up

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:34.317 position:50% align:center
and out of control!
Are you listening?

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:35.902 position:50% align:center
Okay, I get it.

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:37.696 position:50% align:center
If Wanibe has a
spare weapon on him,

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:39.030 position:50% align:center
then I'll just use that instead.

00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:40.699 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I do.

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:42.826 position:50% align:center
This friggin' hunk
of scrap metal...

00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:43.993 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't be surprised something

00:20:44.077 --> 00:20:46.329 position:50% align:center
that made me unbelievably
cool backfired.

00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:49.666 position:50% align:center
It isn't much, but it's
better than nothing.

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:51.876 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING] The ultimate
monster destroyer is

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.797 position:50% align:center
at your service. You have no
need for any other weapon.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.340 position:50% align:center
Damn this thing.

00:20:57.424 --> 00:20:58.925 position:50% align:center
You're gonna cost me
more than one fortune

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:00.760 position:50% align:center
if you keep sucking up
every ounce of mana around

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:03.722 position:50% align:center
when your battery gets
a little on the low side!

00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:06.099 position:50% align:center
My best bet is to wait until
you run out of energy

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:10.020 position:50% align:center
then pawn you off as a useless,
non-functioning replica firearm!

00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:11.688 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING]
If that's your true intent,

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:13.356 position:50% align:center
you leave me with no choice.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.275 position:50% align:center
[alarm blares]

00:21:15.358 --> 00:21:17.652 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING]
Ten. Nine. Eight.

00:21:17.736 --> 00:21:19.821 position:50% align:center
You're a gun you can't just
start counting down like that--

00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:21.114 position:50% align:center
what are you doing?

00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:22.657 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING] If this device
cannot be allowed

00:21:22.741 --> 00:21:24.576 position:50% align:center
to perform its
original function,

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:26.036 position:50% align:center
it will self-destruct.

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:27.620 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:21:27.704 --> 00:21:31.458 position:50% align:center
Not like I mind you blowing up,
but at least do it away from me!

00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:34.169 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING]
No. I don't want to be lonely.

00:21:34.252 --> 00:21:38.840 position:50% align:center
[screaming] This AI established
the worst identity possible!

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:41.676 position:50% align:center
Whoever decided to invent you
betrayed all of humanity!

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.927 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING]
Too lonely.

00:21:43.011 --> 00:21:47.098 position:50% align:center
Self-destruct together!
Self-destruct together!

00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:53.313 position:50% align:center
[KINJI sighs] You win.
Call off your countdown.

00:21:53.396 --> 00:21:55.899 position:50% align:center
I'll find some way to
put you to good use.

00:21:55.982 --> 00:21:57.317 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING]
Really?

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.902 position:50% align:center
Yes! Really!

00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:02.280 position:50% align:center
But that means neither
of us can explode, okay?

00:22:02.364 --> 00:22:05.158 position:50% align:center
[BLADE WING] Okay! This device
is the perfect weapon...

00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:07.911 position:50% align:center
It must be tough to be
in your position.

00:22:07.994 --> 00:22:09.079 position:50% align:center
Truly...

00:22:09.162 --> 00:22:10.747 position:50% align:center
[KINJI] Yeah, yeah.
You seriously sound

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.291 position:50% align:center
like a high-maintenance
girlfriend, though.
