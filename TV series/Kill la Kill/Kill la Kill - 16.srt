BUT WHEN RYUKO MET ME,

FIGHT SATSUKI AND HER

WHERE ALL THE CLUBS
HAD TO FIGHT EACH OTHER.

23

AND AT THE END OF THAT,
RYUKO HAD TO BATTLE
AGAINST THE ELITE FOUR.

SHE WAS THE PERSON
WITH THE SCISSOR BLADE

WHO KILLED RYUKO’S FATHER,

TURNS INTO A MONSTER.

TO COMPLETE HER CONQUEST
OF JAPAN’S SCHOOLS
