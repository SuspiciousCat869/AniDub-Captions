SO, YOU’RE
RAGYO KIRYUIN?

00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:37,163
JUST LIKE YOUR DAUGHTER ‐‐
A BIG SHOT WITH A BIG MOUTH.

474
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:38,665
HOW DROLL.

475
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:41,735
PERHAPS YOU DO NOT REALIZE
WHO YOU ARE TALKING TO.

476
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:45,972
I AM RAGYO KIRYUIN,

478
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:53,079
WHAT IS THE MEANING
OF THIS?

479
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,381
THE TIME FOR SPEECHES
IS OVER.

HEAR ME, DIRECTOR.

485
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:21,374
AS OF THIS MOMENT,
HONNOUJI ACADEMY AND I

486
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:23,877
ARE PUTTING AN END
TO YOUR REIGN.

NO, I’M NOT!

492
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:40,126
PEOPLE DO NOT LIVE
FOR THE SAKE OF CLOTHING.

493
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:44,831
I, SATSUKI KIRYUIN, AM RISING UP
TO OVERTHROW THE LIFE FIBERS.

494
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:48,368
I DID NOT CREATE
HONNOUJI ACADEMY FOR YOU,

00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:49,836
BUT TO DESTROY YOU.

REMEMBER THAT,
RAGYO KIRYUIN!

BUT WHO TUGS
ON THE THREAD OF DESTINY

00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:30,336
OF THESE GIRLS
WHO FIGHT IN LIVING CLOTHES?

500
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,839
AND AS THE LOOM OF FATE
SPINS THE FABRIC OF KARMA,

501
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:35,041
WHO IS THAT
SMILING IN THE SHADOWS?

502
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:38,812
NEXT TIME ON "KILL LA KILL,"
"INTO THE NIGHT."
