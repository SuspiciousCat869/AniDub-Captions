WE’RE GONNA FINISH THIS THING!

471
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:28,048
LET’S BAIL, MAKO!
OKAY!

472
00:22:33,554 --> 00:22:35,421
FORGIVE ME, MY LADY.

473
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:37,524
I UNDERESTIMATED HER.

474
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:39,292
DEMOTE HAKODATE TO NO STAR,

475
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:43,129
AND SET UP AN INTERLEAGUE MATCH
WITH THE SUMO CLUB FOR HOKKAIDO.

476
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:45,398
JUST AS I THOUGHT.

477
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:48,869
KAMUIS ARE QUITE POWERFUL.

478
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:51,938
YOU HAVE MY ATTENTION,
RYUKO MATOI.

479
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:26,567
Senketsu: SATSUKI KIRYUIN,

480
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:28,869
THE OWNER OF ANOTHER KAMUI.

481
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:33,106
AGAINST SUCH OVERWHELMING POWER,
RYUKO AND I ARE HELPLESS.

482
00:24:33,106 --> 00:24:35,008
CAN WE WIN, RYUKO?

483
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:38,879
NEXT TIME ON "KILL LA KILL,"
"JUNKETSU."
