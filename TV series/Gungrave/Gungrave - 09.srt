1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,633
( theme music playing )

2
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,300
- ( inaudible )

3
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,433
- Priest: SID GALARDE
HAS BEEN GRANTED

4
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,166
ETERNAL SALVATION,

5
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:51,466
AND RAISED ONTO HIS
HEAVENLY RESTING PLACE

6
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:55,300
WHERE HE IS FINALLY,
AND FOREVER MORE AT PEACE.

7
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:58,500
IN HEAVEN DEATH IS NOT
FEARED BUT WELCOMED,

8
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:01,733
FOR DEATH IS FORGIVENESS
AND REJUVENATION.

9
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,666
THE LORD IN HIS WISDOM...

10
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:06,300
- YOU MUST BE FEELING SAD,
AREN'T YOU SHERRY?

11
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:08,233
- MMM-MMM.

12
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,866
- NOW THAT HE'S PASSED AWAY
NO ONE WILL SAY ANYTHING

13
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:12,133
BAD ABOUT UNCLE SID.

14
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,833
BECAUSE NOBODY SPEAKS ILL OF
A PERSON WHOSE DIED.

15
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:19,033
- YOU'VE GOT REAL INNER
STRENGTH. I ADMIRE THAT.

16
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:26,700
- SHOULDN'T YOU GO THERE?
- I ALREADY SAID MY GOODBYES.

17
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:29,466
I TOLD HIM THE ONE THING HE
NEEDED TO HEAR BEFORE HE DIED,

18
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:31,700
THAT HE WOULDN'T BE
REMEMBERED AS A TRAITOR.

19
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:34,000
WHILE WE'RE ON THE
SUBJECT, BRANDON...

20
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,866
DON'T TAKE ON UNPLEASANT
CHORES SO WILLINGLY.

21
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,333
- ( crying )

22
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:44,766
- EDDIE!

23
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,266
- ( gunshot )

24
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,133
- YOU CAN RELAX A LITTLE
MORE. ALLOW YOURSELF

25
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,300
A LITTLE MORE FREEDOM.

26
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:56,700
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
BEING FREE FEELS LIKE.

27
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,233
- THERE'S A LOT YOU DON'T KNOW.

28
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,300
AND THAT CAN MAKE
THINGS A LITTLE AWKWARD.

29
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:06,366
YOU'RE JUST LIKE OUR BOSS,
BIG DADDY.

30
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,033
- Brandon: HARRY SAID, "LET'S
KEEP CLIMBING THE LADDER"

31
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,733
AND, "LET'S FORCE
THE CODE OF IRON."

32
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,066
I NODDED WITHOUT
SAYING A WORD.

33
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:26,766
BECAUSE THE ORGANIZATION,
MILLENION... YES.

34
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,733
IT'S MY WHOLE WORLD NOW.

35
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:50,066
- ITS GOOD TO FINALLY SEE
YOU AGAIN, BIG GUY.

36
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:54,633
- THAT GUY KILLED 327 MEN AND HE
GETS OUT AFTER ONLY EIGHT YEARS?

37
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,766
- QUIET! YOU NEVER KNOW
WHO'S LISTENING.

38
00:03:56,833 --> 00:04:00,200
SO UNLESS YOU'D WANT TO BE THE
328TH, I'D KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT.

39
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,300
- ALL RIGHT, I'VE WAITED LONG
ENOUGH. GIVE ME THAT THING.

40
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:12,033
- YOU GOT IT, BIG GUY.

41
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:18,900
- ( chuckles )

42
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,066
- THAT FEELS GOOD.

43
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:25,100
HI, PARTNER?

44
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,833
- SO, HOW'S THE BOSS?
- HE'S DOING JUST FINE.

45
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,900
THANKS TO YOU IT'S
BEEN SMOOTH SAILING,

46
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:33,700
SINCE YOU LEFT EIGHT YEARS AGO.

47
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:37,700
- GOOD, I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT.
I JUST HOPE I DON'T GET BORED.

48
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:39,466
- HEY BIG GUY.
- HUH?

49
00:05:07,866 --> 00:05:09,866
- DIDN'T WASTE ANY TIME,
DID YOU?

50
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:12,366
- BECAUSE I TOLD YOU,
I'D RETURN THIS...

51
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,833
JUST AS SOON AS YOU GOT BACK.

52
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,566
- YOU'RE A MAN THAT KEEPS
HIS WORD. RIGHT PAL?

53
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,533
THEY SAY CANNON VULCAN
IS FASTER THAN A BULLET.

54
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,566
YOU LIVE UPTO YOUR REPUTATION.

55
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:34,500
- BLOOD WAR. TURN THE WORLD
INTO A BATTLEFIELD.

56
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,333
- ANY BIG CHANGES
IN THE PAST EIGHT YEARS?

57
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,166
- YEAH. TOO MANY, ACTUALLY.

58
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:46,666
THE ORGANIZATION I BELONG
TO, THE LIGHTNING GROUP,

59
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:47,700
IS ON THE ROPES.

60
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:49,400
- BECAUSE OF MILLENNION?

61
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:51,966
- YEAH. THEY 'VE GAINED A
LOT OF GROUND.

62
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:55,566
THEY'RE PROMINENT PLAYERS NOW,
A REAL SOLID ORGANIZATION.

63
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:57,933
- THAT'S WHY YOU GUYS NEED
VOLCANO'S HELP?

64
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:00,733
- THAT'S RIGHT.

65
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,533
- LOOK, I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU.
BUT EVEN THOUGH WE'RE

66
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,966
SWORN BROTHERS,

67
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:07,633
MY BOSS WOULDN'T MOBILIZE
OUR GUYS FOR SOMETHING

68
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,966
THAT WOULDN'T MAKE US A PROFIT

69
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:10,666
OR GIVE US SOME
KIND OF ADVANTAGE.

70
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:16,033
- WHAT YOU GET WOULD BE A HUGE
ADVANTAGE AND A PROFIT.

71
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,333
COME WITH ME AND I'LL SHOW YOU.

72
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:32,500
- ARE YOU READY DOC?
- YES, WE'RE READY.

73
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:34,733
- THEN LET'S GET STARTED.
- ARE YOU SURE?

74
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,533
- I SAID LET'S GET STARTED!

75
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,066
- YES, SIR.

76
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:58,566
- WHAT IS THIS?
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

77
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:00,300
OPENING UP A PET STORE?

78
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:03,933
- YEAH. EXCEPT OUR PETS ARE
ANYTHING BUT TAME.

79
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,100
- IS IT ASLEEP?
- IT'S DEAD.

80
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,666
- HUH?
- WATCH IT CLOSELY.

81
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:11,200
DON'T TAKE YOUR EYES OFF IT.

82
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:12,500
DON'T EVEN BLINK.

83
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,766
THIS IS MY DREAM COME TRUE.

84
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:21,066
IT'S TAKEN ME SEVEN YEARS TO
TRANSFORM IT INTO A REALITY.

85
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:23,900
I GAVE UP EVERYTHING.
ALL MY MONEY,

86
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:26,900
MY FAMILY, EVERY FRIEND I HAD
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

87
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:45,166
- ( roars )

88
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,766
- WHAT THE HELL! WHAT IS THIS,
SOME KIND OF MAGIC TRICK?

89
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,066
- IT'S NOT MAGIC BUT WIZARDRY.

90
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:04,900
TECHNOLOGICAL WIZARDRY.
AND IF WE USED IT ON HUMANS?

91
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:07,700
IMAGINE AN ARMY OF CREATURES
WITH THAT KIND OF POWER.

92
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:11,800
OUR ARMY, UNDER OUR CONTROL.
NO MISSILES, GUNS.

93
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,900
NOTHING TO BUILD.

94
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:15,500
FINDING DEAD BODIES IS A
LOT EASIER.

95
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:18,133
WHEN IT IS PERFECTED, MILLENNION
WON'T STAND A CHANCE.

96
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:23,866
- ( maniacal laughter )

97
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:27,200
- I WAS BORED OUT OF MY MIND FOR
EIGHT YEARS BUT NOT ANYMORE!

98
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:31,133
AWESOME, CANNON! MY BLOOD'S
BOILING, I'M ON FIRE AGAIN!

99
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,600
AND NOW LET'S LIGHT THE
FIRES OF WAR!

100
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,800
- ( growling )

101
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,166
- I HEARD ABOUT THE SID INCIDENT
AND WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.

102
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:01,166
- I'M SORRY.
- DON'T BE.

103
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:03,833
- THESE ARE DIFFICULT TIMES,
BUT WE CAN ONLY HOPE THE WORLD

104
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,500
WILL BE MORE
HARMONIOUS SOMEDAY.

105
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,000
-HARRY AND I WILL CREATE
THAT WORLD, SIR.

106
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,766
- OH, YOU WILL?

107
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,333
- I'VE HEARD THAT YOU
HAVEN'T SEEN MARIA LATELY.

108
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,666
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- AND WHY IS THAT?

109
00:09:24,766 --> 00:09:27,600
YOU ARE AN AWKWARD GUY, BRANDON.
YOU KNOW THAT?

110
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,400
- SOMEONE SAID I WAS AWKWARD.

111
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:31,733
AS YOU ARE.

112
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:38,333
- AS I AM? WHOEVER IT WAS MUST
HAVE MEANT IT AS A COMPLIMENT.

113
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:40,033
( laughs )

114
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,566
- NICE!
- ALL RIGHT.

115
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:50,666
- ( APPLAUSE )

116
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:52,566
- YOU WOULDN'T HAVE SUNK
THAT EIGHT YEARS AGO.

117
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:56,400
- HUH! BLOOD WAR!
WELL, I'LL BE...

118
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:58,766
- WELCOME BACK BLOOD.
- BOSS.

119
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:00,833
- SO, HOW'RE YOU DOING?

120
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,666
- GREAT. THANKS TO YOU,
EVERYTHING IS GOING JUST FINE.

121
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:05,200
A FULL FLEDGED CIVILIAN AGAIN.

122
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:09,400
- STOP BEING POLITE, WILL YOU?
HEY, NO MORE GOLF TODAY.

123
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:10,566
- Girl: YES SIR.

124
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:13,333
- SO WHAT'LL IT BE? YOU
NAME IT. BOOZE, WOMEN,

125
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,266
TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT,
I'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN.

126
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:21,866
- THE ONLY THING I WANT IS OUT.

127
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:24,966
I WANT YOU TO LET ME
AND MY GUYS LEAVE VOLCANO.

128
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:26,466
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

129
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:32,066
- I FOUND IT, BOSS.
I FOUND MY BATTLEFIELD.

130
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,233
- JOIN LIGHTNING? ARE YOU
SURE ABOUT THIS, BIG GUY?

131
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,866
- I'M SURE. MY BRO IN LIGHTNING
IS DEVELOPING A NEW PROCESS.

132
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,800
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
TOTALLY AWESOME.

133
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:45,733
THE MOST AMAZING
THING I'VE EVER SEEN.

134
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
- I GUARANTEE IT WILL
BLOW YOUR MIND.

135
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:48,600
- Man: THAT'S AWESOME.

136
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,533
I'M WITH YOU ALL
THE WAY, BIG GUY.

137
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,166
I'VE BEEN ITCHING FOR
A FIGHT FOR EIGHT YEARS.

138
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:55,166
I'M READY TO GO WHENEVER
YOU SAY.

139
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:57,833
- ME, TOO. MY LIFE'S BEEN
IN YOUR HANDS EVER SINCE

140
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,300
I PLEDGED MY LOYALTY,
AND IT STILL IS.

141
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:02,766
- LIGHTNING IS IN MILLENNION'S
SPHERE OF INFLUENCE.

142
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,433
IF THEY FIND OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON,

143
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,300
LIGHTNING COULD BE WIPED OUT.

144
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:07,733
AND US RIGHT ALONG WITH THEM!

145
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:15,466
UH...

146
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:18,000
- GO AHEAD.

147
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:20,200
- WHAT? BIG GUY?

148
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:22,633
- COME ON, YOU SPINELESS COWARD.
WHY DON'T YOU STOP WHINING

149
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,566
AND SHOOT ME? HUH?

150
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:26,833
- HOLD ON. PLEASE,
LET ME EXPLAIN.

151
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,466
- BIG GUY, HIS WIFE JUST HAD A
LITTLE BOY, COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.

152
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:33,433
- HEY! SHUT UP.
- I SEE.

153
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:37,666
HIS PAPA'S GOT NO BALLS.

154
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:52,666
- I'M WILLING TO RISK MY LIFE
TO FOLLOW THE BIG GUY. ARE YOU?

155
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:55,400
-I'M WITH YOU, BIG GUY.
I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU TELL ME.

156
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,466
- IT WON'T BE BORING.
THAT'S FOR SURE.

157
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:59,566
- YOU GOT THAT RIGHT,
BROTHER. THINGS NEVER

158
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:01,233
ARE WHEN BIG GUY IS AROUND.

159
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,500
- ( all laugh )

160
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,966
- GET READY TO MOVE!
- All: YES, SIR!

161
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:23,433
- I CAN SMELL THE
BATTLEFIELD, EAST.

162
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:31,333
- ( gunshots )

163
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,766
- BRANDON, SO, WHAT
DO YOU THINK?

164
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,033
- ARE ANY OF THEM GOOD ENOUGH?
- THREE OF THEM,

165
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,166
IF WE TRAIN THEM RIGHT.

166
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:48,533
- GOOD. TAKE THE ONES YOU
WANT UNDER YOUR WING.

167
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,566
- I'LL LEAVE THEIR
TRAINING UP TO YOU.

168
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:51,266
- SURE.

169
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,033
- WE'LL COMBINE OUR TWO UNITS.

170
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,700
THE GUYS FROM OVERKILL
AND TRUE GRAVE.

171
00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:57,000
TOGETHER THEY WILL BECOME

172
00:12:57,066 --> 00:12:59,633
MILLENNION'S MOST
POWERFUL WEAPON.

173
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:04,100
- SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
SIR. THEY JUST CALLED

174
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,533
AN EXECUTIVE MEETING.

175
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
- YES, ALL RIGHT.

176
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:11,100
- I APOLOGIZE TO YOU
ALL FOR MAKING YOU

177
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,400
COME ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

178
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:14,600
YOU SEE, I HAVE JUST
RECEIVED A TIP.

179
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,933
THAT SOME OF LIGHTNING'S

180
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,900
ACTIVITIES APPEAR
HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS.

181
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:19,366
- LIGHTNING, YOU SAY?

182
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:21,366
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION
THAT THE DAMAGE

183
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,566
WE INFLICTED ON THEM

184
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:24,900
FOUR YEARS AGO WOULD PREVENT
THEM FROM BECOMING A THREAT.

185
00:13:24,966 --> 00:13:27,100
- ITS TRUE. THEY'RE A
TWO-BIT OUTFIT WHO

186
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,333
ARE BARELY MANAGING TO SURVIVE.

187
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,933
HARDLY WORTH
OUR ATTENTION.

188
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,200
- IT MAY WELL BE
A MINOR ISSUE.

189
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:36,066
HOWEVER, IF WHATEVER LIGHTNING'S
DOING INVOLVES SOMEONE

190
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:38,033
FROM THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE MOUNTAIN.

191
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,000
- MEANING? VOLCANO RIGHT?

192
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:43,133
- BUT WHY? BIG DADDY
AND VOLCANO

193
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,366
HAVE A VERY FRIENDLY
RELATIONSHIP.

194
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:48,533
- THEY AGREED TO A
NON-AGGRESSION PACT A WHILE AGO.

195
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,933
- CORRECT. HOWEVER, ONE OF THE
MEMBERS DISASSOCIATED HIMSELF

196
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,600
FROM THE VOLCANO FAMILY
ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

197
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,600
I'M SURE YOU ALL HAVE
HEARD OF HIM.

198
00:13:58,766 --> 00:14:01,466
THE NAME OF THIS MAN IS WAR.
BLOOD WAR.

199
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:02,600
- AH, BLOOD WAR...

200
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:05,833
KNOWN AS BLOOD
OF THE BATTLEFIELD.

201
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,766
- VOLCANO'S A GOOD OUTFIT AND HE
WAS ONE OF THEIR TOP GUYS.

202
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,966
WHY WOULD HE GIVE THAT UP
TO JOIN LIGHTNING?

203
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:15,000
- WHAT THE HELL IS HE UP TO?
- SORRY, THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

204
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:17,133
- ALLOW US TO TAKE
CARE OF IT, SIR.

205
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,666
YOU CAN COUNT ON HARRY MACDOWEL
AND MY PARTNER BRANDON HEAT,

206
00:14:20,733 --> 00:14:21,933
TO DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

207
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,933
- WHAT'S THAT?
- YOU TWO JUST

208
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,500
JOINED THE FAMILY.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK...

209
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:28,833
- I'M IN FAVOR OF IT.
- BEAR WALKEN?

210
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,500
- I BELIEVE THAT THE TWO OF
THEM'D BE THE BEST MEN

211
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:33,300
FOR THIS JOB.

212
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:35,266
- AM I RIGHT?
- YES.

213
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,100
- I HOPE SO. BUT LET ME
TELL YOU ONE THING.

214
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,300
IF YOU UNDERESTIMATE
BLOOD WAR...

215
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:47,066
IT'LL BE THE LAST MISTAKE YOU
WILL EVER MAKE.

216
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,800
- I SEE. SO, YOU'RE SAYING
THAT THE VOLCANO FAMILY

217
00:14:54,866 --> 00:14:56,000
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

218
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:58,200
- NOTHING AT ALL?
- OF COURSE NOT.

219
00:14:58,266 --> 00:14:59,600
ONCE A GUY LEAVES
THE FAMILY

220
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,800
WHAT HE DOES IS NONE
OF MY BUSINESS.

221
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:04,366
- I AM NOT LOOKING FOR
ATTITUDE, BUT HARMONY.

222
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:07,566
- YEAH, SO AM I.
- WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP HIM?

223
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:10,466
- THERE ARE GUYS IN THIS WORLD
THAT REFUSE TO PLAY BY ANYONE'S

224
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:12,100
RULES BUT THEIR OWN.

225
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:15,800
- I SEE. AT ANY RATE, I'LL HAVE
TO DO ANYTHING THAT'S NECESSARY

226
00:15:15,866 --> 00:15:17,333
TO PROTECT MY ORGANIZATION.

227
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,800
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?

228
00:15:18,866 --> 00:15:20,333
- I THINK IF I COULD JUST...

229
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,733
NO, NEVER MIND.

230
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:26,400
- I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

231
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:29,900
- BUT YOU KNOW.
- YEAH, I GOT IT.

232
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,100
- IT'S AGREED THEN. BLOOD WAR
AND HIS 23 UNDERLINGS...

233
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,766
WILL JOIN UP WITH
CANNON VULCAN.

234
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:56,100
THERE AREN'T VERY MANY OF THEM,
BUT I HANDPICKED EACH ONE.

235
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,800
USE THEM AS YOU LIKE.

236
00:15:57,866 --> 00:15:59,933
- THEY'LL BE WELL
TAKEN CARE OF.

237
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,533
I'LL DO WHATEVER I
CAN FOR MY GUESTS.

238
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,400
- THAT'S REAL NICE OF YOU.
SMART, TOO.

239
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:07,600
LOT OF THOSE GUYS
HAVE A SHORT FUSE.

240
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,866
- YEAH. JUST LIKE YOU, BIG GUY.

241
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:14,133
- LOOK WHO'S TALKING. BY THE
WAY HOW'S YOUR BOSS?

242
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,366
- HE DIED TWO WEEKS AGO.
I GAVE HIM A NICE FUNERAL.

243
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:19,166
I TOOK OVER THE ORGANIZATION.

244
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,033
- ( chuckles )

245
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,466
- SO YOU KILLED HIM, HUH?

246
00:16:25,866 --> 00:16:29,133
ISN'T THAT NICE. NOW WE HAVE
NO MORE ROADBLOCKS.

247
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:31,300
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

248
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,700
- CAN'T TELL YOU YET.
- WHY NOT?

249
00:16:35,766 --> 00:16:37,766
- EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN.

250
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,500
- WHAT'S UP? WE DIDN'T
ORDER ANYTHING!

251
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,366
- WELL, A GUEST SENT THEM
WITH HIS COMPLIMENTS.

252
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:45,800
- I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
IF I JOIN YOU?

253
00:16:45,866 --> 00:16:47,133
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU, PAL?

254
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,966
- OF COURSE, YOU'RE MORE THAN
WELCOME TO JOIN US.

255
00:16:50,033 --> 00:16:53,100
WHAT A NICE DELIGHTFUL SURPRISE
RUNNING INTO YOU LIKE THIS,

256
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,566
HARRY MACDOWEL OF MILLENNION.

257
00:16:55,633 --> 00:16:56,733
- FROM MILLENNION?

258
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:03,400
- I MUST SAY THAT I CONSIDER IT
AN HONOR YOU REMEMBERED MY NAME.

259
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:06,966
I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT TO
CELEBRATE, SO I PROPOSE A TOAST.

260
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:10,533
TO CANNON VULCAN FOR TAKING OVER
THE LEADERSHIP OF LIGHTNING.

261
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,533
AND TO BLOOD WAR FOR BEING
RELEASED FROM PRISON

262
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,266
AFTER EIGHT YEARS.

263
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,466
- HOW NICE.
-THINK YOU'RE CLEVER, DON'T YOU?

264
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:22,100
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

265
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,600
IT TASTES LIKE PIG PISS FROM
A BIG FAT PIG.

266
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,633
WHO BELONGS TO A BIG,
FAT ORGANIZATION!

267
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,100
- I ASKED THE GUY AT THE BAR TO
MAKE IT EXTRA STRONG.

268
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,966
- NOT STRONG ENOUGH,
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

269
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:37,033
- TELL ME, WHAT BRINGS ONE
OF MILLENNION'S EXECUTIVES

270
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,866
TO A PLACE LIKE THIS?

271
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,133
- IF FLIES WERE BUZZING
AROUND YOUR FACE,

272
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,833
WOULDN'T IT BOTHER YOU A BIT?

273
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,600
- YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE FLIES?
- YES.

274
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:49,366
- SO WHY'D MILLENNION TAKE
NOTICE OF MERE INSECTS LIKE US?

275
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:52,600
- FUNNY, ISN'T IT?
EVEN COMICAL, I SUPPOSE.

276
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,366
BUT WHEN FLIES START BUZZING
AROUND, WE WONDER.

277
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:58,800
THERE'S GOT TO BE A REASON. BUT
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND IT.

278
00:17:58,866 --> 00:18:00,466
THAT GOT OUR ATTENTION.

279
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:02,866
- YOU HAVEN'T FOUND IT
BECAUSE IT ISN'T THERE.

280
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:04,500
- THAT'S RATHER HARD TO BELIEVE.

281
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:06,366
IF IT WERE TRUE, YOU'D
HAVE HAD NO REASON

282
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:08,000
TO KILL YOUR FORMER BOSS.

283
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:12,400
- YOU'RE SAYING I KILLED HIM?
- IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?

284
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,666
- HOW DARE YOU ACCUSE HIM
WITHOUT ANY PROOF? YOU BASTARD!

285
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:17,433
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

286
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:26,333
- HEY, THE GUY AT THE BAR,
IS HE A BUDDY OF YOURS?

287
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,533
- YES. HIS NAME IS BRANDON,
BRANDON HEAT.

288
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,666
- HE'S OUR SWEEPER...
VERY GOOD AT HIS JOB.

289
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,700
- IF WE'D STARTED SHOOTING,
WE'D HAVE KILLED EACH OTHER,

290
00:18:43,766 --> 00:18:45,033
BRANDON HEAT.

291
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:49,866
- THAT'S A REAL SCARY GUY
YOU GOT THERE.

292
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:52,300
- HE'S RATHER DEPENDABLE, TOO.

293
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:54,633
- NOW THEN, YOU'RE READY
TO START EXPLAINING

294
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,700
WHAT YOU'RE UP TO?

295
00:18:55,766 --> 00:18:58,200
YOU'VE BEEN RECRUITING A
LOT OF MANPOWER LATELY.

296
00:18:58,266 --> 00:19:00,300
WHAT'S LIGHTNING GOING
TO USE THEM FOR?

297
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:01,800
- WE'RE A SMALL OUTFIT.

298
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:06,000
WE JUST NEEDED SOME EXTRA
HELP, THAT'S ALL.

299
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:10,033
- SURE, I UNDERSTAND.
AND I BELIEVE YOU, TOO.

300
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,900
BECAUSE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS
DEPEND ON TRUSTING ONE ANOTHER.

301
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:17,833
UNFORTUNATELY I'M A HOPELESSLY
SKEPTICAL KIND OF GUY.

302
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,933
SO I'VE GOT VERY FEW FRIENDS.

303
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:40,966
- I DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE UNDER
HARRY MACDOWEL'S MICROSCOPE.

304
00:19:41,033 --> 00:19:42,800
THIS COULD GET REAL TRICKY.

305
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:45,766
- NO, CANNON. THE TRICKY
ONE IS THE OTHER GUY

306
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,633
WHO WAS HAVING A
DRINK OVER HERE.

307
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,666
THAT GUY WHO HE CALLED
BRANDON HEAT.

308
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,066
SOMETHING ABOUT HIM.

309
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:54,333
HE HAD ME IN HIS SIGHTS
AND I NEVER KNEW

310
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,133
HE WAS IN THE ROOM.

311
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,400
IF YOU'RE NOT SCARED OF
THIS GUY, YOU SHOULD BE.

312
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:01,666
- I'M NOT WORRIED.
I'VE GOT YOU, DON'T I?

313
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,066
- YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

314
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,166
ONE THING'S FOR SURE.

315
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:11,166
IT'S GOING TO BE A HELL
OF A BATTLEFIELD!

316
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:13,933
- SO, CANNON VULCAN
AND BLOOD WAR...

317
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,200
THAT'S GONNA BE TOUGH BUT
WE'LL PULL IT OFF.

318
00:20:16,266 --> 00:20:19,566
WE'VE GOT TO. WE CAN'T
AFFORD TO BOTCH THIS JOB.

319
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:22,700
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING.
AND THEN THE SKY'S THE LIMIT.

320
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,033
- BLOOD WAR?
I'VE HEARD RUMORS ABOUT HIM.

321
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,033
I'VE HEARD THAT HE WAS IN CHARGE
OF VOLCANO ORGANIZATION'S

322
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,466
SPECIAL COMBAT UNIT.

323
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:36,966
AND THAT BEFORE
HE WENT TO PRISON,

324
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:39,100
HE KILLED OVER 200 PEOPLE.

325
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,500
LISTEN, BRO, IF YOU
FIGHT THIS DUDE,

326
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:43,900
A WHOLE LOT OF GUYS,
HUNDREDS OF THEM

327
00:20:43,966 --> 00:20:45,866
ARE GOING TO END UP
IN POOLS OF BLOOD.

328
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,633
YOU HAVE TO PREPARE YOURSELF
TO DEAL WITH THAT.

329
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,300
- I UNDERSTAND.

330
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:54,666
- WHAT'S THAT?
- NOTHING.

331
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,700
HARRY, DON'T DIE, OKAY?

332
00:21:02,766 --> 00:21:03,833
- RIGHT BACK AT YOU, PAL.

333
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,166
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

334
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,433
TELL ME WHO YOU
GUYS ARE LOYAL TO?

335
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,266
- All: WE'RE LOYAL TO BLOOD WAR!

336
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:22,366
- YEAH THAT'S RIGHT. AND DO YOU
ALL BELIEVE IN BLOOD WAR?

337
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:23,333
- All: YES, SIR!

338
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,233
- DO YOU SWEAR, YOU'LL
SACRIFICE EVERYTHING

339
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:26,966
FOR BLOOD WAR?

340
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:28,033
- All: YES, SIR!

341
00:21:34,966 --> 00:21:37,233
- I, BLOOD WAR,

342
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,166
AM GOING TO TAKE CONTROL
OF YOUR HEARTS AND SOULS.

343
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,166
- ( gun fires )

344
00:21:44,266 --> 00:21:47,133
- ( men screaming )

345
00:22:06,766 --> 00:22:10,000
- ( maniacal laughter )

346
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,566
- THE WAR IS ABOUT TO START!

347
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:20,333
WAIT FOR US, MILLENNION!
WAIT FOR US, BRANDON HEAT!

348
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,366
-I'VE JOINED FORCES
WITH BLOOD WAR.

349
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:31,033
- IF YOU TRULY UNDERSTAND WHAT
THAT MEANS FOR THE FUTURE,

350
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,033
YOU CAN CHOOSE ONLY ONE PATH.

351
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,700
- ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

352
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,466
BALLADBIRD LEE.

353
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:41,600
- CANNON VULCAN...

354
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,833
- ( pop song playing )

355
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,066
- ( man singing )

356
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,300
- Brandon: BLOOD WAR
AND CANNON VULCAN

357
00:24:17,366 --> 00:24:20,233
WILL TURNED THIS CITY
INTO A WARZONE.

358
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,366
THEY'LL TRY TO DESTROY
EVERYTHING IN SIGHT

359
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:24,933
WHICH MILLENION
CAN'T ALLOW.

360
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
WHICH BRANDON HEAT WILL
NOT ALLOW.
