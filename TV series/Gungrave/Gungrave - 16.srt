1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,966
( theme music playing )

2
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:52,833
I KEEP WONDERING
OVER AND OVER AGAIN...

3
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,333
IF I MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE.
RIGHT OR WRONG...

4
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,533
I KNEW I WOULD GO TO HELL
FOR WHAT I'VE DONE.

5
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,666
AND I ACCEPT THAT.

6
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:07,266
BUT I WONDER IS IT NECESSARY
TO MAKE YOU COME WITH ME...

7
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,333
EVEN IF THAT IS WHAT
YOU WISHED FOR.

8
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:34,333
- WHAT A CATASTROPHE.
SO, HOW MANY DID WE LOSE?

9
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,566
- FOUR RESEARCHERS ARE DEAD.

10
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,800
FIVE OTHERS AND
DR. TOKIOKA ARE MISSING.

11
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,433
NO DOUBT, BURIED IN THE RUBBLE.

12
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,533
- THE THREE NECROLYZERS
WERE BLOWN OUT OF EXISTENCE.

13
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,733
OF COURSE, BY THEN, THEY HAD
ALREADY TRASHED THE LAB.

14
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,166
- BOSS, DO YOU REALLY THINK
THIS WAS AN ACCIDENT,

15
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:50,800
OR SOMETHING ELSE?

16
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:52,766
- IT DOESN'T MATTER, DOES IT?

17
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:57,566
EITHER WAY, YOUR EXPECTATIONS
WERE REALISTIC TO BEGIN WITH.

18
00:02:57,633 --> 00:02:58,766
- AND WHO ARE YOU?

19
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,666
- A RESEARCHER
WITH THE R&amp;D TEAM,

20
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:03,200
MY NAME IS LAGUNA GLOCK.

21
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,966
- WHY DID YOU SAY OUR
EXPECTATIONS WEREN'T REALISTIC?

22
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:07,666
- DR. TOKIOKA WAS STUDYING

23
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:09,666
A PROCESS CALLED
NECROLYZATION...

24
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:11,266
HE CLAIMED HE WAS PERFECTING

25
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,233
A METHOD OF
REANIMATING THE DEAD.

26
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,800
BUT AFTER THOROUGHLY REVIEWING

27
00:03:14,866 --> 00:03:16,733
THE PARAMETERS OF
HIS EXPERIMENTS,

28
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,000
I DISCOVERED THE PROCESS
WAS MORE EFFECTIVE

29
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:22,233
ON PEOPLE STILL ALIVE
RATHER THAN THOSE WHO WERE DEAD.

30
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,466
MEANING, THAT THE DOCTOR
INTENTIONALLY MADE THE PROCESS

31
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:27,833
MORE DIFFICULT
THAN IT HAD TO BE.

32
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,466
SIR, IF YOU PUT ME
IN CHARGE OF THIS PROJECT,

33
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:36,000
I PROMISE TO DEVELOP THE MOST
ADVANCED NECROLYZERS EVER SEEN

34
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:37,966
...AND BETTER YET,

35
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:41,433
A COMPLETELY NEW KIND OF
SOLDIER FOR MILLENNION.

36
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:46,233
- ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GIVE IT A TRY.

37
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,466
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH
YOU HAVE TO SPEND.

38
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:51,833
JUST GET ME RESULTS AS QUICKLY
AS POSSIBLE. UNDERSTAND?

39
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,866
- PERFECTLY. THANK YOU, SIR.

40
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:01,333
- BOSS, ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

41
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,900
- YEAH, LEE.
I CAN SEE IT IN HIS EYES.

42
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,533
- HIS EYES, BOSS?

43
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,400
- HE HAS THE EYES OF A MAN WHO
WOULD SELL HIS SOUL TO SATAN

44
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:12,600
TO FIND THE ANSWERS
HE'S LOOKING FOR.

45
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,966
( he exclaims )

46
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,933
- I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
FOR 15 YEARS.

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,666
- PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

48
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:52,066
- THE MONEY YOU ASKED ME TO GET
FOR YOU IS IN THE TRUNK.

49
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:53,366
- THANK YOU.

50
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,900
- WHAT NOW?
ARE YOU LEAVING TOWN?

51
00:04:57,966 --> 00:04:59,600
- AS SOON AS I CAN.

52
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,233
FIRST I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO DELIVER TWO THINGS.

53
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,100
THIS CASE AND A LETTER.

54
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,800
THERE'S A MAN I NEED TO
GET THEM TO RIGHT AWAY.

55
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:10,066
BIG DADDY HIMSELF,
THE BOSS OF MILLENNION.

56
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:12,200
- YOU MEAN MY MASTER?

57
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:14,200
- BROTHER, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

58
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:17,100
- YOU SAID YOU HAVE
A LETTER FOR MY MASTER?

59
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,966
- DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME
YOU WORK FOR...

60
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,600
( crickets chirping )

61
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,200
- "DEAR BIG DADDY,"

62
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:31,166
"THE FACT THAT YOU ARE
READING THIS LETTER

63
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:35,500
MEANS THAT I NO LONGER
EXIST IN THIS WORLD."

64
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:40,300
"BUT THAT IS PART
OF MY DESTINY TOO.

65
00:05:40,366 --> 00:05:43,366
ALONG WITH WHAT I CONFESS
TO YOU NOW IN THIS LETTER."

66
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:47,900
"I KNEW ALL ABOUT WHAT
MY FRIEND, HARRY MACDOWEL,

67
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:51,500
WAS DOING. I KNEW EVERYTHING."

68
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:53,633
"I KNEW HE WAS
WORKING FROM BEHIND THE SCENES

69
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,900
TO STRENGTHEN HIS TEAM..."

70
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:58,533
"...AND GET PROMOTED
MORE QUICKLY."

71
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,533
"I KNEW THAT HE WAS
PAYROLLING RESEARCH

72
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,233
AIMED AT REVIVING THE DEAD."

73
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,866
"AND THROUGH IT ALL,
I REMAINED SILENT.

74
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:08,800
I DIDN'T TELL YOU WHAT I KNEW."

75
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:10,700
"I HAD A REASONS."

76
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:12,633
"IT WAS EASY TO JUSTIFY."

77
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,800
"I TOLD MYSELF,

78
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:16,300
IF WHAT HARRY IS DOING WILL
BENEFIT THE ORGANIZATION,

79
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:18,000
"THEN IT MUST BE ALL RIGHT."

80
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:20,733
"I WANTED TO BELIEVE
IN HARRY MACDOWEL.

81
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,900
I WANTED TO BELIEVE
IN MY BEST FRIEND."

82
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:28,766
- BRANDON...

83
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,566
I PROMISE YOU THIS.

84
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:34,100
IF HARRY MACDOWEL DOES ANY
DAMAGE TO THIS ORGANIZATION...

85
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,900
- HARRY'S NOT A TRAITOR
AND HE NEVER WILL BE.

86
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:38,466
YOU'VE GOT MY WORD.

87
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:41,733
HOWEVER, EACH AND EVERY TRAITOR
WHO BREAKS THE CODE OF IRON

88
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,766
WILL RECEIVE
THE SAME PUNISHMENT.

89
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:47,166
NO MORE, NO LESS,
REGARDLESS OF RANK OR STATUS.

90
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:50,500
( loads gun )

91
00:06:50,566 --> 00:06:54,933
- SO YOU ALREADY KNOW.
EVEN BACK THEN, YOU KNEW.

92
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,166
BUT TO BE PREPARED TO FACE
A THING LIKE THAT...

93
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:05,900
- NOT HARRY. OF COURSE NOT.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

94
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:10,666
BUT WHY?... WHY, BRANDON?
PLEASE TELL ME.

95
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,933
( he exclaims )

96
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,466
- BRANDON...

97
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:27,433
I KNOW YOU WANTED TO
PROTECT THE ORGANIZATION.

98
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,533
AND MARIA AS WELL...

99
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,433
- "BIG DADDY. I WANT TO BELIEVE
IN HARRY MACDOWEL."

100
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,133
"BUT IF HE FORGETS HIMSELF,
IF HE VEERS OFF COURSE,

101
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,066
HE'LL NEED TO BE STOPPED."

102
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:44,433
"AND THAT WILL BE MY JOB.
NO ONE ELSE'S."

103
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,900
"THAT'S WHY I MET WITH
DR. TOKIOKA SECRETLY

104
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:51,166
AND WHY HE GRANTED MY REQUEST."

105
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:54,600
"IN THE EVENT OF MY DEATH,
I WANT TO BE REVIVED.

106
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,533
TO BECOME A NECROLYZER."

107
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,233
"I WANT TO REMAIN IN THE
CONTAINMENT CHAMBER ASLEEP

108
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,133
UNTIL I'M NEEDED."

109
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,266
"IF THE ORGANIZATION
IS THREATENED,

110
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,633
OR IF HARRY VEERS OFF COURSE,"

111
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,566
"I WANT TO BE AWAKENED."

112
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:10,000
- BRANDON, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

113
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,766
BRANDON...

114
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,666
BRANDON, YOU'RE SO AWKWARD.

115
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:34,666
YOU WERE FREE TO MAKE YOUR LIFE
WHATEVER YOU WANTED IT TO BE.

116
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:36,800
WHY DID YOU
THROW ALL THAT AWAY?

117
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,400
IT'S ALL RIGHT, BRANDON.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

118
00:09:45,466 --> 00:09:47,866
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WAKE UP EVER AGAIN.

119
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:50,466
JUST REST PEACEFULLY.

120
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:53,366
THAT'S THE ONLY THING
I CAN WISH FOR NOW.

121
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:55,100
REST, MY SON.

122
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,233
( he sobs )

123
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,833
- DR. TOKIOKA, I WON'T ASK
WHAT KIND OF EXPERIMENTS

124
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,733
YOU WERE CONDUCTING...

125
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,166
WHEN YOU CONSPIRED
WITH HARRY MACDOWEL.

126
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:11,166
OR WHAT SORT OF IMMORAL ACTS
YOU COMMITTED IN DOING SO.

127
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:13,833
WHAT I EXPECT IN RETURN

128
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,566
IS YOUR PROMISE TO LET
BRANDON REST IN PEACE FOREVER.

129
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:20,466
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU NEED
AND YOU'LL GET IT.

130
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,566
THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
IS THAT CLEAR?

131
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,533
- YES, BIG DADDY.
PERFECTLY CLEAR.

132
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,100
( he screams )

133
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,500
( loud thud )

134
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,733
- THAT WILL BE ALL NOW, DOCTOR.

135
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:43,500
( he grimaces )

136
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,600
( he chuckles )

137
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,866
- NOT NEARLY AS MUCH
PAIN AS I DESERVE

138
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,566
FOR THE THINGS I'VE DONE.

139
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:05,133
- WHAT AM I PUNISHING HIM FOR?

140
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,600
I'M THE ONE WHO DESERVES
TO BE CONDEMNED.

141
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:13,333
- MASTER, I JUST RECEIVED
A RATHER URGENT CALL

142
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,800
FROM THE MANSION.

143
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:16,000
- WHAT HAPPENED?

144
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:18,900
- I'M AFRAID THAT MADAM MARIA
CAN'T BE FOUND, SIR.

145
00:11:18,966 --> 00:11:20,033
- WHAT WAS THAT?

146
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,433
- THEY'VE SEARCHED THE ENTIRE
ESTATE QUITE THOROUGHLY

147
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,700
AND COULDN'T FIND HER.

148
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,966
- LET'S GET GOING.

149
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,966
- BRANDON AND HARRY WERE
IN THE ORGANIZATION.

150
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:38,200
HARRY KILLED BRANDON

151
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:41,700
BECAUSE BRANDON BETRAYED
THE ORGANIZATION?

152
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:47,000
IT'S ABSURD!
HOW COULD HE?

153
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:51,300
THE TWO OF THEM WERE SO CLOSE...
IT JUST ISN'T POSSIBLE.

154
00:11:51,366 --> 00:11:56,400
BUT IF IT'S TRUE, I'LL NEVER
FORGIVE HARRY MACDOWEL...

155
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,000
FOR KILLING MY BELOVED BRANDON.

156
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:40,566
- I THOUGHT I MIGHT
FIND YOU HERE.

157
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:44,433
- DARLING...!

158
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,066
- LET'S GO HOME.

159
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:52,533
DIDN'T YOU SAY YOU WANTED
TO RAISE OUR CHILD

160
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,733
NEW LIFE AWAY FROM THE GANG
WORLD?

161
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,000
YES, OF COURSE I DID, BUT...

162
00:12:58,066 --> 00:12:59,966
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

163
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:02,800
COME, WE CAN TALK IN THE CAR.

164
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:09,666
MARIA, I UNDERSTAND YOUR GRIEF
AND HOW VERY DIFFICULT

165
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:11,433
THIS MUST BE FOR YOU.

166
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,500
FORTUNATELY, I WAS
ABLE TO PREVENT YOU

167
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:15,933
FROM MAKING A TRAGIC MISTAKE.

168
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,800
NOW THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

169
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:23,433
MARIA, I HAVE SOME
GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.

170
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,266
I JUST FOUND OUT,
BRANDON IS ALIVE.

171
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:28,300
- WHAT?

172
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:31,266
- IT'S TRUE. I SWEAR.
I WOULDN'T LIE TO YOU.

173
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,300
- WHERE IS HE...

174
00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:35,033
WHERE IS BRANDON RIGHT
NOW? DO YOU KNOW?

175
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,600
- UNFORTUNATELY, HE WON'T BE
LIVING AROUND HERE ANYMORE.

176
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,100
PLANS ON DOING
A LOT OF TRAVELING.

177
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,166
I DON'T THINK WE'LL
SEE HIM AGAIN SOON.

178
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:46,133
IN FACT, WE MAY NEVER
SEE HIM AGAIN.

179
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,266
- DID YOU SEE HIM YOURSELF?

180
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,333
- NO, HE CONTACTED ME
THROUGH ONE OF MY AIDES

181
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,766
WHO TALKED TO HIM
FOR QUITE A WHILE.

182
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,466
- REALLY?

183
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:58,600
- YES.

184
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:04,600
- IF HE'S ALIVE...

185
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,300
( she sobs )

186
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,666
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME!

187
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:13,833
- LISTEN, BRANDON TOLD ME AIDE
TO TELL YOU

188
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,100
IF YOU EVER HAVE AN EMERGENCY
AND NEED HIS HELP,

189
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,933
YOU SHOULD USE THAT
CASE OVER THERE

190
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,033
TO LET HIM KNOW THAT
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.

191
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,866
HE'LL COME TO YOU AS FAST AS
HE CAN NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE.

192
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:32,800
BRANDON HAD ONE OTHER MESSAGE
THAT HE WANTED ME TO GIVE YOU.

193
00:14:32,866 --> 00:14:36,166
HE PRAYS FOR ONE THING,
YOUR HAPPINESS, MARIA.

194
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,966
- YOUR ORDERS, SIR?

195
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:59,366
- TOKIOKA, TAKE CARE
OF MARIA FOR ME.

196
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:01,300
- ARE YOU LEAVING, MASTER?

197
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:05,200
- FOR SOME TIME NOW,
I HAD FORGOTTEN WHO I AM.

198
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:08,266
THAT I AM MILLENNION ITSELF.

199
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,833
- I UNDERSTAND, SIR.

200
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,700
- MARIA, DO YOUR BEST,
MY DARLING.

201
00:15:23,766 --> 00:15:28,066
FIND A NEW LIFE WHERE OUR
CHILD CAN BE RAISED IN PEACE.

202
00:15:41,866 --> 00:15:46,033
IT'S BEEN OVER 35 YEARS SINCE I
FOUNDED MILLENNION.

203
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,566
I'VE SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE
PROTECTING THE ORGANIZATION

204
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:51,033
AND THE FAMILY.

205
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,333
I'VE LIVED LIFE ON MY TERMS.
I HAVE NO REGRETS.

206
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,233
WELL, ONE PERHAPS.

207
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,733
THAT MY TIME WITH MARIA
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN LONGER.

208
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,333
BUT I'M GRATEFUL
THAT SHE CAME INTO MY LIFE.

209
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,000
IT'S BEEN LIKE A DREAM FOR ME.

210
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:09,766
AND BRANDON WAS THE ONE
WHO BROUGHT US TOGETHER.

211
00:16:10,466 --> 00:16:12,733
THANK YOU, BRANDON.

212
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,866
AND I ALSO THANK YOU FOR
ENTRUSTING ME WITH THAT CASE.

213
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:19,533
BUT AS MUCH AS I
APPRECIATE THE GESTURE,

214
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,266
I HAVE NO INTENTION OF USING IT.

215
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,600
I HAVE GIVEN THE CASE TO MARIA

216
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:28,066
AND THE NEW LIFE WITHIN HER
THAT IS ABOUT TO BE BORN.

217
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:30,266
MY ONLY LEGACY.

218
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:35,466
AND SHOULD THEY EVER NEED YOU,
PLEASE RESPOND TO THEIR REQUEST.

219
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:38,966
I'M SORRY, BRANDON.

220
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:42,500
BUT AS THE FOUNDER AND OLDEST
MEMBER OF THIS ORGANIZATION,

221
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:45,900
IT'S ONLY FITTING THAT I HONOR
YOUR MEMORY IN THE PROPER WAY.

222
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,400
- I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT TIME
FOR YOU TO SHOW UP, BIG DADDY.

223
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,433
ACTUALLY I EXPECTED YOU SOONER.

224
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,333
MY GUYS TOLD ME THAT BOTH YOU
AND MARIA WERE HERE EARLIER

225
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,566
BUT THEN YOU
POSTPONED YOUR VISIT.

226
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:10,100
I WOULD HAVE ASKED
YOU TO COME UP BUT I

227
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,500
DIDN'T WANT TO INTRUDE,
SO I HELD MYSELF BACK.

228
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:14,700
ON THE OTHER HAND, MAYBE
I SHOULD HAVE COME OUT

229
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:15,800
AND SAID HELLO.

230
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:17,733
- TELL ME, HARRY MACDOWEL,

231
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,066
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS
FOR ALL THIS?

232
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:23,233
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WITH
THE MILLENNION ORGANIZATION?

233
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,533
- WELL, SINCE IT
IS MY ORGANIZATION,

234
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,233
I'D APPRECIATE YOU KEEPING
YOUR NOSE OUT OF MY BUSINESS,

235
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,433
INCLUDING MY PLANS
FOR THE FUTURE.

236
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,366
- I AM MILLENNION.

237
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:37,033
MILLENNION IS ME
AND I'M MILLENNION.

238
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,000
- THINGS HAVE CHANGED, OLD
MAN. HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED?

239
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:42,233
HARRY MACDOWEL IS
MILLENNION NOW.

240
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,166
-PERHAPS THERE IS HARMONY
IN COMPROMISE.

241
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:46,766
- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

242
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,533
HARMONY IS AN OUTDATED
CONCEPT THAT HAS NO PLACE

243
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,266
IN A MODERN ECONOMY.

244
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,700
HARMONY JUST
LEADS TO STAGNATION.

245
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:55,400
WHEREAS COMPETITION AND RIVALRY

246
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:59,200
RESULT IN PROGRESS
AND PRODUCTIVITY.

247
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:01,266
HARMONY ISN'T ONE
OF OUR STRONG POINTS

248
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,400
AND OUR CLIENTS
LIKE IT THAT WAY.

249
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:05,633
YOU UNDERSTAND, RIGHT?

250
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,600
SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE REALLY
BEGINNING TO LOOK YOUR AGE,

251
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,500
BIG DADDY.

252
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:10,266
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
AND I'M NOT JUST

253
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:14,333
YANKING YOUR CHAIN HERE. I
THINK YOU SHOULD RETIRE.

254
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,933
TAKE A LOAD OFF.
HAVE A SEAT.

255
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,133
CAN I GET YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

256
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,100
I HAPPENED TO GET MY HANDS

257
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,333
ON A BOTTLE OF 28-YEAR-OLD
BOURBON THE OTHER DAY.

258
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:28,933
WHAT DO YOU KNOW!

259
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,400
THIS BOURBON WAS BOTTLED
THE SAME YEAR I WAS BORN.

260
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:34,133
IT MATURED ALMOST
AS WELL AS I HAVE.

261
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,100
- THANKS FOR THE OFFER
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,

262
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,600
I DON'T DRINK BOURBON.
ONLY WHISKEY.

263
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,133
- OH? MAY I ASK WHY?

264
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,866
- BOURBON IS A DERIVATIVE,
DESCENDED FROM WHISKEY.

265
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:46,633
IT'S NOT THE ORIGINAL
AS IT WERE.

266
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:51,500
- WELL THEN, LET'S GET RID

267
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:53,933
OF EVERY OUNCE OF
WHISKEY IN EXISTENCE.

268
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,933
THEN BOURBON BECOMES
THE ORIGINAL, RIGHT?

269
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,700
- WHATEVER MAKES YOU THINK
THAT'S THE WAY THINGS ARE.

270
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:03,600
- MILLENNION IS A GOOD TEACHER.

271
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,466
I THINK THAT WAY
BECAUSE OF MILLENNION.

272
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:09,800
- IS THAT SO?

273
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:13,433
THEN I GUESS I HAVE NO CHOICE.

274
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,900
( cock gun )

275
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,800
( Harry chuckles )

276
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,333
- ARE YOU GOING TO SHOOT ME?

277
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,600
- I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

278
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:25,733
THINK OF IT AS PAYBACK FOR
BRANDON'S LOYALTY AND HIS LIFE!

279
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,066
( gunshot )

280
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:40,966
- SORRY, BUNJI, BUT WOULD YOU
MIND STEPPING OUT FOR A MOMENT?

281
00:19:41,033 --> 00:19:42,700
- SURE, NO PROBLEM.

282
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,000
( door shuts )

283
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,700
- AH, THAT'S GOOD.

284
00:19:54,633 --> 00:19:57,266
NOW LOOK, BIG DADDY,
WHY DON'T YOU AND MARIA

285
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,700
GO LIVE IN A NICE
QUIET LITTLE TOWN?

286
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:02,133
YOU'RE STILL A WORTHWHILE
GUY TO HAVE AROUND.

287
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,700
I DON'T WANNA KILL YOU
IF I DON'T HAVE TO.

288
00:20:05,766 --> 00:20:09,500
- BRANDON KNEW...
BRANDON KNEW EVERYTHING.

289
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:15,133
YOUR BETRAYALS AND SCAMS.
YOUR GRIMY LITTLE CONSPIRACIES.

290
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,800
BUT BRANDON STILL HAD
FAITH IN YOU.

291
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:22,700
BRANDON KNEW?
BRANDON KNEW?

292
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:42,800
SO HE KNEW?
HE KNEW THAT I'D...

293
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,700
( Harry laughs )

294
00:20:56,766 --> 00:20:59,633
- HARRY, IF YOU CARE
ABOUT BRANDON,

295
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,866
MAKE THIS AN ORGANIZATION
HE'D BE PROUD OF.

296
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:05,833
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU SAYING,
YOU OLD BASTARD?

297
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,700
BRANDON DIED BECAUSE OF YOU.

298
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,266
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO
GOT HIM KILLED!

299
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,866
- BRANDON CARED A GREAT DEAL!

300
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:13,400
- DON'T YOU DARE SAY THAT NAME!

301
00:21:13,466 --> 00:21:14,633
( gunshot )

302
00:21:16,966 --> 00:21:19,800
YOU BASTARD! YOU BASTARD!

303
00:21:19,866 --> 00:21:21,833
YOU TOOK HIM AWAY FROM ME!

304
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,100
IF IT WEREN'T FOR
YOU RIGHT NOW,

305
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,400
I COULD HAVE BEEN CLIMBING
THE LADDER WITH BRANDON!

306
00:21:27,466 --> 00:21:30,866
WITH BRANDON!
WITH BRANDON!

307
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:32,366
( gun clicks )

308
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:46,966
NOW IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
KILLING YOU IS NOT ENOUGH.

309
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:51,833
I'LL ERASE YOU LIKE A VIDEO
TAPE. TOTAL OBLITERATION.

310
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,266
I, HARRY MACDOWEL,
THE ALL POWERFUL...

311
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,600
...WILL DESTROY EVERY TRACE
OF YOUR EXISTENCE

312
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,833
FROM THE FACE OF THIS PLANET.

313
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,733
- EVEN FROM THE GRAVE,

314
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,333
THE MAINTAINS HIS LOYALTY
TO THE ORGANIZATION.

315
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,900
SO LOYAL IS BRANDON HEAT.

316
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:15,200
NO... THAT NAME IS
NO LONGER APPROPRIATE.

317
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:17,466
BRANDON HEAT IS NO MORE.

318
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:20,666
YOU'VE COME BACK FROM
BEYOND THE GRAVE.

319
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:22,533
SO THAT WILL BE YOUR NAME.

320
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,633
FROM THIS POINT ON,
YOU ARE BEYOND THE GRAVE.

321
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:37,533
KEEP SLEEPING, GRAVE.

322
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,300
FOREVER...

323
00:24:15,066 --> 00:24:20,000
- THIRTEEN YEARS IS LONG ENOUGH
TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S HEARTS.

324
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:22,700
BUT THERE'S ONE MAN
WHO STOPPED TIME.

325
00:24:22,766 --> 00:24:27,666
HE HASN'T CHANGED AT ALL.
HE JUST KEEPS SLEEPING.
