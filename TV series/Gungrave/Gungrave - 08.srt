00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,133
( theme music playing )

2
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:47,366

00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:52,300

00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,000
( laughing )

NEWEST MEMBERS OF OUR FAMILY.

12
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,466
HARRY MACDOWEL.

13
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:51,066
AND BRANDON HEAT.

14
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:55,066
HARRY AND BRANDON HAVE JOINED US

15
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,933
AS WELL AS TO DO WHATEVER
THEY CAN TO PROTECT OUR FAMILY.

16
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,600
PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING

17
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,066
THESE TWO VERY
SPECIAL YOUNG MEN.

18
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:05,866
- ( applause )

19
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:16,900
- Brandon: THE FAMILY...

20
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:18,833
MILLENNION'S UPPER
LEVEL EXECUTIVES

21
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,566
AND THOSE ACKNOWLEDGED
BY BIG DADDY

22
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,000
AS MEMBERS OF THE
ORGANIZATION'S INNER CIRCLE.

23
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:25,300
ALL UNITED BY
THE CODE OF IRON.

24
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:28,966
THERE IS ONLY ONE PROMISE
WE MUST MAKE,

25
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:30,633
NEVER BETRAY THE FAMILY

26
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:34,966
NEVER EVER BETRAY THE FAMILY.

27
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,733
- Harry: YOU MUST BE
MR. GALARDE.

28
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,700
I'M HARRY MACDOWEL SIR.

29
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:46,000
- MY NAME IS BRANDON HEAT.

30
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:49,233
- I'VE HEARD GOOD THINGS
ABOUT YOU TWO. KEEP IT UP GUYS.

31
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,433
- Brandon: YES, SIR.
- Harry: THANK YOU SIR.

32
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,466
- Bear: SID!
- HUH?

33
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,900
- IS THAT...
BEAR, BEAR WALKEN!

34
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:58,433
- SID GALARDE!

35
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,366
- ( both laughing )

36
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:02,866
- YOU LOOK A LOT OLDER
THAN THE LAST TIME WE MET

37
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:05,966
YOU'VE GOT SO MANY NEW WRINKLES
I BARELY RECOGNIZED YOU.

38
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:07,833
- THE SAME GOES FOR YOU!

39
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,333
- Sherry: HI UNCLE SID,
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU,

40
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,966
- SHERRY! YOU GOT SO BIG!
GUESS WE HAVE GOTTEN OLD.

41
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:16,466
- YES INDEED.

42
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:19,066
- I'D LIKE MY SON TO
JOIN THE FAMILY TOO

43
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,666
BUT HE GETS INTO TROUBLE
ALL THE TIME.

44
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:24,566
I WISH HE WERE A LOT MORE
LIKE THESE TWO YOUNG MEN.

45
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:26,366
- HAVE YOU TWO
INTRODUCED YOURSELVES?

46
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,366
- YES, SIR. WE HAVE.

47
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:31,966
- EXCUSE ME FATHER,
I HAVEN'T BEEN INTRODUCED YET.

48
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:36,000
- YES DEAR, YOU'RE RIGHT.
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU.

49
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:37,733
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER.

50
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,633
- HOW DO YOU DO?
MY NAME'S SHERRY WALKEN.

51
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,133
- WELL HELLO THERE,
I'M A NEW MEMBER OF THE FAMILY.

52
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,033
I'M HARRY MACDOWEL.

53
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,600
- I'M BRANDON HEAT.

54
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,266
- OH!

55
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,333
- SOMETHING WRONG?
- OH!

56
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,866
WELL, UM...

57
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:55,466
THERE ARE SOME
DELICIOUS LOOKING DESSERTS

58
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:58,400
ON THAT TABLE OVER THERE.

59
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:02,700
IF YOU'D LIKE
WE COULD TASTE THEM TOGETHER.

60
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,533
- I'D LOVE TO.

61
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:15,900
- LOOKS LIKE YOUR PARTNER
IS A REAL LADIES MAN.

62
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,900
- LET HARRY KNOW,

63
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:21,500
THAT IF HE FOOLS WITH MY
DAUGHTER IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER

64
00:05:21,566 --> 00:05:23,100
I'LL KILL HIM, UNDERSTAND?

65
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:27,733
- I'LL TELL HIM SIR.
- A PROTECTIVE FATHER.

66
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,366
- OH BEAR, SO THERE
YOU ARE,

67
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:31,700
I'M GLAD YOU COULD
JOIN US TODAY.

68
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:33,333
- SORRY I CAME SO LATE.

69
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,600
I APOLOGIZE SIR. THERE WAS A
MINOR TERRITORIAL DISPUTE,

70
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:37,833
BUT IT'S SETTLED NOW.

71
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,900
- COME NOW,
I KNOW HOW BUSY YOU ARE.

72
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:42,233
THERE'S NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE.

73
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,066
- THANK YOU SIR.
- WELL, SID.

74
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:47,100
I SEE YOU'VE ALREADY
MET MY NEW SON.

75
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,700
PLEASE TAKE GOOD
CARE OF HIM FOR ME.

76
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:53,700
- I CERTAINLY WILL,
BIG DADDY.

77
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:55,400
- IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT THOSE YOUNGSTERS

78
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:58,033
ARE ALREADY MEMBERS
OF THE FAMILY.

79
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,500
BIG DADDY'S BEEN
IN CONTROL OF MILLENNION

80
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:02,366
SINCE HE FOUNDED
IT 30 YEARS AGO.

81
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:04,166
DOES HE HAVE A
SUCCESSOR IN MIND?

82
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:07,233
- NOT YET, HE'S STILL YOUNG.
IT'S GONNA BE A WHILE.

83
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,066
- YEAH, BUT THE BOSS
DOESN'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN.

84
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:12,866
SO SINCE HE HAS NO NATURAL
HEIR, HE SHOULD DECIDE

85
00:06:12,933 --> 00:06:14,366
WHO IT'S GOING TO BE.

86
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:16,733
- I KNOW OF VERY FEW MEN
WHO WOULD BE ABLE

87
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,633
TO TAKE HIS PLACE.

88
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,400
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU BEAR?

89
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:23,266
- NOT ME.

90
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
HMM.

91
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:37,600
- ( door closing )

92
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:38,300
WHAT'S UP?

93
00:06:38,366 --> 00:06:40,600
TWO MEN WERE ROBBED AND KILLED.

94
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,800
IT HAPPENED IN MY TERRITORY.

95
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:46,133
THE MONEY'S NO BIG DEAL BUT
ONE WAS A GUEST FROM ALGERIA.

96
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,066
- HMM.

97
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:50,633
- THE KILLER WILL HAVE TO BE
DEALT WITH AT ONCE.

98
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,766
OR THE ORGANIZATION
WILL LOSE FACE.

99
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,800
WHICH WILL MAKE BIG DADDY'S
JOB EVEN MORE DIFFICULT.

100
00:06:57,866 --> 00:06:59,833
- WELL, I GUESS IN THIS
BUSINESS THERE'S ALWAYS

101
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,033
GONNA BE SOME
KIND OF TROUBLE

102
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,633
BUT IT HAS TO BE DEALT WITH.

103
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,800
- THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

104
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:08,233
- ( laughing ) YES,
EXACTLY RIGHT.

105
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,033
- ( man groaning )

106
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:20,266
- Balladbird: SO, HOW WAS YOUR
DEBUT AT THE FAMILY PARTY?

107
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,433
- BIT NERVE-WRACKING
EVEN FOR ME.

108
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,566
- IF YOU ASK ME,
IT'S NOT FAIR YOU

109
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:26,466
AND BRANDON JOINING THE
FAMILY WITHOUT US.

110
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,800
- YOU'LL GET IN.
JUST GIVE ME SOME TIME.

111
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:31,033
ONCE I'VE GOT A LITTLE MORE
CLOUT IN THE FAMILY,

112
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,000
I CAN RECOMMEND YOU
GUYS TO MY BOSS.

113
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:35,100
WERE COUNTING ON YOU HARRY.

114
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,133
- OF COURSE. 'CAUSE
I'M NOT STOPPING

115
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,800
TILL I GET WHERE
I WANNA GO.

116
00:07:38,866 --> 00:07:41,833
THIS IS THE LIST
OF EVERYONE IN THE FAMILY, BOB.

117
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,833
FIND OUT EVERYTHING YOU CAN
ABOUT THEM, BUT DO IT SECRETLY.

118
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,100
- Bob: I GOT YOU, HARRY.

119
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,133
- THEY CLAIM TO BELIEVE

120
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,766
IN THE CODE OF IRON
BUT IT'S A BIG FAMILY.

121
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,366
I'M SURE THERE ARE
SKELETONS HIDDEN SOMEWHERE.

122
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:55,966
- WOW, YOU'RE KIND OF SCARY.

123
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:57,933
- I GOTTA FIND OUT
IF ANY OF THEM ARE TRAITORS

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,566
FOR THE SAKE OF THE FAMILY.

125
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:01,733
AND FOR MY SAKE AS WELL.

126
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,100
- AH!

127
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:16,133
( sighing )

128
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:19,133
- Brandon: HOW'S IT GOING?

129
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,166
- OH, HEY BRO.

130
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:24,533
THANKS A LOT.
MAN, ARE YOU QUIET.

131
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,233
- I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU'D COME IN.

132
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,366
- SO SEEN THE TARGET?

133
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:31,433
- NOT YET.
THE CURTAINS ARE CLOSED,

134
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,566
AND THE LIGHTS ARE TURNED OFF.

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,533
- HE'S THERE.
- HUH?

136
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:47,700
- I'LL GO CHECK IT OUT.

137
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,633
- IS THIS GUY A MONSTER OR WHAT?

138
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,666
- Brandon: IT'S TAKEN CARE OF.

139
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:04,200
- I SEE, GOOD WORK YOU TWO.

140
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:06,366
I'LL CONTACT YOU
SHORTLY. LOOKS LIKE

141
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:08,100
I'LL NEED ANOTHER FAVOR.

142
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,633
- ANYTIME SIR.
- Bunji: EXCUSE US.

143
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,033
- HEY, I'M SORRY.
RELAX, I WAS JUST TESTING YOU.

144
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,500
- THEY BEAT YOU SID.

145
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,033
- DID YOU TRAIN THEM?
- YEAH.

146
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
- NO WONDER. LOOKS LIKE
BRANDON HERE TURNED OUT

147
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,866
TO BE ONE HELL OF A GOOD STUDENT

148
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:31,300
- HIS FRIEND HERE DID TOO.
- BUNJI KUGASHIRA SIR.

149
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:32,733
- I'LL REMEMBER THAT.

150
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,066
COME ON HAVE A DRINK WITH US.
YOU DO LIKE TO DRINK,

151
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:36,933
- DON'T YOU? 
- SURE.

152
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,900
- ( Sid laughing )

153
00:09:40,966 --> 00:09:43,066
- BEAR AND I HAD JUST
JOINED THE MAFIA

154
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:45,066
WE WERE FIGHTING EACH OTHER
TOOTH AND NAIL TRYING

155
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:47,133
TO GRAB MORE TERRITORY.

156
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,366
AND NEITHER ONE OF US
WOULD GIVE AN INCH

157
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:52,466
SO STUPID AND STUBBORN,
WE ALMOST SHOT EACH OTHER.

158
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:55,300
AND WE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
IF BIG DADDY HADN'T SHOWN UP

159
00:09:55,366 --> 00:09:58,000
AND OFFERED TO
MEDIATE OUR DISPUTE.

160
00:09:58,066 --> 00:10:00,200
TELL YOU THE TRUTH
THE WAY I SEE IT

161
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,666
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR BIG DADDY,
ONE OF US WOULD HAVE ENDED

162
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:04,600
UP IN THE NEXT WORLD FOR SURE.

163
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:08,100
- ONE OF US, MEANING YOU!
- IS THAT SO?

164
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,700
( laughing ) NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

165
00:10:11,766 --> 00:10:13,433
IN THOSE DAYS YOU
WERE STRONG AS

166
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,400
A DEVIL AND TWICE AS ARMORY.

167
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:17,666
- BUT YOU WERE
A LOT MORE POPULAR.

168
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:22,633
- YEAH RIGHT, ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
EVERYONE LIKES SID GALARDE.

169
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,900
COME ON, HAVE ANOTHER DRINK.

170
00:10:25,966 --> 00:10:28,200
- THANK YOU, I HAVE ONE, SIR.

171
00:10:28,266 --> 00:10:30,800
- LOTS MORE WHERE THAT
CAME FROM, RIGHT?

172
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:37,200
- Bunji: HEY BRO...

173
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:40,100
TELL ME, ARE THOSE GUYS
WHAT YOU CALL FAMILY?

174
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,733
YOU SEE, I'M AN ORPHAN.

175
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,466
SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT A FAMILY IS,

176
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:49,033
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

177
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,600
- NEITHER DO I.

178
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:57,633
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU'RE NOT THE TYPE

179
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,966
TO GET THIS DRUNK.

180
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,766
WHAT'S UP SID?

181
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,733
- I SUPPOSE I JUST
GOT CARRIED AWAY,

182
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,866
REMEMBERING HOW
THINGS USED TO BE.

183
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:09,966
- YOU'RE GETTING OLD, SID.
- OH YEAH? LOOK WHO'S TALKING.

184
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:15,200
HEY, BEAR...

185
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,533
GREAT BEING YOUNG
LIKE THOSE TWO ARE.

186
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,766
JUST STARTING UP THE LADDER AND
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE FUTURE.

187
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:27,033
- BUT YOUNGSTERS DO
STUPID THINGS SOMETIMES.

188
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,700
- YEAH, THEY DO. DON'T THEY?

189
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,600
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT...

190
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:46,233
- IT'S HARRY MACDOWEL.

191
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,066
DO YOU KNOW IF BIG
DADDY READ THE MATERIAL

192
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:51,466
I SENT IN THE OTHER DAY?

193
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:52,866
I UNDERSTAND.

194
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:56,433
YEAH, IT WAS PRETTY UNSETTLING.

195
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,666
BUT I KNEW I HAD TO SEND IT
IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE FAMILY.

196
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:01,333
YES, SIR. WHEN YOU
SEE BIG DADDY,

197
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,966
WOULD YOU PLEASE
GIVE HIM MY BEST?

198
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:06,400
RIGHT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

199
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:10,233
- Sherry: SORRY TO
KEEP YOU WAITING.

200
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,466
- THAT'S OKAY,
I JUST GOT HERE MYSELF.

201
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:16,266
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL DRESS,
YOU LOOK GREAT!

202
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,600
- THANK YOU, MR. MACDOWEL.

203
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,533
- PLEASE, CALL ME HARRY.

204
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,866
- ( gasping ) OH!

205
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:05,466
- PRETTY SWEET!

206
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:07,500
- ( phone ringing )

207
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,900
- HELLO?

208
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:12,600
IT'S FOR YOU.

209
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,966
- THIS IS BRANDON.

210
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,600
- WHAT A STUPID THING TO DO.

211
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:30,533
BRAT!

212
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:32,866
IDIOT...

213
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,100
- HUH?
- Sid: WHERE'S EDDIE?

214
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,900
- WHAT'S GOING ON OLD MAN?

215
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:42,366
- ( groaning in pain )

216
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:45,000
- I ASKED YOU WHERE EDDIE IS,
NOW ANSWER ME.

217
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:47,133
- HE'S IN THE BACK, SIR!

218
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,366
- ( door opening )

219
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:52,133
- HUH, OH, HI!
WHAT'S UP DAD?

220
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,733
HEY WAIT TILL YOU HEAR THIS.

221
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,033
I GOT A TIP THAT ALGERIA
PULLED UP A BIG HEIST

222
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,000
AND EVERYTHING THEY
GOT IS OURS NOW.

223
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:01,533
( groaning in pain )

224
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,500
- YOU STUPID IDIOT!
- HUH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

225
00:14:04,566 --> 00:14:06,700
THIS JOB CAME OFF
WITHOUT A HITCH.

226
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:09,733
AND ALL WITNESSES ARE DEAD,
YOU SHOULD BE THANKING ME.

227
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,100
( groaning in pain )

228
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,133
- YOU ACTED WITHOUT PERMISSION!

229
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,000
- I'M NOT ALLOWED TO DO
ANYTHING ON MY OWN.

230
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:18,166
WELL THAT'S GONNA CHANGE
STARTING NOW.

231
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,333
- YOU THINK I'D LET A
SCUMBAG LIKE YOU DECIDE

232
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,833
HOW TO RUN THE BUSINESS?

233
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,800
ONE OF THOSE MEN YOU KILLED,
WAS BEAR WALKEN'S GUEST,

234
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,900
YOU NITWIT.

235
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:31,800
- HUH! UNCLE BEAR'S?
HOLY SHIT! IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

236
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:33,866
HOW WAS I SUPPOSE TO KNOW
WHO HE WAS?

237
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:35,566
- WHETHER YOU KNEW
WHO HE WAS OR NOT,

238
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:38,233
DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT
THAT YOU KILLED A GUY!

239
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,033
THE ORGANIZATION WILL LOSE
FACE AND BE DISGRACED

240
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,966
BECAUSE OF
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

241
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,966
- ( crying )
HELP ME. OH PLEASE HELP ME,

242
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:49,800
I DON'T WANNA DIE.

243
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:52,800
PLEASE DAD, PLEASE,
PLEASE I'M BEGGING YOU.

244
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:54,133
HELP ME...

245
00:14:54,866 --> 00:14:58,333
HELP ME DAD! PLEASE!

246
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,100
HELP ME, DAD! HELP ME!

247
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,733
( crying )

248
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:08,333
- THAT STUPID IDIOT!

249
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,466
- UNCLE ASAGI.

250
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:24,366
- FOR GOODNESS SAKE,
DRINKING AT THIS HOUR?

251
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:26,200
IT'S A LITTLE EARLY ISN'T IT?

252
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,000
WHAT IS IT UNCLE?

253
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:36,066
- AS A LEADER I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR MAKING A LOT OF DECISIONS.

254
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:40,066
DECISIONS WHICH ARE
SOMETIMES VERY DIFFICULT.

255
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:42,066
SOMETIMES I'M FORCED
TO MAKE CHOICES

256
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:45,800
THAT IN MY HEART,
I FEEL ARE WRONG.

257
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:47,500
I'VE HAD TO MAKE
DECISIONS LIKE THAT

258
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:49,933
EVER SINCE I WAS A YOUNG MAN.

259
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,266
BUT I STILL HAVEN'T
GOTTEN USED TO IT.

260
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:13,933
SID...

261
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:18,866
SID GALARDE...

262
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,400
- YOU MIND, IF I SIT DOWN?

263
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,166
- HAVE A SEAT.

264
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,200
HMM.

265
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:16,333
- Sid: HOW DID YOU KNOW
WHERE TO FIND ME?

266
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,000
- THIS IS THE TERRITORY
YOU AND I USED TO FIGHT OVER.

267
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,233
- Sid: YOU THINK WE
RISKED OUR LIVES FIGHTING

268
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,800
FOR A WORTHLESS PLACE LIKE THIS?

269
00:17:27,866 --> 00:17:30,566
- Bear: YEAH.
WE WERE PRETTY DUMB.

270
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,433
- ( Both laughing )

271
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:45,433
- SO HOW LONG HAVE
YOU KNOWN BEAR?

272
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,933
- SINCE THAT NIGHT

273
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,533
WHEN YOU SAID YOU
DIDN'T WANNA GO HOME

274
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,066
AND FELL ASLEEP ON MY COUCH.

275
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:53,433
THAT WASN'T LIKE YOU, SID.

276
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,633
IT SURE AS HELL WASN'T LIKE
THE SID GALARDE I KNOW.

277
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,166
- HMM, I SEE...

278
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:03,666
- IT JUST WASN'T LIKE YOU.

279
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,833
- Sherry: YOU MEAN UNCLE SID?

280
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,600
- YEAH, HE AND YOUR FATHER
SEEM TO BE VERY GOOD FRIENDS.

281
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,000
- YES THEY ARE.

282
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:13,966
THEY'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR A REAL LONG TIME,

283
00:18:14,033 --> 00:18:15,533
SINCE BEFORE I WAS BORN.

284
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,900
- I SEE. SO THEY'RE
REALLY CLOSE THEN.

285
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:19,766
- YEAH, SURE.

286
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,900
I ONCE ASKED MY DAD
WHO HIS BEST FRIEND WAS

287
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:23,500
AND HE SAID IT WAS UNCLE SID.

288
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:26,333
- HE'S LIKE FAMILY TO ME.
- IS THAT SO...

289
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:32,000
- I THINK YOUR DAD'S
A REALLY GENTLE HEARTED MAN.

290
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,200
- AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

291
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,400
OH MAN, BREAKS YOUR HEART.

292
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:47,766
- BEAR, I'M HOPELESSLY DUMB.
EVEN DUMBER THAN I USED TO BE.

293
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,233
I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT LOYALTY
TO THE ORGANIZATION

294
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,733
WAS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN ANYTHING.

295
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,700
WHEN I HAD A
CHANCE TO PROVE IT,

296
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:58,166
I CHOSE MY SCUMBAG
OF A SON INSTEAD.

297
00:18:59,766 --> 00:19:02,166
- Sid: TAKE IT AND
GET OUT OF TOWN!

298
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:03,166
- BUT DAD!

299
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:05,133
- DON'T EVER COME BACK AGAIN.

300
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,200
ANYONE FROM THE ORGANIZATION
WHO SEES YOU WILL KILL YOU.

301
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:14,800
EVEN IF IT'S ME! I'LL KILL YOU!
FOR THE ORGANIZATION.

302
00:19:14,866 --> 00:19:18,466
- BUT DAD...
- GET THE HELL OUT! RIGHT NOW!

303
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,900
- ( crying ) WHERE WILL I GO?
- NOW, GET GOING!

304
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,700
- IF WE SAY THE KILLER ESCAPED
THEY'LL QUESTION OUR INTEGRITY

305
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:34,066
OUR REPUTATION WILL
SUFFER IRREPARABLE DAMAGE

306
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:36,700
WHAT HAPPENS IN MY TERRITORY
INCLUDING MISCONDUCT,

307
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:39,133
IS MY RESPONSIBILITY.

308
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,166
AS A MEMBER OF THE ORGANIZATION
AND AS A FATHER,

309
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:44,766
I ACCEPT THAT RESPONSIBILITY.

310
00:19:49,366 --> 00:19:51,433
SORRY IF YOU
FIND THIS BOTHERSOME.

311
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,800
- I CERTAINLY DO.

312
00:20:56,933 --> 00:20:59,733
- ( Sid crying )

313
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,433
EDDIE!
