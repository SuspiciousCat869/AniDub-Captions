1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,933
( theme music playing )

2
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:48,066
- ( inaudible )

3
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:51,500
WE HAVEN'T BEEN OUT
DRINKING LIKE THIS IN...

4
00:01:51,566 --> 00:01:53,900
SHIT, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW LONG.

5
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:55,233
- TWO MONTHS.

6
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,800
- THAT LONG, HUH?

7
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,866
- YEAH, COUPLE OF MONTHS.
THAT'S ALL.

8
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:03,266
- HAS THE TRAITOR
BEEN DEALT WITH?

9
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:04,966
- IT'S DONE.

10
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:06,533
- I SEE.

11
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,766
BUT HE WAS JUST
THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG,

12
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,933
USING A FIRM LIKE PUBLIC STEAM
VESSELS TO SMUGGLE FIREARMS

13
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,233
WOULD TAKE SOME CLOUT,

14
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,800
A BIG WIG WORKING FROM
BEHIND THE SCENES.

15
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:21,400
MAYBE A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY.

16
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:25,366
NEVER BETRAY THE FAMILY.

17
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:28,033
NEVER BETRAY THE FAMILY.

18
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,533
THIS IS A ROTTEN BUSINESS.

19
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:33,266
TO MILLENNION.

20
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:34,966
- TO MILLENNION.

21
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,766
- BOSS.
- HUH?

22
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,633
- WHAT IS IT?

23
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,266
SIR, SORRY TO BOTHER YOU
BUT WE RECEIVED A REPORT

24
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,066
FROM LEAGLAND'S
INVESTIGATING TEAM.

25
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:01,833
I DIDN'T MEAN TO BARGE IN
ON YOU LIKE THAT,

26
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,866
I KNOCKED A FEW TIMES,

27
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,466
AND WHEN NO ONE ANSWERED, I...

28
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:05,766
- WELL. LET ME HEAR IT, THEN.

29
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:06,966
- YES, SIR.

30
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:10,100
YEARLY TRANSACTIONS OF COMPANIES
MANAGED BY HARRY MACDOWEL

31
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,500
INCLUDING HOTEL
AND CASINO OPERATIONS,

32
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:15,400
AND THE IMPORT AND EXPORT
OF FINE ART COLLECTIONS

33
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:17,766
HAVE RESULTED IN TOTAL SALES
OF APPROXIMATELY

34
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,133
70 MILLION YULE.

35
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,066
AND NET PROFIT OF 23 MILLION.

36
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:24,866
- I SEE. AND HOW MUCH
DOES HE PAY THE FAMILY?

37
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:26,733
- SIX MILLION, SIR.

38
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,766
- SO, A CLEAR PROFIT
OF 17 MILLION YULE A YEAR

39
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,800
IS GOING DIRECTLY
INTO HARRY'S POCKET.

40
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:34,500
- BUT HIS DECLARED ANNUAL
INCOME IS ONLY 7 MILLION,

41
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:36,766
LEAVING MORE THAN HALF
THE PROFITS UNACCOUNTED FOR.

42
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,666
A TOTAL OF TEN MILLION YULE.

43
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:40,733
- HMM. WITH THAT KIND
OF MONEY, HE COULD BUY

44
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,366
A FIVE STAR HOTEL.

45
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:44,066
SO WHERE'S THE MONEY GOING?

46
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:45,533
- WE DON'T KNOW.

47
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,266
HOWEVER, THE VERY FACT
THAT HE'S HIDDEN

48
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,100
HIS EXPENDITURES
SO THOROUGHLY

49
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,566
LEADS US TO BELIEVE THAT
HARRY MCDOWELL IS INVOLVED

50
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:53,933
IN SOME KIND
OF UNDERHANDED ACTIVITY.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,800
- ALL RIGHT. TELL
LEAGLAND'S TEAM

52
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:59,200
TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL
FROM NOW ON.

53
00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:02,000
HARRY KNOWS HOW WE OPERATE
AS WELL AS ANYONE,

54
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:04,766
INCLUDING THE FACT
THAT WITHOUT SOLID EVIDENCE,

55
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,466
WE WON'T REPORT
OUR SUSPICIONS TO BIG DADDY.

56
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:09,066
- VERY GOOD, SIR.

57
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:16,000
- HARRY MCDOWELL...

58
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:18,233
I NEVER IMAGINED THAT
A PUNK LIKE THAT

59
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,066
WOULD BE ABLE TO CLIMB
THIS HIGH UP THE LADDER.

60
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:24,600
HE'S SHARP. I SENSED THAT
THE MOMENT I MET HIM.

61
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:28,333
FELT CERTAIN THAT I WAS RIGHT.
BUT I WAS WRONG.

62
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,800
HE'S TOO SHARP.

63
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:31,966
WAY TOO SHARP!

64
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,433
- SORRY I TOOK SO LONG!

65
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,666
- OH. THANK YOU, SWEETHEART.

66
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:46,366
- YOU WERE DAYDREAMING.
WHAT'S WRONG, HARRY?

67
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:47,600
- NOTHING.

68
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,033
- BY THE WAY, YOU HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE.

69
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,566
- COST A BUNDLE.

70
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:53,833
BUT I HAD TO MAKE SURE
THAT THE PERSON I'M GONNA SPEND

71
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,933
THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,633
IS SO HAPPY HERE,
SHE'LL NEVER WANT TO LEAVE.

73
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,800
- ( moans )

74
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:04,066
SHE IS VERY HAPPY.

75
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:06,500
- AND INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL
AS WELL.

76
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:10,433
- ( both gasp )

77
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,200
- Harry: BEAR WALKEN...

78
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:15,000
- A FRIEND OF MINE TOLD ME
YOU BOUGHT THIS PLACE, HARRY.

79
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,566
I HAPPENED TO BE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

80
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:18,633
SO I THOUGHT I'D STOP BY.

81
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,266
YOU DON'T SAY? I'M GLAD YOU DID.

82
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,966
- YOU DIDN'T JUST STOP BY.

83
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:25,433
YOU ALWAYS KNOW
EXACTLY WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

84
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,866
- Harry: I'LL TELL THEM
TO ADD ANOTHER PLACE

85
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:27,966
AT THE DINNER TABLE.

86
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:29,233
WOULD THAT BE ALL RIGHT?

87
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,266
- YEAH.

88
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:39,666
- ( whispers ) IT'S ME.

89
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:41,266
THE FLOWER IN JUNE...

90
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,100
DOESN'T DIE.

91
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,266
GEEZ, LEAGLAND?
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT, BRO?

92
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,333
- GIVE ME THE STUFF.

93
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:03,266
- YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
WHAT I HAD TO GO THROUGH

94
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,533
TO GET THAT STUFF.

95
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,333
I MEAN IT WAS
ORDERED DIRECTLY

96
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,066
BY THE FAMILY, WASN'T IT?

97
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:10,200
- YEAH.
- WELL...

98
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:12,733
- YOU SAID YOU'D GIVE ME
A TERRITORY TO CONTROL...

99
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,133
- I'M AFRAID NOT.

100
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:18,166
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- SORRY.

101
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:19,200
- ( grunts )

102
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:26,400
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

103
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:30,933
- SAM, WHAT WERE YOU DOING
WITH THIS GUY?

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,700
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
WITH LEAGLAND,

105
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:34,900
THE MAN IN CHARGE OF RANDY'S
ESPIONAGE TEAM.

106
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:37,000
- HEY, HOLD ON BRO.

107
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:38,933
I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING WRONG.

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,366
HE SAID THE ORDER CAME
FROM SOME BIG WIG IN THE FAMILY

109
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:42,633
OR ELSE I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.

110
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,000
I'M NO TRAITOR, BRO.

111
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:45,666
I WOULD NEVER BETRAY
THE FAMILY.

112
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:46,766
NEVER!

113
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:52,100
- I BELIEVE YOU, SAM.

114
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,233
- THANKS, BRO.

115
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,500
- ( knife crunches )

116
00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:02,400
- NEVER BETRAY...

117
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,033
- POOR SAM. WHAT A SHAME.

118
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,066
AND AFTER ALL THAT HARD WORK...

119
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:11,133
BUT WHEN YOU'RE WORKING
FOR A BOSS LIKE MINE,

120
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,600
THERE IS NO OTHER CHOICE.

121
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,333
HE GIVES THE ORDERS
AND I HAVE TO FOLLOW THEM.

122
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:29,666
- HEY OLD MAN, TIME TO GO.

123
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:32,000
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

124
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:42,166
- BRANDON?

125
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:46,166
- BRANDON, MY MOTHER
PASSED AWAY.

126
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,033
THANKS, BRANDON.

127
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,366
AND NOT JUST FOR THE FLOWERS.
THANKS TO YOU,

128
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:01,066
I WAS ABLE TO PUT HER
IN A HOSPITAL,

129
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:03,366
AND SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO
SUFFER IN THE END.

130
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:07,200
I WAS ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF HER
AND SHE DIED WITH DIGNITY.

131
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:09,100
NOT TOO BAD FOR A
SON WHO'D NEVER

132
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,533
MADE HIMSELF WORTHY
OF HIS MOTHER.

133
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,033
- YOU DIDN'T CALL ME.

134
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,700
- I'M JUST A MONEY COLLECTOR,

135
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:17,700
I'M ON THE BOTTOM
OF THE FOOD CHAIN.

136
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:19,366
WOULDN'T BE RIGHT FOR
ME TO BOTHER ONE

137
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,000
OF THE ORGANIZATION'S
TOP EXECUTIVES

138
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:22,300
WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

139
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:24,533
- WE'RE IN TWO
SEPARATE WORLDS NOW.

140
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,266
- YOU'RE WRONG.

141
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,833
- THERE'S ONLY ONE WORLD.

142
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,833
- ( both exclaim in surprise )

143
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,133
- SORRY, I COULDN'T
GET HERE SOONER.

144
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,166
- I'M HONORED. BIG DADDY!

145
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:46,500
- MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES.

146
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:49,566
WIDGE BURNS, TAKE COMFORT
IN KNOWING THAT YOUR MOTHER

147
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:51,533
RESTS IN ETERNAL AND
HEAVENLY PEACE.

148
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,500
- SIR, I THANK YOU
FOR COMING TODAY.

149
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,500
I'M JUST SO GRATEFUL.

150
00:08:59,766 --> 00:09:01,400
THANK YOU, BIG DADDY.

151
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:10,366
- GOSH, YOU WERE RIGHT
ALL ALONG, BRANDON.

152
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:22,000
- SORRY, BRANDON.
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND

153
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:24,566
BEING SUDDENLY ASKED
TO BE MY BODYGUARD LIKE THIS.

154
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:26,033
- NOT AT ALL.

155
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,333
- THERE'S A GUEST
IN A PRIVATE ROOM

156
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,933
AT A RESTAURANT
CALLED VALENTINA.

157
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,900
I WANT YOU TO FIND OUT
WHAT HIS INTENTIONS ARE,

158
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:35,700
MALICIOUS OR OTHERWISE.

159
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:36,866
- YES, SIR.

160
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:52,266
- SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

161
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,133
- YEAH.

162
00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:56,600
- ( chews noisily )

163
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:07,166
- LIKE IT, SIR? I HAD THEM
CHANGE THE MENU AROUND.

164
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:09,633
I WANTED TO BE SURE
THAT YOU ENJOYED YOUR MEAL.

165
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,433
- HOW CONSIDERATE.

166
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,600
- DADDY, WHY ARE YOU HERE?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

167
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,266
AN DON'T YOU DARE TELL ME
YOU CAME TO EAT.

168
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,933
- ( gulping )

169
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,266
- SHERRY...

170
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:28,866
WHY DON'T YOU GO FOR A WALK?

171
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:34,100
- ARE YOU DONE
WITH YOUR MEAL, SIR?

172
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,033
- YES, THANKS.
YOU HAVE AN EXCELLENT CHEF.

173
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,666
- WELL, THEN...

174
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,766
I AGREE. LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE.

175
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:46,266
HARRY MCDOWELL, HOW HIGH UP
THE LADDER DO YOU WANT TO GO?

176
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:52,766
- TO THE TOP. I PLAN
ON BEING MILLENNION'S NEXT BOSS.

177
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:56,766
ALONG WITH MY PARTNER,
BRANDON HEAT.

178
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,266
- RIGHT THROUGH THERE, SIR.

179
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,800
- I CAN'T TAKE
BIG DADDY'S PLACE.

180
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:11,333
AT LEAST NOT ALONE, BUT AS
LONG AS BRANDON'S THERE

181
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,700
TO BACK ME UP, NO ONE
WOULD BE ABLE TO STOP ME.

182
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:16,500
WITH BRANDON HEAT AT MY SIDE,

183
00:11:16,566 --> 00:11:19,600
I CAN CLIMB AS FAST
AND AS HIGH AS I WANT.

184
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,466
LISTEN, I KNOW THE
OLD SAYING TOO,

185
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:23,633
"THE HIGHER YOU GET, THE
GREATER THE RISK."

186
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,100
AND EVEN IF YOU'RE TOUGH ENOUGH
TO GET TO THE TOP,

187
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,433
YOU FIND OUT THAT IT'S MORE
DANGEROUS THAN ANYWHERE ELSE.

188
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,533
TRUTH IS, I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M STRONG ENOUGH.

189
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,266
STILL, EVEN IF I'M NOT NOW,
I WILL BE SOON.

190
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,766
I JUST NEED SOME SUPPORT
FROM SOMEONE

191
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,833
LIKE YOUR DAUGHTER, SIR.

192
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,033
SO, WITH YOUR BLESSING,
SHERRY AND I WOULD...

193
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,300
- SHUT UP.

194
00:11:52,966 --> 00:11:56,766
SAVE YOUR WORDS.
THE TRUTH IS IN YOUR EYES.

195
00:11:58,366 --> 00:12:00,133
EYES NEVER LIE.

196
00:12:23,866 --> 00:12:25,800
HARRY MACDOWEL.

197
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,800
TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY DAUGHTER.

198
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,200
- IT'S BEEN SO LONG.

199
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:47,566
I MISSED YOU, BRANDON.

200
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:54,800
THEY KEEPING YOU BUSY AT WORK?

201
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:57,266
- IN A WAY.
- AND HARRY...

202
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,300
ARE YOU TWO STILL GETTING ALONG?

203
00:12:59,366 --> 00:13:02,333
- YEAH.
- YOU TWO DON'T GET IN FIGHTS?

204
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,433
- NO.
- WHEN YOU'RE AT WORK,

205
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,866
ARE YOU IN DANGER?

206
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:07,266
- NOT REALLY.

207
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,733
- WELL, HAVE A SEAT.

208
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,033
- THANKS ANYWAY.

209
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,600
- YOU'RE TOO BUSY, THEN?

210
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,366
- YEAH.
- I SEE.

211
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:25,266
OH, I NEVER THANKED YOU
FOR THE GIFT.

212
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:28,833
THE DRESS. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

213
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,566
- OH.
- WELL...

214
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:32,966
- DO YOU LIKE IT?
- SURE.

215
00:13:33,033 --> 00:13:34,800
- REALLY?
- REALLY.

216
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,733
- BRANDON.

217
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,466
TAKE A LOOK AT ME, A GOOD LOOK.

218
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:46,566
I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT ME.

219
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:49,700
I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT YOU,
WHAT YOUR LIFE IS LIKE AND

220
00:13:49,766 --> 00:13:52,100
WHAT YOUR PLANS ARE.
I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING

221
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,433
ABOUT YOU BUT YOU
WON'T TELL ME ANYTHING.

222
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,400
WHY, BRANDON?
WHY WON'T YOU TALK TO ME?

223
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,600
- NOTHING TO SAY.

224
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:15,266
SORRY, GOT TO GET BACK TO WORK.

225
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:21,466
- WAIT!

226
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:24,600
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

227
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,533
AFTER ALL THIS TIME,
DON'T YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL?

228
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,800
OH, BRANDON, DON'T YOU KNOW
THAT I...

229
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,700
- YOU SEE, THIS IS MY JOB.

230
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,133
I'M A HIT MAN.

231
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,133
- ( crying )

232
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:20,266
- BRANDON...

233
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,933
I'M SORRY.

234
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,033
I KNOW HOW FOOLISH IT IS
FOR AN OLD DINOSAUR LIKE ME

235
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,166
TO FEEL THIS WAY.

236
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:31,200
- DO YOU MEAN THE WAY
YOU FEEL ABOUT MARIA?

237
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:32,666
- I LOVE HER.

238
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,900
- ( chuckles nervously )

239
00:15:36,966 --> 00:15:41,266
YES, I KNOW. "AN OLD MAN
WITH A GIRL AS YOUNG AS MARIA."

240
00:15:42,966 --> 00:15:45,266
RIDICULOUS, LAUGHABLE.

241
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:47,833
- I'M GLAD.

242
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:51,900
GLAD THAT I JOINED MILLENNION.

243
00:15:51,966 --> 00:15:55,766
I FEEL THIS IS WHERE
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE.

244
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,133
- ( sobbing )

245
00:15:59,566 --> 00:16:01,800
- Brandon: GO INSIDE.

246
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:03,200
SHE'S WAITING FOR YOU.

247
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:20,966
- ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP, HARRY.

248
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:22,733
- ( moans )

249
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
MY DADDY TOLD ME

250
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:28,200
THAT I SHOULD STAY HERE
WITH YOU TONIGHT, HARRY.

251
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:29,466
- DID HE NOW?

252
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,633
- DON'T LET GO, HARRY.
PLEASE DON'T LET GO.

253
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,800
- OF COURSE NOT!

254
00:16:35,866 --> 00:16:38,800
- WE'LL CLIMB AS HIGH
AS WE WANT, BRANDON.

255
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:41,266
RIGHT. WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER.

256
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,666
FOR THE FREEDOM THAT COMES
WITH POWER AND CONTROL.

257
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,733
FOR MILLENNION...

258
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,366
- WE CAN'T MAKE CONTACT
WITH LEAGLAND?

259
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:18,533
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN?
WHAT ABOUT HIS TEAM?

260
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,900
- PROBABLY DEAD, SIR.

261
00:17:20,966 --> 00:17:24,266
BOSS, THERE'S ONE ANOTHER THING
THAT'S, WELL, PRETTY STRANGE.

262
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:29,600
A DEPOSIT OF TEN MILLION YULE
IN MY SECRET ACCOUNT?

263
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,200
YES, SIR. WE STILL DON'T KNOW
WHERE IT CAME FROM.

264
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:33,533
- THEN FIND OUT.

265
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,200
- ( tires screeching )

266
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:36,333
- WHAT'S UP?

267
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,233
- BOSS, THEY BLOCKED THE ROAD.

268
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,466
- WHAT?

269
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:41,566
- ( car honking )

270
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:43,366
- RANDY IS VERY SUSPICIOUS.

271
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:45,233
HE'S WATCHING HARRY LIKE A HAWK

272
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,133
BUT NOW IT WILL LOOK LIKE
RANDY IS A TRAITOR

273
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,966
TRYING TO DIVERT
ATTENTION FROM HIMSELF

274
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:51,066
BY SETTING HARRY UP
TO TAKE THE FALL.

275
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:52,600
WHICH MEANS WE'RE GOING
TO PIN THE BLAME

276
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,166
FOR THE FIREARMS SMUGGLING
ON RANDY, RIGHT?

277
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:56,833
- RIGHT.
- OKAY.

278
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,933
- BUT WHO'S GOING TO
TAKE OUT RANDY?

279
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,433
THEY'LL ONLY GET ONE CHANCE.

280
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,066
IF THEY SCREW IT UP, BEAR WALKEN
WILL SEND IN HIS OVERKILLS

281
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:04,900
AND IT'S ALL OVER.

282
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:07,933
I'VE GOT JUST THE RIGHT MAN
FOR THIS JOB.

283
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,266
A STONE COLD KILLER
WHO ALWAYS GETS THE JOB DONE.

284
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:16,266
- IT'S BUNJI KUGASHIRA!

285
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,666
- YOU DIDN'T BETRAY
MILLENNION, I KNOW THAT.

286
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,000
BUT YOU DID BETRAY
HARRY MCDOWELL.

287
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,600
SEE YOU, RANDY.

288
00:18:49,966 --> 00:18:51,700
- ( woman crying )

289
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:22,966
- I WOULDN'T BE IN
THE ORGANIZATION

290
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:24,733
IF IT WEREN'T FOR RANDY.

291
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,200
HE'S THE ONE
THAT RECOMMENDED ME.

292
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,900
HE TAUGHT ME WHAT IT MEANT
TO BE A MEMBER OF MILLENNION.

293
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:32,600
IF IT WEREN'T FOR
HIS FAITH IN ME

294
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,566
AND HIS RECOMMENDING
ME TO BIG DADDY,

295
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:37,000
IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME YEARS
TO ADVANCE THIS FAR.

296
00:19:38,866 --> 00:19:41,900
BUT, HE BROKE THE CODE OF IRON.

297
00:19:41,966 --> 00:19:43,633
HE BETRAYED THE FAMILY.

298
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,866
AND TRAITORS DESERVE
ONLY ONE THING.

299
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,566
DEATH. END OF STORY.

300
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,900
- DO YOU KNOW WHY
HE BETRAYED US?

301
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,366
HARRY?

302
00:19:55,966 --> 00:19:57,833
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
HE DID IT.

303
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,766
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
RANDY WAS A TRAITOR.

304
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,266
HE WAS MORE LOYAL TO BIG DADDY
THAN ANYONE, EVEN ME.

305
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,600
AND YET, I DECIDED
TO BELIEVE YOU

306
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:16,866
BECAUSE SHERRY'S LIFE IS IN YOUR
HANDS, HARRY MCDOWELL.

307
00:20:18,366 --> 00:20:20,900
- YOU DO YOUR PART
AND I'LL DO MINE.

308
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:23,466
- WHERE'S BRANDON?

309
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:25,266
- TYING UP SOME LOOSE ENDS.

310
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,333
- I SEE.

311
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,033
- YOU'RE BRANDON HEAT!

312
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,433
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING!
NOTHING AT ALL!

313
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,066
- ALL TRAITORS HAVE TO DIE.

314
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,666
- ( gun shots firing )

315
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,266
- ( screams )

316
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,533
- EVERYTHING BEEN
TAKEN CARE OF, BRANDON.

317
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,533
- OKAY.
