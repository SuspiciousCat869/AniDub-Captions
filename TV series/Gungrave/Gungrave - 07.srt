- ( elevator bell dings )

19
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,800
- Brandon: I WISH I'D KNOWN
THEN, WHAT I KNOW NOW.

20
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:13,133
I WISH I COULD'VE TOLD MYSELF,
"PROTECTING PEOPLE MEANS THAT

21
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,966
YOU GET TO MAKE THEIR WELL BEING
MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR OWN".

22
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:19,966
- HUH, HEY! HEY YOU THERE!

23
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:24,000
- HOLD ON, HE'S NOT
INVOLVED IN THIS.

24
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:26,300
- ( sirens wailing )

25
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:30,700
- Brandon: BUT THE KIND
OF PROTECTION I PROVIDED

26
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:32,700
MEANT SOMETHING ELSE AS WELL.

27
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:37,300
- ( engine starting )

28
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:41,366
- ( tires screeching )

29
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:42,866
- BECAUSE PROTECTING
THE KIND OF PEOPLE

00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:45,166
I WAS WORKING FOR ALSO MEANT...

31
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,100
NEVER BETRAYING THEM.

32
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:52,200
NEVER.

33
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:30,800
- ( camera clicking )

34
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,966
- Man: THE NEW FACE
OF MILLENNION.

35
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:39,066
THIS IS BRANDON HEAT.

36
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:40,966
HE'S THE ORGANIZATION'S SWEEPER.

37
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:44,933
HE GETS HIS ORDERS FROM
BEAR WALKEN, THE SENIOR EXEC.

38
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,600
RUMOR HAS IT,
THIS GUY'S A REAL GO-GETTER.

39
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,833
BALLADBIRD LEE, WHOSE FATHER
WAS A PROMINENT POLITICIAN,

40
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,600
HAS POWERFUL ALLIES
IN THE POLITICAL ARENA.

41
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:57,333
AND THE INNER CIRCLES
OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY.

42
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,433
HE'S AMBITIOUS AND WANTS
TO CLIMB THE LADDER

43
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,033
AS QUICKLY AS HE CAN.

44
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,366
- SOME SAY HE KILLED
HIS OWN FATHER TO GET AHEAD.

45
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:06,200
AND THIS IS BOB POUNDMAX.

46
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,066
DON'T LET HIS
APPEARANCE FOOL YOU.

47
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:11,066
POUNDMAX IS IN CHARGE OF
THEIR INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS.

48
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:12,900
HE'S AN EXPERT AT
GATHERING INFORMATION

49
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:15,266
AND FINDING THE MOST
EFFECTIVE WAY OF USING IT

50
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,066
TO INCREASE MILLENNION'S PROFITS
OR TO CRUSH THEIR ENEMIES.

51
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:22,033
- SOME SCARY GUYS!
- YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

52
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,166
- THE ONE WHO LEADS
THESE MONSTERS IS THIS GUY.

53
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:28,700
HIS NAME...
IS HARRY MACDOWEL.

54
00:06:28,766 --> 00:06:31,733
STOCK, JEWELRY,
FINE ART, GAMBLING...

55
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,066
HE HAS EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE
ABOUT ANYTHING INVOLVING MONEY.

56
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:38,766
AND SUPERVISES MILLENNION'S
MONEY LAUNDERING OPERATIONS.

57
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,866
HE'S SHARP, CAPABLE AND
THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATE

58
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:45,366
FOR BECOMING A MEMBER OF
THE MILLENNION FAMILY.

59
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:48,200
- Bunji: SO, THOSE
ARE MY TARGETS?

60
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:51,133
THOSE ARE THE GUYS YOU WANT
ME TO KILL ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

61
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,366
- THAT'S RIGHT.

62
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:55,866
THE FIRST MOVE IN THIS
LITTLE WAR GAME, IS YOURS.

63
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:58,400
'CAUSE YOU'RE THE BEST,
MAD MAN BUNJI.

64
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:00,700
I KNOW I CAN COUNT ON YOU.

65
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:02,866
- DON'T EVER CALL ME
BY THAT NAME.

66
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:04,066
- Man 1: HOLD IT.
- Man 2: BASTARD!

67
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:06,266
- Man 3: WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

68
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,933
- ALRIGHT, BUT LET ME
MAKE THIS PERFECTLY CLEAR.

69
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,600
THE ONLY REASON I'M GONNA
HELP YOU GUYS OUT,

70
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,633
IS 'CAUSE TARGETING AN
OUTFIT LIKE MILLENNION

71
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,200
IS BIG, REAL BIG. IN FACT NO
ORDINARY GUY COULD PULL IT OFF.

72
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:20,766
BUT I DO THINGS ORDINARY
GUYS CAN'T DO.

73
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:25,866
- ER, RIGHT, THANKS BUNJI.
I MEAN, MR. KUGASHIRA.

74
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,100
- Man: THIS IS FOR ME?

75
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,766
- Harry: YES, SIR.
LACCINO'S "SLEEPING WOMAN."

76
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,366
IT'S THE GENUINE ARTICLE.

77
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:36,500
THE AUTHENTICATED ORIGINAL.

78
00:07:36,566 --> 00:07:39,966
- I SEE. IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

79
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:44,733
AND HOW MANY COUNTERFEIT
ORIGINALS DID YOU MAKE?

80
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,866
- HUH. TEN OF THEM SIR.

81
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,233
ALONG WITH TEN
LETTERS OF AUTHENTICITY.

82
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,466
I SOLD THEM TO A
BUNCH OF RICH DUMMIES,

83
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:53,600
AS HIDDEN ASSETS IT
WON'T GET TAXED.

84
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,533
SO THERE'S NO WAY
THEY'LL TURN US IN.

85
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,766
- HOW MUCH A PIECE HARRY,
AROUND TWO MILLION YULE OR SO?

86
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,600
- FOUR MILLION SIR.

87
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:04,433
- SO THE TOTAL WAS
FORTY MIL. NICELY DONE.

88
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,766
VERY WELL, HARRY MACDOWEL.

89
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,866
THERE'S A FAMILY BANQUET
AT BIG DADDY'S NEXT MONTH.

90
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:15,500
AND I'M INVITING YOU
TO COME HARRY.

91
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:18,666
I'LL LET BIG DADDY KNOW.
HE'LL BE EXPECTING YOU.

92
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,700
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SIR!

93
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:25,033
- YOU'VE PROVEN YOUR
LOYALTY TO MILLENNION.

94
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,066
- MAY IT ALWAYS PROSPER, SIR.

95
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:30,466
- RUN ALONG NOW.
- RIGHT, I'LL BE GOING.

96
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,400
- EXCUSE ME, SIR.
- HMM?

97
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:41,766
- I HEAR THAT THE PRICE
OF CRUDE IS ABOUT TO GO UP.

98
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,866
YOU MIGHT WANNA GIVE
IT SOME THOUGHT, SIR.

99
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:45,833
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

100
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:49,066
- HMM.

101
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,533
- I'M OUT OF HERE MAGGIE,
SEE YOU LATER.

102
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,500
- OH, HARRY...

103
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,666
- THIS IS IT BRANDON.
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

104
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,233
- Maria: THINGS ARE GOING PRETTY
WELL AT WORK. BUT, I'D LIKE

105
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,233
TO BE DOING SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING

106
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,833
THAN FILING DOCUMENTS ALL DAY.
AND THE PAY IS SO LOW.

107
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,766
I WON'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD
A PLACE OF MY OWN FOR A WHILE.

108
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,833
- I SEE.
- FROM THE LOOK OF THAT SUIT

109
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,100
YOU MUST BE DOING
PRETTY WELL FOR YOURSELF.

110
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,566
- THANKS TO HARRY.

111
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:29,566
- I DIDN'T KNOW SHIPPING
COMPANIES MADE SO MUCH MONEY.

112
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:32,800
MAYBE I SHOULD GO ASK THEM
TO GIVE ME A JOB TOO.

113
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:35,766
- I DON'T WANT THEM
TO GO BELLY UP.

114
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,200
- HUH?

115
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:39,666
HEY, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

116
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:46,166
YOU KNOW I USED TO THINK
OF YOU AS MY LITTLE BROTHER.

117
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:48,900
BUT YOU'RE GROWING UP
SO FAST, I FEEL...

118
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,200
LIKE I'M THE BABY, NOT YOU.

119
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,533
- I'VE GOT A LOT TO LEARN.

120
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:08,033
- FIVE YEARS...

121
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,433
JOLICE, NATHAN, KENNY...

122
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,733
IT TOOK LONGER THAN
I THOUGHT IT WOULD.

123
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,333
BUT NOW BRANDON AND
I ARE MOVING UP IN THE WORLD.

124
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,366
MAN, WHAT A GREAT VIEW.

125
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:27,100
I JUST WISH YOU GUYS
WERE HERE TO SEE IT.

126
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,066
- ( phone ringing )

127
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:40,133
- THIS IS HARRY.
- HEY, HARRY. IT'S ME, BOB.

128
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,500
- YOU'RE UP LATE,
WHAT'S GOING ON, BOB?

129
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:46,766
- LISTEN, I'VE JUST RECEIVED AN
INCREDIBLE PIECE OF INFORMATION.

130
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:50,266
- EXCITING STUFF, TRUST ME.
- OKAY. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

131
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,400
- OH, AND PICK UP SOME OF
THAT DOUBLE CRISPY CHICKEN

132
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:53,900
ON THE WAY WILL YOU?

133
00:10:53,966 --> 00:10:57,166
- ( laughing ) YEAH, SURE.

134
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:05,200
- ( knocking on door )

135
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:07,666
- HUH?
- BRANDON!

136
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:11,300
HEY LONG TIME NO SEE.
HOW THE HELL YOU BEEN BUDDY?

137
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:12,766
- Brandon: HERE, TAKE IT.
- HUH?

138
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,700
YOU MEAN YOU BROUGHT US A GIFT?

139
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:16,533
MAN, YOU SURE HAVE
CHANGED BRANDON.

140
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,800
YOU WERE NEVER THIS NICE BEFORE.

141
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:22,633
- WELL BRANDON, DON'T JUST
STAND THERE. COME ON IN.

142
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,333
- OKAY, THANK YOU, SIR.

143
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,100
- ( phone ringing )

144
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,166
- Harry: WE'RE BEING
TARGETED? YOU SURE?

145
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:31,100
- Bob: YEAH, LOOKS LIKE
A CORPORATION

146
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,633
BY THE NAME OF FERGUSON
CONTACTED AN ORGANIZATION

147
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,433
CALLED THE GASHAW GANG.

148
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,700
- ( tape playing )

149
00:11:36,766 --> 00:11:38,133
- IT COULD BE THOSE
GUYS WE STOLE THAT

150
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,400
DISTRIBUTION ROUTE FROM
NOT TOO LONG AGO.

151
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:43,200
- LOOKING FOR PAYBACK.
- OH BOY!

152
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:45,933
- THIS COULD GET MESSY.
- Bob: WHAT SHOULD WE DO, HARRY?

153
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,066
- THEY'RE A LEGIT COMPANY RIGHT?

154
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:50,466
THAT MEANS THEY'RE
VULNERABLE TO EXPOSURE.

155
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:52,966
A LITTLE INTIMIDATION SHOULD
GET THEM TO BACK OFF.

156
00:11:53,033 --> 00:11:54,133
- MMM-HMM.

157
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,566
- NOW, CAN YOU GET ME SOME
INFO ON THIS GASHAW OUTFIT?

158
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,933
- ALREADY DID HARRY. HAVE A
LIST OF ALL THEIR MEMBERS.

159
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
HERE YOU ARE.

160
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:02,733
- CURRENT AND UP TO DATE.
- NICE WORK BOBBY BOY

161
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:07,900
- HMM.

162
00:12:07,966 --> 00:12:10,366
- SOMETHING WRONG HARRY?

163
00:12:10,433 --> 00:12:11,766
- ( laughing )

164
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,866
- WELL, WHAT A NICE SURPRISE!

165
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:23,133
- ( snoring )

166
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:27,600
- SO HOW ARE THINGS GOING?

167
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,900
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE MOVING
UP IN THE WORLD.

168
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:32,433
- NOT REALLY.

169
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,833
- DON'T BE SO MODEST.

170
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,533
THEY GAVE US A NEW OFFICE
INSTEAD OF THAT RAT HOLE WE HAD.

171
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,833
BECAUSE YOU PUT IN
A GOOD WORD FOR US, RIGHT?

172
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,100
NOW THAT THEY'VE
EXPANDED MY CREW,

173
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:48,166
I'VE GOT A LOT MORE TIME
TO TAKE CARE OF MY MOTHER.

174
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:51,500
I'M GRATEFUL, BRANDON.
THANK YOU.

175
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:54,533
BUT DON'T TRY TO MOVE TOO FAST.

176
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,033
IT'S NOT WORTH RISKING
YOUR LIFE FOR.

177
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:01,200
- Brandon: YES, SIR.

178
00:13:37,866 --> 00:13:39,900
- HUH?

179
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:42,400
- Harry: FAST AS
GREASED LIGHTENING.

180
00:13:42,466 --> 00:13:46,033
OR SO I'VE HEARD ANYWAY.
BUNJI KUGASHIRA.

181
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,000
- ARE YOU STUPID OR WHAT?

182
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:50,400
I'VE STILL GOT PLENTY
OF AMMO LEFT.

183
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:52,866
- I DOUBT THAT A GUY WITH A
REPUTATION LIKE YOURS

184
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,100
WOULD DO ANYTHING FOOLISH.

185
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,133
WELL, AT LEAST LET ME
HAVE A DRINK.

186
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,000
IF I'M GONNA DIE I MIGHT AS WELL
FEEL A LITTLE BETTER, RIGHT?

187
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,933
- BUNJI KUGASHIRA, HOW WOULD
YOU LIKE TO JOIN MILLENNION?

188
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,066
- HUH?

189
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:16,866
- THE MILLENNION ORGANIZATION
NEEDS A GUY LIKE YOU.

190
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:19,733
EVEN IF WE HAVE TO PAY YOU TEN
TIMES MORE THAN YOU'RE GETTING.

191
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,566
- NOW.

192
00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:22,866
- NO WAY. THE MONEY
DOESN'T MATTER.

193
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:26,200
WHAT DOES, IS THAT A MAN OF
HONOR ALWAYS KEEPS HIS WORD.

194
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,233
AND I'M AN HONORABLE MAN.

195
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:33,166
- WHAT ABOUT THEM? WHAT IF
THEY HAVE ACTED DISHONORABLY?

196
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:34,500
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

197
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,866
- ( gunshots )

198
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,500
- WELL DONE.

199
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:57,566
- Harry: THE ONES THAT
HIRED YOU, THE GASHAW GANG

200
00:14:57,633 --> 00:14:59,833
USED TO BE A PART OF THE
VOLCANO ORGANIZATION

201
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,900
WHICH CONTROLS THE
SOUTHERN REGION.

202
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:03,866
BUT THEY WERE SO
STUPID AND UNRELIABLE

203
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:07,566
THAT VOLCANO BOOTED THEM OUT.
AND NOW A SUPPOSEDLY RESPECTABLE

204
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:11,400
CORPORATION HIRES THAT SAME
BUNCH OF PUNKS TO GET RID OF ME?

205
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:15,233
THIS ISN'T A FIGHT FOR TERRITORY
OR SOME MAFIA FAMILY'S HONOR.

206
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,600
IT'S ABOUT MONEY, THAT'S ALL.

207
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,633
IN OTHER WORDS, GASHAW'S
USING YOU AS A CONVENIENT WAY

208
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,966
OF MAKING SURE THEY
GET PAID OFF.

209
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:26,333
- HMM. WHY SHOULD I
BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU SAY?

210
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,533
- IT'S TRUE, I PROMISE YOU THAT.

211
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,700
BUT THERE'S NO WAY I
CAN PROVE IT TO YOU.

212
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:32,033
SO WHAT I SUGGEST,

213
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,233
IS THAT WE HAVE A LITTLE
TALK WITH THE GASHAW BOYS.

214
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,700
- YOU SERIOUS?

215
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:40,266
- I TOO AM AN HONORABLE MAN.

216
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,766
- Bear: I'VE BEEN WANTING TO
ASK YOU THIS FOR A LONG TIME.

217
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,100
WHY ARE YOU THE FIRST TO
VOLUNTEER FOR EVERY JOB

218
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,833
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE?

219
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,900
- ( gunshot )

220
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:59,233
- BIG DADDY!

221
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,633
- Brandon: I GUESS...

222
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,400
I GUESS, YOU AND I HAVE THE SAME
REASON FOR DOING WHAT WE DO.

223
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:23,933
- I SEE.

224
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:28,866
- ( phone ringing )

225
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:31,933
- Bob: BRANDON, BRANDON!
I THINK HARRY IS IN TROUBLE!

226
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,966
- HMM?

227
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,500
- HE CALLED ME AND TOLD ME,

228
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:37,200
IF I DON'T HEAR FROM
HIM WITHIN TWO HOURS,

229
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:39,233
I SHOULD ASK YOU
TO GO TO THIS PLACE,

230
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,300
IT'S THE HANGOUT OF SOME PUNKS
CALLED THE GASHAW GANG.

231
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:44,066
I TRIED TO STOP HIM BRANDON,

232
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,866
BUT HE SAID HE HAD TO,
HE HAD NO CHOICE.

233
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,166
- ( tires screeching )

234
00:17:04,966 --> 00:17:08,333
- YO! BACK KIND OF EARLY,
AREN'T YOU?

235
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,933
WHAT'S WRONG? YOU DIDN'T
BLOW THE DEAL WE MADE, DID YOU?

236
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,766
- JUST WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO, YOU PUNK?

237
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:21,600
- ( laughing )

238
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:25,233
YOU DID IT.
I KNEW YOU WOULD, BUNJI.

239
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,933
- SO, WHO'S THE
NEXT ONE ON THE LIST?

240
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,033
- MATTER OF FACT,
THE NEXT ONE IS YOU, MAD MAN!

241
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,733
- SO, YOU PLAN ON GIVING
MY HEAD TO MILLENNION,

242
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,266
TO PATCH THINGS UP WITH
THE ORGANIZATION, RIGHT?

243
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,733
YOU THINK SMALL, DON'T YOU?
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO

244
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,733
PULL SOMETHING BIG
FOR SOME REAL MONEY.

245
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,566
- YOU KNOW WHAT MILLENNION'S
NEW FACES ARE WORTH?

246
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:53,366
I'LL GET A MILLION YULE
FOR EACH ONE I KILL.

247
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:55,033
HOW'S THAT FOR REAL MONEY?

248
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,633
- Bunji: THAT'S NOT NEARLY
ENOUGH, YOU CHEAP BASTARD.

249
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,066
- WHAT?

250
00:17:58,133 --> 00:17:59,500
- ( gun shot )

251
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:00,766
- ( gasps )

252
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,766
- ( all gasping )

253
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,433
- BASTARD!

254
00:18:14,933 --> 00:18:16,966
- WELL, NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

255
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:18,800
- OH I UNDERSTAND ALRIGHT.

256
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:21,433
TIME TO TEACH THESE
PUNKS THEIR FINAL LESSON.

257
00:18:25,466 --> 00:18:27,700
- AH!

258
00:18:27,766 --> 00:18:31,833
- THAT WAS AWESOME. NOW I WANT
YOU TO JOIN US MORE THAN EVER.

259
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,700
BUNJI KUGASHIRA!

260
00:18:33,766 --> 00:18:35,266
- ( engine roaring )

261
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,733
- Harry: WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

262
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,300
- HUH!

263
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:44,466
- DAMN IT!

264
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,833
- HA! NOW YOU DIE.

265
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,200
- ( car tires screeching )

266
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:02,400
- Both: AH!

267
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,633
- BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.

268
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,833
- HEY!
- WHERE'D THEY GO?

269
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,833
- HUH? AH!

270
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,466
- ( gunshot )

271
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:15,466
- ( guns firing )

272
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,766
- ( all screaming )

273
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:24,866
- AH!

274
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:39,066
- AH!
- AH!

275
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,133
- AH!
- AH!

276
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,966
- Harry: HOLD IT, BRANDON.

277
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:55,500
DON'T SHOOT HIM.
HE'S ON OUR SIDE.

278
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,533
- HEY, I DON'T KNOW IF
I'M ON YOUR SIDE OR NOT.

279
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,133
I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.

280
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,266
- WILL YOU STOP PLAYING
HARD TO GET, BROTHER.

281
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,566
- ALRIGHT, I'LL JOIN
YOUR OUTFIT ON ONE CONDITION.

282
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:13,800
WE'RE GONNA FIGHT
AND YOU'VE GOTTA WIN.

283
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:15,200
'CAUSE I WON'T
FOLLOW YOUR ORDERS,

284
00:20:15,266 --> 00:20:17,700
TILL YOU PROVE YOU'RE
BETTER THAN ME.

285
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:18,900
FAIR ENOUGH?

286
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,200
- THAT'S FINE BY ME,
BUNJI KUGASHIRA.

287
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:25,866
BETTER DO YOUR BEST,
BECAUSE IF YOU LOSE THIS FIGHT,

288
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,466
MY FRIEND BRANDON'S GONNA
BE YOUR NEW BOSS.

289
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:29,566
- WHATEVER.

290
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,200
- I'LL DO IT HARRY.
- BRANDON...

291
00:20:36,266 --> 00:20:40,133
- YOU'LL DO JUST FINE. OR I'LL
TAKE YOU BOTH ON IF YOU LIKE.

292
00:20:44,866 --> 00:20:47,066
- ( growling ) AH!

293
00:20:48,966 --> 00:20:50,066
- ( punching )

294
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,700
- Man: WAIT A MINUTE!
YOU CANT GO IN THERE.

295
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:56,733
- Bunji: OH, SHUT UP!

296
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,400
- ( gasps )

297
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:01,666
WHO, WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

298
00:21:01,733 --> 00:21:03,433
- SO, YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT?

299
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,133
- BRANDON, ARE YOU HURT?

300
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,900
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR CHEEK?

301
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:13,566
- NOTHING...
NOTHING AT ALL, SIR.

302
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:14,766
-AH!

303
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:17,900
I SEE...

304
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,300
( laughing )

305
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:24,533
- Bunji: IF YOUR COMPANY IS
HAVING SOME SORT OF

306
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,433
BUSINESS PROBLEM, YOU COULD
MAKE INTERNAL CHANGES

307
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,366
OR NEGOTIATE WITH
YOUR COMPETITORS

308
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:32,433
BUT NEVER TRY TO SOLVE IT BY
INVOLVING THE MOB, GOT IT?

309
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,266
- WHO ARE YOU?

310
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,133
- HEY, YOU WON'T MAKE
THAT MISTAKE AGAIN.

311
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:46,433
- Harry: SO, DID YOU
TEACH HIM A LESSON?

312
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,100
- Bunji: YEAH.
- ALRIGHT, THAT'S GREAT.

313
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,566
- TELL ME SOMETHING.
- WHAT'S THAT?

314
00:21:51,633 --> 00:21:55,733
- WILL I GET ANYTHING EXTRA?
FOR HAVING YOU AS MY BOSS?

315
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,200
- AS A MATTER OF FACT YOU WILL,
MY FRIEND.

316
00:21:58,266 --> 00:22:01,400
SO MUCH YOU'LL
GET SICK OF IT.

317
00:22:01,466 --> 00:22:03,933
- THANKS IN ADVANCE, BIG GUY.

318
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,366
- Harry: DON'T MENTION IT.

319
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,233
- BRANDON, WHAT IS IT?
YOU'RE ALL THUMBS TODAY?

320
00:22:24,633 --> 00:22:27,466
- Brandon: I WISH I'D KNOWN
THEN, WHAT I KNOW NOW.

321
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:31,033
I WISH I SAID TO MYSELF,
"PROTECTING PEOPLE MEANS

322
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,633
THAT YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE
THEIR WELL BEING

323
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,233
"MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR OWN."

324
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,100
AND IT ALSO MEANS, THAT
TO KEEP PROTECTING THEM,

325
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,966
YOU MUST NEVER BETRAY THEM.

326
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:42,033
NEVER.

327
00:22:44,566 --> 00:22:47,233
- ( pop song playing )

328
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,066
- ( man singing )

329
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:19,700
- Brandon: YOU SHALL NOT BETRAY
YOUR ORGANIZATION. YOUR FAMILY.

330
00:24:19,766 --> 00:24:23,033
THE PENALTY FOR BETRAYAL
IS DEATH. NO EXCEPTIONS.

331
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:28,433
THAT'S THE RULE, IRONCLAD AND
UNCHANGEABLE. THAT'S MILLENNION.
