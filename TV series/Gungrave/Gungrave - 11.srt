1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,433
( theme music playing )

2
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,433
- ( inaudible )

3
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:50,200
- Brandon: I'M GOING TO TURN
THIS PLACE INTO A BATTLEFIELD.

4
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:52,800
I WON'T LET THOSE
BASTARDS ESCAPE.

5
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,466
I DON'T CARE IF I WIN OR LOSE.

6
00:01:57,433 --> 00:01:59,900
IT'S ENOUGH TO DIE
ON EACH OTHER'S SWORD.

7
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:03,066
- WHAT'S UP, LITTLE BUDDY?

8
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:05,233
YOU WANNA GO TO WAR
ALL BY YOURSELF?

9
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:07,800
- Brandon: YEAH.

10
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:12,833
- VERY INTERESTING...
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

11
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:19,333
- Brandon: I'LL PROTECT...

12
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,866
I'LL PROTECT...

13
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,666
I'LL PROTECT...

14
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,866
BECAUSE I'M...

15
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,333
- ( gunfire )

16
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:49,866
- HMM?

17
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:05,066
- SO, LITTLE BUDDY...

18
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:08,733
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY PET
MONSTERS, IMPRESSIVE HUH?

19
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,433
THEY WANT ONLY ONE THING.

20
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:20,500
TO MAKE SURE MY
DREAMS COME TRUE.

21
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:27,266
TO MAKE SURE MY
DREAMS COME TRUE.

22
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,233
- Blood War: YOU CAN'T
KILL THEM LIKE THAT.

23
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,833
TRY BLASTING THEM INTO PIECES.

24
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,200
- ( gun clicks )

25
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:11,566
- D-POINTS, HUH?
YOU'RE WELL PREPARED.

26
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:15,233
WANNA GO OUT IN A BLAZE OF
GLORY, RIGHT, LITTLE BUDDY?

27
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,766
WELL, IT'S NOT MUCH
OF A BATTLEFIELD,

28
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,566
BUT IT'LL HAVE TO DO.

29
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,466
AND I'LL BE RIGHT HERE
WITH YOU TILL THE VERY END.

30
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:33,533
- DON'T TRY ANYTHING,
LEE. YOU MAY BE FAST,

31
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,200
BUT EVEN YOU CAN'T
BEAT A BULLET.

32
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:37,166
- MAYBE. MAYBE NOT.

33
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:39,433
AS A RULE, BULLETS
AREN'T VERY EFFECTIVE

34
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,966
UNLESS THE PERSON
WHO IS FIRING THEM

35
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:43,100
CAN HIT THE INTENDED TARGET.

36
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,500
- HMM! YOU THINK
I'M A RANK AMATEUR...

37
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:47,400
( gasps )

38
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,300
- Balladbird: ELIMINATE ANY
HINT OF ONE'S EXISTENCE...

39
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:57,633
I WAS TRAINED BY EXPERTS, HARRY.

40
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,700
- ( groans in pain )

41
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,300
- DAMN, THAT HURTS!

42
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:11,600
WHERE...

43
00:05:12,466 --> 00:05:14,433
WHERE THE HELL IS HE?

44
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:17,866
- ( gunfire )

45
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,866
- A BULLETPROOF VEST?

46
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:39,366
EVEN SO, YOU GOT AT LEAST
A COUPLE OF BROKEN RIBS,

47
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:41,400
LITTLE BUDDY,
I'M SURE YOU DO.

48
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,733
BUT YOU TOOK OUT
SIX OF MY GUYS.

49
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,066
THAT'S A PRETTY
IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE.

50
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:50,166
BE A REAL SHAME TO WASTE
ALL THAT TALENT BY KILLING YOU.

51
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:53,500
SO LISTEN, WHY DON'T YOU JOIN
ME? WE'D MAKE A GREAT TEAM.

52
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:55,366
- ( panting )

53
00:05:57,633 --> 00:06:00,600
- FINE. YOU'LL DIE FIRST
AND THEN JOIN ME.

54
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,033
IT'S ALMOST TOO GOOD
TO BE TRUE, ISN'T IT?

55
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:10,600
MY PARTNER, CANNON VULCAN,

56
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,800
GOT HOLD OF A NEW TECHNOLOGY
THAT ALLOWS HIM TO

57
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:14,100
REVIVE THE DEAD

58
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,566
AND TURN THEM INTO UNSTOPPABLE
KILLERS UNDER OUR CONTROL.

59
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:20,700
IT'S A PROCESS
CALLED NECROLYZATION.

60
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:21,700
AND WHEN YOU'RE DEAD,

61
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:25,100
WE'LL REVIVE YOU THE SAME
WAY, LITTLE BUDDY.

62
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,800
AFTER YOU'VE BEEN NECROLYZED,

63
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:29,100
YOUR FIRST MISSION WILL
BE TO KILL YOUR BOSS,

64
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,466
BIG DADDY OF MILLENNION.

65
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:34,100
( laughs )

66
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,133
NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL DRAMATIC.

67
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,033
I'M SURE THE AUDIENCE
WILL LOVE IT.

68
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:45,433
- ( gunshots )

69
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,333
- I OWE YOU GUYS.

70
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,633
AND NOW, IT'S PAYBACK TIME.

71
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,500
BUNJI KUGASHIRA STYLE!

72
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:08,833
SOMEONE DOES A NUMBER ON ME,

73
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,566
THERE'S NO WAY I'M NOT
GONNA PAY HIM BACK.

74
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,166
- LOOKS LIKE I'M ABOUT TO GET
ANOTHER PAWN TO NECROLYZE.

75
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:26,733
- CHECKMATE. GAME'S OVER.
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE HISTORY,

76
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,266
HARRY MACDOWEL.

77
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:39,933
- YOU KNOW, THIS JUST
ISN'T LIKE YOU, LEE...

78
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,466
WHATEVER YOU'RE THINKING,
THINK ABOUT THIS TOO.

79
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:46,600
IF YOU WANNA GET TO THE
TOP, THEN LIKE IT OR NOT,

80
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,066
YOU'RE GONNA BE
BETTER OFF WITH ME

81
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:49,833
THAN ANYONE ELSE.

82
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,966
YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO SAVE YOUR SKIN.

83
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:54,100
- TAKE A LOOK AROUND, LEE.

84
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:02,100
- WHY...

85
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,200
YOU COULD'VE HAD
ME KILLED ANY TIME.

86
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,033
- ( laughs )

87
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,200
- BECAUSE THEIR TARGET
WAS BALLADBIRD LEE.

88
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:15,333
I DIDN'T LET THEM SHOOT
BECAUSE IT WAS YOU.

89
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,266
I HAD TO GET THROUGH
THAT THICK SKULL OF YOURS

90
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,300
TO MAKE YOU SEE THAT WE SHOULD
BE WORKING TOGETHER,

91
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,366
NOT AGAINST EACH OTHER.

92
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:26,600
YOU KNOW ME
BETTER THAN ANYONE, LEE.

93
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,433
YOU KNOW MY AGENDA,
YOU KNOW WHAT MY GOALS ARE.

94
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,833
SO I HAVE NO DOUBT YOU KNOW
WHAT MY PLANS ARE

95
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,600
FOR MILLENNION'S FUTURE.

96
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:38,800
IF YOU FOLLOW MY LEAD
AND JOIN BRANDON AND BOB

97
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:40,100
AS A MEMBER OF THE TEAM,

98
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,300
YOU'LL GET TO THE TOP,
I PROMISE YOU.

99
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,200
I NEED YOU.

100
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:48,466
SO I'LL TAKE YOU WITH ME.
ALONG WITH YOUR AMBITIONS.

101
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:53,766
I'LL TAKE YOU WHERE
YOU WANNA GO, LEE.

102
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,333
- WHAT ABOUT
THE CODE OF IRON?

103
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,600
I'VE BETRAYED THE
ORGANIZATION...

104
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:00,566
- WHAT I'M OFFERING YOU
IS THE KIND OF FREEDOM

105
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:03,033
THAT TRANSCENDS
THE CODE OF IRON.

106
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,300
FREEDOM.

107
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,666
- YOU'VE BEEN BLASTING AWAY
FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW.

108
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:23,800
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A BREAK? GIVE
THEM A LITTLE TIME TO RECOVER?

109
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:25,033
- NO WAY!

110
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,266
- YOU AREN'T AS USED TO
BEING IN HELL AS I AM.

111
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,466
- BUNJI!

112
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:39,100
- DAMN MILLENNION TO HELL!

113
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,600
- BUNJI!

114
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,233
JUST HANG IN THERE!

115
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:47,933
- I'LL BE ALL RIGHT...

116
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,133
I KNEW IT WAS COMING.

117
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,066
BUT THOSE MONSTERS ARE
ABOUT TO GET UP AGAIN,

118
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:55,533
WHICH I FIND PRETTY DAMN
ANNOYING, DON'T YOU?

119
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
- YEAH.

120
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,833
- COME ON, YOU WIMPS!
DON'T STOP NOW.

121
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,000
THIS PLACE IS FINALLY TURNING
INTO A DECENT BATTLEFIELD!

122
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:03,966
COME ON!
LET'S HAVE SOME FUN!

123
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,466
- I WONDER IF BRANDON
IS ALL RIGHT...

124
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:11,000
- Man: PLEASE, SIR! IF
YOU JUST WAIT HERE...

125
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:12,800
HARRY ISN'T IN
RIGHT NOW AND...

126
00:10:12,866 --> 00:10:15,433
- TELL ME WHERE I CAN
FIND BRANDON HEAT?

127
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:24,266
- TWENTY YEARS...

128
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,900
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN TWENTY YEARS,

129
00:10:25,966 --> 00:10:29,233
I FEEL LIKE I'VE FINALLY BECOME
WHAT I WAS MEANT TO BE.

130
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,233
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, LEE?

131
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,066
I TOLD YOU NOT TO COME HERE,
DIDN'T I?

132
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:37,433
YOU SHOULD BE AT MILLENNION,

133
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,466
MAINTAINING YOUR COVER
AS A LOYAL MEMBER

134
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:41,100
OF THE ORGANIZATION.

135
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,933
- IS THAT WHAT YOU HAD IN
MIND FROM THE BEGINNING

136
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,766
WHEN YOU KILLED OUR
FATHER AND SENT ME

137
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,033
TO JOIN MILLENNION?

138
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,666
- Vulcan: ANCIENT HISTORY.

139
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,066
- SO TELL ME, BIG BROTHER.

140
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:54,333
IF YOUR PLAN WORKS AND YOU
TAKE OVER MILLENNION...

141
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,233
WHAT THEN? WHAT DO YOU
PLAN TO DO NEXT?

142
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:03,233
- I PLAN TO GO TO WAR.
- GO TO WAR?

143
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,100
- IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO.

144
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,433
I'LL GO TO WAR
AGAINST THE WORLD.

145
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,633
BLOOD AND I WERE DRAFTED
TO FIGHT IN A WAR,

146
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,400
OUR GOVERNMENT STARTED
FOR IT'S OWN SELFISH REASONS.

147
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:20,066
WE WENT THROUGH HELL
IN THAT SHITHOLE OF A PLACE

148
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:22,200
MORE TIMES
THAN I CARE TO REMEMBER.

149
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:26,166
BUT WE DO REMEMBER...

150
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:28,633
NEITHER BLOOD NOR I
WILL EVER FORGET IT...

151
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,633
WHICH IS WHY NEITHER OF US
WILL EVER FORGET THAT SUNSET.

152
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,233
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
IF THERE'S GONNA BE A WAR,

153
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,100
WE'LL BE THE ONES WHO START IT.

154
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:41,700
WHEREVER WE WANT,
WHENEVER WE WANT...

155
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:43,666
- Balladbird: THAT'S NONSENSE.

156
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:47,333
- WHAT?
- I SAID THAT'S NONSENSE.

157
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,766
BESIDES, WITH SUCH
PETTY AMBITIONS,

158
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,666
YOU DON'T STAND A CHANCE
OF BEATING THE GUY

159
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:53,533
YOU'RE COMPETING AGAINST.

160
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,433
THE GUY BY THE NAME
OF HARRY MACDOWEL!

161
00:11:58,066 --> 00:11:59,533
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

162
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,633
- ( gunfire )

163
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:11,100
- BUNJI!

164
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,933
- DON'T WORRY. I'M STILL HERE.

165
00:12:19,633 --> 00:12:20,666
- SO WHAT NOW, LEE?

166
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:23,100
YOU GONNA KILL YOUR OWN
BLOOD BROTHER?

167
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,833
BECAUSE MACDOWEL'S
TURNED YOU AGAINST ME?

168
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,233
- NO! BECAUSE WHAT YOU SAID
IS SO DISAPPOINTING.

169
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:32,466
MY GOAL IS TO
END UP AT THE TOP.

170
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:34,933
AND WITH HARRY,
I KNOW I CAN GET THERE.

171
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:40,333
I'LL BE BALLADBIRD LEE,
MILLENNION EXECUTIVE!

172
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,833
NECROLYZATION?

173
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,400
- YOU'RE A STUPID MAN.

174
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,533
- ( gunfire )

175
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:54,300
- BRO!

176
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:07,300
- IT'S A REAL SHAME...

177
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:09,166
- IT CERTAINLY IS.

178
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,233
- IT WAS A GOOD FIGHT.

179
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,533
IT WAS A GOOD BATTLEFIELD.

180
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,233
WELL, GUYS, IT'S BEEN FUN.

181
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,433
- Brandon: I GUESS THIS IS IT.

182
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:33,566
- WHAT?

183
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,400
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON, TOKIOKA?

184
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:49,000
- THE RESULTS
THAT I WAS EXPECTING.

185
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,266
THE DURATION OF THE
NECROLYZATION EFFECT

186
00:13:56,333 --> 00:14:00,933
IS ONE WEEK AT THE MOST. AS
MY CALCULATIONS PREDICTED.

187
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,200
- YOU KNEW, ALL ALONG.
- IMPOSSIBLE AMBITIONS

188
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:09,400
TEND TO DISINTEGRATE
IN THE FACE OF REALITY.

189
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:11,600
HISTORY IS FULL OF
OVERLY AMBITIOUS MEN

190
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,500
WHO FAILED AND YOU WILL, TOO.

191
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:16,533
- YOU BASTARD!
- BROTHER...

192
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,800
PREPARE YOURSELF!

193
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:22,266
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
WHY'RE THEY JUST LYING THERE?

194
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,900
WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG WITH THEM?

195
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:25,633
- THEY BROKE.

196
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,700
- HUH? YOU'RE HISTORY,
LITTLE BUDDY.

197
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,300
( gasps )

198
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:58,233
- NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND, LEE?
YOU'VE REACHED YOUR LIMIT.

199
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,633
BUT LIMITS LIKE THAT
DON'T EXIST.

200
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,433
WHEN YOU'RE A MEMBER
OF MILLENNION.

201
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:16,333
YOU CHOSE ME,
AND MILLENNION.

202
00:15:17,466 --> 00:15:19,500
THIS IS WHAT IT
MEANS TO CHOOSE.

203
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:31,400
- BUNJI...
- YEAH?

204
00:15:31,466 --> 00:15:34,566
I'M STILL AMONG THE LIVING,
AT LEAST I THINK.

205
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,333
- YOU WERE CONDUCTING A
SECRET INVESTIGATION INTO

206
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,333
LIGHTNING'S ACTIVITIES.
YOU'LL BE A HERO.

207
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,166
- HEY, HARRY. I'M
GLAD I FOUND YOU!

208
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:52,333
- WHY? WHAT'S UP?

209
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,066
- WE'VE JUST BEEN PUTTING ONE
OF THOSE LIGHTNING GUYS

210
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:56,466
THROUGH THE WRINGER...
HE'S TELLING US THAT BRANDON

211
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:59,033
AND BLOOD WAR ARE TRYING
TO KILL EACH OTHER.

212
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,400
- WHAT?

213
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:11,500
- UNBELIEVABLE...

214
00:16:11,566 --> 00:16:14,100
BETRAYED BY MY OWN
LITTLE BROTHER...

215
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,000
DAMN IT. HOW EMBARRASSING!

216
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,300
- I CAN'T AFFORD TO DIE.
NOT HERE.

217
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:29,800
AND NOT AT A TIME LIKE THIS.
THE WAR HAS JUST BEGUN.

218
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:36,633
- BUT THIS IS
A BATTLEFIELD TOO...

219
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,200
- YEAH. IT IS A BATTLEFIELD...

220
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:47,600
- LOOKS LIKE WE GET TO DIE
ON THE BATTLEFIELD AFTER ALL...

221
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,000
ON OUR OWN BATTLEFIELD...

222
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,800
- GUESS SO...

223
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:02,366
I DON'T WANNA DIE
IN A SHITTY PLACE LIKE THIS...

224
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:04,466
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE GETTING
BOSSED AROUND BY SOME

225
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:07,333
GOOD-FOR- NOTHING
SNOT-NOSED PUNK.

226
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,466
- Vulcan: YEAH. THIS
IS NO WAY TO DIE.

227
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:11,833
NO WAY I'M GONNA
LET THAT HAPPEN.

228
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,866
- Blood War: IF I'M GONNA DIE,
I'M GONNA DO IT IN MY WAY.

229
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:19,833
GO OUT IN STYLE WITH
A WHOLE BUNCH OF FIREWORKS!

230
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,833
- Vulcan: AND I'LL BE
RIGHT THERE WITH YOU.

231
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,333
I'LL MAKE THE BULLETS, AND
YOU'LL PULL THE TRIGGER. DEAL?

232
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,066
- ( laughs )

233
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:30,233
- Blood War: SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
SOUNDS LIKE A WHOLE LOT OF FUN.

234
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:34,500
UNTIL THEN, I'M
LEAVING MY PARTNER

235
00:17:34,566 --> 00:17:37,000
WITH YOU, CANNON VULCAN.

236
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,733
- I ACCEPT, BLOOD WAR.

237
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:50,200
I WONDER HOW MANY TIMES
YOU SAVED MY ASS...

238
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,100
- ABOUT AS MANY
AS YOU SAVED MINE...

239
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:03,000
- WE SHOULD HAVE DIED IN THAT
WAR A MILLION TIMES OVER...

240
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:05,866
BUT WE DIDN'T.

241
00:18:24,466 --> 00:18:25,666
- Brandon: BLOOD WAR...

242
00:18:27,766 --> 00:18:29,933
- IS THAT YOU, LITTLE BUDDY?

243
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,200
THAT'S RIGHT...

244
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,900
IT'S NOT OVER YET.

245
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,366
AT THE END,

246
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:44,266
THERE'S GOTTA BE LOTS OF
FIREWORKS, TO GO OUT IN STYLE.

247
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,433
- ( gunshot )

248
00:18:57,033 --> 00:19:01,266
- WHAT THE HELL? HOW COULD
HE JUST GIVE UP LIKE THAT?

249
00:19:02,633 --> 00:19:05,966
- NECROLYZATION...
- WHAT?

250
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:18,366
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

251
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,500
- YO! BRANDON! BUNJI!
- IT'S HARRY!

252
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:34,966
- GET DOWN!

253
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,100
- I THINK IT'S TIME TO GO!
- HE DOESN'T.

254
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,233
- LEE!
- IT'S NOTHING. JUST A SCRATCH.

255
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,933
DON'T WORRY ABOUT
ME, HARRY. JUST MAKE SURE

256
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,833
YOU STAY ALIVE, ALL RIGHT?
FOR YOUR SAKE AND MINE.

257
00:19:57,533 --> 00:19:58,766
- THIS WAY!

258
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,033
- HIS POWER IS AMAZING!

259
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:22,233
- ( roaring )

260
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,233
- HEY, IT'S BEAR WALKEN...

261
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,133
- FOR THE RECORD, THIS
OPERATION WASN'T MY IDEA.

262
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,166
THE REASON WE'RE HERE
IS BECAUSE BIG DADDY

263
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:33,933
ORDERED US TO PROTECT YOU!

264
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,166
- ( growls )

265
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:37,766
- OVERKILLS, FIRE!

266
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,766
WHAT THE...

267
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,666
- UNBELIEVABLE...

268
00:21:14,766 --> 00:21:16,200
-HEY, BRO...

269
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,333
- HOLD ON, BRANDON.

270
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,166
- PROTECT MILLENNION...
I'VE GOT TO PROTECT MILLENNION.

271
00:21:32,033 --> 00:21:33,200
I'M JUST DOING...

272
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,900
MY JOB!

273
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,100
- BRANDON...

274
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,566
- Brandon: I CAN'T HEAR IT...

275
00:22:33,066 --> 00:22:35,666
MARIA'S VOICE,

276
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:39,233
I CAN'T HEAR IT ANY MORE.

277
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,966
- ( pop song playing )

278
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,633
- ( man singing )

279
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,066
- Brandon: WHAT HAVE I ATTAINED
IN THE PAST THREE YEARS,

280
00:24:18,766 --> 00:24:22,033
IS IT HOPE OR IS IT REGRET?

281
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,466
WE RUN AND RUN
AND KEEP ON RUNNING.

282
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:28,433
WITHOUT EVER STOPPING.
