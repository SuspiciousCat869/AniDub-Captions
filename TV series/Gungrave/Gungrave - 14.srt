1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,333
( theme music playing )

2
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,500
- ( inaudible )

3
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,133
- Brandon: I REMEMBER...
THE BLUE SKY.

4
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:58,033
I REMEMBER...
GLOWING CLOUDS.

5
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:03,500
I REMEMBER...
MY FRIEND SHOUTING.

6
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,466
- Harry: I WANNA BE FREE...

7
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:15,333
FREE FROM PAIN...
FREE FROM FEAR...

8
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,966
FREE TO TAKE AS MUCH AS I WANT
AND GIVE AS MUCH AS I WANT.

9
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:28,000
AND SOMEDAY, SOMEHOW,
THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GONNA BE...

10
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:35,666
IN ADDITION, TO THE ONGOING
OPERATIONS MENTIONED EARLIER,

11
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:37,600
WE JUST SIGNED CONTRACTS FOR
A JOINT BUSINESS VENTURE

12
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:41,333
WITH 8 NEW TRADING CORPORATIONS.
SO, THE AMOUNT COMING BACK

13
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,100
TO THE ORGANIZATION WILL BE
5 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES.

14
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,333
- A VERY IMPRESSIVE DEAL, HARRY.

15
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,966
YOU'VE DONE EXCELLENT
WORK AS USUAL.

16
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:51,933
AT THIS RATE, WE WILL BE ABLE
TO FORM PARTNERSHIPS

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,733
WITH ALL THE CORPORATIONS.

18
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,833
- THAT MIGHT BE TOO AMBITIOUS.
RIGHT, BRANDON?

19
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,466
- FOR ANYONE ELSE, IT WOULD BE.

20
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:03,366
- ( laughs ) OH, COME ON.
GET SERIOUS, WILL YOU?

21
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:07,133
- REMEMBER HARRY, THE SUCCESS
OF THE ORGANIZATION WILL

22
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,233
DEPEND ON WORKING IN
HARMONY WITH OUR ALLIES.

23
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,966
THE ORGANIZATION CAN EXIST
ONLY SO LONG AS THE SOCIETY,

24
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:17,533
OF WHICH IT'S A PART,
IS FUNCTIONING SMOOTHLY.

25
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,800
THE USE OF FORCE IS DISRUPTIVE.

26
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,133
SO, BUILD RELATIONSHIPS
THAT ARE MUTUALLY ADVANTAGEOUS.

27
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,466
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
NEVER BETRAY THOSE

28
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:28,433
TO WHOM YOU HAVE
PROMISED LOYALTY.

29
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,166
THE SOCIETY, THE ORGANIZATION
AND THE FAMILY.

30
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:48,733
- OF COURSE.
I'M WELL AWARE OF THAT.

31
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,133
- I'M SORRY. CHALK IT
UP TO AN OLD MAN

32
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,566
FEELING HIS OWN MORTALITY,

33
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,533
LOOKING FOR PEACE OF MIND.

34
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,566
- I'LL BE SURE TO
REMEMBER THAT, BIG DADDY.

35
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,566
- TO THE ORGANIZATION.
- TO THE ORGANIZATION.

36
00:04:04,633 --> 00:04:06,600
- TO THE ORGANIZATION.

37
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:10,700
- Harry: ( sighs )
THIS WINE'S DELICIOUS.

38
00:04:10,766 --> 00:04:13,133
ONLY THE BEST AS USUAL.
- TOKIOKA.

39
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,600
- Big Daddy: WELL,
I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT.

40
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,833
- YOU HAVING FUN, GUYS?
- AH, MARIA.

41
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,466
- HI, MARIA. LONG TIME NO SEE.
- YOUR LOOKING GOOD, HARRY.

42
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:25,733
- THANKS, RIGHT BACK AT YOU...

43
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,700
- IT'S BEEN QUITE A WHILE.
- YEAH.

44
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:34,200
- UH...

45
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,933
- DEAR, WILL YOU TAKE
SOME TIME OFF TODAY?

46
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,433
- YES, THAT'S
THE PLAN, DEAR.

47
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,100
- CAN I TALK TO YOU?
A LITTLE LATER.

48
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,466
- WELL, OF COURSE.
ANYTIME YOU WANT.

49
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,466
- Harry: WHAT THE
HELL WAS THAT ABOUT?

50
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:53,133
SINCE WHEN HAVE THOSE
TWO GOTTEN SO CLOSE?

51
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,800
BRANDON, DOESN'T
THAT BOTHER YOU?

52
00:04:55,866 --> 00:04:57,900
- BIG DADDY FOUNDED
THE ORGANIZATION,

53
00:04:57,966 --> 00:05:01,166
AND HAS DEVOTED HIS
LIFE TO IT, EVER SINCE.

54
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:04,333
NOW, WE SHOULD FREE HIM OF
ANY FURTHER RESPONSIBILITY.

55
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,066
- BRANDON...
- I WANNA HELP,

56
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:09,433
MAKE HER HAPPY AGAIN.

57
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:13,866
- ( grunts ) YOU IDIOT.
DON'T BE SUCH A CHUMP.

58
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,600
- SORRY, BRANDON.

59
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,433
I'M VERY SORRY, REALLY I AM.

60
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,066
BUT I WON'T BE HAVING DINNER
WITH YOU TONIGHT.

61
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:28,833
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I FEEL NAUSEOUS AND DIZZY.

62
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,000
- HMM...

63
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:43,433
- BRANDON, I LOVE HIM. I DO.

64
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,800
I LOVE HIM.

65
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:50,200
I'M SURE IT'S ALL FOR THE BEST,
THAT EVERYTHING TURNED OUT

66
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,566
THE WAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO.

67
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:55,566
I BELIEVE THAT. I'M RIGHT,
AREN'T I, BRANDON?

68
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:58,800
- CONGRATULATIONS, MARIA.

69
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,533
BESIDES, I GOT A LOT
OF WORK TO DO.

70
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,966
- HM?
- IT'S GONNA BE HARD WORK,

71
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,966
CLIMBING UP THE LADDER
WITH HARRY MACDOWEL.

72
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:10,733
AND MAKING HIM THE NEXT
BOSS OF MILLENION, BUT

73
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,766
WE CAN HANDLE IT.
DON'T YOU AGREE?

74
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:18,100
- ( laughs )

75
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,733
YEAH, BRANDON. I AGREE.

76
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:33,066
- Man 1: WHATEVER'S COMING
DOWN MUST BE PRETTY IMPORTANT.

77
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:35,166
I HEAR BIG DADDY'S SENT FOR
EVERY MAJOR PLAYER

78
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:36,366
IN THE FAMILY.

79
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:38,100
- Man 2: ACCORDING TO
THE RUMOR I HEARD,

80
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,566
HE'S GONNA ANNOUNCE WHO
THE NEXT BOSS IS GONNA BE.

81
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:41,700
- Man 3: IT'S ABOUT TIME.

82
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:44,000
WITH NO BLOOD RELATIVES IN
THE ORGANIZATION,

83
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:45,033
HE'S GOT TO PICK
A SUCCESSOR,

84
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,066
WAY IN ADVANCE, YOU KNOW.

85
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:50,700
- Man 2: BET YOU BEAR WALKEN
WILL BE THE NEXT BOSS.

86
00:06:50,766 --> 00:06:54,066
- Man 3: HOW ABOUT THIS MACDOWEL
GUY? COULD HE BE THE ONE?

87
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:57,400
- Man 2: HARRY? YOU CAN'T BE
SERIOUS. HE'S WAY TOO YOUNG.

88
00:06:57,466 --> 00:06:58,900
- Man 1: MAYBE, BUT HE
KNOWS MORE ABOUT

89
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:01,066
MILLENION'S OPERATIONS
THAN ANYONE.

90
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:03,600
AND HE'S GOT POWERFUL
FRIENDS. INCLUDING SOME

91
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,900
OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL
MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY.

92
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:09,066
- Man 3: HE IS ONE SHREWD
FELLA, THAT'S FOR SURE.

93
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:11,633
- Man 2: WHICH IS WHY HE MIGHT
TURN OUT TO BE THE NEXT BOSS

94
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,800
OF THE ORGANIZATION.

95
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,366
- Big Daddy:
THE TIMES HAVE CHANGED.

96
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:21,166
BUT WE, THE MEMBERS OF THE
MILLENION ORGANIZATION

97
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,966
HAVE NOT ALLOWED THE PASSING
YEARS TO WEAKEN OUR RESOLVE.

98
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:28,233
FOR WE HAVE CREATED A
FOUNDATION MADE UNSHAKABLE

99
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,933
BY YOUR SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT.

100
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,466
FORGIVE ME GENTLEMEN, IF I CUT
SHORT THE TRADITIONAL ORATORY.

101
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:38,500
BUT LET'S GET TO THE HEART
OF THE MATTER, SHALL WE?

102
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:42,633
AS SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW,
I ASKED YOU HERE TODAY BECAUSE

103
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,766
VERY SOON NOW,
I WILL OFFER MY RESIGNATION.

104
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,200
IT'S BEEN 35 YEARS SINCE
I ESTABLISHED

105
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:51,700
THE ORGANIZATION
CALLED MILLENNION.

106
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:55,033
THANKS TO YOU, THE LOYAL
MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY

107
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,966
OUR ORGANIZATION HAS GROWN
INTO A SUCCESSFUL ENTERPRISE.

108
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:01,333
AND FOR THAT, I THANK YOU.

109
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,733
HOWEVER I AM NO
LONGER A YOUNG MAN.

110
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,566
AND THEREFORE I AM PASSING
THIS RESPONSIBILITY

111
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:14,733
TO THE COLLEAGUE WHO
IS NEXT IN LINE FOR IT.

112
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,933
- ( all murmuring )

113
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:41,933
MR. ALZAC TINO.
I WANT YOU TO TAKE OVER.

114
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,300
- WHAT? DID I HEAR YOU, RIGHT?

115
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:46,433
DID YOU SAY YOU WANTED
ME TO TAKE OVER?

116
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,533
- IS HE CRAZY?
- HE MUST BE!

117
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,733
- ( all murmuring )

118
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,433
- ( gasps )

119
00:08:58,066 --> 00:09:00,600
- ( Harry applauding )

120
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,666
- HEY BRO, WHAT'S SHAKIN'?

121
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:46,666
- HE DECIDED ON ALZAC TINO
AS A SUCCESSOR.

122
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:49,766
WHICH I ADMIT,
IS A REASONABLE DECISION.

123
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:53,866
YOU ALREADY KNEW?
BUT YOU COULDN'T UNLESS...

124
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,333
- HMM...
- HEY, I ONLY DID IT 'CAUSE

125
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,933
WE ALL WANTED TO BE LISTENING
WHEN BIG DADDY SAID,

126
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,766
THAT YOU WERE GONNA BE
THE NEW BOSS, BUT THEN...

127
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,666
- BUT THEN, HARRY MACDOWEL
WAS EMBARRASSED

128
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:06,966
TO LEARN HE'S A LOSER.

129
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:08,933
- STOP THAT.

130
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,200
- NICE CANS, BOB. SOUNDS
LIKE A REAL STUDIO IN HERE.

131
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:20,733
- Big Daddy: NOW, TELL ME
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM?

132
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,100
ESPECIALLY WHETHER OR
NOT YOU FEEL HE'S WORTH

133
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,133
CONSIDERING FOR
THE TOP POSITION.

134
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,533
- Brandon: I THINK SO.
- BIG DADDY AND BRANDON...

135
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,500
- I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN, EVERYONE
EXPECTED HARRY MACDOWEL

136
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:32,366
WOULD BE MY CHOICE,

137
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:35,033
AS THE NEXT BOSS OF MILLENION.

138
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,266
BUT HE'S NOT. I SURPRISED THEM
AND CHOSE ALZAC INSTEAD.

139
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,333
ANY OBJECTION TO THAT?

140
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,566
- THAT'S IRRELEVANT, SIR.

141
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:48,833
- YOU SEE, VERY TALENTED GUYS
LIKE HARRY, HAVE NATURAL GIFTS

142
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,833
WHICH ALLOW THEM TO SUCCEED
WITHOUT MUCH EFFORT.

143
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,600
THEY WORK AS LITTLE AS THEY CAN,
AND LOOK FOR SHORTCUTS.

144
00:10:55,666 --> 00:11:00,400
SHORTCUTS WORRY ME. NOT THAT
HARRY ISN'T DOING A FINE JOB.

145
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:03,933
THE GROWTH OF THE ORGANIZATION
LATELY IS DUE MAINLY TO HARRY.

146
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,333
HE'S CERTAINLY QUALIFIED
TO BE MILLENION'S NEXT BOSS.

147
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,233
NOR DO I QUESTION HIS LOYALTY.

148
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,200
BUT SOMETHING IN MY GUT,

149
00:11:13,266 --> 00:11:17,833
TELLS ME TO BE AWARE OF AN
UNKNOWN DANGER. A HIDDEN THREAT.

150
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:23,333
I PROMISE YOU THIS, IF HARRY
MACDOWEL DOES ANY DAMAGE

151
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,766
TO THIS ORGANIZATION,

152
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,100
HE'LL REGRET...

153
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,933
- HARRY IS NOT A TRAITOR
AND HE NEVER WILL BE.

154
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
YOU'VE GOT MY WORD.

155
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,766
- ( chuckles )

156
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,300
- HOWEVER, EACH AND EVERY
TRAITOR WHO BREAKS

157
00:11:35,366 --> 00:11:36,800
THE CODE OF IRON,
WILL RECEIVE

158
00:11:36,866 --> 00:11:39,766
THE SAME PUNISHMENT.
NO MORE, NO LESS.

159
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:44,566
REGARDLESS OF RANK OR STATUS.
NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE.

160
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:45,600
- ( gasps )

161
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,366
THOSE ARE THE RULES
YOU ASK THE MEMBERS

162
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:53,766
OF THIS ORGANIZATION TO LIVE BY,

163
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,766
AND I DO SO,
TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY.

164
00:11:56,833 --> 00:12:01,200
MY DUTY IS TO KILL TRAITORS,
WHENEVER AND WHEREVER

165
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:07,366
I FIND THEM, NO MATTER
WHO THEY ARE.

166
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:10,566
- HARRY, IS THERE
SOMETHING THE MATTER?

167
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,300
- HEY BRO, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

168
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:17,500
- NOTHING, GUYS. NOTHING AT ALL.

169
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:19,966
- SO, DID YOU
HEAR ANYTHING, HARRY?

170
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:23,100
- YEAH, YOU MIGHT SAY THAT.
- HMM, WHAT?

171
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,100
- SHE WAS HOT WHOEVER SHE WAS.

172
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,566
SHE WAS COMPLETELY
OUT OF CONTROL.

173
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:29,366
( laughs )

174
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,633
- All: HMM?

175
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:44,033
- Harry: HEY.
- Brandon: HEY HARRY, WHAT'S UP?

176
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,833
YOU GOT SOME TIME TO KILL,

177
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,133
BEFORE YOU SHOW UP
AT THAT MEETING?

178
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,733
- Harry: YEAH, A WHILE ANYWAY.
HANG OUT WITH ME, WILL YA?

179
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,500
WE'RE BOTH SO BUSY ALL THE TIME.

180
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:55,466
LET'S TAKE A LITTLE TIME OFF,
FOR A CHANGE. WHAT DO YOU SAY?

181
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:00,466
- Brandon: YOU'RE RIGHT.
THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

182
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:04,966
- SO, HOW'S SHERRY DOING?
- JUST FINE.

183
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:08,000
SHE REALLY SEEMS TO BE
ENJOYING HERSELF AT SCHOOL.

184
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:09,233
BUT HER RELATIONSHIP
WITH HER FATHER

185
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,466
ISN'T GETTING ANY
BETTER, LATELY.

186
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:13,700
- BECAUSE YOU AND
SHERRY ARE TOGETHER?

187
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:16,000
- HOPE NOT. BRANDON,
LET ME GET YOU A DATE

188
00:13:16,066 --> 00:13:18,466
AND THE FOUR OF US CAN
DOUBLE, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

189
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,700
YESTERDAY, THEY TOOK ALZAC
TO THE HOSPITAL.

190
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:34,333
- ( gasps )

191
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,033
- HE'S CRITICAL, I HEAR.

192
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,700
THREE MONTHS AFTER
HE TOOK OVER.

193
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:41,466
POOR GUY DESERVED
BETTER, YOU KNOW.

194
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:45,233
( scoffs ) GUESS HE
RAN OUT OF LUCK.

195
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,900
♪ RAIN, HERE COMES THE RAIN ♪

196
00:14:19,966 --> 00:14:23,600
♪ HERE COMES THE RAIN ♪

197
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:27,366
♪ RIGHT FROM THE
MOMENT I MET YOU ♪

198
00:14:30,766 --> 00:14:36,100
♪ I KNEW THAT I
COULD NEVER FORGET ♪

199
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,266
- HARRY, IT'S BEEN A WHILE
WANNA GO SAY "HELLO?"

200
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,033
- WHO TO? HUH?
- FRIENDS OF OURS.

201
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,400
- I MEAN KENNY AND THE OTHERS.
- KENNY?

202
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:47,400
- ( gasps )

203
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:51,500
- OH! OF COURSE! NO PROBLEM!
SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

204
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:06,200
COME TO THINK OF IT,
I DID PROMISE THOSE GUYS

205
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:07,833
ONCE WE CLIMB THE
LADDER, WE'D COME BACK

206
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,800
AND BUILD THEM THE
MOST SPECTACULAR

207
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:12,500
GRAVES THIS TOWN HAS
EVER SEEN. REMEMBER?

208
00:15:12,566 --> 00:15:16,266
HELL, I CAN AFFORD THE
WHOLE CEMETERY NOW.

209
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,833
- I'LL JUST GIVE THEM THE
CASH AND THEY CAN START

210
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,900
BUILDING THE NEW
GRAVES FOR THESE...

211
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:20,933
- HARRY...

212
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:03,700
- HASN'T CHANGED A BIT.
TAKES YOU BACK, DOESN'T IT?

213
00:16:03,766 --> 00:16:05,600
- YEAH...

214
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,966
- GUESS SHE'S THE ONE WHO
RUNS THE ORPHANAGE NOW,

215
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:23,566
INSTEAD OF THAT OLD
BASTARD WE HATED SO MUCH.

216
00:16:45,066 --> 00:16:48,833
THERE WAS THAT ONE TIME,
REMEMBER THAT?

217
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,633
- YEAH.

218
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:58,266
- Harry: THE WIND WAS
REALLY STRONG THAT DAY.

219
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:03,866
THAT SHEET JUMPED OFF THE
CLOTHES LINE LIKE IT HAD

220
00:17:03,933 --> 00:17:05,633
A WILL OF IT'S OWN.

221
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:09,166
IT STARTED FLYING AROUND,
LIKE IT WAS ALIVE.

222
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,100
WE RAN AND RAN AND RAN.

223
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,266
CHASING THAT SHEET,

224
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,733
DETERMINED TO FOLLOW IT,
NO MATTER HOW FAR WE HAD TO GO.

225
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:21,100
IN SEARCH OF FREEDOM.

226
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,533
IN SEARCH OF FREEDOM.

227
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,166
HIGHER...
HIGHER...

228
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,933
AND THEN THAT MEAN OLD BASTARD
BEAT THE HELL OUT OF US

229
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,800
FOR PLAYING WITH
THE DAMN LAUNDRY.

230
00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:38,933
- HE WAS TOUGH ON BOTH OF US...

231
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,733
- WISH HE WAS ALIVE. WOULD
HAVE BEEN FUN TO PAY HIM BACK

232
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,966
FOR WHAT HE DID
TO US, BACK THEN.

233
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:45,733
- ( starts engine )

234
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,633
- YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA
BUY THE WHOLE DAMN ORPHANAGE.

235
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,666
THEN I'LL BUILD THE TOWN
A BRAND NEW ONE.

236
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:27,766
- ( whirring )

237
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:30,166
- THE BOSS HAS GOT TO DIE.

238
00:19:30,233 --> 00:19:31,633
- ( gasps )

239
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,600
- I'VE ACQUIRED SOMETHING.

240
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:41,766
SO POWERFUL THAT WE CAN
CONTROL THIS ENTIRE CITY.

241
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,466
NO, SOMETHING EVEN BIGGER.

242
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:48,733
BIG DADDY IS JUST
A FEEBLE OLD MAN,

243
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,333
WHOSE DECIDED HE'S OUTLIVED
HIS USEFULNESS.

244
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,266
YET HIS INFLUENCE
IS UNDIMINISHED.

245
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,766
HE WON'T GET OUT OF THE WAY.

246
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:01,066
NOT TO MENTION THAT WITHOUT
BIG DADDY AROUND...

247
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:04,466
MARIA WILL BE YOURS
FOR THE TAKING.

248
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,166
- ( grunts )

249
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,400
- ( gun clatters )

250
00:20:45,466 --> 00:20:48,366
- ( Brandon whimpering )

251
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,766
- BRANDON...

252
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,166
- ( gasps )

253
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,933
( shouting ) BRANDON!

254
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:27,133
- Brandon: I REMEMBER...
THE BLUE SKY.

255
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:34,166
I REMEMBER...
GLOWING CLOUDS.

256
00:22:35,566 --> 00:22:37,466
I REMEMBER...

257
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,000
- ( pop song playing )

258
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,966
- ( man singing )

259
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:19,300
- Brandon: BRANDON HEAT
DIED, AND A DARK,

260
00:24:19,366 --> 00:24:22,400
GRITTY WIND SWEPT
OVER MILLENNION.

261
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:25,600
IS FEELING SMOTHERED
BY THE VERY AIR WE BREATHE,

262
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,633
A SIGN OF THINGS TO COME?
