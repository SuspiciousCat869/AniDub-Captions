1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,933
- ( collar jingles )

2
00:00:41,266 --> 00:00:43,166
- ( footsteps approaching )

3
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,533
- BEYOND THE GRAVE.

4
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,600
NO.

5
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:33,433
BRANDON HEAT...

6
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,466
YOU PATHETIC BASTARD.

7
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:59,866
YOU LOOK MORE DEAD
THAN ALIVE.

8
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:02,466
BUT YOU'RE NOT,
THANKS TO DR. TOKIOKA.

9
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:04,400
HE NECROLIZED YOU,
DIDN'T HE?

10
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:05,800
- YEAH.

11
00:02:05,866 --> 00:02:07,300
- WHO THE HELL
ASKED HIM TO? 

12
00:02:07,366 --> 00:02:09,166
HE SHOULD HAVE
STAYED OUT OF IT.

13
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:11,966
- THAT WAS MY CHOICE.

14
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:15,500
I ASKED HIM TO
BEFORE I WAS KILLED.

15
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:18,966
- BIG DADDY TOLD ME 
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU

16
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:20,966
BEFORE HE LEFT US.

17
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:22,500
AND THAT WAS WHEN

18
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:25,433
I LEARNED THAT YOU KNEW
EVERYTHING I'D DONE

19
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,433
IN ORDER TO CLIMB
THE LADDER TO THE TOP.

20
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,066
- THAT'S RIGHT!

21
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:32,600
I DID WHATEVER 
HAD TO BE DONE!

22
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,600
GOT RID OF ANYONE
IN MY WAY

23
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,966
TO GET ANOTHER STEP
UP THE LADDER.

24
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:39,066
RANDY AND THEN ALZAC

25
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:41,566
EVEN BIG DADDY.

26
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:43,566
AND THEN IN SECRET,
I FUNDED THE RESEARCH

27
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:45,200
THAT LED TO NECROLIZATION.

28
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:47,066
AND YOU WERE WATCHING
EVERY MOVE I MADE

29
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,100
AND NEVER TOLD ME!

30
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,966
( sighs )

31
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:55,533
YOU WERE THE SAME WAY
AS A KID, YOU KNOW?

32
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,333
YOU HAVEN'T
CHANGED A BIT.

33
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,000
ALWAYS CALM,

34
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:01,333
ALWAYS READY TO
FOLLOW MY LEAD.

35
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,966
ALWAYS THERE IF I NEEDED YOU.

36
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:05,466
- DID YOU THINK
I WAS A FOOL

37
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,466
FOR BEING SO AMBITIOUS?

38
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:10,200
THAT I WAS JUST LIKE ALL
THE OTHER COCKY YOUNG PUNKS

39
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:12,866
TRYING DESPERATELY
TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE?

40
00:03:14,866 --> 00:03:17,333
- WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOOT ME
WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE? 

41
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,033
YOU HAD EVERY RIGHT TO KILL ME 
FOR BETRAYING THE ORGANIZATION,

42
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,233
BUT YOU CHOSE NOT TO.

43
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,400
WHY?

44
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,366
- I THOUGHT YOU WOULD
BECOME THE BOSS OF MILLENNION.

45
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:31,400
- WHO, ME?

46
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:34,533
I'M THAT AND MORE.

47
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,566
I CONTROL
THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION

48
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,566
AND THE ENTIRE CITY AS WELL.

49
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:40,900
AND EVERYONE DOES
AS THEY'RE TOLD. 

50
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:42,433
IF I SAY BLACK IS WHITE,

51
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,233
THEN FROM NOW ON,
IT'S WHITE.

52
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,566
IT'S MINE, ALL OF IT.

53
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:48,066
I CAN TAKE WHAT I WANT
AND GIVE WHAT I WANT. 

54
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:49,733
- NO, YOU'RE WRONG.

55
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,566
MILLENNION'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

56
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:54,133
- MILLENNION IS WHATEVER
THE BOSS SAYS IT IS,

57
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,433
AND THAT'S ME.

58
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,933
- IT'S A BETRAYAL.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,533
- YOU'RE THE TRAITOR,

60
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,533
NOT ME.

61
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:08,133
( chuckles )

62
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,300
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.

63
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,933
WE CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST,

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,400
BUT WE CAN CELEBRATE
OUR REUNION WITH A DRINK.

65
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,300
IT'S A 43-YEAR-OLD BOURBON
CALLED "TIAN SATTY."

66
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:22,033
IT WAS MADE
THE YEAR WE WERE BORN.

67
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,966
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
MAKES IT SO GOOD.

68
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:25,833
WELL?
( chuckles )

69
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,766
BOTTOMS UP.

70
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:32,633
AHH.

71
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,266
THAT'S GOOD.

72
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,633
HAVE SOME.

73
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,233
I REMEMBER THE TIME
I ASKED BIG DADDY

74
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,566
IF HE'D LIKE TO TRY
A LITTLE TASTE OF THIS STUFF.

75
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:50,233
BUT BIG DADDY SAID BOURBON'S 
JUST A DERIVATIVE OF WHISKEY.

76
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,100
WHY BOTHER WHEN YOU CAN HAVE
THE GENUINE ARTICLE?

77
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,433
IN OTHER WORDS,
I'M BOURBON,

78
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,433
AND HE'S WHISKEY.

79
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,600
AM I BIG DADDY'S DERIVATIVE?

80
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,566
A WATERED DOWN VERSION
OF THE REAL THING?

81
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,933
HOW DARE HE ACT
SO HIGH AND MIGHTY.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,066
HE COMMITS GOD KNOWS
HOW MANY CRIMES

83
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:11,333
TO GET TO THE TOP,

84
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,800
AND THEN STARTS PREACHING
PEACE AND HARMONY,

85
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:17,633
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYBODY
THINKS HE'S SOME KIND OF SAINT.

86
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,533
THE OLD FART WAS
NOTHING BUT A HYPOCRITE,

87
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,866
FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.

88
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:23,333
- YOU'RE WRONG.

89
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,000
- HMM?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

90
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:27,400
- BIG DADDY KNEW

91
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:30,066
THAT HE HAD DONE A LOT OF
BAD THINGS IN THIS LIFE.

92
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:32,700
HE WAS AWARE OF
HIS OWN WEAKNESSES.

93
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:37,600
THAT'S WHY HARMONY AND ORDER
WERE SO IMPORTANT TO HIM.

94
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,933
AND WHY HE FELT
THEY WERE THE KEY...

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,566
TO MILLENNION'S FUTURE.

96
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,133
- I HATE IT.

97
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,700
I HATE THE THOUGHT
OF YOU BEING DUPED

98
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,666
INTO BELIEVING
THAT OLD FART'S BULLSHIT!

99
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:55,033
HE ROBBED ME.

100
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,933
STOLE THE MOST IMPORTANT 
THING IN MY LIFE FROM ME.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,100
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!

102
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,066
WHAT HE STOLE
WAS IRREPLACEABLE!

103
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:02,933
HE'S ABOUT TO LEARN
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE,

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,933
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M GONNA STEAL FROM HIM?!

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,233
EVERYTHING HE'S GOT!

106
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:13,200
- ( chuckles )

107
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,900
( blows )

108
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:34,266
WERE WE WRONG, BRANDON?

109
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,200
DID WE MAKE THE WRONG
DECISION AFTER ALL?

110
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,033
I CAN'T SEEM TO REMEMBER

111
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,700
WHEN THINGS STARTED TO
TAKE A TURN FOR THE WORSE.

112
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,533
EITHER WAY, IN THE END, 
IT TURNED OUT LIKE THIS.

113
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:54,700
BUT NOW THAT THE PIECES
ARE BROKEN APART,

114
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:56,600
THEY CAN'T BE
PUT BACK TOGETHER.

115
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,566
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
BRANDON?

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,100
- ( gasps )

117
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,400
- YOU RECOGNIZE IT,
DON'T YOU?

118
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,666
SURE.
OF COURSE YOU DO.

119
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:07,800
THIS IS YOUR GUN.

120
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:11,033
THE ONE YOU WERE GONNA
USE TO KILL ME.

121
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,366
AND THIS...

122
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:16,366
IS THE ONE I USED
TO KILL YOU.

123
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:18,133
- WHY?

124
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,100
- OH, AS MEMENTOS,
I SUPPOSE.

125
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:25,800
( sighs )

126
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:27,766
LET'S SETTLE
THE OLD SCORE.

127
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,266
- ( guns cock )

128
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,466
- ( chuckles )

129
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:43,166
I'LL KILL YOU
ALL OVER AGAIN.

130
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,466
KILL YOU ONCE
AND FOR ALL! 

131
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,100
- ( gunshot )

132
00:07:52,066 --> 00:07:53,133
- ( groans )

133
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:56,133
( grunts )

134
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:58,400

( panting )
- ( groans )

136
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,100
- ( chuckles )

137
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,600
OH, HOW THE MIGHTY
HAVE FALLEN.

138
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,566
AND NOW,
I'M A WANTED MAN.

139
00:08:14,633 --> 00:08:15,966
- SEND US EVERYONE YOU'VE GOT.

140
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,966
- ( guns cock )

141
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:32,433

- ( groans )

147
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:59,333
- HMM?
- ( grunts )

148
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,600
- ( gasps )

149

- ( chuckles )
- ( shudders )

150

- ( gunshots )

151
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,633
- ( gasps )

152
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,233

- BRANDON.

166
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:55,200
BRANDON, WHY ARE YOU...

167
00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:56,533
PROTECTING ME?

168
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,833
WHY ARE YOU HELPING ME?

169
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,466
TELL ME WHY!

170
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:03,800
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH THOSE TWO.

171
00:10:03,866 --> 00:10:05,133
IF GRAVE CAME HERE
TO KILL HIM,

172
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,466
WHY'S HE PROTECTING THE GUY?

173
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:07,800
- DOESN'T MATTER.

174
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:09,800
WE'RE GONNA
KILL THEM BOTH ANYWAY.

175
00:10:09,866 --> 00:10:11,633
HEY, GUYS.
MAKE SURE YOU'RE USING

176
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,166
THAT ANTI-NECROLIZER AMMO.

177
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:16,966
- ALL RIGHT.  UNDERSTOOD.

178
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,233
- ( phone beeps )

179
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,500
- YOUNG LADY,

180
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:22,100
BRANDON HEAT'S LOCATION 
HAS JUST BEEN CONFIRMED.

181
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,100
- THAT'S WONDERFUL.
WHERE IS HE?

182
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,300
- HE'S IN THE SLUM

183
00:10:25,366 --> 00:10:27,200
ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF
THE WEST DISTRICT. 

184
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:29,866
- PLEASE, TAKE ME THERE.
HE NEEDS MY HELP.

185
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:31,800
- WE CAN'T DO THAT.
- WHY NOT?

186
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:32,933
- HE'S NOT ALONE.

187
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,800
BRANDON HEAT IS WITH
HARRY MACDOWEL.

188
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:37,000
- ( gasps )
- MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION

189
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:39,000
HAVE THE AREA
COMPLETELY SURROUNDED.

190
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:42,866
AND THEIR ORDERS ARE
TO EXECUTE BOTH OF THEM.

191
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,200
- NO WAY!

192
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:45,533
OH, PLEASE.

193
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,000
PLEASE, STOP THEM!
- IMPOSSIBLE.

194
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:49,333
- YOU'VE GOT TO.

195
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,533
- I CAN'T.

196
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,866
- PLEASE, SIR!
I BEG YOU.

197
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:52,866
- THE ANSWER IS NO!

198
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:54,333
- ( gasps )

199
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,300
( cries )

200
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,800
( panting )

201
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:03,700
- LET HER GO.

202
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:05,166
- EVEN IF SHE GETS THERE,

203
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:06,900
THERE'S NOTHING
SHE CAN DO.

204
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,400
THEIR DESTINY
HAS ALREADY BEEN DECIDED.

205
00:11:15,766 --> 00:11:17,000
- ( gunfire )

206
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:28,566
( gunfire continues )

207
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:31,400
- HUH?
- ( gunfire )

208
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:32,766
- AAH!

209
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,366
- ( grunts )

210
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:35,733
( grunts )

211
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,166
- ( men gasp )
- ( groans )

212
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:41,200
- ( gunfire )
- ( screaming )

213
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:44,066
- ( men shouting )
- FALL BACK!

214
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:45,766
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!

215
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,066
- ( groans )

216
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,400
- HARRY?

217
00:11:50,466 --> 00:11:52,466
- THEY FINALLY GOT ME.

218
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,733
EVER SINCE THE FIRST JOB
I EVER PULLED,

219
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,733
I'VE BEEN PROUD OF THE FACT

220
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,533
THAT I'VE NEVER
TAKEN A BULLET.

221
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,733
( chuckles )

222
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,066
BUT I GUESS MY LUCK
JUST RAN OUT.

223
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:07,700
( groans )

224
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:19,000
- BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY,
RIGHT?

225
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:24,400
- ( groans )

226
00:12:24,466 --> 00:12:25,700
- ( gun cocks )

227
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,766
- TAKES ME BACK...

228
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,066
TO THE DAYS
WE USED TO LIVE HERE.

229
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:40,600
I CAN STILL SMELL
JOLICE'S COOKING.

230
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,500
HE WAS ONE HELL OF
A COOK, WASN'T HE?

231
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:45,466
- KENNY, NATHAN,

232
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:47,133
AND JOLICE.

233
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,333
THOSE WERE THE DAYS.

234
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,800
SURE, IT WAS HARD 
TO MAKE ENDS MEET,

235
00:12:50,866 --> 00:12:53,366
BUT IT WAS SO MUCH FUN.

236
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:55,133
- ( chuckles )

237
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,800
WE'RE BACK TOGETHER
AFTER SUCH A LONG TIME.

238
00:12:57,866 --> 00:12:59,566
SO WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE DOING THIS FOR?

239
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,966
- BRANDON!
- ( sighs )

240
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:07,966
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING WAY OVER THERE?

241
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:09,633
COME JOIN US.

242
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,966
YOU TOO, HARRY.

243
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:13,166
- HURRY UP.
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

244
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:15,166
- HOLD ON, CHILL OUT.

245
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:17,500
I'VE STILL GOT
A LOT TO TALK ABOUT...

246
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:19,166
WITH MY BUDDY HERE.

247
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:20,833
- SAVE IT.  I MEAN,
YOU DON'T WANT TO

248
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,066
KEEP HER WAITING,
DO YOU?

249
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:23,500
- HUH?

250
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,033
MARIA?

251
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:31,066
- BRANDON.

252
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,166
THANK YOU.

253
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:41,366
THANK YOU FOR
PROTECTING MIKA.

254
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:43,700
- SORRY, BRANDON,

255
00:13:43,766 --> 00:13:45,933
FOR CAUSING YOU
ALL THAT TROUBLE.

256
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:49,200
- Maria: BRANDON.

257
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:52,033
- Big Daddy: BRANDON.

258
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,166
- ( groans )

259
00:13:56,266 --> 00:13:58,800
BY THE WAY,
I ASKED YOU A QUESTION BEFORE

260
00:13:58,866 --> 00:14:01,866
AND YOU NEVER ANSWERED IT.

261
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:04,966
WHY ARE YOU TRYING
TO HELP ME?

262
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:06,866
I THOUGHT...

263
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:09,466
THAT YOU CAME BACK HERE
TO KILL ME.

264
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:12,400
ISN'T THAT WHY
YOU CAME BACK FROM THE GRAVE?

265
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:13,866
FOR REVENGE?

266
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:16,833
( grunts )

267
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:21,633
I SENT THE TEAM
THAT KILLED MARIA,

268
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,966
THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.

269
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:24,966
I KILLED BIG DADDY,

270
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:26,300
AND YOU LOVED HIM TOO.

271
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,300
YOU HAVE EVERY REASON
TO HATE ME.

272
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:29,633
I'M YOUR ENEMY, RIGHT?

273
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,300
- ( grunts )

274
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:32,966
- COME ON, BRANDON.
HERE I AM,

275
00:14:33,033 --> 00:14:34,100
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

276
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,900
USE THAT GUN OF YOURS.

277
00:14:35,966 --> 00:14:38,033
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

278
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,233
YOU MOCKING ME,
YOU SON OF A BITCH?!

279
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,900
SAY SOMETHING!

280
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:43,866
( groans )

281
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:51,500
( chuckles )

282
00:14:51,566 --> 00:14:54,066
I KNOW.
IT'S MY FAULT, NOT YOURS.

283
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:56,033
( sighs )

284
00:14:58,133 --> 00:14:59,400
LEE AND BOB.

285
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:00,866
BEAR AND BUNJI.

286
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,800
ORGMEN AND I
INVESTED SO MUCH TIME

287
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:04,600
AND MONEY IN... GONE.

288
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:05,933
ALL GONE.

289
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,900
SHERRY TOO.

290
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:13,233
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING LEFT.

291
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,900
KILL ME.

292
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:20,566
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE
IN DISGRACE ANYMORE.

293
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:23,800
KILL ME, BRANDON.

294
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:26,966
I'M...

295
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:28,233
BEGGING YOU.

296
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:32,100
KILL ME!

297
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,733
- ( gasps )

298
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,233
- ( grunts )
- ( explosion )

299
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,100
- ( gasps )

300
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,933
( panting )

301
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:44,633
WHAT WAS THAT?

302
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,933
- ( car horn honking )

303
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:50,066
- YOUNG LADY,
GET IN THE CAR.

304
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,966
- HARRY.

305
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:54,300
HARRY.

306
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:55,366
( sighs )

307
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:57,300
FOREVER.

308
00:15:57,366 --> 00:15:58,600
MY LOVE.

309
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,333
HARRY.

310
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:06,766
- SHERRY.

311
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:13,833
- TAKE CARE OF MY DAUGHTER,
HARRY MACDOWEL.

312
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,633
- I WILL, DAD.

313
00:16:18,066 --> 00:16:20,666
- ( chews )
THIS'LL DO IT, ALL RIGHT,

314
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:22,000
IF WE USE THIS
PIECE OF INFO 

315
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:23,333
TO BLACKMAIL THEM.

316
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,000
- WE CAN TAKE OVER THEIR
SOUTHPORT DISTRIBUTION ROUTES.

317
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:28,000
THE WHOLE DISTRICT
WILL BELONG TO US.

318
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:29,333
- THAT'S ABOUT IT.

319
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,333
- THAT'S BRILLIANT, BOB.
BRILLIANT.

320
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,500
- OF COURSE,
IT MIGHT GET UGLY,

321
00:16:33,566 --> 00:16:35,633
CONSIDERING WHO
WE'RE DEALING WITH.

322
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,366
- HEY, NO PROBLEM, BIG GUY.

323
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:41,033
YOU CAN LEAVE 'EM TO ME.
I CAN'T WAIT.

324
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,366
- Harry: GOOD.
I'M COUNTING ON YOU, BUNJI.

325
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:45,700
YOU TOO, BRANDON.

326
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:47,333
- YEAH.

327
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:49,666

329
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,933

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,366
BRANDON.
