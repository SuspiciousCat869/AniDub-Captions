1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,900
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,466
- Female Announcer:
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY BROADCAST

3
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:49,566
FROM THE MILLENNION
ORGANIZATION.

4
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:50,833
MR. BRANDON HEAT,

5
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,200
WE HAVE YOUR COMPANION,
MISS MIKA ASAGI, IN CUSTODY.

6
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:56,233
YOUR IMMEDIATE PRESENCE
IS REQUIRED AT

7
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,066
SOUTHPORT STATION'S UNDERGROUND
PLATFORM NUMBER THREE.

8
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:00,900
- DON'T BE IMPATIENT, GRAVE.

9
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:02,900
- MR. HEAT, SHOULD YOU
FAIL TO APPEAR...

10
00:02:02,966 --> 00:02:06,266
- IT WON'T TAKE LONG.
I NEED JUST A LITTLE MORE TIME.

11
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,933
JUST TWO OR THREE HOURS,

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,566
AND YOUR BODY WILL BE
IN OPTIMUM CONDITION.

13
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:14,300
I KNOW WHERE THE YOUNG LADY
IS BEING HELD.

14
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:16,466
THOSE ARROGANT
MILLENNION BASTARDS

15
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:19,800
WENT TO THE TROUBLE
OF MAKING SURE WE'D KNOW.

16
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:23,300
THIS TIME IT WON'T BE
LIKE IT WAS BEFORE.

17
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:25,833
THIS IS GOING TO BE
THE ULTIMATE SHOOTOUT.

18
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,633
ALL THE MORE REASON WHY
THE ABILITIES OF BRANDON HEAT,

19
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,733
THE FORMER SWEEPER
OF MILLENNION,

20
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,733
AND THE ABILITIES OF THE
NECROLIZER, BEYOND THE GRAVE...

21
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,400
BOTH NEED TO BE MAXIMIZED.

22
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,066
PLEASE.

23
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:47,300
DON'T LET ME BE THE CAUSE OF
MORE SUFFERING AND PAIN.

24
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:00,766
- WHERE-- WHERE AM I?

25
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,533
- THIS IS MILLENNION
CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS.

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,900
- ( gasps slightly )

27
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:08,566
- ( chuckles )
MISS MIKA ASAGI.

28
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:10,266
HOW NICE OF YOU TO JOIN US.

29
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,200
- SO YOU'RE BALLADBIRD LEE,
RIGHT?

30
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:15,333
( gasps )
HEY, WHAT DID YOU DO TO THEM?!

31
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,800
TO THOSE TWO OLD MEN?!

32
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:19,366
- HA.  WHAT ARE YOU
ASKING ME FOR?

33
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,666
YOU WERE THERE, MISS.

34
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,166
YOU SAW ME CUT THEM
INTO PIECES, DIDN'T YOU?

35
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:24,400
- ( gasps )

36
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:30,500
THAT WAS... INHUMAN!

37
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:32,666
- ACTUALLY, YOU'RE QUITE
CORRECT, YOUNG LADY.

38
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:35,333
FOR YOU SEE,
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

39
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,366
THAT I'M NOT HUMAN ANYMORE.
NOT REALLY.

40
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:39,333
- ( whimpers )
- ( door opens )

41
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,133
- ( gasps )
- SO... SHE'S THE ONE.

42
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:47,666
- ( footsteps approaching )
- HOW DO YOU DO, YOUNG LADY?

43
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:49,566
- BLOODY HARRY!

44
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:50,666
- WELL NOW,

45
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:53,633
I GUESS IT WON'T BE NECESSARY
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

46
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,366
- YOU KILLED MY MOTHER
AND MR. TOKIOKA!

47
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:57,933
- AND YOUR FATHER AS WELL.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,533
- ( gasps )

49
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,800
- OF COURSE IN YOUR FATHER'S
CASE, I DID IT MYSELF.

50
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:05,933
- I WON'T FORGIVE YOU.

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,066
I'LL NEVER EVER FORGIVE YOU!

52
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:10,733
- MISS ASAGI, BEFORE YOU START
YELLING YOUR HEAD OFF,

53
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,566
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND
YOUR SITUATION.

54
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:15,766
AT THE MOMENT,
YOU ARE IN OUR CUSTODY.

55
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:19,066
AND THAT MEANS I CAN END
YOUR EXISTENCE WHENEVER I LIKE.

56
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,600
UNDERSTAND?

57
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,433
- ( gasps )

58
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,700
( whimpers )

59
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:31,733
NO!

60
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,266
PLEASE HELP ME.

61
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,633
PLEASE, GRAVE.

62
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,266
- WHAT DID YOU CALL HIM?

63
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,666
- I CALLED HIM GRAVE.

64
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:40,166
HE WAS BRANDON HEAT.

65
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:42,033
NOW HE'S BEYOND THE GRAVE.

66
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,133
- GRAVE, YOU SAY.

67
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,800
( chuckles )

68
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:48,766
MY, WHAT AN IMPRESSIVE NAME.

69
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,766
THEN IT WOULD PROBABLY BE
MUCH MORE APPROPRIATE FOR ME

70
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,966
TO CALL HIM BEYOND THE GRAVE
AS WELL.

71
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:56,566
BESIDES, I WOULDN'T
WANNA CALL HIM BRANDON.

72
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:59,766
IT WOULD ONLY MAKE ME REMEMBER
THE WAY THINGS USED TO BE.

73
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,533
- HE WILL COME, MISS.

74
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,033
WE'VE TOLD HIM
WHERE TO FIND YOU,

75
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,200
AND I'M SURE HE'LL GET HERE
AS FAST AS HE CAN.

76
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:07,466
HE REALLY HAS NO CHOICE
IN THE MATTER.

77
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:08,666
AND WHEN HE SHOWS UP,

78
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:11,033
THAT'S WHEN I'LL FINALLY
TAKE MY REVENGE.

79
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,500
- YOUR REVENGE?

80
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:17,300
- FOR MY FRIEND--
MY BEST FRIEND, BOB POUNDMAX.

81
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:18,866
GRAVE WAS THE ONE
WHO KILLED HIM,

82
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:21,466
SO NOW I'M GOING
TO RETURN THE FAVOR.

83
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:23,466
( laughs )

84
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:25,633
BUT BEFORE I DO,
I'LL MAKE HIM WATCH

85
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,500
AS I CUT YOU TO PIECES.

86
00:05:27,566 --> 00:05:30,000
I'LL SHATTER HIS HEART
AND THEN HIS BODY,

87
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:32,133
BUT SLOWLY,
A LITTLE AT A TIME...

88
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,300
TILL HE'S NOTHING MORE
THAN A BLOODY OFFERING

89
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:36,300
FOR THE WORMS TO GORGE ON.

90
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,700
- WERE WE TOO LATE?

91
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:48,666
BUT...

92
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,700
- BOSS, IS IT TRUE?

93
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:54,900
YOU LET LEE GO ALONE?

94
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:56,466
- NOT ALONE.

95
00:05:56,533 --> 00:06:00,266
I HAD HIM TAKE 150 ORGMEN
ALONG WITH HIM.

96
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:03,433
- BESIDES, LEE HAS THE POWERS
OF A SUPERIOR, RIGHT?

97
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,900
A NECROLIZER LIKE GRAVE

98
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:06,966
DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE
OF DEFEATING HIM.

99
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,100
- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

100
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,600
WE SHOULD RESOLVE THIS SITUATION
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

101
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,433
SO WHY NOT THROW EVERYTHING
WE'VE GOT AT HIM

102
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,733
AND BURY THE GUY?

103
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,533
- LISTEN, LEE WANTS TO AVENGE
THE DEATH OF HIS BEST FRIEND.

104
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,400
SO LET HIM DO IT.

105
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:20,100
- BOB IS DEAD,

106
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,266
AND KUGASHIRA IS MISSING.

107
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,600
AT THIS RATE, THE BACKBONE OF 
THE ORGANIZATION MAY COLLAPSE.

108
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,100
THERE ARE MORE THAN
A FEW MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY

109
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,600
WHO'VE EXPRESSED ADVERSE
SENTIMENTS ABOUT YOUR...

110
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,066
FORCEFUL STYLE OF MANAGEMENT.

111
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:36,766
IN THIS CASE, I THINK A MORE
CAUTIOUS APPROACH IS CALLED FOR.

112
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:40,100
- HA. WE HAVE OUR LOYAL ORGMEN
SERVANTS TO PROTECT US,

113
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:40,933
DON'T WE?

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,333
- OF COURSE.

115
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,966
OUR ORGMEN ARMY IS FAR SUPERIOR
TO MOST NATIONAL MILITIA GROUPS.

116
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:47,966
BUT THE PROPER FUNCTIONING
OF THIS ORGANIZATION

117
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,166
HAS NEVER DEPENDED
ON FORCE ALONE.

118
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:54,100
I AM CERTAIN THAT
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

119
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:58,100
IF LEE SHOULD
LOSE THIS FIGHT,

120
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,900
I'LL TAKE CARE OF
GRAVE MYSELF.

121
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:01,666
JUST LEAVE IT TO ME.

122
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:03,666
- YOU THINK THERE'S A CHANCE
HE MIGHT LOSE?

123
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:06,233
- AN UNLIKELY EVENT, I ADMIT.

124
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,866
BUT I INTEND TO BE READY,

125
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:10,500
JUST IN CASE THE UNLIKELY
SHOULD OCCUR.

126
00:07:10,566 --> 00:07:13,633
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

127
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,266
YOU'RE DOING THIS ON BEHALF
OF THE ORGANIZATION?

128
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,533
- YES, I AM.

129
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:30,900
AS I ALWAYS HAVE...

130
00:07:30,966 --> 00:07:32,866
AND ALWAYS WILL.

131
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:47,666
- YOU KNOW...

132
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,666
IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME
THAT THIS PLACE

133
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:52,166
IS ABOUT TO BECOME
GRAVE'S GRAVE.

134
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:55,166
( laughs )

135
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:56,166
- EXCUSE ME.

136
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:57,566
- MM?

137
00:07:57,633 --> 00:08:00,166
- CAN YOU TELL ME
 ABOUT MY FATHER?

138
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:01,933
I NEVER GOT TO MEET HIM.

139
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,100
- YEAH, I SUPPOSE.

140
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,766
I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT HIM
UNTIL YOUR BUDDY GRAVE SHOWS UP.

141
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,233
IT'LL KILL SOME TIME.

142
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,800
BIG DADDY WAS THE TYPE
OF MAN WHO WAS RESPECTED

143
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:11,900
BY EVERYONE WHO KNEW HIM,

144
00:08:11,966 --> 00:08:13,766
MYSELF INCLUDED.

145
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,533
HE HAD PERSONAL MAGNETISM
AND DIGNITY.

146
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,533
BUT BECAUSE OF
THE TYPE OF MAN HE WAS,

147
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,633
THERE WAS ONE THING
HE WAS LACKING.

148
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:24,533
IT WAS AMBITION.

149
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,166
HE HAD NO PASSION DRIVING HIM
UP THE LADDER OF SUCCESS.

150
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:30,466
- THOSE TWO NICE OLD GUYS
TOLD ME...

151
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:32,433
THAT MY FATHER STARTED
THE MILLENNION ORGANIZATION

152
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,133
TO PROTECT EVERYONE.

153
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,233
- WELL, IT'S HARRY MACDOWEL'S 
MILLENNION NOW, NOT YOUR POP'S.

154
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,733
WHEN AN ORGANIZATION
GETS A NEW BOSS,

155
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,433
ITS POLICIES CHANGE.

156
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,666
IT'S SIMPLY THE NATURAL
PROGRESSION OF LIFE.

157
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,766
PERHAPS WHEN BRANDON HEAT
WAS KILLED,

158
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,300
HE DIED A MARTYR'S DEATH,

159
00:08:49,366 --> 00:08:51,766
GIVING HIS LIFE FOR
BIG DADDY'S MILLENNION.

160
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,933
AND NOW I'M READY
TO GIVE MINE.

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,533
I'M READY AND WILLING TO DIE
FOR HARRY MACDOWEL'S MILLENNION.

162
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,033
GRAVE MAY SEEM NOBLE TO YOU,
BUT AS FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNED,

163
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,700
HE'S A TRAITOR
TO THE ORGANIZATION

164
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:04,766
JUST AS HE WAS
WHEN HARRY KILLED HIM.

165
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,933
NOW HE'S COME BACK
FROM THE DEAD, AND WHY?

166
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,833
TO PROTECT THE OFFSPRING
OF MILLENNION'S ENEMY.

167
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,166
( laughs )

168
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:12,866
HOW IRONIC.

169
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:14,533
- DON'T LAUGH AT HIM!

170
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,533
HE DESERVES MORE RESPECT
THAN THAT.

171
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,400
- WHY WOULD ANYONE
RESPECT A GUY LIKE THAT?

172
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:21,600
THE BOSS TOLD ME
ALL ABOUT HIM.

173
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,933
DID YOU KNOW THAT GRAVE
AND YOUR MOTHER MARIA

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,233
WERE HEAD OVER HEELS
IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER?

175
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,733
- ( exhales )

176
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,066
- YET HE PROTECTS YOU,

177
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:30,866
EVEN THOUGH
YOU'RE A CONSTANT REMINDER

178
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:34,033
THAT THE WOMAN HE LOVED
DUMPED HIM FOR ANOTHER GUY.

179
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,200
HOW CAN I RESPECT A MAN
LIKE THAT?

180
00:09:36,266 --> 00:09:38,166
A DOG HAS MORE PRIDE.

181
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:39,966
I CAN'T HELP
LAUGHING AT THE GUY.

182
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:43,266
HE'S PATHETIC.
( chuckles )

183
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,400
- PLEASE STOP LAUGHING.

184
00:09:45,466 --> 00:09:47,900
- ( continues laughing )

185
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:49,633
- STOP LAUGHING!

186
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,300
- HMM?

187
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:53,833
YOUR EYES...
THEY'RE JUST LIKE HIS.

188
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,133
- ( explosion )

189
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,400
- ( gasps )

190
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:58,466
- ( laughs )

191
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:00,900
I THINK OUR GUEST HAS ARRIVED.

192
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:03,233
HE ENTERS THE PORTAL TO HELL.

193
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,700
LET'S GIVE HIM
A PROPER WELCOME.

194
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,666
- ( Orgmen growling )

195
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,066
- ( screams )

196
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:22,100
- ( growls )

197
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,233
- ( grunts )

198
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:06,566
- HE'S FIGHTING
FOR THE ORGANIZATION.

199
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:09,500
THAT MY DAD CREATED.

200
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:11,500
FIGHTING FOR MY MOM'S...

201
00:11:11,566 --> 00:11:13,466
AND FOR MINE...

202
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:17,533
TO PROTECT.

203
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,333
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
GIVE US A THING.

204
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,500
THAT'S WHAT BEING
A FAMILY IS ALL ABOUT.

205
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:23,766
AS LONG AS WE DON'T
BETRAY ONE ANOTHER,

206
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,700
WE'LL HAVE A BOND BETWEEN US
THAT CAN NEVER BE BROKEN.

207
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,366
- IF I CAN BECOME--

208
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:35,500
I WANT TO BECOME...

209
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:37,066
HIS FAMILY.

210
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:38,500
- ( grunts )

211
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,033
- ( grunting )

212
00:12:06,766 --> 00:12:08,000
- ( gasps )

213
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:30,866
BEYOND THE GRAVE...

214
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:41,333
- ( groans )

215
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:50,533
- THEY SAY YOU WERE
THE BEST SWEEPER

216
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,400
THE ORGANIZATION EVER HAD.

217
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:53,966
WELL-DESERVED ACCOLADE,

218
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:57,966
SINCE YOU JUST DESTROYED
150 ORGMEN SINGLEHANDEDLY.

219
00:12:58,033 --> 00:13:00,800
GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT,
BRANDON.

220
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:05,300
SORRY. BEYOND THE GRAVE.

221
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:07,733
- I KNOW YOU,
BALLADBIRD LEE.

222
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,366
- NOT TO BE INSULTING,

223
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:12,766
BUT YOU'RE PALE ENOUGH
TO BE BIG DADDY'S GHOST.

224
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,933
THE ONE I FEEL SORRY FOR
IS THE BOSS.

225
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,066
HE'S GONNA START
BAWLING LIKE A BABY

226
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:20,800
WHEN I TELL HIM HOW MUCH
HIS OLD FRIEND HAS CHANGED--

227
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,533
THE FRIEND
WHO WANTS TO BETRAY HIM.

228
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:27,200
WHOA.  EASY NOW.
( chuckles )

229
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:29,100
I HAVE A HOSTAGE, REMEMBER?

230
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,266
- ( gasps )

231
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,233
- ( whimpers )

232
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:46,033
- VERY WISE CHOICE.

233
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,200
- DON'T GIVE UP, GRAVE.

234
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,433
- THERE'S SOMETHING 
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU,

235
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,266
SOMETHING I REALLY NEED
TO KNOW.

236
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,300
ARE YOU RESPONSIBLE
FOR BOB'S DEATH?

237
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,233
IT WAS YOU.

238
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,900
YOU KILLED HIM,
DIDN'T YOU?!

239
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:09,733
- YAH!

240
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,533
- ( grunts )

241
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,933
- HOW DARE YOU!

242
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,333
HOW DARE YOU.

243
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,233
HOW DARE YOU!
HOW DARE YOU!

244
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,233
HOW DARE YOU!

245
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,500
( grunting )

246
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,133
- STOP HURTING HIM!
STOP HURTING HIM!

247
00:14:29,766 --> 00:14:31,466
STOP HURTING HIM!

248
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:33,133
- YOUNG LADY, STOP SCREAMING.

249
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,633
THE GAME'S JUST BEGUN.

250
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,900
IT'LL TAKE MORE THAN THAT
TO KILL A NECROLIZER.

251
00:14:36,966 --> 00:14:38,233
AT LEAST I HOPE SO.

252
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,100
THE LONGER IT TAKES HIM
TO DIE, THE BETTER.

253
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:43,100
BUT FOR THE MOMENT,
I CAN AT LEAST DO THIS MUCH!

254
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,100
- ( grunts )

255
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:48,633
( groaning )

256
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,033
- ( laughs )

257
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,900
I WANT YOU TO SUFFER
IN AGONY,

258
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:56,533
THE SAME WAY I DID
WHEN YOU KILLED MY FRIEND.

259
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,800
BUT FIRST,
I'M GOING TO SHATTER YOUR SPIRIT

260
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:00,566
AND SHRIVEL YOUR HEART.
OBSERVE.

261
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:04,233
BIG DADDY'S LITTLE LEGACY--
SO LOVELY, SO ALIVE.

262
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,233
I'LL CUT HER TO PIECES,
AN INCH AT A TIME.

263
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,933
- ( gasps slightly )
- ( gasps )

264
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,900
- ( laughs maniacally )

265
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,933
- NO!

266
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,300
- WHAT THE--?

267
00:15:58,766 --> 00:15:59,966
- LEE!

268
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:01,966
- DR. TOKIOKA!

269
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:03,900
- ( grunts )

270
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,200
- ( screams )

271
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,666
- COME ON, LET'S GO!

272
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:15,966
HURRY!

273
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,566
- COME BACK HERE!

274
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:21,700
- ( gunfire )
- AAH!

275
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,066
GRAVE!

276
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,100
BULLETS CAN'T HURT ME,
YOU IDIOT!

277
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,233
YOU BASTARD!

278
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:53,033
MY, THOSE ARE PUNY WEAPONS.
( laughs )

279
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,733
( screeches )

280
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:14,166
- ARE YOU DOING
ALL RIGHT THERE, YOUNG LADY?

281
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,200
- YES.  I FEEL FINE, THANKS.
HOW ABOUT YOU?

282
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:19,200
- I MAY HAVE PUSHED MYSELF
A LITTLE TOO HARD,

283
00:17:19,266 --> 00:17:21,066
BUT I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

284
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:23,200
THE ANTI-SUPERIOR AMMO
IS READY.

285
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:24,566
SO IF YOU'LL GIVE ME
YOUR GUNS--

286
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:25,900
- ( crashes )
- All: HUH?

287
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,866
- ( laughs maniacally )

288
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:54,500
SORRY, BUT THE FAT LADY
TOOK THE DAY OFF,

289
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:57,533
AND THE SHOW ISN'T OVER
UNTIL THE FAT LADY SINGS.

290
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,033
- ( gasps )
AAH!

291
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,533
- ACT ONE, SCENE ONE:

292
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,000
I CUT YOU TO PIECES
AND WATCH YOU DIE!

293
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:16,066
- HAS SHE PASSED OUT?
IT SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT.

294
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:18,066
- WHO CARES?
COME ON NOW, FOCUS!

295
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:19,466
FOCUS!

296
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:21,300
- ( grunts )

297
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,066
- ( laughs )

298
00:18:32,566 --> 00:18:34,633
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO
DIE AGAIN SO SOON?

299
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,966
THEN AGAIN, IN YOUR CASE,
SINCE YOU'RE ALREADY DEAD...

300
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,600
I SUPPOSE YOU REALLY WOULDN'T
CALL IT DYING, WOULD YOU?

301
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,866
CALL IT WHAT YOU LIKE.
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN!

302
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:45,033
YOU WANT IT, YOU GOT IT!

303
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,100
WHAT THE HELL?

304
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,400
- GRAVE, USE THIS!

305
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,566
I RELOADED IT FOR YOU.

306
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:59,266
- ( shouts )

307
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:05,900
( laughs )

308
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:09,566
DO YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT YOU
CAN DEFEAT A SUPERIOR LIKE ME?

309
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:10,900
( groans )

310
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:13,566
HEY, WHAT THE HELL 
IS HAPPENING TO ME?

311
00:19:13,633 --> 00:19:14,966
( groaning )

312
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:17,033
MY WHOLE BODY'S
BEING TORN APART.

313
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,233
- THOSE BULLETS WERE DESIGNED
TO KILL SUPERIORS LIKE YOU.

314
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,066
GUESS THEY WORK PRETTY WELL.

315
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:24,000
- ( screeches )

316
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:28,266
- ( gunshots )

317
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:31,700
- ( screams )

318
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:42,033
( groaning )

319
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,700
NOT HERE.

320
00:19:49,766 --> 00:19:51,433
NOT NOW.

321
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,800
THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT PLACE

322
00:19:53,866 --> 00:19:55,766
OR THE RIGHT TIME
FOR ME TO DIE.

323
00:19:57,533 --> 00:20:00,466
AND HARRY STILL NEEDS...

324
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,433
MY...

325
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:08,266
( distorted )
HELP.

326
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,766
- GRAVE.

327
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,000
I'D LIKE YOU
TO DO ME A FAVOR.

328
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:29,666
IT'S THE LAST FAVOR
I'LL EVER ASK OF YOU.

329
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:32,633
AND I WON'T BE AROUND
TO ASK FOR MORE.

330
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:46,533
WITH THIS, YOU'LL HAVE
10 MORE DAYS OF MOBILITY.

331
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,366
I SUPPOSE
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TIME

332
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:53,033
TO DESTROY AN ORGANIZATION
THE SIZE OF MILLENNION.

333
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,733
( chuckles softly )

334
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,033
I ONCE IGNORED THE VOICES
INSIDE MYSELF.

335
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,100
I USED TO HOLD ONTO
MY LIFE SO TIGHTLY.

336
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,100
I LET PEOPLE PUSH ME AROUND

337
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,033
BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID
TO CONFRONT ANYONE. 

338
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,166
I GAVE IN
TO EVIL TEMPTATIONS

339
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:17,333
BECAUSE MY COWARDICE 
WOULDN'T LET ME STOP.

340
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,700
NOW MY MEMORIES AND MY REGRETS
ARE BLURRED AND INDISTINCT.

341
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:26,633
THERE'S ONLY ONE REGRET
I CAN'T LET GO OF.

342
00:21:28,366 --> 00:21:31,666
I NEVER GOT TO MAKE...

343
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:33,666
A DIFFERENCE.

344
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:47,566
- WHERE-- HOW DID I
GET BACK HERE IN THE TRAILER?

345
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,766
GRAVE?  DOCTOR?

346
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,433
HUH?

347
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,266
OH, GRAVE,
THANKS FOR SAVING ME.

348
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,233
YOU'RE PRETTY AMAZING,
YOU KNOW?

349
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,433
( gasps )

350
00:22:08,366 --> 00:22:09,500
NO...

351
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,000
DR. TOKIOKA,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

352
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:15,000
PLEASE ANSWER ME.

353
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:16,233
DOCTOR!

354
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,200
( crying )

355
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,733
THEY ALWAYS DIE.
EVERYONE ALWAYS DIES.

356
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,266
IT'S NOT FAIR.
IT'S NOT FAIR AT ALL.

357
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:31,766
WHY DID HE HAVE TO DIE?

358
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,900
WHY DO THEY ALWAYS
HAVE TO DIE?!

359
00:22:39,033 --> 00:22:40,966
( screaming )

360
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,600
- ( rock music playing )

361
00:22:57,733 --> 00:22:59,633
- ( man singing in Japanese )

362
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,333
- Brandon Heat:
THEY CONFRONT EACH OTHER

363
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,033
WITH NO POSSIBILITY
OF COMPROMISE.

364
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,900
HIS NEED TO PROTECT
HIS BELOVED'S DAUGHTER

365
00:24:21,966 --> 00:24:25,566
IS MATCHED BY THE OTHER'S
NEED TO PROTECT HIM.

366
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:28,366
MILLENNION IS THE BATTLEGROUND.
