1
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:11,500
( theme music playing )

2
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,200
- ( inaudible )

3
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,100
Nathan: JOLICE...

4
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:52,100
- Kenny: THIS CAN'T BE...

5
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,933
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

6
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,700
- Nathan: I'M SORRY, JOLICE...

7
00:01:58,766 --> 00:02:00,200
IT'S ALL MY FAULT!

8
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:01,366
THIS NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

9
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:03,666
IF I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO GET DINNER READY!

10
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:05,266
- Kenny: WHO DID IT?

11
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,000
WHO THE HELL KILLED HIM?

12
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:08,500
- Harry: THIS WASN'T A ROBBERY.

13
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:10,000
A THIEF WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS.

14
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:12,066
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
ANYONE HAD REASON TO KILL

15
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,500
A SHY, GENTLE GUY LIKE JOLICE.

16
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:16,233
WHICH MEANS HE WASN'T
THE TARGET.

17
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,933
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR US.

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,333
WE'RE THE ONES THEY'RE AFTER.

19
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,466
- Kenny: BUT, WHY?
WHO THE HELL IS IT?

20
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:23,200
- Nathan: WE JUST GOT
THE CRAP BEAT OUT OF US

21
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:24,866
SAVING YOUR SORRY
ASS, REMEMBER?

22
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:27,466
SO DON'T TRY TELLING US
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO IT IS.

23
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:28,733
- Kenny: YOU SAYING
IT'S MY FAULT?

24
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,100
- Harry: WHO GIVES A DAMN WHY?
WE GOTTA RUN.

25
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,233
WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE
AS FAST AS WE CAN.

26
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,433
- Brandon: JOLICE IS GONE...

27
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:43,933
IN THIS CITY WHERE DEATH
IS EVERYONE'S NEIGHBOR,

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,766
HIS DEATH WAS JUST
A COMMONPLACE, ORDINARY THING.

29
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,233
- Woman 1: I KNEW THIS WAS
GOING TO HAPPEN SOONER OR LATER.

30
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,166
- Man: IT'S SHAMEFUL. HE WAS
JUST A KID FOR PETE'S SAKE.

31
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:20,300
- Woman 2: HIS FRIENDS ARE
UNLIKE THE OTHER PUNKS IN TOWN.

32
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,266
THEY ARE ALWAYS POLITE TO US.

33
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,933
- Woman 3:
THE KID WHO WAS MURDERED,

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,100
WASN'T HE THE REALLY QUIET ONE?

35
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,433
POOR THING...

36
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,566
- Woman 4:
IT'S AWFUL.

37
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:31,600
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD JUST
ISN'T SAFE ANY MORE.

38
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,300
- THAT'S RIGHT.

39
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:39,633
YEAH, I KNOW.

40
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,966
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE MONEY, OKAY?

41
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:43,666
ALL RIGHT,
I'M COUNTING ON YOU!

42
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:48,300
- ( chuckles )
THAT BASTARD HARRY

43
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:50,766
MUST BE SHAKING IN
HIS BOOTS RIGHT ABOUT NOW!

44
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,700
YEAH, HE AND HIS GANG
ARE RUNNING SCARED.

45
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,133
I WISH I COULD SEE
THE LOOK ON THE COWARD'S FACE.

46
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,500
- LISTEN, YOU IDIOT.

47
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:59,366
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO GOT THE CRAP
BEAT OUT OF HIM BY THOSE COWARDS

48
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:02,300
WHO RAN AWAY JUST 'CAUSE ONE
OF THEIR FRIENDS GOT KILLED.

49
00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:04,433
- ER, WELL, I UH...

50
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:13,266
- WELL, THEN WHY DON'T YOU
DO IT YOURSELF?

51
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:15,233
FOR A CHANGE.

52
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,966
INSTEAD OF COUNTING ON
OTHERS TO DO IT FOR YOU!

53
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:23,500
BESIDES, I HAVE SOME BUSINESS
OF MY OWN TO TAKE CARE OF.

54
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:25,166
- BUT, I MEAN, I...

55
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,833
- DON'T DO ANYTHING TO DRAW
ANYONE'S ATTENTION, ALL RIGHT?

56
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,933
- YEAH, I'LL COOPERATE.

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,500
I'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

58
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:50,266
JUST ONE THING.

59
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,133
I NEED TO TAKE
A LITTLE SIDE TRIP.

60
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,233
- HAVING A BAD DAY?

61
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:10,333
- NOT JUST BAD.
A FREAKIN' NIGHTMARE.

62
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,166
ONE OF MY GUYS
GOT MURDERED TODAY.

63
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:14,166
- I KNOW. HELL, EVERYBODY DOES.

64
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:16,233
- IT'S ALL OVER TOWN.
- WHO DID IT?

65
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,866
COME ON. YOU KNOW I'M NOT NICE
ENOUGH TO TELL YOU FOR FREE...

66
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:20,100
- ( thuds )

67
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:23,933
- WELL, SEEING AS YOU'RE
SUCH AN OLD FRIEND,

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,533
BAD NEWS HARRY.

69
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,866
LADD IS BACK.

70
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,866
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT! DEED'S BIG
BROTHER IS BACK IN TOWN AGAIN.

71
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:38,100
- I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD.

72
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,600
- YOU THOUGHT WRONG.
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN DREAMING.

73
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:42,600
THIS JUST IN.

74
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,900
"MAD DOG LADD" HAS COME BACK
AND NOW,

75
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:47,366
HE'S A MADE MAN,
A MEMBER OF THE MAFIA.

76
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:48,533
- HUH?

77
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,333
- IT'S WHAT YOU'D CALL

78
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,066
YOUR WORST CASE SCENARIO.

79
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,200
- ( men laughing )

80
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,666
- YOU BASTARD!
SO YOU SOLD ME OUT!

81
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:06,166
- UNDER DURESS.
SO DON'T HOLD IT AGAINST ME.

82
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,233
- HEY, WHAT THE HELL.

83
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,633
- HEY, GET BACK HERE.

84
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:15,566
- YOU SON OF A BITCH.
GO AHEAD, RUN.

85
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:17,566
I HOPE YOU DIE LIKE A DOG!

86
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,066
- HIS NAME IS LADD CARABEL.

87
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,733
RUMOR HAS IT THAT
HE'S AN EXPERT

88
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,700
AND HE WORKS WITH
SPEED AND PRECISION.

89
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:28,766
- WHERE IS HE?

90
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,533
- THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

91
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,933
- FIND HIM NO MATTER WHAT.

92
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:37,833
- OH, I'M SO HUNGRY...

93
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,033
- HARRY WILL GET BACK SOON.
HANG IN THERE.

94
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,333
HE'LL FIND A WAY
TO GET US OUT OF THIS.

95
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,766
HE ALWAYS DOES, RIGHT?

96
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,966
WITH HARRY AND
BRANDON ON OUR SIDE,

97
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,400
WE'LL GET OUT OF THIS MESS.

98
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:50,100
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T
SCREW IT UP.

99
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:54,366
- YOU BASTARD,
SAY ONE MORE WORD...

100
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:55,833
- KNOCK IT OFF.

101
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,066
- ( stomach growling )

102
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:02,200
- I CAN EVEN GET MAD.
I'M TOO HUNGRY.

103
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:06,933
- HEY, IT'S HARRY!

104
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,566
- ALL RIGHT! LET'S EAT.

105
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,300
- HEY, GUYS...

106
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:18,933
- HARRY! WHAT HAPPENED!

107
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:21,433
- THAT SON OF A BITCH, SCOTT,

108
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,300
HE SOLD US OUT.

109
00:07:23,366 --> 00:07:24,666
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

110
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:26,433
- WHAT ARE YOU TAKING ABOUT?

111
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,666
WHAT HAPPENED?

112
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:30,166
HEY, HARRY!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

113
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:31,266
HARRY!

114
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,900
- Harry: MAD DOG LADD...

115
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:38,766
DEED'S BIG BROTHER.
HE CAME BACK.

116
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,433
- ( tires screeching )

117
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:47,466
- BAD NEWS. REAL BAD NEWS.

118
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,566
- THEN, JOLICE, IT WAS HIM?

119
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:52,166
- DEED WANTS TO GET BACK AT US
BUT HE'S TOO SCARED.

120
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:54,300
SO WE WENT AND WHINED
TO HIS BROTHER.

121
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:56,533
- ( groans )
- WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S WRONG?

122
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,166
- HIT IN THE SIDE...

123
00:07:58,233 --> 00:08:00,000
HURTS LIKE A SON OF A BITCH.

124
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:02,866
- SHIT! HOW ARE WE GONNA
GET OUT OF HERE?

125
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:04,800
WHAT DO WE DO?

126
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:06,033
- ( thunder rumbles )

127
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:19,200
- HOW CAN I HELP YOU, SIR?

128
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,033
- ( gun shots firing )

129
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:30,700
- ( all gasp )

130
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,066
- GOOD EVENING TO YOU,
DR. TOKIOKA.

131
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:47,466
FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR IGNORING US,

132
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:49,666
REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE
OUR REQUEST.

133
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:55,000
OH, I SEE. YOU'RE WELL PREPARED.
THAT'S ADMIRABLE.

134
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:56,633
BUT THIS IS ENEMY TERRITORY,

135
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,233
WE'LL HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE
ELSE FOR A LITTLE CHAT.

136
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,666
AFTER ALL, YOU'RE SO YOUNG.

137
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:03,866
MUCH TOO YOUNG TO DIE.

138
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:06,366
SO I'M SURE YOU WON'T MIND
COMING WITH US?

139
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:18,533
DON'T FORGET TO SAY THANKS
TO THE BIG BOSS FOR ME.

140
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,966
NOW I CAN DO WHATEVER
THE HELL I WANT

141
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:23,200
AS LONG AS I STAY
OUT OF HIS WAY.

142
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:24,433
HURRY UP, WILL YOU?

143
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,100
IF IT TAKES TOO LONG,
MILLENNION WILL FIND OUT.

144
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:34,500
( chuckles )

145
00:09:57,633 --> 00:10:00,433
- DON'T DO IT, BRANDON.

146
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:04,300
YOU'LL END UP LIKE ME.

147
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:12,100
HOW CAN I EXPLAIN...

148
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,800
I WAS KIDDING MYSELF, I SUPPOSE.

149
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:18,100
NO WORK ALL PLAY, PARTYING WITH
MY BUDDIES ALL NIGHT,

150
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,300
CONNING WOMEN
TO GET THEIR MONEY,

151
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:22,566
SPENDING IT ON WHATEVER
I WANTED.

152
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:24,800
THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE MORE
WHENEVER I NEEDED IT.

153
00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:26,800
AS LONG AS I KEPT
PAYING MY DUES

154
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:28,600
TO THE BIG BOSS OF
THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

155
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,266
NO ONE GAVE ME ANY GRIEF.

156
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,833
I'VE BEEN A PUNK, A ROGUE
AND A SCOUNDREL

157
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,366
FOR TOO LONG TO
BE ANYTHING ELSE.

158
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:36,966
AND THE FUNNY THING IS,

159
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:39,566
I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE ONLY
WAY I COULD FIND THE FREEDOM

160
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:40,966
THAT I WANTED.

161
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:42,566
- ( groans )
- HARRY!

162
00:10:46,066 --> 00:10:51,100
- BRANDON...
I WANT US ALL TO BE FREE.

163
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,933
- WE WILL BE, HARRY.

164
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,833
- I DON'T WANNA DIE.

165
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,933
- WE'LL SURVIVE.
ALL OF US.

166
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:03,133
- THAT'S GREAT. I HOPE SO.

167
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:24,366
- ( thunder rumbling )

168
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,100
- I'VE SEEN THAT DUDE BEFORE.

169
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,233
- HEY, THAT'S BRANDON,
ONE OF HARRY'S GUYS.

170
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,600
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

171
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,033
- LET'S SEE WHERE HE GOES.

172
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,500
WE CAN SELL THE INFO TO DEED
AND SCORE SOME GREEN.

173
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:42,966
- YEAH.

174
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,800
- YOU THINK THAT GUY
COULD HAVE DONE THIS?

175
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:57,500
- REPORT IT TO BIG DADDY.

176
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:58,933
- RIGHT AWAY, SIR.

177
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:04,000
- ( thunder crashing )

178
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:46,233
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT
YOU AND YOUR BUDDIES.

179
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,433
YOU PLANTED THE SEED,

180
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,933
SO YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE CONSEQUENCES.

181
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,900
BUT I DON'T WANT MARIA
INVOLVED IN THIS.

182
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:55,533
IT'S NOT RIGHT COMING TO ME

183
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,666
JUST 'CAUSE YOU HAVE NO
ONE ELSE TO TURN TO.

184
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:03,366
- USE THIS.

185
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:06,733
- YOU WANT TO SURVIVE, THEN
LEAVE TOWN. RIGHT NOW, TONIGHT.

186
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,233
AND FORGET ABOUT MARIA.

187
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:13,200
BRANDON, YOU LOVE HER,
DON'T YOU?

188
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:18,733
STAY HERE AND YOU'LL DIE AND
HER HEART WILL DIE WITH YOU.

189
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:23,200
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? YOU CAN
ONLY CAUSE HER UNHAPPINESS.

190
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:25,466
I'VE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

191
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:28,433
AND ALL I WANT FOR HER,
IS A LIFE

192
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,433
FILLED WITH ONLY HAPPINESS.

193
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,933
- ( gun shot fires )

194
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,566
- ( baby crying )

195
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,666
- TAKE THIS. I ASSUME
YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT.

196
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:08,933
SURVIVE. FOR MARIA'S SAKE
AS WELL AS YOUR OWN.

197
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,000
- ( tires screech )

198
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:18,700
- WELL, LOOK HERE, IT'S BRANDON.

199
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:21,333
- BRANDON'S A PRETTY TOUGH DUDE.
HE'LL BE OKAY.

200
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,133
SHOULDN'T WE WAIT
UNTIL HE GETS BACK.

201
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,966
- YOU IDIOT! BRANDON
WOULDN'T HAVE A CHANCE

202
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:26,400
AGAINST MAD DOG LADD.

203
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,300
HE'S A PSYCHO KILLING MACHINE.

204
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:29,866
- THAT ASSHOLE...

205
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:31,200
- BUT NOBODY KNOWS
WHERE BRANDON WENT,

206
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:32,666
SO HOW ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO FIND HIM?

207
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:34,366
- I DON'T THINK IT'S
REAL HARD TO GUESS

208
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:36,333
WHERE HE'S GOING
TO END UP TONIGHT.

209
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,100
OH, AT MARIA'S HOUSE!

210
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:41,133
- MOVE OVER, OLD MAN.
YOU'RE IN MY WAY.

211
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,866
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
THERE, THAT SHOULD DO IT.

212
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:47,266
- YOU'RE GONNA PAY
FOR MAKING A FOOL OUT OF ME.

213
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,900
THAT'S RIGHT. I FOUND OUT.

214
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:51,466
LET'S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT.

215
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:53,533
THIS IS NO TOY
LIKE THE LAST TIME.

216
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,300
IT'S THE REAL DEAL.

217
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,866
- MARIA...

218
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:05,933
MARIA...

219
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:08,766
- SAY GOODBYE

220
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,333
- ( gun shot fires )

221
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,066
- ( groaning )

222
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:21,866
- GET LOST! AND DON'T EVER
COME NEAR HIM AGAIN!

223
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:23,666
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING, OLD MAN?

224
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:25,633
- ( gun shots firing )

225
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:28,400
- GO!

226
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:30,566
THE NEXT GOS THROUGH
YOUR HEART!

227
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:44,666
THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL
"PUTTING YOUR PAST TO GOOD USE."

228
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,633
- ( gun shots firing )

229
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,666
- WE FOUND HIM, SIR.

230
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,033
- TAKE ME TO HIM.

231
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,200
HIGHLY SKILLED,
EX-MILITARY, PERHAPS.

232
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:15,700
OR A RETIRED POLICEMAN,
OR EVEN MORE LIKELY, ONE OF US.

233
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,033
MY POOR LITTLE BROTHER,
HE'S SO DAMN PITIFUL.

234
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,666
I TRIED TO LET HIM
TAKE THE CREDIT

235
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,266
FOR KILLING YOU, BRANDON.

236
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,700
- ( grunts )

237
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,233
- MARIA...

238
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:35,933
TELL MARIA THAT I'M SORRY.

239
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,000
MARIA...

240
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:46,200
- HEY...

241
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:48,433
HEY, YOU.

242
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,133
I'M TALKING TO YOU!

243
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,066
I THINK IT'S TIME TO HAVE
A LITTLE FUN.

244
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:59,466
- BRANDON. NO!

245
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:03,933
- OH, MY! LOOK WHO'S HERE.
LONG TIME NO SEE, HARRY BOY.

246
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,033
- YOU BASTARD...

247
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,900
- YOU'RE JUST IN TIME TO SAVE
YOUR FRIEND A WHOLE LOT OF PAIN.

248
00:17:08,966 --> 00:17:12,000
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO TORTURE HIM
UNTIL HE TOLD ME WHERE YOU WERE.

249
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:16,266
EVER SO RARE
IS TRUE FRIENDSHIP, RIGHT?

250
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,466
- PLEASE. JUST HOLD ON A MINUTE.

251
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:20,966
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE FIGHT
WITH DEED AND HIS GUYS.

252
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:22,866
IT WAS MY FAULT
AND I APOLOGIZE.

253
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:25,600
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
PLEASE, FORGIVE ME.

254
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,266
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

255
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,833
- ( gun shots firing )

256
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,100
- OH, SHIT, BRANDON!

257
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,600
YOU CRAZY SON OF A BITCH.

258
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,833
- HEY KENNY, GIVE ME YOUR GUN!

259
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,133
- WHAT? BUT NATHAN, IT WON'T...
I MEAN IT'S NOT...

260
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,933
- MAD DOG!

261
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,400
NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE,
YOU CRAZY BASTARD.

262
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:47,733
- ( gun clicks )

263
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:52,733
- WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
THIS IS JUST A TOY!

264
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,900
- ( gun shot fires )

265
00:17:56,966 --> 00:17:58,466
- ( both gasping )

266
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,733
- ( screams )

267
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,300
- NATHAN! NATHAN!

268
00:18:06,366 --> 00:18:08,300
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO LOOK COOL...

269
00:18:08,366 --> 00:18:10,433
- I TRIED TO TELL YOU...
- STUPID.

270
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,233
- REAL STUPID.
- ( gun shot fires )

271
00:18:16,966 --> 00:18:18,200
- KENNY!

272
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,700
- DON'T WORRY, THERE'S NO RUSH.

273
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:24,200
I'LL PUT YOU OUT
OF YOUR MISERY SOON.

274
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:25,933
- ( tires screeching )

275
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,933
- IS YOUR NAME LADD CARABEL?

276
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,533
- WAIT A SEC.
YOU LOOK FAMILIAR.

277
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,733
HEY, YOU'RE BEAR WALKEN,
AREN'T YOU?

278
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,100
( chuckles ) ISN'T THIS
A TREAT!

279
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,900
ONE OF MILLENNION'S TOP EXECS

280
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:49,333
HAS COME TO PAY A
VISIT TO ME IN PERSON.

281
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,733
- MILLENNION?

282
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,600
- BIG DADDY ISN'T GONNA
LIKE THIS.

283
00:19:02,866 --> 00:19:05,200
WE NEED TO SETTLE THIS
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

284
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:07,133
- THAT'S WHAT I WANT TOO.

285
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,000
WHAT I DID WAS PERSONAL, IT HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH OPERATIONS

286
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,333
IN MY TERRITORY
OR THE WAY I RAM THEM.

287
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,500
WHETHER I GO BACK WILLINGLY
OR NOT WON'T CHANGE THE OUTCOME.

288
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:17,133
I'M SURE THAT A
MADE GUY LIKE YOU

289
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,633
KNOWS THE PROTOCOLS
OF THE ORGANIZATION

290
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,066
ALL TOO WELL.

291
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:23,500
WELL, THE, AT LEAST LET ME
PICK MY OWN PLACE TO DIE.

292
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:25,666
- ( gun shots firing )

293
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:42,833
- GUYS LIKE YOU,
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT?

294
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,733
ANSWER ME!

295
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,200
- ( chuckles ) WOULD YOU
IF YOU WERE ME?

296
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:55,166
- NO, I WOULDN'T.

297
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:59,033
- THEN YOU UNDERSTAND
WHY I WON'T.

298
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,400
- I SEE. I SHOULD HAVE
EXPECTED AS MUCH.

299
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:10,866
YOU CAN TAKE REVENGE
FOR YOUR FRIENDS.

300
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,033
- ( screams )

301
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,166
- ( gun shot fires )

302
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:37,933
- THIS AREA
WILL HAVE TO BE CLEANED UP.

303
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,300
I LEAVE THAT TO YOU.

304
00:20:39,366 --> 00:20:42,133
I'LL TAKE CARE OF
THE YOUNG LADY.

305
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:46,933
BUNCH OF STUPID,
HELPLESS BRATS.

306
00:20:56,433 --> 00:20:57,866
- UNCLE?

307
00:20:59,366 --> 00:21:00,600
UNCLE?

308
00:21:14,766 --> 00:21:17,033
- ( police siren wailing
in the distance )

309
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:42,933
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHERE'S MY BROTHER?

310
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,500
- YOUR BROTHER'S NO LONGER
WITH US, I'M AFRAID.

311
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:48,400
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

312
00:21:48,466 --> 00:21:50,700
PLEASE, WAIT. JUST HOLD ON.

313
00:21:50,766 --> 00:21:52,000
HE ACTED ON HIS OWN!

314
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:54,100
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
THE THINGS HE DID!

315
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,200
THAT'S THE TRUTH!

316
00:21:55,266 --> 00:21:58,400
I'M INNOCENT!
PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!

317
00:21:58,466 --> 00:22:00,733
NO! NO, DON'T. I BEG YOU.

318
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,833
NO, DEED.

319
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,000
YOU'RE NOT INNOCENT.

320
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:07,066
YOU ROBBED US OF MANY THINGS
WE CARED ABOUT.

321
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:09,966
BUT I... WON'T ROB YOU.

322
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:13,233
I WILL GIVE, NOT TAKE.

323
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,200
AND THE GIFT THAT I WILL GIVE
IS DEATH!

324
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:22,166
- ( gun shot fires )

325
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:32,000
- Brandon: LIFE AND DEATH ARE
LIKE TWO SIDES OF A COIN.

326
00:22:32,066 --> 00:22:34,700
EACH OF US CAN TAKE,
AND EACH OF US CAN GIVE.

327
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:36,833
AND THE UNSEEN FORCE
THAT DECIDES

328
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,233
WHO WILL GIVE AND WHO WILL TAKE

329
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,033
POURS OVER EVERYONE
WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION.

330
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,866
JUST LIKE THIS RAIN.

331
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,766
- ( pop song playing )

332
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:59,733
- ( man singing )

333
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,100
- Brandon: THE BELLS OF
REQUIEM ARE RINGING.

334
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:21,233
THE BELLS OF REGRET.
THE BELLS OF SADNESS.

335
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,366
AND THE RINGING OF THOSE BELLS

336
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:27,933
MAYBE AN INDICATION OF WHAT
THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR US ALL.
