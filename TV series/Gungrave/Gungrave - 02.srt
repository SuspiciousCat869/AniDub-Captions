1
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:11,966
( theme music playing )

2
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:47,133
- ( inaudible )

3
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:48,533
- Brandon: WE COMPARE.

4
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,033
HUMANS ARE CREATURES
OF COMPARISON.

5
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,866
CONSTANTLY DECIDING WHETHER
THINGS ARE GOOD OR BAD

6
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:56,300
OR BETTER OR WORSE
THAN OTHER THINGS.

7
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,266
EVENTUALLY, WE MAKE
SO MANY COMPARISONS

8
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,966
THAT OUR OVERLOADED BRAINS
WILL ACCEPT ANYTHING.

9
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:04,466
GOOD OR BAD, RIGHT OR WRONG,
NOT CARING WHICH IS WHICH.

10
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,700
THERE WAS NOTHING
OUT OF THE ORDINARY

11
00:02:10,766 --> 00:02:12,000
ABOUT BEING A CRIMINAL.

12
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,633
OR VICTIM OF A CRIME.

13
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,666
IT WAS AN EVERYDAY,
ORDINARY THING.

14
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:18,533
AND VIOLENCE WAS JUST
PART OF THE DAILY ROUTINE.

15
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,500
SO I, NO, WE, NEVER
THOUGHT TO QUESTION

16
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:24,433
THE WAY THINGS WERE
IN THIS CITY...

17
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,300
WHERE THINGS HAPPEN
AND SUDDEN DEATH

18
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:28,433
WAS JUST A FACT OF LIFE.

19
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:35,466
THAT'S RIGHT, BACK THEN
EVERYTHING WAS ORDINARY.

20
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:37,966
- ( police siren wailing )

21
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:45,233
- ( grunting )

22
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,400
- ( whistling )

23
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:09,200
HMM?

24
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,066
HEY! WHAT ARE YOU
DOING, YOU BUM?

25
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:20,033
DON'T YOU BE SCROUNGING AROUND
IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S TRASH.

26
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,033
- I'M SORRY!
- GET LOST, YOU HYENA!

27
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,233
- YES, SIR! I'M GOING.

28
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,600
- POW!

29
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,333
( chuckles )

30
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,000
STILL WORKING OUT, HUH?
SAME OLD BRANDON!

31
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:34,700
COME ON IN, I GOT SOME
JUICY STUFF TO TELL YOU.

32
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:39,866
- I'M BACK!

33
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:42,133
- Jolice: WELCOME HOME, KENNY.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

34
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,666
- SOMEWHERE NICE!

35
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:45,500
HEY, JOLICE, GET ME
SOMETHING TO DRINK, WILL YA?

36
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:47,833
- SURE. COMING RIGHT UP.

37
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,200
- IT'S THE WORST! THIS WEEK
IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST...

38
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:53,633
- HARRY! I GOT A
SURPRISE FOR YOU.

39
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,733
JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THIS!

40
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,300
- HUH?
- HEY, HOW DID YOU GET THAT?

41
00:03:58,366 --> 00:04:00,600
- SCOTT WAS THE ONE WHO
TOLD ME WHERE I COULD FIND IT.

42
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,966
AND THEN I JUST DID MY USUAL
THING, IN THE USUAL WAY.

43
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:05,600
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK, HUH?

44
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,000
I GOT PRETTY LUCKY
TODAY, DIDN'T I?

45
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:12,200
- YOU IDIOT. LIFTING A THING
LIKE THAT WON'T DO US ANY GOOD.

46
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:13,666
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

47
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,566
- FIRST OF ALL,
IT'S A ONE OF A KIND ITEM

48
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:17,166
AND EASILY IDENTIFIABLE.

49
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:18,733
SO HOW ARE YOU GONNA SELL IT?

50
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,966
YOU MIGHT AS WELL WEAR
A SIGN SAYING, "I'M A THIEF,

51
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:23,200
WANNA BUY SOME
STOLEN MERCHANDISE?"

52
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:25,233
YOU'RE HOPELESS...

53
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,000
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
THIS LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU.

54
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:30,600
- I WORKED SO HARD TO GET IT.

55
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,100
MAN, YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

56
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,100
- SURE YOU DID!

57
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,900
BUT YOUR HARD WORK ISN'T
GONNA PAYOFF THIS TIME.

58
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:40,466
- SORRY, BUDDY!
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

59
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:41,733
- ( laughs )

60
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,666
- HEY, YOU GOT NO BUSINESS
LAUGHING AT ME, JOLICE!

61
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:46,400
- OH, SORRY.

62
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,633
- HMM? WHAT DO YOU WANT?

63
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:56,133
WHAT, WHAT'S THAT FOR?
DO YOU MEAN YOU WANNA BUY IT?

64
00:04:58,066 --> 00:04:59,133
WELL NOW,

65
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,933
THAT IS A LOT LESS THAN
THE GOIN' RATE, YOU KNOW.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,333
BUT, LOOKS LIKE TODAY
IS YOUR LUCKY DAY, BRANDON.

67
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:07,300
IT'S A DEAL.

68
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,600
- YOU'RE GONNA GIVE IT
TO MARIA, IS THAT IT?

69
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,800
I WOULDN'T, IF I WERE YOU.

70
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:16,033
IT'LL CAUSE NOTHING
BUT PROBLEMS FOR HER.

71
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:25,333
- HEY, NO WAY I AM GIVING
YOU A REFUND, PAL.

72
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,700
- FORGET ABOUT IT,
A DEAL'S A DEAL.

73
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:29,100
- HEY, IT'S DEED!

74
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,866
RIGHT NOW, HE'S GATHERING
ALL THE BEST FIGHTERS HE'S GOT.

75
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:34,633
- HMM. RETALIATING
FOR LAST TIME, HUH?

76
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,233
- WHAT DO WE DO?
- THE ANSWER'S OBVIOUS.

77
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:41,666
- YOU'RE ITCHING FOR
A FIGHT ALREADY?

78
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,000
JOLICE, YOU'RE IN CHARGE
UNTIL WE GET BACK.

79
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:47,466
- RIGHT. BE CAREFUL
OUT THERE, GUYS.

80
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:51,866
- I'LL FINALLY GET
TO SHOW THIS OFF.

81
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:53,900
- YOU SURE YOU KNOW
HOW TO USE THAT THING?

82
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:56,600
- YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

83
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,300
- WELL, AS FOR ME,
I'M COUNTING IN BRANDON.

84
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:03,400
- BYE, MARIA.
- BYE. SEE YOU TOMORROW.

85
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,533
- SORRY, WERE YOU WAITING LONG?

86
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,766
- GREAT. SO WHERE DO YOU
THINK WE SHOULD GO TODAY?

87
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:09,800
- LET'S SEE...

88
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:11,500
- ( horn honking )

89
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:14,766
- IT'S MY UNCLE.

90
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,966
YOU REALLY DIDN'T HAVE
TO COME PICK ME UP.

91
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:21,800
- YEAH, I KNOW. BUT I GOT
OFF WORK EARLY TODAY.

92
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:22,900
- I PROMISED MY FRIEND

93
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:26,133
WE'D GO OUT FOR A CUP OF
COFFEE ON THE WAY HOME.

94
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,366
- YOU SHOULDN'T WANDER
AROUND TOWN LIKE THAT.

95
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:30,566
NOT WITH GUYS LIKE THAT AROUND.

96
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:31,666
- HUH?

97
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,233
- ( men grunting )

98
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,366
- BRANDON AND HARRY...
OH, UNCLE!

99
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:41,400
- YOU STAY OUT OF IT.
IT'S ONLY A FIGHT BETWEEN PUNKS.

100
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:42,633
- BUT...

101
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,833
- TRUTH IS, IF THEY SCREW UP,
THEY'RE GONNA END UP DEAD.

102
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,966
SO WHAT? THEY'RE THE ONES
WHO CHOSE TO LIVE THAT WAY.

103
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,200
- BUT UNCLE...

104
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:55,900
- PLEASE, DON'T UPSET ME
BY ARGUING MARIA, ALL RIGHT?

105
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:05,166
- ( grunting )

106
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:08,333
- NOT BAD.

107
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,133
- ( grunts )

108
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,400
- ( chuckles )

109
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:19,366
- ( grunting )

110
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,900
- NICELY DONE.

111
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,200
- ( grunting )

112
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:47,500
- ( sighs )

113
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:51,133
- WELL, DEED, WHAT'S IT
GONNA BE? YOU WANT SOME MORE?

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,400
- YOU BASTARD!

115
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:57,633
- AH, WOULD YOU LOOK AT
THAT, THE IDIOT'S GOT A GUN.

116
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,600
KENNY, GET YOURS OUT TOO.

117
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,566
- WELL, I, UM...

118
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:05,100
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

119
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,033
- WELL, IT'S NOT...

120
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,933
- KENNY!

121
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,033
- ( laughs )

122
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,666
- HEY, ARE YOU SOME KIND OF
AN IDIOT? OR WHAT?

123
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:26,500
( breathing heavily )

124
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,033
- COME BACK HERE.
COME ON, YOU COWARDS.

125
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:45,233
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
OH MAN, IT'S A FREAKIN' TOY.

126
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:47,633
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

127
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,833
- THAT BASTARD!

128
00:08:51,466 --> 00:08:53,166
- HEY HARRY,
REMIND ME, WILL YOU?

129
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:56,200
WHAT STARTED THIS THING?
WHY ARE WE FIGHTING THESE GUYS?

130
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:57,933
- BECAUSE OF A WOMAN,
THAT'S WHY.

131
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,400
HARRY WAS BIRD-DOGGIN
DEED'S LITTLE SUGAR LOVE.

132
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:04,166
- HEY, NO WAY. SHE WAS
THE ONE WHO CAME ON TO ME.

133
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:07,466
- SO THAT'S IT. NO WONDER
HE'S SO TICKED OFF.

134
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:09,166
- HE'S JUST PUTTING
ON THIS MACHO ACT

135
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:11,466
CAUSE HE WANTS TO BE LIKE
HIS BROTHER, YOU KNOW.

136
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:13,433
- OH, YOU MEAN
"MAD DOG LADD?"

137
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,600
- YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

138
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,033
MAD DOG WAS A BIG
CELEBRITY AROUND HERE.

139
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,000
- YEAH, ONE SCARY SON OF BITCH,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

140
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:24,033
ON THE OTHER HAND,
DEED HAS TO FACE THE FACT

141
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,233
THAT HE'S A COWARD
AND ALWAYS WILL BE.

142
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,000
- AIN'T THAT THE TRUTH.

143
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:29,700
( laughs )

144
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:32,400
- SPEAKING OF MAD DOG,
HE GOT KILLED, DIDN'T HE?

145
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,766
- WHAT? WHEN?

146
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,766
- I HEARD THAT HE GOT INTO A
GUN FIGHT WITH SOME PUNK

147
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,200
AND THEY ENDED UP
SHOOTING EACH OTHER TO DEATH.

148
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:41,466
- YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING!
A BUDDY OF MINE TOLD ME

149
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:42,633
HE KILLED A BUNCH OF COPS

150
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,033
PULLING OFF SOME KINDA
SPECTACULAR ROBBERY.

151
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,866
AND THAT HE'S BEEN
ON THE RUN EVER SINCE.

152
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:49,733
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT I HEARD WAS...

153
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,633
- HARRY!

154
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,066
OH, HARRY!

155
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,033
- HEY, KATHERINE.
- THERE YOU ARE, DARLING.

156
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:04,566
- GOOD.

157
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:06,133
THAT WAS EXCELLENT WORK.

158
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,800
YOUR GROUP HAS ALWAYS
BEEN REAL DEPENDABLE.

159
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:12,466
- WELL, OF COURSE...
- THANKS TO HARRY, MOST LIKELY?

160
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:14,466
- WELL, I GUESS YOU
COULD SAY THAT...

161
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:18,666
- HE'S YOUNG, BUT IMPRESSIVE.
HE'S PRETTY SMART, TOO.

162
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:23,033
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE HIM.

163
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,666
- Man: YOU WHIMPERING MORON.

164
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:27,000
THIS DOESN'T EVEN COVER
HALF OF WHAT YOU BORROWED.

165
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:30,366
- IS IT TRUE YOU AND DEEDS GANG
HAVE SOME KIND OF PROBLEM?

166
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:32,566
- WELL SIR, THEY'RE
THE ONES MESSING WITH US.

167
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,366
AND IT'S KIND OF
ANNOYING, YOU KNOW.

168
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,166
IF YOU COULD EVER
TALK TO THEM MR. DESCARTES,

169
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:38,600
WE SURE WOULD APPRECIATE IT.

170
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:39,866
- ( gunshots )

171
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:46,800
- DAMN. HE JUMPED
THE GUN AGAIN. THE IDIOT.

172
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:49,866
LOOK GUYS, I'LL TALK
TO DEED, ALL RIGHT?

173
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,233
SO, SEE YOU NEXT MONTH.

174
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,766
- YES, SIR. THANK YOU, SIR.

175
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,166
- NEXT TIME, FOR SURE, RIGHT?
YOU PROMISE ME, HARRY?

176
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:05,366
- OF COURSE. CROSS MY HEART.

177
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,733
- THEN I'LL BE WAITING.

178
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,700
- I'LL CALL YOU.
- GOOD NIGHT, HARRY.

179
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,366
- GOOD NIGHT, KATHERINE.

180
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:18,233
I LOVE YOU, DOLL. SEE YOU.

181
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,400
- ( car drives away )

182
00:11:21,466 --> 00:11:23,666
- YOU THINK DESCARTES IS
REALLY GONNA TALK TO DEED?

183
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:25,600
COME ON, GIVE ME A BREAK.

184
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:32,000
- GOT BACK SAFE
AND SOUND, I SEE.

185
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,833
- YOU BETTER GET HER HOME
FAST BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

186
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,066
- YO, MARIA.
- Maria: GOOD EVENING.

187
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:42,333
I SAW YOU EARLIER WHEN YOU WERE
FIGHTING THAT BUNCH OF GUYS.

188
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,433
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT WHAT
MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU.

189
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,233
I MEAN, I DIDN'T
THINK THEY'D WIN.

190
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,166
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE FINE, BUT...

191
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:49,733
NOW I AM SURE.

192
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:58,133
- COME ON. STOP TALKING
AND GO SOMEWHERE, WILL YOU?

193
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,133
- SO SHE GETS THIS BOOB JOB.
IT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE THEIR...

194
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,733
HUH?

195
00:12:08,233 --> 00:12:10,233
HEY, YOU WANT SOME
REPAIR WORK DONE,

196
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,000
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

197
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:15,000
THIS SHOP'S BEEN OUT
OF BUSINESS FOR A LONG TIME.

198
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,600
- YOU DEAF OR SOMETHING?

199
00:12:18,966 --> 00:12:20,300
- ( men screaming )

200
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:22,833
- HUH?

201
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,066
- WHAT THE HELL?
- HEY!

202
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:29,500
- HEY DEED. WHAT KIND OF
GANG YOU RUNNING HERE?

203
00:12:29,566 --> 00:12:31,366
YOU BETTER TEACH YOUR
GUYS SOME MANNERS.

204
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:33,666
- Deed: BIG BROTHER!

205
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,266
- Maria: BRANDON...
LISTEN TO ME.

206
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:48,800
WHY DON'T YOU QUIT?
WHY DO YOU KEEP FIGHTING?

207
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:56,933
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK, I CAN
ASK MY UNCLE TO INTRODUCE YOU

208
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,866
TO SOME OF THE
PEOPLE HE KNOWS.

209
00:12:58,933 --> 00:13:01,666
YOU COULD DO IT,
IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO.

210
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:02,966
THOSE FRIENDS OF YOURS...

211
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:06,666
THEY MEAN A LOT TO YOU?

212
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:08,366
BRANDON?

213
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:13,700
OF COURSE...
OF COURSE THEY DO.

214
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:28,466
- Brandon: I'LL TAKE YOU HOME.

215
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:44,233
- ( doorbell rings )

216
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,000
- WELL, YOU GOT
HOME LATE, MARIA.

217
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,766
- I'M SORRY TO BARGE IN
ON YOU LIKE THIS.

218
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,933
HOWEVER THE REASON FOR
COMING HERE TONIGHT

219
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,333
MADE IT UNAVOIDABLE.

220
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,666
WE'VE COME TO DELIVER
A MESSAGE FROM BIG DADDY.

221
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:02,400
- COME ON INSIDE.

222
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:11,133
- HEY, KENNY!
- HUH? SCOTT, YOU BASTARD.

223
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,066
THAT TIP YOU GAVE
ME WAS WORTHLESS.

224
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:14,833
I COULDN'T GET A CENT
FOR THAT THING.

225
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,433
- I'M SORRY, I'M A BIT
ABSENT MINDED.

226
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,966
SO, I'M GONNA MAKE IT UP
TO YOU WITH A HOT TIP.

227
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:21,466
THE BEST YOU EVER GOT.

228
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:24,066
- THANKS TO YOU, I CANT AFFORD
IT, YOU CHEAP SCUMBAG.

229
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:26,900
- NO CHARGE. JUST CALL IT
CUSTOMER SERVICE KID.

230
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:27,733
- HMM?

231
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,833
YOU'RE A TARGET.

232
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,900
MILANDA'S GUYS ARE OUT
LOOKING FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

233
00:14:32,966 --> 00:14:34,933
- ( tires screeching )

234
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:45,566
- LET GO OF ME, YOU BASTARD.
- SORRY, PAL.

235
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:48,766
IT'S CALLED YOU SCRATCH MY BACK,
I'LL SCRATCH YOURS.

236
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:52,033
- GOOD NIGHT, THEN.

237
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:03,300
- ( footsteps approach )

238
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:04,333
- HUH?

239
00:15:06,566 --> 00:15:08,300
- ( chuckles )

240
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:12,200
- UNCLE...

241
00:15:12,266 --> 00:15:15,933
- MARIA, I TOLD YOU NOT TO SEE
THAT GUY AGAIN, DIDN'T I?

242
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,200
- BUT...

243
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:21,400
- I WANT YOU TO LEAVE MY NIECE
ALONE, YOU UNDERSTAND?

244
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:22,666
- UNCLE!

245
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:27,166
- YOUNG MAN, I DON'T LIKE YOU.
OR THE GROUP YOU HANG OUT WITH.

246
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:38,700
- BRANDON...

247
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,300
- FIRST YOU GET YOUR ASS KICKED,

248
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:46,600
THEN YOU RUN LIKE
A SHAMELESS COWARD.

249
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,100
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ME IN AGES

250
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,800
AND YOU DARE TO TELL A
PATHETIC STORY LIKE THAT.

251
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,700
- I'M SORRY.

252
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,233
- FACT IS,
YOU'RE A PIECE OF TRASH.

253
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,366
BUT YOU'RE STILL MY BROTHER.
SO I'VE GOT NO CHOICE.

254
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:02,100
AIN'T THAT RIGHT?

255
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,833
YOU DISGRACED OUR NAME.

256
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,066
IT'S MY DUTY TO RESTORE
OUR FAMILY'S HONOR.

257
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,366
- HEY, BRANDON.

258
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:15,100
SEEMS YOU'RE TAKING QUITE
A LIKING TO THAT THING.

259
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,933
- FORGET IT. NO WAY YOU'RE...
- HARRY!

260
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,600
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?
- IT'S KENNY. THEY GOT HIM.

261
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,966
- THEY DID?
- DO YOU KNOW WHO TOOK HIM?

262
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:24,466
- MILANDA.

263
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:26,466
THE NECKLACE HE STOLE
THE OTHER DAY,

264
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:28,666
IT CAME FROM MILANDA'S STORE.

265
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:31,333
- HE STOLE IT FROM
MILANDA? THAT STUPID KID.

266
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,833
NOBODY STEALS FROM HER.

267
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,400
NOT IF THEY WANT TO
KEEP BREATHING.

268
00:16:34,466 --> 00:16:37,366
THE BITCH SAYS ONE WORD AND THE
WHOLE MOB STOPS IN IT'S TRACKS.

269
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:38,433
- WHAT DO WE DO?

270
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,000
- WELL, HOW THE HELL
SHOULD I KNOW?

271
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,533
- ( jingles )

272
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,100
- SO WE TAKE IT BACK TO HER?

273
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:48,866
- YEAH, RIGHT.

274
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:51,233
- HEY, DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE
GOING TO SEE MILANDA.

275
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,533
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

276
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,500
- WHY NOT?

277
00:16:53,566 --> 00:16:55,166
- WHAT THE HELL DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

278
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:56,700
YOU THINK SHE'S JUST
GONNA FORGIVE HIM

279
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,600
BECAUSE WE'RE RETURNING
WHAT HE STOLE?

280
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,633
- KENNY DID SOMETHING STUPID.
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

281
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,800
SO WHAT, HE'S ONE OF US, RIGHT?

282
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:10,700
- OH, MAN!
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT...

283
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:14,033
- I'LL GO TOO.

284
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,500
- YOU IDIOT, YOURS STAYIN' HERE.
- BUT, I, UH...

285
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:19,233
- YOUR JOB IS TO MAKE SURE

286
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,200
THERE'S A GOOD MEAL
WAITING FOR US.

287
00:17:22,266 --> 00:17:23,966
DINNER FOR FIVE, ALL RIGHT?

288
00:17:26,866 --> 00:17:29,000
- YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

289
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:31,233
- UNBELIEVABLE...
WHAT AN IDIOT!

290
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:33,966
- HEY, YOU'RE THE IDIOT.

291
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,266
- SO ARE YOU.

292
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,800
- HEY, WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT!

293
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:41,133
EVEN THE SKY IS LOOKING
PRETTY GLOOMY.

294
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:43,266
- ( sighs )

295
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,133
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET HOME.

296
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,366
- ( thunder rumbling )

297
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:59,100
- Milanda: START TALKING.
THE TRUTH THIS TIME.

298
00:18:01,466 --> 00:18:03,133
NOW TELL ME WHERE
YOU'VE HIDDEN THE ITEM

299
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,900
YOU STOLE FROM MY STORE.

300
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:08,800
LIKE I ALREADY TOLD YOU, MA'AM,
I SOLD IT A LONG TIME AGO.

301
00:18:08,866 --> 00:18:10,800
- IMPOSSIBLE. I'D HAVE KNOWN.

302
00:18:10,866 --> 00:18:12,800
THE OPERATIVES IN MY
INTELLIGENCE NETWORK

303
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:14,266
ARE EXPERTS.

304
00:18:17,466 --> 00:18:20,800
YOU WANT TO STRIKE BACK,
DON'T YOU? BE MY GUEST.

305
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,533
IF YOU'VE GOT THE GUTS
TO DO IT.

306
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:24,366
( laughs )

307
00:18:25,366 --> 00:18:27,866
IF NOT, PLEASE DON'T
WASTE ANY MORE TIME.

308
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:29,566
I LOVE TO KEEP PEOPLE WAITING.

309
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:32,366
I HOWEVER REFUSE TO
WAIT FOR ANYONE.

310
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:34,233
- ( clicks )

311
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,966
- NOW, ANSWER ME.

312
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:41,133
HURRY.

313
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,200
- ( grunts )

314
00:18:43,266 --> 00:18:44,533
- ( men screaming )

315
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,866
- WHAT IS IT NOW?

316
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:50,133
- SORRY TO DISTURB YOU
SO LATE AT NIGHT.

317
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:55,233
SORRY ABOUT THE RUDE ENTRANCE,
MRS. MILANDA. FORGIVE US.

318
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,100
- MISS MILANDA.

319
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,733
- PLEASE ACCEPT MY
SINCERE APOLOGY.

320
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,933
- WHO ARE YOU?

321
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,333
- THAT YOUNG MAN ON THE FLOOR
STOLE SOMETHING FROM YOU.

322
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,400
I CAME HERE TONIGHT
TO RETURN IT.

323
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,000
- EXPECTING A REWARD?

324
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:18,066
- FOR A JEWEL LIKE THAT?
NATURALLY, I'D BE A FOOL NOT TO.

325
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:22,100
- I LIKE HONESTY. SO,
WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?

326
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,966
- WHEN I LEAVE TONIGHT...

327
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:27,900
I WAS HOPING YOU'D ALLOW THIS
YOUNG MAN HERE TO COME WITH ME.

328
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,633
- ( Milanda laughs )

329
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,833
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU CAME
HERE TO RESCUE HIM

330
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,066
AFTER HE WAS STUPID ENOUGH

331
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:35,300
TO STEAL MY
MERCHANDISE, CORRECT?

332
00:19:35,366 --> 00:19:38,166
- YES, MA'AM.
YOU'RE SHARP AS A TACK.

333
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:41,700
BUT IN ADDITION, JUST TO PROVE
TO YOU HOW GRATEFUL I AM,

334
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:43,766
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HAVE ME AS WELL?

335
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,000
- HMM.

336
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:47,066
- I'VE BEEN POLISHING
MY SKILLS.

337
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:48,333
I'M IN GREAT SHAPE.

338
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,466
NOT TO MENTION
PRETTY GOOD LOOKING.

339
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:54,200
REST ASSURED, YOU'LL
HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME.

340
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:57,066
IN FACT, I GUARANTEE IT.

341
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:03,133
- I SEE. SOUNDS EXCITING.

342
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:07,766
WELL THEN, I'LL LEAVE
THE REST TO YOU.

343
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,433
- RIGHT.

344
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,200
- IT DIDN'T WORK HARRY,
NOW WHAT?

345
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:15,600
- I'M IN SHOCK.
- OH, GREAT!

346
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:16,900
- ( guns click )

347
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:25,766
- OH, BY THE WAY...

348
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:45,200
- HEY, ARE YOU GUYS ALIVE?

349
00:20:45,266 --> 00:20:47,866
- I FEEL LIKE I'M ABOUT
TO DIE OR WORSE,

350
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:49,466
LIKE I'M ALREADY DEAD.

351
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:51,133
- DAMN THAT BITCH.

352
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,766
SHE HAD THEM WORK
US OVER OUT HERE,

353
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,433
SO THEY WOULDN'T
STAIN HER CARPET.

354
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,066
TO THAT BITCH, OUR LIVES
ARE WORTH LESS THAN A RUG!

355
00:20:57,133 --> 00:21:00,100
- SO, YOU'D RATHER DIE THAN BE
THOUGHT OF AS WORTHLESS...

356
00:21:00,866 --> 00:21:02,200
- HEY, BRANDON...

357
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:06,366
BRANDON?

358
00:21:09,466 --> 00:21:12,800
BRANDON! COME ON, BRANDON.
SNAP OUT OF IT.

359
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:31,066
- ( door opens )

360
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:32,466
- HEY, WELCOME BACK...

361
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:40,433
- YEAH, I'M BACK.

362
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,333
- MY FORTUNE TELLING
CARDS WERE RIGHT.

363
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,266
THIS WAS THE WORST DAY EVER.

364
00:21:49,866 --> 00:21:52,900
- JUST ONE OF YOU?
HOW DISAPPOINTING.

365
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,833
HMM. WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

366
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,500
- ( gun shot )

367
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,533
- Brandon: ORDINARY.
EVERYTHING WAS ORDINARY.

368
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,033
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT,

369
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:30,133
THAT THE DEAD MAN IN FRONT
OF OUR EYES WAS ONE OF US.

370
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,700
TO ANYONE ELSE,
AN INSIGNIFICANT SCENE...

371
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:36,266
IN A PLACE WHERE THINGS
LIKE THIS WERE COMMON PLACE.

372
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,633
THEY WERE NOTHING MORE
THAN ORDINARY.

373
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:47,533
- ( pop song playing )

374
00:22:57,866 --> 00:23:00,266
- ( man singing )

375
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,900
- Brandon: ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HE WAS GONE.

376
00:24:17,966 --> 00:24:20,766
LEAVING NOTHING
BUT A VAGUE MEMORY.

377
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:24,166
NOW, IT'S RAINING ON PLACES
WHERE THERE IS NO FREEDOM.

378
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:28,300
RAINING ENDLESSLY. AS IF
IT WILL WASH OUR LIVES AWAY.
