1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,400
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:17,900
- ( gun cocks )

3
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,733
- ( alarm blares )

4
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:34,166
- ( men shouting )

5
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,966
- ( groaning )

6
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:55,133
( shouts, growls )

7
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,433
- ( gunshots )

8
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:02,066
- ( grunts )

9
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:04,700
- ( gunfire continues )

10
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,700
- ( grunts )
- ( shouts )

11
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,733
- ( groans )

12
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,733
- WHY?

13
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,633
WHY IS IT THAT YOU ALONE CAN
DESTROY MY ORGMEN SO EASILY?

14
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,166
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

15
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:39,133
DOES THIS MEAN THAT
I'M INFERIOR TO DR. TOKIOKA?!

16
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:44,066
BEYOND THE GRAVE!

17
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,466
- Mika: THE WHOLE CITY
IS AT A STANDSTILL.

18
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:17,266
GRAVE SHUT IT DOWN
ALL BY HIMSELF.

19
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:24,066
- HEY.

20
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,833
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
PARTNER?

21
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,066
YOU'RE NOT AS PERKY
AS USUAL.

22
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:29,500
WHAT'S UP?

23
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:32,500
YOU GETTING HUNGRY
OR SOMETHING?

24
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:33,966
THAT'S IT, ISN'T IT?

25
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:35,566
YOU'RE GETTING HUNGRY, HUH?

26
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:38,166
YOU WANT A MEAL,
DON'T YOU?

27
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:40,166
A NICE, WARM MEAL.

28
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:43,166
THAT SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD,
DOESN'T IT?

29
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:46,033
WELL, THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

30
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:53,133
- HARRY, DARLING?

31
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,800
HARRY?

32
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:56,100
WHAT'S WRONG?

33
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:03,533
I'M BEGGING YOU, HARRY,

34
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,300
LISTEN TO ME.
PLEASE, LISTEN!

35
00:05:05,366 --> 00:05:06,533
- HMM?

36
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,200
WHAT WAS THAT, SHERRY?

37
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:11,166
- DON'T GIVE ME THAT.
YOU HEARD ME.

38
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:16,866
YOU'VE BEEN SO ODD LATELY.

39
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:19,133
COME ON, HARRY.
TELL ME WHAT'S THE MATTER.

40
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,766
- NOTHING.
- HARRY,

41
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,000
I CAN ALWAYS TELL WHEN
SOMETHING'S BOTHERING YOU.

42
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:25,200
PLEASE TELL ME WHAT
YOU'RE SO WORRIED ABOUT.

43
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:27,233
- LIKE I SAID,

44
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,233
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT ANYTHING.

45
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,900
- ARE YOU REALLY SURE?

46
00:05:30,966 --> 00:05:32,233
- YES, I'M SURE.

47
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,233
- REALLY?

48
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,566
EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT THEN?

49
00:05:36,633 --> 00:05:37,900
I'VE JUST BEEN SO WORRIED

50
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:40,033
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN YOURSELF LATELY.

51
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,166
- FORGIVE ME.

52
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:42,700
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

53
00:05:42,766 --> 00:05:45,700
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING YOU'VE GOT
TO PROMISE ME, HARRY, OKAY?

54
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:48,366
- WHAT IS IT?

55
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:51,233
- PROMISE ME YOU WON'T
DIE BEFORE I DO.

56
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,866
THAT YOU WON'T LEAVE ME
BEHIND ALL ALONE.

57
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:56,200
- SURE.
YOU HAVE MY WORD ON IT.

58
00:05:56,266 --> 00:05:58,866
- EXCUSE ME,
MASTER MACDOWEL.

59
00:05:58,933 --> 00:05:59,900
- HMM?

60
00:05:59,966 --> 00:06:02,266
YES, HARRISON?

61
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,900
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

62
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:05,733
- MASTER MACDOWEL,

63
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,900
I AM-- I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT--

64
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:10,500
- ( gasps )

65
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:12,933
- I'M VERY SORRY ABOUT THIS.

66
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,600
VERY SORRY INDEED.

67
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,033
- ( gunshot )

68
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,000
- ( gasps, groans )

69
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,200
- THE OVERKILLS,
JUST IN TIME.

70
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:32,133
- WE OVERKILLS
WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN

71
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,300
TO CARRY OUT BEAR WALKEN'S
INSTRUCTIONS

72
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:37,000
TO KEEP YOU AND MRS. MACDOWEL
OUT OF HARM'S WAY.

73
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:39,666
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

74
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,933
- THANKS A LOT.

75
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,266
I'M COUNTING ON YOU GUYS.

76
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,300
- DON'T MENTION IT, SIR.
- IT'S OUR PLEASURE.

77
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:46,300
- SHERRY,

78
00:06:46,366 --> 00:06:48,166
THEY SAY I'M GOOD
AT WHAT I DO,

79
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:49,766
BUT I'M NO MATCH
FOR YOUR FATHER.

80
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:54,566
- THANK YOU, DADDY.

81
00:06:58,033 --> 00:06:59,500
- BY THE WAY, PARKER,

82
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:02,266
WHAT'S BECOME OF YOUR PLAN
FOR HARRY'S ASSASSINATION?

83
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,766
- IT FAILED.

84
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,333
UNFORTUNATELY, THE OVERKILLS

85
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,466
APPEAR TO BE ON
HARRY'S SIDE NOW.

86
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:09,800
- A TRICKY SITUATION.

87
00:07:09,866 --> 00:07:11,300
- THEY'RE HIGHLY SKILLED,

88
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:13,466
BUT THERE'S LESS THAN
A DOZEN OF THEM LEFT.

89
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,766
THERE'S NO WAY
THEY CAN STOP US.

90
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,600
WHAT'LL WE DO
ABOUT THE ORGMEN?

91
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:19,000
- RIGHT.  THOSE THINGS
ARE PROGRAMMED TO FOLLOW

92
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:20,533
WHATEVER ORDERS
HARRY GIVES THEM.

93
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,766
THEY NEVER SURRENDER.

94
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,666
- WE FOUND A FORMER
LAB TECHNICIAN

95
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:25,200
WHO'S HELPING US WITH THAT.

96
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:27,933
PRODUCTION OF A SPECIAL
COUNTER ORGMEN HYBRID PROTOTYPE

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,600
HAS ALREADY BEGUN.

98
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:33,600
PARKER, WHICH EXECUTIVES
CAN WE COUNT ON FOR SUPPORT?

99
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,933
- WE'VE CONVINCED
WALTER, DANIEL, AND NICK

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,333
THAT IT WOULD BE
BEST TO JOIN US.

101
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,500
- BRIAN, ANTHONY, AND STEVE
WILL JOIN US

102
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:42,566
WHENEVER WE'RE READY
TO MAKE OUR MOVE.

103
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:46,366
- WHICH MEANS ONLY
PETE AND ERIC ARE LEFT.

104
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:47,766
- LEAVE THOSE TWO TO ME.

105
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,533
I'LL HAVE A TALK WITH THEM.

106
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,833
THEY'RE REASONABLE MEN.

107
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,033
I'M SURE I CAN
CONVINCE THEM.

108
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,066
MEANWHILE...
- MEANWHILE?

109
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:59,700
- MEANWHILE,
DON'T INTERFERE WITH THE TARGET.

110
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:03,066
JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE AND LET
HIM DO WHAT HE WANTS TO DO.

111
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:05,733
- I DON'T THINK THAT'S
A VERY GOOD IDEA.

112
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,033
HE'S PARALYZED
THE ENTIRE CITY.

113
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,833
IF WE REMAIN VULNERABLE,

114
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,700
IT WILL INVITE COMPETITION
AND INTERFERENCE

115
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:13,833
FROM OTHER ORGANIZATIONS.

116
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,666
- THEY'LL FIND OUT WE'RE
NOT QUITE AS VULNERABLE

117
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:20,266
AS THEY THINK.
OUR TARGET IS NO LONGER HIM.

118
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,500
IT'S HARRY MACDOWEL'S
MILLENNION.

119
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,700
WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK,
RIGHT, BIG DADDY?

120
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,466
- ( tires screech )

121
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,500
- ( both gasp )

122
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:01,800
- ( gasps )
- ( grunts )

123
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,033
- ( gunfire )

124
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,000
- IAN!  EVANS!

125
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,033
HEY, KYNE?

126
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,533
- HUH?

127
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,900
- ( both grunt )

128
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:16,700
- ( gunfire continues )

129
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:18,466
- ( groans )

130
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:26,033
- ( screams )

131
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,533
- BACK US OUT OF HERE NOW!

132
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:38,333
- ( grunts )

133
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,166
- ( whimpers, cries )

134
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,566
- WHAT NOW, GRAVE?

135
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:37,533
YOU GONNA LEAVE AGAIN?

136
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,533
IS IT USELESS
TRYING TO STOP YOU?

137
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:53,800
GRAVE?

138
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:56,866
ARE THE TWO OF US...

139
00:10:56,933 --> 00:10:58,733
HAVE WE BECOME A FAMILY?

140
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,266
- YEAH.

141
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,266
- ( chuckles )

142
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,200
THEN I KNOW YOU'LL COME BACK.

143
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:12,533
YOU'LL COME BACK
TO YOUR FAMILY. 

144
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,000
I BELIEVE THAT.

145
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,166
( gasps )

146
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:21,833
YOUR BODY...

147
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,066
WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOU?

148
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:57,666
- I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT.

149
00:11:57,733 --> 00:11:59,033
- NO WAY.

150
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,066
IF YOU LEAVE LIKE THIS,
YOU'LL NEVER COME BACK.

151
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:03,266
DON'T GO.

152
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,900
OH, PLEASE, DON'T GO!

153
00:12:07,566 --> 00:12:09,300
FORGET REVENGE
AND MILLENNION

154
00:12:09,366 --> 00:12:10,433
AND BLOODY HARRY.

155
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,833
WE CAN PUT ALL THAT
BEHIND US, PLEASE? 

156
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,633
WE'LL GO AWAY,
JUST THE TWO OF US.

157
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,500
SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY FROM HERE.

158
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:18,233
NO MATTER HOW HARD IT IS,

159
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,500
I'LL NEVER GIVE UP.

160
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:20,700
I'LL SURVIVE ON NOTHING MORE

161
00:12:20,766 --> 00:12:22,500
THAN BREAD AND WATER
IF I HAVE TO.

162
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:24,566
I'LL STUDY HARD
AND LEARN BIO-MECHANICS

163
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:27,233
AND TAKE CARE OF YOU
LIKE DR. TOKIOKA.

164
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,966
DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE.

165
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:30,966
OH, PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T GO!

166
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:33,066
( sobs )

167
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:41,733
- MIKA, I'M SORRY.

168
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:45,466
I HAVE NO FUTURE.
NOT ANYMORE.

169
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:48,533
MY FUTURE'S DEAD,
JUST LIKE ME.

170
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,933
- YOU'RE NOT.

171
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,600
YOU'RE NOT DEAD,
I KNOW IT.

172
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,033
I KNOW IT!

173
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,033
- YOU'RE THE STRONGEST
PERSON I KNOW.

174
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,066
YOU CAN MAKE IT
ON YOUR OWN.

175
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:00,333
- OH, GRAVE.

176
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,666
- MIKA...

177
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:04,566
I HAVE TO GO NOW,
UNDERSTAND?

178
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:06,666
- DON'T GO.

179
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:09,066
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.

180
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:11,000
BECAUSE...

181
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:13,366
BECAUSE...

182
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:14,966
I LOVE YOU.

I LOVE YOU.

187
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:25,033
THAT'S WHY I DON'T
WANT YOU TO GO.

188
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,366
PLEASE, GRAVE.

189
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:30,333
PLEASE, DON'T GO.
( crying )

190
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,366
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A GREAT LIFE...

191
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:35,700
WITHOUT ME.

192
00:13:35,766 --> 00:13:38,366
TODAY AND TOMORROW,

193
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:40,333
AND FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

194
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,100
THERE'S NO CHOICE.

196
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:51,033

BUNJI KUGASHIRA.

205
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:29,033

I'M READY WHENEVER YOU ARE,
BIG GUY.

( chuckles )

208
00:15:54,566 --> 00:15:57,233
- SHERRY, I WANT YOU TO
STAY HERE AT THE HOTEL 

209
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,466
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

210
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:00,500
- ONLY IF YOU'LL TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE UP TO.

211
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:02,866
- JUST SOME BUSINESS 
MATTERS TO ATTEND TO.

212
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:05,400
I NEED TO FIND OUT
WHICH OF OUR EXECUTIVES

213
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:07,600
HIRED THOSE THUGS
WHO ATTACKED US TODAY,

214
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,333
AND THEN MAKE CERTAIN THAT
THE TRAITOR IS SUITABLY PUNISHED

215
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,933
FOR BREAKING
THE CODE OF IRON.

216
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,600
- IT'S TOO DANGEROUS, HARRY.

217
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,066
- SO WHAT SHOULD I DO?
RUN?

218
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:17,533
AS LONG AS I'M THE BOSS,

219
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,133
TRAITORS WILL GET 
WHAT THEY DESERVE.

220
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,200
PLEASE TAKE GOOD CARE OF HER.

221

- JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE,
DEAR.

224
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,200
WE SWORE TO EACH OTHER
THAT WE WOULD BE TOGETHER

225
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:34,100
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES,
AND WE WILL.

226

I'LL-- I'LL GET A DOCTOR
HERE AS FAST AS I CAN.

243
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,533
DON'T BE AFRAID.
IT'S NOTHING SERIOUS.

244
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,733
IT'S JUST A SCRATCH.

245
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,300
A LITTLE FLESH WOUND.

246
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:41,066
RIGHT, SWEETHEART?

247
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,566

WELL, BIG GUY,

WHAT DO YOU SAY WE END
THIS THING ONCE AND FOR ALL?

SORRY IT HAD TO
END THIS WAY, BUNJI.

KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

- SO I GUESS THIS IS
FINALLY IT THEN.

WHAT I REMEMBER IS WHAT
HE SAID BACK THEN.

FROM THE PAST,

AND THE ENCOUNTER 
THAT THEY CREATED.
