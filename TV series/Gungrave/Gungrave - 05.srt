1
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:12,066
( theme music playing )

2
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,000
- ( inaudible )

3
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,966
- MAGRID OIL COMPANY...

4
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:56,633
MAGRID IS HUGE. IT'S ONE OF
THE BIGGEST OIL COMPANIES

5
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,900
IN THE WORLD.

6
00:01:57,966 --> 00:02:00,200
- COME ON. LET'S GO
UP TO MY OFFICE.

7
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:04,033
- YOU MEAN IN THERE?
- RIGHT.

8
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:11,266
- ( laughs )

9
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,500
AWESOME! MILLENNION IS
AN AMAZING ORGANIZATION!

10
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:18,266
- Brandon: MILLENNION,

11
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:21,400
IF YOU'LL PARDON THE CLICHE,
IS ORGANIZED CRIME.

12
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:23,500
A CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION.

13
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:25,966
IT'S THE PREVAILING
POWER IN THIS TOWN.

14
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:28,200
CONTROLLING THE
UNDERGROUND COMMUNITY

15
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:31,633
AS WELL AS OPERATING
CORPORATIONS, TRADING FIRMS,

16
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,666
BANKS AS FRONTS FOR
IT'S CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES.

17
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:36,700
PREFFERING TO WORK
BEHIND THE SCENES,

18
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:39,366
IT'S OFTEN CALLED
"AUTHORITY OF THE SHADOWS"

19
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:43,166
AND HAS ENORMOUS INFLUENCE IN
ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CIRCLES.

20
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:44,833
INCLUDING PERIPHERAL GROUPS,

21
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,100
IT CONSISTS OF APPROXIMATELY
8,000 MEMBERS,

22
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:52,033
OUT OF THOSE 8,000, THERE ARE
140 THAT THE BOSS, "BIG DADDY",

23
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,666
CONSIDERS THE FAMILY.

24
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:56,633
HIS ELITE INNER CIRCLE.

25
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:02,033
RANDY, THE GUY WHO BROUGHT
US HERE, IS ONE OF THEM.

26
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,533
HUGE AND ENORMOUSLY
POWERFUL MILLENNION.

27
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,333
BUT BACK THEN, I WASN'T THINKING
ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION.

28
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:16,200
ALL I WAS THINKING ABOUT WAS
MY PARTNER, STANDING NEXT TO ME.

29
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:20,033
AND MARIA.

30
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:24,266
IT WASN'T UNTIL I
MET THAT PERSON

31
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,266
THAT I STARTED
THINKING SERIOUSLY,

32
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,466
ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION
CALLED MILLENNION.

33
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,500
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT PERSON.

34
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:54,833
- ( commentator
indistinct on tv )

35
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,733
THERE ARE ONLY 30
YARDS TO THE FINISH LINE

36
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,433
AND THE UNDERDOG HAS
CLOSED THE GAP.

37
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,900
NOW HE'S NECK AND NECK
AND LOOK AT HIM GO.

38
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:04,300
HE'S COMING! THE WINNER IS
NUMBER 3, MICHAEL STAMPEDE!

39
00:04:04,366 --> 00:04:06,866
AN AMAZING FINISH,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

40
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:10,433
- HEY, BOSS!
NUMBER 3 BEAT NUMBER 2!

41
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,733
- WHICH MEANS ANTHONY BLEW
30,000 ON THIS RACE.

42
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,933
HE'LL BE CALLING
ANY SECOND NOW.

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,800
- ( phone rings )

44
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:19,766
- THERE HE IS! THAT NEW FACE,

45
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,233
TELL HIM WE'LL LOAN HIM
AS MUCH AS HE WANTS!

46
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,566
WELL, SAY SOMETHING,
WILL YOU?

47
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,200
- GOOD AFTERNOON.

48
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:33,900
- YOU IDIOT.

49
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:35,933
HOW MANY TIMES DO
I NEED TO TELL YOU?

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,500
THE RACING PHONE'S ON THE RIGHT.

51
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:39,566
THE MIDDLE ONE'S FOR
BLACK MARKET STUFF.

52
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:43,133
AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT
IS FOR INTERNAL USE!

53
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,166
- WHY DON'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?
- I'M SORRY.

54
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:48,533
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I SAID...

55
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,633
- NAMES BRANDON HEAT...

56
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,300
- STRANGE NAME FOR A GUY
WHO'S COOL AND CALM.

57
00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:53,633
- ( phone rings )

58
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,433
- WHEN YOU PICK UP THE PHONE...
- TALK TO ME.

59
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,600
- YOU PISS ME OFF,
YOU KNOW THAT? HEY!

60
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,466
- YEAH, IT'S ME. WHAT'S UP?
- I'M TALKING TO YOU!

61
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,900
- YEAH, I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

62
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,766
- SO, WHAT'S UP, BOSS?

63
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:07,066
- IT'S A TIP FROM GWEN.

64
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:11,066
THAT'S SCALPER CARLASON. DIDN'T
PAY BACK THE 60,000 HE OWES US.

65
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:14,100
HE DIDN'T SHOW UP AT THE TRACK.

66
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,866
- LET'S GO, NEW FACE.
IT'S DROP-IN TIME.

67
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,833
- LOOKS LIKE THE BASTARD
JUST GOT BACK, BOSS.

68
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,866
- ALL RIGHT.

69
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,033
NEW FACE,

70
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,900
GARY AND I ARE GOING TO GO
IN TOGETHER FROM THE FRONT.

71
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:40,633
YOU KEEP AN EYE ON
THE BACK DOOR IN CASE

72
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,466
HE TRIES TO GIVE US THE SLIP.

73
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:45,000
NOW DON'T GET NERVOUS.

74
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:47,766
IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY,
YOU CAN USE THIS.

75
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:52,000
BUT ONLY IF IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

76
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,200
- YOU'RE READY?
- YEAH.

77
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:09,100
- ( glass breaks )

78
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,700
- ( woman screams )

79
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:11,900
- HE'S COMING YOUR WAY!

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,200
- THAT'S HIM!

81
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,200
- WHO THE HELL'S
THIS PUNK?

82
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,766
OUT OF MY WAY, YOU BASTARD!

83
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,900
( screams )

84
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:38,666
YOU BASTARD! WHERE THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?

85
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:43,466
- OH, MAN!

86
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:47,200
- NICE GOING, BRANDON HEAT.
YOU LIVE UP TO YOUR NAME.

87
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,333
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT SOME
FIRE IN YOU AFTER ALL.

88
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,866
GOOD.

89
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:55,533
- SAY SOMETHING, WILL YOU?

90
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:58,033
- THANK YOU.

91
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,733
- ( laughs )

92
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:04,233
- Brandon: RIGHT AFTER
I JOINED MILLENNION,

93
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,366
I GOT MY FIRST ASSIGNMENT.

94
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:09,566
I WAS TOLD TO GO TO A ROOM
IN A RUN DOWN BUILDING

95
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:12,633
ON THE WEST SIDE OF TOWN.

96
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,466
I LIVED AND WORKED AS PART OF A
CREW WHOSE JOB WAS TO COLLECT

97
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:19,433
MONEY FOR THE ORGANIZATION.

98
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,466
MILLENNION'S INCOME IN THIS
PARTICULAR DISTRICT CAME FROM

99
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:25,833
THE OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT
OF ILLEGAL RACE TRACK BETTING.

100
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,033
AND THE BLACK MARKET FINANCING
THAT WENT ALONG WITH IT.

101
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,700
THEY GAVE HIGH INTEREST LOANS
TO GAMBLERS AND WHEN THEY'D LOSE

102
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:35,333
WE KEPT RAISING THE INTEREST
RATES UNTIL THEY PAID US BACK.

103
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,533
IT WAS EXTORTION.

104
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,100
IF THEY DENIED THE DEBT
OR DIDN'T MAKE PAYMENTS ON TIME

105
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,366
WE DROPPED IN ON THEM.
WE DID THE SAME THING,

106
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:45,366
OVER AND OVER AGAIN

107
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:47,600
I FOUND IT TROUBLING AT FIRST.

108
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:51,200
BUT AFTER A WHILE, I LEARNED TO
HANDLE IT IN MY OWN WAY.

109
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:58,400
I WONDER IF HARRY WAS DOING
THE SAME THING SOMEPLACE ELSE.

110
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:01,800
I HADN'T SEEN HIM SINCE
WE PARTED WAYS THAT DAY.

111
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,200
AND I HADN'T
SEEN MARIA EITHER...

112
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,933
IT WENT ON THAT WAY
FOR NEARLY FOUR MONTHS.

113
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,300
- THE GUY WE'RE MEETING
IS ONE OF THE COLLECTORS.

114
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:23,600
THEY TAKE THE MONEY WE MAKE
TO ONE OF OUR AFFILIATES.

115
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,000
A MONEY LAUNDERING OPERATION

116
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:27,433
THAT MAKE THE FUNDS
LOOK LEGITIMATE.

117
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,633
THEN OUR EXECUTIVES
CAN USE THE MONEY

118
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,933
IN WHATEVER WAY THEY CHOOSE.

119
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,966
THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS.

120
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:37,100
'COURSE, SINCE YOU ARE AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE FOOD CHAIN,

121
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:41,200
YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEED
TO KNOW ALL THAT.

122
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:42,900
YOU DON'T TALK MUCH.

123
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:46,233
MY AUNT SAYS YOU QUIET TYPES
ARE THE MOST EMOTIONAL OF ALL.

124
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,200
'CAUSE OF ALL THOSE FEELINGS
YOU HAVE. HUDDLED UP INSIDE.

125
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:51,200
YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE?

126
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,400
I GUESS YOU'RE NOT GONNA ANSWER.

127
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:57,100
( laughs )

128
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,100
- YOU COLLECTED MORE THAN USUAL
THIS MONTH. WELL DONE.

129
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,766
HERE IS YOUR SHARE.

130
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,733
I APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU, SIR.

131
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,100
- ( door opens )

132
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,833
- EXCUSE ME!

133
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,900
- YOUR TIMING
COULDN'T BE BETTER.

134
00:09:11,966 --> 00:09:14,033
PUT THIS MONEY IN THE SAFE
FOR ME, WILL YOU HARRY?

135
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:25,000
- YES, SIR.

136
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:26,200
- HERE'S YOUR CUT.

137
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,800
- THANKS.

138
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:31,366
- I'M GONNA TAKE OFF. BUT YOU
CAN STAY AS LONG AS YOU LIKE.

139
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:32,466
THERE'S NO RUSH.

140
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:35,300
LOOKS LIKE YOU TWO HAVE
SOME CATCHING UP TO DO.

141
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,600
- HEY!

142
00:09:43,766 --> 00:09:46,366
I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE VERY LONG.
ONLY ABOUT A WEEK OR SO.

143
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:48,600
SO THEY HAVEN'T GIVEN ME
A REAL ASSIGNMENT YET.

144
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,100
MOSTLY JUST ODDS AND ENDS.

145
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,933
OH, GOOD LOOKING SUIT, HUH?

146
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,100
MY BOSS TOLD ME TO GET
SOME DECENT CLOTHES.

147
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,166
YOU OUGHT TO DO THE SAME THING.
DRESS YOURSELF UP A LITTLE.

148
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,433
YOU GOT TO GET THEIR RESPECT
IF YOU WANT TO SURVIVE.

149
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:05,400
- ( both laugh )

150
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:08,200
- THIS IS IT, BRANDON.
IT'S MY FAVORITE HANGOUT.

151
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:11,533
HEY, COME ON, MAN.

152
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:23,666
I'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO A
COUPLE OF FRIENDS OF MINE.

153
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:25,966
HEY GUYS.
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

154
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:27,833
YO, HARRY. HOW YOU DOIN'?

155
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,533
I SEE YOUR APPETITE
IS AMAZING AS ALWAYS, BOB.

156
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,700
OF COURSE IT IS. IT'S MY
ONE OUTSTANDING QUALITY.

157
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,900
IF YOU TOOK THAT AWAY,
I HAVE NOTHING LEFT.

158
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,700
- SO, HARRY. THIS A
FRIEND OF YOURS?

159
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:40,500
YEAH, LET ME
INTRODUCE YOU TO HIM.

160
00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:42,400
THIS IS BRANDON HEAT,
MY BEST FRIEND.

161
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:44,666
WE JOINED THE ORGANIZATION
AT THE SAME TIME.

162
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:46,600
- HELLO, THERE.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

163
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,300
BALLADBIRD LEE ESQUIRE
AT YOUR SERVICE SIR.

164
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:51,366
BUT JUST CALL ME LEE,
ALL RIGHT?

165
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:57,133
- LEE HERE IS THE
PERSONAL ASSISTANT

166
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,566
TO THE TOP EXEC AT
ANOTHER DISTRICT.

167
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:01,400
HE'S ON OF THE
SHARPEST GUYS AROUND.

168
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:03,233
- COME ON. LOOK WHO'S TALKING.

169
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,066
TOOK ME ALMOST A YEAR AND HALF
TO GET TO WHERE I AM NOW.

170
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,533
BUT IT TOOK YOU
ONLY FOUR MONTHS.

171
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,633
SO WHEN YOU SAY HOW
GREAT YOU THINK I AM

172
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,433
IT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE SARCASM.

173
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,766
WHAT KIND OF MAGIC
GOT YOU SO FAR SO FAST?

174
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,900
- SORRY, BUT THAT'S A
COMPANY SECRET.

175
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:21,233
- HEY, LEE. OKAY WITH YOU
IF I INTRODUCE MYSELF?

176
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,133
- OF COURSE. GO AHEAD.

177
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,833
- HI, THERE. MY NAME
IS BOB POUNDMAX.

178
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,700
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU, BRANDON!

179
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:33,233
YES, INDEED, IT'S A REAL
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU ALL RIGHT.

180
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,400
- DIDN'T ANYONE TEACH YOU NOT
TO TALK WITH YOUR MOUTH FULL?

181
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:40,900
OH WELL, HE'S ALWAYS THIS WAY.

182
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,400
- YES, BUT BOB IS
A TRUE WHIZ KID.

183
00:11:43,466 --> 00:11:45,200
- UNLIKE HIS IDIOTIC APPEARANCE.

184
00:11:45,266 --> 00:11:46,466
- ( laughs )

185
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:53,166
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND? 10 MILLION,
A CHEQUE FOR 10 MILLION YULE!

186
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:55,800
AND IT'S NO BIG DEAL. CHEQUES
FOR THOSE KIND OF AMOUNTS

187
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:56,900
COME THROUGH OUR OFFICE EVERYDAY

188
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,233
AND NO ONE THINKS
TWICE ABOUT IT.

189
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,233
I NEVER COULD'VE IMAGINED HOW
AWESOME MILLENNION REALLY IS.

190
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,200
- THAT'S BECAUSE THE
TOP BOSS, BIG DADDY,

191
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,733
REALLY KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING.

192
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,766
- WHO'S BIG DADDY?

193
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,966
- RIGHT NOW, BIG DADDY IS
SO FAR OUT OF OUR LEAGUE

194
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:14,100
HE MIGHT AS WELL BE
LIVING ON MOUNT OLYMPUS.

195
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,666
BUT IF WE CAN GET INVITED
INTO THE MILLENNION FAMILY,

196
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:18,200
BIG DADDY'S INNER CIRCLE,

197
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:21,066
WE'D BE AT THE VERY CENTER
OF THE ORGANIZATION.

198
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:22,800
WE'D LEARN HOW TO
GET ENOUGH POWER

199
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:25,800
TO CONTROL THIS ENTIRE CITY.

200
00:12:25,866 --> 00:12:28,200
- IT SOUNDS LIKE AN
ATTRACTIVE PROPOSITION.

201
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:33,700
- BRANDON, LETS GO FOR IT.
GET INVITED INTO THE FAMILY.

202
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,966
- SURE.
- ME, TOO! ME, TOO!

203
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:41,433
- HEY, CUT IT OUT.
YOU'RE SPITTING FOOD.

204
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,400
- I'M SORRY, HARRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO, HONEST.

205
00:12:44,466 --> 00:12:46,333
- THEN WHY ARE YOU
STILL DOING IT?

206
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,400
- BOB'S TABLE MANNERS
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SPECTACULAR.

207
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:51,266
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LEE.

208
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,166
UM, IF YOU'RE NOT
GONNA FINISH THAT...

209
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:57,133
- SURE. HELP YOURSELF, BOB.
- ARE YOU STILL EATING?

210
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,600
- UH-HUH.
- OH!

211
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,266
- THEY SAY SCRAWNY PEOPLE
ARE THE BIGGEST EATERS,

212
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,466
BUT YOU'RE OUT OF CONTROL.

213
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,066
- YOU THINK SO?

214
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:06,366
- ( laughs )

215
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,300
- I HAVEN'T HAD THIS MUCH
FUN FOR A LONG TIME.

216
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:15,200
- ME NEITHER.

217
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:17,400
- LOOK, BRANDON,
DON'T BE A STRANGER.

218
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:18,733
LETS STAY IN TOUCH, ALL RIGHT?

219
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,966
- SURE, HARRY.

220
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:24,966
- THAT'S WHERE
WE'RE HEADED, BRANDON.

221
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:28,066
ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP
OF THE ORGANIZATION.

222
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:30,566
WE WILL BECOME PART
OF THE FAMILY.

223
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,766
- Brandon: YEAH.

224
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,833
- Gary: OKAY, OKAY. YOU'RE
BETTING 2000 ON A 4-5 EXACT

225
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,366
IN TOMORROW'S TENTH RACE.

226
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:42,933
YEAH, GOT IT.
YOU'RE ALL SET. THANKS.

227
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,100
BOSS?

228
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:52,033
- WE GOT WORK TO DO.

229
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,633
SOMEBODY PULLED OF A HEIST
AT ONE OF MILLENNION'S

230
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,100
WAREHOUSES LAST NIGHT.

231
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,466
PICKED IT CLEAN.

232
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:03,500
THEY STOLE JEWELRY
AND GOLD MOSTLY.

233
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:04,666
IF WE DON'T GET IT BACK,

234
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:07,200
THE ORGANIZATION WILL
LOSE 800,000 YULES.

235
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:09,033
- BUT HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO FIND THAT STUFF?

236
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,000
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO ROBBED THE PLACE.

237
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:12,900
- WELL, AS MATTER OF FACT,

238
00:14:12,966 --> 00:14:16,000
WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA
WHO DID IT AND WHERE THEY ARE.

239
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:18,400
OUR JOB IS TO TAKE BACK WHATEVER
THEY STOLE FROM US.

240
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,300
- WHY US?

241
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:23,866
MILLENNION'S GOT A BUNCH OF GUYS
BETTER SUITED FOR THIS JOB.

242
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:27,066
- HEY, LOOK. I DON'T UNDERSTAND
ANY MORE THAN YOU DO.

243
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,866
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.
WE JUST DO WHAT WE'RE TOLD.

244
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,533
- BRANDON.
- YEAH?

245
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,666
- THIS COULD UGLY. YOU READY?

246
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:39,900
- YEAH.

247
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:47,300
- ( men laughing )

248
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:49,433
- WE DID IT! WE HIT THE JACKPOT.

249
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,900
JUST LOOK AT IT, WILL YOU?

250
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:53,566
WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH DOUGH TO
GO ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

251
00:14:53,633 --> 00:14:56,033
- WE'LL LEAVE IN THE MORNING
AND SELL IT LATER.

252
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,800
IN A DIFFERENT TOWN.
IT WILL BE SAFER THAT WAY.

253
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:01,033
- WE'LL BE FILTHY RICH
AND LIVE LIKE KINGS.

254
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,000
- ( footsteps approaching )

255
00:15:22,366 --> 00:15:24,566
- WHAT THE HELL! AN OLD MAN.

256
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,966
- WANDERING ALONE
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS

257
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:29,066
CAN BE REAL BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH.

258
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,433
YOU BASTARD!

259
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,966
- WHAT DO YOU GUYS WANT FROM US?
- WE'RE FROM MILLENNION.

260
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:46,466
- MILLENNION? YOU MEAN...
- OH NO...

261
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:49,666
- I FOUND A COUPLE OF
THE ITEMS IN THEIR CAR, BOSS.

262
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:54,200
- I SEE. SO THAT AND THE STUFF
ON THE TABLE IS ALL OF IT, THEN?

263
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:57,833
- I...
- EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

264
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:00,200
- YEAH.

265
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:02,566
- YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE
TOUCHED THE THINGS YOU STOLE.

266
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:03,866
WANNA KNOW WHY?

267
00:16:03,933 --> 00:16:05,933
BECAUSE THOSE
ITEMS BELONG TO US.

268
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,800
PROPERTY OF THE
MILLENNION ORGANIZATION.

269
00:16:10,866 --> 00:16:13,233
THE ORGANIZATION
HAS TO SAVE FACE.

270
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,366
HOW EMBARRASSING FOR US
THAT WE ALLOWED PUNKS

271
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,833
LIKE YOU TO STEAL OUR JEWELRY.

272
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,633
WE SHOULD NOTIFY THE POLICE
BUT THEN EVERYONE WOULD KNOW.

273
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,533
WE COULDN'T SAVE FACE
BY DOING THAT NOW, COULD WE?

274
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,100
- WE'LL RETURN IT.
EVERYTHING WE STOLE.

275
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,366
- NATURALLY, THAT
GOES WITHOUT SAYING.

276
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:31,300
BUT WHAT YOU'VE GOT
TO UNDERSTAND...

277
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:34,866
IS FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW,
THIS ROBBERY NEVER TOOK PLACE.

278
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:37,066
THE ITEMS REMAINED
IN THE WAREHOUSE.

279
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:39,500
WHICH MEANS THAT YOU
TWO NEVER STOLE THEM.

280
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,266
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU TWO DON'T EXIST.

281
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,166
NOT IN THIS WORLD ANYWAY.

282
00:16:46,233 --> 00:16:47,200
- ( both gasp )

283
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,433
- I'M SORRY.

284
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,833
BUT THE ORGANIZATION HAS IT'S
REPUTATION TO CONSIDER.

285
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:07,166
- ( gunshots )

286
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,066
- Widge: IT'S BEEN A LONG NIGHT.

287
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:19,633
SORRY I HAD TO ASK YOU TO COME
ALL THIS WAY TO BRING ME HOME.

288
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,333
- Gary: FORGET IT, BOSS.
NO PROBLEM.

289
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:29,866
- LISTEN, BRANDON.
THIS IS MILLENNION.

290
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,933
- YEAH.

291
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:45,200
- SEE YOU. GOOD NIGHT.

292
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,900
- WELCOME HOME, SON.

293
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:53,600
- MOTHER. YOU'RE STILL
UP AT THIS HOUR?

294
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,800
- I KNOW, BUT IT WAS
GETTING SO LATE

295
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,200
AND YOU STILL
HADN'T COME HOME...

296
00:17:58,266 --> 00:18:00,266
I WAS TOO WORRIED TO SLEEP.

297
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:04,033
- I'M SORRY MOTHER.
I HAD TO WORK LATE.

298
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,733
NOW LETS GET
YOU INSIDE, ALL RIGHT?

299
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,433
IT'S CHILLY OUT HERE.
IT ISN'T GOOD FOR YOU.

300
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:13,333
- YOU LOOK TIRED.
YOU SHOULDN'T WORK SO HARD.

301
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,966
- I'M FINE. BESIDES, THE
REASON I'M SO BUSY IS BECAUSE

302
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:19,066
THE COMPANY IS MAKING
A LOT OF MONEY, RIGHT NOW.

303
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:20,733
- WELL, I SUPPOSE SO.

304
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,933
BUT STILL...

305
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,700
- LET'S GO TO BED. DON'T
FORGET TO TAKE YOUR MEDICINE.

306
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,433
- HEY.

307
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:31,233
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

308
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,266
MR. WIDGE HAS TO LIVE
WITH THAT SICKLY OLD LADY.

309
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,966
I MEAN YOU HEARD HER, RIGHT?

310
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:37,500
SHE DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE.

311
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:39,866
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THAT
HER SON IS IN THE MAFIA.

312
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:42,633
SHE THINKS HE WORKS
AT SOME 9 TO 5 JOB SOMEWHERE.

313
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,033
BUT I ADMIRE HIM FOR
NOT TELLING HER.

314
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,066
TO KEEP HER FROM
WORRYING ABOUT HIM.

315
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:51,633
THAT'S THE WAY HE IS.

316
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,500
I MEAN HE COULD'VE TOLD US
TO KILL THOSE GUYS TONIGHT.

317
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:57,100
BUT HE FELT IT WAS
HIS RESPONSIBILITY.

318
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:00,900
THAT'S WHY I LIKE THE BOSS.
HE'S A STAND-UP GUY.

319
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,566
- HEY, IT'S ME! HOW YOU DOING?
- HARRY, WHY ARE YOU HERE?

320
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:24,366
- THERE'S SOMETHING I WANTED
TO TELL YOU, THAT'S ALL.

321
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:26,733
BY THE WAY, THIS IS
TOO CARELESS OF YOU.

322
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,866
ILLEGAL BETTING
AND LOAN SHARKING.

323
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:38,866
A NICKLE AND DIME OPERATION
THAT WON'T GET YOU ANYWHERE.

324
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:41,566
YOU CAN'T GET AHEAD IN A
DEAD-END JOB LIKE THIS.

325
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:44,466
YOU NEED A HIGH PROFILE JOB
THAT'LL GET THEIR RESPECT.

326
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,200
LIKE THE ONE YOU HANDLED
EARLIER TONIGHT.

327
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,933
YOU SEE, I ASKED
THE GUYS AT THE TOP

328
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,900
TO GIVE YOU GUYS THE ASSIGNMENT.

329
00:19:54,966 --> 00:19:57,700
NOW THAT YOU'VE DONE IT
AND PROVEN YOURSELF

330
00:19:57,766 --> 00:20:01,100
I CAN RECOMMEND YOU TO MY BOSS.

331
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,033
YOU THINK WHAT I DID WAS WRONG?

332
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:12,466
- NO...

333
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,566
- GUESS I SHOULD'VE MINDED
MY OWN BUSINESS.

334
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,733
SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO
CAUSE YOU ANY TROUBLE.

335
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:22,633
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

336
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:26,866
- BRANDON, YOU KNEW
MARIA WAS INVOLVED

337
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:28,933
IN THE ORGANIZATION, DIDN'T YOU?

338
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:32,066
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE,
ISN'T IT?

339
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,866
- NOW HOW DID YOU...

340
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:38,100
- YEAH, I THOUGHT SO. YOU IDIOT.

341
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:43,033
HERE. THIS IS THE ADDRESS
OF THE SCHOOL MARIA GOES TO.

342
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,433
I'VE HAD IT A WHILE BUT I
WASN'T GONNA GIVE IT TO YOU.

343
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,000
WANNA KNOW WHY?
HERE'S THE REASON.

344
00:20:53,066 --> 00:20:56,800
MARIA'S AT THE MANSION.
SHE LIVES THERE WITH BIG DADDY.

345
00:20:56,866 --> 00:20:59,966
THE BIG BOSS HIMSELF. THE
ORGANIZATION'S HEAD HONCHO.

346
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:05,133
I DON'T WHY OR WHAT THE
CIRCUMSTANCES WERE...

347
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,266
BUT FOR SOME REASON, BIG DADDY
INVITED HER INTO THE FAMILY.

348
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,333
THE ORGANIZATION'S
ELITE INNER CIRCLE.

349
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,200
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT MEANS?

350
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:18,266
IT MEANS THAT
SHE'S UNAPPROACHABLE.

351
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:33,166
PLEASE, BRANDON. TRY NOT
TO DO ANYTHING TOO STUPID.

352
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:36,466
'CAUSE IF YOU DO,
YOU WON'T SURVIVE.

353
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:50,433
- Brandon: I WANT TO SEE HER.

354
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,833
I WANT TO SEE MARIA.

355
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,766
THAT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT KEEPS ME GOING.

356
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,400
THE ONLY THING I HAVE
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

357
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,266
I WAS TOO ASHAMED TO
LOOK HER IN THE FACE

358
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,600
WHEN I'D HAD THE CHANCE...

359
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:12,033
AND NOW SHE IS WAY
OUT OF MY REACH.

360
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:15,633
BUT, I LONG FOR
THE SIGHT OF HER.

361
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,200
JUST ONE LOOK.

362
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:21,900
MARIA...

363
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,166
- BRANDON!

364
00:22:33,966 --> 00:22:35,200
- MARIA...

365
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:47,100
- ( pop song playing )

366
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,600
- ( man singing )

367
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,200
- Brandon: HARRY BELONGED
TO MILLENNION.

368
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,500
MARIA BELONGED TO MILLENNION.

369
00:24:19,566 --> 00:24:22,566
EVERYONE IMPORTANT TO ME
WAS A PART OF MILLENNION.

370
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:26,166
SO I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO FIGHT.
TO PROTECT WHAT WAS IMPORTANT.

371
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:28,433
TO PROTECT
THE ONES I LOVED.
