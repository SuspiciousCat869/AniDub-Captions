1
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:13,200
( theme music playing )

2
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,400
- ( inaudible )

3
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,533
- Maria: I DIDN'T KNOW IF I'D
EVER GET TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

4
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,000
AND NOW YOU ARE HERE,
I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT.

5
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:56,133
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.
OH, BRANDON I'M SO HAPPY.

6
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,500
- ALL I CAN SAY IS THANK GOD.
- Brandon: HMM.

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,866
I TRIED TO GET IN
TOUCH WITH YOU.

8
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:04,866
BUT I HAD NO IDEA
WHERE YOU WERE.

9
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:06,233
HOW TO FIND YOU.

10
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,466
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU WAS
THAT DAY AT THE CEMETERY.

11
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:11,400
I COULD SEE YOU WERE IN DANGER.

12
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:14,066
BUT THEY SAID WE HAD
TO LEAVE RIGHT AWAY.

13
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:15,233
I HAD NO CHOICE.

14
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:19,266
BUT STILL, I'M, I'M SORRY.

15
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,566
- Brandon: THANK YOU.
- Maria: HUH?

16
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:24,033
THANK YOU, MARIA.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

17
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,900
FOR THE FIRST TIME
SINCE I JOINED MILLENNION,

18
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:35,300
I FELT A SENSE OF CONTENTMENT
AND HOPE. I'D FOUND MARIA.

19
00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:37,900
AND THE FACT THAT SHE
WAS HERE, IN THE SAME TOWN,

20
00:02:37,966 --> 00:02:39,700
AND THAT HARRY WAS TOO...

21
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:42,300
MADE ME FEEL BETTER
ABOUT MY LIFE HERE.

22
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:45,366
THOSE WERE THE IMPORTANT THINGS.
THE ONLY THINGS THAT MATTERED.

23
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:48,233
IT WASN'T MUCH.
BUT IT WAS ALL I NEEDED.

24
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,266
OF COURSE AT THE TIME I HAD NO
IDEA HOW DIFFICULT IT COULD BE

25
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:54,566
FOR A PERSON TO PROTECT WHAT
WAS MOST IMPORTANT TO HIM.

26
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:58,766
THAT WOULD COME LATER.
BUT AT THAT TIME, I WAS CONTENT.

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,400
SORRY I'M LATE.

28
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,000
- VERY LATE. WHO GAVE
YOU THE MORNING OFF?

29
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:23,500
YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS?

30
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:26,800
- YEAH SORRY.
- A GIRL RIGHT?

31
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:29,833
- WELL I...
- YOU CAN'T SAY NO, CAN YOU?

32
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,433
- YEAH! I KNEW IT ALL ALONG.

33
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,200
WELL WHAT DO YOU
KNOW ABOUT THAT?

34
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:35,866
A GUY WHO HARDLY
EVER SAYS A WORD,

35
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:38,166
AND HAS A SOCIAL LIFE
OF A TIBETIAN MONK,

36
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:40,400
GOT HIMSELF A DATE.

37
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:43,566
DATING IS FINE SEE, BUT IF YOU
GET HITCHED BEFORE I DO...

38
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,800
- I'LL KILL YA...
- KILL ME, WHY?

39
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:50,266
- UGH! YOU JUST DON'T
GET IT, DO YOU?

40
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,900
JUST GET ME A WOMAN. ANY WOMAN,
JUST GET ME ONE , WILL YA...

41
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,200
- LIGHTEN UP GARY.
GIVE HIM A BREAK.

42
00:03:58,266 --> 00:04:01,100
- CUSTOMER NUMBER 153
DIDN'T PAY ON TIME.

43
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,300
GO ROUGH HIM UP A LITTLE.

44
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:05,200
- AYE-AYE, SIR, I'M ON MY WAY.

45
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,833
YO, BRANDON.

46
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,200
YOU CAN FILL ME IN ALL THE
DETAILS LATER. ALL RIGHT?

47
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:16,933
- LISTEN BRANDON, DON'T EVER
GO NEAR THAT GIRL SCHOOL AGAIN.

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,266
YOU UNDERSTAND?

49
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,233
I DON'T KNOW WHO
WROTE THE ORDER.

50
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,766
BUT THIS IS AN UPPER
LEVEL DIRECTIVE.

51
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,233
SO, MUST HAVE COME
STRAIGHT FROM THE TOP.

52
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,900
WHAT ARE YOU DOING BRANDON?
WHO IS THIS GIRL?

53
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:31,833
IF YOU DON'T WANNA TALK,
THAT'S FINE.

54
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,400
BUT LISTEN UP! IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT YOU NEVER FORGET.

55
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:37,866
NO MATTER HOW LOW YOU
ARE ON THE FOOD CHAIN,

56
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:40,266
YOU'RE STILL A PART OF
THIS ORGANIZATION.

57
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,333
WHOSE MEMBERS KNOW,

58
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,800
THAT ORDERS FROM THE
UPPER LEVEL ARE ABSOLUTE.

59
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,033
AND TO BE FOLLOWED
WITHOUT QUESTION.

60
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,466
THATS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE
PART OF MILLENNION...

61
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:50,400
OTHERWISE PUNKS LIKE US
WOULD STILL BE FIGHTING

62
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:51,800
AND DYING IN THE STREETS.

63
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:52,933
UNDERSTAND?

64
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,333
- YES.

65
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,966
- WELL THEN, AS LONG AS
WE ARE ON THE SUBJECT.

66
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:01,166
I'M GOING TO
TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY,

67
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:03,033
TO TELL YOU WHY
OUR BOSS, BIG DADDY,

68
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,666
ESTABLISHED THE
MILLENNION ORGANIZATION.

69
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:07,800
AND WHAT HE TRULY
INTENDED IT TO BE.

70
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:15,933
- Harry: I SEE.
SO, YOU SAW MARIA.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,900
I FIGURED YOU
WOULD SOONER OR LATER.

72
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:23,000
AND WITHIN 24 HOURS UPPER LEVEL
SENT YOU A WARNING. RIGHT?

73
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:26,500
- YA, BUT WHY?
- THINK ABOUT IT.

74
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:28,800
LOOK, SINCE SHE LIVES IN
BIG DADDY'S MANSION...

75
00:05:28,866 --> 00:05:30,900
THERE ARE THOSE WHO MIGHT
TRY TO USE HER TO GAIN ACCESS

76
00:05:30,966 --> 00:05:32,766
TO THE ORGANIZATION'S
TOP PEOPLE.

77
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,733
AND THINK ABOUT WHAT
WOULD HAPPEN,

78
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,400
IF AN OPPOSING ORGANIZATION THAT
WANTED TO TARGET BIG DADDY,

79
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:39,166
FOUND OUT SHE WAS LIVING THERE?

80
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:42,133
THEY'D BOTH BE IN DANGER.
THE FEWER PEOPLE SHE KNOWS,

81
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,066
THE LESS RISK THERE
IS OF THAT HAPPENING.

82
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:47,300
THATS WHY YOU GOT THE WARNING.
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,666
LOOK, I KNEW THAT
THIS WOULD HAPPEN

84
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,866
IF I TOLD YOU WHERE SHE WAS.

85
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:56,600
BUT I WANTED TO ANYWAY.
EVEN IF IT GOT ME IN TROUBLE.

86
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:57,966
IF YOU'D BEEN IN MY SHOES

87
00:05:58,033 --> 00:05:59,733
YOU WOULD HAVE
DONE THE SAME FOR ME.

88
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:03,633
- SORRY IF I GOT
YOU IN TROUBLE, HARRY.

89
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,233
- HUH! FORGET IT.

90
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,333
- Man: ARE YOU BRANDON HEAT?

91
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,200
- Brandon: YA.
- Harry: HMM.

92
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,233
- ( footsteps approaching )

93
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,500
- ( knocking on door )

94
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:11,933
- Man: WE BROUGHT HIM, SIR.
- Big Daddy: AH! SEND HIM IN.

95
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,333
GIVE ME A MINUTE, WILL YOU?
THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.

96
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,233
VERY NICE.

97
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:47,966
TELL ME. DO YOU LIKE TO FISH?
HUH? TO FISH. YOU KNOW FISHING?

98
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:50,200
- I DON'T KNOW SIR.
I'VE NEVER DONE IT.

99
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,800
- WELL, THEN FOLLOW ME.

100
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,966
YES THATS RIGHT.

101
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:06,833
YOU MAKE THE FLY MOVE THROUGH
THE WATER AS IF IT'S ALIVE.

102
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,466
THAT'S WHAT ATTRACTS THE FISH.

103
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:13,933
HMM, GOOD VERY GOOD.
YOU HAVE A REAL KNACK FOR IT.

104
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,333
THIS FRIEND I ONCE HAD. IN FACT
I CONSIDERED HIM MY BEST FRIEND.

105
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,766
IT MUST BE WHAT
15 YEARS AGO NOW.

106
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,133
MY FRIEND MADE A TERRIBLE
MISTAKE. HE COMMITTED A CRIME.

107
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,066
IN ORDER TO MAKE RESTITUTION
HE BECAME THE GUARDIAN

108
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:44,666
OF A YOUNG CHILD. A LITTLE GIRL.

109
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,000
HE WAS DETERMINED TO MAKE
HER NEEDS MORE IMPORTANT

110
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:48,900
THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN HIS LIFE.

111
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:51,433
AND TO RAISE HER IN THE
LIGHT OF THE REAL WORLD.

112
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,166
NOT IN THE SHADOWS, OF THE
DARK WORLD HE LEFT BEHIND.

113
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,733
BUT WHEN HE DIED, HIS WISH
HAD YET TO BE FULFILLED.

114
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,100
SO I DECIDED TO MAKE
HIS WISH MY OWN

115
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,600
AND TAKE CARE OF
THE GIRL IN HIS PLACE.

116
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,300
- YOU MEAN MARIA...

117
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,900
- WELL, DO YOU RESENT ME
FOR WHAT I'VE DONE?

118
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:14,933
- NO SIR.

119
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,633
- I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT.
THANK YOU, BRANDON HEAT.

120
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,600
- Brandon: I REALLY...
I SHOULD...

121
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,933
- IF YOU WANT TO SEE HER,
IT'S FINE WITH ME.

122
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,800
AS LONG AS YOU VISIT HER
HERE AT THE MANSION.

123
00:09:29,866 --> 00:09:33,366
BUT BRANDON, PLEASE DON'T
TRY TO SEE HER ANYWHERE ELSE.

124
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:34,900
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?

125
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:38,433
- I UNDERSTAND SIR.

126
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
- MY ORGANIZATION
AND MY FAMILY

127
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:42,466
WILL USE ALL THEIR
POWER TO PROTECT HER.

128
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:44,333
BY WHATEVER MEANS NECESSARY.

129
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,366
HMM? YOUR LINES TIPPING
I THINK YOU'VE HOOKED ONE.

130
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,833
WHOA! TAKE IT EASY.

131
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,700
IF YOU PULL TOO HARD, THE LINE
WILL BREAK AND YOU'LL LOSE HIM.

132
00:09:55,766 --> 00:09:58,500
ANTICIPATE HIS MOVES AND
REEL HIM IN SLOWLY.

133
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:03,166
YES, GOOD JOB. THAT'S THE WAY!
VERY WELL DONE!

134
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,866
- Widge: WHEN BIG DADDY
FIRST IMMIGRATED HERE.

135
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:10,533
THIS WAS JUST A SMALL TOWN.

136
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,366
SURROUNDED BY NOTHING
BUT ROCKS AND DESSERT.

137
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:16,933
BACK IN THOSE DAYS, THINGS
WERE A LOT MORE CHAOTIC

138
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,300
THAN THEY ARE NOW.

139
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:21,366
THERE WAS FIGHTING IN
THE STREETS ON A DAILY BASIS.

140
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:25,333
RIGHT AND WRONG DIDN'T MATTER.
ALL THAT MATTERED WAS SURVIVAL.

141
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,466
HE FOUGHT FOR HIS LIFE.

142
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:29,266
AS WELL AS THE LIVES OF HIS
FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS.

143
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,100
BIG DADDY TOOK IT UPON
HIMSELF TO PROTECT THEM.

144
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,833
AS THE TOWN GOT BIGGER THE
NUMBER OF PEOPLE BIG DADDY

145
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,866
HAD TO PROTECT GREW TOO.

146
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:38,700
AND SOON THERE WERE
HUNDREDS OF THEM.

147
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:41,933
TO HIM, EVERYONE OF THEM WAS
A MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY.

148
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,066
IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEM, BIG
DADDY FOUNDED AN ORGANIZATION...

149
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:48,133
WHICH HE CALLED, MILLENNION.

150
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:50,233
TO PROTECT.

151
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:54,866
YES, IN ORDER TO
PROTECT HIS FAMILY.

152
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,933
- Gary: WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

153
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,200
YA THINK, THIS IS GONNA MAKE FOR
SHOWING UP 2 DAYS LATE IN A ROW?

154
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:05,600

157
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,000
- I'M SORRY.

158
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:13,700
- ( LAUGHS ) THAT'S ALRIGHT,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

159
00:11:13,766 --> 00:11:15,866
I'LL ASK MY MOTHER TO DO IT.

160
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:17,100
HEY! I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

161
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,700
WHY DON'T YOU TWO COME OVER TO
MY HOUSE FOR DINNER TONIGHT?

162

SURPRISES BRANDON.

166
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,300
I HAD NO IDEA YOU LIKED TO FISH.

167
00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:33,466
- Gary: FISH TALK EVEN
LESS THAN HE DOES.

168
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:36,300
MAYBE THATS WHY THEY
GET ALONG SO WELL.

169
00:11:36,366 --> 00:11:38,266
- YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT...

170
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,300

171
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:50,466

174
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,933
- THE MANSION'S REALLY
HUGE , ISN'T IT?

175
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,300
I HAD A HARD TIME
GETTING USED TO IT AT FIRST.

176
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,700
BRANDON, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING THESE DAYS?

177
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,366
NOTHING DANGEROUS I HOPE?

178
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,233
- I'M WORKING FOR
A COURIER SERVICE.

179
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,066

THE ONLY ONE WHO GETS TO LIVE

182
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:28,633
IN SUCH A GORGEOUS PLACE.

183
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,566
I FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT.

184
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:31,633
BUT THAT'S ALRIGHT.

185
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,266
AFTER ALL I'M NOT GOING
TO LIVE HERE FOREVER.

186
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,100
ONCE I GRADUATE, EVERYTHING
IS GOING TO CHANGE.

187
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:40,633
FIRST, I'LL FIND A JOB. THEN I
CAN START LIVING ON MY OWN.

188
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,033
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE...

189

DID I HEAR RIGHT?

192
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,300
YOU ARE PLANNING ON MOVING
OUT OF THE MANSION?

193
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:52,233

- Man: WHY, RANDY?

224
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:03,733
- ITS COME TO
OUR ATTENTION,

225
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,466
THAT A MAFIA GROUP
CALLED LIGHTNING

226
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:07,966
HAS BEEN UNUSUALLY BUSY
THE PAST FEW DAYS.

227
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,400
ACCORDING TO AN INFORMANT THEY
MIGHT TRY TO PULL SOME SORT OF

228
00:15:10,466 --> 00:15:12,333
STUNT DURING
TONIGHTS FESTIVITIES.

229
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,200
- BUT THIS EVENT IS BIG
DADDY'S OPPORTUNITY

230
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:15,833
TO REINFORCE HIS RELATIONSHIPS,

231
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,066
WITH OUR MOST IMPORTANT
BUSINESS ASSOCIATES.

232
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:20,633
IT'S FAR TOO LATE TO
CANCEL IT NOW.

233
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,966
- AND IF IT TURNS INTO A
WORST-CASE SCENARIO,

234
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:23,966
WHAT THEN?

235
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:26,233
- Bear: THE PARTY WILL
TAKE PLACE AS PLANNED.

236
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,833
COLLECT EVERY BIT OF INFORMATION
YOU CAN MANAGE TO SCRAPE UP

237
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,433
ON THESE LIGHTNING GUYS.

238
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,233
LEAVE THE REST TO ME AND MY MEN.
WE WILL TAKE CARE OF IT.

241
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:43,533
- HARRY'S GONNA LOVE THIS.

242
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,200
- ( humming )

243
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:48,733
- GOT SOME GOOD NEWS
FOR YOU HARRY. BOB'S DONE IT.

244
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,733
- HUH?

245
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,266
- HERE TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

246
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:53,033
- HUH?

247
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:56,533
THIS IS A CHANCE
WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

248
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,933
START GATHERING INFORMATION
ABOUT THIS LIGHTNING GROUP.

249
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,166
NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT COSTS.

250
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:04,566
- ALRIGHT HARRY BUT ONLY IF I
GET TO COME ALONG FOR THE RIDE.

251
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:05,966
- WELL NATURALLY.

252
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:33,000
- BRANDON!

253
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,300
WOW! THAT TUX LOOKS
REALLY GREAT ON YOU.

254
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:40,433
BUT THE HAIR?

255
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,766
I WAS JUST JOKING. NOW, COME
AND DANCE WITH ME.

256
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,800
- I...
I DON'T KNOW HOW.

257
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:52,800
- ALRIGHT THEN I'M
GOING TO TEACH YOU.

258
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:04,433
- ON BEHALF OF MY COMPANY, I
WANNA TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY

259
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,033
TO REAFFIRM OUR
COMMITMENT TO BUILDING A CLOSER

260
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,533
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
MILLENNION ORGANIZATION,

261
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,300
AND ITS AFFILIATES.

262
00:17:11,366 --> 00:17:14,366
- THAT'S GREAT BRANDON.

263
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,733
- Man 1: THE ONLY ONE WE ARE
AFTER IS MILLENNION'S BOSS.

264
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,666
THE OTHERS ARE OF NO IMPORTANCE.

265
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:22,533
- Man 2: UNDERSTOOD. ANYTHING
ELSE WE SHOULD KNOW?

266
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,533
- EVERYTHING IS GOING JUST FINE.

267
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,900
ONE OF OUR GUYS
IS ALREADY INSIDE.

268
00:17:27,966 --> 00:17:29,266
- Man 2: IT'S TIME.

269
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,433
- HEY YOU! GET OUT
OF THE WAY. MOVE IT.

270
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,900
- OH, I'M SORRY.

271
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:40,033
LOOKS LIKE NO ONE CAN
USE THIS ROAD RIGHT NOW.

272
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,933
AND THAT INCLUDES
YOU LIGHTENING GUYS.

GOT THE CHANCE TO THANK YOU.

281
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:59,400
IT WAS A GREAT LEARNING
EXPERIENCE. YOU TAUGHT ME A LOT.

HARRY MACDOWEL OF MILLENNION,
AT YOUR SERVICE.

283
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,266

- JUST DO IT...

310
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,800
- IN THAT CASE BE CAREFUL
BIG DADDY. REAL CAREFUL.

311
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,533
- Maria: BRANDON, WHAT'S
TAKING HIM SO LONG?

312
00:22:00,633 --> 00:22:03,866
- WHY BRANDON? WHY
DID YOU SAVE ME?

313
00:22:05,566 --> 00:22:07,700
FOR MILLENNION'S SAKE OR...

314
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,333
FOR MARIA'S...

315
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:12,500
- ( gasping )

316
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,966
- BRANDON!

317
00:22:16,366 --> 00:22:20,266
- Brandon: WHY? WHY DID I
DO IT? WHY DID I PROTECT HIM?

318
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,800
WHY DID I FIRE A GUN?
WHY DID I KILL?

319
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,633
AS I BEGAN TO LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS

320
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:34,200
I SAW MARIA'S FACE.
AND HARRY'S TOO.

321
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:37,933
AND I KEPT THINKING ABOUT
WHAT IT REALLY MEANS

322
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,200
TO PROTECT SOMEONE.

323
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:46,366
- ( pop song playing )

324
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,933
- ( man singing )

325
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:18,733
- Brandon: THE MAN PULLS THE
TRIGGER IN SILENCE.

326
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,333
A BRIGHT DEADLY FLASH TAKES
ANOTHER SOUL.

327
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,500
BRANDON HEAT OF MILLENNION,

328
00:24:24,566 --> 00:24:28,066
THE MAN THEY CALL "THE SWEEPER."
