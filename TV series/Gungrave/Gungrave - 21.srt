1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,933
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:51,300
- SO KUGASHIRO ORDERED
ALL OF OUR MEN

3
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:53,566
IN SECTION "C" TO PULL OUT?

4
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:54,700
- YES, SIR.

5
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:57,866
HE ALSO TOOK AN E-BRID
COUNTER-NECROLIZER FROM THE LAB.

6
00:01:57,933 --> 00:02:00,966
WE BELIEVE HE INTENDS 
TO CONTACT OUR TARGET.

7
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,533
- I THINK THAT I MIGHT
UNDERSTAND WHY HE DID IT.

8
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,233
KUGASHIRO WANTS TO SETTLE
THIS THING MAN-TO-MAN.

9
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,133
WHERE'S KUGASHIRO NOW?

10
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,566
- WE LOST TRACK OF HIM, SIR.

11
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,600
- HMM?

12
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,033
I SEE.

13
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,866
KUGASHIRO'S ONE OF 
THE BEST WE'VE GOT,

14
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:20,533
AND HE NEVER GIVES UP.

15
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,700
MAYBE, HE JUST MIGHT.

16
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,700
- JUST MIGHT WHAT, SIR?

17
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:28,400
- HEH.  I WORRY TOO MUCH.

18
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:30,566
- BEAR WALKEN.
- HMM?

19
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:33,066
- IS THE TARGET 
REALLY GONNA TRY

20
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:35,300
TO DESTROY MILLENNION
BY HIMSELF?

21
00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:36,966
- DESTROY MILLENNION?

22
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,966
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT I DOUBT IT.

23
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,333
I THINK IT'S JUST 
THE BOSS HE WANTS.

24
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,000
IN FACT,
IF THAT GUY IS BRANDON HEAT,

25
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:46,233
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

26
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,300
- ( sighs )

27
00:02:55,366 --> 00:02:58,633
WE'VE GOT DOZENS OF ORGMEN
OUT THERE SEARCHING FOR HIM NOW.

28
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,666
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT YOU 
STILL HAVEN'T FOUND THE TARGET?

29
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:04,000
- WE'RE TRYING HARD, SIR.
WE'RE SEARCHING ROUND THE CLOCK.

30
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:05,900
- SEARCHING?
ALWAYS SEARCHING.

31
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:08,766
I'M SICK AND TIRED
OF HEARING THAT WORD.

32
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,266
- ( gasps )

33
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,100
- CALM DOWN, WILL YOU?

34
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,233
- YES, SIR.

35
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,100
- HMM...

36
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,066
- ( shakily )
EXCUSE ME.

37
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,800
- ( door opens, closes )

38
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:36,300
- I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH
I'D REGRET LOSING BOB POUNDMAX.

39
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:38,300
WE REALLY COULD HAVE
USED HIS HELP.

40
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:39,366
NOW THAT HE'S GONE,

41
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:42,133
HIS PERSONAL INTELLIGENCE
NETWORK IS INACCESSIBLE.

42
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,966
- HE WAS ALWAYS VERY CAREFUL
IN REGARD TO SECURITY.

43
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:47,900
HE NEVER GAVE HIS CONTACTS
TO ANYONE, NOT EVEN ME.

44
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:50,900
- NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. 
HE WAS THE VERY BEST.

45
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:53,533
- THAT'S TRUE.
AND HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

46
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:57,166
- I KNOW.

47
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:59,600
BELIEVE ME,
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

48
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:03,000
WE WILL FIND HIM.
MILLENNION OWNS THIS CITY.

49
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:04,833
HE'S OUR ENEMY,
AND EVERYONE KNOWS IT,

50
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,000
SO THEY WON'T DARE
TRY TO HELP HIM.

51
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:09,000
OH, WE'LL FIND HIM, ALL RIGHT.

52
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:10,633
THEN HE'S ALL YOURS.

53
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,966
TEACH HIM THE WAY
I DO BUSINESS--

54
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:16,566
THE MILLENNION WAY
OF DOING BUSINESS.

55
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,933
- ALL RIGHT.

56
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:53,633
- I HAVE A FEW ERRANDS TO RUN.

57
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,800
GOOD-BYE.
I'LL RETURN TOMORROW MORNING.

58
00:04:55,866 --> 00:04:57,066
MEET ME HERE.

59
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,633
AND PLEASE, BE CAREFUL.

60
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,300
- Announcer on TV: TODAY'S THIRD
RACE IS FULL OF SURPRISES.

61
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:06,133
SNAIL-GUNNER, THE 12-TO-ONE...

62
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,633
- SAME OLD, SAME OLD.
HOW BORING.

63
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,133
THIS IS NO FUN ANYMORE,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

64
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,233
WHEN DID EVERYTHING START GOING
DOWN THE DRAIN? WHAT WENT WRONG?

65
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,566
YOU GOT ME.

66
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,133
- ( doorbell ringing )
- HUH?

67
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,300
WHO THE HELL
COULD THAT BE?

68
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:24,133
AND AT THIS HOUR?

69
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,366
- ( doorbell continues ringing )
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

70
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:28,166
KEEP YOUR PANTS ON.

71
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:31,233
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

72
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:36,966
NICE WOUND YOU GOT.

73
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:38,800
YOU'RE ON THE WRONG SIDE
OF TOWN, AREN'T YOU?

74
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:41,800
LOOK, I GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE ORGANIZATION ANYMORE.

75
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:44,300
YOU GOT NO BUSINESS HERE.
GET LOST.

76
00:05:44,366 --> 00:05:46,333
FOLKS FROM THE OTHER SIDE
AREN'T WELCOME HERE.

77
00:05:48,366 --> 00:05:49,966
TAKE YOUR HAND OFF THE DOOR.

78
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:51,700
- I AM BRANDON.

79
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:52,700
- HUH?

80
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:55,433
- BRANDON HEAT.

81
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,433
- UH, DID YOU SAY BRANDON?

82
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,266
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'RE BRANDON HEAT!

83
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,433
FELLA, YOU GOT
A LOUSY SENSE OF HUMOR.

84
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,266
THAT GUY'S DEAD!
- GARY?

85
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,233
I KNOW HIS VOICE.
IT'S TRUE, GARY, IT'S HIM.

86
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,233
- WHAT?!
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, BOSS?

87
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,733
HOW COULD HE BE?
BRANDON DIED YEARS AGO.

88
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,733
- MY HEARING'S GOTTEN A LOT
SHARPER SINCE I LOST MY SIGHT.

89
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,233
IT'S BRANDON, ALL RIGHT.
I'M SURE OF IT.

90
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,833
I'D KNOW HIS VOICE ANYWHERE.

91
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,066
- UH-- ( sighs )

92
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,733
FOR REAL YOU'RE BRANDON HEAT?

93
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:30,733
- EXCUSE ME? DO YOU THINK WE
COULD TALK ABOUT THIS INSIDE?

94
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,233
IT'S A LONG STORY.

95
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:39,033
- MAN, OH, MAN!
I'VE READ SOME STRANGE STORIES,

96
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,866
BUT NONE OF THEM
AS WEIRD AS THIS ONE.

97
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:43,700
I KNOW MILLENNION'S GOT A BUNCH
OF THOSE CREEPAZOID FREAKS.

98
00:06:43,766 --> 00:06:46,366
BUT NOW YOU TELL US
THAT BRANDON'S A MONSTER TOO?

99
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:47,666
AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF,

100
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:49,933
YOU TELL US THAT
YOU'RE BIG DADDY'S DAUGHTER?

101
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,766
- I'VE BEEN HEARING RUMORS
RECENTLY

102
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,100
ABOUT SOMETHING GOING ON
WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION,

103
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,933
SOMETHING THAT HAS TO DO
WITH YOU AND BRANDON, MISS.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,666
NOW I SEE WHY.

105
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:00,500
- BRANDON, TELL ME.

106
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:03,266
WHAT WAS IT THAT
MADE YOU BETRAY MILLENNION?

107
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,966
- GARY, WHY EVEN BOTHER TO ASK?

108
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:08,633
YOU'VE SEEN WHAT KIND OF
ORGANIZATION IT IS NOW. 

109
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,633
- YEAH.  USING MONSTERS
TO TAKE WHAT THEY WANT,

110
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,200
USING FEAR TO CONTROL
THE WHOLE CITY.

111
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:17,700
DAMN.  IT WAS NEVER THE SAME
AFTER THEY KILLED BIG DADDY.

112
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:18,700
- ( gasps )

113
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:19,966
- MY FATHER WAS--

114
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:21,100
- GARY!

115
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,366
- I'M SORRY.

116
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:24,500
I ASSUMED YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN
HOW HE DIED.

117
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:26,500
- MY FATHER...

118
00:07:26,566 --> 00:07:29,500
MY FATHER WAS MURDERED?

119
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:31,266
- IT'S A RUMOR.

120
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,733
JUST A RUMOR, THAT'S ALL.

121
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,200
- NO, IT'S NOT.

122
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:38,133
MY MOM, MY DAD,
MR. TOKIOKA... 

123
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,100
THEY KILLED EVERYONE.

124
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,066
( sobs )
OH, NO. 

125
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,633
NO!

126
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,600
( crying )

127
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,800
- THERE SEEMS TO BE
NO SURVEILLANCE.

128
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,966
- I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE ALIVE.

129
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:17,600
- I THINK IT WOULD
BE MORE ACCURATE

130
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,366
TO SAY THAT I FAILED TO DIE.

131
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,600
MILLENNION MUSTN'T FIND OUT.
LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

132
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,900
- HERE'S THE ORGMEN REFERENCE
MATERIAL YOU ASKED FOR,

133
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:28,233
AS WELL AS EVERYTHING
I COULD FIND

134
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,433
ON THE SUPERIORIZATION PROCESS.

135
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,866
- THANK YOU.

136
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:34,466
I'M SORRY TO HAVE MADE YOU
TREAD ON SUCH DANGEROUS GROUND.

137
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:35,633
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

138
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,466
IF THEY WEREN'T HOLDING
MY FAMILY HOSTAGE,

139
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:39,633
I'D BE OUT THERE WITH YOU,
FIGHTING THEM.

140
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,100
- ( exhales )

141
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,433
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
AND STAY SAFE.

142
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,233
HOLD ON A LITTLE WHILE LONGER

143
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,700
AND WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO
RESCUE YOUR FAMILY.

144
00:08:48,766 --> 00:08:50,133
- DOCTOR.

145
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,266
- HOWEVER, I'M AFRAID,
YOU MUSTN'T COUNT ON THAT.

146
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,433
- ( tires screeching )

147
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,033
- Both: HUH?

148
00:08:58,666 --> 00:08:59,600
- ( exhales )

149
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,933
- DOCTOR!

150
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,900
- ( gunfire )

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,266
- HOW LONG'S IT BEEN SINCE WE
HAD A DRINK TOGETHER LIKE THIS?

152
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,266
- AT LEAST 20 YEARS OR SO.

153
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,366
- WELL, THEN, IT'S ABOUT TIME.

154
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:27,133
IT'S A SHAME
YOU CAN'T TASTE IT.

155
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,266
MUST BE ROUGH LIVING IN
THE KIND OF BODY YOU GOT NOW.

156
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,933
- ( exhales )
- WE KNOW, BRANDON.

157
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,700
YOU WANT US TO PROTECT
THE YOUNG LADY,

158
00:09:36,766 --> 00:09:37,700
WHILE YOU'RE GONE.

159
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:39,366
- DON'T WORRY, BRANDON.

160
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:42,633
WE COMPLETELY CUT OUR TIES
WITH THE ORGANIZATION.

161
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,566
YOU SEE, THE TRUTH IS
THEY FIRED US.

162
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,366
BETTIN' ON THE PONIES
ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE.

163
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:49,700
THESE DAYS, EVERYTHING'S
HANDLED BY A COMPUTER.

164
00:09:49,766 --> 00:09:51,666
THEY DON'T NEED
OLD FARTS LIKE US ANYMORE.

165
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:52,966
WE'RE OBSOLETE.

166
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:55,966
- HEY, IT WAS TIME
FOR US TO LEAVE ANYWAY,

167
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:58,666
BECAUSE WE WERE LOYAL
TO THE ORGANIZATION

168
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:00,966
BIG DADDY CREATED, 
THE OLD MILLENNION.

169
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,666
BUT THAT'S LONG GONE NOW.

170
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:06,800
EVERYTHING WE HAVE--
THIS HOME, A COMFORTABLE LIFE--

171
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:08,900
WE OWE IT ALL TO YOU,
BRANDON,

172
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:12,066
BECAUSE OF THE GOOD WORD YOU
PUT IN FOR US WITH BIG DADDY.

173
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:13,700
WE BOTH GOT PROMOTED.

174
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:16,433
AND I COULD TAKE CARE OF MOM
UNTIL SHE DIED.

175
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,766
- WE NEVER HAD A CHANCE
TO RETURN THE FAVOR,

176
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,433
SO NOW WE'D LIKE TO
PAY YOU BACK FOR WHAT YOU DID.

177
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,900
- AND PAY BIG DADDY BACK
AS WELL.

178
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,933
- MR. FORMALITY,
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.

179
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,566
- AND STILL QUIET TOO.
- ( Gary laughs )

180
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:36,566
SO...

181
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:37,966
YOU LEAVIN' ALREADY?

182
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:40,300
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA SAY
GOOD-BYE TO THE YOUNG LADY, HUH?

183
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:43,833
YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD
AT THAT, ARE YOU?

184
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,833
THAT'S SO LIKE YOU, BRANDON.

185
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,833
BUT WE CONSIDER YOU
A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY.

186
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,766
YOU CAN ALWAYS DEPEND ON US.
- YEAH.

187
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,633
- Widge's voice: BRANDON,
MILLENNION'S ON THE WRONG TRACK,

188
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,466
HEADED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.

189
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:04,633
IT'S NO LONGER THE ORGANIZATION
BIG DADDY INTENDED IT TO BE.

190
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,933
- HARRY...

191
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
( groans )

192
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:09,866
- ( tires screeching )

193
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:11,833
- ( grunts, exhales )

194
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:25,300
- ( grunts )

195
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:26,766
- EXCUSE ME, SIR.

196
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,833
BUT YOU HAD SEVERAL DRINKS,
THEN SAID YOU COULDN'T PAY.

197
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,466
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH THAT?

198
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:36,200
LAST TIME.

199
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:38,200
GET LOST, ASSHOLE!

200
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:39,600
- ( grunts )

201
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,000
- HEY, LISTEN UP, PAL.

202
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:43,033
YOU OUGHTA THANK ME,
CONSIDERING THE MESS YOU'RE IN.

203
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,533
I'M LETTING YOU OFF EASY.

204
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,600
I COULD SEND FOR THE GUYS
FROM MILLENNION IF I WANTED TO.

205
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,433
- ( chuckles )

206
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,433
YEAH, RIGHT.

207
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,433
MILLENNION-- WHAT A JOKE.

208
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,600
( coughs, spits )

209
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:56,933
- ( groans )

210
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,600
WHO THE HELL DO YOU
THINK YOU ARE?!

211
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,200
- ( both grunting )

212
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:20,633
- ( gasps )

213
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:24,633
HEY!  THAT'S THE GUY!

214
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,800
CALL HEADQUARTERS.

215
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:27,433
HE'S A WANTED CRIMINAL.

216
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,133
- ( growling )

217
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,433
- WHAT THE--?

218
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,733
- ( shouts, grunts )

219
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:38,866
- ( gunshots )

220
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:42,100
- WHAT?  YOU MEAN THE TARGET?

221
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,166
- HUH?

222
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:45,100
- SO HE APPROACHED THE
POLICE VOLUNTARILY?

223
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,466
HE CAME TO US ON HIS OWN?

224
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:48,633
IN A CAR?

225
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,133
( chuckles )

226
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,633
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

227
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,233
IN THAT CASE, CONTACT LOCKE

228
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,566
AND TELL HIM TO SEND
AN ORGMEN SQUAD TO THAT LOCATION

229
00:13:57,633 --> 00:13:59,600
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

230
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,833
- ORGMEN?

231
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,366
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO TAKE
HIM OUT YOURSELF, ONE-ON-ONE.

232
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:06,366
- ONCE WE HAVE THE MAN IN
CUSTODY, I CAN DO THAT ANYTIME.

233
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:10,366
HOWEVER, DESTROYING BRANDON HEAT
ISN'T MY ONLY CONCERN.

234
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,500
HE'S GOT TO BE GETTING HELP
FROM COLLABORATORS

235
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:13,866
OTHER THAN TOKIOKA.

236
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:16,733
SO I NEED TO EXPOSE ALL OF THEM
AND DESTROY THEIR NETWORK,

237
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,866
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

238
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:21,900
MY FEELINGS ABOUT THE DEATH
OF BOB POUNDMAX...

239
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:25,400
ARE VERY INTENSE, 
BURNING WITHIN ME.

240
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:27,366
- HMM.

241
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,866
SHOW HIM THE POWER
OF MILLENNION.

242
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:31,333
- YES, SIR.

243
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,366
- NO, WAIT.  PLEASE.
WAIT, MISS!

244
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:35,800
YOU CAN'T GO OUTSIDE.

245
00:14:35,866 --> 00:14:37,966
YOU'RE A TARGET, MISS.
THEY'LL SPOT YOU FOR SURE.

246
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:39,200
- BUT I--

247
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:41,900
- I'M AFRAID GARY'S RIGHT,
YOUNG LADY.

248
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:45,100
I WONDER IF YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW BRANDON FEELS.

249
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,600
- HOW HE FEELS?

250
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,133
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

251
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,633
- QUITE HONESTLY...

252
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,233
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

253
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,600
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- WELL, IT'S JUST THAT...

254
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,400
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY HE'S PROTECTING ME.

255
00:14:57,466 --> 00:14:59,166
I KNOW THAT HE WAS
A FRIEND OF MY MOM'S

256
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:00,366
AND THAT HE KNEW MY DAD,

257
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,866
BUT IS THAT ENOUGH REASON
FOR HIM TO GO THIS FAR?

258
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:04,300
- HMM?

259
00:15:04,366 --> 00:15:07,800
- MY MOM AND DAD
WERE KILLED BY THE ORGANIZATION,

260
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,966
KILLED BY HARRY MACDOWEL.

261
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:12,966
THAT'S WHY I HATE
BLOODY HARRY SO MUCH

262
00:15:13,033 --> 00:15:14,633
AND THE ORGANIZATION.

263
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,633
SO I KNOW WHY GRAVE
HATES HARRY MACDOWEL.

264
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,966
AFTER ALL, BLOODY HARRY
KILLED HIM TOO.

265
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:22,600
BUT NONE OF THAT WOULD GIVE HIM
A REASON TO PROTECT ME.

266
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,800
- YOU'RE WRONG.
HE'S GOT A GOOD REASON.

267
00:15:24,866 --> 00:15:26,833
- THAT'S RIGHT.
HE SURE DOES.

268
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,933
- THEN WHY?

269
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,833
- BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
MILLENNION WAS FOR.

270
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,566
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- YOUNG LADY...

271
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,900
WHEN BIG DADDY WAS MILLENNION'S
HEAD HONCHO,

272
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:38,066
IT WAS QUITE DIFFERENT
THAN IT IS NOW.

273
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:41,033
DO YOU KNOW WHY YOUR FATHER
FOUNDED THE ORGANIZATION?

274
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,566
- MM-MM.

275
00:15:42,633 --> 00:15:44,566
- BRANDON DIDN'T EITHER.

276
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:47,766
AND SO, I'M GOING TO TELL
YOU JUST AS I TOLD HIM

277
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,566
MANY YEARS AGO.

278
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:51,933
( sighs )

279
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,433
- Male Reporter:
 THIS JUST IN...

280
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,600
AN EXPLOSION OF UNKNOWN
ORIGIN HAS OCCURRED

281
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,533
AT SOUTH GATE NUMBER ONE.
ALTERNATE ROUTES ARE...

282
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
- DON'T TELL ME...

283
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,100
- ( growls )

284
00:16:18,966 --> 00:16:20,066
- Mika:
TO PROTECT?

285
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:22,566
- THAT'S RIGHT,
TO PROTECT--

286
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:26,266
NEIGHBORS, FRIENDS, FAMILIES.

287
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,766
TO PROTECT THEM,
HE NEEDED POWER.

288
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,966
TO HAVE THAT POWER,
HE NEEDED THE ORGANIZATION.

289
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:36,133
TO MAINTAIN IT,
HE NEEDED THE CODE OF IRON

290
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,733
THAT MADE BETRAYAL
PUNISHABLE BY DEATH.

291
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,433
BRANDON WAS ACCUSED
OF BETRAYING THE ORGANIZATION.

292
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,100
BUT IF HE WERE A TRAITOR,

293
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,600
HE WOULDN'T HAVE COME BACK
AFTER HIS DEATH.

294
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,766
HE COULD HAVE ONLY ONE REASON
FOR DOING THAT.

295
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,533
- THE CODE OF IRON.

296
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,100
- EXACTLY.

297
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:02,766
BRANDON HEAT
IS MILLENNION ITSELF.

298
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,100
EVEN AFTER HIS DEATH,

299
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,700
HE CONTINUES TO BE DEVOTED
TO MILLENNION.

300
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:12,800
SO NOW WE'LL PROTECT YOU,
YOUNG LADY.

301
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,800
- BUT I CAN'T--
I MEAN, I--

302
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:16,900
I CAN'T GIVE YOU
ANYTHING IN RETURN.

303
00:17:16,966 --> 00:17:18,733
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
GIVE US A THING.

304
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,900
THAT'S WHAT BEING A FAMILY
IS ALL ABOUT.

305
00:17:20,966 --> 00:17:23,133
AS LONG AS WE DON'T
BETRAY ONE ANOTHER,

306
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,766
WE'LL HAVE A BOND BETWEEN US
THAT CAN NEVER BE BROKEN.

307
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:36,400
- ALL OF A SUDDEN I FEEL LIKE
I HAVE TWO NEW GRANDPAS.

308
00:17:36,466 --> 00:17:37,566
- HEY!  HOLD ON!

309
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:39,433
I AIN'T OLD ENOUGH
TO BE A GRANDPA.

310
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,133
BUT I GUESS UNCLE
WOULD BE ALL RIGHT.

311
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,066
- ( all laugh )

312
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,666
- HMM?
- HUH?

313
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,500
- GARY.

314
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:49,700
- ( slightly gasps )

315
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:57,800
- IT AIN'T GOOD, BOSS.
