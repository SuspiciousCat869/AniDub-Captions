1
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:12,033
- ( theme music plays )

2
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:53,533
- Mika: MOM, DAD,
MR. TOKIOKA,

3
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,400
DOCTOR, WIDGE, GARY.

4
00:01:57,466 --> 00:02:01,566
FROM NOW ON,
NO MORE CRYING.

5
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:03,066
NO MORE TEARS.

6
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:07,566
( sobs )

7
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:09,800
( cries )

8
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:14,466
WAIT, WHAT NOW?

9
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:16,166
ANOTHER BATTLE?

10
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:18,800
DON'T GO.

11
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:20,766
IT'S ENOUGH.

12
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,266
NO MORE REVENGE.

13
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:27,933
DON'T GO, GRAVE.

14
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,133
STAY, PLEASE.

15
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,933
STAY WITH ME.

16
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,900
- Harry: AN EMERGENCY EXECUTIVE
MEETING AT THIS HOUR?

17
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:53,333
YOU ALL MUST BE
EXTREMELY BUSY.

18
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,366
SO LET'S CUT
TO THE CHASE, SHALL WE?

19
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:57,400
WHAT DID YOU
WANT TO DISCUSS?

20
00:02:57,466 --> 00:03:00,833
- BOSS, YOU KNOW VERY WELL
WHY WE'RE HERE.

21
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,733
BOB POUNDMAX
AND BALLADBIRD LEE,

22
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,066
OUR INFORMANTS TELL US

23
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:09,666
THAT THEY WERE BOTH
KILLED BY THE TARGET.

24
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:11,966
- AND BUNJI KUGASHIRA
HAS VANISHED.

25
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:15,500
SO THREE OF YOUR CLOSEST AIDES
ARE EITHER DEAD OR MISSING.

26
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:17,233
- IT'S CAUSED
A LOT OF CONFUSION

27
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,700
REGARDING THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.

28
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:20,366
- AH, SO THAT'S IT.

29
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,000
YEAH, I GUESS
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

30
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:24,366
MY NEW PERSONAL AIDES
WILL BE CHOSEN

31
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:26,700
FROM AMONG THE MEN
SITTING AT THIS TABLE.

32
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:28,633
BRILLIANT AND USEFUL MEN

33
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,633
WILLING TO DEMONSTRATE
THEIR LOYALTY

34
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,400
AND COMMITMENT
TO THE ORGANIZATION

35
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:34,333
BY BECOMING SUPERIORS.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,033
- BOSS,

37
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,133
PERHAPS THIS MIGHT
BE THE RIGHT TIME 

38
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,033
FOR YOU TO STEP DOWN.

39
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,400
OUR TARGET IS BRANDON HEAT,

40
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:51,100
A FORMER SWEEPER
OF THE ORGANIZATION

41
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,300
AND YOUR CLOSEST FRIEND.

42
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,933
- WHEN YOU FOUND OUT
HE WAS A TRAITOR,

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,100
YOU KILLED HIM.

44
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,666
- BOSS, WE BELIEVE
THAT BRANDON HEAT 

45
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:01,266
WANTS ONLY ONE 
THING, REVENGE.

46
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,233
IN OTHER WORDS,
IT'S YOU HE WANTS TO DESTROY.

47
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,866
NOT THE ORGANIZATION.

48
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:08,966
- SO THERE'S NO NEED FOR
THE ORGANIZATION TO BE INVOLVED.

49
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:11,200
ONCE YOU TWO SETTLE
YOUR DIFFERENCES,

50
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:12,900
THE CONFLICT WILL
BE OVER WITH,

51
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:15,433
WHICH IS WHY THIS MIGHT
BE THE RIGHT TIME.

52
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,100
- Harry: IS THIS A MUTINY?

53
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,300
- PLEASE UNDERSTAND.

54
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:23,066
WE'RE ONLY TRYING TO PROTECT
THE ORGANIZATION.

55
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:25,900
- YES, I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY.

56
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,333
I BELIEVE IN PROTECTING
THE ORGANIZATION

57
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,633
AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

58
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,400
ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU
A DEMONSTRATION.

59
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,400
- AN ORGMAN!

60
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:37,733
WHAT THE HELL?!

61
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
- ( guns click )

62
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:42,500
- ( men groan )

63
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:44,900
- ( bullets fire )

64
00:04:44,966 --> 00:04:46,700
( gunfire stops)

65
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:52,833
- ( whimpers )
- ( guns click )

66
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,100
- THERE NOW.

67
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,366
I THINK THAT SHOULD
CLEAR UP ANY CONFUSION

68
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,500
REGARDING
THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.

69
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:02,900
BISCOE, STICK AROUND.

70
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:04,266
WHEN I'VE CHOSEN
THESE REPLACEMENTS,

71
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,733
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

72
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,166
THE REST OF YOU,
PUT ALL YOUR EFFORTS

73
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:08,800
INTO FINDING THE TARGET.

74
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,533
WELL, LET'S GET GOING, BEAR.

75
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,433
YOU AND I HAVE
A LUNCH-DATE WITH SHERRY.

76
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:18,400
- ONE OF MILLENNION'S
BIG FOUR ONCE SAID

77
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:20,333
THAT YOU WERE--
WELL, NOT YOU, 

78
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,200
BUT THE YOU THAT 
WAS BRANDON HEAT.

79
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:25,533
THEY SAID THAT BRANDON HEAT
AND MY MOM WERE IN LOVE.

80
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,266
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE
I'M HER DAUGHTER,

81
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,400
BUT I THINK I'M FINALLY
BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND

82
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:33,233
WHY SHE FELL IN LOVE
WITH YOU...

83
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:40,533
AND NEVER STOPPED
LOVING YOU.

84
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,733
GRAVE, I--

85
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,833
I DON'T WANT
YOU TO DISAPPEAR.

86
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,500
LET'S GO SOMEWHERE.
SOMEPLACE FAR AWAY,

87
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:50,866
SO FAR AWAY THE ORGANIZATION
CAN'T FIND US,

88
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,166
JUST THE TWO OF US TOGETHER.

89
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:55,566
PLEASE.

90
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:04,900
WHY'D YOU TURN HER DOWN?

91
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:07,466
WHY'D YOU DISTANCE
YOURSELF FROM MY MOM?

92
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,966
- I'LL BE YOUR GUARDIAN.

93
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:18,166
- ( gasps )

94
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:20,733
- I'LL PROTECT YOU,

95
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,433
BUT THAT IS ALL I CAN DO.

96
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,266
- BUT WHY?!

97
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,600
IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE!

98
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,333
( cries )
I DON'T GET IT AT ALL.

99
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,233
( cries )

100
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,833
- ( cutlery clinks )

101
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,400
- I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING

102
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,233
YOUR FATHER'S DONE
FOR THE ORGANIZATION.

103
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,633
BUT HE'S DONE ENOUGH
AND NOW HE SHOULD RETIRE

104
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,200
AND RELAX FOR A WHILE.

105
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:48,466
TELL HIM IT'S THE RIGHT THING
TO DO, WILL YOU, HONEY?

106
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,766
- HE'S RIGHT.
YOU HAVE DONE ENOUGH.

107
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,533
- NOT AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED.

108
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,933
BESIDES, I'VE BEEN
DOING IT FOR SO LONG,

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,866
I CAN'T IMAGINE
DOING ANYTHING ELSE.

110
00:06:57,933 --> 00:06:59,733
I KNOW IT'S UNREASONABLE,

111
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,466
BUT I'VE ASKED HARRY TO LET ME
KEEP WORKING FOR A WHILE.

112
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:04,566
- YES, YOU TOOK
THE HUMBLE APPROACH.

113
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,400
- BY THE WAY, HARRY,
I'M STILL WAITING

114
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:09,200
TO SEE MY GRANDCHILD.
NOT TOO MUCH LONGER, I HOPE.

115
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:11,900
- WE'RE STILL TRYING.
IN FACT, WE TRY ALL THE TIME.

116
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:13,233
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, DEAR?

117
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,900
- HARRY, BEHAVE YOURSELF.

118
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:16,766
YOU SHOULDN'T BE SAYING
THINGS LIKE THAT

119
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,133
IN FRONT OF MY FATHER.

120
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,300
- ( phone vibrates )
- HMM?

121
00:07:19,366 --> 00:07:21,600
- ( beeps )
- GO AHEAD.

122
00:07:23,366 --> 00:07:25,766
YEAH.
YEAH, RIGHT.

123
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:27,500
- ( beeps )

124
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:30,766
- SOME BORING LITTLE
BUSINESS DEAL.

125
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,000
SORRY I HAVE TO LEAVE
SO SUDDENLY.

126
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:35,233
- OH, DADDY, WHAT A SHAME.

127
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,366
THE THREE OF US HAVEN'T
GOTTEN TOGETHER LIKE THIS

128
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:39,866
IN SUCH A LONG TIME.

129
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:41,266
- WE'LL DO IT
ANYTIME YOU LIKE.

130
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,600
ANYTIME AT ALL, RIGHT?

131
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,033
- THAT'S THE OTHER SIDE
OF HUMAN NATURE.

132
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,533
- HMM, WHAT, HARRY?

133
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,633
- OH, NOTHING.
IT WASN'T IMPORTANT.

134
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,433
- ( car approaches )

135
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,633
- WELL, HOW'S IT GOING?

136
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,266
- SO FAR SO GOOD, SIR.

137
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,066
THE TARGET'S STILL IN THERE.

138
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,200
- THANK YOU.
EXCELLENT WORK.

139
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:29,033
- THE OVERKILLS ARE
ON STANDBY ALERT

140
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,566
AWAITING YOUR ORDERS, SIR.

141
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:33,000
WE'LL BE READY TO MOVE
THE MINUTE YOU SAY IT'S A GO.

142
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:35,633
- VERY WELL.
NOW LISTEN, EVERYONE.

143
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,466
AS OF NOW, THE OVERKILLS
ARE HEREBY DISSOLVED.

144
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:40,766
- ( gasping )
- WHAT?

145
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,100
- ( muttering )
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS, SIR.

146
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,866
- AS I SAID, I'M DISSOLVING
THE OVERKILLS.

147
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:49,266
FROM THIS MOMENT ON,
YOU'RE FREE TO DO AS YOU WISH.

148
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,033
WHETHER YOU REMAIN
WITH THE ORGANIZATION

149
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,100
OR DECIDE TO TAKE
ANOTHER PATH IS UP TO YOU.

150
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:54,966
- BOSS.

151
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:57,066
- I'M COMPLETING THIS
MISSION MYSELF.

152
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:59,066
AND NOT AS A MEMBER
OF MILLENNION,

153
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:01,133
BUT AS AN INDIVIDUAL,
AS A MAN.

154
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,233
THE MAN WHO WILL CHALLENGE

155
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,966
BRANDON HEAT.

156
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:09,800
- ( gasping )
( mutters )

157
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:11,433
( whispers continue )

158
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,533
- BOSS!
- HOLD ON A SECOND.

159
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:20,433
THINK ABOUT HOW LUCKY WE WERE
TO HAVE A BOSS LIKE BEAR

160
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,600
AND WHAT WOULD HAVE
HAPPENED IF WE DIDN'T.

161
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,666
THE BOSS DIDN'T LET US

162
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:25,400
GET TURNED INTO
ORGMEN, DID HE?

163
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:27,033
FOR THAT REASON ALONE,

164
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,000
WE HAVE TO HONOR
THE BOSS'S FINAL ORDER,

165
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:32,533
THE LAST ORDER WE'LL EVER GET
FROM BEAR WALKEN.

166
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:43,900
- ( footsteps approach )

167
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,566
- ( gun clicks )
- ( gasps )

168
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,666
- WE NEED TO TALK.

169
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:57,733
IT'S A STRANGE FEELING

170
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,600
CARRYING ON A CONVERSATION

171
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,433
WITH SOMEONE
WHO'S ALREADY DIED,

172
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,000
BUT ISN'T DEAD.

173
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:04,300
IRONIC, ISN'T IT?

174
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:06,666
WHEN YOU WERE ALIVE,
YOU BARELY SAID A WORD TO ME.

175
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:09,366
BUT NOW THAT YOU'RE DEAD,
WE'RE TALKING.

176
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:13,333
THAT GIRL BACK THERE,
BIG DADDY'S LEGACY, I PRESUME?

177
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,666
WHY ARE YOU PROTECTING HER?

178
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:17,300
HER EXISTENCE WON'T CHANGE

179
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,333
WHAT THE ORGANIZATION
HAS BECOME.

180
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,100
THE MILLENNION
OF BIG DADDY'S DAY IS DEAD.

181
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,533
AND UNLIKE YOU,
IT'S GOING TO STAY THAT WAY.

182
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,000
- WHY?

183
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:30,500
TELL ME WHY!

184
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:33,933
- ( whimpers )

185
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,166
- YOU THINK THAT
WHAT I'VE DONE

186
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:45,500
MAKES ME A TRAITOR,
IS THAT IT?

187
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:48,500
I'VE APOLOGIZED TO BIG DADDY
COUNTLESS TIMES,

188
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:51,766
APOLOGIZED FROM
THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.

189
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,266
BUT I HAVE NO REGRETS

190
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,233
ABOUT THE CHOICES
I'VE HAD TO MAKE.

191
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,066
NONE AT ALL.

192
00:10:58,133 --> 00:10:59,400
MY DAUGHTER IS WITH HARRY,

193
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:01,033
HAPPIER THAN
SHE'S EVER BEEN.

194
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,833
AND I HOPE THAT
THEY'LL BE HAPPY TOGETHER

195
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,266
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

196
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:08,000
THAT'S WHY
I PROTECT MILLENNION

197
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:09,966
EVEN WHEN
IT MEANS DOING THINGS

198
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:12,000
BIG DADDY WOULD HAVE SAID
WERE WRONG.

199
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:14,766
I HAVE TO PROTECT
HARRY'S MILLENNION.

200
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,933
I CHALLENGE YOU
TO A DUEL.

201
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:23,700
I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU
AT MY ESTATE.

202
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:27,833
I WON'T LET ANYONE FROM THE
ORGANIZATION GET IN YOUR WAY.

203
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,866
YOUNG LADY, I APOLOGIZE 
FOR YOUR MOTHER'S DEATH.

204
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:40,733
- ( gasps )

205
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,133
- WHEN PAINFUL CHOICES ARE MADE,

206
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,166
YOU MUST BE READY TO DEAL
WITH IT THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

207
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,933
- ( gasping )

208
00:11:58,066 --> 00:12:01,133
- ( sniffing )

209
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:28,466
- Mika: ARE YOU GOING?

210
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,966
YOU KNOW, SOMEHOW,
THAT MAN NAMED BEAR WALKEN--

211
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:39,400
I JUST CAN'T THINK OF HIM
AS A BAD PERSON.

212
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:42,633
ARE YOU GOING TO FIGHT HIM?

213
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,133
- ( clicks )

214
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,866
- BUT WHY ARE YOU DOING IT?

215
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,633
- MILLENNION.

216
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,933
BECAUSE WE ARE MILLENNION.

217
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,666
WE ARE MILLENNION ITSELF.

218
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:59,400
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

219
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:01,533
( cries )

220
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,300
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

221
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:11,400
- BEAR, I'M HOPELESSLY DUMB,

222
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:13,266
EVEN DUMBER
THAN I USED TO BE.

223
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,400
I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT
LOYALTY TO THE ORGANIZATION

224
00:13:16,466 --> 00:13:18,266
WAS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN ANYTHING.

225
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,333
BUT WHEN I HAD
A CHANCE TO PROVE IT,

226
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,700
I CHOSE MY SCUMBAG
OF A SON INSTEAD. 

227
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:27,500
WHAT HAPPENS IN MY TERRITORY

228
00:13:27,566 --> 00:13:30,433
INCLUDING HIS CONDUCT
IS MY RESPONSIBILITY.

229
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,966
AS A MEMBER OF THE ORGANIZATION
AND AS A FATHER,

230
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:36,533
I ACCEPT THAT RESPONSIBILITY.

231
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,933
SORRY IF YOU FIND
THIS BOTHERSOME. 

232
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,333
- NOW I KNOW
HOW IT FEELS, SID.

233
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,366
I'M DOING THE SAME
THING YOU DID

234
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:48,566
FOR EXACTLY
THE SAME REASON.

235
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:50,233
EVEN THOUGH
I KNOW IT'S WRONG,

236
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,833
I HAVE TO DO IT.

237
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,333
I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF.

238
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,533
HMPH, PATHETIC,
BOTH OF US.

239
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,900
RIGHT, SID?

240
00:13:57,966 --> 00:13:59,466
- ( engine roars )

241
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:01,300

- ( whimpers )

246
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:16,100
- BEYOND THE GRAVE?

247
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:19,433
NO.

248
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,633
BRANDON HEAT.

249
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,266
- YOU FOOL.

250
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:30,666
YOU FOOL.

251
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:34,766
- ( engine roars )

252
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,366
- HMM.

253
00:15:28,566 --> 00:15:30,900
VERY CONSIDERATE
OF YOU, BRANDON,

254
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:32,633
BRINGING YOUR OWN COFFIN

255
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,000
TO THE PLACE WHERE
YOU'RE GOING TO DIE.

256
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:39,366
THANK YOU.

257
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:41,833
THAT'S WHERE I'LL PUT
YOUR CORPSE WHEN WE'RE DONE.

258
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:10,033
( grunts )

- ( rumbling )

261
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:26,200
- SO YOU AVOIDED IT.

262
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,333
- ( metal clangs )

263
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:38,266
- LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GOING
TO NEED A NEW COFFIN.

264
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,466
TO MAKE SURE YOU WEREN'T
STRONGER THAN ME,

265
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:44,766
I'VE UNDERGONE
A CERTAIN TREATMENT.

266
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,633
- ( cracking )

267
00:16:47,566 --> 00:16:48,733
- NO.

268
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:54,733
- I AM NOW A SUPERIOR.

269
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:26,966
HA!

- BRILLIANT AS ALWAYS,
BRANDON HEAT.

00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:04,600
NEVERTHELESS, I CANNOT
ALLOW YOU TO WIN THIS FIGHT.

TO YOUR GRAVE.

REST IN PEACE,

WHAT DID YOU--

299
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,000
I SEE.

300
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:41,200
THIS WAS CUSTOM-MADE,
WASN'T IT?

301

- ( cracking )

302
00:19:44,033 --> 00:19:46,333
- I WAS STUPID.

303
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,900
THE MOMENT I BECAME
OVERCONFIDENT,

304
00:19:48,966 --> 00:19:51,066
YOU USED IT AGAINST ME.

305
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,866
WELL DONE, BRANDON.
