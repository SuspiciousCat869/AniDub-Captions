1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,666
( theme music playing )

2
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,900
- ( inaudible )

3
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,600
- Maria: I HAVEN'T SEEN
HIM FOR THREE YEARS.

4
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,233
- Man 1: DID YOU
SAY BRANDON HEAT?

5
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,633
- Man 2: YEAH. THE PARTNER OF
THAT INFAMOUS HARRY MACDOWEL.

6
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,300
HE'S A DANGEROUS MAN.

7
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:42,500
- Man 1: INDEED HE IS,
FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD

8
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:44,366
HIS TRUE GRAVE UNIT IS
EVEN MORE EFFICIENT

9
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:47,466
THAN BEAR WALKEN'S OVERKILLS.

10
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:51,566
- Man 2: HE'S QUIET,
HONEST, AND HIGHLY SKILLED.

11
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:53,766
THERE'S NO WAY BIG
DADDY WOULD LEAVE HIM ALONE.

12
00:02:57,433 --> 00:03:00,366
- TAKE A LOOK, HERE COMES
THE YOUNG MAN NOW.

13
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:02,400
- SO, THAT'S HIM...

14
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,633
- BETTER LATE,
THAN NEVER BRANDON.

15
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,900
- MY APOLOGIES.

16
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:11,566
GENTLEMEN I'M BRANDON HEAT
OF MILLENNION.

17
00:03:18,433 --> 00:03:20,533
- YOU'VE BEEN INVITED HERE TODAY
BECAUSE THERE IS SOMETHING

18
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,866
I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH YOU.

19
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:25,800
EACH OF YOU OWNS HOTELS
IN THE EAST DISTRICT.

20
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:28,966
WE'D LIKE YOU TO TRANSFER THE
OWNERSHIP OF THOSE HOTELS TO US

21
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:32,600
INCLUDING OF COURSE THE
CASINOS INSIDE THE HOTELS.

22
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,966
- WHAT THE HELL?

23
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:36,433
- HOW MUCH YOU
OFFERING PER HOTEL?

24
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,533
- HOW DOES ONE
MILLION YULE SOUND?

25
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,866
- LIKE A JOKE!
IT'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH!

26
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:42,266
- IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION!

27
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,166
- THIS ENTIRE DISCUSSION
IS TOTALLY UNNECESSARY

28
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:47,600
- BOB, WHAT'S THEIR
CURRENT STATUS?

29
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,333
- THE LATEST
INFORMATION INDICATES,

30
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,900
THAT RIGHT NOW, 40 PERCENT

31
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:53,900
OF THE HOTELS IN THE EAST
DISTRICT ARE IN THE RED.

32
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:55,400
IF THIS IS ALLOWED
TO CONTINUE,

33
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:57,433
IT WILL BECOME A
FINANCIAL DISASTER.

34
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,400
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT? THE PROBLEMS

35
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:01,033
WE ARE HAVING STARTED
LESS THAN A YEAR AGO.

36
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,000
- AND THEN FOR NO APPARENT
REASON WE COULDN'T

37
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:04,100
MAKE ANY MONEY.

38
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,700
- WHICH YOU COULD
HAVE ARRANGED

39
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:07,533
IN ORDER TO HELP
US ACCEPT YOU...

40
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,566
- ( gunshot )

41
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:16,466
- Harry: PLEASE LISTEN TO WHAT I
HAVE TO SAY, I HAVE A PROPOSAL.

42
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:18,800
IN ORDER TO ENSURE YOUR
FINANCIAL STABILITY,

43
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:21,166
WE'RE OFFERING TO LEND YOU
THE FUNDING AND SECURITY

44
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:24,366
THAT ONLY THE MILLENION
ORGANIZATION CAN PROVIDE.

45
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,566
- WHY DID YOU CUT A DEAL
WITH THOSE GUYS, WHEN YOU

46
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:32,000
COULD HAVE JUST
KILLED THEM, HARRY?

47
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:35,633
- WELL, THE DEAD ARE
NOTORIOUSLY UNPRODUCTIVE.

48
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,766
ALIVE, THEY MAY PROVE
A BIT MORE USEFUL.

49
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,366
- YOU NEVER CEASE TO
AMAZE ME, HARRY.

50
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:44,566
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW EASY IT WAS
FOR YOU TO GET THEM TO AGREE.

51
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:47,133
- IT WAS BRANDON.
HE HAS BECOME THE SYMBOL

52
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,866
OF MILLENNION'S POWER.

53
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:50,900
HE'S MAINTAINING THE
ORGANIZATION'S IMAGE

54
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:52,333
FROM THE FOUNDATION UP.

55
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,533
- WHICH MAKES YOUR
JOB A LOT EASIER.

56
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,633
- THAT'S RIGHT.

57
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,366
WITH THE CASINO OWNERS
OUT OF THE WAY,

58
00:04:58,433 --> 00:05:00,566
WE'VE NEUTRALIZED
OVER 80 PERCENT

59
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,700
OF THE FORCES WHICH
OPPOSE THIS ORGANIZATION.

60
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:07,166
JUST A FEW MORE.
A FEW MORE TO GO.

61
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:11,666
- BUT LATELY, I WONDER IF
WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING

62
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:13,633
HASN'T BEEN A LITTLE
TOO HEAVY-HANDED.

63
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,933
- REALLY?

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,833
- ACCORDING TO BOB'S
INFORMATION,

65
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,100
RANDY'S HENCHMEN SEEM TO HAVE

66
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,166
BEEN SNOOPING AROUND,
INVESTIGATING YOUR ACTIVITIES.

67
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,766
- Harry: OH? WELL DONE, BOB.

68
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,233
- WHAT DO YOU PLAN
TO DO ABOUT IT?

69
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,233
- THROUGHOUT HISTORY,

70
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,766
THE TRANSITION OF POWER
FROM ONE GENERATION

71
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:33,233
TO ANOTHER HAS ALWAYS BEEN
A LITTLE CHAOTIC AND DISORDERLY.

72
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,833
- JUST LET ME KNOW WHAT TO DO.

73
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:37,700
- HERE'S HOW IT'S GONNA WORK.

74
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:39,966
BRANDON IN PLAIN SIGHT.

75
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:43,400
YOU, WORKING FROM
BEHIND THE SCENES.

76
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:48,200
- HARRY, IT'S ABOUT
THAT TIME, ISN'T IT?

77
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:51,033
- YEAH, GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

78
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,766
IF I'M LATE AGAIN I'LL HAVE
TO LISTEN TO SHERRY WHINE

79
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,833
ABOUT IT ALL NIGHT.

80
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,533
- YEAH, YOU WOULDN'T WANT
TO MAKE AN ENEMY

81
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,633
OUT OF BEAR WALKEN,
WOULD YOU, HARRY?

82
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,400
- WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

83
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:05,433
I'VE LOVED HER FROM
THE FIRST DAY I SAW HER.

84
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,233
FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.

85
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:13,933
- SO, HOW DID IT
ALL GO, BOSS MAN?

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,466
- HARRY WAS BRILLIANT, BUNJI.
- I'M SURE, HE WAS.

87
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,933
- A BONUS FOR OUR GUYS.
THEY EARNED IT.

88
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,966
- YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T SPEND
ALL THAT IN ONE NIGHT, BIG GUY.

89
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:30,033
- TELL SPENCER TO STAY HERE.
HIS TIMING'S A LITTLE OFF.

90
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,333
- ALL RIGHT, WHATEVER
YOU SAY, BRO.

91
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:40,333
- Harry: BRANDON, I THINK IT'S
TIME FOR THE TWO OF YOU

92
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,100
TO BE FORMALLY INTRODUCED.

93
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:46,933
I BELIEVE YOU ALREADY KNOW HER.
THIS IS SHERRY WALKEN.

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,033
WE'RE GONNA BE SEEING
A WHOLE LOT OF EACH OTHER.

95
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:51,100
- I SEE...

96
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,833
- MY PLAN IS TO MARRY HER,
IF SHE'LL HAVE ME, OF COURSE.

97
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:57,666
- CONGRATULATIONS, HARRY.

98
00:06:57,733 --> 00:07:00,000
CONGRATULATIONS, SHERRY.

99
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:01,333
- THANK YOU, VERY MUCH.

100
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,700
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
ARE YOU SEEING ANYONE?

101
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:09,266
DON'T YOU HAVE SOMEONE
SPECIAL IN YOUR LIFE?

102
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,200
- AFRAID NOT.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

103
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,666
OF COURSE HE DOES, SHERRY.
A VERY SPECIAL SOMEONE.

104
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:17,833
- OH, SURE YOU DO.
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

105
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,366
OF COURSE YOU'VE GOT SOMEONE.
I'D BE SURPRISED IF YOU DIDN'T.

106
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:28,266
- Big Daddy: BRANDON,
WE MISSED YOU

107
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,733
AT MARIA'S BIRTHDAY
PARTY LAST MONTH.

108
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,700
WE WERE EXPECTING
TO SEE YOU THERE.

109
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:35,433
- WHY DIDN'T YOU COME?
- I HAD TO WORK.

110
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,266
- SHE'S REALLY QUITE
FOND OF THE DRESS

111
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,400
YOU GAVE HER AS A BIRTHDAY GIFT.

112
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:42,166
IT'S THE SAME BRAND SHE'S
TAKEN A LIKING TOO, LATELY.

113
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:44,833
- I ASKED YOUR BUTLER
WHAT KIND SHE LIKED.

114
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,300
- AH, YES, I SEE...
- YES, SIR.

115
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:52,200
- WHY DON'T YOU GO AND SEE HER?

116
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:06,000
I KNOW THAT SHE IS VERY
CONCERNED ABOUT YOU.

117
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:08,466
- IS THAT A REQUEST, OR
IS IT AN ORDER FROM

118
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:10,933
THE BOSS OF THE ORGANIZATION?

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,266
- IF YOU KEEP THINKING THAT
WAY, YOUR GONNA WIND UP

120
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,800
SPENDING THE REST OF YOUR LIFE,

121
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:17,933
AS A LONELY BACHELOR,
LIKE I HAVE.

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,133
- DO YOU REGRET IT?
- WELL, I'M BEGINNING TO.

123
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,866
IN THAT REGARD, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO FOLLOWING IN MY FOOTSTEPS.

124
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:32,233
THAT'S HOW I FEEL
ABOUT YOU, BRANDON.

125
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,500
- Man 1: HERE'S TO BRANDON!
- Man 2: HERE'S TO TRUE GRAVE!

126
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:41,200
- All: CHEERS!

127
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:49,700
- BUNJI! SORRY TO
BOTHER YOU, SIR.

128
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:50,800
- WELL?

129
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:52,833
- THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE THE
BIG MAN, I WAS WONDERING

130
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,966
IF YOU COULD TELL HIM,
"THANKS A LOT."

131
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,300
- THANKS FOR WHAT?

132
00:08:56,366 --> 00:08:57,500
- I FOUND OUT
THAT HE PAID OFF

133
00:08:57,566 --> 00:08:59,333
ALL MY MOM'S MEDICAL EXPENSES.

134
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,066
AND HE DID IT WITHOUT
EVEN TELLING ME.

135
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:03,633
SHE'S BEEN IN THE HOSPITAL
FOR OVER A MONTH.

136
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,400
I NEVER MENTIONED IT TO HIM.

137
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:06,833
- THANK HIM YOURSELF.

138
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,633
- ME? I'M JUST AN INTERN.

139
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,033
I CAN'T JUST WALK UP AND
TALK TO BRANDON HEAT.

140
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,600
I'M TOTALLY IN AWE OF THE GUY.

141
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,500
- SO YOU CAN'T TALK TO HIM?

142
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:17,933
BUT YOU GOT NO PROBLEM
TALKING TO ME, RIGHT?

143
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:21,666
- ( groaning )

144
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:25,400
THERE'S ONE THING
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND...

145
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:27,300
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY
A GUY LIKE BRANDON

146
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,766
WOULD JOIN THE MAFIA
TO BEGIN WITH.

147
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,600
IT MAKES SENSE FOR GUYS
LIKE THE ONES OVER THERE.

148
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,233
THEY WANT MONEY.
THEY WANNA MAKE IT BIG.

149
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,733
THEY WANT BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.

150
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,900
THEY LIKE GETTING ROWDY
WITH THEIR BUDDIES.

151
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:40,566
I'M SURE THERE'S LOTS
OF OTHER REASONS,

152
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:43,666
BUT THEY ALL PRETTY MUCH
WANT THE SAME THING.

153
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:45,533
BUT BRANDON'S NOT
THAT KIND OF GUY,

154
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,300
HE'S DIFFERENT SOMEHOW.

155
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:49,966
- WANNA KNOW WHY?
- YEAH.

156
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:52,966
- THE ARMOR AROUND HIS HEART.

157
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:56,766
SOLID STEEL ARMOR SO STRONG THAT
NO ONE WILL EVER GET INSIDE.

158
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,600
- Man: EXCUSE ME, SIR.

159
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,966
THERE'S A CALL FROM
HEADQUARTERS ABOUT A JOB.

160
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:05,233
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL TAKE IT.

161
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,600
- THANK YOU, HARRY.
I HAD SO MUCH FUN, TONIGHT.

162
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,500
- WELL, NEXT TIME WE'LL
HAVE EVEN MORE FUN.

163
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:15,766
TILL BREAKFAST TIME...

164
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,833
- NOW I'M BLUSHING.

165
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:21,000
- GOOD NIGHT, SHERRY.

166
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:39,233
- SHERRY...
- DADDY!

167
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,633
BUT DADDY, HOW COME? GIVE
ME ONE GOOD REASON WHY

168
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,133
I SHOULDN'T GO OUT WITH HARRY.

169
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,300
- HARRY MACDOWEL IS
A BONAFIDE MEMBER OF THE MAFIA.

170
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:58,666
THAT MAN IS
SURROUNDED BY DANGER.

171
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:00,533
WHICH MEANS THAT THOSE
WHO ARE CLOSE TO HIM,

172
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,000
ARE IN DANGER AS WELL.

173
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:03,966
- THEN I'M IN DANGER RIGHT NOW!

174
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:06,633
BECAUSE YOUR THE BIGGEST
MAFIOSO OF THEM ALL.

175
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,000
- DO YOU WANT TO END UP
LIKE YOUR MOTHER?

176
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,566
I CAN'T ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN.
NOT TO YOU.

177
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,700
- DADDY, I'M THE DAUGHTER
OF A GANGSTER.

178
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:23,833
I'VE BEEN PREPARING FOR
THIS MOMENT ALL MY LIFE.

179
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,933
I'M PREPARED TO DIE
FOR HARRY, IF I HAVE TO.

180
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,866
IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOUR
PREPARED TO DIE, FOR BIG DADDY.

181
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:33,733
- WHAT A STUBBORN YOUNG LADY.

182
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,000
- WELL, LIKE FATHER
LIKE DAUGHTER.

183
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:37,766
- RUNS IN THE FAMILY, I GUESS.

184
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:41,166
- I'LL PREVAIL IN THE END,
I KNOW IT.

185
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,233
MY LOVE WILL PREVAIL.
YOU'LL SEE.

186
00:12:01,766 --> 00:12:05,233
- KIDNAPPING A POLITICIAN'S
DAUGHTER IS SO EASY.

187
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,033
AND YOU BLEW IT COMPLETELY,
YOU MORON. WHAT A PUNK.

188
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,166
SO, NOW I HAVE TO WASTE
MY TIME DOING THIS.

189
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,666
- ( Man ) THERE'S ONE THING,
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND...

190
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:17,400
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY
A GUY LIKE BRANDON

191
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:19,466
WOULD JOIN THE MAFIA
TO BEGIN WITH.

192
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:21,200
- ( car engine starting )

193
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:29,800
- ( car crashing )

194
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,466
- ( exclaims )

195
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,633
- I MUST BE GETTING SENILE...

196
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,633
TO LET MYSELF BE CAUGHT
OFFGUARD BY A PUNK LIKE YOU.

197
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,966
- W-WAIT!
P-PLEASE! DON'T KILL ME!

198
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:53,666
PLEASE! I'M BEGGING YOU!
DON'T KILL ME!

199
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:58,033
( sobbing ) PLEASE DON'T KILL
ME... PLEASE DON'T KILL ME...

200
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,133
- YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF
YOURSELF, BUNJI KUGASHIRA.

201
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,533
- WHY DID YOU DO
THIS ON YOUR OWN?

202
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:27,800
ANSWER ME, BUNJI!

203
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,366
- IT WAS AN INSIGNIFICANT JOB.

204
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:34,666
- HE WAS JUST TRYING NOT
TO BOTHER YOU ABOUT IT, BRANDON.

205
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:37,066
I'M SURE HE WON'T
EVER DO IT AGAIN.

206
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:40,233
- ( groans )

207
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,666
- GO SEE THE DOCTOR.
- NAH, IT'S JUST A SCRATCH.

208
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:47,166
- THAT'S AN ORDER.
- JUST GO. ALL RIGHT, BUNJI?

209
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,766
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO.

210
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,766
- LOOK BRANDON, YOU
HAVE TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND.

211
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,733
THAT WHAT HAPPENED
TONIGHT, IS PRECISELY WHY

212
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,933
WE DON'T HIM TO ACT ON HIS OWN.

213
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,566
TELL HIM THAT YOU'RE
WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

214
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:08,066
THAT YOUR HIS FRIEND.

215
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:09,600
- HE'S GOT A LOT OF PRIDE.

216
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,033
BUNJI KUGASHIRA
IS A TRUE MAN.

217
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,466
- I WAS TOLD THAT
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

218
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:22,633
- YES, MARIA.

219
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,400
- WHAT IS IT ABOUT, UNCLE?

220
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:27,266
- WELL, NO REAL REASON
IN PARTICULAR...

221
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,633
- WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT,
AND WE'LL TALK ALL RIGHT?

222
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,666
- SURE.

223
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:36,066
- THERE'S A YOUNG MAN, A
CHILDHOOD FRIEND OF YOURS,

224
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:37,766
WHO UP UNTIL ABOUT
THREE YEARS AGO,

225
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,833
USED TO COME HERE TO VISIT YOU.

226
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,666
- YOU MEAN BRANDON?

227
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:44,600
- THAT'S RIGHT. BRANDON.
BRANDON HEAT...

228
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,533
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, I PUT
HIM AND HIS FRIEND IN CHARGE

229
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,200
OF ONE OF MY COMPANIES,
AND AS A RESULT,

230
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:55,166
THAT COMPANY HAS BEEN
DOING INCREDIBLY WELL LATELY.

231
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:56,733
- BRANDON AND HARRY?

232
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,700
- RIGHT. WELL, IT SEEMS
TO ME, THAT THEY BOTH

233
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,200
HAVE BRIGHT FUTURES.
AND SINCE THEY'RE NOT

234
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:04,700
STRANGERS TO ME, AND HAVE
SHOWN SO MUCH PROGRESS

235
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:07,100
I WAS WONDERING, WHAT
WOULD YOU THINK

236
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,133
OF MY ASKING THEM TO
BECOME MY PARTNERS?

237
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,800
TO HELP ME RUN MY COMPANY
AND TO EVENTUALLY SUCCEED ME.

238
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:15,766
NATURALLY, ONLY THEY
CAN DECIDE WHETHER

239
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,733
OR NOT TO ACCEPT MY OFFER.

240
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,100
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT...

241
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,766
MARIA, I'D LIKE TO
KNOW HOW YOU FEEL

242
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,433
ABOUT WHAT I'M
PLANNING TO DO.

243
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,433
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, MARIA?

244
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,633
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

245
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,600
- SO, BRANDON WILL
TAKE OVER THE ORGANIZATION...

246
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:39,333
- THE ORGANIZATION?
WHAT IN THE WORLD DO YOU MEAN?

247
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,033
- THANKS FOR YOUR SENSITIVITY,
UNCLE. BUT I ALREADY KNOW.

248
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,533
I KNOW WHAT YOU DO,
UNCLE. AND I KNOW

249
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,700
WHAT UNCLE JESTER
USED TO DO TOO.

250
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:53,900
I ALSO KNOW WHAT BRANDON AND
HARRY ARE DOING NOW.

251
00:15:56,766 --> 00:16:00,200
- I SEE...
SO, YOU'VE KNOWN ALL ALONG.

252
00:16:01,366 --> 00:16:04,500
- I FIGURED IT OUT
FOUR YEARS AGO.

253
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:07,200
IN ORDER TO VERIFY IT, I
DID SOME INVESTIGATING

254
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,733
ON MY OWN. OF YOU
AND A FEW OTHERS.

255
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,200
I'M SORRY.

256
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:14,300
- NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE.
MY REASON FOR HIDING

257
00:16:14,366 --> 00:16:14,900
THE TRUTH FROM YOU...

258
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:16,533
- I KNOW THAT, TOO.

259
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,866
UNCLE JESTER DIDN'T WANT
ME TO BE INVOLVED.

260
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:22,366
HE WANTED ME TO LEAD
A NORMAL LIFE.

261
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:24,633
THAT'S WHY YOU TRIED TO RAISE ME

262
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,733
AS IF I WERE AN
ORDINARY GIRL.

263
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,633
LEADING AN ORDINARY LIFE.

264
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,466
FOR WHICH I'M GRATEFUL.
THANK YOU, UNCLE...

265
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:34,700
AFTER UNCLE JESTER
PASSED AWAY,

266
00:16:34,766 --> 00:16:38,500
YOU OFFERED TO TAKE ME IN,
ABOUT SIX MONTHS LATER

267
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:39,700
BRANDON DROPPED BY TO SEE ME.

268
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:42,966
I REMEMBERED THAT FIRST TIME
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.

269
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:44,500
I WAS SO HAPPY.

270
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,133
HAPPIER THAN I'D
EVER BEEN BEFORE.

271
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:54,900
BUT BY THEN, BRANDON HAD
ALREADY JOINED THE ORGANIZATION.

272
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,766
AT THE TIME, I HAD NO IDEA...

273
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,966
- IT WAS BECAUSE OF HIS FRIEND
HARRY, AND BECAUSE OF YOU,

274
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:03,900
I IMAGINE

275
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:06,833
THAT HE DECIDED TO JOIN
THE ORGANIZATION.

276
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,533
BECAUSE THE ONLY THING THAT
MATTERED TO HIM,

277
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,766
WAS HAVING ENOUGH POWER
TO PROTECT THE ONES HE LOVED.

278
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,633
EVEN IF HE HAD TO SACRIFICE
HIS OWN HUMANITY.

279
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,800
ONCE I GOT TO KNOW HIM,
I TOOK HIM UNDER MY WING.

280
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,300
WELL, DO YOU RESENT
ME FOR DOING IT?

281
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:33,700
- THAT'S JUST THE WAY HE IS.
HE NEVER GIVES UP OR GIVES IN.

282
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:34,833
HE'S DETERMINED
TO REACH

283
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,900
WHATEVER GOAL HE
SETS FOR HIMSELF

284
00:17:36,966 --> 00:17:39,500
AND NEVER STOPS TRYING,
NO MATTER WHAT.

285
00:17:39,566 --> 00:17:43,033
AS FOR HIS NOT COMING TO SEE ME
FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS, WELL,

286
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,300
I'M SURE HE HAS A GOOD REASON.

287
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:47,233
- PURE AWKWARDNESS.

288
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,033
HE THINKS BECAUSE HE
ABANDONED HIS HUMANITY,

289
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,900
HE CAN'T MAKE YOU HAPPY.

290
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:54,333
YET YOUR HAPPINESS MEANS
INFINITELY MORE TO HIM

291
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,700
THAN HIS OWN.

292
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:57,633
BECAUSE BRANDON
IS THAT KIND OF MAN.

293
00:17:58,433 --> 00:18:00,700
AND BECAUSE HE LOVES YOU.

294
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,833
- ( crying )

295
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:06,000
BRANDON...

296
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:11,333
BRANDON...

297
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,000
- MARIA, I'M SO VERY SORRY.

298
00:18:14,066 --> 00:18:17,266
I DIDN'T MEAN TO CAUSE YOU
ALL THIS PAIN AND SORROW.

299
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:20,433
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WANT,
ANYTHING WITHIN MY POWER,

300
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,166
I'LL ORDER HIM TO COME SEE YOU,
IF YOU ASK ME TOO.

301
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,366
- NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT...

302
00:18:27,433 --> 00:18:31,466
IF HE WANTS ME TO BE HAPPY,
THEN I WILL BE, FOR HIS SAKE.

303
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:35,066
SO I WILL BE HAPPY.
I'LL MAKE MYSELF BE HAPPY.

304
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:38,200
FOR HIM. FOR HIS HAPPINESS.

305
00:18:41,733 --> 00:18:42,733
FOR HIM...

306
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,300
- BIG MAN,
WE'VE JUST GOT SOME BAD NEWS.

307
00:18:48,366 --> 00:18:50,733
THERE'S A TRAITOR
IN THE ORGANIZATION!

308
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,833
TRUE GRAVE HAS BEEN
GIVEN SOLE AUTHORITY

309
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,333
TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION.

310
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,400
- RIGHT, LET'S GO.

311
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,533
- ( footsteps )

312
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:12,166
- ( rattling )

313
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:13,833
- HMM?

314
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,633
- Harry: DR. TOKIOKA.

315
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:19,666
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

316
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:25,833
- SO. IT'S YOU.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

317
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,400
I WAS JUST REMEMBERING
OUR CONVERSATION,

318
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:32,933
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU,
HARRY MACDOWEL.

319
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:37,733
WHAT? CONTINUE OUR
NECROLYZATION RESEARCH?

320
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,166
- Harry: THAT'S RIGHT.
I'LL SUPPLY ALL THE FUNDS

321
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:42,000
YOU NEED FOR YOUR RESEARCH.

322
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:44,533
AND I'LL GUARANTEE YOUR SAFETY,
AS WELL.

323
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,900
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
YOU'VE ALREADY WITNESSED

324
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:48,566
THE POWER OF NECROLYZATION!
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN

325
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:51,233
WHAT YOU'VE SEEN
WITH YOUR OWN EYES?

326
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,866
IT'S EVIL.

327
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:55,200
IT'S THE TECHNOLOGY
OF THE SATAN!

328
00:19:56,866 --> 00:19:59,066
- YOU KNEW THAT SOME TIME AGO.

329
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:02,000
BUT YOU DIDN'T LET IT STOP YOU
FROM CONTINUING YOUR RESEARCH,

330
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:03,600
DID YOU?

331
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:08,300
IF YOU HAD ANY REAL DEDICATION
TO MORALITY, DECENCY OR JUSTICE,

332
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:09,266
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE CONTINUED

333
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,566
WITH YOUR SO CALLED
SATANIC RESEARCH,

334
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:14,200
EVEN WHEN YOU WERE BEING
THREATENED BY LIGHTNING.

335
00:20:14,266 --> 00:20:16,033
BUT YOUR RESEARCH DIDN'T STOP.

336
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,600
YOU KEPT ON TRYING TO
CORRECT YOUR MISTAKES.

337
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,333
BECAUSE YOU WERE
ENSNARED IN THE TRAP

338
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,466
OF SCIENTIFIC AMBITION
AND COULDN'T ESCAPE.

339
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,366
- STILL, THE RESULTS
OF MY RESEARCH

340
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:30,133
MUST BE SEALED FOREVER.

341
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,766
- OH, WONDERFUL. I THOUGHT
YOU DIDN'T HAVE A

342
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,733
MORAL BONE IN
YOUR BODY, DOCTOR.

343
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,000
SO IMAGINE HOW SURPRISED
I AM BY YOUR DECISION

344
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:40,333
TO DIE HERE AND NOW,
WITHOUT LEAVING ANY PROOF

345
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,366
WHATSOEVER OF YOUR
SCIENTIFIC GENIUS.

346
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,733
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU,
THE TECHNOLOGY

347
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,500
YOU'VE ALREADY DEVELOPED
WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE.

348
00:20:49,566 --> 00:20:52,233
YOU WILL EITHER QUIETLY
WITNESS IT FROM AFAR,

349
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,666
OR MAKE A INDELIBLE IMPRINT IN
THE HISTORICAL ANALS OF THE

350
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:57,100
INTERNATIONAL
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY

351
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:00,066
AS AN UNPARALLELED GENIUS.

352
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,466
I DON'T NEED TO ASK
WHAT YOUR CHOICE IS.

353
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:06,066
THERE REALLY IS NO
CHOICE, IS THERE?

354
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:09,633
- WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO
WITH NECROLYZATION?

355
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,333
- NOTHING, NOTHING AT
ALL I HAVE NO INTENTION

356
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,866
OF USING IT. HOWEVER,
WE OF THE MILLENNION

357
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:19,800
ORGANIZATION HAVE TO
BE ABLE TO DEFEND OURSELVES.

358
00:21:19,866 --> 00:21:21,566
AGAINST THE THREAT
OF DESTRUCTION

359
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:23,933
BY A GROUP SUCH AS LIGHTNING.

360
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,433
THINK OF IT AS A DETERRENT,
WHICH BY IT'S VERY EXISTENCE

361
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,200
WILL ELIMINATE SILLY
AND UNNECESSARY CONFLICTS.

362
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,233
SO, THIS IS NECROLYZATION?

363
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,233
- YES, I'M CALLING IT
VERSION NUMBER 2.

364
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,400
IN TERMS OF
SUSTAINED MAINTENANCE,

365
00:21:44,466 --> 00:21:47,366
THE ENTIRE BLOOD SUPPLY IN
THE ENTITY MUST BE REPLACED

366
00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:48,566
AS LONG AS THAT'S DONE,

367
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:51,500
IT WILL BE ALMOST
PERMANENTLY FUNCTIONAL.

368
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:55,566
IT'S SIMPLY AMAZING
HOW FAR WE'VE COME.

369
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:59,266
EVEN THOUGH THE ROAD WE'RE ON
IS LEADING US DOWN TO HELL.

370
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,633
- DOWN, DOCTOR?

371
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,766
YOU'RE WRONG, ABOUT THAT,
BELIEVE ME.

372
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,233
I'M GOING UP.

373
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,066
WHAT I'M HEADING FOR
ISN'T HELL, BUT FREEDOM.

374
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:13,100
THE FREEDOM TO TAKE WHATEVER
I LIKE, WHENEVER I LIKE

375
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,266
AND EVEN GIVE IT AWAY IF I LIKE.

376
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:18,066
THAT'S THE KIND OF FREEDOM
THAT IS WAITING FOR ME!

377
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:20,133
- UH...

378
00:22:23,866 --> 00:22:28,333
- YES, THIS POWER WILL GIVE ME A
BOOST IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

379
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,133
ALL THE WAY UP, TO A MUCH,
MUCH HIGHER PLACE.

380
00:22:35,366 --> 00:22:38,066
( maniacal laughter )

381
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,033
- ( pop song playing )

382
00:22:57,666 --> 00:23:00,833
- ( man singing )

383
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:18,633
- Brandon: SHE WAS
LOOKING FOR COMFORT.

384
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,866
SHE WAS WISHING FOR HAPPINESS.

385
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:25,333
BUT I CANNOT
RESPOND TO HER NEEDS,

386
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,900
BECAUSE WHAT I WANT
IS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
