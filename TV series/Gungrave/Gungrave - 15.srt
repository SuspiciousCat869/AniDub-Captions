1
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:13,366
( theme music playing )

2
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,766
- ( inaudible )

3
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,833
- Big Daddy: SO YOU LEARNED
THAT BRANDON HAD BETRAYED US.

4
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,466
STOLEN FROM THE ORGANIZATION.

5
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:03,600
WHEN YOU CONFRONTED HIM,
HE DREW HIS WEAPON.

6
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,966
YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR BEST
FRIEND INTENDED TO KILL YOU.

7
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:10,066
YOU HAD TO REACT.
IT WAS KILL OR BE KILLED.

8
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,100
YOU HAD NO CHOICE, RIGHT?

9
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:20,300
- YES.
- THAT IS A LIE!

10
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,833
- ( chuckles )

11
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,333
- I CONTROL OVER 80 PERCENT

12
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,733
OF MILLENNION'S
OPERATIONS RIGHT NOW.

13
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,133
EVENTUALLY I'LL CONTROL IT ALL.

14
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,466
AND IF YOU THINK YOU CAN
STOP ME, GO AHEAD AND TRY.

15
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:32,700
BUT I'D HATE TO SEE
BLOODSHED UNNECESSARILY,

16
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:35,900
ESPECIALLY AMONG
MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY.

17
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:40,533
- IN THAT CASE, YOU SHOULDN'T
MIND, KILLING ME, HARRY.

18
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,700
- NOT YET. I STILL NEED
YOU AROUND TO MAKE IT APPEAR

19
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:46,466
AS THOUGH YOU'VE CHOSEN
ME AS YOUR SUCCESSOR.

20
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,733
OF COURSE, I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL.

21
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,333
JUST EXIST, THAT'S ALL I ASK.

22
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,666
- TELL ME,
WHY DID YOU SHOOT BRANDON?

23
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,833
- BECAUSE HE POINTED
A GUN AT ME.

24
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,733
MY NAME IS HARRY MACDOWEL.
I'M THE NEW BOSS OF MILLENNION.

25
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,400
FROM NOW ON,
I'LL LIVE FOR THE FAMILY,

26
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:28,266
AND FIGHT FOR THE FAMILY,

27
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,233
AND BE WILLING TO DIE
FOR THE FAMILY.

28
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,300
JUST AS ALL OF YOU
WILL LIVE FOR THE FAMILY,

29
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:36,333
AND FIGHT FOR THE FAMILY,

30
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,066
AND BE WILLING TO DIE
FOR THE FAMILY.

31
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,233
- Bob: HEY, LEE.
- YEAH, BOB, WHAT IS IT?

32
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,733
- LEE, YOU KNOW BRANDON.

33
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,433
DO YOU THINK HE BETRAYED
THE ORGANIZATION

34
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,866
THE WAY THEY SAY HE DID?

35
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:01,400
- I DON'T KNOW. YOU TELL ME.

36
00:04:01,466 --> 00:04:04,366
LISTEN, HARRY KILLS BRANDON,
THEN CALLS HIM A TRAITOR

37
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:06,000
AND BRANDON CAN'T DENY IT.

38
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:07,533
THE TRAITOR WAS
HARRY'S BEST FRIEND

39
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,133
BUT HE KILLED HIM ANYWAY.

40
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,866
THAT'S ALL WE REALLY KNOW.

41
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:13,000
THEN HARRY CLIMBS ANOTHER
RUNG UP THE LADDER

42
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:14,433
AND HE'LL KEEP ON CLIMBING.

43
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,266
HE'LL KEEP GOING TILL
HE GETS TO THE TOP

44
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,533
AND SEES THE VIEW THAT
YOU AND I CANNOT EVER SEE.

45
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,866
- ( laughing )

46
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,300
- Man: I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

47
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:38,466
- ME EITHER.

48
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:41,633
BRANDON, THE BIG GUY,
NO WAY THAT GUY IS A TRAITOR.

49
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,300
- YOU ASK ME.
HE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.

50
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,466
BRANDON JUST WASN'T
THAT KIND OF GUY.

51
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:48,633
- JUST WHAT KIND OF GUY WAS HE?

52
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,233
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYMORE THAN I DO

53
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,366
AND I KNEW HIM A HELL OF
A LOT BETTER THAN YOU DID.

54
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:53,666
- MEANING WHAT?

55
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:57,033
- BRANDON BROKE THE CODE OF IRON
AND BETRAYED THE ORGANIZATION.

56
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,166
HARRY FOUND OUT
WHAT BRANDON WAS UPTO

57
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,833
AND HE DID WHAT HE HAD TO DO.
EXECUTED A TRAITOR.

58
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,400
AND THAT'S THE END OF IT.

59
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:04,933
UNDERSTAND?

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,233
HE'S GONE, END OF STORY.
FORGET ABOUT HIM.

61
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:14,833
LOOK, GUYS, WE GOT
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT

62
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,566
AS LONG AS WE DO ONE THING.

63
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:18,933
BE FAITHFUL TO THE CODE OF IRON.

64
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,933
AND THAT WAY,
I WON'T EVER HAVE TO SHOOT YOU.

65
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,366
- HARRY MACDOWEL IS NOW
THE NEW BOSS OF MILLENNION.

66
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:31,566
ARE YOU SURE THAT WAS
THE BEST DECISION, BIG DADDY.

67
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:34,366
- HE AGREED TO MAINTAIN HARMONY
WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION.

68
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:37,066
SO YES, I THINK
I MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE.

69
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:39,666
- YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR MIND.
THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU.

70
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:42,500
DOES BRANDON HEAT'S DEATH
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS?

71
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:45,500
- IN A WAY.
- IN A WAY?

72
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:50,033
- BEAR, I'M GOING TO REVEAL
THIS ONLY TO YOU.

73
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,466
- THE TRUTH IS...
MARIA IS PREGNANT.

74
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:54,933
- MMM-HMM?

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,766
- THE CHILD IS MINE, OF COURSE.

76
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,066
BRANDON'S DEATH WAS
JUST TOO MUCH FOR HER.

77
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:01,800
SHE HASN'T SAID A WORD SINCE.

78
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:04,166
SHE'S LIKE A FRAGILE STATUE
THAT'LL CRUMBLE

79
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:06,200
AT THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH.

80
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:09,000
- HOW MUCH DID YOU TELL
HER ABOUT BRANDON?

81
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:12,066
- FOR HER SAKE,
I TOLD HER ONLY THAT HE DIED.

82
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:16,333
I WAS AFRAID TELLING HER MORE
WOULD ONLY WORSEN HER CONDITION.

83
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,400
MARIA HAS SUCH HIGH
HOPES FOR THE FUTURE.

84
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:21,400
FOR A NEW BEGINNING.

85
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:23,733
SHE WANTS TO RAISE OUR CHILD

86
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,766
TO LEAD A PEACEFUL,
ORDINARY LIFE.

87
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,733
AND FULFILLING THAT WISH
IS ALL I CARE ABOUT.

88
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:34,433
DOES THIS MAKE ME A TRAITOR
TO MY VERY OWN FAMILY?

89
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,000
- COURSE NOT. BECAUSE
YOU'RE NO LONGER THE BOSS

90
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:38,933
OF THE ORGANIZATION ANYMORE.

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,666
IN FACT YOU'RE NOT EVEN
A MEMBER NOW.

92
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:44,666
AND THAT MEANS THAT THE
CODE OF IRON DOESN'T APPLY.

93
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:47,033
- SO WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING?
WHAT'S NEXT?

94
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,766
- HARRY MACDOWEL. I'VE GOTTA
PROTECT THE ARROGANT BASTARD.

95
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:53,200
FOR MILLENNION.

96
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:55,800
AND FOR SHERRY.

97
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:04,700
- YOU DID IT. YOU GOT
ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP, BABY.

98
00:07:04,766 --> 00:07:06,900
HARRY MACDOWEL, YOU'RE THE BEST.

99
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:09,400
- THANKS, SWEETHEART.
SO ARE YOU.

100
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:12,233
- HARRY, I, UM...
- HMM?

101
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,133
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER A LONG TIME
AND I KEEP LOOKING AT MY FINGER

102
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,866
BUT WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR
STILL ISN'T THERE.

103
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:20,500
- I JUST NEED A LITTLE MORE
TIME, SWEETHEART. THAT'S ALL.

104
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,566
THINGS ALWAYS TAKE
A WHILE TO SETTLE DOWN

105
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:24,733
WHEN THERE'S A NEW GUY
AT THE TOP GIVING ORDERS.

106
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,066
THERE COULD EVEN
BE SOME TROUBLE

107
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:27,600
AND THINGS COULD GET DANGEROUS.

108
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,000
- STOP WORRYING.
MY DADDY AND HIS OVERKILLS

109
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:32,133
WILL NEVER LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO US.

110
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,700
- YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

111
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:36,366
IT'S JUST THAT I WANT TO BE
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN YOU'RE SAFE.

112
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:38,000
- YOU'RE A WISE MAN, HARRY.

113
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:41,500
- NO, JUST TIMID AND DUMB.
REALLY DUMB.

114
00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:46,600
I THOUGHT HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND,
NOT A TRAITOR.

115
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,633
- OH, HARRY,
YOU CAN'T BLAME YOURSELF.

116
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,866
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

117
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:52,933
BRANDON IS THE ONE WHO BETRAYED
THE ORGANIZATION, DARLING.

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,366
IT WASN'T YOU.

119
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,933
I KNOW YOU'LL NEVER
FORGET WHAT HAPPENED

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,233
AND HOW MUCH IT HURT YOU.

121
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,100
BUT YOU'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG.

122
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,366
YOU HAD A DIFFICULT
CHOICE TO MAKE.

123
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:03,333
AND IT WAS
THE RIGHT CHOICE, DEAR.

124
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:07,033
- I'M SORRY. IT STILL HURTS.

125
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:08,833
- HARRY...

126
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,400
- ( phone ringing )

127
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:17,566
- Woman: BOSS, MR. AUSTIN
IS HERE TO SEE YOU.

128
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:20,500
- Harry: SEND HIM IN.
- RIGHT AWAY, SIR.

129
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,466
- THANKS FOR COMING, MR. AUSTIN.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

130
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:29,066
- THE PLEASURE IS ALL MINE.

131
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,900
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR
PROMOTION, MR. MACDOWEL.

132
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:35,300
NOT THAT I AM SURPRISED.
CREAM ALWAYS RISES TO THE TOP.

133
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:37,466
BUT AT YOUR AGE,
NOW THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

134
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:39,533
- I WAS JUST LUCKY, THAT'S ALL.

135
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:51,333
- ( inaudible )

136
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:08,466
- BOB, IN YOUR OPINION,
WHICH MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY

137
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:11,433
WOULD BE CAPABLE OF LEADING
A REBELLION AGAINST HARRY?

138
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,266
- WELL, BISCOE OR
NORTON FOR SURE.

139
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,566
KEITH, I DON'T KNOW, POSSIBLY.

140
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:17,500
WE PULLED ALL THE
STRINGS WE NEED TO.

141
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:20,133
AND OF COURSE, BIG DADDY
GAVE HARRY HIS BLESSING.

142
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,466
SO WE DON'T GET MANY COMPLAINTS.

143
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:25,633
- BISCOE...
HE'S GOT A LOT OF CONTACTS.

144
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,600
IF WE DON'T KEEP HIM
UNDER SURVEILLANCE,

145
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,333
HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO
STRENGTHEN HIS POSITION.

146
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,966
- I'VE ALREADY DEALT
WITH BISCOE.

147
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:33,900
- ( all gasp )

148
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:36,633
- JUST WENT TO SAY HELLO
AND HE GOT THE POINT.

149
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:44,300
- WELCOME HOME, DEAR.

150
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:46,033
- WELCOME HOME, DADDY!

151
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,833
- HOW'S MY GIRL?

152
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,533
WHAT'S THIS? LOOKS LIKE
SOMEONE GOT A NEW DOLL.

153
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,466
WHO GAVE IT TO YOU? YOUR MOM?

154
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:56,100
- NO, DADDY, HARRY DID.
- HMM!

155
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:06,300
- FORGIVE THE INTRUSION,
THIS SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG.

156
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:10,366
- HARRY, I MEAN, BOSS...
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

157
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:13,100
- YOU'RE A WELL RESPECTED
ELDER OF THIS FAMILY.

158
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,933
BUT I'M JUST
A SHALLOW YOUNG MAN.

159
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,366
SO I CAME TO YOU INSTEAD OF
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

160
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:20,400
- LOOK, DADDY, LOOK!

161
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:23,333
HARRY BROUGHT ALL THESE
NICE PRESENTS JUST FOR ME!

162
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,200
- WELL, HOW NICE OF HIM.
VERY NICE.

163
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:29,400
- HE GAVE ME A GIFT, TOO.
A VERY EXPENSIVE NECKLACE.

164
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:32,633
I LOVE IT BUT I WON'T KEEP IT
UNLESS YOU WANT ME TO.

165
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,733
- NO, BY ALL MEANS KEEP IT.

166
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,666
LET HIM SEE HOW
MUCH YOU ENJOY IT.

167
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:38,366
- DEAR, YOU SURE?

168
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:41,233
- I HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR GIFTS
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

169
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,833
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH, HARRY.

170
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,666
- NO NEED TO RUSH OFF, HARRY.
PLEASE MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.

171
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,866
- I ALREADY HAVE.

172
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,566
- ( whispers ) HOW DID YOU
FIND OUT ABOUT THIS PLACE?

173
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:55,300
THE ORGANIZATION
HAS NO RECORD OF IT.

174
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:58,466
- IT'S A GIFT. I CAN FIND
OUT ANYTHING ABOUT ANYONE.

175
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:04,566
- VERY IMPRESSIVE, HARRY,
AS USUAL.

176
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:06,666
- DID YOU HAVE TO
INVOLVE HIS FAMILY?

177
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,466
- HE THREATENED OUR HARMONY.

178
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:11,366
I HAD TO GIVE HIM A
GOOD REASON NOT TO.

179
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:13,633
- HE GOT ONE.
- YES, I KNOW.

180
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,000
YOU NEEDN'T BOTHER WITH NORTON
AND KEITH. I'LL TALK TO THEM.

181
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:18,300
THAT ALL RIGHT?

182
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:20,766
- SURE. THAT'LL SAVE
ME A LOT OF TIME.

183
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,366
- ( door closes )

184
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:31,766
- AH, FINALLY. SO WHAT'S BEEN
GOING ON WITH THE RESEARCH, LEE?

185
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,633
- ACCORDING TO THE LAB REPORTS,
THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN COMPLETED.

186
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,033
HOWEVER, IN OUR ABSENCE

187
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,133
THE DOCTOR SEEMS TO HAVE
BECOME A BIT RELUCTANT

188
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,266
TO BEGIN TESTING
THE STARTUP PROGRAM.

189
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,800
- CONVINCE HIM.
- I WILL DO THAT.

190
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:45,700
- HE WORKED FOR SO MANY
YEARS AND COME SO FAR.

191
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:48,033
WHY WOULD HE HESITATE NOW?

192
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:56,800
- FINALLY I'VE DONE IT.
IT'S READY.

193
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,666
- THIS DEMON...

194
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,766
- HEY, BRO.
- SO, IS THE TARGET IN HIS ROOM?

195
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:30,966
- YEAH, WITH HIS FAMILY.

196
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:33,933
BUT NO PROBLEM, THE SURFCAM'S
IVR IS WORKING PERFECTLY.

197
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,566
- WE KNOW EVERY MOVE HE MAKES.

198
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:37,366
- SO, IF WE WAIT TILL
THE FAMILY LEAVES...

199
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:39,433
- WAIT?
WHAT THE HELL FOR?

200
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,800
- THE FAMILY.
BRANDON ALWAYS DID...

201
00:12:41,866 --> 00:12:44,333
- DON'T EVER LET ME HEAR THAT
TRAITOR'S NAME AGAIN.

202
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,966
- SORRY, BRO.
- HUH.

203
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:50,400
IT WAS BULLSHIT LIKE THAT,
ALL THAT SOFTHEARTED PANSY CRAP

204
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:53,400
THAT TWISTED HIM
INSIDE OUT AND GOT HIM KILLED.

205
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,066
- BRO...

206
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,833
- ( gunshots )

207
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,300
- Man: WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU...

208
00:13:06,366 --> 00:13:08,500
- Girl: DADDY!

209
00:13:08,566 --> 00:13:10,733
- ( woman screaming )

210
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,633
- ( footsteps approaching )

211
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,533
- THE KUGASHIRA GROUP.

212
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:28,133
WE'RE NOT TRUE GRAVE ANYMORE.

213
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,333
FROM NOW ON, WE'RE CALLED
THE KUGASHIRA GROUP, GOT IT?

214
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:36,933
- HARD TO BELIEVE IT'S BEEN
TWO MONTHS SINCE BRANDON DIED.

215
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,766
- YEAH, TIME SURE
FLIES FAST BOSS.

216
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,900
HOW DO YOU THINK THINGS ARE
GONNA BE IN THE ORGANIZATION

217
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:44,700
WITHOUT HAVING BIG DADDY AROUND?

218
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:45,933
- I DON'T KNOW.

219
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:50,900
- SOMEONE'S GOT
THERE BEFORE US.

220
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:02,433
- Maria: I SEE...

221
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,600
YOU SHOWED BRANDON
THE ROPES, SO TO SPEAK.

222
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,866
- JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

223
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:08,400
BACK WHEN HE WAS
AROUND 17 OR 18,

224
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:10,133
FOR MAYBE A YEAR OR SO.

225
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,433
- BUT EVEN AFTER HIS PROMOTION
HE'D DROP IN TO SEE US

226
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,866
AND WE'D HAVE A LOT OF FUN.

227
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:16,266
- THAT'S SO STRANGE.
- WHY IS THAT?

228
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,300
- HE DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO HAVE FUN.

229
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:19,766
HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO LAUGH.

230
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,433
- A SHY KID.
BUT AS SINCERE AS THEY COME.

231
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,200
- HE WAS A GOOD GUY.
I JUST WISH I KNEW

232
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:27,366
WHY HE BETRAYED THE
ORGANIZATION, YOU KNOW?

233
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,633
- ( gasps )

234
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,333
- HEY!
- UH-OH!

235
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:34,166
- BRANDON BROKE
THE CODE OF IRON?

236
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:37,933
- OH, NO. NOT EXACTLY.
YOU SEE, IT'S JUST A RUMOR.

237
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,233
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

238
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,766
I KNEW BRANDON.

239
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:44,533
AND I KNOW HE COULDN'T
HAVE DONE ANY SUCH THING.

240
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,166
- I WONDER...

241
00:14:50,033 --> 00:14:52,033
- IT'S ALL SET, HARRY.
WE'RE READY TO GO.

242
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,833
WE'LL START WITH THE
NECROLYZATION ACTIVATION SYSTEM.

243
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,633
- THIS TIME YOUR
BIG BROTHER'S DREAM

244
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,233
IS ACTUALLY GONNA COME TRUE.

245
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,166
- MY, WHAT TOUCHING
SENTIMENTALISM.

246
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,900
HARRY, LETS NOT WASTE TIME.

247
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:03,633
I'M FAR MORE
INTERESTED IN SEEING

248
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,866
THE NEW POWER OF
NECROLYZATION...

249
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:08,466
AND TO SEE EXACTLY
HOW HARRY MACDOWEL

250
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,633
PLANS TO USE THIS NEW POWER.

251
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,800
- TO CLIMB ALL THE WAY
TO THE TOP.

252
00:15:12,866 --> 00:15:14,166
- OF COURSE.

253
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,300
- STOP THE CAR.
- WE DON'T HAVE TIME, HARRY.

254
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:22,000
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

255
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:25,600
- ( whimpering )

256
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:31,000
- HOW YOU DOING, KIDDO?

257
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:34,000
THAT GUY HURT YOU,
DIDN'T HE?

258
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,566
WHAT HAPPENED?

259
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:39,233
- BROKE A DISH,
IN THE RESTAURANT.

260
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,166
AND THE MANAGER
GOT ANGRY AND HE...

261
00:15:43,466 --> 00:15:45,300
- YOU RESENT THAT, DON'T YOU?

262
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:48,366
YOU HATE HIM?

263
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:53,300
GOT YOU. WAIT HERE, OKAY?

264
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:02,800
- ( gunshots )

265
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,966
- ( gasps )

266
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:11,833
- ABRACADABRA.

267
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,866
YOUR WISH CAME TRUE, KID.

268
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,300
- WAKE UP!

269
00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:35,000
WAKE UP! WAKE UP! WAKE UP!

270
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:36,800
( sobs )

271
00:16:36,866 --> 00:16:39,566
- YOU'RE CRYING?
WHY, I THOUGHT YOU HATED HIM.

272
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:44,300
- DON'T DIE. PLEASE DON'T!

273
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,033
- ( sobbing )

274
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:02,766
- ( yells ) HE WAS THE
ONE WHO BETRAYED ME!

275
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,400
HOW COULD HE HAVE CHOSEN
THAN FEEBLE OLD FOOL OVER ME?

276
00:17:05,466 --> 00:17:07,700
THAT SON OF BITCH BETRAYED ME!

277
00:17:07,766 --> 00:17:09,333
HOW COULD I FORGIVE HIM?

278
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,033
THERE'S NO WAY I COULD
FORGIVE HIM!

279
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,300
YOU SEE, I HAD TO
KILL HIM MYSELF.

280
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,866
I WAS THE ONE HE BETRAYED.

281
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:19,100
( sobbing )

282
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:25,300
BRANDON...

283
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:31,266
- BOSS, IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

284
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,833
- WHAT HAPPENED?

285
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,866
- THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT
AT THE LAB.

286
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:38,566
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

287
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:40,933
- ( alarm bell ringing )

288
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:44,833
- ( screaming )

289
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,366
- ( coughing )

290
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,666
- ( screams )

291
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:25,233
- ( tires screeching )

292
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,300
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE?

293
00:18:30,366 --> 00:18:32,733
- THERE WAS SOME EQUIPMENT
DAMAGE AND THE NECROLYZATION

294
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,000
STARTED BEFORE WE COULD
ENTER THE CONTROL SYSTEM.

295
00:18:35,066 --> 00:18:37,100
- WE CAN'T STOP THEM.
- OH, DAMN.

296
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,366
- THOSE MONSTERS HAVE KILLED
HALF OUR GUYS, SIR.

297
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:40,433
THE DOCTOR TOO.

298
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,300
- IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO?

299
00:18:42,366 --> 00:18:44,700
- THEY USE RAW MATERIALS
FOR NECROLYZATION...

300
00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:47,000
IT'S GOING TO TAKE
AT LEAST 50 HOURS

301
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:48,966
UNTIL THEY FINALLY SHUT DOWN.

302
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:50,300
- WHAT THE HELL...

303
00:18:51,033 --> 00:18:52,833
- ( loud explosion )

304
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:00,366
- IT'S COMING STRAIGHT AT US.

305
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:02,333
- SO, THAT'S NECROLYZATION, HUH?

306
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,200
- A GUN LIKE THAT
WON'T EVEN SLOW HIM DOWN.

307
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:06,500
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE.
THERE'S NO CHOICE.

308
00:19:06,566 --> 00:19:09,266
- HE'S RIGHT, BOSS.
WE SHOULD LEAVE IMMEDIATELY.

309
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,300
- DAMN! COULD THIS
BE BRANDON'S CURSE?

310
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:20,166
- ( laughing maniacally )

311
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,333
- DARLING...

312
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,200
- MARIA, YOU'VE BEEN TO
BRANDON'S GRAVE AGAIN,

313
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:29,666
HAVEN'T YOU?

314
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:31,766
FROM NOW ON, WOULD YOU
PLEASE LET ME KNOW

315
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,566
WHEN YOUR GOING TO
LEAVE THE HOUSE?

316
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:37,000
YOU HAVE MORE THAN JUST
YOUR OWN SAFETY TO CONSIDER NOW.

317
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:40,400
- DARLING, I JUST HEARD SOMEONE
CALL BRANDON A TRAITOR.

318
00:19:40,466 --> 00:19:41,533
IS IT TRUE?

319
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,833
- WHO KILLED HIM?
WHO KILLED BRANDON?

320
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,400
YOU MUST KNOW WHO IT WAS.
PLEASE TELL ME.

321
00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:50,300
- I'VE GOT TO KNOW.
- IT'S BEST THAT YOU NOT KNOW.

322
00:19:50,366 --> 00:19:51,833
- PLEASE, TELL ME!

323
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:54,400
- ( sighs )

324
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:56,300
- VERY WELL. IT WAS...

325
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,066
IT WAS HARRY.

326
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:05,933
- ( gasps )

327
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,233
- HARRY KILLED BRANDON HEAT.

328
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,833
- ( panting )

329
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:21,833
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

330
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,166
HOW COULD IT HAVE GONE
SO OUT OF CONTROL?

331
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,100
MAYBE THIS IS WHAT I DESERVE FOR
MY SINS AGAINST GOD AND NATURE.

332
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,066
BUT...

333
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:52,700
IF THIS IS THE ONLY WAY
FOR ME TO ATONE FOR MY SINS

334
00:20:52,766 --> 00:20:54,433
THEN SO BE IT.

335
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:04,466
- ( machine whirring )

336
00:21:11,366 --> 00:21:13,833
- IT'S NOT SAFE TO STAY.
EVEN UP HERE.

337
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,233
COME ON BOSS. LET'S GET GOING.

338
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,600
- IT WILL BE MINE.

339
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,866
I'LL DO WHATEVER
I HAVE TO DO TO GET IT.

340
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:23,900
THE POWER I NEED.

341
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:26,466
THE POWER!

342
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,433
- ( gunshot )

343
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,000
- WHAT THE HELL?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

344
00:22:16,866 --> 00:22:18,300
- I'M SORRY.

345
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:37,133
- Brandon: IT WAS A
SPLIT SECOND ENCOUNTER

346
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,700
OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARIES
OF MY MEMORY.

347
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,233
- ( pop song playing )

348
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,466
- ( man singing )

349
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:18,933
- Brandon: DEAR BIG DADDY,
WHEN YOU READ THIS LETTER...

350
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,133
I WILL NO LONGER
EXIST IN YOUR WORLD.

351
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,233
BUT THAT WAS MY CHOICE.
I HAVE NO REGRETS.

352
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,833
NO REGRETS.
