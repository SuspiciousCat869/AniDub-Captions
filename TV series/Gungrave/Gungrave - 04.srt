1
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:12,633
( theme music playing )

2
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,700
- ( inaudible )

3
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,333
- ( church bell tolling )

4
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:52,600
- Brandon: MANY OF THOSE
WHO LOSE THEIR LIVES

5
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:55,333
LEAVE LOVED ONES BEHIND.

6
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,066
TODAY, AS USUAL,

7
00:01:58,133 --> 00:02:00,700
GRIEF-STRICKEN FAMILIES,
FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS

8
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:02,633
MOURN THE ONES THEY'VE LOST.

9
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,766
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS.
IT NEVER CHANGES.

10
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,866
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE HERE
IN THIS CITY

11
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:11,266
IS THAT IT HAPPENS
SO FREQUENTLY.

12
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,833
YEAH, IT'S THE ONLY DIFFERENCE.

13
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,133
- Harry: AREN'T YOU
GONNA GO SEE MARIA?

14
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,566
AREN'T YOU GONNA GO
TO THE FUNERAL?

15
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:28,666
BRANDON, YOU'RE NOT TO BLAME
FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

16
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:31,666
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT THAT
MARIA'S UNCLE WAS KILLED.

17
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:33,633
WE WERE FIGHTING WITH DEED.

18
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,766
HIS BROTHER HAPPENED TO BELONG
TO THE MAFIA.

19
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,300
KENNY'S GUN WAS JUST A TOY.

20
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:41,300
WE WERE NOTHING BUT
A COUPLE OF PUNKS.

21
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,533
THERE'S ARE INFINITE CAUSES.

22
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,100
THE FACT THAT WE SURVIVED
MIGHT JUST BE AN ACCIDENT.

23
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,466
- Brandon: THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG HERE.

24
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:03,500
SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T QUITE
MAKE SENSE.

25
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:05,600
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

26
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,000
THE UNSPEAKABLE SORROW

27
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:11,800
AND THE MADDENING FRUSTRATION
OF NOT KNOWING WHY IT HAPPENED

28
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:13,966
ARE ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
RIGHT NOW.

29
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:30,066
- Man 1: HEY, LOOK!

30
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,066
IT'S HARRY AND BRANDON!

31
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:35,366
Man 2: IS IT TRUE THEY'RE
THE ONES THAT KILLED DEED?

32
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:36,900
- Man 1: YEAH, I HEAR
SOME OF HIS GUYS

33
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,033
WERE THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED.

34
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,266
THEY WERE EYEWITNESSES.

35
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,633
- Man 2:
THERE'S A RUMOR GOING AROUND

36
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,300
THAT THEY KILLED
HIS BIG BROTHER TOO.

37
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:44,000
YOU KNOW, THAT MAFIA GUY?

38
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:44,800
- ( indistinct conversations )

39
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:46,500
BE REAL CAREFUL
AROUND THOSE TWO.

40
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:49,733
THEY'RE REAL ANGRY ABOUT
THEIR GUYS GETTIN' KILLED.

41
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:52,533
- Man 1: WHAT I HEARD
IS THEY WERE SET UP

42
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,700
BY SCOTT, THE SNITCH.

43
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,500
AND THAT THEY SETTLED
THE SCORE WITH HIM BIG TIME.

44
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:58,066
- Man 2: STAY AWAY
FROM THEM, GUYS.

45
00:03:58,133 --> 00:03:59,800
DON'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR THEM.

46
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:00,933
- Man 1: GOOD IDEA.

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
- RIGHT NOW, HARRY AND BRANDON
ARE EVEN MORE DANGEROUS

48
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:04,133
THAN THE MOB.

49
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,400
- SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO NOW, MARIA?

50
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,233
- JESTER PROBABLY HAD
NO SAVINGS TO SPEAK OF.

51
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,966
- I'LL QUIT SCHOOL
AND GO TO WORK.

52
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:21,200
- HERE IN THIS TOWN?

53
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:23,266
IT'D BE IMPOSSIBLE
FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU

54
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,400
TO LIVE HERE ON YOUR OWN.

55
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,400
- WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

56
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:29,866
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

57
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:31,100
( sobs )

58
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,766
BRANDON...

59
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:52,700
- Brandon: FOR SOME REASON,

60
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:54,966
EVER SINCE THAT DAY,

61
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:58,900
SEEMS LIKE THIS WHOLE
TOWN IS A LOT SMALLER.

62
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,033
I WONDER WHY.

63
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,300
I WONDER WHY.

64
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:49,066
- SEEMS KINDA RISKY, BEAR,

65
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:51,933
FOR MILLENION'S NUMBER 1
SWEEPER TO BE GETTING DRUNK

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,233
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.

67
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,200
WITHOUT ANY OF HIS
BODYGUARDS AROUND.

68
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:58,466
I HEARD ABOUT IT.

69
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:00,866
IT WASN'T TYPICAL
OF THE WAY YOU USUALLY WORK.

70
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:05,033
BEAR, YOU'RE A BRILLIANT
SWEEPER, THE BEST THERE IS.

71
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,600
AND WE ALL KNOW
THAT THERE IS NOT ONE AMONG US

72
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,633
MORE LOYAL THAN YOU ARE.

73
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,400
HOWEVER, YOU'RE A LITTLE
TOO MERCIFUL ON OCCASION.

74
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:16,266
EVEN TOWARD AN ENEMY'S
DISCARDED PAWN.

75
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,766
- NOT TRUE.

76
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,800
I WAS SIMPLY GETTING RID
OF THE GUY FOR BIG DADDY

77
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:23,133
BECAUSE HE KILLED
BIG DADDY'S FRIEND.

78
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,066
- HMM, THE FACT IS

79
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:27,166
HE'D HAVE BEEN
MORE HELPFUL TO US ALIVE.

80
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:29,066
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS

81
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:30,900
BEFORE HE DIED.

82
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:32,033
- NO WAY IN HELL.

83
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,300
THAT GUY WOULD
NEVER HAVE TALKED.

84
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,000
- EVEN WITH DRUGS?

85
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:38,566
- NOT A CHANCE.

86
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:39,933
- ALL RIGHT.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
FOR GET IT. WE'LL JUST
LEAVE IT AT THAT.

88
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:45,800
- YOU'VE COME ALL THIS WAY
JUST TO TELL ME THAT, RANDY?

89
00:06:45,866 --> 00:06:47,233
- NO, OF COURSE NOT.

90
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,566
THE REASON I'M HERE IS TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THE YOUNG LADY.

91
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:53,000
BIG DADDY TOLD ME HE'D
LIKE TO GET TOGETHER

92
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:54,566
WITH HER TOMORROW.

93
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:56,133
- IS THAT SO?

94
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,466
THANKS FOR
TAKING CARE OF HER.

95
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,300
- BY THE WAY,
HOW'S YOUR DAUGHTER?

96
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:07,833
HOW OLD IS SHE NOW, BEAR?

97
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,033
- SHE'S GONNA BE SEVEN
NEXT MONTH.

98
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,733
- NO DOUBT SHE'S THE APPLE
OF YOUR EYE.

99
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:18,266
- ( door closes )

100
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:26,033
- HARRY, THE WHOLE THING
REALLY STINKS, YOU KNOW.

101
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,333
- I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW SORRY
I AM FOR THE GUYS YOU LOST.

102
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,833
- ( chuckles ) YEAH,
THANKS A LOT.

103
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,833
COME ON, NOW,
DON'T BE LIKE THAT.

104
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,333
DEED'S BROTHER, MAD DOG,
BELONGED TO THE MAFIA.

105
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,333
YOU KNOW THAT.

106
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,933
EVEN I CAN'T TOUCH A GUY
WITH THAT MUCH CLOUD.

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,466
YOU UNDERSTAND, DON'T YOU?

108
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:42,900
- I UNDERSTAND.

109
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:44,933
- SO HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO WORK FOR ME?

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,900
LET ME TAKE YOU
UNDER MY WING FOR A WHILE.

111
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:49,900
IT'D BE PRETTY TOUGH
FOR JUST TWO OF YOU

112
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:51,966
TO GET BY IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

113
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:54,066
- ( laughs )

114
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:55,600
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME, RIGHT?

115
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:59,033
I WOULDN'T HAVE MUCH OF A FUTURE
WITH A BOSS WHO FREAKS OUT...

116
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,900
JUST 'CAUSE HE'S SCARED TO DEATH
OF THE MAFIA.

117
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:04,400
- WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE, YOU LITTLE BASTARD?

118
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:08,266
- SCUMBAG!

119
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:14,633
- MR. DESCARTES,

120
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,866
I COULDN'T HELP NOTICING

121
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:19,666
THAT THIS GUN IS RIGGED
WITH A HAIR TRIGGER.

122
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:23,300
- O-OKAY, FINE...
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

123
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,000
- GEE, THANKS.

124
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:33,133
- HE MADE A FOOL OUT OF ME.

125
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,666
THE BASTARD!
DAMN, DAMN, DAMN!

126
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:39,500
GET THE GUYS. TELL THEM TO
GET READY FOR SOME ACTION!

127
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:40,733
- RIGHT AWAY, BOSS.

128
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,066
- ARE WE GONNA KILL THEM?
- GOT THAT RIGHT.

129
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:44,533
THOSE TWO ARE OUT OF CONTROL.

130
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,066
THEY COULD SCREW UP
OUR ENTIRE OPERATION.

131
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:49,000
THEY'RE A COUPLE
OF LOOSE CANNONS.

132
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:51,433
AND THE SOONER
WE GET RID OF THEM, THE BETTER.

133
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:12,100
- HEY, BRANDON, I'M GETTING
OUT OF THIS DAMN TOWN.

134
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:15,866
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING.

135
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:18,166
AND THERE'S NO GUARANTEE
THAT THINGS WILL GO ANY BETTER

136
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:20,133
WHEN I GET THERE.

137
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,900
BUT I CAN'T
FLY FREE HERE...

138
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,900
I GOT NO ATTACHMENT,
NO REASON TO STAY.

139
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:31,400
BUT AS LONG AS MARIA IS HERE,

140
00:09:31,466 --> 00:09:32,666
YOU DO HAVE A REASON

141
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:35,100
'CAUSE YOU WANNA BE AS
CLOSE TO HER AS YOU CAN.

142
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,600
BUT I NEED TO CHANGE MY LIFE.

143
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,800
SO IF I HAVE TO GO ALONE,
THEN SO BE IT.

144
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,566
- HARRY...

145
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:47,533
- I KNOW I'M BEING SELFISH,
BUT YOU UNDERSTAND.

146
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,566
- I'LL GO TOO.

147
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,733
- HUH?

148
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:05,500
ARE YOU SURE?

149
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,000
- WE'RE PARTNERS, RIGHT?

150
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,000
- ( chuckles )

151
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:18,466
- WHAT WAS THAT?

152
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:22,100
- YOU THINK YOU'RE COOL, HUH?

153
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:26,866
- ( both laughing )

154
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:18,600
- MISS MARIA, I'M SORRY
I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU MY NAME YET.

155
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,266
FORGIVE MY RUDENESS.
MY NAME IS ASAGI.

156
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,366
YOUR UNCLE WAS ONE OF MY
OLDEST AND DEAREST FRIENDS.

157
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,900
BUT WE HADN'T SEEN ONE ANOTHER
FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS.

158
00:11:27,966 --> 00:11:30,633
THAT'S WHY IT TOOK ME SO LONG
TO LEARN HE PASSED AWAY.

159
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,700
I WOULD'VE COME SOONER.
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

160
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:34,833
- THERE'S NOTHING TO FORGIVE.

161
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,133
- TO ME JESTER
WAS IRREPLACEABLE,

162
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,533
WAS A VERY DEAR FRIEND INDEED.

163
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,733
IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO
ACCEPT THE FACT THAT HE'S DEAD.

164
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,766
OR TO BELIEVE
THAT HE'S GONE FOREVER.

165
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:47,633
- IF YOU WOULDN'T
MIND MY ASKING,

166
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,166
HOW DID YOU AND
MY UNCLE, JESTER,

167
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:50,800
KNOW EACH OTHER, MR. ASAGI?

168
00:11:50,866 --> 00:11:53,833
HE AND I WORKED FOR THE SAME
COMPANY. THAT'S WHERE WE MET.

169
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,533
FOR 15 YEARS WE WORKED
OUR FINGERS TO THE BONE,

170
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
BOTH STRIVING TO REACH
THE SAME GOAL.

171
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,600
MY DEAR MARIA,
WITHOUT HIS ASSISTANCE,

172
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,700
I WOULDN'T BE WHERE I AM TODAY.

173
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:05,266
I WAS NEVER ABLE TO
THANK HIM ENOUGH

174
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,566
FOR WHAT HE'S DONE FOR ME.

175
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:08,100
- HE WAS A GOOD MAN.

176
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,500
- ( laughs )

177
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:11,766
PARDON THE RAMBLINGS
OF AN OLD MAN.

178
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,033
HOW TERRIBLY BORING FOR YOU.

179
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,966
- NOT AT ALL.

180
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:19,033
- MISS MARIA, I CAME HERE
TODAY TO OFFER YOU

181
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,066
SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE

182
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:21,900
WOULD BE IN YOUR BEST INTEREST.

183
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,666
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO MOVE OUT OF THIS PLACE

184
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:27,400
AND LIVE IN MY MANSION?

185
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:28,766
- WHAT?

186
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:43,966
- I NOW THIS IS OUT OF THE BLUE,
OF COURSE YOU'RE SURPRISED.

187
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:47,333
BUT YOU SEE MY DEAR, YOUR UNCLE,
TO WHOM I OWE SO MUCH

188
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,900
WENT THROUGH A GREAT
DEAL OF TROUBLE

189
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:50,833
TO ADOPT YOU AND PROTECT YOU.

190
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,666
SO NOW, HIS WISHES
WILL BECOME MINE.

191
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,333
FOR HIS SAKE AS WELL
AS YOUR OWN.

192
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,733
- BUT HOW COULD YOU HAVE KNOWN?

193
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,200
- WE HAD SOMEONE IN OUR
COMPANY LOOK INTO IT.

194
00:13:02,266 --> 00:13:04,300
- FORGIVE US
FOR TAKING THE LIBERTY.

195
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,300
- OF COURSE.

196
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:09,866
- MISS MARIA, I THINK IT
IS FAR TOO DANGEROUS

197
00:13:09,933 --> 00:13:12,566
FOR YOU TO GO ON LIVING
HERE ON YOUR OWN.

198
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:15,333
- AT THE PRESIDENT'S MANSION,
YOU'D BE UNDER OUR PROTECTION.

199
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,000
AND WE'D HAVE EVERYTHING YOU
NEED, OF THAT I CAN ASSURE YOU.

200
00:13:18,066 --> 00:13:19,633
WHAT YOU HAVE
HERE IN COMPARISON

201
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,200
TO HOW YOU'D LIVE
AT THE MANSION,

202
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:23,933
WELL, THERE ISN'T VERY MUCH
TO THINK ABOUT, IS THERE?

203
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,433
- RANDY, PLEASE!

204
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,233
- I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN
TO BE RUDE TO YOU, MISS.

205
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:30,700
BUT SURELY, YOU CAN SEE

206
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:31,900
THAT LIVING AT THE MANSION

207
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:35,433
IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN
ENSURE YOUR SAFETY.

208
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,900
- YES, BUT...

209
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:38,800
- WHY DON'T YOU COME,
PAY ME A VISIT

210
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:40,566
AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE PLACE?

211
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:42,600
YOU CAN DECIDE AFTER THAT.

212
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,166
BUT ABOVE ALL,

213
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:47,233
PLEASE REMEMBER THAT FOR BOTH
YOUR UNCLE AND MYSELF,

214
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,933
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT
IS YOUR HAPPINESS.

215
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:51,700
THAT'S ALL.

216
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:57,966
MISS MARIA, I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
FOR ON FAVOR IF I MAY.

217
00:13:58,033 --> 00:14:00,600
I'D LIKE TO VISIT
YOUR UNCLE JESTER'S GRAVE

218
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,200
IF THAT WOULD BE
ALL RIGHT WITH YOU.

219
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,333
- YES, OF COURSE.
I'LL TAKE YOU THERE.

220
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,166
- I THANK YOU, MISS MARIA.

221
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:17,933
- SORRY, GUYS, BUT BRANDON AND
I WON'T BE AROUND FOR A WHILE.

222
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,866
DECIDED TO LEAVE TOWN.

223
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:22,566
BUT SOME DAY, WE'LL CLIMB THE
LADDER ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP

224
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:24,266
AND MAKE A WHOLE BUNCH OF MONEY.

225
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,966
AND THEN YOU CAN BET WE'LL MAKE
YOU GUYS THE BIGGEST GRAVES

226
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,266
THIS TOWN'S EVER SEEN.

227
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,766
BUT FOR NOW...

228
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,766
I HOPE YOU GUYS
WILL FORGIVE US.

229
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,000
- HEY, HARRY.
- HMM?

230
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,166
- JESTER, HUH?
GOOD OLD BRANDON.

231
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,100
ISN'T THAT MARIA?

232
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,333
- MARIA!

233
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,766
- ( gun shot fires )

234
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:32,433
- BRANDON!

235
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:47,566
- YOU KNOW THAT FELLOW?

236
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:49,500
- YES, I KNOW HIM.

237
00:15:49,566 --> 00:15:51,066
HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE.

238
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:53,900
BUT WHY, BRANDON...

239
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,833
WHAT'S GOING ON?

240
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,666
- MISS MARIA, DON'T WORRY. JUST
LET ME HANDLE THIS, ALL RIGHT?

241
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:08,966
PLEASE, JUST RELAX.
NEGOTIATION IS MY SPECIALTY.

242
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:10,533
THIS PLACE IS TOO DANGEROUS

243
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,166
SO YOU AND THE PRESIDENT
WILL BE GOING NOW.

244
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:16,166
THIS ISN'T EXACTLY
THE ORIGINAL PLAN

245
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:18,733
BUT AT LEAST YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO SEE WHAT THE MANSION IS LIKE.

246
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,933
- BUT, WHAT ABOUT BRANDON?

247
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,133
- YOU NEEDN'T WORRY.

248
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,366
TAKE THEM TO THE MANSION.

249
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:26,433
- YES, SIR.

250
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,300
- SURPRISING TURN OF EVENTS.

251
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,666
- EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE,
MISS MARIA.

252
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:46,633
MY SUBORDINATES
ARE QUITE CAPABLE, I ASSURE YOU.

253
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,566
- MARIA!

254
00:16:58,933 --> 00:17:00,433
- BRANDON!

255
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,666
- ( gun shot fires )

256
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,900
- DON'T MOVE.

257
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:14,766
HARRY, COME ON OUT!

258
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,766
OR YOUR PARTNER IS GONNA HAVE
A HOLE THROUGH HIS HEAD!

259
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,800
- RUN, HARRY!
- SHUT UP!

260
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,866
- BETTER HURRY, HARRY.

261
00:17:24,933 --> 00:17:27,166
MY TRIGGER FINGER'S
GETTING ITCHY.

262
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,633
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

263
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,766
- WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?
THERE HE IS.

264
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,100
- HARRY, WHY?

265
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,800
- HEY, IF YOU'RE GONNA GO,
I'M GOING, TOO.

266
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,066
WE'RE PARTNERS, RIGHT?

267
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,733
- RISKING YOUR LIFE FOR
YOUR BUDDY. HOW TOUCHY.

268
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,300
- IN THAT CASE, WE'LL SEND THEM
TO HELL TOGETHER.

269
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,900
- ( gun shots firing )

270
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:58,666
- HEY, WHAT THE HELL?

271
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:00,100
- HOW DARE YOU DO THAT HERE,

272
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,766
A PLACE OF REVERENCE
AND RESPECT?

273
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,633
- WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT,
OLD MAN?

274
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,233
- DON'T GO STICKING YOUR NOSE
INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS.

275
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,600
- ( guns cocking )

276
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,133
- MY BOSS' OLDEST FRIEND IS
LAID TO REST IN THIS CEMETERY.

277
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,133
IF YOU TRY TO CONTINUE
THIS NONSENSE,

278
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,600
I'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO
PUT A STOP TO IT, UNDERSTAND?

279
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,566
EVEN IF YOU ARE JUST
YOUNG, SPINELESS PUNKS.

280
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,866
- ARE YOU PLANNING
TO DEFY THE ORGANIZATION?

281
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:35,966
ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE?

282
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,900
JUST USE YOUR IMAGINATION.

283
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:41,366
FIRST, I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE

284
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:43,300
WHAT WE WOULD DO
TO YOUR FAMILIES.

285
00:18:43,366 --> 00:18:45,433
AND AFTER THAT,
EVERYONE ELSE YOU CARE ABOUT.

286
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,266
YOUR CLOSEST FRIENDS,
YOUR NEIGHBORS.

287
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:51,000
- MAFIA?

288
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:53,400
- GOT IT ON THE FIRST TRY.
GOOD FOR YOU.

289
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,200
- PLEASE DON'T KILL ME.

290
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,166
- KILL YOU?

291
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:58,666
NOW, WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

292
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:01,600
WHAT WOULD I HAVE TO GAIN
FROM KILLING YOU GUYS?

293
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,333
SO, YOU RUN ALONG HOME NOW.

294
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,600
LISTEN TO YOUR PARENTS,

295
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,833
DO AS YOU'RE TOLD AND
FOLLOW THE RULES.

296
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,833
LEARN TO TREAT OTHERS DECENTLY.

297
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,000
AND HOW TO BE A PRODUCTIVE
MEMBER OF OUR SOCIETY.

298
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:16,700
- ( stuttering ) THAT MEANS
I CAN GO NOW?

299
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:19,133
- LIFE IS A TREASURE.
REMEMBER THAT.

300
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,966
- RIGHT. I WILL, SIR.

301
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:22,666
- ( all screaming )

302
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:27,600
- THAT WAS A CLOSE CALL, EH?
- YEAH.

303
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,900
- IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU GUYS,
WE WOULD'VE BEEN GONNERS.

304
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:31,266
THANKS A LOT.

305
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,533
YOU GUYS ARE WITH
THE MILLENNION, AREN'T YOU?

306
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,133
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

307
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,100
YOUR KEEN INSIGHT
COULD BE USEFUL

308
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,633
IF YOU LEARN HOW TO USE IT.

309
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,866
TELL ME, WHAT MADE YOU
DECIDE TO RECUSE US?

310
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:44,366
YOU'RE ALIVE,
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW.

311
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,600
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US...

312
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,300
IS THERE ANY WAY FOR ME
TO JOIN YOUR ORGANIZATION?

313
00:19:49,366 --> 00:19:51,200
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE NOT
CUT OUT FOR THAT.

314
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:52,500
BUT I WANT TO JOIN!

315
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,800
- HARRY...

316
00:19:54,866 --> 00:19:58,900
- I'M SORRY, BRANDON. MY
DESTINATION'S JUST BEEN CHANGED.

317
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:00,666
THE WAY THINGS ARE,
IF I DON'T DO THIS,

318
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,900
I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO GET WHAT I REALLY WANT.

319
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:05,066
LOOK, I KNOW
IT SOUNDS CRAZY BUT...

320
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:06,566
- YOU'RE VERY SELFISH.

321
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:10,100
WHAT I WANT IS TO PROVE
MY USEFULNESS.

322
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,133
I'LL FIND THOSE GUYS
THAT ATTACKED US,

323
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,933
AND PAY 'EM BACK ALONG WITH
THEIR BOSS, DESCARTES,

324
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,200
THE MOST POWERFUL GUY
IN TOWN.

325
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:19,000
PLEASE, SAY YOU'LL LET ME
JOIN, SIR.

326
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:23,366
- YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO LEARN
SO LISTEN CLOSELY.

327
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:26,066
THE MAFIA'S PHILOSOPHY
IS THAT KILLING IS FORBIDDEN

328
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:28,700
UNLESS IT SERVES
THE ORGANIZATION.

329
00:20:28,766 --> 00:20:32,400
YOU SAID YOUR ENEMY IS THE
MOST POWERFUL MAN IN TOWN.

330
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:34,933
SO DON'T KILL HIM,
SQUEEZE HIM.

331
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,966
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET
ANYTHING FROM A DEAD MAN.

332
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:39,933
FURTHERMORE, THE FACT
THAT HE TRIED TO KILL YOU

333
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,833
CAN BE USED TO JUSTIFY
THE SQUEEZE.

334
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,200
HE'S THE PERFECT TARGET.

335
00:20:43,266 --> 00:20:46,966
SQUEEZE HIM AND THEN DEMAND
GREATER PRODUCTIVITY.

336
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:49,733
CONTROL HIM WITHOUT HIS KNOWING
WHO'S IN CONTROL.

337
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,366
POWER WHEN USED PROPERLY
IS INVISIBLE.

338
00:20:53,433 --> 00:20:55,666
JUST GIVE ME TWO HOURS
AND I'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN.

339
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,933
- ( shivering )

340
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,300
- SO THIS IS THE WAY TO
USE POWER, MILLENNION STYLE.

341
00:21:27,133 --> 00:21:29,733
SORRY I MADE YOU
TAG ALONG, BRANDON.

342
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,166
SO, CAN I...

343
00:21:43,233 --> 00:21:45,300
- IF YOU'RE SERIOUS,
GET IN THE CAR.

344
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,833
- I'LL BE SEEING YOU, BRANDON.

345
00:22:04,433 --> 00:22:05,766
BRANDON? YOU...

346
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,233
GREAT!

347
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:21,033
- Brandon: HARRY, MY ONE
AND ONLY PARTNER.

348
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:23,866
I WANTED US TO BE TOGETHER.

349
00:22:24,766 --> 00:22:26,733
THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING.

350
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,900
BUT WHAT I WAS FEELING...

351
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,666
IS THAT WHEN WE REACHED
OUR DESTINATION,

352
00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:34,400
I'D FIND MARIA.

353
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:36,633
FIND HER FOR SURE.

354
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,733
I HAD SUCH A STRANGE CONVICTION.

355
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:47,266
- ( pop song playing )

356
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,800
- ( man singing )

357
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,433
- Brandon: MILLENNION.

358
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,433
THE LARGEST CRIMINAL
ORGANIZATION IN THE CITY.

359
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,666
HERE, I CAN'T LIVE
LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE.

360
00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:23,833
BUT I'VE STILL GOT TO FIND
A WAY TO SURVIVE

361
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,933
BECAUSE MY FRIEND,
MY DEAREST FRIEND IS HERE TOO.
