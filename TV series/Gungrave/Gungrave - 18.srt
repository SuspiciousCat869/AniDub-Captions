1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,966
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:48,066
- ( gunfire )

3
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:49,566
- ( beeps )

4
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:51,800
- ( snarling )

5
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:13,500
- ( both gasp )
- ( shrieks )

6
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:26,566
- SO, GRAVE, YOU'RE NOT
FULLY MOBILE YET, ARE YOU?

7
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,466
- ( shrieks )

8
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:49,833
- HIS NAME WAS BRANDON.

9
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:54,566
BRANDON HEAT.

10
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:10,766
( Mika shouts )

11
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:18,933
BRANDON!  BRANDON!

12
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,200
- ( grunts )

13
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:38,100
- ( shrieks )

14
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,966
- AMAZING.

15
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:42,200
- ( snarling )

16
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:44,433
- ( shrieks )

17
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,833
- SORRY I'M LATE.

18
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,266
- LET'S CUT STRAIGHT
TO THE CHASE, SHALL WE?

19
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,033
ACCORDING TO THE REPORT
WE RECEIVED,

20
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,566
THE ORGMEN WE SENT OUT
WERE DESTROYED.  IS THIS TRUE?

21
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:00,933
- IT'S TRUE ALL RIGHT.

22
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
THERE'S NO SURVIVORS,
AND THERE'S NO WITNESSES.

23
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:04,966
HE EITHER--

24
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:07,300
THEY WERE COMPLETELY
ANNIHILATED.

25
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:10,533
- AND THOSE WERE THE SOLDIERS
YOU WERE BRAGGING ABOUT?

26
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,966
- YOU ARE INTIMATELY FAMILIAR
WITH THE EXTENT

27
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:14,266
OF THEIR ABILITIES.

28
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,400
SO THE ISSUE THAT
CONFRONTS US NOW

29
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:18,966
IS WHO COULD POSSIBLY
BE POWERFUL ENOUGH

30
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:20,466
TO WIPE OUT SO MANY ORGMEN.

31
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:22,633
- COULD SUCH A HUMAN BEING
REALLY EXIST?

32
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,866
- WHO SAID IT HAD
TO BE A HUMAN?

33
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:27,766
BESIDES, THERE'S A SINGLE CASE
ON RECORD, ISN'T THERE?

34
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,100
AND I BELIEVE
IT DESCRIBES SOMEONE

35
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,700
WHO COULD ANNIHILATE
PROTOTYPE ORGMEN.

36
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:36,033
- THAT'S TRUE, BUT DIDN'T
THAT HAPPEN 13 YEARS AGO?

37
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,333
- THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S THE SAME AS 13 YEARS AGO.

38
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
- HUH?

39
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:42,400
- THERE IS A CROWD OF SORTS.

40
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:44,333
THE TYPE OF CROWD

41
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,966
WHO WOULD RISE AGAINST US.

42
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:49,033
WHAT WOULD WE DO THEN?
WELL, THAT'S OBVIOUS.

43
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,666
DESTROY THEM,
CRUSH THEM WITH THE POWER

44
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:54,366
OF THE MILLENNION ORGANIZATION.

45
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:56,333
EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM.

46
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,066
- BOSS, WHEN YOU FIND THE SPY,

47
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:02,666
LET ME KNOW.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

48
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:05,300
- THE MEETING SEEMS
TO BE OVER.

49
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:08,266
- HEY, LEE,
WE SHOULD GET GOING, TOO.

50
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,500
- SURE.

51
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,400
BOSS, I FOUND THIS
AT THE MANSION

52
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:20,533
THAT I VISITED THE OTHER DAY.

53
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,400
- HMM?

54
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,400
HMM.

55
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:27,333
- IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

56
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:34,866
- ( laughing )

57
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,166
- Man: BRANDON HEAT.

58
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:49,666
WE MEET AGAIN, BRANDON.

59
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:53,533
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT YOU
IN QUITE SOME TIME.

60
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,100
( laughing )

61
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:07,633
- Mika: MY MOTHER TOLD ME
ABOUT HIM ONCE.

62
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,200
THAT MAN, BRANDON HEAT,

63
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:12,900
HE WAS AN OLD FRIEND
OF HERS.

64
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:16,000
- I KNOW NOTHING AT ALL
ABOUT THAT MAN'S PAST.

65
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:18,400
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
HE WAS A GREAT SWEEPER.

66
00:07:18,466 --> 00:07:20,100
- HE WAS?

67
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,966
- AND NOW I HAVE TO GO OUT
AND PICK UP SOME EQUIPMENT.

68
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:29,000
I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU
STAYED HERE AND KEPT QUIET.

69
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:32,800
ONE MORE THING.
HE'S NOT CALLED BRANDON.

70
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:35,633
THAT NAME NO LONGER
BELONGS TO HIM.

71
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,400
HE'S CALLED "GRAVE."

72
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:40,366
CALL HIM "BEYOND THE GRAVE."

73
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:42,533
- HIS NAME IS

74
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,500
BEYOND THE GRAVE?

75
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,666
I KNOW YOU.

76
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,000
YOU'RE AN OLD FRIEND
OF MY MOTHER'S.

77
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:52,666
I'M SURE YOU'D LIKE
TO SEE HER AGAIN

78
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:55,733
AND TALK TO HER,
BUT YOU CAN'T.

79
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,500
YOU SEE, MY MOTHER IS NOT

80
00:07:57,566 --> 00:08:00,000
IN THIS WORLD ANYMORE.

81
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:02,900
SHE WAS KILLED AND TOKIOKA

82
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:04,833
WHO TRIED TO PROTECT ME

83
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,100
DIED SHIELDING ME
WITH HIS BODY.

84
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:11,333
THE ONE WHO KILLED 
THEM ALL WAS HARRY.

85
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,900
IT WAS HARRY MACDOWEL.

86
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:16,666
HE'S MILLENNION'S BOSS.

87
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:18,400
HE'S KNOWN AS BLOODY HARRY.

88
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:21,733
MY MOM WAS KILLED

89
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,633
BY HARRY.
- HARRY.

90
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,700
WHERE AM I?

91
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,666
WHO AM I?

92
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:15,066
- GUESS I NEED TO GET
SOME MORE BULLETS SOMEWHERE.

93
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,900
UM, EXCUSE ME.

94
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:25,066
ARE YOU FEELING OKAY?

95
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,866
- FROM THE LOOK OF THAT SUIT,

96
00:09:29,933 --> 00:09:32,866
YOU MUST BE DOING PRETTY WELL
FOR YOURSELF.

97
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:35,333
MAYBE THEY CAN HIRE ME, TOO.

98
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,866
- IS THIS--

99
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:39,933
AM I DREAMING?

100
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,700
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?

101
00:09:43,766 --> 00:09:46,133
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S WRONG?

102
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,166
- Man:
JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE.

103
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:51,166
- BUT--

104
00:10:04,766 --> 00:10:06,733
- IF HE HAD STAYED ASLEEP,

105
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,300
NOTHING WOULD HAVE CHANGED.

106
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:11,333
ONCE AWOKEN, HOWEVER,
HIS MIND WILL BE CONTROLLED

107
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,033
BY SOMETHING CALLED
THE PAST,

108
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,166
WHETHER HE LIKES
IT OR NOT.

109
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:33,966
- ( Mika whimpering )

110
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:40,000
ENOUGH ALREADY.

111
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:43,000
WHERE IN THE WORLD
IS THIS GUY GOING ANYWAY?

112
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:45,666
COME ON, I'M INJURED
JUST IN CASE YOU CARE.

113
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,066
- ( groaning )

114
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:22,333
( grunting )

115
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,100
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

116
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,733
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

117
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,300
- Man: STILL WORKING OUT, HUH?

118
00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:33,500
- Brandon: I KNOW.
- SAME OLD BRANDON. COME ON IN.

119
00:11:33,566 --> 00:11:35,200
I GOT SOME JUICY STUFF
TO TELL YOU.

120
00:11:35,266 --> 00:11:37,066
- Brandon: I KNOW THEM.
- YOU'RE GONNA GIVE IT TO MARIA,

121
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:38,933
IS THAT IT?
- Brandon: COMRADES.

122
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,433
- BRANDON.
- Brandon: AS FOR ME,

123
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
I'M COUNTING ON BRANDON.
- THEY'RE MY COMRADES.

124
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:44,433
- HEY, BRANDON.

125
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,000
- MY...
- BRANDON.

126
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:48,300
- FREE BRANDON.
- Brandon: THAT'S RIGHT.

127
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:50,833
- I WANNA BE FREE
TO TAKE WHAT I WANT

128
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,833
AND GIVE WHAT I WANT.
- MY NAME IS BRANDON HEAT.

129
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,233
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- ( groaning )

130
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,700
THIS IS WHERE

131
00:12:06,766 --> 00:12:08,733
I USED TO BE.

132
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:23,833
- ARE THESE ALL GRAVES?

133
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,700
IS SOMEONE YOU KNOW...

134
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,800
WELL, I GUESS THOSE PEOPLE MUST
HAVE BEEN DEAR TO YOU.

135
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:48,500
Mika:
I AM SUCH AN IDIOT.

136
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:52,166
AFTER THE ORGANIZATION
TOOK MY MOM AWAY FROM ME,

137
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:54,766
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS
GETTING BACK AT BLOODY HARRY

138
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,266
FOR KILLING HER.

139
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,033
I FORGOT ABOUT BURYING HER.

140
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,066
MY OWN MOTHER.
( crying )

141
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,133
I'M SO SORRY.

142
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,466
NO, THAT'S WAY TOO BIG.

143
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:35,566
- ( shouts )
- ( gasps )

144
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:43,633
WHAT IS THAT?

145
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,900
- Brandon:
WHAT IS IT?  WHO IS IT?

146
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:06,866
WHO ARE THEY?

147
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:10,200
- ( screams )
- WHY DO I PROTECT?

148
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,766
PROTECT?

149
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,233
PROTECT?

150
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:27,333
Brandon:
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

151
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:32,000
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

152
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:35,866
BUT THERE'S ONE THING
I KNOW FOR SURE.

153
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:40,166
TO PROTECT IS NOT
TO BETRAY.

154
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:43,600
NEVER BETRAY.  NEVER.

155
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,266
- ( snarls )
- ( men gasp )

156
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,300
- HMM.

157
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:28,000
- ( growling )

158
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:45,600
- GRAVE!
- ( roars )

159
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,333
( growls )
- OH!

160
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,933
- ( roaring )

161
00:16:13,366 --> 00:16:15,266
- WELL, GRAVE, GONNA FIGHT?

162
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,633
- ( growls )

163
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:52,100
- ( both scream )
- ( gasps )

164
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,600
- ( groans )

165
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:03,233
- ( roaring )

166
00:17:08,566 --> 00:17:09,466
- ( gasps )

167
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,233
MY MOM WAS KILLED

168
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,933
BY HARRY.

169
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,233
- Brandon:
SHE WAS MURDERED.

170
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,700
MARIA!

171
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,266
- ( growls )

172
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:58,700
- ( wincing )

173
00:18:02,433 --> 00:18:04,900
- DOCTOR,
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HIM?

174
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:07,600
WHAT'S CAUSING GRAVE
TO SUFFER LIKE THAT?

175
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,466
- HE'S PROBABLY TRYING
TO FORCE HIMSELF TO REMEMBER.

176
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:13,200
- WHY IS REMEMBERING
SO HARD FOR HIM?

177
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:16,233
- BECAUSE HE DIED ONCE.
- HUH?

178
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,666
- REANIMATION AFTER DEATH
CAUSES MEMORY FRAGMENTATION,

179
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:23,200
A CONDITION IN WHICH MEMORIES
HAVE EITHER VANISHED ENTIRELY

180
00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:25,833
OR HAVE BEEN BROKEN INTO PIECES
THAT MUST BE FIT TOGETHER

181
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,600
LIKE A JIGSAW PUZZLE.

182
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,433
HE'S TRYING TO BRING BACK
HIS PAST

183
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,466
FROM HIS FRAGMENTED MEMORIES.

184
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:34,833
- PLEASE, ISN'T THERE
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO FOR HIM?

185
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,066
- NOTHING, I'M AFRAID.
NOTHING AT ALL.

186
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:40,666
- OH, MAN.
- HOWEVER, I CAN TELL YOU THIS,

187
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:43,766
- OH!
- I'M NOT SURE WHY,

188
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,500
BUT EVIDENTLY YOU MEAN
A GREAT DEAL TO HIM.

189
00:18:46,566 --> 00:18:49,400
TWICE NOW BEYOND THE GRAVE
HAS MADE EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS

190
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:50,833
TO PROTECT YOU,

191
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,033
WHICH MEANS THERE MUST BE
A CONNECTION BETWEEN YOU

192
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,066
AND WHATEVER IT IS HE'S
STRUGGLING WITH WITHIN HIMSELF.

193
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:58,266
- ( sighs )

194
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:01,800
GRAVE IS PROTECTING ME.

195
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:03,866
- MIKE, YOU'VE GOT TO GO
RIGHT NOW.

196
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:06,233
FIND A PLACE WHERE THE
ORGANIZATION CAN'T REACH YOU.

197
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,800
- ORGANIZATION?
WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO GO?

198
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:12,500
- WHEREVER HE IS.
WHEREVER HE IS, MIKA.

199
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:14,000
- DON'T WORRY, MISS.

200
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:15,833
I KNOW A MAN
WHO CAN PROTECT YOU,

201
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,600
AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS
THAT I KNOW WHERE TO FIND HIM.

202
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,366
- PROTECT ME?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

203
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:23,366
YOU'RE GOING TO MEET A MAN
NAMED BRANDON HEAT.

204
00:19:23,433 --> 00:19:26,400
- BRANDON HEAT.

205
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,766
HE DIED AND CAME BACK
FROM THE DEAD.

206
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,866
HE'S...

207
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:36,366
BEYOND THE GRAVE.

208
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:39,433
- Harry:
WHAT?  SHE GOT AWAY?

209
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,966
WHERE WAS THE DEATH SQUAD?

210
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:45,400
WE ADDED ORGMEN TO THE SQUAD
SO THEY'D BE FULLY PREPARED,

211
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:46,600
DIDN'T WE?

212
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,533
- Man: It seems the girl
had a bodyguard.

213
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,800
- WHAT KIND OF BODYGUARD?

214
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:53,733
- I went ahead
and forwarded you the data

215
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,233
that Bob has been able
to extract from the memory

216
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,866
of the fallen orgman.

217
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:02,600
Boss, you better
get ready for this.

218
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,733
What Bob found

219
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,766
is very surprising.

220
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,733
- ( gasping )

221
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,200
( laughing )

222
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,900
I SEE.

223
00:20:25,966 --> 00:20:29,366
SO YOU ARE ALIVE,
BRANDON.

224
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:31,666
ARE YOU GOING TO BETRAY ME

225
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:34,866
ONCE AGAIN, BRANDON?

226
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:38,866
- BRANDON HEAT, YOU SAY?
- CORRECT.

227
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:41,500
HE WAS SEEN IN THE COMPANY
OF BIG DADDY'S DAUGHTER.

228
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:44,633
HE'S STRONG ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND
A DIRECT ATTACK BY THE ORGMEN,

229
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,600
AND EQUIPPED WITH ENOUGH
FIREPOWER TO DESTROY THEM.

230
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,666
- HE CAN'T BE ALIVE.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

231
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:52,766
- THE BOSS KILLED HIM.
- KUGASHIRA'S RIGHT.

232
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,300
THIRTEEN YEARS AGO
I SAW BRANDON'S CORPSE

233
00:20:55,366 --> 00:20:57,433
WITH MY OWN EYES.
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

234
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,733
BRANDON DID DIE 13 YEARS AGO.
HOWEVER--

235
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,100
- YOU'RE SAYING BRANDON
WAS NECROLIZED?

236
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:08,200
- YES, IF BRANDON HEAT WAS
NECROLIZED 13 YEARS AGO,

237
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:09,966
THEN EVERYTHING ELSE
FALLS INTO PLACE.

238
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:12,600
I BELIEVE IT'S THE ONLY
LOGICAL CONCLUSION.

239
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,833
IT WOULD EXPLAIN HIS ABILITY
TO DESTROY THE ORGMEN.

240
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,333
- UNDERSTOOD.
I'LL TAKE HIM OUT.

241
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,866
- HOLD ON, KUGASHIRA.
- WHY?

242
00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:22,933
HE BETRAYED THE ORGANIZATION,
DIDN'T HE?

243
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,700
AND TRAITORS DESERVE ONLY THING
AND THAT'S DEATH.

244
00:21:26,766 --> 00:21:30,200
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.  THAT'S
MILLENNION'S CODE OF IRON.

245
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:32,266
- BUT BRANDON HEAT'S
BEEN NECROLIZED.

246
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,233
- SO WHAT?
- WAIT A SEC, BUNJI.

247
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,366
IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU,
I'LL TAKE THE GUY OUT.

248
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:39,766
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
- BOB.

249
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,733
- FIGHTING AN OPPONENT LIKE THAT
WOULD BE THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

250
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,433
TO TRY OUT MY NEW POWERS
AS A SUPERIOR.

251
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,066
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

252
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:50,666
THE TRAITOR BRANDON HEAT
WILL BE EXECUTED

253
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:52,800
BY YOURS TRULY,

254
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:55,866
BOB POUNDMAX! ( laughing )

255
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,433
- GO ON FIGHTING.

256
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,366
THERE'S NO OTHER CHOICE,
IS THERE?

257
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:08,166
I HAVE TO KEEP FIGHTING
TO SURVIVE

258
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:10,366
AND TO TAKE REVENGE
ON MY MOTHER'S DEATH.

259
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:14,100
- YES, YOU'RE RIGHT, AND I'M
GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN DO

260
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,000
TO HELP YOU.

261
00:22:16,066 --> 00:22:18,566
I KNOW OF NO OTHER WAY
OF ATONING FOR WHAT I'VE DONE.

262
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:21,366
FOR HAVING ONCE SOLD MY SOUL
TO SATAN

263
00:22:21,433 --> 00:22:24,333
AND FOR SELLING HIS AS WELL.

264
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:29,866
- I WAS TRYING
TO BRING BACK MY PAST.

265
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:32,466
BEWILDERED
BY DISJOINTED MEMORIES,

266
00:22:32,533 --> 00:22:35,700
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING FROM
THAT PAST I HAVE TO PROTECT.

267
00:22:35,766 --> 00:22:37,800
SOMETHING I CAN'T BETRAY.

268
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:41,866
THERE MUST BE,

269
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:43,733
I KNOW THERE IS.

270
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,033
- ( theme music playing )

271
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:59,566
- ( singing in Japanese )

272
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,800
- Brandon: A MAN IS REUNITED
WITH HIS BEST FRIEND.

273
00:24:17,866 --> 00:24:21,266
BUT THERE'S A PROFOUND
DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THEM.

274
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:24,066
BECAUSE FOR THEM,
EVEN LIFE AND DEATH ITSELF

275
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:25,866
MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS.

276
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:28,566
A CHASM REMAINS
BETWEEN THEM.
