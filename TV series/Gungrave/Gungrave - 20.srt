1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,866
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:47,533
- ( screaming )

3
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,366
- ( glass shattering )

4
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:52,366
- MR. LEE, PLEASE,
 TRY TO CALM DOWN!

5
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:54,833
- MR. LEE!

6
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,166
- ( screams )

7
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:02,666
( yells )

8
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:07,733
- LEE, THAT'S QUITE
ENOUGH OF THAT NOW.

9
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,000
- YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
BEAR WALKEN,

10
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:17,333
BUT BOB POUNDMAX
IS NEVER EVER COMING BACK,

11
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,833
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

12
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,466
THAT TRAITOR.

13
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:22,133
HE KILLED MY BEST FRIEND

14
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,766
LIKE SOME KIND OF BARBARIAN.

15
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,133
- I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

16
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,600
WE'RE TRYING TO LOCATE HIM.

17
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,266
THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION'S
INVOLVED IN THE SEARCH.

18
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,266
- IF YOU DO HAPPEN
TO TRACK HIM DOWN,

19
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:35,133
I REQUEST THAT YOU DON'T
LET ANYONE LAY A HAND ON HIM.

20
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,700
BECAUSE I WANT TO
EXECUTE HIM MYSELF.

21
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,233
I'LL CUT HIM INTO LITTLE PIECES,
LEAVING NOTHING BEHIND.

22
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:56,500
- ( exhales )

23
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:09,800
- ( gunshot )

24
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,200
- ( inaudible )

25
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:34,533
- Mika: UM, EXCUSE ME?

26
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,966
YOU KNEW MY MOM WHEN
SHE WAS YOUNG, DIDN'T YOU?

27
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:39,633
SO TELL ME, WHAT WAS MOM LIKE
WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER?

28
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,200
WAS SHE REAL NICE?

29
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:42,533
WAS SHE PRETTY?

30
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,533
I BET SHE WAS REALLY BEAUTIFUL,
WASN'T SHE?

31
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,900
AND I'M GUESSING THAT
SHE WAS ALSO PRETTY POPULAR

32
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:50,900
BECAUSE SHE WAS SO CUTE.
AM I RIGHT?

33
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:52,600
I ASSUME THAT
SHE PROBABLY HAD

34
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,500
QUITE A FEW BOYFRIENDS AS WELL.

35
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:57,233
YOU AND MY MOM WERE CLOSE,
WEREN'T YOU?

36
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,200
WOULD YOU PLEASE
TELL ME ABOUT HER?

37
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,266
HEY, YOU!

38
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,766
- HUH?

39
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,433
- WERE YOU EVEN LISTENING
TO ANYTHING I WAS SAYING?

40
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:15,100
YOU KNOW, YOU BOYS REALLY
NEED TO PAY CLOSER ATTENTION

41
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,566
TO THE THINGS
THAT A GIRL SAYS.

42
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:20,933
OH, JEEZ. YOU'RE ALWAYS
SO QUIET LIKE THIS.

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,400
IF YOU NEVER SAY ANYTHING,

44
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:24,600
YOU WON'T EVER GET
THE GIRLS TO LIKE YOU.

45
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,500
SERIOUSLY.

46
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,700
IT WOULDN'T HURT YOU
TO TALK TO ME FOR A LITTLE BIT,

47
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:30,033
NOW WOULD IT?

48
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,533
IT FEELS SO SILLY
SITTING HERE TALKING TO MYSELF.

49
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,933
BUT WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,433
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, GRAVE?

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,766
IS THIS YOUNG LADY
GIVING YOU A HARD TIME AGAIN?

52
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,266
- WHAT'S THAT?

53
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,733
- JUST NOW,

54
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,266
I WENT UP TO THE ROOF
AND TOOK A LOOK OUTSIDE,

55
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,766
AND I SAW QUITE A FEW
MILLENNION AGENTS.

56
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,800
YOU KILLED ONE OF THE BIG FOUR
OF THE ORGANIZATION.

57
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:56,300
IN RETURN, IT'S ONLY NATURAL
FOR THEM TO HEAT THINGS UP. 

58
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:58,133
IN ANY CASE,

59
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,300
ROUND ONE IS PRETTY MUCH OVER.

60
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,300
HOW ARE YOU DOING, MISS?

61
00:05:02,366 --> 00:05:03,800
ARE YOU FEELING OKAY?

62
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:05,600
- ( sighs )

63
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:10,466
- IF YOU THINK THIS
IS ALL MEANINGLESS,

64
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:12,300
I SUGGEST THAT
YOU QUIT NOW. 

65
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:15,633
OTHERWISE, YOU'LL REGRET IT
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, 

66
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,766
JUST LIKE I DO.

67
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:20,633
- TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

68
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,633
I DON'T WANT TO
SEE ANYONE DIE.

69
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,966
BUT, YOU KNOW,

70
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,000
EVEN SO,

71
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:28,766
I STILL...

72
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,866
- HMM?
- ( gasps )

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,633
- ( laughs )

74
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,266
REGARDLESS OF HOW
YOU FEEL ABOUT IT, MISS,

75
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,200
IT LOOKS LIKE THIS MAN
IS DETERMINED

76
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:46,833
TO CUT YOU A PATH
THROUGH ALL THOSE BATTLES.

77
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,066
- I WANT YOU TO MAKE
AN ANNOUNCEMENT

78
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,666
THAT BOB POUNDMAX'S DEATH
WAS DUE TO A BLOOD CLOT

79
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:57,633
FROM HIGH CHOLESTEROL LEVELS.

80
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,133
MAKE SURE NO ONE
ON THE OUTSIDE

81
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,233
EVER DISCOVERS THAT IT WAS
A TRAITOR THAT KILLED HIM.

82
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,666
- UNDERSTOOD, SIR.

83
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,366
- Harry: THE NECROLIZED
HAS PREVAILED

84
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:14,333
OVER THE SUPERIORILIZED.

85
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:22,866
BUT HERE'S SOMETHING
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. 

86
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:24,700
HOW ON EARTH
WAS HE ACTIVATED?

87
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:27,133
HE MUST HAVE HAD
AN ACCOMPLICE.

88
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:31,100
OF COURSE!

89
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,033
TOKIOKA.

90
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:40,000
WAIT A MINUTE,
THAT INCIDENT.

91
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:44,333
HE MUST HAVE BEEN
THE ONE WHO DESTROYED

92
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,500
THE OUT-OF-CONTROL
NECROLIZER.

93
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:49,733
I GET IT NOW.

94
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,733
THAT MUST BE WHAT HAPPENED.

95
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,833
YOU'VE BEEN TRYING TO
RUIN THINGS FOR ME

96
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,433
FOR 13 YEARS, BRANDON.

97
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,400
YOU WANT REVENGE THAT BADLY.

98
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:02,400
( chuckles )

99
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:04,400
SO, YOU HATE ME THAT MUCH?

100
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,733
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
BRANDON?

101
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,433
- ( panting )

102
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,300
( grunts )

103
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,900
- HOLD IT!
- ( murmurs )

104
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:18,333
( grunts )

105
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,733
( gasps )

106
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:23,300
( gasps )

107
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,200
( whimpers )

108
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,566
- WHY DID YOU TRY
TO RUN AWAY?

109
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:33,366
YOU GOT INFORMATION,
DON'T YOU?

110
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:35,633
- IF YOU KNOW WHERE THE MAN
AND THE LITTLE GIRL ARE HIDING,

111
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,933
I RECOMMEND YOU TELL US,
YOU GOT THAT?

112
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,300
- UH...

113
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:40,966
I DON'T KNOW, I SWEAR.

114
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:42,300
- DON'T LIE TO US.

115
00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:43,466
- I WOULDN'T DO THAT.

116
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:44,966
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

117
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:46,566
- THEN WHY WERE YOU RUNNING?

118
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:47,766
- I OWE PEOPLE MONEY

119
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,566
AND I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE LOAN SHARKS.

120
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:51,566
- I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO LISTEN TO YOUR STORIES.

121
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:52,733
YOU'D BETTER
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

122
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,000
- YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE ME,

123
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:56,466
BUT I'M TELLING YOU,
I JUST DON'T KNOW.

124
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:57,666
- THAT'S TOO BAD.

125
00:07:57,733 --> 00:07:59,700
- ( murmurs )

126
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:02,666
- ( grunts )

127
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,633
- HURRY!  RUN!

128
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:07,933
- ( panting )
- ( gunfire )

129
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,333
- ( gasps, grunts )

130
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,800
( groans )

131
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,366
( grunts )

132
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:17,333
WHOA!

133
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,266
OH...

134
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,700
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
IT'S HER.

135
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,966
- SOMETHING WRONG?

136
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:26,433
- TAKE A LOOK FOR YOURSELF.

137
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,833
LOOKS LIKE WE FOUND THE GIRL
WHO WAS WITH THE TARGET.

138
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,033
- GOOD, I GOT IT.

139
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,733
I'LL GO REPORT IT
TO HEADQUARTERS. 

140
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:36,033
- ( gasps )

141
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,166
( grunts )

142
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,533
- ( grunts )

143
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,466
- HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
HERE...

144
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:51,966
- GET AWAY FROM ME!

145
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,466
- ( gasps )

146
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,866
- IF I'M INVOLVED
WITH YOU GUYS,

147
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:57,466
NO MATTER HOW MANY LIVES I HAVE,
IT WON'T BE ENOUGH.

148
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:59,466
SO STAY THE HELL
AWAY FROM ME.

149
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:00,800
( grunts )

150
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:02,100
( sighs )

151
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:21,733
- WHY DON'T WE GO
AND SEE MARIA?

152
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,233
- HUH?

153
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,666
- ( truck horn blares )

154
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,333
- ( cellphone rings )

155
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,900
( beeps )

156
00:09:29,966 --> 00:09:32,233
- Man: ( through cellphone )
UH, IS THIS BIG BRO BUNJI?

157
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,766
I JUST RECEIVED A REPORT

158
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,566
THAT TWO OF OUR GUYS
GOT WORKED OVER REAL GOOD

159
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:36,766
IN SECTION "C."

160
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,100
I'M THINKING IT WAS
MOST LIKELY OUR TARGET.

161
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,366
- Bunji: I SEE.

162
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:41,900
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP.

163
00:09:41,966 --> 00:09:44,833
I WANT EVERYBODY PULLED OUT
OF SECTION "C" RIGHT NOW.

164
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,500
- WHAT?  ARE YOU SURE?

165
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:48,233
- THAT'S RIGHT.
PULL 'EM ALL OUT.

166
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,833
I'LL TAKE CARE OF
THE TARGET.

167
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,566
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

168
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,933
- Mika: REALLY?

169
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,600
SO MY MOM ACTUALLY
USED TO LIVE IN THIS PLACE?

170
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:05,933
- Grave: YEAH.

171
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,500
- HURRY.
COME ON, HURRY.

172
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:12,266
GEE, YOU SURE ARE SLOW, GRAVE.

173
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,966
( sighs )

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,566
THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE
MY MOM USED TO LIVE.

175
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,900
THIS IS WHERE
MY MOM GREW UP.

176
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,933
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN AWHILE
SINCE ANYONE LIVED HERE.

177
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:37,966
NOW LET ME SEE...

178
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:41,300
I THINK THERE WAS PROBABLY
A COUCH RIGHT OVER THERE, 

179
00:10:41,366 --> 00:10:43,633
AND ANOTHER ONE 
RIGHT OVER HERE.

180
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,166
AND THERE MUST HAVE BEEN
A TABLE THIS BIG

181
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:48,066
RIGHT HERE IN THE CENTER.

182
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:50,633
THIS IS WHERE
THE SIDE TABLE WOULD BE,

183
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,500
AND A STAND WOULD GO HERE.

184
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:56,033
I'M GUESSING THIS IS PROBABLY
WHERE THE CABINET WAS.

185
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,700
AND THEN MY MOM
WOULD BE SITTING HERE

186
00:10:58,766 --> 00:10:59,800
KNITTING.

187
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:01,100
I CAN SEE HER NOW.

188
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,633
- BRANDON? 
- ( gasps )

189
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:11,566
- MARIA.

190
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:12,900
- OH, BRANDON.

191
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:15,000
YOU GOT IN ANOTHER FIGHT,
DIDN'T YOU?

192
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:17,300
YOU CAN BE SO HOPELESS,
REALLY.

193
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:23,300
DID YOU HAVE TO GET
YOURSELF HURT SO BADLY?

194
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:27,500
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
DOES IT HURT?

195
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,600
YOU DON'T SAY MUCH
TO ME, DO YOU?

196
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,933
YOU'RE ALWAYS LIKE THIS.

197
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,600
SO SILENT.

198
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,566
ALL YOU DO IS LOOK AT ME
WITHOUT SAYING A WORD.

199
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,033
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SAY ANYTHING.

200
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,033
I CAN STILL HEAR YOU.

201
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,666
I WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE 
TO HEAR YOU LIKE THAT.

202
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:57,833
NO MATTER HOW SAD

203
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,033
OR HOW PAINFUL IT MAY BE,

204
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,966
YOUR VOICE ALWAYS
MANAGES TO REACH ME

205
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:03,900
LOUD AND CLEAR.

206
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:05,233
SO PLEASE,

207
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,400
JUST HOLD ME FOR NOW,
BRANDON.

208
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:10,066
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SAY A WORD.

209
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:14,066
I JUST WANT TO BE
IN YOUR ARMS HERE, LIKE THIS.

210
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,733
- MARIA.

211
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,366
- BRANDON.

212
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,200
- GRAVE!
- HMM?

213
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:28,366
- HEY, WHAT'D I SAY ABOUT
PAYING ATTENTION TO LADIES?

214
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,866
- ( chuckles )

215
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,066
- BY THE WAY,

216
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:39,766
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S TIME
THAT YOU TELL ME?

217
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:43,233
I MEAN, ABOUT YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH MOM.

218
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,400
- ( exhales )

219
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:50,300
- MY LEGS ARE NUMB FROM
RUNNING AROUND LOOKING FOR YOU.

220
00:12:50,366 --> 00:12:52,166
BIG GUY.

221
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,733
- ( exhales )

222
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:05,566
- ( gasps )

223
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:06,700
- DAMN.

224
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:08,100
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOUR OLD REFLEXES

225
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,233
ARE COMING BACK.

226
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,833
- BUNJI KUGASHIRA.

227
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,766
- SO THEN YOU REMEMBER ME?

228
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,466
- KUGASHIRA?

229
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:20,866
THAT'S RIGHT.
I'VE HEARD OF HIM.

230
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,300
HE'S PART OF MILLENNION.

231
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:23,466
- IT'S YOU.

232
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:24,866
SO YOU'RE BIG DADDY'S
DAUGHTER.

233
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:26,300
HIS ONLY OFFSPRING.

234
00:13:26,366 --> 00:13:28,300
- ( gasps )

235
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:30,800
- SORRY, BUT I'M NOT
INTERESTED IN A KID.

236
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:32,733
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE 
YOURSELF DISAPPEAR?

237
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,133
- YOU AND YOUR GUYS
KILLED MY MOM, DIDN'T YOU?

238
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,466
- YEAH, I GUESS WE DID.

239
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:39,133
- TELL ME WHY.

240
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,466
WHAT IS IT MY MOM
EVER DID TO YOU GUYS?

241
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:44,066
ALL SHE WAS DOING WAS 
LEADING A NORMAL LIFE!

242
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:47,166
I DON'T UNDERSTAND!
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO KILL HER?

243
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:50,033
- I TAKE IT THAT HARRY MACDOWEL
JUST ISN'T TOO FOND

244
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,033
OF ANYTHING THAT'LL
REMIND HIM OF BIG DADDY,

245
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,033
THAT'S ALL.

246
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,700
- ( gasps )

247
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:56,000
NO WAY.

248
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:59,566
THAT CAN'T BE THE REASON.

249
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:00,966
- IT WAS ALL
'CAUSE OF YOU.

250
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:03,600
YOU WERE THE ORIGINAL REASON,
BIG GUY.

251
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,100
- ( gasps )

252
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,766
- YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU
WERE GONNA CLIMB

253
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,833
UP THE LADDER TOGETHER
WITH HARRY,

254
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,300
AND THE REASON I AGREED
TO JOIN MILLENNION

255
00:14:11,366 --> 00:14:13,600
WAS IN ORDER TO SUPPORT
THE TWO OF YOU.

256
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,833
BUT YOU QUIT MIDSTREAM.

257
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,533
IT WAS ALL YOUR FAULT.

258
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,000
AND EVEN NOW
AFTER YOU'RE DEAD,

259
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:23,366
YOU STILL MANAGE
TO GET IN OUR WAY.

260
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:25,300
WHY IS THAT?

261
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,300
ANSWER ME!

262
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:33,200
YOU DON'T WANT TO ANSWER?

263
00:14:33,266 --> 00:14:35,166
OR IS IT THAT
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

264
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,866
WELL, WHATEVER.

265
00:14:38,933 --> 00:14:40,533
EITHER WAY,
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

266
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,333
TRAITORS CANNOT BE FORGIVEN.

267
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:48,200
AND YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO TAUGHT ME THAT, RIGHT?

268
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:51,300
THE SO-CALLED
"CODE OF IRON."

269
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:56,233
- ( grunts )

270
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,633
( gasps )

271
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,866
OH, GRAVE.

272
00:15:06,766 --> 00:15:08,333
PLEASE BE CAREFUL.

273
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:29,800
- I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE
THAT YOU'VE BEEN NECROLIZED.

274
00:15:29,866 --> 00:15:31,133
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT,

275
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,466
THAT PUTS ME AT
A DISADVANTAGE,

276
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:33,800
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

277
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,100
THAT'S WHY...

278
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:38,800
YOU'LL EXCUSE ME
IF I USE THIS.

279
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:39,766
- ( gasps )

280
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,866
- ( gasps )

281
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,866
OH, GRAVE.

282
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,500
- THIS LITTLE TOY HERE
WAS CUSTOM MADE

283
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:06,933
AT OUR RESEARCH CENTER.

284
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,300
IT PARALYZES
THE TISSUES IN THE BODY

285
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:10,933
UNTIL THEY
COMPLETELY BREAK DOWN.

286
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,933
I HEARD THAT IT WORKS
REAL WELL ON DEAD BODIES.

287
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,766
BYE, BRO.

288
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:21,033
- ( grunts )

289
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:50,133
- ( beeps )

290
00:16:56,066 --> 00:16:57,366
- HMM?

291
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:14,500
- ( grunts )

292
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:15,800
( straining )

293
00:17:20,566 --> 00:17:22,933
( groans )

294
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,033
- WHY'D YOU DO IT?

295
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,466
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO GO
AND BETRAY MILLENNION?

296
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,533
I'M ASKING YOU 
TO TELL ME WHY.

297
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,033
- OH!

298
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,400
( grunts )

299
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:43,400
- THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT
YOU WERE THE NUMBER-ONE SWEEPER.

300
00:17:43,466 --> 00:17:46,000
AND YOU WERE THE BEST SWEEPER
MILLENNION EVER HAD.

301
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,000
WEREN'T YOU DOING
EVERYTHING YOU COULD

302
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:49,700
SO THAT HARRY COULD
BECOME THE BOSS?

303
00:17:49,766 --> 00:17:53,200
SO WHY'D YOU BETRAY US?
ANSWER ME.

304
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:54,633
- ( grunts )

305
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,333
- DO YOU KNOW WHY
I DECIDED TO COME HERE

306
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,333
ALL BY MYSELF?

307
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,066
IT'S BECAUSE
THE WAY I SEE IT,

308
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,366
I WAS YOUR FIRST APPRENTICE.

309
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:16,366
BECAUSE YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO TAUGHT ME ABOUT

310
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:18,366
THE CODE OF IRON.

311
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:20,366
THAT'S WHY.

312
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,400
THAT'S WHY.

313
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,566
I'VE GOTTA KILL YOU.

314
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:25,533
- ( grunts )

315
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,066
- STOP IT!

316
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:35,300
I BEG YOU,
PLEASE DON'T SHOOT.

317
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:39,100
WEREN'T YOU BOTH
IN THE SAME GROUP?

318
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,300
DOESN'T THAT MAKE
THE TWO OF YOU COMRADES?

319
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:43,700
- HEY, DON'T BLAME ME.

320
00:18:43,766 --> 00:18:45,866
HE WAS THE ONE WHO WENT
AND BETRAYED THE GROUP.

321
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:47,233
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

322
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,733
I KNOW I'VE ONLY
JUST MET HIM,

323
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,733
BUT IN THE SHORT TIME
THAT I'VE KNOWN HIM, 

324
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,466
I CAN TELL THAT HE'S NOT
THE TYPE OF PERSON

325
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:54,366
WHO'S CAPABLE OF
BETRAYING ANYBODY.

326
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:57,366
I'M SURE THAT HE HAD TO
HAVE A GOOD REASON.

327
00:18:57,433 --> 00:18:59,366
- YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

328
00:18:59,433 --> 00:19:01,366
- HUH?

329
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,933
- BUT REGARDLESS OF WHAT
ACTUALLY HAPPENED BACK THEN,

330
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,800
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS
THAT HE ABANDONED US.

331
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:08,400
AND NOW HE'S COME BACK TO GET

332
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:10,466
REVENGE AGAINST
THE ORGANIZATION.

333
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:11,800
IT'S MY JOB TO KILL HIM

334
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:13,400
AND MAKE SURE
HE STAYS THAT WAY.

335
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:15,133
THAT'S THE RULE.

336
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,133
NO EXCEPTIONS.

337
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,266
- PLEASE DON'T!

338
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,900
- SHUT YOUR TRAP.

339
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:21,166
- PLEASE DON'T DO IT.

340
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:22,900
YOU MUSTN'T!

341
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:25,133
- DIDN'T I JUST TELL YOU
TO SHUT UP?

342
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,833
- ( crying )

343
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,100
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS!

344
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,166
- I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO SHUT UP!

345
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:33,500
- I'M BEGGING YOU,
PLEASE!

346
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:34,633
- ( groans )

347
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,833
FOR THE LAST TIME,
SHUT UP.

348
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,133
- PLEASE, DON'T!

349
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,433
- SHUT UP OR ELSE!

350
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,633
- ( screams )

351
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,766
NO, STOP!

352
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,633
GRAVE, HELP ME!
( screams )

353
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,566
STOP IT!

354
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,200
PLEASE, I'M SORRY!

355
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:55,833
STOP!  JUST STOP!

356
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,466
( crying )

357
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,200
- WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY
KNOW ABOUT ANYTHING?

358
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:08,133
YOU DON'T KNOW A SINGLE
THING ABOUT ANY OF US, 

359
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,466
DO YOU HEAR ME?

360
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:12,166
AND YOU DEFINITELY
DON'T KNOW JACK SHIT ABOUT ME.

361
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:13,233
- ( crying )

362
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,400
- THIS IS NOTHING FOR A KID
TO BE INVOLVED WITH.

363
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:18,666
- BUNJI...

364
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:19,666
- HUH?

365
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:22,066
- BUNJI!

366
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:24,000
( shouts )

367
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:25,300
- ( grunts )

368
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,333
( stammers )

369
00:20:35,966 --> 00:20:38,566
( groans )

370
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:40,333
( chuckles )

371
00:20:41,966 --> 00:20:44,433
- BUNJI.

372
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,733
- ( grunts )

373
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,866
- ( grunting )

374
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,600
- Bunji: BIG GUY,

375
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,566
PLEASE DON'T
BETRAY THE FAMILY.

376
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,600
- ( computer keys clacking )

377
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:27,266
- UM, SO HOW IS GRAVE DOING?

378
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,666
- WHATEVER THAT STUFF WAS
THEY SHOT INTO HIM

379
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:31,266
WAS VERY DANGEROUS.

380
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,900
WITH THE EQUIPMENT
WE HAVE HERE,

381
00:21:32,966 --> 00:21:34,433
EVEN IF HE DOES RECOVER,

382
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,900
HE'LL ONLY BE ABLE TO REGAIN
ABOUT 70% OF HIS ABILITIES. 

383
00:21:37,966 --> 00:21:39,666
- OH, NO.

384
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:46,366
ON THAT DAY,

385
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:49,166
I THINK I ACTUALLY
HEARD HIM CRY.

386
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:51,366
IT WAS A REALLY
AWFUL SOUND.

387
00:21:51,433 --> 00:21:53,633
SUCH A SAD
AND POWERFUL VOICE,

388
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,500
SO FULL OF PAIN.

389
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:57,133
JUST LIKE AN ANIMAL'S CRY.

390
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,366
AND THAT WAS WHEN
IT STARTED SNOWING.

391
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:03,666
- ( breathes deeply )

392
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,333
( grunts )

393
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,566
- GRAVE!

394
00:22:08,633 --> 00:22:10,066
- ( gasps )

395
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:12,333
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

396
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,000
REALLY, YOU CAN STOP NOW.
( crying )

397
00:22:20,066 --> 00:22:21,500
- ( groans )
- GRAVE?

398
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:43,200
- I WOULD NEVER BETRAY.

399
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,000
- ( theme music playing )

400
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,733
- ( singing in Japanese )

401
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:17,166
- Grave: A REUNION WITH
THE ONE WHO SAVED MY LIFE

402
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:18,766
WHEN I WAS JUST A ROOKIE.

403
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,800
WE WERE LIKE A FAMILY
FOR AWHILE.

404
00:24:21,866 --> 00:24:24,333
IT ENDS WITH A TRAGEDY
AND A SCREAM--

405
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,633
A SAD SCREAM THAT SHAKES
THE ENTIRE CITY.
