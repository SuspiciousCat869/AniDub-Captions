1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,966
( theme music playing )

2
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,300
- ( inaudible )

3
00:01:54,566 --> 00:02:00,433
- ( monitor beeping )

4
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,066
- ( laughs )

5
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:31,733
- Bunji: IF YOU ASK ME, IT
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE LIGHTNING'S

6
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,933
GONNA MAKE A MOVE.

7
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
SEEMS LIKE ALL THESE RUMORS
ABOUT THEM GETTING READY

8
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:37,966
TO WAGE WAR AGAINST MILLENNION,

9
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,733
COULD HAVE BEEN A FALSE ALARM.

10
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,866
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

11
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:47,500
I GUESS BLOOD WAR DIDN'T LIVE
UP TO HIS REPUTATION, DID HE?

12
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:51,800
HEY BRO?

13
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,466
- ARE YOU READY FOR THIS LITTLE
BUDDY? WE'LL HAVE TO SEE.

14
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:02,266
- IT'S BLOOD WAR!

15
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:12,366
- NOW, LET'S BEGIN...

16
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,200
THE WAR.

17
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:39,933
- ( people screaming )

18
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:53,400
- ( maniacal laughter )

19
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,433
MILLENNION...

20
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,500
FROM THIS MOMENT ON,
THIS IS OUR BATTLEFIELD!

21
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,800
- ( tire screeches )

22
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:24,466
- ( horn honks )

23
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:27,133
- YOU'RE BLOCKING THE
ROAD, YOU STUPID BASTARD!

24
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,566
- YOU BASTARDS!

25
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,100
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

26
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:48,000
- BOSS RUN PLEASE...
YOU GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE...

27
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:52,000
- HEY YOU GUYS! WHAT THE
HELL! NO, DON'T!

28
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:58,766
- HARRY! I JUST HEARD CARLOS
AND IRVINE WERE TAKEN OUT!

29
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,866
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

30
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,533
THOSE GUYS WERE BOTH EXECUTIVES!

31
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,733
THOSE LIGHTNING BASTARDS...

32
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:13,100
- RIGHT. I AGREE, RANDY. YEAH.

33
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,833
TELL ALL THE EXECUTIVES
TO TIGHTEN UP

34
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,366
THEIR SECURITY RIGHT AWAY.

35
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:18,733
- WHAT ABOUT BIG
DADDY'S GUARD DETAIL?

36
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,566
- I'VE ALREADY SENT MY
OVER KILLS.

37
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:23,700
- Big Daddy: DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME.

38
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:25,500
WHAT'S IMPORTANT
RIGHT NOW IS MARIA.

39
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:28,166
I WANT BODYGUARDS WATCHING
HER ROUND THE CLOCK.

40
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:30,900
BE AS DISCREET AS POSSIBLE,
I DON'T WANT HER TO NOTICE.

41
00:05:30,966 --> 00:05:32,266
- Man: DON'T WORRY, MASTER.

42
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,500
IT'S ALREADY BEEN
TAKEN CARE OF, I ASSURE YOU.

43
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,966
- Man: HARRY, A CASINO
MANAGED BY

44
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:48,733
THE ORGANIZATION WAS ATTACKED!

45
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,866
SO WAS A WAREHOUSE THAT IT
USES AS A DISTRIBUTION CENTER!

46
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:53,933
- Harry: DAMN IT!

47
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,133
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE
INVOLVING ORDINARY PEOPLE!

48
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,000
THAT BASTARD, BLOOD WAR!

49
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:03,766
I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN RID
OF HIM WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

50
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,300
- HARRY, HUSSAN IS ON THE LINE!

51
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:10,266
SAYS LIGHTNING JUST GOT THERE.

52
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,500
- ALL RIGHT. TELL HIM
TO KILL THOSE BASTARDS.

53
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:16,333
- ( gunfire )

54
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:20,400
- ( screaming )

55
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,866
- TOUGH SHIT GUYS!

56
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,433
- ( gunshots )

57
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,933
- HUSSAN'S ENTIRE OFFICE
WAS WIPED OUT?

58
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,866
- YES, SIR. NO SURVIVORS.
THEY'RE ALL DEAD.

59
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:32,166
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS! WE SENT
25 OF OUR BEST GUYS THERE!

60
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:34,533
- AND THERE WERE NO LIGHTNING
MEN AMONG THE DEAD?

61
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
- NO, NOT ONE.

62
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,033
- IT SOUNDS LIKE LIGHTNING
IS USING A BUNCH OF GUYS

63
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,833
JUST AS GOOD AS BRANDON.

64
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,233
- NO WAY LEE, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

65
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:45,600
- Harry: HEY BOB!

66
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:49,300
YOU SAID BLOOD WAR IS IN COMMAND
OF A 23 MAN CREW, RIGHT?

67
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:51,066
- THAT'S RIGHT AND
THE INFORMATION

68
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:53,966
IS ACCURATE TOO.
BELIEVE ME, HARRY!

69
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,400
- WE'VE HAD OVER 70 GUYS,
INCLUDING TWO EXECUTIVES,

70
00:07:58,466 --> 00:07:59,900
KILLED SO FAR.

71
00:07:59,966 --> 00:08:03,133
WE WERE WELL PREPARED BUT THEY
STILL CAUGHT US BY SURPRISE.

72
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,866
WHICH MEANS WE GOT A LEAK
SOMEWHERE, BIG TIME.

73
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:08,300
ON TOP OF THAT, THEY HAD NO
PROBLEM OVERPOWERING US

74
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:09,833
EVEN THOUGH WE OUTNUMBERED THEM.

75
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,766
SO, LIGHTNING MUST
HAVE A SECRET.

76
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:14,966
LIGHTNING, A MINOR PLAYER...

77
00:08:15,033 --> 00:08:18,066
SUDDENLY DECIDES TO WAGE AN ALL
OUT WAR AGAINST MILLENION,

78
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:20,133
A WAR THEY THINK THEY CAN WIN.

79
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:23,466
BECAUSE OF THAT SECRET.

80
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:25,400
- IF THEY HAD A SECRET
WEAPON OR SOMETHING,

81
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:27,433
DON'T YOU THINK I'D
KNOW ABOUT BY NOW?

82
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,000
- Harry: EXACTLY MY POINT.

83
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:31,300
YOU'RE THE BEST THERE IS

84
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:32,300
AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE UP TO,

85
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:34,166
THEN NOBODY DOES
AND WE'RE FLYING BLIND.

86
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:35,833
- ( phone rings )

87
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:37,700
- YEAH?

88
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:39,566
- Jude: HARRY, IT'S ME.

89
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:42,733
- IS THAT YOU, JUDE?
WHAT'S WRONG?

90
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,833
- LIGHTNING, THEY WIPED
OUT ALL OUR GUYS!

91
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,600
- WHAT?

92
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,466
NO MATTER HOW MANY
TIMES WE SHOT AT THEM,

93
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:53,400
THEY KEPT GETTING UP HARRY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

94
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:54,966
- Harry: THEY MUST BE
WEARING BODY ARMOR,

95
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,433
AIM AT THEIR HEADS AND LEGS!

96
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,066
- WE FIRED OF
THOUSANDS OF ROUNDS.

97
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:02,100
WE TURNED THEM INTO
SWISS CHEESE AND THEY JUST...

98
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,833
THEY STILL...

99
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:14,066
- ( gunfire )

100
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:15,966
- ( Jude screams )

101
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:17,766
- JUDE? JUDE!

102
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,600
- Gary: DAMN! DAMN!

103
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,000
DAMN, WHY THE HELL DID THOSE
STUPID LIGHTNING A-HOLES

104
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:48,700
HAVE TO START
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

105
00:09:48,766 --> 00:09:50,466
- KEEP YOUR GUARD UP
AND STOP WHINING!

106
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:57,733
- OH, SHIT!

107
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,433
THAT NUT CASE BLOOD WAR, IT'S
REALLY GETTING OUT OF HAND!

108
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:04,266
- BLOOD WAR...

109
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:07,833
- NOT GOOD ENOUGH!

110
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,700
IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH
TO CALL MY BATTLEFIELD!

111
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:16,633
- MARIA, HAVE YOU
HEARD THE LATEST NEWS?

112
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,733
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

113
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,433
- NO, WHAT'S UP?

114
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,133
- THEY SAID TWO GROUPS
OF MAFIA GUYS OPENED FIRE

115
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,033
ON EACH OTHER IN WENST!
IT'S GETTING SO DANGEROUS.

116
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,700
I WONDER WHAT THE POLICE
ARE GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

117
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,033
- HEY, BRO. WE'RE
SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE

118
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,733
OF LIGHTNING TERRITORY.

119
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,866
YOU MIGHT AS WELL PAINT
A BULLSEYE ON YOUR BACK.

120
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:42,300
YOU'RE JUST ASKING
TO BE A TARGET.

121
00:10:42,366 --> 00:10:45,100
- Brandon: THAT'S RIGHT.
- ARE YOU NUTS?

122
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:49,033
OH, YOU HAD GOING ME THERE FOR
A WHILE PAL, YOU REALLY DID.

123
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,533
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!

124
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:10,433
- IF YOU ASK ME, THIS IS
GONNA BE A REAL LONG WALK.

125
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:19,466
I'M DREAMING! RIGHT?

126
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:32,733
HEY WHAT'S WITH THESE GUYS?
WHY AREN'T THEY GOING DOWN?

127
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:37,233
- Blood War: LOOKS
LIKE I CAUGHT YOU NAPPING.

128
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:44,333
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY GUYS?
PRETTY TENACIOUS?

129
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,100
- BLOOD WAR... YOU...

130
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,466
- WELCOME TO THE BATTLEFIELD.

131
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,766
- SHAME ON YOU FOR ALLOWING
A MINOR PLAYER LIKE LIGHTNING

132
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,300
TO MAKE US LOSE FACE.

133
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:03,833
DO YOU NEED HELP,
HARRY?

134
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,700
- NO SIR, I'M HERE ONLY TO
GIVE A STATUS REPORT,

135
00:12:06,766 --> 00:12:08,333
NOT TO ASK FOR ANYTHING.

136
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,733
EXCEPT THAT YOU ALLOW ME AND
BRANDON HEAT TO CONTINUE

137
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,033
HANDLING
THIS SITUATION.

138
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,400
- TWO EXECUTIVES
HAVE BEEN KILLED!

139
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:16,166
YOU CALL THAT
HANDLING THE MATTER?

140
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:18,666
- BICKERING AMONGST OURSELVES
IS A WASTE OF TIME,

141
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:20,866
WE MUST DEAL WITH
THE MATTER AT HAND.

142
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:23,066
- FIRST WE MUST
MAINTAIN OUR REPUTATION.

143
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:26,066
WHICH MEANS OUR LEADERS CAN'T
BE SEEN AS FRIGHTENED OLD MEN.

144
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:29,600
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?
- HE'S RIGHT MR. ALZAC!

145
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,266
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO
NULLIFY THIS THREAT WITHOUT,

146
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,366
ADMITTING THAT ANYONE
IS STRONG ENOUGH TO THREATEN US.

147
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,666
- Bear: THREE DAYS.

148
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:39,666
GET IT DONE WITHIN THREE DAYS.

149
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,266
UNDERSTAND?

150
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:44,700
- UNDERSTOOD.

151
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:46,666
EVEN IF IT COSTS ME
MY LIFE, SIR.

152
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,133
- Bob: YOU SURE ABOUT THIS BOSS?

153
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,066
I MEAN SHOULDN'T WE ASK
THE FAMILY FOR HELP?

154
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:57,866
- YOU IDIOT! YOU SHOULD
KNOW THAT I NEVER DO

155
00:12:57,933 --> 00:12:59,433
WHAT I DON'T WANNA DO.

156
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,133
- Bob: YEAH, SURE.

157
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,200
- Harry: HEY, WHAT WOULD YOU
DO IF YOU SAW A DIAMOND

158
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:08,700
IN THE ROUGH LYING ON THE ROAD?

159
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:12,266
- I'D PULL OVER AND GRAB IT
OF COURSE. WOULDN'T YOU?

160
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,700
- I'D BE LOOKING FOR THE DIAMOND
MINE WHERE IT CAME FROM.

161
00:13:14,766 --> 00:13:16,966
WHY BE SATISFIED WITH ONLY ONE?

162
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:21,600
YOU GOT TO THINK OF THE FUTURE,
NOT JUST THE HERE AND NOW.

163
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:26,266
THINK OF THE FUTURE,
FAR INTO THE FUTURE.

164
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,466
- TELL ME SOMETHING GUYS.
DON'T YOU GET TIRED

165
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:33,666
OF STANDING IN THAT POSITION?

166
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,300
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
SAY SOMETHING?

167
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:44,366
- DO YOU WANT A SMOKE,
LITTLE BUDDY?

168
00:13:47,566 --> 00:13:48,600
SUIT YOURSELF.

169
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,100
THAT TASTES GOOD...

170
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,533
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A CIGARETTE
YOU SMOKE IN THE FIRES OF WAR.

171
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,033
SOMEHOW IT MAKES YOU
FEEL MORE ALIVE.

172
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,166
- WHY HAVEN'T YOU KILLED US?
- I'M WONDERING ABOUT THAT TOO.

173
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:14,200
- WHY ARE YOU OUT
TO GET MILLENNION?

174
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:20,533
- TELL ME SOMETHING, ARE
YOU THE TYPE WHO ALWAYS

175
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,833
HAS TO HAVE A REASON TO FIGHT?

176
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,833
STOP THINKING ABOUT
THINGS SO MUCH...

177
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,533
AND PAY ATTENTION TO THIS,

178
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,133
THAT'S HOW GUYS
LIKE US STAY ALIVE.

179
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,833
A SENSE OF DUTY, OBLIGATION,
GRATITUDE AND VENGEANCE.

180
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,533
THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT.

181
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:41,433
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

182
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,366
- THERE'S SOMETHING WE
WANT YOU TO GIVE US.

183
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,300
THE BIG BOSS, HIMSELF.

184
00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:48,766
WE WANT YOU TO BRING
US BIG DADDY'S HEAD.

185
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,300
HEY, STOP GLARING AT ME
LIKE THAT.

186
00:14:53,366 --> 00:14:57,400
I GET IT. YOU'RE COMPLETELY
LOYAL TO YOUR BOSS, RIGHT?

187
00:14:57,466 --> 00:15:00,233
OF COURSE YOU ARE BUT
NOW THINK ABOUT THIS.

188
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,166
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WHEN THE WAR'S OVER

189
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:04,833
AND YOUR BOSS ISN'T
AROUND ANYMORE?

190
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:08,033
BELIEVE ME, A
YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU

191
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,900
WOULD BE BETTER OFF
WORKING FOR ME.

192
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,933
YOU'VE GOT A CRAVING
FOR CONFLICT...

193
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,833
ACTION...
STIMULATION...

194
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,400
THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT WHEN
YOU'RE RISKING YOUR LIFE.

195
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,800
I WON'T EVER LET YOU GET
BORED. I'LL MAKE YOUR LIFE

196
00:15:29,866 --> 00:15:32,700
MORE THRILLING THAN
IT'S BEEN BEFORE.

197
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,700
- THAT DOESN'T SOUND TOO BAD.

198
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,066
- ( laughs )

199
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:49,500
I KNEW I WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU!
I KNEW IT ALL ALONG.

200
00:15:49,566 --> 00:15:52,033
COME SEE ME TOMORROW
NIGHT AT MIDNIGHT.

201
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,166
MEET ME AT THE HARBOR.

202
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:54,866
WAREHOUSE NUMBER 28.

203
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:57,366
- TILL THEN, NO MORE
ATTACKS, AGREED?

204
00:15:57,433 --> 00:16:00,100
- AGREED, YOU HAVE
MY WORD ON IT.

205
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,533
SEE YOU THEN, KID.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

206
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:16,500
- SO, WHAT'S UP BRO?
WHAT DID HE WANT?

207
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,100
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

208
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,700
WHAT IS IT BRO?

209
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:34,466
- Cannon: SETTLE IT WITH ONE
ALL OUT ATTACK?

210
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:37,433
BLOOD OF THE BATTLEFIELD STYLE?

211
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,266
- Blood War: WHY JUST KILL
A FEW AT A TIME?

212
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,200
THE MORE BODIES WE CAN
LAY OUR HANDS ON,

213
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,900
THE BIGGER OUR
ADVANTAGE, RIGHT?

214
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:45,466
- SO YOU MEAN, NECROLYZE THEM?

215
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:48,100
- WE'LL HAVE THE MOST POWERFUL
ARMY IN THE WORLD.

216
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:51,666
A TOAST TO AMBITION AND SUCCESS.

217
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,766
BRINGS BACK MEMORIES...

218
00:16:58,366 --> 00:17:01,600
CANNON, DO YOU REMEMBER
THE SUNSET THAT DAY?

219
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,133
- SURE. I'LL NEVER FORGET IT.

220
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:50,400
- Brandon: THIS MAY BE THE
LAST TIME I LAY EYES ON MARIA.

221
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,333
SOMEHOW THE PIERCING
EYES OF BLOOD WAR...

222
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,066
THE MAN THEY CALL THE BLOOD
OF THE BATTLEFIELD...

223
00:17:58,133 --> 00:18:00,166
HAS MADE ME FEEL THIS WAY.

224
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:02,533
- Man on TV: AFTER TWO LONG DAYS
OF WIDESPREAD VIOLENCE,

225
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,700
THE FEUD BETWEEN TWO MAFIA
ORGANIZATIONS FINALLY SEEMS

226
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:06,833
TO HAVE COME TO AN END.

227
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,966
HOWEVER, KNOWLEDGEABLE
SOURCES HAVE TOLD US

228
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:10,400
THAT THEY ARE NOT OPTIMISTIC...

229
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:13,166
AND THAT THE VIOLENCE MAY
RESUME WITHOUT WARNING.

230
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:16,666
CITIZENS ARE THEREFORE ADVISED
TO TAKE EXTRA PRECAUTIONS.

231
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:32,033
- Brandon: I'LL TAKE THIS ONE.

232
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,000
- ARE YOU SURE? THE ONLY
AMMO YOU CAN USE

233
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:36,433
ON THAT GUN IS .45
CALIBER D POINTS.

234
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,366
SO IT'S NOT A REAL
PRACTICAL WEAPON,

235
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:40,000
THE KICK IS SO STRONG,
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE...

236
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:42,166
- AND A COUPLE OF THOUSAND
ROUNDS OF AMMO.

237
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:43,000
- HUH?

238
00:18:46,566 --> 00:18:49,233
OF COURSE, WHATEVER YOU SAY.
HAPPY TO BE OF SERVICE.

239
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:52,566
- Bunji: BRANDON AND I
SHOT THEM WITH ENOUGH

240
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:53,866
LEAD TO SINK A BATTLESHIP.

241
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:57,266
WE SHOT THEM OVER AND OVER
AGAIN. IN THE HEART, THE HEAD.

242
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,866
THEY JUST KEPT COMING AT US.

243
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:00,266
- COME ON! THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

244
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,133
- GUESS YOU MUST HAVE WATCHED
ONE TOO MANY HORROR MOVIES.

245
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,666
- Bunji: LISTEN YOU MORONS!
I'M NOT KIDDING!

246
00:19:07,766 --> 00:19:09,533
THESE LIGHTNING GUYS ARE TOUGH.

247
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,833
WE CLOSE OUR EYES FOR
A SECOND AND THEY WIN.

248
00:19:12,466 --> 00:19:13,500
- CAN'T BE...

249
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,133
- ( engine revving )

250
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:24,100
- THAT'S BRANDON'S CAR.
WHERE'S HE GOING?

251
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,400
DON'T TELL ME...

252
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,266
- ( gunshots )

253
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,866
- WHAT A SURPRISE.

254
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:55,000
SUCH A CLOSE FRIEND
IS A TRAITOR.

255
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,566
BOB WOULD BE DEVASTATED.

256
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:01,633
- HARRY... HOW DID YOU...

257
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,233
- IT WAS QUITE EASY.

258
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,633
I LOOKED FOR SOME
COMMON DENOMINATOR...

259
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,266
AMONG THE EXECUTIVES THAT
LIGHTNING ATTACKED.

260
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,200
ONLY A FEW OF US KNEW WHERE
THEIR SAFE HOUSES WERE.

261
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:14,100
SO I LOOKED AT THE PERSONNEL
FILES AND LOW AND BEHOLD,

262
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:17,466
YOU AND CANNON VULCAN ARE FROM
THE SAME HOMETOWN.

263
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:19,700
STUPID OF ME NOT TO
HAVE NOTICED IT BEFORE.

264
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:46,133
- HOW YOU DOING LITTLE BUDDY?

265
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,633
YOU'RE A REAL PUNCTUAL GUY,
I LIKE THAT.

266
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,633
- SO TELL ME, LEE...

267
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,900
WERE YOU LIGHTNING'S SPY
FROM THE GET GO?

268
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,666
- NO, IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

269
00:20:58,733 --> 00:21:01,266
- WHAT'S LIGHTNING HIDING LEE?
WHAT'S THEIR SECRET?

270
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,233
- YOU, HARRY MACDOWEL...

271
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,866
ARE A VERY BRILLIANT
AND AMBITIOUS MAN.

272
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,933
- DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

273
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,233
- ALRIGHT THEN. IF I TELL
LIGHTNING'S SECRET,

274
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,200
WILL YOU LET ME GO?

275
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:16,966
- NO, OF COURSE I WON'T. YOU
KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES FOR

276
00:21:17,033 --> 00:21:19,866
THE BREAKING THE CODE OF
IRON AS WELL AS I DO.

277
00:21:20,566 --> 00:21:23,466
THE ORGANIZATION CAN ONLY
OFFER A TRAITOR ONE THING.

278
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:26,266
AND THAT IS DEATH.

279
00:21:28,466 --> 00:21:30,400
- YEAH, I GUESS.

280
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,833
- YOU'RE ALONE? WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

281
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,733
WHAT THE HELL IS
THE MATTER WITH YOU?

282
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,866
I TOLD YOU TO BRING YOUR BOSS.

283
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:42,500
SO WHERE IS HE?
WHERE'S BIG DADDY?

284
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,566
HUH?

285
00:21:49,566 --> 00:21:51,833
YOU TRIED TO PLAY ME, DIDN'T YA?

286
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,600
- Lee: DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU
CAN BEAT ME?

287
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,433
HARRY MACDOWEL!

288
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:02,100
-TRY ME AND YOU'LL FIND OUT...

289
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,166
BALLADBIRD LEE!

290
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,466
- ( Blood war laughing )

291
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:23,400
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TAKE YOU OUT FIRST,

292
00:22:23,466 --> 00:22:28,200
AND THEN TURN THE ENTIRE CITY
INTO A BATTLEFIELD!

293
00:22:28,266 --> 00:22:30,766
- Brandon: NO, THE
BATTLEFIELD IS HERE.

294
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,400
- WHAT THE HELL?

295
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:43,066
- IN A FEW MOMENTS I'LL TURN
THIS PLACE INTO A BATTLEFIELD.

296
00:22:44,866 --> 00:22:47,366
- ( pop song playing )

297
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,466
- ( man singing )

298
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:17,433
- Brandon: WHY DO I BELONG
TO THE ORGANIZATION?

299
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,066
WHY DO I PULL THE TRIGGER?

300
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:24,433
SCREAMING AS I FACE
SOMETHING INHUMAN.

301
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,400
BECAUSE THIS IS MILLENION,
THE CODE OF IRON.
