1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,700
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:47,033
- ( ticking )

3
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,366
- ( beeping )

4
00:01:52,366 --> 00:01:54,400
- IT'S CALLED
CEREBRAL THROMBOSIS--

5
00:01:54,466 --> 00:01:55,933
A BLOOD CLOT IN THE BRAIN

6
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,900
CAUSED BY EXTREMELY
HIGH CHOLESTEROL

7
00:01:57,966 --> 00:01:59,033
DUE TO OVEREATING.

8
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,866
( gasps, whimpers )

9
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:02,266
- ARE YOU MAKING
FUN OF BOB?

10
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,900
- WAIT A MINUTE.
PLEASE WAIT.

11
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:05,900
I'VE COME TO MAKE
A SUGGESTION

12
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:07,333
THAT MIGHT SAVE HIS LIFE.

13
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,566
- SUGGESTION?
- I'M OF THE FIRM BELIEF

14
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:11,900
THAT THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE
BOB POUNDMAX'S LIFE

15
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,800
IS TO TURN HIM
INTO A SUPERIOR.

16
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:14,900
- A SUPERIOR?

17
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:16,966
- SIMPLY SPEAKING,
IT'S AN ORGMAN

18
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:19,000
CAPABLE OF INDEPENDENT THOUGHT.

19
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:20,666
BUT THE SUPERIORIZATION PROCESS

20
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:22,633
HAS YET TO BE USED
SUCCESSFULLY.

21
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,433
SO IT WILL BE VERY RISKY,
VERY RISKY INDEED.

22
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,933
- I SEE.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,300
SO YOU'RE GOING TO USE MY
BEST FRIEND AS A GUINEA PIG.

24
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:30,866
- BUT AT LEAST
HE'D HAVE A CHANCE.

25
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:31,966
AS IT IS RIGHT NOW,

26
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:33,166
HE'LL EITHER
WAKE UP A VEGETABLE

27
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:35,033
OR NEVER WAKE UP...
( whimpers )

28
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,133
AT ALL.

29
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,166
- VERY WELL THEN.

30
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:42,766
IN THAT CASE, I WANT YOU TO
USE YOUR PROCEDURE ON ME FIRST.

31
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,300
USE MY BODY TO TEST

32
00:02:44,366 --> 00:02:46,666
THIS SUPERIORIZATION
PROCESS OF YOURS.

33
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,266
AND THEN,
IF YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL,

34
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:53,333
USE IT TO SAVE THE LIFE
OF MY BEST FRIEND BOB.

35
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,133
- ( giggles )

36
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,266
- HEY, GRAVE, HERE.

37
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,366
GOOD.  NOW YOU DON'T
LOOK SO SUSPICIOUS. 

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,600
HMM.

39
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,000
DON'T YOU GET HUNGRY?

40
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,533
I SEE, YOU CAN'T
HAVE A NORMAL MEAL.

41
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:43,566
KEEP AN EYE ON THIS,
ALL RIGHT?

42
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:45,400
WAIT HERE.

43
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:56,500
- SO YOU WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT MILLENNION?

44
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:58,566
- YES, I WANT TO KNOW
AS MUCH AS I CAN

45
00:03:58,633 --> 00:04:01,166
ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION
AND ABOUT ITS BOSS

46
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:02,633
HARRY MACDOWEL,
ITS MEMBERS,

47
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,866
AND ABOUT THOSE MONSTERS
THAT THEY'VE CREATED.

48
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,033
- ( laughs ) I SEE.

49
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,233
I DIDN'T THINK
THERE WAS ANYONE

50
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,600
WHO DIDN'T ALREADY
KNOW ALL THAT.

51
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,100
- WELL, YOU THOUGHT WRONG.
ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME?

52
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,000
- OF COURSE I'LL TELL YOU.

53
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:14,400
I'LL TELL YOU WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO KNOW

54
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:16,100
AS LONG AS YOU PAY ME.

55
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:19,400
MILLENNION IS
A MAFIA ORGANIZATION,

56
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:21,133
WHICH USE
THE CITY'S UNDERWORLD

57
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,600
TO LEVERAGE CONTROL
OF THE ENTIRE CITY:

58
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,866
ITS INTERNAL AFFAIRS, ECONOMY,
EVEN THE POLICE FORCE.

59
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,566
ON THE RECORD,
IT'S THE SENIOR PARTNER

60
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:33,633
OR MAJORITY STOCKHOLDER
IN OVER 300 LARGE CORPORATIONS.

61
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,600
IT'S SAID THAT
MILLENNION'S ASSETS

62
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:39,200
ARE LARGE ENOUGH TO BUY OUT
A WHOLE COUNTRY.

63
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:42,200
THE BOSS OF THE OPERATION'S
A GUY NAMED HARRY.

64
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:44,200
THIS GUY.

65
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:47,900
- SO THAT'S HARRY MACDOWEL.

66
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:50,266
- HIS NICKNAME
IS BLOODY HARRY.

67
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,666
HE'S CRUEL, CLEVER,
TOTALLY MERCILESS

68
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:54,933
AND EXTREMELY SHARP.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,500
SINCE HE BECAME THE BOSS
14 YEARS AGO,

70
00:04:57,566 --> 00:05:01,166
MILLENNION'S YEARLY PROFITS 
HAVE RISEN OVER 100% A YEAR.

71
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:02,366
THE ORGANIZATION
NOW BRINGS IN

72
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:05,966
MORE THAN 15 TIMES
WHAT IT DID THEN. 

73
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:08,300
DOWN THE CORPORATE LADDER
ARE HIS AIDES,

74
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:11,000
MILLENNION'S FOUR MOST
SENIOR EXECUTIVES KNOWN AS

75
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:12,766
"THE BIG FOUR."

76
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:16,266
FIRST IS BEAR WALKEN,
ADVISOR TO THE PREVIOUS BOSS.

77
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,533
OLD SCHOOL ALL THE WAY--
SCRUPULOUS, BRILLIANT

78
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,800
AND IF NECESSARY,
QUITE RUTHLESS.

79
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:26,600
THE FAT ONE IS BOB POUNDMAX,
CHIEF OF PUBLIC RELATIONS.

80
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,500
ACTUALLY IN CHARGE OF
A HUGE INFORMATION NETWORK.

81
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:32,533
HE CAN MANIPULATE EVERYTHING
FROM GAMBLING ODDS

82
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,700
TO THE STOCK MARKET
TO GOVERNMENT POLICY,

83
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:37,233
EVEN WHAT RUMORS WILL BE
HEARD ON THE STREET.

84
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,500
HE KNOWS EVERYTHING GOING ON
IN THIS TOWN

85
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:42,000
EVEN BEFORE IT HAPPENS.

86
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:44,366
I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT
THE OTHER TWO,

87
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:45,700
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE

88
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:47,600
'CAUSE THEY'RE RARELY
SEEN IN PUBLIC.

89
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,666
ONE OF THEM IS BALLADBIRD LEE.

90
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,666
HARRY'S RIGHT HAND.

91
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:54,766
RUNS MILLENNION'S FINANCES,

92
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,200
INCLUDING DISPERSAL
AND LAUNDERING OPERATIONS

93
00:05:57,266 --> 00:05:58,666
FOR THE UNDERWORLD ECONOMY.

94
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,133
HE'S SAID TO BE 
A RADICAL SADIST

95
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,700
WHO'S KILLED
OVER 2,000 PEOPLE.

96
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:06,733
LAST BUT NOT LEAST
IS THE HIT MAN

97
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,200
BUNJI KUGASHIRA.

98
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:10,166
HIS SUCCESS IS
DUE TO HIS SKILL

99
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:12,933
AS A PROFESSIONAL KILLER.
DOESN'T COUNT ON ANYONE. 

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,433
IN FACT, DOES JUST ABOUT
EVERYTHING ON HIS OWN.

101
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,700
MAKES HIM SOUND COOL TO CALL HIM
A LONER, DOESN'T IT?

102
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:22,233
TRUTH IS NO ONE
WANTS TO BE NEAR HIM.

103
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,766
GOOD THING HE LIKES
WORKING ALONE

104
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,066
'CAUSE EVERYONE WHO
WORKS WITH HIM ENDS UP DEAD.

105
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:28,400
AND IF YOU ASK HIM
WHY HE KILLED 'EM ALL,

106
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:30,333
HE'LL SAY THEY'RE USELESS.

107
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,900
SO WHAT ELSE
YOU WANT TO KNOW?

108
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:34,666
I REMEMBER NOW.

109
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:36,566
MILLENNION'S MONSTERS, RIGHT?

110
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:39,033
ACTUALLY, THEY'RE ORGMEN.

111
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,766
- ORGMEN?

112
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,933
- YEAH, THE REASON THEY
LOOK LIKE MONSTERS

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,366
IS THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE.

114
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:47,033
MILLENNION FOUND A WAY
TO TURN PEOPLE

115
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,600
INTO NEARLY
UNSTOPPABLE SOLDIERS

116
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,066
WHO'LL DO WHATEVER
THEY'RE PROGRAMMED TO DO.

117
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:53,200
AND THEY KEEP MAKING
MORE EVERY DAY.

118
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:56,800
MILLENNION WOULDN'T HAVE GROWN
HALF AS FAST WITHOUT THE ORGMEN.

119
00:06:56,866 --> 00:07:00,066
WITH THEM GUARDING
MILLENNION'S OPERATIONS,

120
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:02,300
THE COMPETITION
DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE.

121
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:04,333
NOT TO MENTION
THE MILLIONS THEY'RE MAKING

122
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,466
FROM EXPORTING ORGMEN
TO WAR ZONES IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

123
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:11,500
( scoffs ) MILLENNION SALESMEN 
ARE THE NEW MERCHANTS OF DEATH.

124
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:13,533
- IT'S ALL SO HORRIBLE.

125
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,633
- WELL, THAT'S ABOUT IT.
- THANKS A LOT, MISTER. 

126
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,000
- BY THE WAY, I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU WANTED THIS INFO

127
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,666
AND I DON'T WANT TO KNOW,

128
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,033
BUT I'M WARNING YOU.

129
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,066
DON'T GET INVOLVED
WITH MILLENNION.

130
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:29,533
- MAY I ASK YOU
ONE MORE QUESTION?

131
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,533
- AND THAT LAST
HUGE EXPLOSION,

132
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,833
I HEARD IT WAS THE ORGMEN 
BEING BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS

133
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,533
BY THE GUYS WHO
TOOK OUT THE BRIDGE.

134
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,966
- HUH, YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

135
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:40,000
THEN WHY WASN'T IT ON THE NEWS
LAST NIGHT, SMART GUY?

136
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:42,966
- BECAUSE THE ORGANIZATION
HAS ITS REPUTATION TO CONSIDER.

137
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:44,333
WHAT'S EVERYONE GONNA THINK

138
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,466
IF THEY FIND OUT
THE ORGMEN WERE DESTROYED?

139
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,100
- HEY, KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN,
WILL YOU?

140
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,433
SOMEBODY WILL HEAR YOUSE.

141
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,266
- ( whispers )
OH, RIGHT.  SORRY.

142
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,100
- HEY, LISTEN,
YOU KNOW THAT BIG MANSION

143
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,666
MILLENNION'S GOT
OVERLOOKING THE PORT?

144
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:57,366
WELL, I HEAR THEY'RE HAVING
A BIG BASH DOWN THERE TONIGHT.

145
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,533
- THAT FIGURES, KNOWING THEM.

146
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,400
- BUT THIS ONE'S GONNA
 BE SOMETHING SPECIAL.

147
00:08:01,466 --> 00:08:04,233
I HEAR THE BOSS AND ALL HIS 
TOP EXECS IS GONNA BE THERE.

148
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,900
- A REAL SNOB-FEST, HUH?
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

149
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:08,933
- YOU GOT ME,
BUT ONE THING'S FOR SURE.

150
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,900
IT'LL BE A HELL OF A PARTY.

151
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:12,000
- I GUESS THEY'RE
NOT TOO WORRIED

152
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:13,766
ABOUT THE ECONOMIC CRISIS, HUH?

153
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,800
MAYBE THEY'LL LET ME
JOIN MILLENNION.

154
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:17,666
- LIKE THAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN, RIGHT?

155
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:19,233
- ( both laugh )

156
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:23,700
- SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG.

157
00:08:23,766 --> 00:08:24,766
HUH?

158
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,966
I FOUND OUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU--

159
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:43,566
WHAT HAPPENED IN YOUR PAST

160
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:45,766
AND WHY YOU WERE KILLED.

161
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:51,133
- WHO?!  BRANDON HEAT?!

162
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,000
( laughs )

163
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,600
MY, OH MY.

164
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:55,866
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY
YEARS IT'S BEEN

165
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:58,133
SINCE I HEARD ANYONE
MENTION HIS NAME.

166
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,333
- YOU KNEW HIM?
- YEAH, I KNEW BRANDON.

167
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,566
HE WAS BORN AND RAISED
IN THIS TOWN LIKE I WAS.

168
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:05,533
FACT IS I KNEW THE KID
PRETTY WELL.

169
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,666
BACK THEN, HE WAS QUIET
AS A PROVERBIAL MOUSE. 

170
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:10,700
I NEVER KNEW WHAT
HE WAS THINKING. 

171
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:12,600
- HE JOINED MILLENNION,
DIDN'T HE?

172
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,266
- HE WAS THE FAVORITE
OF BIG DADDY--

173
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,633
THE FORMER BOSS--

174
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,566
AND PUSHED SO HARD,
HE WAS TOP LEVEL

175
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:20,266
BY THE TIME HE WAS 20.

176
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,133
- ( whispers )
BIG DADDY.

177
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,800
- BUT SOMETHING WENT WRONG

178
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:26,666
AND HE WAS KILLED FOR
BETRAYING THE ORGANIZATION.

179
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:31,233
THE IRONY WAS IT WAS HIS
BEST FRIEND THAT KILLED HIM.

180
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,700
- HIS BEST FRIEND?

181
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,133
- IT WAS HARRY.

182
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,866
BLOODY HARRY.

183
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,800
- HARRY.

184
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:42,833
- THAT'S RIGHT.

185
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,433
HE EVEN SAID
HOW IRONIC IT WAS

186
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,733
THAT YOU WERE KILLED
BY YOUR BEST FRIEND 

187
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
HARRY MACDOWEL.

188
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:49,600
BUT HE WAS NEVER ABLE
TO FIND OUT WHY.

189
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,800
GRAVE, MAYBE--

190
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:53,633
MAYBE WHEN YOUR
MEMORY RETURNS,

191
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,566
IF IT'D BE ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU,

192
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:57,466
DO YOU THINK YOU
COULD TELL ME

193
00:09:57,533 --> 00:09:58,833
A LITTLE ABOUT MY DAD?

194
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,033
AND MY--

195
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,900
MY MOTHER TOO?

196
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,566
THERE'S THAT PROVERBIAL
MOUSE SYNDROME AGAIN.

197
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,866
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
ALL THIS TIME?

198
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:19,800
- SHOPPING.

199
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:21,833
SORRY, DR. TOKIOKA.

200
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,300
- CALL ME "T."

201
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:25,233
MEN LIKE ME,
ARROGANT ENOUGH

202
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,166
TO IGNORE THE LAWS
OF HUMAN MORALITY,

203
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:29,333
DON'T DESERVE A NAME.

204
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,333
- WELL THEN, TELL ME, T.

205
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,700
- TELL YOU WHAT?

206
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,500
- YOU THINK WE CAN
BEAT MILLENNION?

207
00:10:43,966 --> 00:10:46,133
- WE CERTAINLY CAN'T
KEEP RUNNING AWAY

208
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,933
FOR THE REST 
OF OUR LIVES.

209
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,466
BUT DEALING WITH MILLENNION

210
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:51,700
WILL BE PROBLEMATIC
TO SAY THE LEAST.

211
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:53,866
- Grave: MILLENNION.
- Both: HUH?

212
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,766
- GRAVE?

213
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:03,000
- ( gunshot )

214
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:04,333
- ( cans clatter )

215
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:09,366
- OUR TARGET
IS WITHIN THE CITY.

216
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:10,900
LET'S REPORT IT.

217
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,900
- ( chains rattle )

218
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:48,200
- ( clangs )
- HMM?

219
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:52,166
- ( heavy footsteps
approaching )

220
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:17,433
- ( metal clanks )

221
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:20,500
- ( gunshots )

222
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:21,766
- GRAVE IS GONE?

223
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:22,766
- I'M AFRAID SO.

224
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,933
ALONG WITH A COMPLETE SET
OF FIGHTING GEAR.

225
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,466
- ( computer beeps )
- I'VE TRACED HIS SIGNAL,

226
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:28,200
BUT IT'LL TAKE QUITE 
A WHILE TO REACH HIM.

227
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:29,633
HE'S A LONG WAY FROM HERE.

228
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,300
- WHERE ON EARTH
DID HE GO?

229
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:33,933
- IF, AS I SUSPECT,
HE'S GOT HIS MEMORY BACK,

230
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,333
THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF PLACES
HE MIGHT BE HEADED.

231
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,066
- ( gasps )
MILLENNION HEADQUARTERS?

232
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,933
- WE'LL BE LEAVING
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

233
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,100
NOW GO GET READY.
WE'VE GOT TO HURRY.

234
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,033
- ( gunshots )

235
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,666
( gunshots )

236
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,800
- ( clapping )

237
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:27,400
- ( gun cocks )

238
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,000
- IT'S NO MISTAKE.
- YEAH.

239
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:36,700
HE'S BRANDON HEAT,
ALL RIGHT.

240
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:39,633
- LONG TIME NO SEE, BRANDON.

241
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,400
LOOKS LIKE
THE TIME BOB SPENT

242
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:44,566
MANIPULATING THAT INFORMATION
WAS A WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT.

243
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:46,233
YOU'RE HERE AFTER ALL.

244
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,666
I WONDER IF THAT'S BECAUSE
OF YOUR KEEN SENSE OF DUTY

245
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,433
OR JUST PLAIN STUPIDITY.

246
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,800
EITHER WAY,

247
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:53,600
YOU'VE DONE PRECISELY
WHAT I THOUGHT YOU'D DO,

248
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,500
USE NECROLIZATION TO
COME BACK FROM THE DEAD.

249
00:13:58,466 --> 00:14:00,366
- Bear: BRANDON.

250
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:02,800
HAVE YOU COME
TO TAKE YOUR REVENGE?

251
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,633
BRANDON?

252
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,766
- HMM?

253
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,300
- SOMETHING'S
WRONG WITH HIM.

254
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:13,000
- LOOKS LIKE HE'S HAVING SOME
 KIND OF FUNCTIONAL DISORDER.

255
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:14,333
- HOW PATHETIC.

256
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,233
- Bob: HOLD ON, BUNJI.

257
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,666
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, 
BRANDON, WE MISSED YOU.

258
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,733
YOU HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN
YOUR OLD PAL.

259
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,733
IT'S ME, BOB POUNDMAX,
REMEMBER?

260
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,033
OH, NO!  YOU'VE FORGOTTEN 
ALL ABOUT ME, HAVEN'T YOU?

261
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,800
YOU'RE NOT ONLY A TRAITOR,
YOU'RE A HEARTBREAKER TOO.

262
00:14:32,866 --> 00:14:35,400
HEY, BOSS, IF YOU DON'T MIND,

263
00:14:35,466 --> 00:14:37,266
I'D LIKE YOU TO
LEAVE THIS TO ME, ALL RIGHT?

264
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,933
- HE'S ALL YOURS.

265
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,500
- THANK YOU, BOSS.

266
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,200
- THIS IS THE CHANCE
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

267
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:47,533
MAKE SURE YOU SHOW THE TRAITOR
THAT NEW POWER OF YOURS.

268
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,800
- MAN, THIS IS GREAT. 
I GET TO USE MY POWERS

269
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:52,566
AND GET RID OF A TRAITOR
AT THE SAME TIME.

270
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:53,966
THANKS, LEE.

271
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:56,766
- MAKE SURE THAT YOU 
 COOK HIM THOROUGHLY.

272
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,133
- ( grunts )

273
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,633
YO, BRANDON.

274
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,000
( groans )

275
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,000
IT HURTS, BRANDON.

276
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:14,466
YOU'RE AN AWFUL
SNEAKY GUY,

277
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:17,533
PULLING A SURPRISE ATTACK
LIKE THAT ON AN OLD FRIEND.

278
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,233
IT MAKES ME SAD,

279
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,933
BRANDON!

280
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:23,933
- ( gasps )

281
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,900
- LOOKS LIKE A NASTY ONE.

282
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:29,966
I TELL YOU,
THOSE FUNCTIONAL DISORDERS

283
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:31,200
CAN BE A REAL BITCH.

284
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:32,566
THE SHAPE YOU'RE IN,

285
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:34,933
YOU'RE NOT EVEN GONNA
BE ABLE TO KNOCK ME DOWN.

286
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,466
YOU KNOW WHY?

287
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:38,200
BECAUSE...

288
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:42,133
BECAUSE I GOT
THIS <i>LITTLE</i> SURPRISE.

289
00:15:43,766 --> 00:15:46,666
POWER!  ENORMOUS POWER!

290
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:50,433
A POWER BEYOND NECROLIZATION.

291
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,866
THIS IS THE POWER
OF A SUPERIOR!

292
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,000
- I SUPPOSE I'M JUST
FEELING NOSTALGIC,

293
00:15:58,066 --> 00:16:00,866
BUT I FIND MYSELF
PREOCCUPIED WITH THE PAST

294
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:02,900
AND WITH MY MEMORIES
OF THAT MAN.

295
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:04,966
- HE BETRAYED
THE ORGANIZATION.

296
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:06,833
HE IS OUR ENEMY.

297
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,266
- YES, I KNOW.

298
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,933
IT'S JUST THAT
SEEING HIM AGAIN--

299
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,700
- IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.
FORGET IT.

300
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:14,200
RIGHT NOW, BRANDON HEAT

301
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,200
IS ABOUT TO GO BACK
TO HIS GRAVE AGAIN.

302
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,066
AND HE'S BEING SENT THERE
BY BOB POUNDMAX.

303
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:20,600
- TRUE ENOUGH.

304
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,700
- BIG GUY.

305
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:29,900
- ( explosion )

306
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:33,266
( explosion )

307
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,066
- ( rumbling )

308
00:16:41,566 --> 00:16:43,066
- ( wind rushes )

309
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:45,633
- ( helicopter overhead )

310
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,400
- ( high-pitched laughter )

311
00:16:51,366 --> 00:16:54,100
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF A SUPERIOR'S POWER?

312
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:58,100
GO BACK TO YOUR
GRAVE AGAIN AND ROT!

313
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:01,900
BRANDON!

314
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:13,133
THAT'S NOT GONNA
WORK ON ME.

315
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,466
YOU CAN'T HURT A SUPERIOR
WITH THAT PEASHOOTER.

EVEN FOR THE SAKE
OF HIS OWN BELIEFS.
