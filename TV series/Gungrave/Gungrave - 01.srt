1
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:12,500
Brandon: WERE WE WRONG?

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,066
DID WE MAKE THE WRONG
DECISION AFTER ALL?

3
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:21,633
I CAN'T SEEM TO REMEMBER

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,633
WHEN THINGS STARTED TO TAKE
A TURN FOR THE WORSE...

5
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,833
IN THE END IT TURNED OUT
LIKE THIS, STILL...

6
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,600
- ( gunfire )

7
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,133
- ( gasps )

8
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,866
- (gunshot)

9
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:12,366
- ( man screams )

10
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,266
- ( screams )

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,100
- ( beeping )

12
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:51,466
- ( roars )

13
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,800
- ( all screaming )

14
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,266
- Mika: HIS NAME IS BRANDON...

15
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:34,866
BRANDON HEAT...

16
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,833
- ( theme music playing )

17
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,233
- ( inaudible )

18
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,333
- Tokioka: THIS IS AN
AREA OUTSIDE THE JURISDICTION

19
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,533
OF LOCAL
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

20
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,000
THE PLACE IS FULL OF DANGEROUS
CRIMINALS AND WORTHLESS SCUM.

21
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:42,700
THAT'S WHAT IT'S KNOWN FOR.

22
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:44,766
WHICH MEANS THAT IT WILL
BE THE PERFECT PLACE

23
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,233
FOR US TO LAY LOW.

24
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,733
CONSIDERING THAT WE ARE
WANTED SUSPECTS.

25
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,700
WE'LL HIDE HERE.
JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

26
00:04:53,766 --> 00:04:56,400
WE WON'T STAY LONG.

27
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,266
- Mika: I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

28
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:08,200
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
DO THAT TO HIM?

29
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,500
- BECAUSE IT IS
NECESSARY TO DO SO.

30
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:15,733
THIS MAN HAS BEEN
ASLEEP FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

31
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,600
ANYONE FEELS DULL RIGHT
AFTER HE WAKES UP.

32
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,600
BUT THIS MAN IS A
LITTLE DIFFERENT.

33
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,600
HE'S A RATHER EXTREME CASE.

34
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:27,033
- YOU'RE SAYING THAT
HE'S NOT NORMAL?

35
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,500
- EXACTLY.

36
00:05:28,566 --> 00:05:30,633
BUT DON'T WORRY YOUR PRETTY
LITTLE HEAD, YOUNG LADY.

37
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,733
YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW
TOO MUCH ABOUT HIM.

38
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,300
IN ANY CASE,

39
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:36,866
IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT

40
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:39,700
THAT THE ORGANIZATION HAS
DECIDED TO HUNT YOU DOWN.

41
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:41,366
- ( gasps )

42
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:46,166
MY MOTHER TOLD ME
ABOUT HIM ONCE.

43
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:51,433
THAT MAN, BRANDON HEAT,
HE WAS AN OLD FRIEND OF HERS.

44
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,300
- I KNOW NOTHING AT ALL
ABOUT THAT MAN'S PAST.

45
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:57,066
ALL I KNOW IS THAT HE WAS
A GREAT SWEEPER.

46
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:58,666
- HE WAS?

47
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:04,500
- AND NOW, I HAVE TO GO OUT
AND PICK UP SOME EQUIPMENT.

48
00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:08,100
I'D APPRECIATE IT, IF YOU
STAYED HERE AND KEPT QUIET.

49
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,400
ONE MORE THING.
HE'S NOT CALLED BRANDON.

50
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:13,833
THAT NAME NO LONGER
BELONGS TO HIM.

51
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,833
HE'S CALLED GRAVE.

52
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,400
CALL HIM BEYOND THE GRAVE.

53
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,366
- HIS NAME IS
BEYOND THE GRAVE...

54
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:33,633
- BIG DADDY...

55
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,833
I WISH I COULD PEEK INTO HEAVEN
AND SEE THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE

56
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:43,300
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE MAN
YOU CHOSE AND YOUR DAUGHTER.

57
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:54,066
- I KNOW YOU. YOU'RE AN
OLD FRIEND OF MY MOTHER'S.

58
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,366
I'M SURE YOU'D LIKE TO SEE
HER AGAIN AND TALK TO HER.

59
00:06:58,433 --> 00:06:59,966
BUT YOU CAN'T.

60
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:03,400
YOU SEE, MY MOTHER IS
NOT IN THIS WORLD ANY MORE.

61
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,866
SHE WAS KILLED.

62
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:09,700
AND TOKIOKA, WHO TRIED
TO PROTECT ME, DIED.

63
00:07:09,766 --> 00:07:12,700
SHIELDING ME WITH HIS BODY.

64
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,000
THE ONE WHO KILLED
THEM ALL, WAS HARRY.

65
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:19,066
IT WAS HARRY MACDOWEL.

66
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:22,866
HE'S MILLENNION'S BOSS...
HE'S KNOWN AS BLOODY HARRY.

67
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,866
MY MOM WAS KILLED BY HARRY...

68
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:52,633
- SORRY I'M LATE.

69
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:58,533
- LET'S CUT STRAIGHT
TO THE CHASE, SHALL WE?

70
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,300
I'VE JUST RECEIVED THE REPORT
THAT ORGMEN WERE KILLED.

71
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:02,966
IS THIS TRUE?

72
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:04,466
- IT'S TRUE ALL RIGHT.

73
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:08,666
THERE'S NO SURVIVORS AND
THERE'S NO WITNESSES EITHER.

74
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:10,766
THEY WERE COMPLETELY
ANNIHILATED.

75
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:14,500
- AND THOSE WERE THE SOLDIERS
YOU WERE BRAGGING ABOUT?

76
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:16,166
- YOU ARE INTIMATELY FAMILIAR

77
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,966
WITH THE EXTENT OF
THEIR ABILITIES.

78
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:20,300
SO THE ISSUE THAT
CONFRONTS US NOW,

79
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,333
IS WHO COULD POSSIBLY
BE POWERFUL ENOUGH

80
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,500
TO WIPE OUT SO MANY ORGMEN?

81
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:26,900
- COULD SUCH A HUMAN
BEING REALLY EXIST?

82
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:28,966
- WHO SAID IT HAD
TO BE HUMAN?

83
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:31,900
BESIDES, THERE'S A SINGLE CASE
ON RECORD, ISN'T THERE?

84
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:33,866
AND I BELIEVE IT DESCRIBES
SOMEONE WHO COULD

85
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:36,300
ANNIHILATE PROTOTYPE ORGMEN.

86
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:40,166
- THAT'S TRUE. BUT DIDN'T
THAT HAPPEN 13 YEARS AGO?

87
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:43,400
- THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S THE
SAME AS 13 YEARS AGO.

88
00:08:43,466 --> 00:08:44,933
- HUH?

89
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,933
- THERE IS A CROWD OF SORTS.

90
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,166
THE TYPE OF CROWD WHO
WOULD RISE AGAINST US.

91
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:53,400
WHAT WOULD WE DO THEN?
WELL, THAT'S OBVIOUS.

92
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:54,733
DESTROY THEM.

93
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,800
CRUSH THEM WITH THE POWER OF
THE MILLENNION ORGANIZATION.

94
00:08:58,866 --> 00:09:00,066
EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM.

95
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:01,266
- ( beeps )

96
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,366
- BOSS...

97
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,166
- IT'S POSSIBLE OUR
TECHNOLOGY WAS LEAKED.

98
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:09,100
BOB, PLEASE PROCEED WITH THE
INTERNAL INVESTIGATION.

99
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,166
- IT'S ALREADY BEGUN
AND I'VE ALSO SENT

100
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:13,300
RECONNAISSANCE AGENTS
TO ALL AREAS.

101
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:15,500
- WHEN YOU FIND THE SPY,
LET ME KNOW.

102
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:17,633
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

103
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,500
- THE MEETING SEEMS
TO BE OVER.

104
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:21,800
- HEY LEE, WE SHOULD
GET GOING TOO.

105
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:22,966
- SURE.

106
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:32,733
- BOSS, I FOUND THIS
AT THE MANSION

107
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,066
THAT I VISITED THE OTHER DAY.

108
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:36,266
- HMM?

109
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:38,900
HMM.

110
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:41,066
- IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

111
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:48,766
- ( laughs )

112
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,466
BRANDON HEAT...

113
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,900
WE MEET AGAIN, BRANDON.

114
00:10:03,966 --> 00:10:06,833
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT YOU
IN QUITE SOME TIME.

115
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:08,666
( laughs )

116
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,733
- Tokioka: I REALIZE
HE HAS TREMENDOUS POWER

117
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,500
IN THIS NEW BODY OF HIS.

118
00:10:29,566 --> 00:10:31,633
BUT TO GO UP AGAINST
THE ORGANIZATION

119
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,966
ALL BY HIMSELF IS INSANE.

120
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:38,200
MAYBE I AM THE WHO IS CRAZY
FOR TRYING TO HELP HIM.

121
00:10:38,966 --> 00:10:40,100
- ( gunshot )

122
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,133
- HUH?

123
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:54,800
- MOM!

124
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,600
( screaming ) MOMMY!

125
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,200
- Woman: RUN AWAY, MIKA!

126
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:03,766
RUN TO WHERE THE ORGANIZATION
CAN'T GET THEIR HANDS ON YOU.

127
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,833
GO TO HIM! RUN TO HIM, MIKA!

128
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,266
- MOMMY! MOMMY!

129
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:12,466
MOMMY!

130
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,000
( crying )

131
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:21,966
I'M WORTHLESS.
I CAN'T EVEN HIT IT.

132
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:25,933
I'LL NEVER AVENGE MY MOTHER.

133
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,600
- POOR LITTLE THING...

134
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:37,166
- ( footsteps )

135
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:52,400
- ( man humming )

136
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,633
- HUH?

137
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,466
OW, OW, OW!

138
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:03,400
- ( roars )

139
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:05,033
- ( screams )

140
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:24,066
- GUESS I NEED TO GET SOME
MORE BULLETS SOMEWHERE.

141
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:33,566
UM, EXCUSE ME.
ARE YOU FEELING OKAY?

142
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:40,600
SOMETHING WRONG?

143
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,100
WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S WRONG?

144
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,066
- Tokioka: JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE.

145
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,866
- BUT...

146
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,666
- IF HE HAD STAYED ASLEEP,
NOTHING WOULD HAVE CHANGED.

147
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:07,200
ONCE AWOKEN, HOWEVER,

148
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:10,933
HIS MIND WILL BE CONTROLLED
BY SOMETHING CALLED THE PAST

149
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,866
WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NOT.

150
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:37,200
- WAIT! WOULD YOU
PLEASE WAIT A SECOND?

151
00:13:37,266 --> 00:13:40,666
OH MAN, AT LEAST YOU COULD
ANSWER ME WHEN I TALK TO YOU.

152
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:44,200
HEY! WHERE ARE YOU
GOING, ANYWAY?

153
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,800
OH, COME ON!

154
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,433
( panting )

155
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,366
ENOUGH ALL READY.

156
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:26,766
WHERE IN THE WORLD
IS HE GOING ANYWAY?

157
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,933
COME ON, I'M INJURED.
JUST IN CASE YOU CARE.

158
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,466
I MEAN, I KNOW I AM THE ONE WHO
DECIDED TO FOLLOW HIM, BUT...

159
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,866
HUH?

160
00:14:57,466 --> 00:15:00,566
- ( grunts in pain )

161
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:15,033
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

162
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:51,066
ARE THESE ALL GRAVES,
OF SOMEONE YOU KNOW?

163
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:59,200
WELL, I GUESS THOSE PEOPLE
MUST HAVE BEEN DEAR TO YOU.

164
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,800
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT...

165
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:16,333
AFTER THE ORGANIZATION
TOOK MY MOM AWAY FROM ME,

166
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,866
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS

167
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:20,400
GETTING BACK AT BLOODY HARRY
FOR KILLING HER.

168
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:23,633
I FORGOT ABOUT BURYING HER.

169
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,033
MY OWN MOTHER.

170
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:26,833
( sobs )

171
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:31,066
I'M SO SORRY...

172
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:37,700
- ( rumbling )

173
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:39,533
- HUH?

174
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:46,600
NO, THAT'S WAY TOO BIG.

175
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,000
- ( grunting )

176
00:17:10,566 --> 00:17:12,066
- WHAT IS THAT?

177
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,200
- ( screams )

178
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:32,933
- ( beeping )

179
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,366
- ( gasps )

180
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:35,633
THIS MEANS...

181
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,033
- All: HUH?

182
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,800
- ( all gasp )

183
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,933
- ( soft growling )

184
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,966
- ( scoffs )

185
00:18:43,266 --> 00:18:46,866
- ( growling )

186
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,333
- WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THAT?

187
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:02,033
- ( growls )

188
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,400
- GRAVE!

189
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:27,600
- ( gasps )

190
00:19:46,366 --> 00:19:48,400
- WELL, GRAVE, GONNA FIGHT?

191
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,400
- ( roars )

192
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,233
- ( roaring )

193
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,866
- ( gasps )

194
00:20:55,566 --> 00:20:56,600
- MARIA...

195
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,900
MARIA!

196
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:17,233
- ( screams )

197
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:31,866
- WHAT? SHE GOT AWAY?
WHERE WAS THE DEATH SQUAD?

198
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:33,400
WE ADDED ORGMEN TO THE SQUAD

199
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:36,333
SO THAT THEY'D BE FULLY
PREPARED, DIDN'T WE?

200
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,933
- ( man over phone ) IT SEEMS
THE GIRL HAD A BODYGUARD.

201
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,866
- WHAT KIND OF BODYGUARD?

202
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,733
- I WENT AHEAD AND
FORWARDED YOU THE DATA

203
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,766
THAT BOB HAS BEEN
ABLE TO EXTRACT

204
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,100
FROM THE MEMORY
OF THE FALLEN ORGMEN.

205
00:21:49,033 --> 00:21:51,833
BOSS, YOU BETTER
GET READY FOR THIS.

206
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,566
WHAT BOB FOUND
IS VERY SURPRISING.

207
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,766
- ( gasps )

208
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,100
( laughing )

209
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:18,866
I SEE...
SO, YOU ARE ALIVE, BRANDON?

210
00:22:20,433 --> 00:22:25,933
WELL, ARE YOU GOING TO BETRAY
ME ONCE AGAIN, BRANDON?

211
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:31,633
IF SO, I'LL KILL YOU OVER
AND OVER AGAIN!

212
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,666
I'LL DESTROY YOU FOREVER!

213
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:46,666
- ( pop music playing )

214
00:22:57,266 --> 00:22:59,333
- ( man singing )

215
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:16,266
- Brandon:
THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION.

216
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,000
A PLACE WHERE YOU LIVE
WITH DEATH EVERYDAY.

217
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:21,900
THERE IS NO FUTURE THERE.
NO HOPE.

218
00:24:21,966 --> 00:24:24,866
AND YET, I WAS FINE.

219
00:24:24,933 --> 00:24:28,033
BACK THEN,
I HAD NO PROBLEM WITH THAT.
