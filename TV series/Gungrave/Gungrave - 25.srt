- ( theme music playing )

2
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:12,566
- Harry: THEY WANT ME DEAD.

3
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,766
THEY'VE ALREADY SEIZED
MY HIDDEN BANK ACCOUNTS,

4
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:17,400
AND NOW THE BASTARDS ARE 
TEARING MY MANSION APART.

5
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:21,166
SHERRY...

6
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:25,033
STILL...

7
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,966
I AM MILLENNION.

8
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:37,533
- ( exhales )

9
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:41,633
( groans )

10
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,700
( breathes deep )

11
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,400
- TIME TO WAKE UP,
ORGMEN.

12
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:32,833
IT'S TIME TO WIPE OUT
THE TRAITORS.

13
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,300
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

14
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:35,700
I TAKE WHAT I WANT.

15
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:39,000
AND WHATEVER I TAKE,

16
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:41,200
I CAN CHOOSE TO GIVE BACK!

17
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,000
DAMN RIGHT.

18
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:52,666
KNOW WHY?

19
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,766
BECAUSE I'M HARRY MACDOWEL!

20
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,066
( laughs )

21
00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:03,000
- SO THIS IS ONE OF
THE SPECIAL ANTI-ORGMEN BULLETS?

22
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:04,466
- YES, SIR.

23
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:05,866
A DIRECT HIT

24
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:07,733
WILL SCRAMBLE
THE ORGMEN'S PROGRAMMING

25
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,466
INTO USELESS BINARY FRAGMENTS

26
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:11,133
LEAVING IT
POWERLESS TO FIGHT

27
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,266
OR TO DEFEND ITSELF.
- SAVE THE SALE'S PITCH.

28
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,300
- UH.

29
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:15,533
- TELL ME,

30
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,666
WILL THIS DESTROY
AN ORGMEN OR WON'T IT?

31
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,600
- YES, SIR.

32
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,433
WE'VE ALREADY MANUFACTURED
OVER 6,000 ROUNDS

33
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,366
AND DISTRIBUTED THEM AMONG
SEVERAL OF THE MAJOR PLAYERS.

34
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:26,700
- VERY WELL.

35
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,900
- AMAZING THAT
THIS LITTLE BULLET

36
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:32,033
WILL DESTROY AN ORGMEN THAT
WE ONCE CONSIDERED INVINCIBLE.

37
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,833
- THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST,

38
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,033
THE STRONG BEING VANQUISHED
BY THE STRONGER,

39
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,900
IS ALWAYS PART OF THE TRANSITION
FROM ONE AGE TO ANOTHER.

40
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:41,900
- THE AGE OF HARRY MACDOWEL
IS OVER.

41
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,566
- PROSPERITY TO
THE NEW MILLENNION.

42
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,333
- ( church organ playing )

43
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:02,566
- NO ONE ELSE THEN?

44
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:05,500
YOU'LL BE ATTENDING
THE SERVICE ALONE? 

45
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:07,433
- THAT'S RIGHT.

46
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:11,000
- I SEE.

47
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:14,733
- Harry: SHERRY,

48
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,133
REST ASSURED,

49
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,066
I'LL GO ON BEING
WHO I'VE ALWAYS BEEN,

50
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:21,700
HARRY MACDOWEL
OF MILLENNION.

51

- ( gunfire )

52
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:30,800

- ( Mika panting )

56
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:02,833
GRAVE.

57
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,266
- WHO ARE YOU?

58
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,266
YOU MIND TELLING ME
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE?

59
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,266
- I-- I'M A...

60
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,133
- HUH?
IT'S THE GIRL.

61
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,133
THE ONE HEADQUARTERS
TOLD US TO--

62
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,533
- ( gasps )
- HOLD IT.

63
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,933
- SIR.
- SIR.

64
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,466
- ( gasps )

65
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:22,466
- MISS MIKA ASAGI,
I PRESUME.

66
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:24,466
BIG DADDY'S CHILD.

67
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:26,200
THAT'S WHO YOU ARE,
RIGHT?

68
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:31,500
HARRY MACDOWEL,
OUR FORMER BOSS

69
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:33,166
AND THE MAN WHO
ORDERED YOUR DEATH,

70
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:35,900
HAS BEEN EXPELLED
FROM THE ORGANIZATION.

71
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:37,500
- HUH?

72
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:40,166
- HE'S THE ONE WE'RE AFTER,
MISS ASAGI, NOT YOU.

73
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,133
YOU'VE NOTHING
TO FEAR FROM US.

74
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,400
YOU'RE FREE NOW.

75
00:06:45,366 --> 00:06:46,633
- I'M FREE?

76
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,033
- YES.

77
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,600
- JUST LIKE THAT?  FREE.

78
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:51,633
- HMM.

79
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,966
- IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

80
00:06:55,033 --> 00:06:57,166
WHAT ABOUT ALL
THE PEOPLE WHO DIED?

81
00:06:57,233 --> 00:06:59,833
MOM, DAD,

82
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,366
MR. TOKIOKA
AND DR. TOKIOKA,

83
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:03,766
WIDGE AND GARY.

84
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,366
WHAT DOES "FREE"
MEAN TO THEM?

85
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:07,466
THEY ALL DIED FOR NOTHING!

86
00:07:08,866 --> 00:07:10,866
- WE UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU FEEL, MISS.

87
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:13,200
BUT WE WON'T APOLOGIZE.

88
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,466
A CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP
ALSO CHANGES THE WAY

89
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:17,533
AN ORGANIZATION
DOES BUSINESS. 

90
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,200
YOU WERE IN THE WRONG PLACE
AT THE WRONG TIME.

91
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:22,500
A TWIST OF FATE,
NOTHING MORE, MISS.

92
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:23,866
- ( gasps )

93
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:25,200
- YOUNG LADY,

94
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:27,733
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS
OUR FORMER BOSS BIG DADDY

95
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,533
WENT OUT OF HIS WAY
TO TAKE CARE OF ME.

96
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,133
HIS KINDNESS MEANT 
A GREAT DEAL TO ME.

97
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,066
I OWE HIM
A DEBT OF GRATITUDE,

98
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:37,866
AND IT'S TIME I STARTED
PAYING IT BACK.

99
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:40,566
SO IF I CAN BE OF HELP
IN ANY WAY,

100
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:42,900
PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

101
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:44,600
- IT'S TOO LATE.

102
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,100
HELP ME FIND HIM.

103
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,133
- HUH?

104
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,233
- THE MAN...

105
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,233
THEY CALL "BEYOND THE GRAVE."

106
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,133
( sighs )

107
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
BUT HIS NAME'S BRANDON.

108
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:01,233
BRANDON HEAT.

109
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,533
THE ONLY FAMILY
I'VE GOT.

110
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:09,900
- Harry:
I'M NOT FINISHED YET.

111
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:11,200
YOU'LL SEE.

112
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:18,933
YOU DIDN'T TAKE ME SERIOUSLY,
DID YOU?

113
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,433
WELL, NOW YOU'RE
GONNA FIND OUT

114
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,933
WHO THE REAL BOSS IS.

115
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,200
- ( Orgmen groans )
- HUH?

116

( grunts )

122
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:45,666

- ( exhales )

126
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,700
CALL HEADQUARTERS NOW!

127
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,933
- Harry: ORGMEN...

128
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:05,266
MY ORGMEN...

129
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,300
SHIT.

130
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:15,566
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?

131
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:36,033
HUH?

- DAMN IT.

135
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:00,666
WHAT'S GOING ON?

136
00:10:15,766 --> 00:10:17,366
WHERE DID I GO WRONG?

137
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:20,266
WHERE THE HELL 
DID I GO WRONG?

138
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,033
HOW IN THE WORLD...

139
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,033
( gasps )

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,333
- ( crashing )

141

- BRANDON.

142

- HARRY.

143
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,666

HARRY.

HARRY MACDOWEL.

148

( exhales )

151
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,800
- UNBELIEVABLE.

152
00:11:45,866 --> 00:11:48,333
TWO AND THREE,
TWO AND THREE!

153
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,733
IT WAS OBVIOUS.

154
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,666
ANYONE COULD HAVE GUESSED
WHO WAS GONNA WIN THAT RACE.

155
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:53,100
IT WAS A SURE THING.

156
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,000
IT WAS BAD ENOUGH
THAT NATHAN SNUCK OFF

157
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:56,200
WITH MY GAMBLING DOUGH,

158
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:57,466
BUT FOR HIM TO BLOW
THE WHOLE THING

159
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:58,600
BETTING THE TWO-FIVE,

160
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,333
NOW THAT WAS
UN-FREAKING-BELIEVABLE.

161
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,133
I'M TELLING YOU, MAN,
THE GUY'S HOPELESS.

162
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,800
- ( woman screams )

163
00:12:03,866 --> 00:12:05,800
- ( men laugh )
- STOP. STOP IT!

164
00:12:05,866 --> 00:12:07,166
- AW, COME ON, CUTIE PIE.

165
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:08,633
DON'T BE SO ANTISOCIAL.

166
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,166
- ( cries )
LET GO OF ME!

167
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:12,433
- DON'T GET INVOLVED.

168
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,933
- HUH?

169
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,333
- WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO?

170
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,833
IN THIS TOWN, PEOPLE GOTTA LEARN
TO DEAL WITH THEIR OWN PROBLEMS.

171
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,966
THE LUCKY ONES WILL MAKE IT,
AND THE UNLUCKY ONES WON'T,

172
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:22,433
WHETHER YOU HELP THEM
OR NOT, RIGHT?

173
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,066
- HMM.

174
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:25,433
- ( chuckles )

175
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,166
- ( exhales )
- UH?

176
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:29,166
BRANDON, WAIT!
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

177
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:30,833
COME BACK HERE.

178
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,400
HOPELESS, COMPLETELY 
AND UTTERLY HOPELESS.

179
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:34,533
( sighs )

180
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,200
- ( men laughing )
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

181
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:39,400
- THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT, MISSY.
- STOP IT.

182
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:41,733
- SWEET LITTLE THING
ALL BY YOURSELF,

183
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,400
STRUTTING YOUR STUFF.

184
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:45,000
- HEY, LOOSEN UP, BABY.
- OH YEAH.

185
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:46,800
- BEEN A WHILE SINCE
WE GOT LUCKY,

186
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,800
BUT TONIGHT
WE HIT THE JACKPOT.

187
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:50,133
( chuckles )

188
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,333
HEY, CHILL OUT.

189
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,066
YOU'LL GET YOUR TURN
AFTER I'M DONE.

190
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:54,466
- HUH?

191
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:56,000
- CHILL, I SAID!

192
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:56,966
HUH?

193
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,166
UH...

194
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:03,033
( grunting )

195
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,400
- ( grunts )

196
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:05,600
- ( screams )

197
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,166
WHOA!

198
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:08,400
- HELP!

199
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:10,033
- ( all grunting )

200
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:14,433
- HOW CAN I THANK YOU
FOR SAVING ME LIKE THAT?

201
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,700
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

202
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:16,833
- HOLD ON.

203
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,433
I'M NOT THE ONE
TO THANK FOR THAT.

204
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,766
YOUR KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR
IS MR. BUTTINSKY HERE.

205
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:22,766
- OH.

206
00:13:24,866 --> 00:13:26,066
( chuckles )

207
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:28,000
- OH.

208
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,500
- HUH?

209
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:36,866
( chuckles )

210
00:13:38,966 --> 00:13:40,800
- WHAT?  ARE YOU SERIOUS?

211
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:43,566
BRANDON HAS A CRUSH ON HER?
ARE YOU SURE, HARRY?

212
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:46,466
- YEP.  ABSOLUTELY
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

213
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:47,933
IT WAS LOVE
AT FIRST SIGHT.

214
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,933
- YOU'RE IN LOVE?

215
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,266
- COME ON, FESS UP, PAL.

216
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,933
HARRY'S AN EXPERT
ON WOMEN AND LOVE

217
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,800
AND ALL THAT STUFF.

218
00:13:56,866 --> 00:13:57,900
MIGHT AS WELL ADMIT IT.

219
00:13:57,966 --> 00:13:59,266
- ( sighs )

220
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,400
- ( chuckles )

221
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:02,266
- TELL ME,
JUST WHO IS SHE?

222
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,300
WHAT'S SHE LIKE?

223
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:04,600
- HER NAME IS MARIA.

224
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,600
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL AND GRACEFUL.

225
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:07,933
KIND OF SLIM.

226
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,166
MY AGE OR OLDER.

227
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:10,500
- Both: YOU DON'T SAY?

228
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:12,166
- HOW DO YOU THINK
SHE FEELS, HARRY? 

229
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:14,000
- MY GUT FEELING IS...

230
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:16,000
IF HE'S NICE TO HER,
IF HE DOESN'T GIVE UP,

231
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:17,866
YEAH, I THINK SHE'LL
GO OUT WITH HIM.

232
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:19,533
- Both: SHE WILL?!

233
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,633
- ASK HER OUT,
YOU HEAR ME?! 

234
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,566
( groans ) DIDN'T YOU HEAR
WHAT HARRY SAID?

235
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:25,900
YOU GOT A CHANCE WITH THIS GIRL.
- KENNY, TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF.

236
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,566
- SHE LIKES YOU.
SHE'LL GO ON A DATE WITH YOU.

237
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:28,766
- COME ON, KENNY.
- ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS ASK!

238
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,100
- EXCUSE ME?
- All: HMM?

239
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:35,300
- UM, SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

240
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:36,633
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

241
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,966
I, UH--

242
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:39,100
WELL...

243
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,766
THIS IS FOR YOU, BRANDON.

244
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,166
- HUH?

245
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:44,300
- I BAKED YOU A PIE
TO THANK YOU

246
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:45,900
FOR YOUR HELP THAT NIGHT.

247
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:47,233
IF YOU'D LIKE,

248
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,666
I'M SURE THERE'S ENOUGH
FOR EVERYONE.

249
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:52,000
- UH...

250
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:53,300
YEAH.

251
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,766
- HMM.

252
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,000
YOU SEE?

253
00:14:58,066 --> 00:15:00,366
- Both: BINGO!
- HUH?

254
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,800
UH...

255
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:11,200
- WELL?
- TOO FAR AWAY TO TELL.

256
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:12,500
- LET'S GET CLOSER.

257
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:21,300
- IT'S A LOVELY DAY.

258
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,100
- YEAH.
- ( chuckles )

259
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,300
- WHAT'S HE WAITING FOR?
SHE WANTS HIM TO KISS HER.

260
00:15:27,366 --> 00:15:28,800
ANY FOOL CAN SEE THAT.
- ( gasps )

261
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:30,133
- KISS HER, WILL YOU?

262
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,466
( kisses )

263
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:33,466
- KENNY...

264
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,366
- BRANDON WILL
HANDLE IT HIS WAY.

265
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:37,033
- All: HMM?
- HE HAS HIS OWN STYLE,

266
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,633
HIS OWN WAY
OF DOING THINGS.

267
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,166
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO
BE LIKE US OR ANYONE ELSE.

268
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,000
- HE'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.

269
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,200
- BRANDON'S JUST BRANDON.
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

270
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,800
- ( whistles )

271
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:31,366
- ( grunts )

272
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,700
I'M AFRAID WE DIDN'T
MAKE MUCH OF A PROFIT TODAY.

273
00:16:35,766 --> 00:16:37,666
THIS IS ALL I COULD GET.

274
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,300
( sighs )

275
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:42,600
HERE YOU GO.

276
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,233
- ( both chew )

277
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,866
- HEY, BRANDON?

278
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,100
TELL ME SOMETHING.

279
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,066
WHY DON'T YOU GET YOURSELF
A REAL JOB?

280
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:05,766
THAT OLD MAN, 
MARIA'S UNCLE,

281
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:06,933
DOESN'T LIKE US.

282
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,566
IF YOU'RE REAL SERIOUS
ABOUT MARIA,

283
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:11,133
REINVENT YOURSELF.

284
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,000
GET YOURSELF 
A DECENT JOB.

285
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,466
LEAD AN HONEST LIFE.

286
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,466
YOU CAN DO IT, BRANDON.

287
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,133
- AND YOU?

288
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,800
- WHO, ME?

289
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:23,000
( chuckles )

290
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:25,533
NO, THANKS.
I LIKE MY LIFE JUST FINE.

291
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,866
I'LL TEAM UP WITH
KENNY AND THE OTHER GUYS,

292
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:30,066
PULL A FEW JOBS,
DAZZLE THE LADIES,

293
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,400
AND CON THEM
OUT OF THEIR MONEY.

294
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:32,733
THE USUAL STUFF.

295
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,466
SO WHAT IF THEY
CALL US PUNKS. 

296
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:36,566
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY'RE RIGHT.

297
00:17:36,633 --> 00:17:38,800
I DON'T CARE.

298
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:41,000
I'M FREE.

299
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,566
AND THAT'S FINE WITH ME.

300
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:47,500
YES, SIR.

301
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,800
JUST FINE.

302
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,900
- ME TOO.
- HMM?

303
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:57,600
- I'M FINE WITH
THE WAY THINGS ARE.

304
00:17:59,366 --> 00:18:00,833
- ( sighs )

305
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,666
( chuckles )

306
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:06,466
I GUESS MARIA'S IN
FOR ONE HELL OF A RIDE.

307
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,466
- ( all laughing )

308
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,666
- IT'S TRUE.
HE'D NEVER DONE IT.

309
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:14,600
HE HAD NO IDEA WHERE
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO.

310
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:15,800
- ( all laugh )

311
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:18,200
- BUT HE ACTS LIKE
HE'S REAL COOL AND SAYS

312
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:19,733
"DON'T MAKE ME
COME OVER THERE."

313
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,800
I SURE HOPE NOT!

314
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,866
- ( spits, laughs )

315
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:24,466
- WHAT A WEIRDO.
- REAL TOUGH GUY.

316
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:26,533
- HEY, YOU GUYS HUNGRY?
WELL?

317
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,200
- PROBLEM IS, HE'S 5'3"

318
00:18:28,266 --> 00:18:29,200
AND COULDN'T PUNCH HIS WAY
THROUGH A STRONG WIND.

319
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:30,300
- THAT WAS SO DAMN FUNNY.

320
00:18:30,366 --> 00:18:31,600
- ( laughing )

321
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,533
I LAUGHED SO HARD
I COULD BARELY MOVE.

322
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,200
- I HEAR YOU.
- WELL... ( sighs )

323
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,866
- HEY, WHERE YOU GOING, HARRY?

324
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:38,200
WHY YOU LEAVING SO EARLY?

325
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:39,933
BECAUSE YOU MADE ME
LAUGH SO DAMN HARD,

326
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,266
IT GAVE ME A HEADACHE.

327
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,033
I'LL CATCH YOU 
LOWLIFES LATER.

328
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,533
- HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

329
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,233
YOU DRINK TOO MUCH
OR SOMETHING?

330
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,033
- THESE ARE NON-ALCOHOLIC

- DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM,
ALL RIGHT?

347

HE'S JUST GOT
A LOT OF HOT AIR,

348
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:06,966
AND HIS GUYS ARE NOTHING.

OH...

356
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:06,000

- Grave: WERE WE WRONG?

367
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,900
DID WE MAKE THE WRONG
DECISION AFTER ALL?

368
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:21,900
I CAN'T SEEM TO REMEMBER

369
00:24:21,966 --> 00:24:24,900
WHEN THINGS STARTED TO
TAKE A TURN FOR THE WORSE.

370
00:24:24,966 --> 00:24:27,900
IN THE END,
IT TURNED OUT LIKE THIS.

371

STILL.
