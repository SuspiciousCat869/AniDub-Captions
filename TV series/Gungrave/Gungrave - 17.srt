1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,966
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,566
- GOVERNOR, WHEN WE RETURN
TO THE HOTEL,

3
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:00,733
YOU HAVE A MEETING SCHEDULED
WITH MR. MILLER

4
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,400
- OF THE SAFETY COMMISSION.
- I KNOW.

5
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:05,400
IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE BILL
I'M SUBMITTING BE PASSED

6
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:07,600
AT THE NEXT SESSION
OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY.

7
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:10,833
IT'S THE KEY TO BRINGING THE
CRIMINAL ELEMENT UNDER CONTROL.

8
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,300
- ( tires screeching )
- HMM?

9
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,033
- ( snarling )

10
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,866
- ( snarling )

11
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,333
- ( bullets ricochet )

12
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,033
- ( screams )

13
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:54,166
- ( groans )

14
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:56,233
- WHAT IS THAT THING?
- ( screaming )

15
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:13,100
- ( snarls )

16
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,733
- Man on TV: The highway here
was completely destroyed.

17
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,733
According to the city
Safety Commission,

18
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,866
this catastrophe was caused
by an undetected structural flaw

19
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:25,700
leading to the collapse
of the highway support column.

20
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,866
Ten people were involved
in the incident,

21
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:30,600
including the state governor
Svart Lukeson.

22
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,066
- AS YOU'VE SEEN,
THE ORGMEN WE DISPATCHED

23
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:35,166
COMPLETED HIS MISSION
SUCCESSFULLY.

24
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:37,466
NOW OUR SUPPORTERS
IN THE OPPOSITION PARTY

25
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:38,833
CAN EXPAND THEIR POWER BASE

26
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,100
AND EVENTUALLY GAIN CONTROL
OF THE ASSEMBLY.

27
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,966
MILLENNION WILL GROW BIGGER
AND STRONGER THAN EVER.

28
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:47,133
AND THE PERSON AT THE VERY
TOP OF THE LADDER,

29
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,500
BOSS, IT'LL BE YOU.

30
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,566
- LEE, LOOK AT THIS VIEW.

31
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,966
EVERYTHING WE CAN
SEE IS MINE.

32
00:03:58,033 --> 00:03:59,966
I'M CLOSE.

33
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:03,333
VERY CLOSE TO HAVING THE KIND OF
FREEDOM I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED OF.

34
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,666
THE FREEDOM TO GIVE AND TAKE
AS MUCH AS I WANT,

35
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:08,200
WHENEVER I WANT.

36
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:11,000
- BOSS, YOU ALREADY
HAVE THAT FREEDOM.

37
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:13,600
- NO, IT'S NOT ENOUGH,
NOT YET.

38
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,400
TO HAVE THAT KIND OF FREEDOM,

39
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:18,066
I NEED TO CLIMB TO A MUCH
HIGHER PLACE THAN THIS.

40
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:22,433
AND I WILL BECAUSE
FOR HARRY MACDOWEL,

41
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,533
FREEDOM IS THE MOST PRECIOUS
THING THERE IS.

42
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:31,733
- Man: THOSE CRATES REPRESENT
A 400 MILLION YULE OF PROFIT.

43
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,366
- WISH I COULD BE THERE
WHEN WHOEVER'S GETTING THEM

44
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:37,166
SEES WHAT'S IN 'EM.  THEY'RE
GONNA BE TOTALLY SPEECHLESS.

45
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:38,700
- YEAH, THEY SHOULD BE,

46
00:04:38,766 --> 00:04:41,200
CONSIDERING THAT THERE ARE
200 ORGMEN INSIDE.

47
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:43,333
- SO WHERE TO THIS TIME?

48
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,166
- THE MIDDLE EAST.
THE MORE THEY FIGHT,

49
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:46,466
THE MORE ORGMEN THEY NEED.

50
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:48,833
FOR MILLENNION, THAT PLACE
IS A GOLD MINE.

51
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,900
- YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

52
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:53,066
HOW MUCH THE ORGANIZATION
IS MAKING A YEAR?

53
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:55,866
- NOPE.
- 23 BILLION YULE.

54
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:59,466
- REALLY?  THAT'S ALMOST
AS MUCH AS THE NATIONAL BUDGET.

55
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:02,033
- HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE BOSS IS GOING TO DO

56
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,466
WITH ALL THAT MONEY?

57
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:06,100
- MAYBE HE'S PLANNING
TO BUY THE MOON OR SOMETHING.

58
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,700
- ( all laughing )

59
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,100
- IF ANYONE COULD DO IT,
IT'S THE BOSS.

60
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,266
HE IS BLOODY HARRY AFTER ALL.
- ( gunshot )

61
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,166
- ( gasps )

62
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:20,066
- YOU TALK TOO MUCH.

63
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,333
- WE'RE REALLY SORRY, SIR.

64
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,166
- NOW GET BACK TO WORK.
- Both: YES, SIR!

65
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:34,966
- MILLENNION'S GOTTEN SO BIG
IT'S DRAINED THE TALENT POOL.

66
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:37,466
MOST OF THESE ROOKIES
ARE USELESS.

67
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:45,466
- HOW MANY ORGMEN CAN WE PRODUCE
AT FULL CAPACITY?

68
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:47,600
- APPROXIMATELY 400 PER MONTH.

69
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:51,033
- THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.  CAN'T YOU
RAISE THE PRODUCTION RATE?

70
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,766
- ORGMENIZATION WILL SUCCEED
ONLY WHEN THE SUBJECT

71
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,233
CAN WITHSTAND THE EXCRUCIATING
PAIN OF BEING TRANSMUTED

72
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,866
FROM ONE PHYSICAL ENTITY
INTO ANOTHER.

73
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:02,600
IF CURRENT PRODUCTION LEVELS
AREN'T SATISFACTORY,

74
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,333
YOU'LL NEED TO PROVIDE ME
WITH BETTER PHYSICAL SPECIMENS

75
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,466
TO WORK WITH.
- I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

76
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,233
- WHAT ABOUT
THE SUPERIORIZATION PROCESS?

77
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,600
- WE'VE LEARNED THAT
SUPERIORIZATION REQUIRES

78
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,266
THE QUALITIES OF NOT ONLY
GREAT PHYSICAL STRENGTH,

79
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,733
BUT ALSO EXTREME MENTAL ACUITY.

80
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,066
SIMILAR IN FACT
TO THE ATTRIBUTES POSSESSED

81
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:24,233
BY ONE OF YOUR TOP EXECUTIVES.
BALLADBIRD LEE.

82
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,633
ON TOP OF THAT--
- ( grunting )

83
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,733
- ARE YOU OKAY?

84
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,666
- I'M SORRY, BEAR.
IT'S JUST THAT I STILL

85
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:38,400
HAVEN'T LEARNED HOW
TO CONTROL EVERYTHING YET.

86
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:39,833
WHOA.

87
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,133
- ( laughing )

88
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,233
WONDERFUL.  AN ORGMEN
WHO CAN THINK FOR HIMSELF.

89
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,933
BOB HERE IS A SUPERIOR,
YOU SEE.

90
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,466
- ORGMEN.  SUPERIOR.

91
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:00,400
THEY ARE THE DEVIL'S WORK.

92
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:02,233
AND IN HELPING TO CREATE THEM,

93
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,633
I BECAME RESPONSIBLE
FOR THEIR ACTIONS.

94
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,433
BIG DADDY,
IF YOU COULD SEE ME NOW,

95
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,066
YOU'D PROBABLY LAUGH

96
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:13,966
AND WONDER HOW I GOT MYSELF
INTO THIS MESS.

97
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,266
EVERYTHING I'VE DONE,

98
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,766
IS FOR MY DAUGHTER.

99
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,733
FOR SHERRY.

100
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,366
- IS IT ALL READY?
- YES, SIR.

101
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:27,433
AS USUAL, WE'VE GATHERED
THE CANDIDATES WHO FAILED

102
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,466
TO REACH THE MINIMUM LEVEL
OF PHYSICAL CONDITIONING

103
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,133
NEEDED FOR ORGANIZATION.

104
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,166
- WELL DONE.
NOW OPEN THE DOOR, PLEASE.

105
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:38,900
- MR. LEE,
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

106
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:40,133
IS IT REALLY NECESSARY?

107
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,233
- NECESSARY?
A SILLY QUESTION.

108
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,300
BUT I'LL ANSWER YOU ANYWAY.

109
00:07:44,366 --> 00:07:45,933
TO KEEP UP
WITH HARRY MACDOWEL,

110
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,233
I HAVE TO RID MYSELF
OF EMOTIONAL WEAKNESS.

111
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,400
I HAVE TO STAY AS SHARP
AND AS MERCILESS AS HE IS.

112
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:56,300
IT'S NOT EASY.
IT TAKES A LOT OF PRACTICE.

113
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,933
( laughing )

114
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,166
- ( gasping )

115
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,166
- ( laughing )
- ( slashing )

116
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:09,166
- ( screaming )

117
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:12,566
- OPEN THIS DOOR.
YOU HEAR ME?  OPEN IT!

118
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:16,100
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!
- ( screaming )

119
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,300
- HELP ME!  PLEASE HELP ME!

120
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,166
- LOOK, HARRY'S BACK.
HI, HARRY.

121
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:27,666
- ( clamoring )
- HEY, YOU GUYS.

122
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:30,966
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.
- DID YOU BRING US ANY PRESENTS?

123
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:33,866
DID YOU?  DID YOU?
- I THINK I HAVE SOME PRESENTS

124
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:35,300
HERE SOMEWHERE.

125
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:37,266
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I BROUGHT
YOU EVERYTHING YOU ASKED ME FOR

126
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,866
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU.

127
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
- Sherry:
HE HAS SUCH ENORMOUS POWER.

128
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:48,000
YET, HE'S STILL SO SWEET
AND SO KIND.

129
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:49,833
OH, HARRY.

130
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,100
MY WONDERFUL HARRY MACDOWEL.

131
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,900
- ( laughs )

132
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:33,500
- Harry: SORRY.
THAT'S A DEAL BREAKER.

133
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:35,333
SO YOU'LL SIMPLY DELETE IT
FROM THE CONTRACT.

134
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,033
I'M SURE YOUR BOARD
WILL ACCEPT OUR OFFER,

135
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,533
BUT I STILL THINK
I SHOULD REMIND YOU

136
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,933
THAT REJECTION
IS NOT AN OPTION.

137
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,500
YOU SIMPLY HAVE NO CHOICE
IN THE MATTER.

138
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:44,133
DO WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING?

139
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,066
UNLESS OF COURSE YOU WANT
TO FOLLOW IN THE FOOTSTEPS

140
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:48,066
OF OUR DEAR DEPARTED GOVERNOR.

141
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:50,666
( laughs )

142
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:52,700
EXCELLENT.

143
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:56,766
I LOOK FORWARD
TO HEARING FROM YOU.

144
00:09:56,833 --> 00:10:00,066
- SIR, I'VE GOT
SOME NEWS FOR YOU.

145
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:03,100
- ( whispering )

146
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:08,700
- MARIA.  HMM.

147
00:10:08,766 --> 00:10:12,066
MARIA.  MARIA.

148
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:15,133
OH, THAT MARIA.
OF COURSE.

149
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,266
AND SHE HAS A LITTLE GIRL
TO KEEP HER COMPANY.

150
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,300
- THAT'S WONDERFUL.
- WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO?

151
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:21,966
BIG DADDY'S DAUGHTER.

152
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:25,300
WELL, WE WOULDN'T WANT
TO DISPUTE OVER WHO SUCCEEDS ME.

153
00:10:25,366 --> 00:10:26,900
WHY DON'T WE LET
RINGO HANDLE IT?

154
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:29,466
- RIGHT.
WHATEVER YOU SAY, BOSS.

155
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,166
- SO FINALLY,

156
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:45,933
I'LL BE RID OF EVERYTHING THAT
REMINDS ME OF THE OLD MAN.

157
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:05,900
- HEY, MOM, I'M HOME.

158
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:11,666
- Maria:
WELCOME HOME, MIKA.

159
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:19,900
- HOW WAS SCHOOL TODAY?

160
00:11:19,966 --> 00:11:21,933
- NOTHING SPECIAL, REALLY.
SAME OLD THING.

161
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,900
SCHOOL STUFF, YOU KNOW?
- YEAH, I KNOW.

162
00:11:24,966 --> 00:11:26,633
SO TO YOU,
NOTHING SPECIAL MEANS

163
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,400
HAVING A NORMAL
EVERYDAY LIFE.

164
00:11:28,466 --> 00:11:32,333
THAT'S ALL I WANT.
- Both: A NORMAL EVERYDAY LIFE.

165
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,500
- ( laughing )

166
00:11:35,766 --> 00:11:38,166
- WE BOTH FEEL EXACTLY
THE SAME WAY, MOM.

167
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:40,733
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

168
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,266
- GOOD EVENING, MADAME.
MISS MIKA.

169
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,833
MAY I SERVE SOME
FRESHLY BREWED TEA?

170
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,000
- THAT WOULD BE LOVELY.
THANK YOU.

171
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:50,500
- IF YOU'D ASKED ME,
I WOULD HAVE MADE TEA FOR YOU.

172
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:53,666
OH.  DON'T WORRY.
I'LL FIX IT.

173
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,900
I DROPPED YOU, DAD.
SORRY.  OH!

174
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,800
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, DEAR?

175
00:12:03,866 --> 00:12:06,433
- MOM, WHO'S THIS?

176
00:12:08,366 --> 00:12:11,066
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

177
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:14,066
- NO, DEAR, IT'S JUST..
THAT MAN IN THE PICTURE

178
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:17,200
WAS A VERY GOOD FRIEND
OF MINE.

179
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:20,433
HIS NAME WAS BRANDON.

180
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,133
BRANDON HEAT.

181
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,166
- BRANDON HEAT.

182
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:26,633
BRANDON.

183
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,733
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

184
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,133
- Mika: SO YOU GUYS WERE
REALLY JUST FRIENDS?

185
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,966
WASN'T HE YOUR BOYFRIEND
BEFORE YOU MET DAD?

186
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,966
- NO, HE WASN'T.

187
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:38,200
- SO DAD WAS YOUR ONE
AND ONLY THEN, RIGHT?

188
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:41,266
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA ANSWER,
THEN THERE WAS

189
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,266
SOMETHING GOING ON
WITH THIS GUY FOR SURE.

190
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,933
- NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

191
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,333
I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT THE TWO OF THEM.

192
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,766
- MM-HMM.
IF YOU SAY SO.

193
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,266
- ( wind howling )

194
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,566
- THE WIND HAS CERTAINLY
PICKED UP OUT THERE.

195
00:12:55,633 --> 00:12:57,833
- THERE'S A STORM COMING.
IT'LL BE COLD TONIGHT.

196
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,633
- I SUPPOSE WE MIGHT EVEN
GET A LITTLE SNOW.

197
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:10,666
Maria: THIS IS OUR 13th
WINTER HERE.

198
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:13,733
AND YET, SOMEHOW IT FEELS
LIKE WE JUST ARRIVED.

199
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,900
- I'M SURE YOUR LIFE HERE

200
00:13:14,966 --> 00:13:17,166
WOULD HAVE MADE THE MASTER
VERY HAPPY.

201
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:19,833
MISS MIKA IS
GRACIOUS, HONEST AND KIND.

202
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,300
QUITE AN IMPRESSIVE
YOUNG LADY,

203
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:24,366
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

204
00:13:26,466 --> 00:13:28,500
- ( gasps )

205
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,966
MR. TOKIOKA,
PLEASE KEEP MY DAUGHTER SAFE.

206
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,766
- YOU HAVE MY WORD.

207
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,666
- YOU MADE ME A PROMISE,
REMEMBER?

208
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,833
- YES, MADAM, I UNDERSTAND.

209
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,566
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT'S WRONG, MR. TOKIOKA?

210
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:52,666
- PLEASE, MISS, WE'VE GOT
TO MOVE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

211
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:57,266
- MOM, WHY?
WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON?

212
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,633
I STILL DON'T UNDER--
HEY, THAT'S A--

213
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,800
- MIKA, YOU'VE GOT
TO GO RIGHT NOW,

214
00:14:01,866 --> 00:14:04,066
FIND A PLACE WHERE THE
ORGANIZATION CAN'T REACH YOU.

215
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:06,633
- ORGANIZATION?
WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO GO?

216
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,433
- WHEREVER HE IS.
WHEREVER HE IS, MIKA.

217
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,233
- IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
WHEREVER WHO IS?

218
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,466
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- MR. TOKIOKA, PLEASE GO NOW!

219
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:18,200
- TAKE CARE, MADAM.
- MOM, WHY?

220
00:14:18,266 --> 00:14:21,466
WHY, MOM, WHY?  MOM!

221
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:24,433
- MY DARLING,
PLEASE PROTECT MIKA.

222
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,600
STAY AT HER SIDE
AND GUIDE HER

223
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,233
TO WHEREVER BRANDON IS.

224
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,266
- ( grunts )
- ( gasps )

225
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:44,266
- ( engine turns over )

226
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,066
- MOMMY!  MOMMY!

227
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,833
MOMMY.  MOMMY.

228
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,833
MOMMY!

229
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,000
MOMMY!

230
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,833
- YOU LET THE DAUGHTER GET AWAY?
YOU DIMWITS!

231
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,900
SHE WAS THE PRIMARY TARGET.
THE BOSS SAID,

232
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:24,100
"WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T LET HER ESCAPE.

233
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,633
USE ORGMEN IF YOU HAVE TO,
BUT GET HER!"

234
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,833
- ( engines turn over )

235
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:57,600
- Maria:
MY DARLING.

236
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:04,633
PLEASE, GUIDE OUR LITTLE GIRL.

237
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:10,166
TAKE HER

238
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:13,900
TO WHERE HE IS.

239
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:23,500
- ( crying ) MOMMY.  MOMMY.

240
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,533
STOP, LET ME OUT.
PLEASE LET ME OUT.

241
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,300
I WANNA GO BACK TO MY MOM.
TAKE ME BACK TO HER.

242
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:32,133
- I CAN'T.
- WHY NOT?

243
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,800
- BECAUSE HER DEATH WILL
HAVE BEEN FOR NOTHING.

244
00:16:35,866 --> 00:16:37,666
AND I WON'T ALLOW THAT.

245
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:41,133
- DEATH?  SHE'S--

246
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,666
( wailing )
MOMMY, NO!

247
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:49,333
- MISS, PLEASE.
GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF.

248
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,266
- WHY US, MR. TOKIOKA?

249
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,066
WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES THEM
ATTACK US?

250
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:56,066
WHO WOULD DO SOMETHING
LIKE THIS?

251
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:58,600
- IT WAS MILLENNION.
THE MAFIA.

252
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,133
- THE MAFIA?
- IT WAS PROBABLY MILLENNION'S

253
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,900
BOSS HARRY MACDOWEL
WHO ORDERED THE ATTACK.

254
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:06,433
HE'S BEEN RESPONSIBLE
FOR SO MANY DEATHS

255
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,066
THAT EVEN HIS OWN MEN
CALL HIM BLOODY HARRY.

256
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:11,400
- BUT WHAT'S THE MAFIA
WANT WITH US?

257
00:17:11,466 --> 00:17:14,533
- MISS, THIS MAY BE DIFFICULT
FOR YOU TO HEAR,

258
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,133
BUT PLEASE LISTEN TO WHAT
I HAVE TO SAY.

259
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,366
YOUR FATHER WAS A MEMBER
OF THE MAFIA.

260
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:20,766
- ( gasps )

261
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,533
IT CAN'T BE TRUE.

262
00:17:28,633 --> 00:17:32,166
MY FATHER, BIG DADDY.

263
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:34,900
HE WAS THE BOSS
OF MILLENNION.

264
00:17:34,966 --> 00:17:36,400
- ( tires screeching )

265
00:17:36,466 --> 00:17:39,400
- AND IT WAS HARRY MACDOWEL...

266
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:45,466
...WHO KILLED MY MOM.

267
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:47,633
IT WAS BLOODY HARRY.

268
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,900
- MISS.
- WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME?

269
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:54,533
WHY DID YOU WAIT TILL NOW?
- IT WAS WHAT MADAME WANTED.

270
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,500
SHE THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE HAPPIER
IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW

271
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:58,500
ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION.

272
00:17:58,566 --> 00:18:00,833
- MR. TOKIOKA,
WHERE ARE WE GONNA GO?

273
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,266
WHAT'LL HAPPEN TO US?
- DON'T WORRY, MISS.

274
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,933
I KNOW A MAN
WHO CAN PROTECT YOU,

275
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,966
AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS
THAT I KNOW WHERE TO FIND HIM.

276
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:09,666
- PROTECT ME?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

277
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:12,100
YOU'RE GOING TO MEET A MAN
NAMED BRANDON HEAT.

278
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,500
- TO MEET THAT MAN.

279
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:17,766
- YES, ON 24th AVENUE
IN THE 12A DISTRICT.

280
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,266
THAT'S WHERE BRANDON HEAT
AND MY YOUNGER BROTHER

281
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,733
ARE CURRENTLY LOCATED,
BUT FIRST,

282
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,600
PLEASE HAVE A LOOK AT THE CASE
BY YOUR FEET.

283
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,466
NOW TAKE A LOOK INSIDE.

284
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:31,933
YOU HAVE TO DO WHATEVER
IS NECESSARY TO SURVIVE,

285
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,300
UNTIL YOU GET
TO MY BROTHER'S LABORATORY.

286
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,900
- I'VE NEVER USED ONE BEFORE.

287
00:18:42,366 --> 00:18:43,633
- ( gasps )

288
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:50,500
- ( growling )

289
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:52,466
- ( screaming )

290
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,333
- ( roars )

291
00:19:04,466 --> 00:19:05,800
- MR. TOKIOKA!

292
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:09,300
- ( straining )
RUN AWAY, MISS, RUN, GO ON.

293
00:19:09,366 --> 00:19:10,300
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

294
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:14,300
- GO, HURRY,
TAKE THE CASE WITH YOU.

295
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:16,133
- ALL RIGHT.

296
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,500
( grunting )

297
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,033
- ( groaning )

298
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,533
- ( snarling )

299
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,500
- STAY SAFE, MISS.

300
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:58,033
- MOMMY.  MR. TOKIOKA.

301
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,766
NOW WHAT?
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO ME?

302
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,533
I WONDER IF I'LL END UP
GETTING KILLED BY THE MAFIA.

303
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:20,600
CRYING WON'T GET
ME ANYWHERE.

304
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,600
HAVE TO GET THERE.

305
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,633
HAVE TO GET TO DISTRICT A12,

306
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,866
24th AVENUE.

307
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:31,166
HAVE TO MEET THAT PERSON.

308
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:34,666
I HAVE TO SURVIVE
UNTIL I GET THERE.

309
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,866
I HAVE TO AVENGE
MY MOTHER!

310
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,300
- WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

311
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:52,800
- HMM?

312
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,833
- THAT CASE.

313
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,333
COULD IT BE?

314
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,400
