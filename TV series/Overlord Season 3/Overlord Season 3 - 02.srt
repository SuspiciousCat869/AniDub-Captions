1
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:15,166
[AINS] I have gathered you
here to discuss our future.

2
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,375
Albedo, Overseer of the
Guardians, and Demiurge,

3
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:21,666
our greatest strategist.
I would hear your opinions.

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,250
[BOTH]
Lord.

5
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,875
[AINS] Now that we have put
my initial plans into motion,

6
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,833
tell us what doctrine
you believe Nazarick

7
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:30,833
should follow, moving forward.

8
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,750
If anyone else has an opinion,

9
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,125
you may raise your
hand to speak.

10
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,416
In order to facilitate
our discussion,

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,958
I ask that Demiurge explain
our current situation

12
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,291
in a way that
all can understand.

13
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,083
Begin with our latest operation.

14
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,541
As you wish.

15
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:51,000
[MOMONGA sighs] I may be their
leader, but I don't have

16
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,541
much experience in this
whole conquering thing.

17
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:57,833
At least this way, I can
pretend I understood the plan.

18
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,791
What I do know is that
Nazarick's survival

19
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,541
is our first priority.

20
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:04,291
Second, would be spreading
the name of Ains Ooal Gown

21
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,583
throughout the world.

22
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,916
Actually, that's
just my priority,

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,833
since I wanna find out
if any of my old friends

24
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,708
are trapped here like me.

25
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,416
But that might have
to take a backseat,

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,500
especially when we still know
so little about this world.

27
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,625
[DEMIURGE] As you've likely
heard, thanks to the efforts

28
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,500
of Mare's group,
we've subjugated

29
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,958
all the leaders
of Eight Fingers.

30
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,708
As a result, Nazarick now
has complete control

31
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:29,958
of the Re-Estize underworld.

32
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,208
[AINS]
Hm?

33
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,708
This brings us closer
to Ains' ultimate goal.

34
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:37,208
Which you all know
is world domination.

35
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:38,541
[AINS]
Mm?

36
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,333
Or I should hope you know
if you're not a fool.

37
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:46,958
[AINS]
Huh?

38
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,708
[MOMONGA]
Wait, so is that where we're at?


39
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,041
World domination?


40
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay, okay, don't freak out!


41
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,666
You've gotta act like it
was your idea, after all!

42
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,708
[gasps]

43
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,000
[MOMONGA]
Actually, world domination

44
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,166
might be a good way to
get our name out there.

45
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,708
Even if we have
a bad reputation,

46
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,833
at least people will
know who we are.

47
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,041
My friends might be a little
surprised with the direction

48
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,666
I'm taking the guild,
but whatever.

49
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,625
There will be plenty of time
to explain things later

50
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,291
and that's if I find them.

51
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,875
[AINS]
Hm?

52
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,666
[AINS]
You remembered.

53
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,416
Of course, my lord.

54
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,458
I remember every last word
you relay to me.

55
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,916
You said taking over the
world might be enjoyable.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,458
[AINS]
Yes, I recall the conversation.

57
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,583
I'm pleased to hear it.

58
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,333
[AINS]
From that one time.

59
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,000
None other, my lord.

60
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,666
[MOMONGA]
What time?!

61
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,208
[AINS] I see. Your impeccable
memory pleases me.

62
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,416
Your praise is too much.

63
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,958
[AINS] But world domination
is a complicated affair.

64
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,625
I must agree, my lord.

65
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,958
[AINS] How do you suppose
we begin our conquest?

66
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,708
I humbly suggest we announce
Nazarick to the public.

67
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:30,958
[AINS]
Hm?

68
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,541
Since the ones who
controlled Shalltear

69
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,291
are still moving
behind the scenes,

70
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,291
I fear that staying
in the shadows any further

71
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,250
will only encumber us.

72
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,125
[ALBEDO]
That's my opinion as well.

73
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,666
We can hunt them more
effectively in the open.

74
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,500
Right now, we're
wasting resources

75
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,000
trying to maintain secrecy.

76
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,750
[AINS]
Mm. An appealing proposal.

77
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,708
There is merit in
controlling the kingdom

78
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,958
from the shadows and striking
fear into the hearts

79
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:57,583
of their leaders, but in
doing so, we may force ourselves

80
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,750
to answer to the whims
of their throne.

81
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,625
That's not a pleasant prospect.

82
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,375
Frankly, I find their
leadership quite lacking.

83
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,125
Save for one individual.

84
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,250
There are other
concerns as well.

85
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,875
For example, being tied to one
kingdom limits our movements.

86
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,833
If the ones who targeted
Shalltear have more flexibility

87
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,333
than us, we would be
at a disadvantage again.

88
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,375
Therefore, Lord Ains,

89
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,416
I propose that the
Great Tomb of Nazarick

90
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,125
enter the stage of the world
as an independent nation.

91
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,916
[GUARDIANS murmur]

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,166
It appears this
came as a surprise.

93
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,083
But I assure you
Lord Ains has been

94
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,041
thinking of doing this
for a long time.

95
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,083
[GUARDIANS]
Oh!

96
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,708
[MOMONGA]
What?!

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,458
In the end,

98
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,041
I fear my intellect's rather
trifling compared to your own.

99
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,875
I won't pretend to grasp
the depth of your wisdom,

100
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:50,791
though I do hope my explanation
skims the surface accurately.

101
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,583
[AINS]
No, on the contrary,

102
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,708
you ascertained
my plans perfectly.

103
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,541
I'd expect no less
of my lead strategist.

104
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,958
[GUARDIANS]
Ah!

105
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,875
Merely observing your actions
made it crystal clear.

106
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,125
Anyone could have reached
the same conclusion.

107
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,000
[AINS]
Yes, I recall my... actions.

108
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,166
I am pleased to hear it.

109
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,625
[AINS]
From that one time.

110
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,125
None other, my lord.

111
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:15,541
[MOMONGA]
What time, damn it?!

112
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,375
[AINS] Well, of the
many actions I've taken,

113
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,916
which do you deem
the most relevant

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
to our current discussion?

115
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,458
Your accomplishments in
Carne Village come to mind.

116
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,291
[GUARDIANS gasp]

117
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,458
[AINS] I suppose that did
go rather well, didn't it?

118
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,333
At the risk of
sounding sarcastic,

119
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:36,166
you did subjugate the
village personally, my lord.

120
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,583
There's no way
it wouldn't go well.

121
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,333
I didn't know that
was you, Lord.

122
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,666
That's the human village, right?

123
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,416
Helpless humans our lord could
have eradicated with ease,

124
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,875
and yet he decided to rule
over them peacefully instead.

125
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,833
You see?

126
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,708
Lord Ains considered
that village

127
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,416
a sort of testing ground.

128
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,208
He's had conquest on his
mind long before today.

129
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,833
[GUARDIANS gasp]

130
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,416
[AINS]
Ah--

131
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,500
[KAIJALI] I haven't seen
Nphirea yet, boss.

132
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,583
Ya figure he's still sleeping?

133
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:12,916
[ENRI]
Yeah, maybe.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,625
He was up late working on
his potion last night.

135
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,208
He's missing out on
this nice weather!

136
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,333
So what's for
breakfast today, boss?

137
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,083
[laughs] Well, Kaijali,
thanks to your hard work,

138
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,625
we've got plenty of meat.

139
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,333
So I'll be whipping up
a nice and hearty stew!

140
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,500
Nice arms!

141
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,500
No!

142
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm still scrawny
compared to you.

143
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,458
Sure, but you've
got great definition!

144
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,583
I mean it!

145
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:35,916
[VILLAGE CHIEF 2A]
Good morning, Enri!

146
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,250
[ENRI]
Good morning, chief!

147
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,500
Nice weather, huh?

148
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,958
Mr. Goblin!

149
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,000
Another hard day at work?

150
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,583
You bet!

151
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,000
Can't leave all that farming to
you and your husband, now can I?

152
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,625
What would we do without you?

153
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,125
I know I've said this before,

154
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,833
but we really can't
thank you goblins enough.

155
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,250
If you weren't here
to lend a hand,

156
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,500
we'd have been forced to
abandon the village long ago.

157
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,375
I see. So we're short
on people, even now?

158
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,541
[VILLAGE CHIEF 2A]
Mm-hm. I'm afraid so.

159
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,625
Thankfully, the survivors
stuck around,

160
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,166
but we haven't been able
to bolster our numbers.

161
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,041
We've got a long way to go.

162
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,208
And the only person that
moved here from the city

163
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,791
is that ex-adventurer,
Miss Britta, right?

164
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,750
Can't blame them,
but there aren't many people

165
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,666
crazy enough to move to
a dangerous place like this.

166
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,958
What have I told you
about being negative?

167
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,041
Things will work out eventually.

168
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,375
You say that, but...

169
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,583
You remember what the
government official said.

170
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,416
We'll have lower taxes and
exemption from civil service

171
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,958
until the village can pull
itself together again.

172
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,833
It's not going to happen
overnight, and that's fine.

173
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,125
She's right. Give it
some time and I'm sure

174
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,166
that people will
want to move here.

175
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,291
We'll keep working hard
in the meantime!

176
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,666
Fair enough.

177
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,458
Lord Gown did go to the
trouble of saving our lives.

178
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,958
The least we can
do is keep living,

179
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,166
no matter how lean
the times may be.

180
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,541
Agreed! Someday,
I hope to pay him back

181
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,000
for the kindness he showed us.

182

[KAIJALI]
Wow, that's some smell.

183

Sure is.

Nphirea, we're having
breakfast soon.

185

Bring your grandmother!

186
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,041
Oh, morning, Enri!

187
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,625
You're not going
to believe this!

188
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,000
[ENRI] You're really
worked up! What happened?

189
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,166
A miracle!

190
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,791
Finally, finally I made
a brand new potion

191
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,333
and it's all my own!

192
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,458
This is going to
be revolutionary!

193
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,875
You know all those
solutions and herbs

194
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,666
I've been gathering lately?

195
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,375
Well, I finally got
the right proportions

196
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,666
and the potion turned purple!

197
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,875
Okay!

198
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,000
That's enough of that,
thank you very much.

199

[NPHIREA, ENRI]
Huh?

You're clearly high off
your own fumes, kiddo.

201
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,750
Don't worry.

202
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,583
You get breakfast going and
we'll catch up with you soon.

203
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,041
'Kay? I'll splash some
cold water over his head

204
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,125
and he'll snap out of it
in no time flat.

205
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,166
Are you sure?

206
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,208
Trust me on this.

207
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,666
All right, good luck, then!

[NPHIREA giggles]

209
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,833
You've got to pull
it together, brother.

210
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,958
[sighs] Let's be frank.

211
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,583
You're in love with
the boss, right?

212
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,166
Uh--

213

Mm-hm.

214
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,666
Then show her!

215
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,625
You're givin' all of your
love to those potions!

216
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,333
It's weird.

217
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,333
All right then. I'll try.

218
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,666
Trying ain't gonna
cut it, brother!

219
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,458
Listen, show off your strength
and she'll fall for you.

220

I'm afraid "strength"
isn't my strong point.

You got strength up here,
so work with that!

for you to make
your move, I'll pose!

Like this.

That'll be your cue

This pose, don't forget it.

And if it looks like you
should press your advantage.

I'll hit'cha with this one.

Uh, okay.

[KAIJALI]
Then I'll do this pose!

232

If that works, this one.
And then this one!

233
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,833
And after that, this!

That's right. I ate my meat

and at the bottom of the bowl,

263
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
there was more meat
waiting for me!

264
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,458
And as you all know,
that's one more piece

than the allotted amount!

it must be love!

You probably broke
one big piece in two!

Also, did anyone here
witness the first piece?

Perhaps it was actually
just a bite of potato

Ah.

318
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,333
We can't get maintenance done
on any of our weapons, either.

319
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,333
That must be inconvenient.

320
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,041
Yeah, but we manage
somehow! Hah!

Got it all ground up?

323
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,916
Uh-huh! Did a bunch! All this!

324

Oh, wow. I'm so proud of you!

325
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,250
That smell...
Pretty intense stuff.

326
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,041
It's like Nphi's potions.

327
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,791
It's bad, but not
that bad. Right?

328
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,125
[NEMU]
Mm-hm! Mm-hm!

329
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,791
What she's making is
something called "Enkaeshi."

330
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,916
It's a specialty of our village.

331
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,416
These herbs can only be
gathered this time of year.

332
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,916
They're potent medicine.

333
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,625
Sounds like this stuff must
be big business for you.

My apologies, Miss Nemu.

335
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,750
[NEMU] Hm! But look. I'm
almost out of the herbs!

336
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,416
I'll be done with these
by the end of the day.

337
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,958

already covered

that I know of.

Hey.

00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,208
You got a message for us?

343
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,083
[KYUMEI] Yeah. It seems
like something weird

344
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,708
is happening in Tob Forest.

345
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,208
What do you mean?

346
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,500
It can't be.

347
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,583
Are the people who attacked
the village back?

348
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,000
No.

349
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,416
It's like a disturbance coming
from deep in the forest.

350
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,666
That's bad timing,
because we need to gather

351
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,958
those herbs before
it's too late.

352
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,250
Sorry boss, but that's
way too dangerous.

353
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,083
[KYUMEI] I'd like to send
out a scouting party,

354
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,666
but it might take a while.

355
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,583
We've got our hands full just
watching over the village.

356
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,916
I need to go out there
in the next few days.

357
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,458
The herbs aren't in season long

358
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:52,250
and we'll be in a bad spot
if we can't sell more.

359
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,750
Let's bring this to Jugem
and see what he says.

Good. Thank you.

[JUGEM]
All right, here's the plan.

362
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,750
While Miss Enri and her group
are lookin' for herbs,

363
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,041
the rest of us will spread
out and scout the area,

364
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,333
moving deeper into the forest.

[JUGEM] Report back if
you see anything strange.

As for Miss Enri's bodyguards,

Huh? That's not enough?

I've prepared various
alchemical, uh, concoctions.

Sure. Sounds great.
Not worried at all!

386

[NPHIREA]
It's Bebeyamok moss.

387
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,041
If you mix a clump or two
of that in healing potions,

388
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,625
it increases their
effectiveness a bit.

389
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,625
I never had a clue, wow.

390
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,458
So is it worth a lot of money?

391
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,833
Uh, a little.

392
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,250
Although in this case,
the herb Enri

393
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,500
is looking for
is worth a lot more.

I can come back here
for some moss any time.

[KAIJALI] Wow, Nphi's really
something, huh, Enri?

of these plants apart.

to all goblins?

aren't cut out for botany?

Hell if I know, but I
never met a goblin

The humidity is
high enough, too.

the kind of place

that those herbs like to grow.

much faster than me.

If he knows what's
happening in the forest,

[roars]

476
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,166
The chain!

477
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,208
Get down!

478
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,291

[KAIJALI]
Take that!

[BARGHEST 2A growls]

483
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,791
[ALL sigh]

484
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,333
[AGU] You saved me.
What tribe are you from?

485
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,958
Let's save the
questions for later.

486
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,875
We have to do something about
those injuries of yours.

487
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,958
Any way you can help?

488
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,833
You're bleeding all over
the place, aren't you?

489
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,333
Don't poison me!

490
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,666
What a pity.

491
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,125
I was looking forward to
giving this to Lord Gown.

492
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,583
Whoa.

493
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:34,750
And done!

494
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,458
This wasn't ideal,
but at least I can tell

495
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,708
Lord Gown it works, right?

496
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,583
And here I thought you
jerks were gonna kill me!

497
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,833
Uh. I mean, thank you
for saving my life.

498
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,583
That's better! Show a
little gratitude, brat.

499
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:48,875
I'm not a brat!

500
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,291
My name's Agu and I am
the fourth son of Ah,

501
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,916
the leader of the Gigu Tribe!

502
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,833
[ENRI]
Nice to meet you, Agu.

503
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,125
So what happened?

504
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,416
Where'd you get all those cuts

505
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,375
and what are you
doing in the woods?

506
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:02,041
[AGU] I got attacked,
so I ran. That's all.

507
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,875
We need more details.

508
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,958
Wasn't just the barghest
that attacked you.

509
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:10,458
Uh! The Giant of the
East sent his minions.

510
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,333
The Giant of the East?

511
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,125
And the Demon Snake of the West.

512
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,416
He joined up with him.
War is coming.

513
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:52,833
[AINS] Carne Village would've
been wiped from the map

514
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:55,958
by the Slane Theocracy
had I not intervened.

515
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:58,083
It's population has decreased,

516
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:00,750
but with the help of the
summoned goblins I gave Enri,

517
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,541
it may yet recover.

518
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:06,166
After discovering unsettling
changes within the Great Forest,

519
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,041
Enri makes her way to E-Rantel
in order to run errands

520
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:12,375
and request the assistance
of the Adverturer's Guild.

521
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:16,083
Chapter 3: "Enri's Upheaval
and Hectic Days."

522
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,000
Your life was once saved.

523
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,958
How will you use it?
