00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:13,708
[ARCHE] The more I look at it,
the stranger it seems.

2
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,666
I can't tell what era
these ruins are from

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,666
or what culture built them.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,916
That's a good sign.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,458
It means we're that
much more likely

6
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,916
to run into something
interesting inside.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,416
Think that's guaranteed.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,000
Although there's also the chance

9
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,750
that a terrifying
undead lurks in there.

10
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:31,083
[ARCHE]
Still. I'm a bit excited.

11
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,166
[IMINA]
Same here.

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,750
I wanna know why
this tomb was built.

13
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,583
And what kinda person
got buried inside it.

14
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:37,583
Yeah.

15
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:38,791
There's nothin'
quite as exciting

16
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,083
as exploring a total unknown.

17
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:45,708
What would excite me is
if it were full of money.

--[ARCHE] What?

20
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:55,666
Well, I'm sure this'll
be our best job yet.

21
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,166
[HEKKERAN] Once the four
teams have signaled


22
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,375
that they're in position,
we'll all move in at once.


23
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:36,791
Each team will explore one
of the smaller mausoleums.

24
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:40,000
After that, we'll all meet up
at the larger one in the center.

25
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:40,791
[GRINGHAM]
Good.

26
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,250
[ERYA]
Simple enough.

27
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,916
[PARPATRA]
That works for me.

28
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,583
[THIEF 7A] That was one
short-lived invisibility spell.

00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,875
It lasted as long
as needed. Now come.

No traps as of yet.

Continual Light.

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,166
And Continual Light.

33
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:13,166
[GRINGHAM] Hm. I've not
seen such a crest before.

Have any of you?

[CASTER 7A]
No, don't think I have.

[PRIEST 7A] Doesn't look
like a Re-Estize sigil.

[WARRIOR 7A]
Oh, by the way, Gringham.

00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,541
You can start acting normal now.

39
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,750
There's nobody else around here.

40
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,750
True.

00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,541
Man, that crap's exhausting!

42
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,083
I feel so stupid, talking like
some kind of white knight.

43
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,250
[CASTER 7A]
The other groups bought it,

44

but you can relax
now that it's just us.

45
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,666
Nah, I'd better keep it up.

46
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,791
If I let myself slip
out of character now,

47
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,750
I'll have a hell of a time
getting back into it later.

48
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,791

when I'm on the job.

I'm more talented than I am

[GROUP laughs]

[GROUP]
Right!

00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,291
[THIEF 7A] This banner is
woven from precious metals.

55
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,708
Amazing.

56
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,416
I bet this would fetch a
pretty good price on its own.

57
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,916
[THIEF 7A]
Should we go ahead and take it?

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,375
[GRINGHAM] It's far too unwieldy
to carry through the ruin,

59
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,375
and besides, we haven't
fully explored this room yet.

Hey, Gringham. What kept you?

My apologies for
making you wait.

We didn't actually decide
on a rendezvous time,

so you're good.

Tell me.

68
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,666
Was there treasure in the
mausoleum your team explored?

69
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,083
It was chock full of it.

00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:38,416
We're excited. Parpatra
says his was, too.

71
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,750
I'm glad to hear that.

72
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,958
It seems this ruin has
riches enough for all.

73
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,583
[HEKKERAN] Doesn't look like
we'll have any trouble

74
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,333
accessing the
lower floors, but...

75
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,958
This place reeks of death.

76
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,541
Yeah, that's my worry.

77
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:54,458
It's a stench I remember from
my time on the Katze Plains.

78
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,875
I have a proposal
for the other teams.

79
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,166
[WORKERS]
Huh?

80
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,500
I and the rest of
Green Leaf will go back out

81
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,416
and look for any
secret entrances.

82
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,416
I think it's fairly
likely there are

83
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,166
other ways to get inside.

84
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,416
The elder makes a valid point.

85
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,958
If providence wills it,

86
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,875
he may find a safe
passage that leads

87
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,916
directly to the
center of the tomb.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,208
But I must say.

89
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,125
My team will be taking
a loss, so in exchange,

90
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,291
we'd like to have a share
of any treasure you find.

91
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:26,083
Let's see... About ten percent
from each team should do.

92
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,416
And if there's a route
to the lower levels,

93
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,083
how about my team takes
the first crack at it?

94
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,833
We have no qualms with that.

95
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,083
Neither do we.

97
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,083
Sharing ten percent of my
treasure isn't a problem. But--

Great! I'm glad everyone agrees.

Good luck down there!
And be careful.

leave them for us!

is ruled by some great monster.

00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,875
Greetings, my lord.
Welcome home.

160
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:34,041
[AINS]
It's good to be back.

161
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,041
The intruders should
be entering now,

162
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,791
just as we planned.

163
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,791
Are we fully prepared
to welcome them?

164
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,500
Everything is ready, sire.

165
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,500
I'm certain that
our guests will enjoy

166
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,375
what we have in store for them.

167
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,166
[AINS]
Very good.

168
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,833
I look forward to seeing
your hospitality at work.

169
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,875
You can watch from here.

170
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,708
[AINS]
Hm. And so it begins.

171
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,500
Don't even let one of
them leave unscathed.

172
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,208
[ALBEDO]
As you say, my lord.

173
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,250
For the crime of entering
the Supreme Being's abode,

174
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,250
these imbecilic thieves
must be punished

175
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,833
in the harshest of ways.

176
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,458
Also, before they're
all torn to bits.

177
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,333
Have you chosen which
group you'd like to use

178
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,583
as rodents for the
testing of the sword?

179
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,708
[AINS]
Ah, yes.

180
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,916
[HEKKERAN]
Whelp.

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,208
This job's goin' a lot
smoother than expected.

182
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,041
That first encounter
was almost too easy.

183
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,416
Shh.

184
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,750
[HEKKERAN]
That's a bother.

185
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,916
[ARCHE] Two of those
skeletons are mages.

186
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,416
They can use first tier magic.

187
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,000
If we don't take them out fast,
they could be a problem.

188
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,916
But skeletons are tough
to snipe with arrows.

189
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,916
Let me handle this.

190
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,333
Now. Turn Undead!

191
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,208
Nice work. You took 'em all out!

192
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,583
[THIEF 7B]
I feel like we're gonna lose out

193
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:13,958
on a lot of treasure.

194
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,541
We're getting priority
on tomorrow's foray,

195
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,583
so it won't be a
complete loss for us.

196
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,375
Besides, if you ask me,
it's dangerous

197
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,375
to be the first group to
explore an unknown dungeon.

198
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,083
Best to let someone
else take that risk.

199
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,250
That's a very
pragmatic approach.

200
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,416
[PARPATRA]
Hm?

201
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:39,000
Well then. So much for that.

202
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,750
What do you think
we should do now?

203
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,333
They don't outnumber us.

204
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,833
Maybe we can manage.

205
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,750
Gotta say, with the
shape this tomb's in,

206
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,916
these maids have
really been slacking.

[PRIEST 7B, WARRIOR 7B gasp]

209
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,625
[ENTOMA]
We should kill them.

210
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,000
They need to die.

211
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,125
It isn't enough
to simply kill them.

212
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:59,125
We should do it in the most
painful way imaginable.

[YURI]
Yes. Yes.

214
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,500
We planned to kill them
from the start, remember?

215
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,291
Though I am pleased to see
everyone so motivated.

I'm afraid circumstances
prevent us from being able

219
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,041
to butcher you with
our own hands.

220
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,625
Which is a shame.

Allow me to introduce the foe
you'll be facing in our stead.

Nazarick Old Guard,
arise. To war.

Say what?

224
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:30,083
A pincer attack?

225
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,791
No. It looks like they truly
plan to stay out of it.

Magic weapons.

229
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,250
Isn't this an honor.
To think you'd

230
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,333
summon so many mighty
undead just for us.

231
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,791
Tough break.

232
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,500
It would appear that
we've encountered

233
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,500
the most powerful
beings in the ruin.

234

Which means that, unfortunately,

my efforts to avoid danger
have put us in the thick of it.

So why don't we just run for it?

Look at those things.
They'll tear us apart.

We lost any chance of escape

as soon as they pincered
us. Push forward.
