1
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,375
[AURA] Our challengers
tonight are a band

2
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:16,708
of four foolish human
adventurers that dared

3
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:19,125
to infiltrate the
Great Tomb of Nazarick!

4
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,625
And against them,
we have the Supreme One.

5
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:25,583
He's the illustrious overlord
of the Great Tomb of Nazarick!

6
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:28,000
The King of Death itself,

7
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:31,666
Lord Ains Ooal Gown!

8
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,250
And his corner man--
or rather, lady--

9
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:38,458
is the overseer of the
floor guardians, Albedo!

10
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,000
This is my fault.


11
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,791
I wanted the money
and got too greedy.


12
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,000
What, are you kidding me?


13
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,833
If the rest of us
weren't just as greedy,

14
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:20,958
then we wouldn't be here.

15
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,041
That's right--we all
decided to take on

16
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,166
this job together.

17
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,625
Comes with the territory.

18
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,166
Sometimes a gig
goes south, right?

19
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,041
I'm not hopeful, but let's
try to talk this through.

20
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,750
Might be worth a shot.

21
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,958
I must offer you my most
sincere apologies.

22
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,250
Master Ains Ooal, uh...

23
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,458
[AINS]
Ains Ooal Gown.

24
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,291
[HEKKERAN] Yes, of course.
Master Ains Ooal Gown.

25
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,541
I am deeply sorry
for any displeasure

26
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,833
that our intrusion
has caused you.

27
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,708
If you might show us your mercy,

28
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,875
I would gladly pay
any price you ask.

29
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,458
We have plenty of gold to offer.

30
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,666
[AINS] I'm afraid that your
perspective is flawed.

31
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,833
After all, if you were to
find maggots in your food,

32
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,041
you wouldn't ask what
they had to offer--

33
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,416
you'd crush them
dead on the spot.

34
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,750
Although in that case,

35
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,791
the maggots themselves
are blameless.

36
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:17,541
You, on the other hand, knew
full well what you were doing.

37
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,958
You invaded my home to
satisfy your petty greed.

38
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,875
That makes you
lower than a maggot.

39
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,875
Please, just let me explain.
There's a reason why--

40
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,833
[AINS]
Silence!

41
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,875
Do not compound
your transgressions

42
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,916
with obvious lies.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,541
What if we were given
permission to be here?

44
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,083
[AINS]
That's impossible.

45
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:41,458
Who could have given you
permission, other than myself?

46
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,625
I assure you, it happened.

47
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,500
[AINS]
You're bluffing. Buying time.

48
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,500
Making a fool of me.

49
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:53,375
But, fine. I'll entertain
your little story.

50
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,500
Since you are so
confident, tell me.

51
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,958
Who gave you
permission to be here?

52
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,416
It could only be one person.

53
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,583
Surely you must know him.

54
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,000
[AINS]
"Person?"

55
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,750
Or rather, monster,
and a giant one at that.

56
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,500
I only spoke to him
for a moment,

57
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,125
so I'm afraid he didn't
give me his name.

58
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,166
[AINS]
A giant, you say?

59
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,625
Can you elaborate?
What did he look like?

60
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,666
His body was real shiny.

61
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,875
[AINS]
Shiny, huh?

62
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:32,875
[AINS] All right then.
And what did he say to you?

63
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,250
One thing first.

64
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,166
I want you to promise
we can leave here in peace.

65
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,291
[AINS] If what you claim
is true and you really were

66
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,958
granted entrance by
a comrade of mine,

67
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,125
then yes,

68
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,791
I shall allow you to
leave here unharmed.

69
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,291
[HEKKERAN]
Comrade.

70
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:52,166
[AINS] What did he say
to you? Every last word.

71
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,500
He said "if you go to the
Great Tomb of Nazarick,

72
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,541
give Ains my regards."

73
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,458
That was the last I saw of him.

74
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:06,166
[AINS] "Ains"? "Give <i>Ains</i>
my regards," he said?

75
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,166
Uh-huh.

76
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:13,666
[AINS laughs]

77
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,250
[GROUP gasps]

78
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,958
[AINS] I got my hopes up
for a moment, but if I stop

79
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:21,875
to think logically, your story
didn't hold up from the start.

80
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,041
[AINS growls]
Scum! All of you!

81
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,541
You lie to me, in my home,

82
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,958
the place that I built
with my comrades!

83
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:36,125
Dragging your filthy boots
across its sacred grounds!

84
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:39,250
And then you taunt me
with the false words

85
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,208
of a friend you never met!

86
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,083
An insult to my
memories of them!

87
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,375
I'll kill you!

88
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:51,750
[AINS yells]

89
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,916
[AINS]
Well, those are my feelings.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,500
But in truth, I can
scarcely blame you.

91
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,000
Your life hangs in
the balance, after all.

92
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,750
I'm sure you would say
anything to survive.

93
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:05,791
And frankly, if I were to
indulge in this wrath of mine,

94
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,250
it would be selfish.

95
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,791
Albedo! Aura!

96
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,541
As well as any other
Guardians who can hear me.

97
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,125
I order you to cover your ears!

98
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,416
[gasps]

99
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,458
[AINS sighs]

100
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,583
[AINS] Although I'm
standing here right now,

101
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:28,125
I was opposed to the plan of
luring thieves into Nazarick.

102
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:31,250
Still, I accepted it because
I value Demiurge's judgement

103
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,541
and he insisted that it was
the best course of action

104
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:37,166
for us moving forward.

105
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,875
Well, it's fine.
I'm done complaining.

106
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:44,500
It's time to dispose
of you vermin!

107
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,500
[SHALLTEAR squeals]

108
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,958
--[SHALLTEAR] Hey! Cocytus!
--[AINS] Listen up!

109
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,166
[AINS] You can stop
covering your ears now!

110
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,833
[HEKKERAN gasps]

111
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,666
[AINS]
Let's proceed, shall we?

112
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,041
If you won't attack,
then I will!

113
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,250
[AINS yells]

114
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,458
Martial Art! Twin Blade Strike!

115
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,208
Magic Arrow!

116
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:14,041
Lesser Dexterity!

117
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,958
[AINS]
Child's play.

118
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,625
He can nullify it?

119
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,250
He's too fast.

120
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,583
[AINS grunts]

121
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,083
Try this one!

122
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:28,375
[AINS]
Mm?

123
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,750
Now, Flash!

124
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,000
Here goes Lesser Strength!

125
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,916
[HEKKERAN] I won't miss again!
Twin Blade Strike!

126
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:44,250
[AINS] Melee combat has its
charm, but it's not very showy.

127
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,125
Also, for all my strength,

128
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,958
I find myself at a disadvantage

129
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:52,458
against a party with good
coordination like yours.

130
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:56,625
From now on, we're
going to play my game.

131
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:03,250
[AINS]
Come at me. If you dare!

132
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,791
He's a magic caster?

133
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,041
He can't be!

134
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,666
The guy's strong enough
with a sword, isn't he?

135
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,625
I hope that doesn't mean
he's even stronger with magic.

136
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,000
He's not. I just checked.

137
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,583
He must be trying
to trick us somehow.

138
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,208
[AINS] Hm. And where do you
get that impression?

139
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,875
I'm not sensing any
magic power from you at all.

140
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,458
[AINS]
Oh, you used detection magic.

141
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,375
My apologies. Try again.

142
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,541
[gasps, wretches]

143
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,500
[AINS]
I know I'm not exactly handsome,

144
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,458
but vomiting at the sight
of me is a bit rude.

145
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,708
[IMINA]
What did he just do?

146
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,458
Everyone, run away!

147
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,416
If we fight him, we'll all die!

148
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,583
I've never seen power
like this before!

149
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,666
It's impossible! Impossible!

150
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,958
[ARCHE sobs]
This is a nightmare!

151
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,833
We're not dead yet!
Quick, help her!

152
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,708
[ROBERDYCK]
Lion's Heart.

153
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,750
I mean it. He can
crush us like insects.

154
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,416
I felt it myself.

155
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,958
When he took off that
ring a moment ago,

156
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,083
my knees nearly
gave out beneath me.

157
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,750
[HEKKERAN] Yeah, but I
checked out the surroundings

158
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,416
and we can't run away.

159
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,083

If death is a mercy
then what manner of fate

303

awaits me here?

304

[AINS] Hm. I would like to
experiment on the nature

305

of your power as a
religious magic caster.

306

For example, if I altered
your memory to replace

307
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,166
the god you worship
with another,

308
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,916
would your power still function?

309

If so, then what is
the value of your faith?

310
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,791
And what is the purpose
of knowing that?

00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,666
[ARCHE grunts]

319
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,458
[ARCHE]
Is this a barrier?

320
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,541
[SHALLTEAR]
More like a wall.

321
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,166
[ARCHE grunts]

322
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,916
[SHALLTEAR] It seems you've yet
to understand your situation.

323
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,791
What you see before you
is the sixth floor

324
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,666
of the Great Tomb of Nazarick.

325
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,000
In other words, we're
underground right now.

326
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,750
[ARCHE]
Underground?

327
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:45,416
[SHALLTEAR] Mm-hm. Knowing
that, will you still run?

328
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,041
Is there any point?

329
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,333
A fair question, but no.

330
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,416
[sighs] I see.

331
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,083
[yells]

332
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,875
Can't blame you for trying,
but we're done here.

333
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,125
[SHALLTEAR]
Well, you're done at least.

334
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,291
I'm just getting
to the good part.

335
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,291
Though I am a bit
disappointed you didn't

336
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,625
break down into tears for me.

337
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,541
Don't worry, I'll be quick.

338
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,583
Why, you'll hardly feel
a thing when I kill you!

339
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:17,500
You have Lord Ains to thank
for such a generous mercy.

340
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,083
But first...

341
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,208
[ARCHE gasps]

342
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,666
A bit salty, huh?

343
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,916

[SHALLTEAR cackles]

346
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,291
[AINS]
Impressive work.

347
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,500
Not only did you
subdue the intruders,

348
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,250
you did so with precious
little expenditure.

349
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,666
I feel confident leaving you
in charge of our defense.

350
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,291
You're too kind, my lord.

351
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,458
[ENTOMA with ARCHE'S voice]
Excuse me, Lord Ains.

352
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:53,000
It is time for Lady Aura
and Lord Mare to depart.

353
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:56,208
[AINS]
Very well, I'll see them off.

354
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,500
Surely you can't be happy

355
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,375
to hear that thief's
voice again.

356
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,166
[AINS] On the contrary,
I'm quite pleased.

357
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,750
I was the one who
suggested she take

358
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,916
the girl's voice
in the first place.

359
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Which reminds me. Entoma?

360
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,500
[ENTOMA]
Lord?

361
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,333
[AINS] What did you do with
the rest of her body parts?

362
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,708
Did you ensure they
were put to good use?

363
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,416
[ARCHE] To the best of
my ability, Lord Ains.

364
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,250
To summarize, her head
was given to one

365
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:21,083
of the Silk Hat demons,
and her arms were divided

366
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,083
amongst the Deadman Struggle.

367
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,666
Lord Demiurge requested
her skin, and the rest

368
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,333
of her remains were fed
to Grant's children.

369
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,666
In the end, I believe
every last piece of her

370
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,916
was useful in some way.

371
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,458
[AINS]
Good. I'm pleased to hear it.

372
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,791
It is the responsibility
of the hunter to use

373
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,333
every part of its
prey without waste.

374
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,875
This is how we respect the dead.

375
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,916
I miss Arche.

376
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,416
When was she coming
home again, sis?

377
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,416
Should be real soon.

378
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,666
I can't wait!

379
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,750
[KUUDERIKA]
Me either!

380
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,041
[UREIRIKA] We're going
to live somewhere new

381
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,791
after she comes back, right?

382
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,041
[KUUDERIKA]
I hope so!

383
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,583
[UREIRIKA]
It's so late! Wish she'd hurry.

384
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,291
[KUUDERIKA]
I know, huh?

385
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,541
[UREIRIKA] I'm gonna have
her read me a story!

386
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,916
[KUUDERIKA] And I'm gonna
have her sleep in my bed!

387
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,791
No fair, that's cheating!

388
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,125
What? You're cheating, too!

389
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,333
[BOTH giggle]

390
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,916
It's fine.

391
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,583
'Cause if we all live together,
then we can just take turns!

392
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,666
[KUUDERIKA]
Mm-hm! Together with you.

393
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,125
And together with Arche.

394
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,208
[JIRCNIV]
None of the Workers survived?

395
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,791
[VASSALS gasp]

396
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,291
So soon, too.

397
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,458
--[VASSAL 08D] Then what's next?
--[VASSAL 08C] Don't know.

398
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,916
Very well then. Now
we know the strength

399
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,833
of this Ains Ooal Gown.

400
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:13,000
Those were high capable teams,
so he's not to be trifled with.

401
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,208
He's a true threat.

402
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,833
[FLUDER] You have grown
to be a fine leader.

403
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:20,125
I've served under six
generations of emperors,

404
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,375
and even amongst
this kingdom's finest,

405
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,500
your talents are extraordinary.

406
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,666
I have raised you
like my own son

407
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,208
and tried to instill
all of my wisdom,

408
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,541
and yet this time, I--

409
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,583
[JIRCNIV]
Old man?

410
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,916
You must excuse me,
Your Majesty.

411
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,583
I was lost in thought.
Pay me no heed.

412
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,458
No, on the contrary.

413
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,666
Even if you're getting
on in years a bit.

414
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,583
I still value your
every word. Truly.

415
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,000
Thank you for your kindness.

416
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:48,583
I shall endeavor to be
ever worthy of such favor.

417
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:52,333
As for the Workers, we need
to clean up the pieces.

418
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,208
Taking the head
of one foolish noble

419
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:57,458
should settle things nicely.
Was that the idea?

420
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,333
Just as you say, Your Majesty.

421
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,458
And the people in this
room are the only ones

422
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,250
who know the truth of it.

423
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,625
Although, to be safe,
I suppose we--

424

[rumbling]

425
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,333
What is this?
Are we under attack?

426
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,625
[EMPIRE KNIGHT 08A]
Your Majesty! A dragon!

427
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,041
A dragon has landed
in the inner gardern!

428
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,916
[EMPIRE KNIGHT 08B]
What the hell is going on here?

429
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,625
[VASSAL 08A] It's not from
the Council State, is it?

430
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:23,000
[VASSAL 08B] Why did the
Royal Air Guard let it through?

431
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,916
[VASSAL 08C] Lord Paradyne,
do you have any clue

432
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,458
what this is about?

433
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:31,541
Unfortunately, it's not
a dragon I'm familiar with.

434
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:35,041
But it seems to have dark
elves riding on its back.

435
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,125
[BAZIWOOD]
He's just walking up to them.

436
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,500
I dunno if that's smart.

437
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,541
[EMPIRE KNIGHT 08A]
Your Majesty, please take cover.

438
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,375
They landed on our roof.

439
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,375
Clearly, no place is safe.

440
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:48,375
[EMPIRE KNIGHT 08A]
Even so--

441
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:50,708
[AURA]
Everyone, can you hear me?

442
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:54,083
My name is Aura Bella
Fiora and this is Mare.

443
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,458
Lord Ains Ooal Gown sent us.

444
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:00,416
[AURA] The Great Tomb
of Nazarick, which Lord Ains

445
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,041
calls his home, was
recently invaded by some

446
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:05,708
unsavory sorts,
sent by your emperor!

447
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:07,625
This has put him in a bad mood!

448
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:10,208
If no one comes to apologize
for this offense,

449
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:12,083
he will reduce your
country to ash!

[gasps]

451
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:14,666
And as proof,

452
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,416
we'll start by eliminating
everyone here.

453
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,208

[VASSALS gasping, murmuring]

458
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,833
[AINS] Emperor Jirkniv
receives my message

459
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:55,458
and opts wisely to
respond by apologizing

460
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,875
for the Workers'
trespass in person.

461
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,583
Jirkniv is considered a genius

462
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,958
compared to the emperors
who preceeded him.

463
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,833
He wishes to see Nazarick
with his own eyes.

464
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:07,041
And, perhaps, to win me over.

465
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,416
Before, he sent trespassers,

466
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,666
but now, he comes as a guest.

467
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,125
I'll be sure to
welcome him accordingly.
