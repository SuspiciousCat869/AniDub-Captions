00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,833

of a barghest.

If it hits the troll's nose,
its sense of smell should be

00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:05,833
[laughs nervously]

326
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,333
[NPHIREA]
Uh...

327
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,250
So sweet.

328
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,750
Yeah...

329
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,291
That's probably because of
all the sugar cubes you used.

330
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,291
Sweets are pretty hard to
come by back at the village.

331
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,166
You know, I might find
a way to change that

332
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,666
if I'm able to learn
spice magic someday.

333
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,541
Try your best to learn it!

334
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,208
[NPHIREA]
Uh. Yeah. Sure.

335
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,875
Thank you so much for
bringing me here!

336
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:35,041
This place is the best.
It's so clean and shiny!

337
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,541
Lord Gown.

338
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,625
Please let me apologize if
my sister was rude in any way.

339
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,041
[AINS]
No. Please allow me to apologize

340
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,500
for taking so long.

341
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,666
[ENRI] Not at all!
Thanks for showing her.

342
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,125
[AINS]
Of course.

343
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,583
Now, before we discuss the
success of Nphirea's potion,

344
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,625
why don't the three of you eat?

345
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,916
What's on this evening's menu?

346
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,500
For this evening's dinner,

347
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,083
our appetizer shall
be piercing lobster,

348
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,583
drizzled with a
noatun fish velouté.

349
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,750
For your next appetizer,
we'll be serving

350
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,958
a pan-sizzled Visofnir
rooster foie gras.

351
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,708
Then we'll move on
to a cream soup

352
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,833
made with Alfheim
yam and chestnuts.

353
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,875
After that, we'll be
serving the main course

354
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,833
for the evening.
A marbled steak,

355
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,541
hewn from the Ancient Frost
Dragon of Jotunheim.

356
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,916
Then, for your dessert.

357
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,083
A compote of the
golden apples of Idunn,

358
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,375
drizzled with yogurt.

359
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,000
These will be
accompanied, of course,

360
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,750
by a golden tea ice cream.

361
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,875
In regards to your
after-meal drink,

362
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,166
coffee may not be
to everyone's liking,

363
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,208
so we've prepared pitchers
of iced Roulesh Peach Water.

364
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,458
And that's tonight's menu.

365
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,000
[ENRI]
Did she just cast a spell?

366
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,458
If there's to be
a child present,

367
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,750
I would steer clear--

368
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,750
[AINS]
We have a child present.

369
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,458
So perhaps we should
steer clear of foie gras.

370
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:52,166
I think something light and
refreshing might be better.

371
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,916
Ah, in that case, I can
have the chefs substitute

372
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,875
a scallop salad served with
a plum confit dressing.

373
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:01,208
[AINS] I see. That should
be better, don't you think?

374
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,291
Oh, yeah, we like
salad just fine,

375
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,250
thank you for asking.

376
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,833
[AINS]
Then let's begin.

377
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,333
Although I will not be
eating with you tonight.

378
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,875
I hope that won't
stop the three of you

379
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,500
from eating all you wish.

380
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:16,541
Please enjoy this
meal as a family.

381
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:20,166
[muttering] I'll have to add one
more name to Lupisregina's list.

382
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,000
Huh? What did you say?
I couldn't hear you.

383
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,916
[AINS] Oh. It's nothing
important, Nemu.

384
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,458
Please, follow me.

385
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:28,500
Right!

386
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,500
Uh--

387
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:42,000
I just realized
I can't beat him.

388
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:45,708
Well, not that I ever had
a chance of competing.

389
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:49,458
Lord Gown's on a
completely different level.

390
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,083
He's not the kind of
guy I'd fall for.

391
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,625
But you are, Nphi.

392
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,958
[gasps]

393
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,500
[NPHIREA]
Let's go.

394
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,333
[ENRI]
Sure.

395
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:53,083
[AINS] Our visit to the capital
of the Baharuth Empire

396
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,416
revealed it to be
a vibrant city.

397
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,416
It seems the young
emperor, Jircniv,

398
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,666
is quick to toss aside
the incompetent.

399
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,625
He has also been known
to hire commoners

400
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,666
if they possess
sufficient skill.

401
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,166
After completing a small errand,
I visit the Adventurer's Guild

402
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,541
in the guise of
Momon of Darkness.

403
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:13,416
Presented with an easy job,
I make the decision to take it.

404
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,583
Chapter 6:
"Invitation to Death."

405
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:19,958
You are all fools for
undertaking this mission.
