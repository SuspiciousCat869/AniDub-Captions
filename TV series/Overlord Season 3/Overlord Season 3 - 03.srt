[AGU]
What is this place?

2
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:16,000
[ENRI]
Our village.

3
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,833
Why, is something the matter?

4
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:21,416
Kinda looks like
the Monument of Ruin.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,291
Sounds like a scary place.

6
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:24,375
Sure is!

7
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,125
If you ask me,
it's the scariest part

8
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:27,791
of the whole Great Forest.

9
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,333
It's a big building made of wood

10
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:32,083
that's completely surrounded
by undead warriors.

11
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,166
Yeah, and whereabouts is it?

12
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,458
[ENRI] Let's talk more once
we're inside the village, Gokou.

13
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:38,833
Smart idea!

14
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:39,666
Huh?

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,916
[yelps] Hey!

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,416
[LUPISREGINA]
Good old Enny.

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,958
You still make the cutest little
scream when you're scared.

18
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,875
Oh, Miss Lupis!

19
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,500
[LUPISREGINA]
So, spill.


20
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:24,375
How'd this goblin kid
end up with you?


21
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,166
Well... I was just...

22
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,125
No! Wait, don't tell me!

23
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:32,666
Ooh! You stole Nphy's girl
from right under his nose?

24
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,333
Well, isn't this a tragedy--

25
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,500
the hopes and dreams of
such a pure-hearted boy

26
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,000
crushed into the dirt!

27
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,666
This is so hilarious!

28
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,333
[laughing]

29
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,083
Just kidding.

30
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,250
So...

31
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,666
Why'd you bring this
thing back with you?

32
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,291
Calm down, I'm not
gonna eat you.

33
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,833
I found her.

34
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:54,791
What's up?

35
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,291
Oh. Miss Britta.

36
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,791
We let a hobgoblin
inside our walls?

37
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,166
[gasps]

38
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,250
Hey, my bad.

39
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,833
The thing is, I used
to be an adventurer.

40
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,291
Kinda hard to get
outta that mindset.

41
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,833
An adventurer?

42
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,291
[BRITTA]
That's behind me now.

43
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,083
These days I'm
an apprentice ranger

44
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,875
that lives here in the village.

45
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,500
You'll be okay, Agu.

46
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,708
Carne Village is a place
where goblins and humans

47
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,208
live side by side.

48
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,541
That's what it looks like,
but I still can't believe it.

49
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,083
Okay, all of us are here,

50
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:28,083
so let's see what the
little guy has to say.

51
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,541
Well, Agu? Tell us about
this Giant of the East.

52
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,583
Sure. Originally,
the forest was controlled

53
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,458
by the Great Beast of
the South and two others.

54
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,291
The Giant of the East,

55
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,916
and also the Demon
Snake of the West.

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,666
The Great Beast of
the South might be

57
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,916
what we called the
Wise King of the Forest.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,458
But then the Great Beast
disappeared without a trace.

59
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,916
Which left the forest
out of balance.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,041
And not too long after that,
something else took its place.

61
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,916
That's the Monument of Ruin?

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,125
It is.

63
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,583
The master of that place
controls the undead.

64
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:04,083
We call him the Small Shadow
which Burrows in the Darkness.

65
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,541
And what does
all that have to do

66
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,333
with you getting attacked?

67
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,291
The Giant of the East
and the Demon Snake

68
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,708
of the West are gathering
their forces for an attack

69
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,333
on the King of Ruin.

70
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,333
They seemed to wanna
use all of us goblins

71
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,875
as foot-soldiers.
Or as emergency rations.

72
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,666
So most of us decided
we'd just hide from them.

73
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,166
But then...

74
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,125
They must be tough to send
your whole tribe into hiding.

75
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,333
If a monster that
powerful shows up,

76
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,083
there's no point in
trying to fight it.

77
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,958
We may as well just run
with the non-combatants.

78
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,708
[LUPISREGINA]
If you're in a bind,

79
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,500
I could always ask
Lord Ains to help you out.

80
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,041
This is our village.

81
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,250
So let's protect it ourselves.

82
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:46,750
We won't always be able
to rely on his charity.

83
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,708
Well, then, maybe we
should start by reporting

84
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,208
this to the village chief.

85
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,916
I'll pay a visit to the
Adventurer's Guild in E-Rantel

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,500
tomorrow and post our
situation as a job.

87
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,333
Hey. Could I come with you?

88
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,000
I've got some herbs to sell.

89
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,875
Oh. Sure.

90
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,500
I'll go get the other
militia members up to speed.

91
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah, I'm out, too.

around the village

00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,750
a bit more before I head home.

94
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,041
[NPHIREA]
Oh, Miss Beta.

95
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,875
Could I take a bit of your time?

96
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,500
If it's not a bother,
I was hoping

97
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,666
you could take
this to Lord Gown.

98
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,791
We haven't replicated
a fully red potion yet.

99
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:23,083
But I think this is a step
in the right direction.

100
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,666
I'm delighted to hear that.

101
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,791
I'm sure Lord Ains
will be equally pleased.

102

[LUPISREGINA] Wow! I was
right to come visit today.

Also, feel free to
call me Lupisregina.

104
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,083
I'll allow it just for you.

105
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,916
So, have women always
been the leaders

106

Huh?

108
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,166
Why does Miss Enri
have so much power?

109
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,166
It's 'cause she can kick
our butts in a fight.

[gasps]

111
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,416
I've seen Miss Enri
beat down a barghest

112
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,541
and break its neck
with just one hand!

113
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:59,000
After that, she drained its
blood into a cup and drank it!

Seriously?

115

scare the kid, Gokou?

is dangerous.

Best thing you can do
is avoid her attention.

for your own good, okay?

this is one crazy tribe.

That's fine. Did
something happen?

130

Well, we searched
through the forest,

131
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,958
and we managed to find a few
members of Agu's tribe.

I'm relieved to hear it.
You did great.

133
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,875
But there's more.

134
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,750
See, we captured the five ogres
who were chasing them.

That's right. And, well...

to accept them as their master.

163
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,500
I'm still just an
ordinary village girl.

164
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,208
I only did that because
Jugem asked me to.

165
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,583
Honestly, I spent
the entire time scared

166
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,708
that they would eat me.

167
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,125
I understand, but
even though they say

168
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,708
all ogres are man-eaters.

169
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,791
I think that just means
they're carnivores.

170
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,000
Since the goblins hunt,

171
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,250
I'm sure we'll have
plenty of meat for them.

172
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,166
So there shouldn't be much risk
of them attacking anyone.

173
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,666
Besides, at the moment,

174
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,916
we need all the help
that we can get.

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,666
Maybe we should've had them
pledge themselves to you.

176
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,500
I think I'm best
suited to supporting

177
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,250
the frontline fighters,
but you can hang back

178
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,666
and base your orders on
what you see happening.

179
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,291
Yeah, I guess. That makes sense.

180
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,791
And, by the way, about
us going to E-Rantel.

181
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:50,916
Oh, yeah!

182
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,375
I'm nervous about
going to the city,

183
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,708
but I'll try not
to embarrass you.

184
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,208
--Sorry.
--[ENRI] Why?

185
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,083
I have to heal the goblins
we rescued from Agu's tribe.

186
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,916
So I won't be able to join you.

187
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,916
I really wish I could though.

188
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,458
[ENRI]
Wait. I have to go by myself?

189
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,791
The goblins will escort you

190
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,041
all the way to
the gate, of course.

191
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,333
[ENRI] But, they're not allowed
to enter the city, are they?

192
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,750
I'll tell you what.

193
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,458
I bet I'm the only person
in the world in this bind.

194
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,875
It's so weird, suddenly
having to act like

195
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,375
I'm above other people.

196
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,791
And on top of that,
I have to go visit places

197
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:26,291
I've never been and do things
I've never done before!

198
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,208
So. Listen.

199
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,750
I was really just hoping to
sell some medicinal herbs.

200
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,000
First, I'll use Detect Magic.

201
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,708
[MAGIC CASTER grunts]
You'll not make a fool of me!

202
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:52,250
Reveal the magic item you
tried to sneak into the city!

203
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,083
Do you mean this thing?

204
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,500
--[SOLDIERS, MAGIC CASTER gasp]
--[ENRI] What?

205
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,583
[MAGIC CASTER]
Appraisal Magic Item.

206
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,375
What demonic relic is this?

207
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,208
It has such an
incredible power level

208
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,166
that my appraisal spell
couldn't measure it!

209
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,833
Madness! Impossible!

210
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,958
Tell us your true
identity, woman!

211
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,458
I thought you seemed
suspicious from the start!

212
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,625
Huh?

213
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,000
--Yeah, so did I!
--[ENRI] Wait, what?

214
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,375
Cease this frail
attempt at deception!

215
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,791
Tell us how you obtained
that artifact, wench!

216
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,500
Well, you see...

217
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,041
It was a present I got
from Lord Ains Ooal Gown,

218
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,458
a spellcaster who
saved my village.

219
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,666
You mean you received

220
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,000
such a terrifyingly
valuable item for free?

221
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:34,208
What? Are you saying that this
item would be expensive?

222
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,958
[MAGIC CASTER]
Don't play stupid!

223
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,916
That horn can summon
a horde of foul goblins.

224
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,333
Though I don't actually know
the exact number, persay.

225
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,791
--[SOLDIER 03C] Goblins?
--[MAGIC CASTER] Yes.

226
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,625
It is in equal parts
dangerous and valuable.

227
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,500
It could be sold for
at least 3,000 gold.

228
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:49,291
No way.

229
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,458
That much?

230
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:51,791
I could understand if she were

231
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,833
an experienced magic
user, or even just

232
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:57,041
a highly ranked adventurer,
but this simply makes no sense!

233
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,541
If her claim that
she's nothing more

234
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,208
than a village girl were true,

235
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,791
then she wouldn't
have that item!

236
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,833
She must be planning
something nefarious!

237
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,875
No, I-- I'm telling the truth.
I'm just a village girl.

238
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,708
Move, men, arrest her at once!

239
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:09,833
You're kidding me!

240
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:10,958
Don't try to resist!

241
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,333
[SOLDIER 03A]
No sudden moves!

242

I'm sorry, but you've
made a mistake.

243
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,458
I'm just a girl from
a country village!

244
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:20,208
I don't know anything
about magic, I swear!

245
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,791
[MOMON]
What's this about?

246
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:22,958
Huh?

247
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,625
Well, if it isn't Lord Momon.

248
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,000
It's an honor, sir.

249
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,541
[MOMON]
What has she done?

250
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:33,958
Well, sir, she was in possession
of a suspicious item.

251
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:38,166
[MOMON] Enri. Yes.
It's Enri Emmott, correct?

252
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,208
Uh. Yeah. Have we met, sir?

253
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,541
[MOMON]
Uh--

254
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,750
Oh!

00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,000
You're the gentleman
who came to my village

256
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,875
with Nphi, aren't you?

257
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,541
But, how do you know my name?

258
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,666
[MOMON]
Mm... Hm...

259
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,333
Do you want to talk?

[MAGIC CASTER clears throat]
Release the girl at once.

But, why would we do that?

262
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,375
I have just been assured
that her intentions

263
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,875
are good by the Adamantite
class adventurer Lord Momon.

264
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,625
I understand, sir.

00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,791
We grant you entry
into E-Rantel.

Oh. Thank you.

You guys have a nice day.

269
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,958
[ENRI]
This is worth 3,000 gold?

270
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,791
It's hard to believe
that Lord Gown would

271
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,458
give these things away
if they're that valuable.

272
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,916
And I've already
used up one of them.

Greetings. Mr. Momon
bade me to ask you

275
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,916
a quick question.

276
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,416
Beautiful.

277
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Such flattery will get you--

278
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,416
[ENRI]
Just like Miss Lupisregina.

279
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,541
[gasps]

280
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,125
Oh! That was random.

281
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:55,375
But, I guess you just remind me
of another pretty person I know.

282
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,291
Your personalities
are different, but--

283
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,125
You have my thanks.

00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,916
Huh?

285
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,458
Anyway, on behalf
of Lor--uh, Mr. Momon,

286
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,041
I ask this question;
please answer with haste.

287
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,458
Miss Emmott.

288
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,125
What business do you
have in E-Rantel?

289
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,416
Well, before I get to that.

290
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,791
Mr. Momon's the whole reason
I was able to get in.

291
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,541
So please let him know
that I'm very grateful.

292
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,416
[NABE]
Consider it done. Proceed.

293
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,708
Thank you.

294
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,916
So there were a few things
I needed to do here.

295
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,666
Let's see. First,
I'm gonna visit the temple.

296
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,625
I plan to see if any
of the homeless there

297
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,416
would like to move
to our village.

298
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,541
Then I need to post a job
at the Adventurer's Guild,

299
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:37,500
sell these medicinal herbs,
and purchase supplies.

300
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,666
I understand. Farewell.

301
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,250
What an interesting lady.

302
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,833
[ENRI] My village needs
defenders against

303
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,833
the Giant of the East and
Demon Snake of the West.

304
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,416
Both of those creatures
are incredibly powerful.

305
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,083
I'm afraid that only
Adamantite class adventurers

306
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,708
can accept your request.

307
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,208
Is one around?

308
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,000
Their services come
at a very high price.

309
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,125
Right, uh.

310
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,125
Doesn't the capital
give financial aid

311
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,458
for this kind of thing?

312
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,708
They do.

313
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,916
However, that subsidy
is only able to cover

314
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,958
a portion of the
total cost accrued.

315
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,833
Thank you for explaining.

316
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,333
Could I get an estimate
of what the cost might be?

317
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:20,250
[RECEPTIONIST 03A sighs] Give
me a moment to calculate it.

318
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,250
For now, you can take a seat.

319
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,750
[ENRI]
Thanks again.

320
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:29,125
[sighs] She seemed
really annoyed with me.

321
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,958
I suppose that makes sense.

322
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,541
A customer who can't pay
isn't a customer at all.

323
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,875
[ENRI]
I could always make some money

324
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:43,083
by selling this horn,
but I got it as a gift.

325
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:46,583
It would be ungrateful of me
to pawn it off like that.

326
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,791
[sighs]

327
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,250
[RECEPTIONIST 03A]
Miss Emmott? Miss Emmott!

328
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,875
Miss Enri Emmott
of Carne Village,

329
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,833
or no, Lady Emmott!

330
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,791
Um. Yes, ma'am?

331
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,583
[RECEPTIONIST 03A]
About your village's request.

332
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,708
May I ask for some
additional information please?

333
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,750
Yeah, no problem.

334
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,541
If you find the idea agreeable,

335
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,375
we could discuss the
details over a drink

336
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,083
in the reception room.

337
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,750
I'm begging you!
Tell me every last detail!

338
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,041
I shudder at the
thought of missing

339
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,750
any shred of information!

340
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,625
Okay?

341
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,875
That was exhausting.

342
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,208
[KAIJALI]
Miss Enri!

343
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,791
[laughs]

344
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,208
[ENRI] The guild lady
had so many questions.

345
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,416
Which is weird, because I felt
like she blew me off at first.

346
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,125
[KAIJALI] Sounds like
you had a rough time.

347
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,916
On the plus side,
the medicinal herbs

348
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,375
sold for a great price.

349
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,250
It warms my heart to hear that.

350
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,291
Let us join in prayer
and thank our god

351
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,208
for blessing you on this day.

352
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,250
Then let's join
as husband and wife.

353
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,000
We heard that last part, Cona!

354
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,958
You know, I still
feel like I should've

355
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,125
accompanied Miss Enri
into the city.

356
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,333
Don't be stupid!

357
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,250
If one of us goblins
tried to enter the city,

358
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,500
he'd be killed by the
guards immediately!

359
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,833
Heh! I'd like to see them try.

360
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,208
Don't worry, Miss Enri.

361
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,833
I, the mighty Gokou,
will always protect you.

362
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,125
And so will the rest of us!

363
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,833
Oh. That's right.

364
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,625
I was planning to wait
until we got back home,

365
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:31,125
but actually, I think this
might be the perfect time.

366
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,208
Kaijali.

367
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,416
It's for me?

368
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,125
[ENRI]
Gokou.

369
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,625
Unlai.

370
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:38,958
Nosuli.

371
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,166
Suigyo.

372
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,875
Cona.

373
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,291
I don't know much about weapons,

374
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,250
so I got someone from
the Adventurer's Guild

375
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,833
to help me pick them.

376
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,208
Finest sword I've had.

377
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,083
Got a nice heft to it.

378
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,666
This can do some damage.

379
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,125
This is a big help.

380
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,916
My last sword had just chipped.

381
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,333
Glad to help.

382
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,708
Wow. Miss Enri.

383
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,708
You picked these
out just for us?

384
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,708
I hope they're to your liking.

385
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,208
These are great gifts,

386
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,625
but I don't really feel
like we deserve them.

387
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,333
[ENRI] Not only did you risk
your lives to keep me safe,

388
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,416
you helped me rebuild
my home village.

389
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,500
I could never do enough
to fully repay you for that.

390
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:23,875
I know this isn't much, but,
I hope you'll accept it.

391
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:27,125
I'll always be grateful
for every last one of you.

392
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,958
You're so kind.

393
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,708
[ENRI]
What?!

394
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,958
Well, I hope you'll
at least consider it.

395
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,250
I will.

396
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,208
[KAIJALI]
What happened?

397
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,666
I'm sorry, but I
need a little time

398
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,375
to think things over
right now, Kaijali.

399
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,125
Hey-yoh!

400
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:16,166
Miss Lupisregina! Hi!

401
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,625
I'm so glad you're
here right now!

402
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,500
Whoa there, take it easy!

403
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,708
Someone help!

404
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,750
Save me! I'm being assaulted!

405
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:23,916
Oh, no...

406
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,583
[ENRI] What? No--
Calm down, I was just--

407
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,083
Aw, I didn't mean to upset'cha.

408
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,250
I was just makin'
a cute little joke.

409
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:34,458
It's fine. Could I
ask for some advice?

410
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,541
I'm kind of at
my wit's end here.

411
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,458
Is something stressing you out?

412
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:42,083
Well, your big sis Lupisregina's
got your back, okay?

413
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,791
C'mon, ask the question.

414
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,125
[laughs]

415
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,041
Long story short,
the village chief

416
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,291
wants me to take over for him.

417
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:55,166
A year ago, I was doing
chores for my parents.

418
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,916
I'd be an awful chief.

419
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,541
I'd run the village
straight into the ground.

420
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,791
The worst part is the whole
village got together without me.

421
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,791
And every last one of them
agreed that I should do it.

422
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,750
It's so ridiculous. So, uh...

423
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,416
I should just turn
them down, shouldn't I?

424
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,083
That's a toughie. I don't know.

425
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,583
I never promised I'd have
an answer for you, Enri,

426
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,416
just that I'd hear the question.

427
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,291
[chuckles] I really
can't help you out.

428
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,333
I can only say this much.

429
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,291
Whoever the village
chief may be,

430
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,666
they're going to make mistakes.

431
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,958
There have only
ever been 41 people

432
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,875
who could make the
perfect choice every time,

433
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,416
and none of us can hold
a candle to them.

434
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,791
There's no need to worry about

435
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,791
whether you'll make mistakes
because you're bound to.

436
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,333
That said,

437
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,250
out of all the denizens of this
village, logically speaking,

438
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,500
you're obviously the
most qualified candidate

439
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,166
for such a position.

440
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,041
Wait. Do you
really think that?

441
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,375
[LUPISREGINA]
I do.

442
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,416
Why don't'cha ask that
young man what he thinks?

443
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,500
[chuckles]

444
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,625
[ENRI]
What's that?

445
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,458
[NPHIREA]
It's the ogre's new home.

446
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,958
The goblins got together
and built it for them.

447
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,208
In just one day?

448
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,875
Yeah, Lord Gown
came by and lent us

449
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,708
a few stone golems to help out.

450
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:19,708
That's one more way
this village owes him.

451
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,708
So about you becoming chief.

452
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,708
I think... I really
think you should do it.

453
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,458
And why is that? I'm just a--

454
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,916
[NPHIREA] No. You're more
than "just a village girl."

455
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,583
You lead all the goblins.

456
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,250
And you're good at it, too.

457
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,041
Yeah, but--

458
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,000
[NPHIREA] When I talked to
Mr. Jugem and the others

459
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,041
about protecting the village,

460
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,416
they told me that,
push come to shove,

461
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,250
they would kidnap
you and escape.

462
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,583
What?

463
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,458
He also wanted me to help
them find and protect

464
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,875
Nemu so that we could
all run away together.

465
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,125
Oh.

466
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,666
But look, if you were
to become village chief,

467
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,500
that would make
this <i>your</i> village.

468
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,375
Knowing that, the goblins
would fight for it.

469
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,333
It might not seem like
much of a difference,

470
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:03,125
but to them, it really would be.

471
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,250
That magic horn really
makes the goblins

472
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,750
value their summoner.

473
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:10,375
If you ask me, that's 'cause
of who their summoner is.

474
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,666
Huh?

475
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,333
After all, you value
each and every one of them

476
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,375
as a unique individual.

477
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,000
Of course they treasure you.

478
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:21,291
Instead of using them as slaves,
you treat them as partners.

479
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,791
It's just that simple.

480
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,750
But, it's not like I'm the
only person in the village

481
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,416
who treats them nicely.

482
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,291
The others aren't rude,
but have you ever

483
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,208
heard them call
a goblin by his name?

484
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,416
I know I haven't.

485
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,750
[gasps]

486
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,041
Me neither.

487
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,541
That's how it is.

488
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,333
If my opinion matters to you,

489
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,916
I think you would be good
at this kind of thing.

490
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,666
And if you become chief,

491
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,666
you'll unite humans and
goblins under one leader.

492
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,625
Well, I suppose everybody
would help me, right?

493
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,916
[NPHIREA]
Of course.

494
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,791
All right then.
Thanks for the advice.

495
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,583
I'm on my way to talk
to the village chief.

496
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:07,833
Once a choice has been made,
there's no point delaying.

497
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,791
'Kay. I'm rooting for you, Enri.

498
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,583
[LUPISREGINA]
Just as I thought.

499
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,708
She really is doing it.

500
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:02,666
This is so exciting.

501
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,208
[giggles]

502
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:08,208
[YURI] Lupis? Lord Ains
has called for you.

503
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,833
Oh, well, if it isn't
my big sis Yuri.

504
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:13,958
And what is it that has you
in such a pleasant mood?

505
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,208
Just now,

506
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:18,333
a new leader has been
born in this village.

507
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:20,000
One with great potential.

508
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:22,458
Why, she could change history.

509
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:25,333
Unless, something wicked
was to come along

510
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:28,500
and snuff out her spark just
as it was about to kindle.

511
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,083
I wonder what
kind of expressions

512
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:32,375
those villagers would make.

513
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,958
Just the thought of
them screaming out

514
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,958
as they're crushed
underfoot like insects

515
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,958
makes me tremble
with excitement.

516
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:44,166
[YURI] My, my. You are
a sadistic creature.

517
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,875
Yeah, I guess I am.

518
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:49,625
I just really hope
this village burns.

519
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,458
[AINS] After we built
our Nazarick decoy

520
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:55,000
in the Great Forest,
the Giant of the East

521
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,250
and Demon Snake of
the West united

522
00:23:57,333 --> 00:24:00,083
and began gathering
forces to oppose us.

523
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:03,083
The names of these new monsters
have piqued my interest,

524
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,083
so I will journey forth
into the forest

525
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:07,708
to seek their layer
with Aura at my side.

526
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:11,833
Meanwhile, I have also devised
a test for Lupisregina.

527
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:16,500
Chapter 4: "Giant of the East,
Demon Snake of the West."

528
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:20,000
If you value your life,
submit yourself to me.
