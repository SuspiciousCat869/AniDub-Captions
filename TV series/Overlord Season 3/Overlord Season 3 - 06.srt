Summon Undead Sixth.

[FLUDER]
Submit to me.

00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:51,041
[FLUDER] Still, the
monster will not yield.

7
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:54,916
If I could control this fiend.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,666
I would surpass even
Rigrit Bers Caurau,

9
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,750
and become the most accomplished
magic caster in this world.

10
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,041
I believe you've surpassed

11
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,583
the power of the
Thirteen Heroes, sir.

12
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,916
Anything to report?

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,291
Nothing as of yet, sir. Sorry.

14
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:27,791
That's a shame.

15
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:31,791
We are still unable to simulate
a natural transformation.

16
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,041
Correct.

17
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,250
We're currently testing
to see whether proximity

18
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,750
to the undead is enough to
turn a corpse into a zombie.

[EMPIRE KNIGHT 06A]
My Lord Fluder. I have news.

21
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,208
A pair of Adamantite
class adventurers

22
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,125
wish to meet with you.

23
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,250
[FLUDER] Are they from
Silver Thread Bird?

24
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,958
Or if not, perhaps they're
members of Eight Ripples.

25
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,291
[EMPIRE KNIGHT 06A]
No, sir.

26
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,541
They're a team that calls
themselves "Darkness."

27
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:16,958
[FLUDER]
Hm.

28
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,625
[AINS] These are happy
times for the Empire.

29
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,250
[NARBERAL]
Oh? And why do you say that?

30
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,291
[AINS] The eyes of those
walking past are bright.

31
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,958
They're the eyes of
a people that believe

32
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,041
the future holds
promise for them.

33
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,500
I've quite enjoyed
the view so far.

34
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,708
[AINS]
Emperor El Nix rules here.

35
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,458
Though, by all accounts,
he earned his title

36
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,750
as the Bloody Emperor,
his reforms have

37
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,625
greatly improved
the people's lives.

38
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,125
According to Fluder,
he removed all incapable

39
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,833
nobles from power
and chose their replacements

40
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,791
based on merit alone.

41
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,833
The country is avidly
researching magic

42
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,041
and improving their military.

43
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,541
[AINS]
Take a look at those knights.

44
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,958
[HORSE whinnies]

45
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,083
[AINS] These professional
soldiers are the backbone

46
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,250
of the Empire's military.

47
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,625
[EMPIRE KNIGHT 06B]
Hey, look.

48
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,791
[EMPIRE KNIGHT 06C]
Adamantite adventurers?

49
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,375
[NARBERAL] I must say,
they still seem rather weak.

50
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,875
[AINS]
Indeed they are, to our eyes.

51
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,125
But they're far stronger
than any force comprised

52
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,333
of peasant levies and
self-equipped nobility.

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,083
[AINS]
Now, then.

54
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,083
We came all this way,
so we may as well

55
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:05,166
visit the local
Adventurer's Guild.

56
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,083
I'd like to do a simple
job to get my name out.

57
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,875
Though I hear the guild
is less active here.

58
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,166
I heard the same.

59
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,916
The second-rate sell-swords
common around here

60
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,750
are known as "Workers."

61
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,875
[AINS] They're not
necessarily inferior.

62
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,250
They just take quests
outside of the guild.

63
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,916
They aren't protected
by the guild,

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,875
but nor are they bound
by its rules.

65
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:29,041
I imagine there's some merit
in making such a choice.

66
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:33,416
[MOMONGA sighs]
Man, this is gonna be a hassle.

67
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,041
[DEMIURGE] This plan will
allow us to declare

68
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:38,208
the Great Tomb of Nazarick
a sovereign nation.

69
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,458
And to spread word of
the great and mighty

70
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,791
Ains Ooal Gown
throughout this world.

71
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,125
[AINS]
Yes.

72
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,166
I believe this will help
achieve our noble purpose.

73
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,125
You honor me.

74
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:54,000
My lord, with your blessing,
I'd like to begin at once.

75
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,958
[AINS]
Mm.

76
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,250
[MOMONGA]
Demiurge really did come up

77
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,125
with a kickass plan.

78
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:02,333
I'd be hard-pressed to come
up with something better.

79
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,541
And, regardless...

80
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,250
[AINS]
The die has already been cast.

81
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,625
[LOUNE] The "incident"
in the Re-Estize Kingdom

82
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,083
caused significant damage
and casualties there.

83
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,375
Our reports indicate
the demon Jaldabaoth

84
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,541
was eventually defeated
by an Adamantite class

85
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,166
adventurer known as
Momon of Darkness.

86
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,333
I see. And Momon
slayed this demon?

87
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,000
[LOUNE]
No, it escaped him.

88
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,416
The kingdom has
tightened security

89
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,375
and is searching for it.

90
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,000
But, despite their efforts,

91
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:35,833
there've been no sightings of
the demon in the days since.

92
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,750
Then the Re-Estize
Kingdom is already

93
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,666
in a state of exhaustion.

94
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,958
If so, then there may be
no need for us to wage

95
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,666
our annual war this year.

96
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,791
Through their
incompetent nobles,

97
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,041
we've learned key information.

98
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,583
The great Baharuth Empire
will never follow

99
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,375
in the footsteps of
that kingdom of fools.

100
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,375
I, Emperor Jircniv Rune
Farlord El Nix,

101
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,000
have an order for you.

102
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:05,083
Imperial Court Wizard
Fluder Paradyne.

103
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,958
Are you prepared to serve me?

104
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,083
[FLUDER]
Yes.

105
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:13,375
Begin to investigate the demon
Jaldabaoth will all haste.

106
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,875
Yes, Your Majesty.

107
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:19,500
This Momon of Darkness
piques my interest as well.

108
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,916
So, too, does Ains Ooal Gown,
the man who saved

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,625
the king's Chief Warrior.

110
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,833
Some powerful figures
are emerging.

111
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,166
Heroes and demons alike.

112
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,583
Makes me wonder.

113
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,916
It's been 200 years
since the war against

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,583
the Demon Gods was fought.

115
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,791
Perhaps we're overdue
for another war like it.

116
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,041
How do you suppose the
Four Imperial Knights

117
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,291
would perform in such a battle?

118
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,041
I dunno. Could get a bit dicey.

119
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,875
But with all four
of us together,

120
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,416
I bet we could make a
good account of ourselves.

121
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,875
If there's a chance
of victory, I'll fight.

122
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,166
But if defeat is
guaranteed, I'll retreat.

123
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,750
The emperor is here.

124
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,333
Do try to show
a bit more respect.

125
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,791
Worry not. You can
be as you are here.

126
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,208
Listen, old man.

127
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,041
Continue your
investigations both

128
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,083
on Momon of Darkness
and Ains Ooal Gown.

129
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,041
In regards to one, at least,

130
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:14,458
I have some news that
you may find interesting.

131
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,875
Do you?

132
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,000
[ZANAC] Unfortunately,
it will be some time before

133
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,500
the streets and buildings
are fully repaired.

134
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:26,333
Jaldabaoth did quite
a bit of damage.

135
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,583
[RENNER]
Tell me, brother.

136
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,791
Do we have any idea what
happened to the people

137
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,958
the demons took as prisoners?

138
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,625
We're looking into the matter.

139
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,708
All we're certain of now
is that almost 100,000 people

140
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,708
were somehow taken
without a trace.

141
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,583
How terrible.

142
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,833
Father. Do not be discouraged.

143
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:49,416
Across the land, the people
are praising your leadership,

144
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,250
and working hard
on the restoration.

145
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,083
All thanks to the plans created

146
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,250
and implemented
by you and Renner.

147
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,041
Jaldabaoth was overheard saying

148
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,458
that he was after
a magical item.

149
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,166
The magician's guild
is looking into this.

150
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,083
Finding what he wants
may help us find him.

151
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,458
[MAID 06A]
Please wait!

152
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,750
Huh?

153
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,166
Father, it's good to see you!

154
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,833
Prince Barbro.

155
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,791
Though you're his son,
you cannot enter

156
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,375
the king's presence unannounced.

157
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,041
Be silent, you upstart commoner.

158
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,541
Cheeky peasant.

159
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,458
I ought to have you
thrown in the dungeon.

You'll do no such thing.

Sir Gazef is my Chief Warrior

He spoke only as his
duty requires of him.

Only nobles may become
knights of this kingdom.

164
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,166
It's dangerous to
keep a lowborn man

165
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,833
like him at your side.

We've come to ask why you've
left E-Rantel undefended!

168
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:51,458
That's because the Empire
is not attacking us, brother.

169
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,666
All we know is that
the Empire doesn't plan

170
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,750
to attack us around harvest
as they have in the past.

171
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,583
They must be shifting
the time of their attack

172
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,208
so as to catch us off guard.

173
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,208
Right!

174
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,041
Send me to crush the Empire

175
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,541
and the demon
Jaldabaoth after that.

He was in full-plate armor,

of someone like him.

No way.

she's as good looking

You manage to get any
details on our client?

He's a noble who's said
to be losing favor

with the Bloody Emperor.

251
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,750
However, he's yet
to have any privileges

252
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,458
stripped from him,
so he's still wealthy.

253
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,625
So we know he can pay, then.

254
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,958
He's offering 200 gold
up front and 150 after.

[ROBERDYCK, IMINA gasp]

And can your source be trusted?

[ARCHE] It's true that there's
no evidence of a ruin there

There's a village
fairly close to it.

I'm sure the client wants us
to be as discreet as possible.

274
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,916
Of course. If we do
something careless,

275
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,750
that's it. We'll surely invoke
the wrath of the kingdom.

We get 350 gold even if
nothing's down there.

You know, it is too bad.

But I doubt even this
reward'll be enough

[ARCHE]
That's all right.

302
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,958
As long as I can pay some of it,
the creditors will wait.

Lemme know if you want me
to talk with your father.

I would be happy to offer
the word of God to him.

Although, he'll need to
learn God's anger first.

306
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,875
We might have to poke
a few holes in his ears

before he can hear us.

Uh--

00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,583
This isn't right.
It's their debt.

310

They should pay it themselves.
I'll just take my sisters.

[bell rings]

312

If Ms. Arche takes
in her sisters,

she won't be able to do
dangerous work anymore.

have to retire.

She oughtta be just fine.

00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,166
I mean she's a
third tier magic caster.

318
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,625
There's plenty'a
work in the city

319
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,291
for somebody at her level.

320
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,708
That's a good point.

321
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,791
We're the ones who're
outta luck here.

322
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:08,333
[ROBERDYCK] True. Third tier
magic casters are rare enough.

323
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,625
I doubt we'll ever find another

324
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,916
with that special
talent of hers.

325
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,708
It's a valuable skill.

326
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,250
Just by observing
another magic caster,

327
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:20,250
she's able to tell exactly what
tier of spell they can cast.

328
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,625
I hear Fluder Paradyne

329
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,791

gift as well.

[sighs]

331
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:27,791
I guess we could always recruit

332
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,833
a second tier magic caster
and train 'em up.

333
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:34,333
That sounds like it should
be our last resort.

334
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,791
Yeah, but workin' as a team
of three would be risky.

335
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,625
Unless you two wanna
rejoin the guild.

336
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,166
I fight to save life.

337
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,375
And that goal is ill-aligned
with the rules of the temple.

338
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,250
If it comes to that point,

339
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,416
I expect I would retire myself.

341

[ROBERDYCK]
Oh, I'd be fine with any job

342
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,916
that involved helping people.

343
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,291
I could work the fields
in new villages,

344
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,875
and spread the word
of God to them.

00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,333
Huh, I wonder what I should do.

00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:08,583
Should you really be making
that decision on your own?

right to make that choice.

474
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:43,791
[AINS] I see now. I asked
a truly worthless question.

475
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,250
Forgive me.

476
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:53,250
[AINS] The mercenaries invading
the Great Tomb of Nazarick

477
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:56,583
cannot possibly comprehend
the danger they face.

478
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,875
They shall find the
riches they seek,

479
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,208
but they will have
little use for them...

480
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:02,750
...in death.

481
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,166
Their eyes blinded
by a few baubles,

482
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,750
they journey deeper into
the bowels of Nazarick.

483
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:12,541
They are no better than
maggots looking to feed.

484
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:17,041
Chapter 7: "Butterfly Entangled
in a Spider's Web."

485
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,916
No trespasser shall
escape my grasp.
