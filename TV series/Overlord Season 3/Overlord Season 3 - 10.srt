[CHAMBERLAIN]
The region of Nazarick,

2
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:14,708
under the Sorcerer King
Ains Ooal Gown,

3
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:18,208
is hereby recognized
as a sovereign nation,

4
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:21,375
as well as a friend and
ally of the Empire,

5
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:25,083
by decree of Jircniv
Rune Farlord El Nix,

6
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,083
Emperor of Baharuth.

7
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:28,833
Furthermore,

8
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:32,333
the City of E-Rantel,
as well as the lands around it,

9
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:35,000
belong to Nazarick,
yet are currently held

10
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,083
by the Re-Estize Kingdom.

11
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:40,875
These lands should be returned
to their original owner at once.

12
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,458
Should this demand be refused,

13
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:46,791
the Empire will be proud
to aid Sorcerer King Gown

14
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:49,458
in the liberation
of his country.

15
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,250
[RAMPOSA] Our historians
have found no mention


16
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,208
of a country known as Nazarick.


17
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,625
Nor of an Ains Ooal Gown
who owned the land


18
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,458
surrounding E-Rantel.

19
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,458
There's not a shred of
legitimacy in this demand.

20
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:36,291
Then it would seem these
are the ravings of a lunatic.

21
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:39,083
As often as they invade,
it only makes sense

22
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,666
they would start
running out of reasons.

23
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,875
That could be the cause.

24
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,416
Now, that said,

25
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,250
I can't help but feel that I've
heard this name once before.

26
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,666
From the Chief
Warrior, I believe.

27
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,708
He is the same magic
caster who saved my life.

28
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,291
Of that I'm sure.

29
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,833
Oh, I see.

30
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,791
And afterwards, did he offer
to let you kiss his royal ring?

31
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:01,875
[NOBLES chuckle]

32
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,916
[UROVANA]
Control yourselves.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,166
You stand before the king.

34
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,833
Well, I doubt we'll need to give

35
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:11,166
much attention to
one magic caster.

36
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,750
If you would permit me to speak.

37
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,916
Their claims are baseless,
their demands unreasonable.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,125
We have no choice
but to go to war.

39
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,208
--[NOBLES gasp]
--[NOBLE 10F] Hear! Hear!

40
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,375
But then...

41
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,208
Chief Warrior Stronoff.

42
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:27,333
I would like for you to share
your opinion on the matter.

43
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,041
Your Grace.

44
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,166
In my humble opinion,

45
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,250
this war will not
be ended so easily

46
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,333
as the annual wars
that have preceded it.

47
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,708
Do you have a reason?

48
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,125
Yes.

49
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,000
It's because we'll be fighting
the great magic caster,

50
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,958
Ains Ooal Gown.

51
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,916
My king. How important
is E-Rantel?

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,750
I think, if possible, we should
cede it without resisting.

53
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,000
[gasps]

54
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:01,458
[laughs] A rare thing
to hear the Kingdom's

55
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,500
Chief Warrior speak
like a whipped pup.

56
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,416
Though the idea itself
is not without merit.

57
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,625
We could potentially
avoid a costly war

58
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,833
simply by ceding a single city.

59
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,000
It's a king's duty
to protect his people

60
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,458
from needless suffering.

61
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,333
Would a true king
not be willing to make

62
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,750
such an honorable sacrifice?

63
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,875
Before letting his
people suffer?

64
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,416
Well said indeed!

65
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,083
[BLUMRUSH] That land is under
direct control of the king.

66
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,250
If you think it right that he
give that land to the enemy,

67
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,250
then why not offer your own?

68
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,958
Chief Warrior, your
words invite needless

69
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,125
suspicion as to your allegiance.

70
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,750
[ROYAL 10E]
Yes, quite right. So they do!

71
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,500
The loyalty of my Chief Warrior

72
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,416
has been tested and proven.
It's beyond dispute.

73
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,583
This magic caster
must be strong enough

74
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,250
to warrant such words

75
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,625
I appreciate your counsel,

76
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,333
but I can't simply
cede E-Rantel.

77
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,958
A ruler cannot give up
his cities freely.

78
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,125
It's my duty to protect them.

79
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:57,250
Your Grace, forgive me for
speaking so foolishly.

80
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:01,000
[RAEVEN] War is inevitable.
Let's speak practically.

81
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:04,708
First, as this is a matter
of the defense of Re-Estize,

82
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,250
we all must prepare
to lend our aid.

83
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,500
But, Marquis Raeven,
only His Majesty--

84
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,333
That's enough. Just think.

85
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,625
If His Majesty's army
should fall,

86
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,833
why would the Empire stop
at taking E-Rantel?

87
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,708
Assisting his majesty in
the defense of the Kingdom

88
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:21,833
is the logical choice.

89
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,708
All of our lands
are at stake here.

90
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,750
Of course.

91
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,083
You only think about
your own gain.

92
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,375
I say it is the duty
of any noble to stand

93
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,333
with His Majesty in battle.

94
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,583
I concur.

95
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,250
My blade is the king's
to use as he sees fit.

96
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,166
[GAZEF] Since His Majesty
drove out Jaldabaoth,

97
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,458
the Royal Faction has grown
in strength considerably.

98
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:45,791
That's why it's essential

99
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:49,750
that he maintain his image
as a strong king. But...

100
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,166
Then it's agreed that
we shall go to war,

101
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,333
but we should delay
our formal response

102
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:58,791
for as long as we can.

103
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,291
[CHAMBERLAIN]
Yes, Your Grace.

104
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,958
I believe we can delay the war
for as long as two months.

105
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,375
While the Empire awaits
our declaration of war,

106
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,875
we'll gather our
troops in E-Rantel.

107
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,958
I'll go as well, of course.

108
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,958
And it would be my honor
to accompany you, Father.

109
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,625
That seems a bit
reckless, brother.

110
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,375
You're first in line to
inherit the crown, remember?

111
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,291
I should be the one--

112
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,458
No!

113
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,250
Ah--

114
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,666
Prince Barbro.

115
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,083
You're a valuable heir
to the throne,

116
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,875
as well as the fiancé
of my own dear daughter.

117
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,541
Shall I cower here
while my father fights?

118
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:37,375
[BOULLOPE] No, it's right for a
man to prove himself in battle.

119
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,333
I shall send my finest
soldiers with you.

120
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,583
I believe 4,000 will suffice.

121
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,833
Truly?

122
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,958
[BOULLOPE]
Is that acceptable, Your Grace?

123
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,708
Yes. By all means.

124
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,916
You have my thanks, Father!

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,291
I'll cleave the head
from El Nix's shoulders

126
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,625
and bring it to you on a plate!

[RAEVEN growls]
That idiot prince!

130
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,458
He'll "cleave the head
from El Nix's shoulders."

131
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,041
Every last one of them's
a damn imbecile.

132
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,291
How can they not see the
danger our kingdom is in?

133
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,208
The nobles would rather fight
each other than the Empire.

134
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,750
Marquis Blumrush is
the worst of them.

135
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,500
He's selling the Kingdom's
secrets to the Empire.

136
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,208
Even the king himself.

137
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,541
At least he has compassion
for his people,

138
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,125
but he doesn't use
his head at all!

139
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:32,041
[sighs] If Prince Zanac doesn't
inherit the throne quickly,

140
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,958
this squabbling will never end.

141
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,625
The king knows that
as well as I do,

142
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,458
but he lacks the guts
to disinherit Barbro.

143
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,166

Yes, what is it?

It's detrimental to
a child's development

155

to speak to them in such
a diminutive manner.

Ha! Rubbish!

about to have dinner!

161
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,375
[RAEVEN]
Oh, boy!

162
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,375
It's one of your
favorite foods, Papa!

163
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,208
[RAEVEN]
Wow! That makes me so happy!

164
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,083
So what is for dinner?

165
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,541
[RAEVEN'S WIFE]
It's <i>Gabura</i> fish <i>meuniere</i> .

166
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,500
I see.

167
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,833
[gasps] Little Lee?
What's wrong?

168
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,000
I wanted to be the
one who told you.

169
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,625
Oh. That's all Papa's fault!

170
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,541
I'm sorry, little Lee.

171
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,666
Why did you tell me?

172
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,583
[sighs]

173
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,166
[RAEVEN]
Sorry, little Lee.

174
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,541
Papa's so silly,
he already fogot!

175
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,041
Will you tell me
what we're eating?

176
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,291
[LEE]
Mm...

177
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,166
C'mon, why won't you tell me?

178
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,166
Papa's about to cry!

179
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,333
[LEE]
No! Don't cry, um...

180
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,958
It's that fish you like, Papa!

181
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:01,291
Oh, yeah? Wow! Papa's so happy!

182
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,333
Papa loves you.

183
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,875
And he wants to give his little
Lee the very best in life.

184
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,958
So he's gonna work
as hard as he can.

185
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,083
[RAEVEN] Everyone.
Thanks to your hard work,

186
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,875
preparations for
war are complete.

187
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,750
Now, we must discuss
our strategy

188
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,833
for the battle to come.

189
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,166
Three days ago,

190
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,916
the Emperor sent us
a missive stating

191
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,708
where his army will await us.

192
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,916
[BOULLOPE]
Is it not the same as always?

193
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,875
[RAEVEN] Yes, we'll fight
in the cursed fog

194
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,458
of the Katze Plains yet again.

195
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,375
Then can we assume that
they'll be employing

196
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,458
their usual tactics?

197
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:52,958
Unfortunately, Marquis Blumrush,
I don't believe that's likely.

198
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:56,416
I sent my subordinates, a team
of ex-Orichalcum adventurers,

199
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,833
to scout their army.

200
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:01,083
They reported seeing six
different coats-of-arms.

201
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,541
--[NOBLES gasp]
--[BLUMRUSH] So many!

202
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,500
[RAEVEN] For every two men
they brought last year,

203
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,583
they've brought another.

204
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,875
This is three-fourths
of their army.

205
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,125
In addition, we can
expect the magic caster

206
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,708
Ains Ooal Gown to
fight beside them.

207
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,875
Heh. A single magic caster
can't sway the results

208
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,666
of this battle, no matter
how strong he is.

209
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,541
Well, to be safe,
I think we should estimate

210
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,375
that he has the strength
of 5,000 footsoldiers.

211
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,125
--[NOBLES gasp]
--[LYTTON] What? Why so many?

212
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,708
I would equate the strength
of Chief Warrior Stronoff

213
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,500
to that of 1,000 soldiers.

214
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,416
If this caster has a
warrior like him on guard,

215
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,125
five times that
number seems right.

216
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:41,166
I trust the eyes
of the Chief Warrior.

217
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,250
I appreciate it.

218
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,583
Your Grace.

219
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,416
In regards to this so-called
Sorcerer King Gown.

220
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,541
It's said that he once
saved Carne Village

221
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,625
from a group of raiders.

222
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,541
We should send some
soldiers there to gather

223
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,583
information from the villagers.

224
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,375
I think we should give this
responsibility to the prince.

225
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,250
Marquis!

226
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,708
A fine idea, Marquis Boullope.

227
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,208
But, Father!

228
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,166
Go, my son. This is my command.

229
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,291
You are to travel
to Carne Village at once

230
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,541
and question the
people living there.

231
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:18,333
[BARBRO] If that is your
order, then I must obey.

232
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,875
[BOULLOPE] I have one more
question, Your Majesty.

233
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,541
Have you decided who
should lead our forces

234
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,083
in the battle to come?

235
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,833
I believe I would be the
most fitting candidate.

236
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,416
[ALL gasp]

237
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,208
Marquis Raeven.

238
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,208
Yes.

239
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,458
[RAMPOSA]
I shall leave it to you.

240
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,125
Your Majesty.

241
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,041
Marquis Raeven.

242
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,083
My troops will be in your care.

243
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,583
Tell me if you need anything.

244
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,791
You have my gratitude.

245
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,083
[RAMPOSA]
Any other matters to resolve?

246
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,916
Very well, then prepare
yourselves for battle.

247
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,708
[RAMPOSA grunts]

248
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,208
You handled that
well, Your Grace.

249
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,958
Good. Because it took
a lot out of me.

250
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,833
[chuckles]

251
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,750
My son is headstrong
and foolish.

252
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,625
He aches for battle,
but I can't stand

253
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,791
the thought of losing him.

254
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:27,125
I believe that Marquis Boullope
aims to protect him, too.

255
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,958
I believe this
as well. He's loyal.

256
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,250
There's no doubt in my mind
he wishes for Barbro

257
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,875
to inherit the crown.

258
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,291
I see. So then he
came up with the mission

259
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,000
because, if the prince
fought in this battle,

260
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,166
he'd have trouble
protecting him.

261
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,333
This battle could end us.

262
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,875
I should've dealt with
Baharuth long ago.

263
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,166
Before the nobles
split into factions

264
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,125
and started nipping
at each other's throats.

265
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:55,416
I wish only to leave a
good and strong kingdom

266
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,375
to the child who succeeds me.

267
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:02,250
I wonder. Is this not
my best chance?

268
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:06,291
My waning influence has resurged
in the wake of Jaldabaoth.

269
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,500
For the first time in decades,
we're a kingdom united.

270
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:13,416
Perhaps we'll win this battle
and earn a few years of peace.

271
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,208
Your Grace.

272
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,416
[door opens]

273
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,250
Marquis Raeven, I was
hoping you'd return.

274
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,541
I'm sorry for giving
you this burden.

275
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,333
Not at all. I'm honored
to do it, Your Grace.

276
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,916
And it would have been foolish
to allow Marquis Boullope

277
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,541
to lead our forces.

278
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:32,916
The only commands that one knows
are "attack" and "retreat."

279
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,125
Furthermore, if you'd
said you would command

280
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:38,125
the army yourself, the
Noble Faction would resist.

281
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,458
Many might have pulled
out their soldiers.

282
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,916
As such,

283
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,833
I turned out to be the only
viable candidate you had.

284
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,625
Although, I confess,
this will be exhausting.

285
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,666
I'd appreciate it if
Your Grace would allow me

286
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,666
to retire to my lands
for a few months--

287
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,833
once the war is
finally over, that is.

288
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,541
I should've asked you.

289
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,500
Please, I owe you this much.

290
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,250
There were plenty of
times that I've acted

291
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,958
without receiving
your permission.

292
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,916
And I feel that I could've taken
measures to prevent this.

293
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,541
Chief Warrior Stronoff.

294
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,958
Out of ignorance, I thought
you were a dishonorable man.

295
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,708
Now I understand
your good intentions.

296
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,250
You needn't apologize
for such a thing.

297
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,916
So raise your head, please.

298
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,791
[GAZEF] I must be made to
atone for my foolishness.

299
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,083
Or this guilt will never cease!

300
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,500
Well, if you insist.

301
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,625
Then atone by allowing
me to henceforth

302
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,583
call you Master Gazef
instead of Chief Warrior.

303
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:33,958
[gasps]

304
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,875
I never knew you well.

305
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,833
But I've always had
respect for you.

306
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,708
You have my thanks.

307
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,083
[RAEVEN] Now that we're
all on good terms.

308
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,958
I was hoping we might discuss
the Kingdom's future.

309
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,500
And how to win this war.

310
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,000
[GAZEF] How many of these
men will come back alive?

311
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,916
[GAZEF] Is it not the
duty of those who stand

312
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,041
on top to protect the people?

313
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,000
[GAZEF]
Ains Ooal Gown.

314
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,458
What could that man be thinking?

315
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:24,791
All I know is that he is not
a man I'd want to fight.

316
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,000
[gasps]

317
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,125
[gasps]

318
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,166
I take it the
adventurers have decided

319
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,375
to stay out of this battle?

320
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,541
Guess so.

321
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:45,916
With the exception
of Lockmeyer's group--

322
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,208
They all work for
Marquis Raeven now.

323
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,500
I see.

324
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,708
Hey, Lord Stronoff--

325
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,958
Just call me Gazef.

326
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,375
Well, Climb.

327
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,958
You allowed me to sneak up
behind you in plate armor.

328
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,333
Which tells me you're slacking.

329
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,416
Oh. My apologies, sir!

330
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,166
It's all right to relax
every now and then.

331
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,666
You noticed me from
across the street.

332
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,333
Of course, I did.

333
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,958
You were letting your presence
ooze out all over the place.

334
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,291
[GAZEF]
Climb.

335
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,333
When you're protecting
Princess Renner,

336
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,708
you should be aware
of such presences.

337
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,083
So that's what you're on about.

338
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,291
Listen, Climb.

339
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,000
Since you're usually
training on your own,

340
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:28,083
it can be difficult to sharpen
those kinds of senses.

341
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,583
Not all of your enemies'll
wanna come at you head-on

342
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,250
with a sword in hand.
Make sense?

343
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,208
[CLIMB]
As you say.

344
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,583
Gazef, thank you for
bringing this shortcoming

345
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:40,125
to my attention.
I'll train harder.

346
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,541
It's fine.

347
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,291
As the princess's guard,
you're one of my subordinates.

348
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,666
This is my fault.

349
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,916
I should've trained you more,

350
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,458
but I was worried the
nobles would see us.

351
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,333
Even now, I'm leaving
that duty to another.

352
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,875
There's no need for thanks.

353
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,666
So, hey. Are you two
free right now?

354
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,708
[GAZEF]
Tell me.

355
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,666
What were the two of you
doing over there?

356
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,416
[BRAIN] Oh, we went to pay
a visit to Momon of Darkness.

357
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,666
Did you now?

358
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,333
I hear that he recently
made E-Rantel his home.

359
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,583
[BRAIN]
Right.

360
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,500
We heard the same, so we
went back to his place

361
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,458
to see if he'd give
us some advice.

362
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:20,750
About Shalltear Bloodfallen,
the vampire.

363
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,875
On the same day and not
far from where I first

364
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,666
met that monster...

365
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,125
[BRAIN] ...Momon took
down a Honyopnyoko.

366
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,458
Honyopnyoko, huh?

367
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:32,916
I heard about that.

368
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,583
The thing sounded
incredibly dangerous.

369
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:39,333
I believe Momon defeated it
with a legendary magic item.

370
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,791
You did your research.

371
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:44,208
Apparently Momon was trying
to hunt down two vampires.

372
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,083
Which leads me to believe
that the one he didn't

373
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,708
take down was
Shalltear Bloodfallen.

374
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,041
Good guess.

375
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,500
So, what did he have to say?

376
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,625
Well. Not a lot.
He wasn't at home.

377
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:59,166
That's unfortunate.
He could've been helpful.

378
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,500
I'd like to speak with
this Momon myself someday.

379
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,125
Talk about an amazing view.

380
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,666
Yeah, it's none too
rough on the eyes.

381
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,416
[CLIMB]
Those are the Katze Plains.

382
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,208
We'll be fighting there soon.

383
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,958
[GAZEF]
They're less pleasant up close.

384
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,041
The undead wander
through that fog.

385
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,708
Those fields are
stained with blood.

386
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,791
[exhales]

387
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:31,500
[BRAIN] So, why'd you bring
us to such an isolated spot?

388
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,833
[gasps]

389
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,708
Is there a noble that you
need us to do away with?

390
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:36,625
[BOTH gasp]

391
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,166
[BRAIN]
Gazef. I owe you a lot.

392
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,833
I would do dirty work
for you in a heartbeat.

393
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,666
Well, I appreciate that. But no.

394
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,291
I didn't bring you here
to ask for something.

395
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,750
I just figured that,
before the battle,

396
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,666
it'd be nice to talk alone.

397
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,416
That's it?

398
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,666
For an army big-shot,
you've got a lot of free time.

399
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,000
By the way.

400
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,458
Hey, Climb. I had
a question for you.

401
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,791
[CLIMB]
Sir?

402
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,208
You're gonna stand out
with that armor of yours.

403
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,833
Have you considered
changing the color

404
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,458
before you head into battle?

405
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,500
[CLIMB]
I truly appreciate your concern.

406
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,083
But I can't do as you say.

407
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:20,333
If I fight well in armor
as conspicuous as this,

408
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,916
then my deeds will be noted,
and Princess Renner's

409
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,166
reputation will be improved.

410
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,541
For a goal like that,

411
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,291
I'm more than willing
to risk my life.

412
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,708
Also, Princess Renner
has requested

413
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,541
that I go into battle
without changing my armor.

414
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,416
I see. Then, do as you will.

415
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,666
I know you like
to worry, but don't.

416
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,541
I'll be right beside
Climb the whole battle.

417
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:46,166
Whatever danger he leaps into,
I'll pull him back out.

418
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,375
The Four Imperial
Knights are strong.

419
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:51,166
That said, you could
best any of them.

420
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,291
However, you should be wary.

421
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,083
Because if you come
before Ains Ooal Gown.

422
00:19:57,166 --> 00:20:00,041
He will surely be
the end of you.

423
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,916
I'll keep an eye out.

424
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,583
He's really that powerful?

425
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,041
Yes.

426
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:12,083
Duly noted. Appreciate
the heads up.

427
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,958
[GAZEF] There's a pub I
like back at the capital.

428
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:19,708
We can celebrate there
once this war is over.

429
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,416
You mean once we've
sent those Imperials

430
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,916
running for the hills, right?

431
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,833
Oh, did you mean me as well?

432
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,416
[GAZEF]
It'll be my treat.

433
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,708
[BRAIN]
Say, Climb. Are you a drinker?

434
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,958
Frankly, I've never
actually had a drink.

435
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,208
That so?

436
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,958
Well, then this'll be
part of your training.

437
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:40,375
There'll be times when you're
socially obliged to drink.

438
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,458
I'd say you should get
drunk at least once

439
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,250
so you know how it feels.

440
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,583
That makes sense.

441
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,375
Then I'll accompany you both.

442
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,500
Well, after the fight,

443
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,083
the three of us should
meet here again.

444
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,666
So do your best to stay alive.

445
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:02,333
[CARVAIN] We pay our respects
to the Sorcerer King!

446
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,791
[AINS]
I appreciate your kind welcome.

447
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,125
Your Majesty.

448
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,791
I am known as
Sir Nimble Arc Dale Anoch.

449
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,625
It's my honor to serve
as your guide.

450
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,333
[AINS]
I'll be in your care then.

451
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:20,666
Forgive me for any trouble
I might cause you.

452
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm General Carvain.
Pleasure to meet you.

453
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,916
First off, I would
like to thank you

454
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,958
for assisting my regiment.

455
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:31,041
We're honored to have
you fighting beside us.

456
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,208
[AINS] It was Emperor
Jircniv's request.

457
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,250
I'm glad I accepted.

458
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,375
By the way, I hear
you wish to signal

459
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:40,416
the battle's start
with one of my spells.

460
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,916
If that is the case,

461
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,833
might I bolster our ranks with
a portion of my own army?

462
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:49,083
That would be a great help
and honor, Your Grace.

463
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,250
However, we plan to
attack the Kingdom

464
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,541
as early as the day after next.

465
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,541
[AINS]
That won't be a problem.

466
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,500
Can you hear me, Shalltear?

467
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,875
Open a gate right behind me.

468
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,541
I have need of my soldiers.

469
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,958
[AINS]
This is my army!

470
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,125
Damn it. Marquis Raeven.

471
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:38,333
I should be the one to
inherit Father's crown.

472
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:41,041
But he sided with my brother.

473
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,291
I should be distinguishing
myself in battle,

474
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:46,458
but instead I've been
sent on a child's errand.

475
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:47,541
Hold on.

476
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:50,083
Could it be that Father
wants to stop me

477
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,541
from proving myself?

478
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,416
[CHENEKO]
Prince Barbro.

479
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,666
Are you feeling ill,
Your Highness?

480
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,416
No. I feel fine.

481
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,166
I'm thinking on our mission

482
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,000
and how best we
might complete it.

483
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:03,416
Have you any thoughts,
Baron Cheneko?

484
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,250
Not at this time, Highness.

485
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:08,333
I'll leave such weighty
matters to the future king.

486
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,833
You.

487
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,666
Yes, Your Highness?
What are you orders?

488
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,458
We need to hurry.

489
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:18,291
Let's double our pace
and reach Carne quickly.

490
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:19,541
This way,

491
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:22,208
we'll finish our job,
return tomorrow night,

492
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,166
and then we can
take a short nap.

493
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,125
And head to the Katze Plains
before the morning sun rises.

494
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:30,125
[KNIGHT 10A]
But out of our 5,000 soldiers,

495
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,958
4,500 are on foot.

496
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,208
At that pace,

497
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,458
some of them will
collapse from exhaustion.

498
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,583
That's an order I just gave you.

499
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:41,000
We must bring down
the Empire's army.

500
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:44,083
Defeat at the Katze Plains
is not an option.

501
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:47,166
Make them run.
Whip them if you must!

502
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,791
[KNIGHT 10A]
As you command.

503
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,541
[AINS] With the forces of
the Empire and Kingdom

504
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:53,875
about to clash,

505
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:57,125
5,000 royal troops arrive
at Carne Village.

506
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:00,625
This detachment is lead
by the first prince, Barbro.

507
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:03,166
After receiving
Lupisregina's report,

508
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,333
I watch over the town by
means of a magic mirror.

509
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,583
Against such an
overwhelming force,

510
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:11,125
the town's defenders
have no chance.

511
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:14,041
The village will surely
be forced to surrender.

512
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:17,416
Chapter 11: "Another Battle."

513
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,000
Wait. What in the world
just happened?!
