1
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:16,125
[BARBRO]
How dare they march me out

2
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,291
to the middle of
nowhere like this!

3
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:22,166
Carne Village is scarcely
worthy of my attention.

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,833
But I won't let them
rob me of my glory.

5
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,958
I'll wrap things up
in short order,

6
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,791
then march straight to the
Katze Plains for battle.

7
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:33,250
Wait. Maybe this
place isn't useless!

8
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,166
I might be able
to use the villagers

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,833
to negotiate with Gown.

10
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:39,625
If he backs out of the war,
the Empire will retreat

11
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:41,791
without so much as a skirmish.

12
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,250
This is my chance to prove
that I'm worthy of the throne.

13
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:48,333
That I'm the only choice!

14
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,250
No, even better.

15
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,375
I'll draft the
villagers as soldiers

16
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:55,583
and march them
before Gown himself.

17
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,333
If he ends up killing them,

18
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,500
he'll show what
kind of man he is.

19
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:02,333
All his support will be lost.

20
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:06,791
A splendid plan. Just perfect.

21
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,958
[AGU]
Hello, Chief, we've returned.


22
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,625
[GOBLIN 11A]
Greetings, Chief.


23
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,125
[GOBLIN 11B]
Greetings.

24
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:48,375
Yeah, greetings to
you, too. Nice work.

25
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,875
So, what are you up
to right now, Chief?

26
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,375
I'm preparing for winter.

27
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,958
Making sure we have enough
supplies for everyone.

28
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,125
You have the firewood
under control.

29
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:00,125
Tell us if you need
anything else. 'Kay, Chief?

30
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,125
[forced laughter]

31
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,250
Oh, hello, Chief!

32
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,083
Keep up the good work, Chief!

33
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,000
[forced laughter]

34
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,708
Well, if it isn't the chief!

35
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,375
Have you spoken to the
new villagers joining us?

36
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,000
[ENRI] If one more person
calls me "Chief,"

37
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,000
I am going to scream!

38
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,458
We need to check on
the dried grass.

39
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,375
Try to hang in there till
we're done with our inventory.

40
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,541
Considering that so many
people think I can crush

41
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,416
a barghest with my bare hands,
I suppose the least I can do

42
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,000
is take stock of our
supplies properly.

43
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,666
But, Chief, you...

44
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,666
I mean, Enri--
You're pretty tough!

45
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,375
[KAIJALI]
What?!

46
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,583
[OGRES gasp]

47
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,958
Wow, so it is true!

48
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,875
You are strong enough
to crush a barghest,

49
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,125
just like everyone says!

50
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,625
[gasps]

51
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,708
Chief so strong.

52
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,916
Chief so great.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,375
I knew you could do it, sis!

54
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,208
[sighs]

55
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,750
[laughs] After that,
the ogres all wanted

56
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,250
to arm-wrestle you, too.

57
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,166
Okay, enough.

58
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,166
Ah-- I'm sorry.

59
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,416
[gasps] You smell really
nice! What is that?

60
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,083
Just something I cooked up.

61
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,750
I'm glad you like it, though.

62
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,291
I haven't made much
cologne before.

63
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,333
Wow!

64
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,166
It'll sell for a
fortune in the city!

65
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,000
I mean, maybe, but that's
not really why I...

66
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,416
What's this pose?
You wanna wrestle?

67
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,083
Here we go!

68
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,500
[yelps]

69
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,916
[JUGEM]
Bad news, Miss Enri!

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,416
[BOTH gasp]

71
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,166
[JUGEM]
Oh, sorry for the interruption.

72
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,458
It's an emergency.

73
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,500
[AINS] The royal army
came to Carne Village?

74
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,000
[LUPISREGINA]
Yes, my lord.

75
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,833
The first prince, Barbro,
suddenly appeared at their gates

76
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,375
with 5,000 soldiers.

77
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,833
[AINS]
To what end?

78
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,458
[LUPISREGINA] He claims he's
here to question villagers

79
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,625
who have come into
contact with you.

80
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,750
But I believe his true intention
is to hold the village hostage

81
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,333
in hopes you'll surrender
before the battle

82
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,250
with the Empire starts.

83
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,458
[AINS] The royal army
may not be strong,

84
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,416
but 5,000 soldiers
is overwhelming.

85
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,333
Carne's goblins and ogres
won't be enough

86
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,000
to turn them away.

87
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,000
How are they responding to this?

88
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,958
It seems that the
villagers are just trying

89
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,291
to buy time right now.

90
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,833
[CHENEKO] I have come as
a vassal of the first prince

91
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:52,458
of Re-Estize, Barbro Andrean
Ield Ryle Vaiself!

92
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,125
We have a matter of great
importance to discuss!

93
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,708
Open this gate immediately!

94
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,916
[ENRI] I'm sorry, but there's
cow dung everywhere inside here.

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,166
We can't possibly let a prince
visit until we clean it up!

96
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,791
[CHENEKO]
What?!

97
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,500
Enri is holding them
off at the gate.

98
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:10,250
In the meantime, the goblins
and ogres are hiding.

99
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,833
Oh, no! I've got
dung on my hands!

100
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,041
I'll wash them and come back!

101
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,625
[AINS] She seems to be
handling this well.

102
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,750
[MOMONGA] I wonder if
Demiurge planned for this?

103
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,041
I'll just have
to act like I knew

104
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,791
it would happen or something.

105
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,500
Either way, the village
itself isn't a big deal.

106
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:26,916
I just don't want
anyone finding out

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,750
about our potion experiments.

108
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,500
[AINS] Lupisregina, continue
to monitor the village

109
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,916
and tell me every last detail.

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,791
There are four people
you must protect.

111
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,291
You know who they are.

112
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,791
Of course, my lord.

113
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,250
[CHENEKO] We have heard word
that you're connected

114
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:47,583
to the rebel forces
of Ains Ooal Gown!

115
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,708
If you will not cooperate,
that must be the case!

116
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:54,750
If these accusations are false,
prove it and open the gate!

117
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,708
[BARBRO]
Hah.

118
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,625
Enough of this. They've given
us all the proof we need.

119
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,500
Burn this place to the ground!

120
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,708
Please, my lord!

121
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,333
If we're forced to kill
this many civilians,

122
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,458
surely our morale
will suffer for it.

123
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:11,375
Tch. Fine. Then
strike the tower.

124
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,583
Burn it down and they'll
get the message.

125
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,333
Now no one will die.
That good enough?

00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,541
[VILLAGER 11C]
Are they going to kill us?

129
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,791
This village wouldn't
have survived

130

if it wasn't for
Lord Gown's help.

I'm not going to betray him,
no matter the cost.

somethin' with us,

All right, everyone.

We have enough
villagers gathered here.

Let's take a vote
while we still can.

[VILLAGERS grunt]

Who thinks we should meet
the prince's demands?

In that case, even though
it may cost us our lives,

who thinks we should resist
the kingdom's forces?

Yeah!

Let us pay back our debt
to Lord Ains Ooal Gown!

All right. We need
a plan, quick.

[JUGEM]
Your courage is admirable.

But let's be frank.
Us old men are the only ones

153

who should be
risking their lives.

We'd like to have the women
and children evacuate,

but it's too late for that.

The prince's forces have already
gathered at the back gate.

157
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,291
We'll make it work.

Just open up the front gate,

The first horn summoned goblins

this horn act differently.

It's called the Horn

That could be a clue.

363
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,333
Like, it normally
summons weak goblins,

364

but if you meet
certain conditions,

it summons a whole army?
