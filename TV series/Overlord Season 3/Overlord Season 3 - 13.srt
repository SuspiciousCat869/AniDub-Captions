1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,666
[BOTH gasp]

2
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:21,083
[AINS]
Are you certain?

3
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,583
[GAZEF]
Of course.

4
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:26,083
[AINS]
You will die.

5
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:30,750
Fortunately, I came
here prepared to die.

6
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,083
[AINS] Then what are you
hoping to accomplish?

7
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:38,875
All that stands before you on
this path is your destruction.

8
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:43,500
What stands before me now
is the commander of my enemies.

9
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:46,000
Therefore, my course is clear.

10
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,000
[AINS]
I may be close in proximity,

11
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:51,291
but my power is far
beyond your reach.

12
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:02,750
[AINS] You can't even
react in time to dodge.

13
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,750
That is but a fraction
of what I'm capable of.

14
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,875
Knowing that, do you
really think you have

15
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:12,458
any hope of winning?

16
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,708
[GAZEF]
It's possible, Master Gown.

17
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,333
[AINS] Do you think
yourself invincible because

18
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:21,416
I have no desire to kill you?

19
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,250
I assure you, the thought
never crossed my mind.

20
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,916
I merely wish to fulfill
my duty as Chief Warrior

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,041
of the Kingdom. Surely
that's not a surprise.

22
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,875
[AINS] If you face me, know
that I will strike you down

23
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,375
without hesitation.

24
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:38,041
And I assure you, your
demise will be absolute.

25
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,708
I expect so.

26
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:41,958
[AINS]
A shame.

27
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:44,750
I'm something of a
collector, so it pains me

28
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:48,208
to kill someone so
rare and valuable.

29
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:53,000
In the name of my Kingdom,
as Chief Warrior,

30
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:56,875
I challenge the Sorcerer King,
Ains Ooal Gown to a duel!

31
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:59,083
I harbor no regrets!

32
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,500
Come! Let us end this!

33
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,833
[CLIMB]
No.

34
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,500
[BRAIN]
Gazef.

35
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:21,458
Before we formally begin,
one last thing.

36
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,583
Why don't we have these two
serve as witnesses to our duel?

37
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:25,583
[BOTH gasp]

38
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:26,375
[AINS]
Hm.

39
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,666
[BRAIN]
No, please wait!

40
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,708
I beg of you, Lord Gown.

41
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,916
Although I know this
is a selfish request,

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,583
let me fight beside him!

43
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:38,166
Even with us both, we can
hardly match your strength.

44
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,125
So surely, you will allow it?

45
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,958
I won't have you do this.

46
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,750
Do you wish to drag my resolve
as a warrior through the mud?

47
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,166
[gasps]

48
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:53,000
[AINS] It's irrelevant.
I'll fight any number of you.

49
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,791
They need not enter this fight.

50
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:58,458
And you need not lay
a finger on them.

51
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,500
[AINS] Those eyes.
I know that look well.

52
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,708
It's the gaze of a man
who has prepared himself

53
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,916
for death, yet steps
forward all the same.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,958
Something I admire.

55
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:13,208
Fine. I accept your conditions.

56
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,000
[AINS] Do you know what I
call this, Master Stronoff?

57
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,083
"PVP"!

58
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,750
[GAZEF]
Thank you.

59
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,750
[AINS] I will be certain
to return your corpse

60
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,083
in perfect condition.

61
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,291
With resurrection
magic you may--

62
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,666
No need.

63
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,125
If this battle ends me,
then so be it.

64
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:48,375
Leave my corpse to lie
amongst my fallen comrades.

65
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:51,291
Lord Stronoff, why?

66
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,458
Let's begin, shall we?

67
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:57,333
My friends. This will
be my final battle.

68
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,083
Watch closely.

69
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,666
[GAZEF] Brain. You'll do
that for me, won't you?

70
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,500
This is his dying wish, Brain.

71
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,375
Then I got no choice.

72
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,791
It's an honor, Gazef.

73
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:22,458
I'm proud to bear witness
to your courage.

74
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,500
I feel the same.

75
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,958
[AINS]
One last thing, Master Stronoff.

76
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,333
May I have a look at
that sword of yours?

77
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,500
[BOTH gasp]

78
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,458
[GAZEF]
Certainly.

79
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,083
[BOTH gasp]

80
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,916
[AINS]
Impressive! A fine blade!

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,916
Master Stronoff,
how much do you know

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,083
about the power of this weapon?

83
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,583
Everything, I believe.

84
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:56,083
Specifically, the edge of this
blade is uncannily sharp.

85
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,083
It's able to cut through
metal as if it were paper.

86
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,541
[AINS]
How unfortunate.

87
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,625
That is a mere fraction of
this sword's true capacity.

88
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:04,708
[GAZEF]
What?

89
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,666
[AINS] The data level,
meaning the level of magic

90
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,500
the sword possesses,
is equivalent to this dagger.

91
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,875
[AINS] As you can see,
a weapon of such weak

92
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:19,416
magical caliber cannot even
leave a scratch on my body.

93
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,458
However, despite your
ignorance, it is possible

94
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,416
to harm me with that sword.

95
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,458
More than that, under the
right circumstances,

96
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,333
one might even kill me with it.

97
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,166
That means we've at least
fulfilled the most

98
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,125
basic requirements of a duel.

99
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:38,291
Now, if I win, may I claim
that sword as a prize?

100
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,916
This is the Kingdom's blade.

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,416
I'd die a disgrace
if someone took it.

102
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,666
[AINS] Hm. I suppose I've
had PVP matches where

103
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,000
both players retained
their items.

104
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,416
I'll allow it.

105
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,333
I'm grateful, Sorcerer King.

106
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,000
[AINS]
This seems a proper distance.

107
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,000
Now, you there,
in the shining armor.

108
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,416
Can you give us
a signal to begin?

109
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,083
Uh--

110
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,083
Do it, Climb. Don't worry.

111
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,291
Yes, of course!

112
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,375
I have some magic
handbells here with me.

113
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,208
Will ringing them be adequate?

114
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,666
[AINS]
Mm.

115
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,083
[GAZEF grunts]

116
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,791
You okay?

117
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,125
A bit nervous, of course.
But I'll be all right.

118
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,458
Good luck, Master Stronoff.

119
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,208
[bells chime]

120
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,208
[GAZEF yells]

121
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,625
[AINS]
One note.

122
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,583
You should always
prepare countermeasures

123
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,583
against time spells.

124
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:03,833
[AINS]
Delay Magic. True Death.

125
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,541
[AINS]
Farewell, Gazef Stronoff.

126
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,291
I'm sorry it had
to end this way.

127
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,000
Wait, what?

128
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:21,750
What did he just do?

129
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,083
I couldn't see.

130
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:26,458
Gazef! Hey! Get up!

131
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,375
[AINS]
He's already dead.

132
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,125
[BOTH gasp]

133
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,958
No, it can't be!

134
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,000
[AINS] Seeing him challenge me
to a battle he couldn't win

135
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,583
reminds me of our first meeting.

136
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,291
In honor of your
Chief Warrior's courage,

137
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,958
I will cease the pursuit
of your forces and withdraw.

138
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:56,416
His body will be returned to you
once it's been purified.

139
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,041
[BRAIN]
No, he wouldn't want that.

140
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,125
We'll take Gazef
home on our own.

141
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,208
We don't need help from you.

142
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,791
[AINS]
If you wish.

143
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:08,041
But be warned that to reverse
the instant death spell I used,

144
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:11,416
low-level resurrection
magic won't be enough.

145
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,625
[AINS] Also, I have a
message for the people

146
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,875
of your kingdom.

147
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,708
I am not unreasonable.

148
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,125
I offer mercy to all
those who bow to me.

149
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,500
[AINS] If you relinquish
E-Rantel to me

150
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,666
within the next few days,
I will prevent these creatures

151
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,291
from running rampant
in your capital.

152
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,666
Inform your king.

153
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,500
If you don't mind,

154
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,166
I'd like to carry Gazef's
body back, myself.

155
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,458
[CLIMB]
Of course.

156
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,541
And although I don't
deserve such an honor.

157
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,208
I'll bring his sword.

158
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,541
[JIRCNIV]
Seventy thousand?

159
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:07,708
[sighs] Absurd. So many
men with one blow...

160
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,083
And at the spell's end,

with the Kingdom's Chief
Warrior, Gazef Stronoff,

Where is Marquis Raeven?

[NOBLE 13C] If he fled, he
should have been here by now!

We were fools to think
we could fight that monster.

You're saying we should just
turn E-Rantel over to him?

00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:47,250
[NOBLE 10C] It's a small price
to pay if it saves our Kingdom!

00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,416
Why, Gazef?

177
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,500
You chose death.

178

And you left me with
this weight in my heart.

179

It's not fair.

There's no need for you

Not when you've lost

Sorry I left all that to you.

00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,500
I wasn't feeling
up to a meeting.

192
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,916
So, do you mind filling
me in on the details?

Sure. Since Prince Barbro
has yet to return,

they're hiring some adventurers
to find out what's keeping him.

They'll form a search party
and head out tomorrow.

Huh.

197
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,166
Then they discussed
the fate of E-Rantel.

198
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,083
The nobles and the
king both agreed.

Seems we're handing it over.

I feel sorry for the king.

201

This won't go well for him.

202

True.

203
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,625
The noble faction will gain
influence because of this.

204
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,750
And the king will grow weak.

[BRAIN]
Hey. Let me ask you.

211
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,916
Why do you think Gazef
requested that duel?

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,208
Huh?

213
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,166
Uh. I mean...

214
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,708
[CLIMB] Maybe I'm being
arrogant, but I think I know.

Go ahead.

216
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,166

Yeah.

224
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,375
He wanted us to return
here with information

225
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,625
so we could plan
a defense someday.

Maybe so. We can try.

I mean, he did put
his faith in us.

[BRAIN] I had hoped I
could fight him someday.

Last time, he defeated me.

But I was always
dreaming of a rematch.

feelings he's left us with?

Wait, no. It's all right. Yeah.

take a walk in the garden?

to my missing brother...

I am always at your service.

It's nothing formal.

an altar has been made

in our battle with the Empire.

these flowers there for me.

refuse to allow it? What then?

I have not asked your

Lord Ains has an extremely
generous proposal for you.

00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,666
He'll grant you the
honor of joining

319
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,791
When someone here
steps out of line,

320
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,625
throwing a rock for example,
you track them down

321
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,375
and give them what they deserve.

322
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,125
We can't encourage
lawlessness after all.

323
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,250
If you do this,

324
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,250
you'll personally
ensure that his rule

325
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,250
brings no harm to any innocents.

326
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,583
Not that Lord Ains wants that.

327
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,625
[AINS] You'd make me into
your watch dog, would you?

328
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,458
I wouldn't put it that way.

329
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,041
You'd be helping the people,
both as a representative

330
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,625
of the city and as
an enforcer of the law.

331
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,125
[AINS]
I will not follow an unjust law.

332
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,291
That's perfectly fine,
as he has no intention

333
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,666
of imposing any.

334
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,250
That said, if you refuse
and raise your sword

335
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,166
against the ruler of this city.

336
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,791
Then you'll leave me
with no choice.

337
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,583
I'll slay you right here.

338
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,416
And some bystanders may
be collateral damage.

339
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,708
[MOTHER 13A, BOY 13A gasp]

340
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,666
[AINS]
Fine!

341
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,625
I'll accept your offer.

342
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,416
But know this, if you
lay so much as a finger

343
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,916
on an innocent citizen
of this city,

344
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,791
you will face this blade.

345
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:43,458
And it will not relent until
all your heads are taken.

346
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,250
[DEMIURGE]
So the subjugation of E-Rantel

347
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,166
went smoothly, I trust?

348
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,125
Everything is proceeding
according to Lord Ains' plan.

349
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,916
Turns out humans are
surprisingly adaptable.

350
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,541
I suppose it's merely
their instinct to survive,

351
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,208
but the weak do tend
to follow the strong.

352
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,583
Either way, it was only
possible because of Momon.

353
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:06,958
Indeed.

354
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,125
Their faith in this fabricated
character shall keep

355
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,208
their fears at bay,
it would seem.

356
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,750
And even better, if they
collect information

357
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,875
for Momon and unite beneath him,

358
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,875
we won't have to worry
about outside enemies

359
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,208
gaining ground.

360
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:22,041
Our supreme leader was
certainly thinking ahead!

361
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,375
For all my scheming,
I'm afraid such thorough

362
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,833
machinations are still
beyond my comprehension.

363
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,208
Yes.

364
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,583
Though I don't lament my
comparably meager intellect.

365
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,541
Rather, I am pleased
to devote it to him

366
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,666
with every fiber of my being.

367
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,583
For he is the ruler of
life and death alike.

368
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,708
The highest existence.

369
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:44,583
And the man who I hope
to call my lover someday.

370
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,541
[AINS]
You may raise your heads.

371
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,625
[AINS] Your efforts have
done me a great honor.

372
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,958
My lord! My Sorcerer King.

373
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,875
We are unworthy of such praise!

374
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,416
It is our pleasure to come
running at your call!

375
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Serving you is the greatest
gift we could ever ask for!

376
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,041
I second those
sentiments wholeheartedly.

377
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,500
My lord, I await
your next order.

378
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,125
I offer you my strength,
my life, and my body,

379
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:22,333
to do with however you see fit,
o' noble Sorcerer King.

380
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,541
[COCYTUS] No matter the trial
and no matter the order,

381
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,416
I shall not hesitate.

382
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,000
So long as we fight for the
glory of the Sorcerer King,

383
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,416
nothing will stop us!

384
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,916
I will give it my best!

385
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,166
And I'll work hard every day!

386
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,875
Great and mighty Sorcerer King,

387
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,583
as the representatives of all
those who serve under you,

388
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,083
we sincerely congratulate you
for the stride you've made

389
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,500
in taking this city.

390
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,375
[AINS]
Thank you for your kind words.

391
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,458
But we are as close as family.

392
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:50,250
Indeed, I consider you the
children of my dearest friends.

393
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,291
Therefore, you need
not hide your hearts

394
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,083
in such stifling formality.

395
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:58,125
No matter my title,
"Ains" will suffice.

396
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:02,250
As you wish, my lord.
My darling Ains.

397
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:08,000
[AINS] Nazarick shall hide
in the shadows no longer.

398
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,250
[AINS] This day shall be
known as the founding date

399
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:16,125
of the Sorcerer Kingdom
of Ains Ooal Gown!
