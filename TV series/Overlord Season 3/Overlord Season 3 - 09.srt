[AURA]
'Kay! Massacre is now complete.

00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,333
Normally, we'd kill everyone
in the castle, too.

00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,625
But, we don't know which
one of you is the emperor,

5
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:33,000
so I guess we'd better hold off.

00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,333
That said, if the emperor
doesn't apologize

00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:37,958
to our lord, we'll destroy
your whole country.

we'll kill you all!

[JIRCNIV]
Ains Ooal Gown... Who is he?

10
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:48,916
No. I don't have
time to analyze.

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,083
Don't attack!

I'm Emperor Jircniv

I wish to talk.

This guy's kinda gutsy.

00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,041
Yeah. I'm surprised
he didn't run.

16
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,875
Well... It seems I've
underestimated our foe.

17
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:04,125
I suppose I'll have to visit

the Great Tomb
of Nazarick myself

if we're to make peace
with its ruler.

Apologies, but we
need you to wake.

[yawns]

23
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,208
I've not taken an
afternoon nap in years.

00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,041
Not since I was a child.

25
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,458
Perhaps I owe
Lord Gown my thanks.

26
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,500
Yeah. You needed a break.

27
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,083
You're always workin'
on one thing or another.

What's that about?

29
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,583
Personally, I think that
Bloody Emperor's to blame.

30
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,333
That's a shame.
I thought you were close.

31
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,791
He's fine, but he pushed
through so many new reforms

32
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,500
that now I can barely
keep up with the man.

33
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,125
Right, Vermillion?

34
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,583
True.

35
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,375
And with all the fat nobles
we've purged from office,

36
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,000
the bureaucracy's been
stretched a bit thin.

[FLUDER, BAZIWOOD chuckle]

38

stupid man he is.

[sighs]

40
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,833
However,

41
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:40,208
if I continue to make laws
at such a hectic pace,

42
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,041
the next emperor will
surely despise me.

43
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,583
[BAZIWOOD]
What do you mean "next emperor"?

44
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,708
Do you plan to take
a lady of Baharuth

45
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:51,250
as your empress, or will
you seek one from outside?

46
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,958
I would prefer someone
from another country.

47
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,583
There's Princess Renner.

48
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,041
Your thoughts?

49
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,875
Her actions have certainly
been praiseworthy,

50
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,041
but there's something
off about her.

51
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,000
I get the unpleasant
feeling that she makes

52
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,916
mistakes deliberately.

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,500
Then have you
considered the Queen

54
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,916
of the Dragon Kingdom?

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,791
She carries the blood of
the Brightness Dragon Lord.

56
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,958
And the Dragon Lords have
access to Wild magic.

57
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:21,875
Imagine casting resurrection
without the loss of life force.

58
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,500
Give me a break, old man.

59
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,541
She's a crone who hides
her age with magic.

60
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,041
Those two are both
the type of women

61
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,916
I despise the most.

[JIRCNIV]
What is it? Come in.

68
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,416
Right.

We're close.

Our scouts have already sighted
the Great Tomb of Nazarick.

71
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,291
Assuming that the report
they gave me is accurate,

72
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,500
maids are stationed outside.

73
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,208
Presumably to welcome
us upon arrival.

00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,833
Really? Maids at a tomb.

75

The place we're about
to see is a world

that is completely
unknown to us.

please come to my side
immediately, Your Majesty.

to that, your knights

time as we can.

safety first and foremost.

Right. I understand.

86

You informed me of this when
you first became my knight.

Yes. It's the deal we struck.

this Ains Ooal Gown really is.

Greetings, Emperor

El Nix of Baharuth. we've
been awaiting your arrival.

92
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,125
We bid you and your
retinue welcome

93
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,625
on behalf of Lord Ains.
I am Yuri Alpha.

94
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,291
And my name's Lupisregina Beta!

95
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,625
Lord Ains has proved himself
a gracious host already

96
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,333
by sending such beauties.

97
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,333
You're a most welcome sight.

98
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,666
Now then.

99
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,166
First, let us correct
this unacceptable weather.

100
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,166
What?

101
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,958
It can't be!

102
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,958
No more clouds. It's
already much warmer.

103
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,083
Speak.

104
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,083
What magic did they just use?

105
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,583
The most basic Control Weather
is a sixth tier spell.

106
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,583
But I believe this magic
to be of an even higher level!

107
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,666
It's simply amazing!

108
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,416
You all must be tired
after your journey.

No. This is impossible!

[HOODED STUDENT 06C]
Th-They're using Death Knights?

112
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,416
[JIRCNIV] Death Knights?
What are these things?

113
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,208
Are they the same as the
undead you're keeping

114
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,500
below the Ministry
of Magic? Answer me!

115
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,583
Yes, but it's
unimaginable that anyone

116
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,541
could control so
many mighty undead!

117
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,291
Majesty. Look.

118
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,541
Uh. Even with all
four of us here,

119
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,041
I have my doubts that we
can beat one of those things.

120
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,416
Stay back. You're in danger.

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,375
You said it's fine
for me to run?

122
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,208
If you think that's for
the best, then feel free.

123
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,125
However, if you do run,

124
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,416
you'll cease to be
one of my knights.

125
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,250
Which would make you uninvited,

126
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,791
much like the Workers
who came here before.

[YURI]
No need to be nervous.

129
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,750
The Death Knights you
see here were created

130
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,916
by the hand of
Lord Ains himself.

131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,666
Created, you say?

132
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,291
Yes. As such, they
are absolutely loyal

133
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,250
to any order he might give them.

134
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,750
You can rest assured
that they'll do

135
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,166
nothing to harm you.

What would you like to do,
Your Majesty? Ha!

140
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,083
[FLUDER laughs]

141
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,500
Shall I teleport the
both of us out of here?

142
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:15,166
I believe it might be possible
for us to escape in that manner.

143
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,375
Of course, that's
assuming the master

144
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,458
of this place allows us to.

145
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,291
That's an interesting
expression, old man.

146
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,375
Let me ask you something.

147
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,875
Did you truly think I'd run?

148
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,416
Of course not--
I should know better.

149
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,333
My Jircniv is much
braver than that.

150
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,041
We've finished
preparing your table.

151
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,375
Please relax and
enjoy yourselves.

152
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,791
Would anyone care for
some ice-cold refreshment?

153
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,833
Tasty!

154
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,666
I've never had
anything like this.

155
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,750
It strikes a perfect balance
between sourness and sweetness.

156
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,333
It's soothing to the heart.

157
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,791
[sighs]

158
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:02,666
I'd say the journey was
worth it just for this.

159
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,375
We thank you for your patience.

160
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,875
Lord Ains has finished
preparing and will see you now.

161
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,916
If you'll please step this way.

162
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:33,500
[JIRCNIV]
Gold. Status. Power.

163
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:38,666
Both military and magical.
Beautiful women, too.

164
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,541
[JIRCNIV] There is absolutely
nothing I could offer

165
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:47,541
this Ains Ooal Gown that
he doesn't already have.

166
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:51,375
There are many who would
equate him to a god.

167
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,916
I'm amazed that
no one's tried to run.

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,833
A "victory" for us

169
00:09:56,916 --> 00:10:00,916
would be to make it home alive,
with the Empire intact.

170
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,041
Excuse me, Lord Ains,
but the Emperor of Baharuth,

171
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,625
Jircniv Rune Farlord
El Nix is here.

172
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,958
He's come in response
to your summons.

173
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,708
[AINS]
Emperor of Baharuth.

174
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,333
Thank you for coming.

175
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,166
I am the master of the
Great Tomb of Nazarick,

176
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,708
Ains Ooal Gown.

177
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,958
I'm pleased to meet
you, Master Ains.

178
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,041
You've been a most
generous host.

179
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,666
Pardon, Lord.

180
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,916
I cannot abide this blasphemy.

181
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,583
These humans stand here
as if they're your equals.

182
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,125
I must correct this.

183
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,750
Prostrate yourselves!

184
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,208
[GROUP gasps]

185
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,500
[AINS]
Enough, Demiurge.

186
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,416
[DEMIURGE]
Uh--

187
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,208
You're free to stand.

188
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,833
[AINS] It was not my
intention to insult you,

189
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,791
but through my inability
to control my subordinate,

190
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,708
I've done just that.

191
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,458
Please forgive me.

192
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,916
I will bow my head if you wish.

193
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,458
[gasps]

194
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,166
There is nothing
to forgive. Worry not.

195
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,041
This is a common occurrence.

196
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,916
Sometimes our vassals
misinterpret us.

197
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
One of my subordinates
has committed

198
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,541
precisely this offense.

199
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,250
I am most embarrassed.

200
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,166
Allow me to present you with
the head of the foolish noble

201
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,458
who sent intruders to your home.

202
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,125
Will you accept it?

203
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,291
[AINS]
I shall.

204
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:32,083
I'm not one for trophies, but I
won't put this gift to waste.

205
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,083
Amazing.

206
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,041
[AINS]
Go. Join the line.

207
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,750
[AINS] Now, Emperor Jircniv
Rune Farlord El Nix.

208
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,625
[JIRCNIV]
Jircniv will suffice.

209
00:11:56,708 --> 00:12:00,000
[AINS]
I see. Emperor Jircniv, then.

210
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,625
Since my subordinate has acted
so rudely towards you,

211
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,166
I in turn will disregard
the trouble your noble

212
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,333
has caused to Nazarick.

213
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,625
[gasps]

214
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,541
[AINS] There is no longer
a need for apology.

215
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,416
You may go home in peace.

216
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,833
[JIRCNIV gasps]

217
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,916
[AINS] We're about to be
rather busy here in Nazarick.

218
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,458
[GROUP gasps]

219
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:23,291
[AINS] Thanks to your noble,
we now realize that trouble

220
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,791
will come to us even
if we keep to ourselves.

221
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,250
Armed with that knowledge,

222
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,291
we shall pre-empt any
aggression that may come.

223
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,041
What exactly is your meaning?

224
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,000
[AINS] I will defeat any
who would dare attempt

225
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,791
to bring harm to
the Tomb of Nazarick.

226
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:42,041
They'll be made to pay
for their arrogance.

227
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,958
This world shall feel my wrath

228
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:48,083
until the quiet
I love has returned.

229
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,916
An admirable goal!

230
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,583
Why don't we form an alliance?

231
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:55,083
As if your pathetic country
could ever be more--

232
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,333
Watch your mouth.

233
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,958
[AINS] Cease this racket.
I demand silence.

234
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,625
Rise up.

235
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,625
Found a country and
rule it as a king.

236
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,916
I can think of no
title more worthy

237
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,750
for the illustrious
Ains Ooal Gown.

238
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,333
My empire will do
all in its power

239
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,958
to assist you in
this great endeavor.

240
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,791
[AINS] What merit do
you see for yourself

241
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,541
in this, Emperor Jircniv?

242
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,708
I wish only to establish
friendly ties with you,

243
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,666
and the great country
you will someday create.

244
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,083
Let us prosper, together.

245
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:35,333
[AINS] I see. Then I
look forward to it.

246
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,750
[JIRCNIV]
What is he thinking?

247
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,833
He's at an
overwhelming advantage.

248
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,375
If he demanded my subservience,

249
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,041
I'd have no choice
but to accept.

250
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,958
I see. This is wonderful.

251
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,000
In that case,
if there is anything

252
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,458
we can provide you now,

253
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,083
ask and it will be yours.

254
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,583
[AINS]
Excellent.

255
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,083
I cannot think of
anything at present.

256
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,166
Though it would be
convenient if I had a way

257
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,291
to contact you quickly.

258
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,000
My secretary can
assist with that.

259
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,583
Meet Loune Vermillion.

260
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:11,541
[AINS] And for my part,
I'll send Demiurge to you.

261
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,250
[AINS]
Since you were so gracious

262
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,875
as to forgive his rude display,

263
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,208
I would like to leave
this matter to him.

264
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,125
Demiurge is one of my
most trusted aides.

265
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,833
I'm sure he can resolve
any issue that might arise.

266
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,916
[JIRCNIV]
He's already moved against us.

267
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,875
Sending a demon that can
control men with its voice.

268
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,083
[AINS] This is the birth
date of a new alliance.

269
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,875
Perhaps we'll make it a holiday.

270
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,500
I quite agree. Let's make it so.

271
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,875
Nothing would please me more.

272
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:51,541
[AINS] Well, the emperor
acted just as expected.

273
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,000
[SHALLTEAR]
Pardon, Lord Ains.

274
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,166
but might I ask
a humble question?

275
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,708
[AINS]
Go on.

276
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,458
[SHALLTEAR] Why are we
treating that human emperor

277
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,541
as an ally when he's clearly
so much weaker than us?

278
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,541
All of our actions
must be justified.

279
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,750
But why can't we simply
take what we want?

280
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,625
[AINS] We could destroy
Baharuth with ease,

281
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,458
but we would be condemned
for our aggression.

282
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:16,291
I'll not have the name of
Ains Ooal Gown sullied so.

283
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,625
[COCYTUS]
I see.

284
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,958
Oh, wow, you were really
thinking ahead, Lord Ains!

285
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:23,541
[laughs] Do all of you truly
believe that the thinking

286
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,500
behind the Supreme One's
plan is that simple? Huh?

287
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,625
[AINS]
Huh?

288
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,791
--[AURA, MARE] Huh?
--[COCYTUS] What?

289
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:30,958
Is there something we missed?

290
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,416
[laughs]

291
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,916
Oh, goodness. Lord Ains.

292
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,833
I think it would be
beneficial to tell Shalltear

293
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,125
and the others
your true intentions.

294
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,958
They affect our
future plans, after all.

295
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,041
[AINS]
As expected of you, Demiurge.

296
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,875
Along with my overseer of
the floor guardians, Albedo.

297
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,875
You've recognized
my true thinking.

298
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,000
[MOMONGA]
The hell is he talking about?

299
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,708
It's amazing to think how
long you've been planning.

300
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,125
I finally see why
you created Momon.

301
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,291
It's brilliant.

302
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,958
Your political acumen
knows no bounds.

303
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,000
[MOMONGA]
Really?

304
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,000
What does Momon
have to do with it?

305
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,708
I still don't grasp
your meaning.

306
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,291
[AINS]
Demiurge.

307
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:12,333
I permit you to explain my plan
as I believe you understand it.

308
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,041
[DEMIURGE]
Yes, My Lord.

309
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:20,750
[JIRCNIV]
Damn.

310
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,833
That was the castle
of a Demon King.

311
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,583
Death was sitting
on that throne.

312
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,750
[JIRCNIV]
But no. I'm not done yet.

313
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,750
We still have a
chance of victory.

314
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:42,125
This Ains Ooal Gown is a
monster among monsters

315
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,500
who can make Death
Knights with ease.

316
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:48,500
Should he become our enemy,
Baharuth will fall.

317

Even if we seek to appease him,

such a being might kill

He's undead, after all.

We're agreed?

The situation is just

I feel the same.

he rules as an

And disregarding his appearance,
he has a king's charisma.

And on top of that,
this fiend is intelligent.

I saw meaning behind every
movement he chose to make.

I've no idea where he
obtained such knowledge,

Fluder's obsessed with magic,
yet he left without protest.

338

Normally he would've
begged to stay behind

new information,

[ALL gasp]

Fluder Paradyne has betrayed me.

That's impossible.
Surely this is but a jest.

355
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:27,375
It's no jest. Just how
reliant upon him are we?

356
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,875
If I strip him of power,

357
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,333
how much damage
will it cause us?

358
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,583
The damage would
be unimaginable.

359
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,875
Fluder represents much
of our strength.

360

No country has a caster
that can match him.

361

Fluder's power is a
great negotiating tool.

362
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,625
If they learn of his demotion,

363
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,000
our neighbors will
feel emboldened.

364

There is much we must accomplish

00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,791
if we're to
overcome this threat.

366
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,333
Our only hope is to gather
together the Empire,

367
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:55,500
the Kingdom, the Theocracy,
the Council State,

368
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,875
and the Holy Kingdom.

369
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,125
We will have to create
a grand alliance,

370
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,208
to fight against Nazarick.

371
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,625
Ostensibly, the Empire will
act as a faithful ally

372
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,458
while we form a resistance.

373
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,666
It's risky.

374
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,333
In the event that our
plan is discovered,

375
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,708
our country will be
the first to fall.

376
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,166
Roles reversed,

377
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,000
I would make an example of
our Empire by destroying it.

378
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,166
Oh, yeah.

That does sound like
somethin' you'd do.

I'll take that as a compliment.

381
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,958
Because of this, the
Empire can't be the first

382
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,166
to suggest an alliance.

383
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,250
The other countries must
band together on their own.

384

And as we await this.

385
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,125
We must seek out an
individual with the power

386
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,000
to threaten Ains himself.

I've seen them
standing by his throne.

Yes. That's how he'll think.

391
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:48,375
We can proceed with confidence
that this is the emperor's plan.

392
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,750
Men of some intelligence,
like himself,

393

are often easier
to read than fools.

394
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,291
So the emperor's plan
is to turn one of us

395
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,250
against the others while
creating an alliance

396
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:00,166
of human kingdoms
behind Lord Ains' back?

397
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,833
Then it's doomed to fail,
'cause none of us

398

would ever betray Lord Ains!

If the Empire's already
planning to betray us

then maybe we should go ahead
and destroy it right now.

into our master's great plan.

[AINS] And in exchange?
What will you give me?

475
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,000
[FLUDER]
Everything!

476
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:16,250
All that I have is at
your disposal, my lord.

477
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,708
I kneel before you, O' Deep One.

478
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:21,750
Wise Master of the Chasm!

479
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,458
Your Grace--

480
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,666
It's fine.

481
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,750
[JIRCNIV] We have to be
both clever and swift.

482
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:45,500
This is no petty border dispute,
but a battle to defend mankind.

483
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:47,958
To protect our future.

484
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:53,416
[AINS] The Baharuth Empire
formally recognizes Nazarick

485
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,000
as a sovereign country

486
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:58,875
lead by the Sorcerer
King Ains Ool Gown.

487
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:02,041
Jirkniv also demands that
E-Rantel and the lands around it

488
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:04,583
be returned to Nazarick.

489
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,708
When the leaders of the
Re-Estize Kingdom meet

490
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:09,833
to discuss thier options,
Gazef advises them

491
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,333
to appease me.

492
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,708
Chapter 10:
"Preparation for War."

493
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:15,958
It's difficult to lead

494
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,875
when those that serve
you are incompetent.
