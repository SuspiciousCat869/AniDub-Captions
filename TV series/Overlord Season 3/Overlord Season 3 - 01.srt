1
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,750
[AINS]
Raise your heads.

2
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,166
[SERVANTS]
Lord.

3
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:25,000
[AINS] You all fulfilled
your roles splendidly

4
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:28,541
during our operation in
the kingdom of Re-Estize.

5
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:34,500
[AINS]
Sebas. Solution. Come forward.

6
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,833
[AINS] I'm certain the
information you gathered

7
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,958
will prove invaluable.

8
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,541
Therefore, I have
decided to honor

9
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:48,083
your diligent efforts
with a reward.

10
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,125
Sebas.

11
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:50,416
Lord.

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,541
[AINS] You asked that
I spare Tuare's life,

13
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,208
and indeed I shall,

14
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,291
but I do so to repay a debt
to a prior associate,

15
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,583
not in response to your efforts.

16
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,583
Therefore I shall grant
you something else

17
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,750
that you desire, as well.

18
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:06,625
[SEBAS] Lord Ains, my only
wish is to devote myself--

19
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:07,958
[AINS]
If you hope to please me,

20
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,458
then I highly suggest you
accept my generosity.

21
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:14,291
[SEBAS]
My apologies. In that case,

22
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,875
I would ask for clothes

23
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:18,583
and other daily
necessities for Tuare.

24
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:22,583
[AINS] Granted. I shall
provide the necessary gold.

25
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:26,291
Perhaps she can accompany you
on a bit of a shopping date.

26
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:27,833
[SEBAS]
You jest, my lord.

27
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:29,125
[AINS]
Not at all.

28
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,500
Then you have my gratitude.

29
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:34,375
[AINS] Now, Solution,
tell me what you desire

30
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:36,291
so that I may grant it.

31
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:37,458
I would like to request

32
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,625
a small selection
of humans, Lord.

33
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:42,583
If possible, I would
prefer them to be alive.

34
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:45,208
And if those humans
were innocent as well,

35
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,875
that would give me
the utmost pleasure.

36
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:51,000
[AINS]
Living humans, you say? Granted.

37
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,583
However, I will not
allow innocent ones.

38
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,166
Forgive me, but I fear
I cannot grant your wish

39
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,875
exactly to your specifications.

40
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,125
[SOLUTION]
It's more than enough, my lord!

41
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,958
[AINS]
Next. Entoma.

42
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,291
[ENTOMA]
Lord.

43
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,000
[AINS] It seems that your
voice has yet to return.

44
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:11,000
[ENTOMA] Do you find
me repulsive, my lord?

45
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,541
[AINS]
Certainly not.

46
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,541
Your efforts are all
that matter to me,

47
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:17,083
and they have earned
you a reward.

48
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,500
[ENTOMA]
In that case, Lord Ains.

49
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,750
I would have the voice
of the woman who stole mine.

50
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,166
Should the need to
kill her ever arise,

51
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,708
I ask that you give me
the order to do it.

52
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,833
[AINS]
Ah, the girl with the mask.

53
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:33,500
She remains a mystery
to me. But very well.

54
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:36,333
I will call for you
if such a time arises.

55
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,000
[ENTOMA] You have my
gratitude, Lord Ains.

56
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,375
From the depths of my heart.

57
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,291
[AINS]
Mm.

58
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,125
[AINS]
Ah.

59
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,833
Mm. That's the stuff!

60
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,916
[AINS]
I had to get a bit creative,

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,333
but I finally found a way
to clean these bones of mine.

62
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:40,125
[AINS] Who knew a slime bath
would be so refreshing?

63
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,500
It didn't sound very
appealing at first,

64
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,875
but I wish I'd tried
this ages ago.

65
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,250
I can feel my gooey friend
slithering its way

66
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,250
into every nook and cranny.

67
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,291
[AINS sighs]

68
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,583
[MOMONGA] This might be
the most Japanese thing

69
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,041
I've done since I
came to this world.

70
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,375
Hot baths are a
national pastime!

71
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,375
I may be all bones,
but a love for bathing

72
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,250
is in my blood for sure!

73
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,791
Well, not that I had
the time or money to enjoy

74
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,166
anything this fancy back home.

75
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,541
[MOMONGA] I wonder if I
embarrassed Sebas back there.

76
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,333
Tuare does dote on him, though.

77
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,416
Demiurge said they seem close.

78
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,416
If they go on that
date in E-Rantel,

79
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,791
maybe I'll wear a
disguise and tail them.

80
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,500
Just kidding.

81
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,375
[AINS]
Still, as their supervisor,

82
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,500
it's my job to ensure
that my employees--

83
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,541
or subordinates--
enjoy their time off!

84
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,000
[ECLAIR]
Do not leave a single speck

85
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,791
of dust behind, understand?

86
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,291
--[MANSERVANTS] Yee!
--[MAIDS] Yes.

87
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,666
[ECLAIR] Heh! For, surely,
this Great Tomb of Nazarick

88
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,541
shall be mine to command soon!

89
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,000
[MANSERVANTS]
Yee!

90
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,458
[ECLAIR]
Mm-hm!

91
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,166
[ECLAIR] Why, I didn't
notice you standing there!

92
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,000
Lovely weather we're having.
A fine morning!

93
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,375
[ECLAIR]
Hm?

94
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,833
[FOIRE]
Looks like you're in top form

95
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,583
this morning, Cixous!

96
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,708
That's because I'm taking
care of Lord Ains today.

97
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:16,125
[LUPISREGINA] Oh! So you need
the extra calories, huh?

98
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,958
Whoa. Miss Lupisregina!

99
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,833
You just had to sneak up
on us, didn't you?

100
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,458
Goodness, you nearly
made my heart

101
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,708
leap out of my chest!

102
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,750
[giggles] Can you blame me?

103
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,250
That look on all your
faces was priceless!

104
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,041
I'll have to try this
back in the village.

105
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,458
[FOIRE]
What village?

106
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,000
These days, I've been working
at a human settlement

107
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,666
called Carne Village.

108
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,958
[LUMIERE] Humans, huh?
That must be taxing.

109
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:42,958
More like a total bore!
I was hoping for a gig

110
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,833
with a little more
excitement, you know?

111
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:48,125
[ECLAIR] Unhand me!
Unhand me this instant!

112
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,583
I have highly important
cleaning to do!

113
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,041
--[MAIDS shriek]
--[MAID 1D] It's CZ!

114
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,875
[MAID 1E]
Hey, CZ!

115
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,625
[CZ]
So there you are.

116
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,416
[ECLAIR] My insides! They're
about to become outsides!

117
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:10,000
[CZ] I wish you would stop
misusing Complete Invisibility.

118
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,666
I know, sorry!

119
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,083
[CZ] On top of that,
you started without me.

120
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,375
You said we'd have
breakfast together.

121
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,083
[LUPISREGINA]
Shoot, I forgot!

122
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,500
That sure did surprise me!

123
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,750
I'm just happy we got
to see Miss Lupisregina.

124
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,708
[MAIDS chuckle]

125
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:29,583
[gasps]

126
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,041
[CIXOUS]
Gotta refocus.

127
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,541
I'm taking care of
Lord Ains today!

128
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,125
Okay! It's time to go!

129
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,375
[CIXOUS]
Good morning to you, Lord Ains.

130
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,875
[AINS]
Mm.

131
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,458
[AINS] Ah, always here
well ahead of schedule.

132
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:55,250
You are permitted to enjoy your
breakfast at the very least.

133
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,875
To be frank,
serving you is my joy,

134
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,875
and the greatest
honor in my life.

135
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,541
That goes for the
rest of the maids

136
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,666
and the eight-edge
assassins, as well.

137
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,708
[CIXOUS] We only come
early because, with you,

138
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,875
we treasure every moment.

139
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,208
[AINS] It was not my
intent to reprimand you.

140
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,416
But did you rest well yesterday?

141
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,416
I did!

142
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,708
In order to serve
the Supreme One

143
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,541
with every fiber of my being,

144
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:20,125
I ensured that I rested
most thoroughly.

145
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,458
[AINS]
I see.

146
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,125
[MOMONGA] It's like we're
running a sweatshop here.

147
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,208
[knocking]

148
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,833
[MOMONGA]
If I don't order them to rest,

149
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,458
they'll work
themselves to death!

150
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,541
Loyalty is nice,
but there's a limit!

151
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,708
And they're alive, so I
can't just reprogram them

152
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,333
like when they were NPCs.

153
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,500
[CIXOUS]
Lord Ains.

154
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,833
Lord Demiurge is here
to meet with you.

155
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,083
[AINS] If you're looking
for Albedo, she's off.

156
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,333
My lord. She's "off"?

157
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,416
[AINS] I requested that she
spend the day in leisure

158
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,458
with the other female
floor guardians.

159
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,000
And this

160
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:03,041
is something I put together
for the male floor guardians.

161
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,958
I had hoped to include Sebas,

162
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,041
but he's occupied
with Tuare today.

163
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,166
I'll invite him next time.

164
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,916
What is it?

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,916
[AINS]
An information circular.

166
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,375
Come to me, my cavalry beast!

167
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,041
Whoa!

168
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,500
That's way more fancy
than a regular bicorn!

169
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,666
Look his horns. And his
muscles are so taut!

170
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,166
Indeed so!

171
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,125
He's truly worthy of the
title "War Bicorn Lord."

172
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,041
Although, technically,
any level 100 Bicorn

173
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,750
would look like this.

174
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,083
[AURA] I see. So what
do you call him, then?

175
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,958
A bicorn. I just said.

176
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,458
I don't mean its
species! Its name!

177
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:47,833
[ALBEDO]
Does he need one?

178
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,875
That's up to you
since he's your pet.

179
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,958
He's more of a weapon
than a pet, actually.

180
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,000
Also, I'm not quite certain
that I'm summoning

181
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,458
the same bicorn each time.

182
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,083
Well, you could
always ask Kyouhukou,

183
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,208
since he's so good
at summoning things.

184
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,416
I don't know if that expertise
applies to anything

185
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,041
other than cockroaches, though.

186
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,250
[ALBEDO]
Kyouhukou?

187
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,333
I know he's loyal to
Nazarick, so I feel bad

188
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,083
for disliking him,
but his appearance

189
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,958
is rather distressing.

190
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,666
Yeah. No kidding.

191
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,583
His family can never behave!

192
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,291
They skitter up in your clothes
and it's just the worst!

I can feel their
little legs now!

[SHALLTEAR]
That's enough!

You're making me positively
itchy! How vile!

196
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,500
I'm relieved to see that
everyone is on the same page.

Back to the bicorn.

198
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,083
Are you gonna name him or not?

199
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,541
[ALBEDO] If I did, I would want
it to have a dignified name.

200
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,250
Something that
embodies my passion

201
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,291
and dedication for Lord Ains!

202
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,958
How about "Top of the World?"

203
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,541
[SHALLTEAR sighs]
Lord Ains certainly is

204
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:45,250
the top of the world, but is it
appropriate to ride on him?

[AURA] Get off for now.

Even taking my armor and

An encyclopedia
by Lord Peroroncino!

This was a gift from
Lord Ains, by the way!

She shouldn't brag.

Lord Ains gave me this
wristband as a gift.

230

Just like my ring.

I wish I could receive

According to this entry, bicorns
are a symbol of impurity.

In terms of who is
capable of riding them,

240
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,583
they are the
opposite of unicorns.

While unicorns can only
be ridden by pure maidens,

bicorns can only be
ridden by impure ones.

Who am I supposed
to have sex with?

I'm ashamed to admit
it, but Lord Ains

hasn't summoned me
to his bed even once.

314
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,083
Breeding between humans
and non-human species

315
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,750
is impossible, so they say!

316
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,833
A tragic limitation
this world has.

317
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:36,333
Even with the beauty of true
love binding two species,

318
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,791
their union cannot bear fruit.

319
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,250
My master is diligently
striving to rectify

320
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,500
this mistake of nature.

321
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,583
To give two poor
lovers a chance

322
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,416
to conceive a child!

323
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,041
Sorry. Those were more
details than you asked for.

324
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,750
And since you've received
the information circular,

325
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,208
I best be on my way.

326
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,916
To create such happiness
is a demanding job.

327
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Okay. Well, thanks and
good luck with work!

328

Whoa. Okay!

335
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,916
I better deliver this
to Cocytus right away!

Yeah.

337

I demand silence!

[AINS]
Silence. Hm.

339
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,625
Is this a good pose?

340
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:48,125
Might look cooler if I bent
my forearm inwards some.

341
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,250
[AINS]
Such infernal discord!

342
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,625
I demand silence!

343
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,833
[AINS] All right, I can scratch
that pose off the list.

344
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,958
Guess I should practice the
lines I use to buy time.

345
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,708
[MOMONGA sighs]
I'm just a normal

nine-to-five office drone.

347
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,833
How am I supposed to pull off

348
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:10,958
this supreme overlord routine
day in and day out?

[MOMONGA sighs]

350
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,083
[MOMONGA]
What do I do?

351
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,166
I need to present myself
with the admirable air

352
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,375
worthy of a Nazarick overlord.

353
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,291
But I gotta do it without
destroying the image

354
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,833
everybody has of Ains Ooal Gown.

355
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,958
Ah. I need a nap.

356
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,708
Get up, you sloth! Keep working!

[CIXOUS]
Lord Ains? It's time.

359
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,625
[AINS] Well, I suppose
that settles that.

360
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,333
[AINS] Guess I'll put
my practice to the test!

361
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,291
[MOMONGA]
Hell, yes!

362
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,708
Now that is how
a ruler takes a seat!

363
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,166
I mean, not that I know
how a ruler would sit,

364
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,500
but it felt right.

365
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,416
[AINS]
Now, then. Mare.

366
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,958
What've you brought me?

00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,333
Uh, right!

368
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:18,208
I, um, well, it's a...
valuable document!

369

[AINS]
Why are you staring?

370
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,833
Is there something interesting
I'm unaware of on my face?

371
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,791
Wha-- Not at all, my lord!

372
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:32,125
Honestly, I was just admiring
how cool you are, Lord Ains.

373
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,333
[AINS]
I am? [laughs]

374
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,125
Well aren't you
adept at flattery!

375
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,291
I'm not trying to flatter you!

376
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,250
Uh. I...

377
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:42,041
I'm sorry, Lord Ains, excuse me.

378
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,083
It's just that...

379
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,375
I genuinely do
think you're cool!

380
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,791
I mean, right now,

381
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,125
that way you sat down,
your movement was so graceful

382
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,166
and yet so commanding!

383
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:57,458
[AINS]
I see. Thank you, Mare.

384
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,958
I'm truly happy to hear that.

385
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,416
Your words always
seem to have a way

386
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,583
of filling me with joy.

387
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,500
[AINS] And not only that,
but it fills me with gratitude

388
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,208
for my comrades.

389
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,833
Your comrades? Y'mean
the other supreme beings?

390
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,333
[AINS]
That's right.

391
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,875
I'm thankful that we created

392
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:19,083
the Great Tomb of Nazarick
together, and equally grateful

393
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,833
they carried onward
with their endeavor

394
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,041
until they created all of you.

395
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,958
And, of course, that includes
the two of you as well,

396
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,000
Albedo and Cixous.

397
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,250
You actually know my lowly name?

398
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,000
[AINS] I consider you all
to be my treasures.

399

[AINS]
I wouldn't even give you up

to Bukubuku Chagama herself.

[CIXOUS]
Lord Ains. I can't stay silent.

403
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,791
And know I speak
for all of Nazarick

404
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,291
when I say this.

405
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,875
But of all the creators
who lived in this world,

406
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,958
we're so thankful you're
the one who stayed behind.

[CIXOUS gasps, grunts]

408
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,208
Forgive my tone.

409
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,250
I don't mean to
offend our creators,

410
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,416
nor do I mean to
speak so freely.

411
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,041
But. Please accept
our continued fealty!

Please, my lord!

I shall.

Oh, Lord Ains!

I've tried so hard, but I
can't hold back any longer!

You are to blame, my lord!

Get off me, Albedo! Hey, stop!

quit gyrating like that!

expect from the overseer

we could use some help!

Hey, Lord Mare!

Uh, sure.

[ALBEDO] Give me but
a drop of your mercy!

--Lord Ains! Lord Ains!
--[AINS] Will you calm down?!

[AINS] So you even look
like that when you bathe?

443
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,041
Well, being naked is his
normal state of being.

444

[COCYTUS]
Come now.

445
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,250
I'd appreciate it if you
didn't make me sound like

00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,458
some sort of pervert.

447

[AINS]
Forgive me, Cocytus.

448
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,333
Your exoskeleton is very regal.

You honor me, my lord.

450

[AINS]
Thank you, Mare.

451
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,833
I'll wash your back
next, if you'd like.

452
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:18,125
No! That's far too kind!

[AURA] Quite a mane you've
got down there, Albedo.

[ALBEDO]
You know, Aura,

455
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,708
you don't have to be
so crass about it.

456
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,375
[AURA laughs]

457
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,458
[ALBEDO]
Lord Ains is bathing

00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,583
just on the other
side of this wall.

459
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,666
I wonder if there's
a peephole around here?

460
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,291
[AURA]
Don't the guys do the peeping?

461
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,791
[SHALLTEAR] That doesn't
exactly apply to our situation.

462
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,833
After all, if Lord Ains
wants to see us nude,

463
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,666
he need only command
us to strip.

464
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,875
[AINS]
Uh...

465
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,333
[DEMIURGE]
My deepest apologies, Lord Ains!

466
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,250
The overseer of the guardians...

467
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,333
How dare she speak
in such a manner.

468
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:47,416
I'll tell her to stop at once!

469
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,916
[AINS]
No! Well. I mean.

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Albedo already
has enough stress.

471
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,291
This is her time to
cut loose and relax.

472
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:54,500
[DEMIURGE]
Of course, understood.

473
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,208
[rumbling]

474
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,000
[AURA]
Whoa, hey, what're you doing?

475
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,541
You can't just jump in
without rinsing off!

476
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:06,125
[AURA] What the...?
Is that stone lion moving?

477
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:08,500
[LUCIFER] Those who lack
bathing manners have no right

478
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,166
to enter the baths!

479
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,333
[LADIES scream]

480
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:12,750
[LUCIFER]
Suffer your divine punishment!

481
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,416
[COCYTUS]
A guardian of the baths?

482
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,541
I had no idea such
a creature existed.

483
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:19,791
[AINS] They don't.
That's Lucifer's voice!

484
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:21,291
It's his doing!

485
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,208
[DEMIURGE]
The supreme being?

486
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,791
[SHALLTEAR]
I can't even crack it!

487
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:27,166
This is no normal golem! Albedo!

488
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,750
[ALBEDO] Get out of here,
you golem-craft, pervert scum!

489
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,208
[AINS]
Don your armor and weapons.

490
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,375
We shall enter the women's bath!

491
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,541
I assume this is one
of Lucifer's pranks,

492
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,000
but we must rush to
their aid all the same!

493
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,250
[GROUP]
Lord!

494
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:45,416
[MOMONGA] So much for
our day off, I guess.

495
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
[ALBEDO]
Perish!

496
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:53,250
[AINS] The floor guardians
and servants gather

497
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,583
in the throne room

498
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,541
so that Demiurge and
Albedo can announce

499
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,708
the future plans of Nazarick.

500
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:01,875
I've no doubt such a capable
pair will convey our goals

501
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,666
with style and grace.

502
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,458
As a great ruler, my only
duty is to nod benevolently.

503
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:09,166
Hm? Hold on.

504
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,166
How did they come
to that conclusion?!

505
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,416
Chapter 2: "Carne
Village Once More."

506
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,541
Yes, it will be fine.

507
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:19,250
Everything will
proceed as planned.
