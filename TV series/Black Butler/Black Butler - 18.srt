1
00:00:15,608 --> 00:00:18,608
Ciel... Ciel...

2
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:22,233
Ciel Phantomhive:

3
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:33,358
Look. This is your past.

4
00:00:33,442 --> 00:00:36,692
Some of it shines brightly...
and some of it...

5
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:39,483
remains shrouded
in darkness.

6
00:00:43,108 --> 00:00:47,025
Ah... so that is
the past you choose?

7
00:00:55,817 --> 00:00:57,400
No, Father!

8
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:04,025
I know you!

9
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,983
Master?

10
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:06,233
This is
the Grim Reaper Library.

11
00:03:06,317 --> 00:03:08,067
I don't know if you're aware,
but this is where

12
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,233
the Cinematic Records
are housed.

13
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:38,817
Ah, as I suspected, it is you.
I thought I smelled a rat.

14
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,358
Will!

15
00:03:40,442 --> 00:03:43,067
To think a demon would have
the nerve to set foot in here.

16
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,233
No, hold on Will...!
I'm looking for

17
00:03:45,317 --> 00:03:47,233
the Doomsday Books
like you ordered.

18
00:03:47,317 --> 00:03:50,317
What a shame,
a Grim Reaper and you

19
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,192
invited this filth into our
territory. You're a disgrace...

20
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:58,567
Are you actually trying to
be demoted even further?

21
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,733
What.... What will
you do to me now?

22
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:05,608
You call me
an invading rat...

23
00:04:05,692 --> 00:04:07,900
but I do believe that you
have another infestation

24
00:04:07,983 --> 00:04:09,733
to be worrying about.

25
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,150
The angel.

26
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:14,650
That's right.

27
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:19,233
Excellent... looks like I'll
have more overtime tonight.

28
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:40,942
So, you're awake now,
are you?

29
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:47,733
Really? It was you...
Angela Blanc?

30
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:50,692
How did you enjoy the
record of your past...?

31
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:53,525
Did it feel like being
wrapped in soft velvet...

32
00:04:53,608 --> 00:04:55,900
or perhaps...
sandpaper against your skin?

33
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:57,275
Shut up!

34
00:04:57,358 --> 00:04:58,983
The hand I saw...

35
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,983
That hand was his...
my father's hand.

36
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:11,608
You killed them,
didn't you? But why...?

37
00:05:11,692 --> 00:05:15,483
Why did you kill my parents?!
What did you stand to gain--?

38
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:18,525
"Killed?" What a
disturbing thing to say.

39
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:20,942
I'm not the only one
who harmed your parents...

40
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:25,025
But you know that...
don't you?

41
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:30,983
It was your butler...
No, It was you, wasn't it...?

42
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:33,567
It was you who gave them
their second death.

43
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:46,775
You were rather brilliant.
In the face of such

44
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:51,150
a distorted past you somehow
managed to remain sane.

45
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:53,150
How could you?

46
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:55,900
You are a truly
unclean human.

47
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,858
But... underneath all
of those impurities,

48
00:06:01,942 --> 00:06:05,817
there is a glow it would be
such a shame to extinguish.

49
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,400
Well, Ciel...

50
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:11,317
Shall I alter your unsightly,
impure past for you...?

51
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,858
Would that help you
find peace at last?

52
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,108
An angel she would
indeed have the ability

53
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:21,150
to tamper with a
Cinematic Record.

54
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,067
You mean they can
change the past?

55
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,983
I don't think even a deity
could manage that...

56
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:30,233
but still, an angel can give
a false sense of peace.

57
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:33,733
Nice try...! But you're
the reason I'm impure!

58
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:40,025
Someone who has experienced
trauma great enough

59
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,858
to break his soul may
wish for all memory of it

60
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:45,900
to be obliterated. However...

61
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:50,025
it will haunt him forever...
no matter what.

62
00:07:00,275 --> 00:07:03,192
Ciel... it's all right.

63
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:17,858
You don't need
to mourn us anymore...

64
00:07:17,942 --> 00:07:19,775
You can abandon your grief.

65
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:23,067
That's right... Ciel...
We hate to see you

66
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,483
suffering needlessly like this.

67
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:30,775
An angel's powers
leave the past unchanged...

68
00:07:30,858 --> 00:07:33,775
They simply manipulate
a person's impression of it,

69
00:07:33,858 --> 00:07:37,483
offering a rosier view
of things than before.

70
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:42,400
You're lying... Liar...! My
mother and father were killed--

71
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:47,192
We were... but in that moment
we saw a bright light.

72
00:07:47,275 --> 00:07:50,983
It was a tranquil peaceful
glow wrapped in love...

73
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:53,400
In death your father
and I were finally able

74
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:56,275
to become one
in body and spirit.

75
00:07:56,358 --> 00:08:01,483
Yes... that's right... and now
that we are truly joined...

76
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:05,567
now... we can embrace
your body and spirit as well

77
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,358
and join you to us
completely, son.

78
00:08:11,817 --> 00:08:13,192
Come, Ciel.

79
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:14,483
Our son.

80
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:17,025
We love you so much.

81
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:21,525
I love you too...
Mother, Father...

82
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:30,650
Master!

83
00:08:35,358 --> 00:08:39,317
His past is being rewritten,
being cleansed.

84
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,608
Soon, he will be as pure
as the driven snow.

85
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:43,900
Cleansed?

86
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:47,525
Hatred is painful...
No one wants to harbor it

87
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:50,983
in their hearts.
Ciel is no different.

88
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:51,733
Master!

89
00:08:51,817 --> 00:08:53,233
Don't be hasty.

90
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:56,108
You can't stop her right now...

91
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:59,067
If you do, the child's past
will be horribly changed...

92
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,483
and as a result, he'll become
something less than human.

93
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,067
Yes, pure as
the driven snow.

94
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:11,525
My young master...
being purified?

95
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:23,608
That's right,
Ciel... Keep going...

96
00:09:23,692 --> 00:09:26,733
We don't bear any grudge
toward anybody.

97
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:30,900
Yes... come closer, Ciel.

98
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:35,442
Don't be led astray by
things like hatred and pain.

99
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:38,275
Free yourself from
all such emotions.

100
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:40,775
Unnecessary... unclean.

101
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,233
What is it, Ciel?

102
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:48,192
What's wrong?

103
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:52,067
N- No... no.

104
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,150
What, Ciel?

105
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:55,692
No, I... don't want....

106
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:58,400
What are you saying...?
Please, Ciel!

107
00:09:58,483 --> 00:10:04,067
Maybe you never bore
a grudge, but still...

108
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:08,775
that has nothing to do
with me. Nothing.

109
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,983
It cannot change my hatred!

110
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:14,108
But Ciel... How could
you say that?

111
00:10:14,192 --> 00:10:16,192
Please think about what
you're really saying!

112
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:18,775
I thought you loved us, dear!

113
00:10:18,858 --> 00:10:21,275
I do love you... I always will.

114
00:10:21,358 --> 00:10:23,733
And that's why it hurt
to lose you...

115
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,608
It hurt so much!

116
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:31,817
After that...
hatred was all I had left.

117
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,358
Why don't you just let it go?

118
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:33,858
I can't!

119
00:10:33,942 --> 00:10:35,692
Why, Ciel...

120
00:10:35,775 --> 00:10:39,317
If I let go of hatred...
then the person I've been

121
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,317
since that day
disappears with it.

122
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,817
That's not me...!
It's not me!

123
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,275
But darling....

124
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:05,858
Please, Ciel...

125
00:11:05,942 --> 00:11:09,525
I won't... let go.

126
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:17,858
I will not let it go.
I will not lose... my hatred!

127
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:29,442
What...?! He's rewinding
the Cinematic Record

128
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:31,525
all on his own?!

129
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,942
Master!

130
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,192
What the hell
were you thinking?

131
00:11:41,942 --> 00:11:45,108
Sebastian... good catch.

132
00:11:45,192 --> 00:11:47,942
Always surprising. You
are forever exceeding

133
00:11:48,025 --> 00:11:52,442
my expectations.
You have a worthy soul.

134
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:55,192
Indeed, truly worthy, master.

135
00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:01,733
Such a horribly
unclean heart... Depraved...

136
00:12:01,817 --> 00:12:04,025
stagnant...
trapped in the dark.

137
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:06,942
I should never
have shown you pity.

138
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:10,650
So here and now...
I shall purify you.

139
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:13,150
We'll see about that.

140
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,525
A crime in the library
is our jurisdiction...

141
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:20,108
Let us join the fight...
now come with me Grelle.

142
00:12:20,192 --> 00:12:21,775
Oh, my!

143
00:12:24,317 --> 00:12:28,358
We will march into
battle together, then:

144
00:12:28,442 --> 00:12:29,692
a, passionate,
fighting trinity!

145
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:32,942
Pardon me. Please move
aside. I'm coming through.

146
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:39,150
Let's see here... Number
eight... number eight....

147
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:40,733
Undertaker?

148
00:12:40,817 --> 00:12:42,317
Hi!

149
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,442
Hey you...
what are you doing he--?!

150
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:48,775
Mind your manners, idiot...!
He's a legend.

151
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:51,483
He passed judgment
on Robin Hood and sent

152
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:53,983
Marie Antoinette to hell

153
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:56,442
The Grim Reaper who makes
even crying children

154
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,817
willingly give up their souls.

155
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,483
No, not fair!

156
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:02,192
He doesn't look
anything like the chap

157
00:13:02,275 --> 00:13:04,150
in the sequence just now!

158
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:06,275
How could this
creepy old man be

159
00:13:06,358 --> 00:13:08,233
a legendary
Grim Reaper...

160
00:13:09,608 --> 00:13:10,817
Take me!

161
00:13:14,608 --> 00:13:16,192
You seem busy...

162
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:18,858
I suppose I'll have to
start my purification

163
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:20,275
in the abbey, then.

164
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:22,108
Running away, coward!

165
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:24,233
You shall see...
I'll show you all

166
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:27,317
what happens to a world
ruled by impurity...

167
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,275
I doubt you'll like it, though.

168
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:36,983
What... was that?

169
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,942
An angelic seal.

170
00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:02,400
What are we supposed
to do now...?

171
00:14:02,483 --> 00:14:04,900
Our leader is gone!

172
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:07,983
You don't have to grieve.

173
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:11,025
The time has come
to use the coffins...

174
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:13,650
The moment is at hand at last.

175
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:18,358
A... An angel?!

176
00:14:21,108 --> 00:14:23,192
Give up everything to me.

177
00:14:23,275 --> 00:14:26,733
Including... Your sullied
Doomsday Books...

178
00:14:26,817 --> 00:14:29,983
They have no future
to offer you...

179
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:32,108
There is nothing left.

180
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,108
It won't open!

181
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:39,358
Oh, dear.
Unfortunately, it looks as if

182
00:14:39,442 --> 00:14:40,942
we're locked in.

183
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:53,608
What is this...? It looks
like the Cinematic Record

184
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:56,025
of someone who
is in that abbey.

185
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:58,358
Seriously?

186
00:14:58,442 --> 00:14:59,567
Interesting...

187
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,358
"An angel of massacre
is descending...

188
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:04,900
in an abbey that
is near Preston."

189
00:15:04,983 --> 00:15:07,983
What? An angel
of massacre?

190
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:12,525
All you who have gathered
here. Your souls are impure.

191
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:16,400
they are dependent,
leaning on others.

192
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,775
You have forgotten
how to take the future

193
00:15:18,858 --> 00:15:20,733
into your own hands.

194
00:15:22,483 --> 00:15:26,858
The unclean... end them...
The unwanted... end them...

195
00:15:26,942 --> 00:15:29,775
The unnecessary... end them.

196
00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:33,358
Ah, yes... I see it now.

197
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:34,775
Stop her now.

198
00:15:34,858 --> 00:15:39,358
Ooh master... how charitable...
I thought your intent

199
00:15:39,442 --> 00:15:42,108
was to put an end to this
cult once and for all.

200
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:45,233
I don't want to help them,
but I don't want her

201
00:15:45,317 --> 00:15:47,608
to have her way... That is all.

202
00:15:49,358 --> 00:15:51,108
But what are we
supposed to do...?

203
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:54,067
We can't even
find a way in there.

204
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,525
No... not true.

205
00:15:56,608 --> 00:15:59,983
There is a way... We have
a tool... the ultimate

206
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:03,650
Reaper tool to which we
managers have access.

207
00:16:04,608 --> 00:16:08,567
This tool... is the
Death Bookmark.

208
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,942
A bookmark?

209
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:14,858
And it's pink.
Isn't that lovely?

210
00:16:27,358 --> 00:16:29,775
If we use this
to halt the story,

211
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:32,358
we can make some
editorial changes.

212
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:35,983
The woman in this story happens
to be Matilda Simmons...

213
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:38,483
It says here that she is
purified in the abbey

214
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:40,858
by the angel Angela.

215
00:16:40,942 --> 00:16:43,025
But the sentence
just ends there.

216
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:47,067
Oh, yes... but now
I just add that

217
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,233
Sebastian Michaelis
appears suddenly...

218
00:16:50,317 --> 00:16:52,733
Oh no...! Bassy!

219
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:03,942
That woman there...
she smells like a demon.

220
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:06,400
Yes

221
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:10,025
You see... I've
already marked her.

222
00:17:10,108 --> 00:17:11,400
It's you!

223
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:14,608
You wish to die at the hands
of an angel, do you...?

224
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:18,942
A pious demon indeed.
Sebastian Michaelis.

225
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:28,275
You think a demon can
compare with the purity

226
00:17:28,358 --> 00:17:30,692
of a winged angel in flight?

227
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:36,483
A creature like you... is
chained to the earth, forever.

228
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:39,942
Really? ...is that so...?

229
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,400
then I suppose that
you are forever chained

230
00:17:42,483 --> 00:17:43,733
to the heavens.

231
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,483
Let's get to work!

232
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:53,400
A brand-new
Death Scythe!

233
00:18:00,275 --> 00:18:01,483
Well done!

234
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:04,067
You shall wash and
return it when this is over.

235
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,275
Uh... so cruel.

236
00:18:06,358 --> 00:18:09,650
But suddenly, there's a
dramatic turn of events...

237
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:12,567
Grim Reapers William T.
Spears and Grell Sutcliff

238
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,942
appear before Matilda
in the abbey.

239
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:16,692
That's a useful tool.

240
00:18:16,775 --> 00:18:19,733
Indeed, but even it
has some limits.

241
00:18:19,817 --> 00:18:21,733
This looks like
it could be fun.

242
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:23,067
Do you know what...?

243
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,983
I think we should have
ourselves a game of darts.

244
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:32,067
Oh dear... I missed...
Now... whatever do you think

245
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,775
I should aim for next?

246
00:18:33,858 --> 00:18:35,733
Pick me, I want to play!

247
00:18:35,817 --> 00:18:37,233
A demon, all right.

248
00:18:58,692 --> 00:19:02,108
What's this...? Does she
mean to die along side us?

249
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:06,150
Snuff out the unclean...
Snuff out the unnecessary.

250
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:08,650
Uh, boys... see the ceiling?!

251
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:10,192
You're all free to go now...

252
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:12,650
It might be
the best option for you.

253
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:14,567
Yes... yes, okay!

254
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:23,317
It is our turn now... We will
retreat, Grell Sutcliff.

255
00:19:24,317 --> 00:19:26,983
Seriously! Never mind
the overtime!

256
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:28,692
I want a day off!

257
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:03,400
Is it over?

258
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:07,733
She plunged me into
a bottomless abyss...

259
00:20:07,817 --> 00:20:10,525
And I don't even know why.

260
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,817
A promise...
is a promise!

261
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:49,567
Why, Sebastian?! Why are you
not taking my soul?!

262
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,692
She has to be dead!
Doesn't she?!

263
00:20:55,442 --> 00:20:58,900
Someone else...? Is there?

264
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:05,983
I'm sorry. I'll be serving you
a while longer, Master.

265
00:21:13,275 --> 00:21:15,817
Out of curiosity, why were
you in the library?

266
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,400
I was under the impression
that you'd retired

267
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:18,775
from active service.

268
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:23,483
Well... This fellow here
reminded me of something.

269
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:25,567
There were some Cinematic
Records I'd neglected

270
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,317
to return.

271
00:21:28,817 --> 00:21:30,358
You must be kidding.

272
00:21:30,442 --> 00:21:32,817
Certainly not. In fact,
now that you mention it,

273
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,650
two of the books I
checked out were about

274
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:38,067
an Earl Phantomhive
and his lady wife.

275
00:21:39,108 --> 00:21:41,650
Their true Cinematic
Records: ones that had never

276
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,358
been touched by
avenging angels...

277
00:21:44,442 --> 00:21:47,525
Would you like to know
what they said, my lord?

278
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:54,858
No... Now...
Let's go... Sebastian.

279
00:21:54,942 --> 00:21:56,108
Yes, sir.

280
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:03,733
That was interesting.

281
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:06,942
Are you sure
that was wise?

282
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,358
I'm sorry, master... but
if you read the books,

283
00:22:09,442 --> 00:22:11,858
you'd know who
deserved your revenge.

284
00:22:11,942 --> 00:22:13,108
It's done.

285
00:22:13,192 --> 00:22:14,442
Feeling sentimental?

286
00:22:14,525 --> 00:22:17,150
Not that...It's just...

287
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:23,108
Seeing them again... being
near them once more...

288
00:22:25,192 --> 00:22:28,650
You can only disgrace
the dead so much...

289
00:24:10,858 --> 00:24:13,775
Master, lately you seem
to have made quite a friend

290
00:24:13,858 --> 00:24:16,233
of inspector Abberline.

291
00:24:16,317 --> 00:24:18,900
Making new friends
is lotable, naturally

292
00:24:18,983 --> 00:24:22,108
but one might air on
the side of caution.

293
00:24:22,192 --> 00:24:23,442
I would advise you
not to become

294
00:24:23,525 --> 00:24:25,358
so deeply involved
that you put yourself

295
00:24:25,442 --> 00:24:26,525
at risk.

296
00:24:26,608 --> 00:24:28,733
Share a short conversation
now and then

297
00:24:28,817 --> 00:24:31,650
but always be
on the lookout.

298
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:33,650
Next time, on Black Butler...

299
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:35,525
"His Butler, Imprisioned."

300
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:38,233
You see, I am simply
one hell of a butler.
