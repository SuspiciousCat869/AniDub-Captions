1
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:22,358
He's gone...
Bloody hell!

2
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:28,400
Where's Lord Barrymore?

3
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:42,358
The... the Demon Hound....
The great hound is here!

4
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,858
No! The hound?

5
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:54,233
The white dog is a good dog,
a good dog, good .

6
00:00:54,317 --> 00:00:58,483
The black dog is a bad dog,
a bad dog, bad...

7
00:00:58,567 --> 00:01:00,150
He'll eat your flesh
down to the bone.

8
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:02,067
Down to the bone...

9
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,942
He'll gobble you up
until you're gone,

10
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:05,650
until your gone...

11
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:06,900
What's happening?

12
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:10,192
Lullaby, the sun sets...
Lullaby, good night...

13
00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:13,192
The white dog is a good dog--

14
00:01:13,275 --> 00:01:15,483
Snap out of it...!
What are you all doing?

15
00:01:18,317 --> 00:01:22,192
The white dog is a good dog,
a good dog, good .

16
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:37,942
Oh, Great Demon Hound!

17
00:01:38,025 --> 00:01:40,108
Please, Please...
Oh Please!

18
00:01:40,192 --> 00:01:42,692
Demon Hound, please...
forgive us!

19
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,233
Angela!

20
00:03:30,358 --> 00:03:32,692
Well, this is
unfortunate, master.

21
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:35,275
To think... all this
happening after the case

22
00:03:35,358 --> 00:03:39,525
was closed... I'm sure you
are a bit... annoyed?

23
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:41,150
Are you quite finished?

24
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:44,067
Where is Angela?

25
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,275
We left her resting up
in her bed for now...

26
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:48,733
She seems tired,
yes she does.

27
00:03:48,817 --> 00:03:51,567
It's too pitiful to watch,
the poor bird.

28
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,400
This village isolated
itself completely

29
00:03:55,483 --> 00:03:57,400
from the rest of society
out of fear

30
00:03:57,483 --> 00:04:00,192
of the Demon
Hound's curse.

31
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:02,275
I thought for certain the
hound was an illusion

32
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:03,983
created by
Lord Barrymore

33
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:06,400
so he could more firmly rule
the village...

34
00:04:06,483 --> 00:04:11,108
But with him dead...I need
to rethink things.

35
00:04:11,192 --> 00:04:13,817
He was covered in bite
wounds... Maybe the villagers

36
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,317
are right... Maybe it really
was the Demon Hound,

37
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,192
Maybe he's upset
at bein' blamed

38
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:21,317
for Lord Henry's misdeeds.

39
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,442
Yes, maybe... For now there's
only one thing we know...

40
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:26,983
It wasn't human.

41
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,775
The hound, then.

42
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:38,567
Is something the matter?

43
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,983
It's about what you said
earlier, how you phrased it.

44
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:43,775
What you said was, "This
wasn't human work."...

45
00:04:43,858 --> 00:04:46,150
What if... that bloody
reaper has gotten himself

46
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:47,317
involved in this.

47
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,942
A deadly efficient butler!

48
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,192
It seems you're learning
faster every day...

49
00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:55,983
I'm so very proud
of you, sir.

50
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,900
But there is
no need to worry.

51
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:04,900
I believe Mei-Rin's thought
was not wholly incorrect...

52
00:05:04,983 --> 00:05:07,275
The Hound was after
Lord Henry...

53
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:08,525
I don't believe
anyone else

54
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,942
is in danger of becoming
its victim.

55
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:15,900
That's not enough information
for me to close the case.

56
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,317
Ah, such loyalty to
your queen...

57
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,483
Quite touching, really.

58
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:22,567
That's not it...
at least not all of it...

59
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,775
You're usually
so calm and steady...

60
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,942
But this case seems
to have you rattled...

61
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:30,858
I'm interested about this
issue you have with dogs.

62
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:36,150
As I said, you learn
faster every day.

63
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:45,525
Poor, sweet Angela...
I hope she's all right.

64
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:53,567
Who...who...who's there?

65
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,358
Hey... what're
you doing?

66
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,775
Finni, did you hear that
spooky noise?

67
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:03,067
Yeah... what was it?

68
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,483
Maybe it's the late
Lord Barrymore...

69
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,150
What if he's back
for revenge?

70
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:14,275
Uh... why are
you... happy?

71
00:06:14,358 --> 00:06:17,733
Oh, I simply adore a good scary
story, Finni, yes I do...!

72
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:20,275
I'm so excited,
I'm shivering!

73
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,150
Come on, let's
go investigate!

74
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:24,942
B-b-but why?!

75
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:31,775
It's all so horribly
frightening!

76
00:06:33,442 --> 00:06:35,317
That isn't a good thing.

77
00:06:51,775 --> 00:06:56,733
That tickles. No, not
so rough, careful

78
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,942
That's it... Good boy.

79
00:07:07,983 --> 00:07:10,150
This is scandalous,
yes it is...

80
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:11,858
Angela must be a very
hard woman

81
00:07:11,942 --> 00:07:13,400
to behave like this...

82
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:15,275
There she is, only hours
after her master

83
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:17,900
died a horrible death!

84
00:07:17,983 --> 00:07:20,108
Maybe that's what made her
so passionate?

85
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,650
Finni?

86
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:25,900
Finni?!

87
00:07:30,858 --> 00:07:34,442
Angela... Angela... Why?...

88
00:07:45,942 --> 00:07:47,692
Now he's lost it.

89
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:55,192
Good morning everyone.

90
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:02,442
Good morning.

91
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,192
Angela, are you sure you
should be out of bed?

92
00:08:06,275 --> 00:08:09,275
I'm fine... I'm sorry
for all the trouble.

93
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:10,900
My master would
be most disappointed

94
00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:13,733
in my weak behavior
in front of guests...

95
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:16,525
He always insisted
on courtesy first.

96
00:08:17,692 --> 00:08:20,483
Are you all right...?
You look so pale.

97
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,858
Oh, I'm sick! It's a tiny
little touch of the cold,

98
00:08:23,942 --> 00:08:24,858
nothing more...

99
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:26,067
But you shouldn't
get too close,

100
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,317
or you might catch it!
Sorry, bye!

101
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,025
For a sick bloke,
he sure can run quickly,

102
00:08:35,108 --> 00:08:36,275
don't you think?

103
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,442
Oh, my Angela...

104
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:49,067
Finni!

105
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:53,733
For today's tea, we have
a cabinet pudding...

106
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:57,567
It was made using
local blackberries.

107
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,233
You're certainly relaxed.

108
00:08:59,317 --> 00:09:01,983
Because we are in
no hurry, sir.

109
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:03,608
Sebastian, hurry!

110
00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:04,900
What's the matter
this time...?

111
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:06,233
Do calm down, please.

112
00:09:06,317 --> 00:09:08,317
We've looked all over, but
we can't find Angela!

113
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,608
Oh, is that all...? yeah
don't worry about it.

114
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:12,025
She said there were
some medicinal herbs

115
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:13,358
growing down by the fen...

116
00:09:13,442 --> 00:09:15,150
She went there to go pick
some up, that's all.

117
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:17,442
Right now...?. Why would she?

118
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:19,150
She went all alone when
there might be

119
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:21,400
a demon hound
out there?

120
00:09:21,483 --> 00:09:22,733
Oh, hell!

121
00:09:22,817 --> 00:09:25,692
What was she thinking,
going out all by herself?

122
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:27,567
She said she was worried...
You know...

123
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,233
about you being
kinda sick and all.

124
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:33,317
For me...?
She went for me?

125
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,067
Come on, Sebastian.
Let's go help 'im!

126
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,483
Well, uh...

127
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:40,775
Hurry...! Are you a red-blooded
man or aren't you...?

128
00:09:40,858 --> 00:09:43,025
Fine then... Let's go, Mei-Rin.

129
00:09:43,108 --> 00:09:44,108
Sir, yes, sir!

130
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:45,650
Where's Tanaka?

131
00:09:49,358 --> 00:09:52,317
That's the spirit...!
Okay, let's move out, men!

132
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,525
Sir, yes, sir!

133
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:08,442
You know... I'm
quite interested...

134
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,108
What color is
your blood?

135
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:14,525
At any rate... it looks as if
we do need to hurry now.

136
00:10:19,275 --> 00:10:21,775
Go out there, and put on a
good show for me...

137
00:10:21,858 --> 00:10:22,942
Am I clear?

138
00:10:24,067 --> 00:10:26,483
Perfectly... my young lord.

139
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,483
Angela!

140
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:43,692
Angela!

141
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:44,775
Angela!

142
00:10:44,858 --> 00:10:45,983
Angela!

143
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:46,525
Angela!

144
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:48,608
Angela!

145
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,108
Can you hear me?

146
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:57,733
Oh, Angela... Please...
answer us.

147
00:10:59,317 --> 00:11:00,525
What's wrong?

148
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:12,900
What are those?

149
00:11:12,983 --> 00:11:16,567
I don't think I can take
many more surprises!

150
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:23,608
Hey... look at that ring!

151
00:11:23,692 --> 00:11:25,775
It's Lord Henry's!

152
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,483
My, who's he?

153
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:55,067
A trophy... So it
really wasn't

154
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,317
the Demon Hound that killed
Lord Henry...

155
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,525
It was a human being,
after all.

156
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:03,567
Quite a specimen
of humanity, he is!

157
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,900
But why...?

158
00:12:04,983 --> 00:12:08,108
Did he have some sort of
grudge against Lord Henry?

159
00:12:08,192 --> 00:12:09,942
I wonder...

160
00:12:10,025 --> 00:12:12,317
Could Angela have
asked him to do it?

161
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,192
Say what...?
Why would Angela do that?

162
00:12:15,275 --> 00:12:16,358
Yeah, he's right!

163
00:12:16,442 --> 00:12:17,608
Easy, boy.

164
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:19,858
Angela has nothing to do
with this...!

165
00:12:19,942 --> 00:12:22,108
Don't just go around
accusing people.

166
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:23,483
Shh!

167
00:12:41,358 --> 00:12:43,942
What're you doing? Why're
you dressed like that?

168
00:12:44,025 --> 00:12:45,733
We're all going to bathe in
the waterfall

169
00:12:45,817 --> 00:12:48,692
to ease the wrath of the
Demon Hound.

170
00:12:48,775 --> 00:12:50,233
He's back... His terrible voice

171
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:52,608
echoed throughout the
village all last night.

172
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:54,317
He howled for hours
an' hours...

173
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,483
The demon's angry and
still among us!

174
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,150
A howl, eh?

175
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:11,150
Oi, Finni!
Come back!

176
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:15,233
All right, everyone, now
let's get to stretching!

177
00:13:15,317 --> 00:13:18,067
One, two...
one, two.

178
00:13:35,025 --> 00:13:37,192
Wha-... What is
that sound?

179
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,025
Uh-oh... He is real!

180
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,025
It's the Demon Houuuuuund!

181
00:14:06,983 --> 00:14:09,942
That fabric...
It's Angela's!

182
00:14:13,858 --> 00:14:16,025
What are you doing...?!
Finni...! Wait!

183
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,358
Angela!

184
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:24,858
Oh, hell...! Here,
give me that.

185
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:27,358
Time to show you
what I can do.

186
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:34,942
Bloody hell!

187
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:36,900
Why would you bring a toy
gun with you?!

188
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,983
Would you look at that...
So well trained.

189
00:14:58,067 --> 00:15:00,650
You even know how to
shake hands.

190
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,692
You were just
in time!

191
00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:07,442
But I'm afraid... well
trained or not...

192
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:09,608
you'll have to go now.

193
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:16,275
Come... this is no time to
be playing with a puppy.

194
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:17,733
Master!

195
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:21,108
Certainly... I shall finish
it off at once.

196
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:31,150
It smells irresistible,
doesn't it, dog?

197
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:33,525
This is what you
want, right?

198
00:15:33,608 --> 00:15:36,942
Inukko... The treat no dog
can refuse.

199
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:38,567
Dog treats?

200
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,650
Look out...! Sebastian!

201
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:48,733
There is only one way to
properly train a bad dog...

202
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:51,900
You must teach the creature...
to obey your every command.

203
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:54,442
Using rewards...
and punishments

204
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:56,942
Firstly... reward!

205
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:08,067
Okay, what's he
doing now?

206
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,775
I guess this
is... training?

207
00:16:11,692 --> 00:16:13,150
And now...

208
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:16,067
...punish!

209
00:16:20,192 --> 00:16:21,275
Reward.

210
00:16:21,358 --> 00:16:22,983
Punish!

211
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:24,108
Reward.

212
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,608
Punish!

213
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:29,108
Punnnnish!

214
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:35,358
Well, I suppose I did ask him
to put on a good show.

215
00:16:35,442 --> 00:16:38,942
And finally... A hug!

216
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:57,108
Sebastian!

217
00:17:01,108 --> 00:17:02,483
Uh... hello?

218
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:04,692
I don't see him
down there.

219
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:11,442
Quit dawdling down in that hole.
Get back here right now.

220
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:16,025
Yes sir.

221
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:26,608
Ow, ow...! Hot! Oi...! What
is this, a hot spring?

222
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:33,192
Um... where's Sebastain?

223
00:17:33,942 --> 00:17:36,650
This village is intended to be
a resort for the queen...

224
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:39,192
It needs a central attraction.

225
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:43,233
A luxury. A way
for visitors to relax

226
00:17:43,317 --> 00:17:46,358
and forget their cares...
That's what we have here...

227
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:48,400
A natural
hot spring!

228
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,483
Wow, he's amazing!

229
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:04,942
If I couldn't find a hot
spring or two for my master...

230
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:06,733
well then, what kind of
butler would I be?

231
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:08,858
The idea is simply
unthinkable.

232
00:18:12,483 --> 00:18:15,317
I don't know how much more
of this I can take!

233
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,275
Pluto!

234
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:19,442
"Pluto?"

235
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:28,983
Good boy...my good boy.

236
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:37,192
I'm sorry for the
confusion. This is Pluto.

237
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:38,733
I found him
last month.

238
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,817
I've always been
a big dog lover...

239
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,067
and he was so adorable, I
absolutely had to take him in.

240
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,900
"Adorable?"

241
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:48,983
He does have a
bad habit

242
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:52,233
of turning human when
he gets excited.

243
00:18:52,317 --> 00:18:53,692
"A habit?!"
You call it a 'habit'!?

244
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:55,317
So you sheltered and
fed him for a month

245
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,108
without telling
anybody else?

246
00:18:57,192 --> 00:18:58,900
That's right...
Lord Barrymore used

247
00:18:58,983 --> 00:19:02,108
the legend of the Demon Hound
to control the villagers...

248
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:06,233
But in truth... he feared the
hound more than anyone else...

249
00:19:06,317 --> 00:19:07,900
I didn't know what would
happen to Pluto

250
00:19:07,983 --> 00:19:09,442
if he found out.

251
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,525
I see now I was
too indulgent...

252
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:15,108
I never thought the sweet
boy would hurt

253
00:19:15,192 --> 00:19:16,733
Lord Barrymore.

254
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:22,067
I beg you, sir... Please
take him with you...

255
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,983
I know it's an imposition,
but would you bring him

256
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:26,150
to live at the
Phantomhive manor?

257
00:19:27,192 --> 00:19:29,025
You want us to keep
that monster?!

258
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:31,108
He needs a
firm hand...

259
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:32,983
I think if Sebastian was
there to train him,

260
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:34,567
he would become a
good dog.

261
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,983
No, thank you... I'm a butler,
not one hell of a dog trainer.

262
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:39,400
Why not?

263
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:44,858
Master... is this an order?

264
00:19:44,942 --> 00:19:50,442
It is... I think I'll find it
amusing...In several ways.

265
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:58,025
The curse of the great
Demon Hound is lifted!

266
00:19:58,108 --> 00:20:00,483
Oh, thank goodness!
We're finally free!

267
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,233
What's all
this about?

268
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:05,025
My lord... there is a legend
in this village

269
00:20:05,108 --> 00:20:07,233
that when the sins of our
ancestors against dogs

270
00:20:07,317 --> 00:20:08,858
have been fully
atoned for...

271
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:11,733
the land will weep tears
of forgiveness.

272
00:20:12,483 --> 00:20:14,733
The land's tears are
a blessing.

273
00:20:18,858 --> 00:20:20,733
Don't they realize the
hot spring has been there

274
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:22,733
under the ground
all along?

275
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:26,733
Likely not... At any rate,
our work here is done.

276
00:20:26,817 --> 00:20:28,858
I seem to recall you were
forced to eat your words

277
00:20:28,942 --> 00:20:32,775
earlier... Would you like to say
it again now that it's true?

278
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:34,608
Why don't you do it.

279
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:37,608
This case is now
officially closed.

280
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:44,858
Excellent... this is
just perfect.

281
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:48,442
Allow me, sir... traditional
hot springs service...

282
00:20:48,525 --> 00:20:50,608
You see, my lord...this is
how the Japanese

283
00:20:50,692 --> 00:20:52,483
enjoy hot springs.

284
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:00,317
It is a nice addition.

285
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:06,733
Hey...! Bring it over here!

286
00:21:06,817 --> 00:21:08,817
Goods for sale!
Reasonably priced!

287
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,900
Good selection! Come and
get 'em!

288
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:12,983
That gloomy village
has experienced

289
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:15,067
quite a
transformation.

290
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:19,025
I imagine it will be enough to
dispel the queen's worries.

291
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:21,025
Something tells me that
my worries

292
00:21:21,108 --> 00:21:22,692
are only just beginning.

293
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:34,275
Nice and snug... Don't ever
forget me... dear Pluto.

294
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:38,358
And put... some bloody...
clothes on alright...?

295
00:21:38,442 --> 00:21:40,900
Don't just let it all hang
out there...! Come on!

296
00:21:42,608 --> 00:21:45,400
Uh, well... It was
fun, Angela.

297
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:50,483
I'm sure we'll meet again
someday... my sweet boy.

298
00:21:53,317 --> 00:21:55,567
If you're finished...
shall we go?

299
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,983
Certainly...

300
00:21:57,067 --> 00:22:00,108
maybe someday I'll come to
visit Pluto at the estate.

301
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,233
I don't know if that would be
a good idea.

302
00:22:02,317 --> 00:22:03,483
What?

303
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:05,817
You were able to tame a
demon hound...

304
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,400
That's a task not many
people could do.

305
00:22:08,483 --> 00:22:10,108
You seem to have a
talent for

306
00:22:10,192 --> 00:22:12,900
wrapping lesser beings
around your finger.

307
00:22:16,483 --> 00:22:18,525
Let's go, Sebastian.

308
00:22:25,608 --> 00:22:28,858
Goodbye! I hope I'll see
you again!

309
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,358
One day...you shall.

310
00:24:11,025 --> 00:24:12,567
Talbot's camera, eh...?

311
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:16,817
What a delightful little toy
for a child to play with...

312
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,775
Would you like me to take
your picture?

313
00:24:20,608 --> 00:24:24,608
Oh dear... please... turn to
the right, young master...

314
00:24:24,692 --> 00:24:28,275
From the left your profile
is rather...

315
00:24:28,358 --> 00:24:30,817
...unfortunate, shall we say?

316
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,942
Next time, on
Black Butler:

317
00:24:33,025 --> 00:24:35,358
"His Butler, Phantom Image."

318
00:24:35,442 --> 00:24:37,858
You see... I'm simply one
hell of a butler.
