1
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,900
Run faster, damn it!
We can't let him get away...

2
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:31,233
Does Tim even know
how hard we worked

3
00:00:31,317 --> 00:00:33,983
to steal that thing...?
Let's go get it back!

4
00:00:48,192 --> 00:00:52,275
No one else will have it...
This is my ring now...

5
00:00:52,358 --> 00:00:56,733
No, I don't think so...
You do not deserve that ring.

6
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,692
The Hope Piece is in search
of a worthy master,

7
00:01:08,775 --> 00:01:11,942
you see... You do not
fit that description.

8
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,525
He jumped off the bridge!

9
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:24,942
That fool.

10
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:06,900
Ladies and gentlemen,
gather round!...

11
00:03:06,983 --> 00:03:10,233
The Frost Fair hasn't happened
in almost eighty years...!

12
00:03:10,317 --> 00:03:12,275
Don't miss your chance!

13
00:03:14,942 --> 00:03:17,442
Impressive. "Frost Fair"
certainly is

14
00:03:17,525 --> 00:03:19,233
an apt title for this.

15
00:03:22,275 --> 00:03:24,525
A large gathering held at the
foot of the London Bridge

16
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:26,858
when the Tehmz freezes over...

17
00:03:27,692 --> 00:03:29,108
From what I'm told,
it hasn't been held

18
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:34,192
for several decades now...
Not since 1814, apparently.

19
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:41,733
My lady, please...!
Slow down a bit!

20
00:03:41,817 --> 00:03:44,067
Careful... You're going to
crack the ice if you keep

21
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,025
stomping about like that.

22
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,525
Please understand, my lady...

23
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:52,442
If your parents learn
that we took a detour,

24
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:56,025
they'll be terribly angry.
I'll be in a lot of trouble.

25
00:03:56,108 --> 00:03:57,900
But Harrods and Liberty
were utterly useless...

26
00:03:57,983 --> 00:03:59,608
They had nothing to offer!

27
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:04,150
I was joking. It won't crack.

28
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:08,358
Excuse me, my lady... but
there seems to be something

29
00:04:08,442 --> 00:04:12,483
specific you've been searching
for. Might I ask what?

30
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:13,983
Something special...

31
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:17,150
I need a present for Ciel.
It's almost his birthday...

32
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:19,900
The perfect present.
One that will make him happy...

33
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:22,733
I mean very, very happy!

34
00:04:22,817 --> 00:04:25,567
Oh, Lady Elizabeth...

35
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,442
that... that is
absolutely adorable!

36
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:32,025
I understand now.
You have my word...

37
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:33,650
I pledge to help you
in whatever way

38
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:35,483
I can in this endeavor.

39
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,650
Thanks, Paula... How sweet.

40
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:39,983
Well...? Any word on Tim?

41
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:43,192
They found his body in the
ice. It appears the ring

42
00:04:43,275 --> 00:04:44,442
wasn't on him.

43
00:04:44,525 --> 00:04:46,317
Which means one thing.

44
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,358
Aye. The ring is in the Thames.

45
00:04:50,192 --> 00:04:52,650
Step on up, ladies and gents...

46
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:55,567
I've got bargains that would
blow even Jack Frost away.

47
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,858
Buy something
for someone special.

48
00:04:57,942 --> 00:04:59,608
Is there something amusing?

49
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:02,275
Those goods are all
of dubious quality.

50
00:05:02,358 --> 00:05:03,900
Funtom should set up a stall.

51
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:05,400
Any of our products
would be better than

52
00:05:05,483 --> 00:05:08,608
what that man is selling.
Like that, there.

53
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:12,150
Ah...! Hello there, noble lad...
You have a good eye.

54
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:14,150
That piece is one of a kind...

55
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:16,942
It was manufactured by the
Funtom Toy Company years ago...

56
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,775
back when it was still only
just a small craft studio.

57
00:05:20,858 --> 00:05:23,442
No... that is a blatant fake.

58
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:27,358
The Funtom Arks are rare...
only three were ever made...

59
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:29,567
My predecessor employed
the talent of an artist

60
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,233
incredibly skilled in his craft.

61
00:05:32,317 --> 00:05:36,108
Since our estate burned down,
even we no longer possess one.

62
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:42,317
One most certainly
wouldn't turn up here.

63
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,567
Noah's Ark... You know...
it reminds me of this country.

64
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,067
Why is that?

65
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,275
Think about it: a boat
captained by a single person.

66
00:05:51,358 --> 00:05:53,483
One filled with
only the select few who

67
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:55,358
have been chosen to be saved...

68
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:57,775
Rather arrogant,
don't you think?

69
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:01,692
Is that?...

70
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:05,442
A Scotland Yard inspector has
time to attend to the fair...

71
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:08,858
London must be very peaceful...
today, anyway.

72
00:06:08,942 --> 00:06:11,108
It's not...
I'm on duty right now!

73
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:14,025
Oh ...well, then, I'll
leave you to earn your wages

74
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:16,567
in faithful service
to the queen and country.

75
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,650
Good day, Inspector.

76
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:19,650
Wait, come back!
I have some questions

77
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:22,150
I want to ask you, Ciel!

78
00:06:24,192 --> 00:06:27,900
Pardon me... my master is a
touch fragile at the moment...

79
00:06:27,983 --> 00:06:30,817
er... I mean, sensitive.
Perhaps you could try to be

80
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,442
a trifle more gentle
when you're approaching him.

81
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,775
Now... what is an inspector
from the Yard doing here?

82
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:50,567
What's your business,
Abberline?

83
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,483
Murder. A man's corpse
was found this morning,

84
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:56,692
trapped in the ice on the Temz.

85
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:02,317
We learned he was a member of a
certain criminal organization...

86
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,567
I'm here because Scotland Yard
wants to hunt down

87
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,775
that man's killer and
we also want to recover

88
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:08,358
a ring that he stole...

89
00:07:08,442 --> 00:07:12,983
a blue diamond, one supposedly
worth around two thousand quid.

90
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:17,983
The diamond... The ultimate
symbol of eternal radiance.

91
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:20,733
A stone that bewitches all
those who see its sparkle...

92
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:24,192
What man wouldn't be inspired to
pursue such an exquisite prize,

93
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:28,233
even knowing all that
awaits him is total destruction.

94
00:07:28,317 --> 00:07:31,400
Impossible...! How do you know
about the Hope Piece?!

95
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:32,983
You're after the Hope Piece?

96
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:36,483
Oh...? Interesting...! Such a
gemstone really does exist?

97
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:38,067
Oh my.

98
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,900
Wha--... Hold on...!
But you were sayin'--

99
00:07:40,983 --> 00:07:43,608
It's best to ignore him...
He was blathering...

100
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:47,233
Anyway, Lau... what in the
world are you doing here?

101
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:50,567
I own this place,
my lord. Nice, eh?

102
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:54,775
Yes, of course you do.

103
00:07:56,483 --> 00:07:58,400
This 'Hope Piece'
you were talking about

104
00:07:58,483 --> 00:08:00,275
sounds fascinating, my lord...

105
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:03,150
Perhaps you could
tell me more about it?

106
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,858
Have you never heard of it?

107
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,692
A blue gem known
as the Hope Diamond...

108
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:10,567
Named after the man whose
collection it was a part of...

109
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,900
Henry Philip Hope.

110
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:13,317
Don't know it.

111
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,733
It passed to Louis the Sixteenth
and Marie Antoinette...

112
00:08:15,817 --> 00:08:17,358
We know how they ended...

113
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:19,942
The diamond is said
to be a cursed stone

114
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:23,567
that brings ruin
to all who possess it...

115
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,358
At one point it was stolen
and cut into smaller pieces

116
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:27,650
to disguise it...

117
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:30,858
Rumor has it that
two such pieces still exist.

118
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:35,317
Those shards of diamond
would certainly be valuable.

119
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,942
Tell me, Abberline... is that
what you're searching for?

120
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:42,108
The diamond was
being moved as evidence...

121
00:08:42,192 --> 00:08:45,650
It's carriage was attacked...
It was stolen.

122
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,733
Intriguing...
Give me details...

123
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:50,817
I would like to lend you
a hand in this case.

124
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,650
Of course, I can't force you...

125
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,608
But then... if you do
decide to refuse me...

126
00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:58,150
I can see to it that
Sir Arthur finds himself

127
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:00,942
in a rather awkward position.

128
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:04,150
Oh, look at these...!
Aren't they simply wonderful?!

129
00:09:06,317 --> 00:09:08,775
No...those won't do at all!

130
00:09:08,858 --> 00:09:11,775
Oh... You...
you don't think so...?

131
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:15,192
I thought they'd be an adorable
gift... Jingle, jingle!

132
00:09:15,275 --> 00:09:18,067
You don't understand at all,
Paula... Very well...

133
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,317
I'll search on my own!

134
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,067
Please, Lady Elizabeth!
Give me another chance!

135
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:31,942
Lady Elizabeth... Please!

136
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:41,692
You're sure this
is the right place?

137
00:09:41,775 --> 00:09:43,483
Yes...it is...
He set up shop here

138
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:45,192
because so many people
have been freezin' to death

139
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:47,275
during the Frost Fair.

140
00:09:47,358 --> 00:09:50,858
Inspector... you can't be
serious... Not him!

141
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:55,858
Yes Him and you lot can
wait right here outside.

142
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:58,233
You are lucky I let you
accompany me at all.

143
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:01,233
What a hopeless fool.

144
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:03,608
One of the privileges
of youth, my lord....

145
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:06,983
So... what is this place?

146
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:08,650
It's the Undertaker's parlor!

147
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,108
You met him during the Jack
the Ripper case, remember?!

148
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:12,317
Oh, right!

149
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,775
Abberline won't last one
minute in there.

150
00:10:14,858 --> 00:10:16,608
Sebastian... prepare to--

151
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:30,525
I assure you, man, you're
in the wrong profession!

152
00:10:30,608 --> 00:10:31,983
That was hysterical.

153
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:35,692
You could be
a world renowned comedian!

154
00:10:35,775 --> 00:10:37,192
What did you say to him?

155
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:40,275
I have no idea. I was just
talking to him normally...

156
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:42,525
He began laughing
like a madman.

157
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:47,608
How unexpected...
You aren't without talent.

158
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,900
It seems you're a man
to be reckoned with...

159
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:53,067
Most interesting.

160
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,192
But... I didn't do anything.

161
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,483
Tell me more about the ring...
I want to know it all.

162
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:05,233
The man you pulled out of the
river was the last to have it.

163
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:08,400
Perhaps it was frozen
in the ice near where

164
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:09,900
the body was found...

165
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:12,275
You are a citizen of our great
country, Mr. Undertaker...

166
00:11:12,358 --> 00:11:14,567
Please give us
your help in this matter.

167
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,942
As I said before, I'm
profoundly impressed with you,

168
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:20,442
Inspector.

169
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:25,317
I'll tell you everything...
Where is the ring, you ask?

170
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:28,983
You see... right there.

171
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,942
It appears that a sculptor must
have happened upon the ring

172
00:11:35,025 --> 00:11:36,692
and then designed
a beautiful ice sculpture

173
00:11:36,775 --> 00:11:39,692
to complement it.
Our mystery has been solved.

174
00:11:39,775 --> 00:11:41,233
Collect the ring right now!

175
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:43,067
Right!

176
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,150
What do you think
you're doing, thieves?!

177
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:52,650
That dear lady will be awarded
to the contest's victor.

178
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:55,067
You wouldn't want
to defile her, now would you?

179
00:11:57,192 --> 00:11:59,025
Viscount, Lord Druit!

180
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:16,233
They're holding some contest?
Why is he a judge?

181
00:12:16,317 --> 00:12:19,067
Yes, wasn't he just arrested
for human trafficking...?

182
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,483
What a naughty man.

183
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:22,733
He was released a few days ago.

184
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:24,233
Must've paid well.

185
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,067
Excuse me...

186
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,858
but this statue is now under
the charge of Scotland Yard.

187
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:33,108
Oh, no...! I don't care if you
are from Scotland Yard sir...

188
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:35,608
The Frost Fair is
an event for our citizens;

189
00:12:35,692 --> 00:12:37,317
I will not let you disrupt it.

190
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,358
Just look at her beauty...!
Such an exquisitely noble lady!

191
00:12:41,442 --> 00:12:44,233
We could never allow her
to be violated by anybody!

192
00:12:44,317 --> 00:12:45,608
You're one to talk.

193
00:12:45,692 --> 00:12:47,858
If you insist on
possessing this lady...

194
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:50,858
you should offer
something of equal beauty.

195
00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:54,483
A well-spoken pronouncement
from a true lover

196
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:55,983
of art and beauty...

197
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:59,525
As he says... if you want
this statue, win the contest.

198
00:12:59,608 --> 00:13:01,358
There's merit
to your argument...

199
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:04,108
The ring belongs to whomever is
the winner of the contest...

200
00:13:04,192 --> 00:13:05,525
Nice and simple.

201
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:06,692
Really, Ciel?

202
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:08,775
Don't worry, Inspector.
I'll get the ring.

203
00:13:08,858 --> 00:13:11,317
But it's stolen property...

204
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,108
Not to mention the fact
that it's our key evidence

205
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:16,483
in serial kidnappings
of young girls!

206
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:19,775
I see... That's why the Yard
is so frantic to find it.

207
00:13:19,858 --> 00:13:23,817
The legend is true. Every person
who has owned the ring

208
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,275
has met a horrible end...

209
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:28,108
It's a cursed stone, and
you'd still try to win it?

210
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:29,608
Cursed, eh?

211
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:32,692
Then it sounds like
the perfect ring for me.

212
00:13:32,775 --> 00:13:35,525
Come to think of it...
isn't that family ring you wear

213
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:38,233
set with a pretty
blue stone as well, lord?

214
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,108
Yes.

215
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:40,692
Perhaps you should be careful.

216
00:13:40,775 --> 00:13:42,608
Diamonds are quite hard...

217
00:13:42,692 --> 00:13:45,942
because they're hard,
they're also... brittle.

218
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,942
If you go too far...
you may be shattered as well.

219
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:51,733
I'm not concerned.

220
00:13:52,608 --> 00:13:56,150
My body... along with
my family ring...

221
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:59,192
Both have already been
shattered and then reborn.

222
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:02,858
I've been through too much
to worry about that anymore.

223
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:06,442
Win the contest...
That's an order.

224
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:08,858
Indeed... Young master.

225
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:14,317
It's settled, then...
go fill out an entry form.

226
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,442
Seriously?!

227
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:17,608
Are you an Irishman,
or aren't you?

228
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:20,358
We know more than the bloody
English about ice and snow!

229
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,858
R... Right!

230
00:14:21,942 --> 00:14:24,233
And if all else should fail...

231
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,608
Welcome, one and all
to the Thames Frost Fair...

232
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:32,192
Now, it is time
for the traditional

233
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:33,942
Ice Sculpture Contest.

234
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:37,108
You have until three p.m.

235
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:39,483
All right...
You may begin sculpting!

236
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,525
Oh, look at that!
Something's happening there...

237
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:46,692
it sounds excititing!

238
00:14:47,692 --> 00:14:49,358
Ciel...

239
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:52,608
I hate this ring!. Take it!

240
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,317
Forgive my master,
Lady Elizabeth,

241
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,942
but that ring was something
very important to him.

242
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,358
It's a precious
heirloom passed down

243
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:04,067
from the head of
the Phantomhive family...

244
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,233
He's grown quite attached to
it... It's truly one of a kind.

245
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:11,567
I'm sorry, Ciel...
I'm so sorry.

246
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,358
But I'll make it up to you...!

247
00:15:13,442 --> 00:15:15,692
I'll find you
an amazing present.

248
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,483
That ark...! I want it!

249
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,108
And now, folks...
the judging shall commence!

250
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:36,275
First up...
We have Scotland Yard and

251
00:15:36,358 --> 00:15:38,483
its Merry Men
with their sculpture...

252
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:40,275
"Guardian of London."

253
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,317
Judges' scores...
One, two, one, one, zero...!

254
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,567
For a total of five points.

255
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,025
Next team...

256
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:54,942
Who's name is "All Women's
Dresses Should be Tiny."...

257
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:56,817
And their entry....

258
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:03,400
For obvious reasons... this ice
sculpture has been disqualified.

259
00:16:03,483 --> 00:16:04,900
But why?

260
00:16:04,983 --> 00:16:07,108
How could you possibly think
that was proper to display?!

261
00:16:07,192 --> 00:16:09,150
You know, when they hide
bits like that,

262
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:11,317
I think it only
makes it more erotic.

263
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:16,942
Win this...You can, right?

264
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:19,900
Of course I can. You explicitly
ordered me to do so.

265
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:22,900
and I exist only to fulfill
your orders, my lord.

266
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,233
And next, from the team
known as Queen's Puppy,

267
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,817
we have... The Ark of Noah!

268
00:16:31,608 --> 00:16:34,567
What a sculpture!
I've never seen its like!

269
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:37,067
That is art in
its highest form!

270
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,858
An amazing piece...!
Let's see the total scores--

271
00:16:39,942 --> 00:16:41,775
One moment...

272
00:16:41,858 --> 00:16:45,150
My apologies, but you haven't
seen all of the sculpture yet.

273
00:16:53,942 --> 00:16:54,817
Wow!

274
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,900
They look like living animals!

275
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,192
Brilliant...!

276
00:16:58,275 --> 00:17:00,192
He deliberately made
the seam of the roof weak

277
00:17:00,275 --> 00:17:03,150
so it would melt
and fall apart in time.

278
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,358
Our ancestor!.

279
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,525
The brave man who stood
fearlessly against

280
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:11,192
the flood of God's wrath:
Noah...!

281
00:17:11,275 --> 00:17:13,108
He is depicted here with
the pairs of animals

282
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:17,442
he was ordered to rescue...
awaiting rebirth from the sea.

283
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:20,525
Astounding work, young man...
It's high art...

284
00:17:20,608 --> 00:17:23,233
I declare you an ice sculptor
of the highest caliber.

285
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:28,025
No, Sir...You're too kind... I
am simply one hell of a butler.

286
00:17:28,108 --> 00:17:31,108
So, uh... I don't think
we're gonna beat that.

287
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:33,942
Damn... Then on to plan B.

288
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:36,108
Is everyone ready
for the final scores?

289
00:17:36,192 --> 00:17:37,900
Hold it right there.

290
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:40,733
Hate to break up the party,
but this ring is ours...

291
00:17:40,817 --> 00:17:42,567
We're taking
what belongs to us.

292
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,900
Hold on...! That means
that you're the--

293
00:17:44,983 --> 00:17:47,567
That's right...! We're the team
of thieves all of London's

294
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,108
been talking about.
Maybe you recognize these?

295
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:57,108
You have ten seconds...

296
00:17:57,192 --> 00:17:59,025
Anyone who doesn't want
to die should get

297
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:01,608
the hell out of here... Ten...

298
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:04,025
Master?

299
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:05,400
Nine!

300
00:18:05,483 --> 00:18:09,442
My orders remain the same...
Do it now, Sebastian.

301
00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:11,608
Indeed... Young master.

302
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:12,608
Eight!

303
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:13,942
What are you doing...?
Hurry up.

304
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:15,525
We need to get out of here!

305
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:16,983
Seven!

306
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:19,775
You can go if you want to...
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

307
00:18:19,858 --> 00:18:20,483
Six!

308
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,400
I can't leave you here!

309
00:18:22,483 --> 00:18:25,275
I joined Scotland Yard
to protect our citizens...!

310
00:18:25,358 --> 00:18:28,942
That includes
noblemen like you Ciel!

311
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,525
What a fool.

312
00:18:32,858 --> 00:18:34,817
Stay back, inspector!

313
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,150
You only have
three seconds left...

314
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:41,317
A sweet little boy like you...
shouldn't you be running away?

315
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,150
I see no need for that.

316
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:44,733
Look behind you.

317
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:51,192
What the--?!

318
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:58,442
Impossible! He spun
four whole times in the air.

319
00:18:58,525 --> 00:19:00,400
A noble swan
flying through a world

320
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:02,025
of silvery-white snow!

321
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:05,150
Lured by that devilish smile,
the maiden is enfolded

322
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:07,525
in his midnight-black wings!

323
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:16,692
Ten, ten, ten, ten, ten...

324
00:19:16,775 --> 00:19:18,275
That's it! A perfect score!

325
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:23,775
Damn you... Little brat...
I'm gonna blow you away!

326
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,025
Again...?! I hate this guy.

327
00:19:44,358 --> 00:19:47,192
Please Boss, stop doing that!

328
00:19:47,275 --> 00:19:48,733
Have you forgotten?

329
00:19:48,817 --> 00:19:52,733
Look down...!. We're
standing on top of ice!

330
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,483
Sebastian!

331
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,108
Where is he?

332
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:15,358
My lord is stubborn as ever.

333
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:27,942
The ship sails on...
leaving human despair behind!

334
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:29,358
The ship sails on!

335
00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:31,567
Carrying the future
of the world...!

336
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,775
The ship sails on despite the
raging flood of icy waters

337
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:38,108
seeking to drown it...
The ship sails on!

338
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:42,108
It's the ark... Truly
a recreation of Noah's Ark...!

339
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:45,525
We've seen a miracle
on the Thames!

340
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:48,317
Was tossing me about
like that really necessary?

341
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,983
My apologies sir... But we did
have an audience, after all.

342
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:54,442
I thought it might add
a bit of flair to the show.

343
00:20:57,108 --> 00:20:58,692
The Hope Diamond
will sleep safely

344
00:20:58,775 --> 00:21:02,150
at the bottom of the Thames.
Not a bad end.

345
00:21:03,358 --> 00:21:06,025
But won't it curse
all of London now?

346
00:21:06,108 --> 00:21:08,275
Somehow I doubt
that will happen...

347
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:10,108
Besides if a ring
can destroy this city,

348
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:12,942
it wasn't meant to survive...
After all...

349
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:15,233
We Phantomhives have lived on.

350
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,775
Grab my hand! I've got you.

351
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:19,108
Tell me something...

352
00:21:19,192 --> 00:21:22,067
Earlier, you had accused
Noah of being arrogant...

353
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,650
But he was only
trying to save a few...

354
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:26,567
Wouldn't the desire
to protect everyone

355
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,858
be even more arrogant?

356
00:21:27,942 --> 00:21:30,567
Yes, it would seem so.

357
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,817
Ah, well...

358
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,608
An arrogant fool like
that every now and then

359
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,358
might not be so bad.

360
00:21:38,358 --> 00:21:42,150
Ciel... Who exactly are you?

361
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:47,525
What's the matter?

362
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:52,400
My father... he said
this was obviously a fake.

363
00:21:52,483 --> 00:21:54,442
It's awful... I thought...

364
00:21:54,525 --> 00:21:56,858
I thought I'd found
something to make Ciel happy!

365
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:59,900
I'm so sorry...!
Please cheer up! here,

366
00:21:59,983 --> 00:22:02,525
I have just the thing!
Jingle, jingle, jingle--

367
00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:04,525
Leave me alone!

368
00:22:10,858 --> 00:22:12,733
Ciel... I'm sorry.

369
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:16,483
I just... wanted to
give you a wonderful gift.

370
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:26,108
So I thought to myself...

371
00:22:26,192 --> 00:22:27,692
Why not let
the hope diamond find

372
00:22:27,775 --> 00:22:31,608
a new owner on its own...
Eh, master?

373
00:24:11,358 --> 00:24:13,942
The ring's stone flickers
like a blue abyss...

374
00:24:14,025 --> 00:24:16,608
an inescapable
promise of death...

375
00:24:16,692 --> 00:24:19,025
Meanwhile, the organ
plays a broken melody,

376
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:21,108
its tune faltering.

377
00:24:21,192 --> 00:24:25,608
Listen well, young master...
You must not trust bad men...

378
00:24:25,692 --> 00:24:29,858
No... I'm sorry...
What I meant was red men.

379
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:32,358
Next time, on Black Butler...

380
00:24:32,442 --> 00:24:34,692
"His Butler,
However You Please."

381
00:24:34,775 --> 00:24:37,733
You see... I am simply
one hell of a butler.
