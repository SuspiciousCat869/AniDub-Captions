1
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:20,983
Noooo!

2
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:22,567
Oh dear oh dear oh dear!

3
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,567
Ahhhh!

4
00:00:31,442 --> 00:00:35,233
Hot! Hot hot hot hot hot hot!

5
00:00:35,317 --> 00:00:38,983
Ah! I'm so sorry!
I'll wipe it off!

6
00:00:44,817 --> 00:00:48,650
Master... why did you agree
to take in such a useless idiot?

7
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:52,233
You're one to talk, Bard.
It didn't seem like

8
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:53,775
such a bad idea.

9
00:00:53,858 --> 00:00:56,525
Oh Ciel, darling.
I have a problem.

10
00:00:56,608 --> 00:00:58,275
Grell is hopelessly incompetent.

11
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,942
Could you do me a tiny favor
and have Sebastian train him

12
00:01:01,025 --> 00:01:02,108
to be a decent butler?

13
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:05,567
Can't refuse your
favorite aunt, can you?

14
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,483
I thought Sebastian would be
the only one inconvenienced...

15
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:11,608
I never expected that I would
be affected by it as well.

16
00:01:11,692 --> 00:01:13,317
Ho ho ho.

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,775
I'm so sorry for causing
all this trouble...!

18
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:18,442
I simply don't know how
I can apologize enough.

19
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:21,567
Wait that's it! The only
thing I can do now is die!

20
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:24,858
I shall atone with my death!

21
00:01:24,942 --> 00:01:26,525
Whoa...! Calm down a second!

22
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:28,733
Um...Should we take
the knife away?

23
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,442
There is no need for that.

24
00:01:34,525 --> 00:01:36,650
Just think of the horrible
mess you would make...

25
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:39,608
It'd take hours to clean up
all of the blood.

26
00:01:39,692 --> 00:01:43,942
Thank you, Sebastian...
You're so very kind.

27
00:01:44,025 --> 00:01:45,525
That was kindness?

28
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:49,608
Now, what I'd like to know...
is how you could think it was

29
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,650
ever acceptable to serve
the master such weak tea.

30
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:55,775
Watch me... a spoonful for
each person and one more

31
00:01:55,858 --> 00:01:57,775
for the pot.

32
00:01:57,858 --> 00:02:01,317
Finally... add a half-pint of
boiling water and let it steep

33
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,608
until dark.

34
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:12,817
Master... Are you ready?
It is almost time...

35
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,733
I have the carriage waiting
for you in the front drive now.

36
00:02:15,817 --> 00:02:16,983
Fine.

37
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:18,358
As for the rest of you...

38
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:21,150
I want this place absolutely
spotless, understand?

39
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:23,442
Grell... perhaps you should
just sit there and relax

40
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:25,358
so you don't cause
any more trouble.

41
00:02:27,817 --> 00:02:30,733
And... If you do decide
to seek your eternal rest...

42
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,108
please see to it outside,
would you, and try not to make

43
00:02:33,192 --> 00:02:34,983
too big a mess.

44
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:38,608
What generosity...!
What great kindness!

45
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:23,775
Get your paper here...!
All the latest news!

46
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:26,608
Prostitute
mysteriously murdered!

47
00:04:31,775 --> 00:04:33,525
Oh, hello, boy...

48
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:35,525
Did your father send you
for something?

49
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:39,442
Actually, he's here
on his own business.

50
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:40,983
We need to pick this up.

51
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:43,942
Oh...you're here
for that walking stick.

52
00:04:45,192 --> 00:04:49,150
I was wondering who would have a
use for one as short as this...

53
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:51,775
Naturally...
I didn't think a chi--

54
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,317
Straight as an arrow...

55
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,817
a magnificent stick,
indeed, good sir.

56
00:05:02,817 --> 00:05:05,108
Keep the change. Good day.

57
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,608
That ridiculous strength
of Finny's is a menace...

58
00:05:11,692 --> 00:05:14,817
How could someone accidentally
break a walking stick...?

59
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,400
It's a pain to
special order a new one.

60
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,025
Certainly- what a pity to go
to all that trouble...

61
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:22,192
you haven't even had
a growth spurt in years.

62
00:05:23,108 --> 00:05:24,817
And speaking of trouble,
I don't know how well

63
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,650
Grell is going to work out...
We shouldn't stay away

64
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:29,192
for too long.

65
00:05:29,275 --> 00:05:33,442
Look, Mama! It's the brand new
rabbit toy from Funtom! See?

66
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:38,900
The Funtom Company. The maker
of toys and confections

67
00:05:38,983 --> 00:05:41,983
has grown rapidly
in the last three years.

68
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:45,942
And this estate testifies
to the company's prosperity.

69
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:48,775
The manor is magnificent,
don't you think?

70
00:05:48,858 --> 00:05:51,983
You know, it's only been around
for about two years now.

71
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:54,983
Odd...? But it looks
so stately and dignified.

72
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:58,150
Of course it does...
That was the intention.

73
00:06:00,483 --> 00:06:02,483
Look! It's the real Tanaka!

74
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,567
We haven't seen him in months!

75
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,608
This manor was specifically
built to be an exact replica

76
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:09,150
of the previous one...

77
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:12,067
It is identical in every single
detail, from the windowpanes

78
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,275
to the stairways and even
the cracks in the pillars.

79
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:17,150
Identical?

80
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:21,442
The original Phantomhive manor
burned down three years ago...

81
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:24,275
The entire estate
was engulfed in flames.

82
00:06:24,358 --> 00:06:26,775
It was a great tragedy.

83
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:30,650
Oh...oh, I see...
Forgive me for asking...

84
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:33,192
but Master Ciel's
parents... did they...?

85
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:37,400
Yes... Sadly, they both
perished in the fire.

86
00:06:44,358 --> 00:06:46,358
How terrible--that poor boy.

87
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,650
Oh, no! Tanaka!

88
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:54,317
His energy and stamina levels
are way below a normal person's.

89
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,692
Bein' Real Tanaka exhausts him.
He just needs to rest himself

90
00:06:57,775 --> 00:06:58,400
for awhile.

91
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:00,025
Oh. That's interesting.

92
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:13,775
Why're they all skulls?

93
00:07:13,858 --> 00:07:17,275
No! Not again! I've made yet
another unacceptable mistake!

94
00:07:17,358 --> 00:07:19,358
I can't go on any longeeeer!

95
00:07:19,442 --> 00:07:21,067
Quit tryin' to die all the time!

96
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,733
But I have to...! It's the
only way to redeem my honor!

97
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:30,442
Grell!

98
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:40,233
I'm sure you're tired, master.
I'll prepare tea for you

99
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:41,317
immediately.

100
00:07:45,692 --> 00:07:46,775
What's the matter?

101
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:55,358
My mansion?

102
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:58,733
What happened to this place...?
Why it's a disaster!

103
00:07:58,817 --> 00:08:01,692
Sebastian! Sebastian!

104
00:08:01,775 --> 00:08:03,567
What is going on here...?

105
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,025
And why on earth are you all
dressed like lunatics?!

106
00:08:06,108 --> 00:08:08,275
She's crazy...! Crazy!

107
00:08:08,358 --> 00:08:09,692
Who is crazy?

108
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:18,775
What are you doing now?!

109
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:21,317
At the moment, I believe
I'm in the process of dying,

110
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,108
Master Ciel.

111
00:08:23,192 --> 00:08:25,317
Get him down, Sebastian.

112
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,483
Yes, sir.

113
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:29,317
Ciel!

114
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:33,317
Ciel...! You're back!
I missed you so much!

115
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,192
Elizabeth, what a surprise!

116
00:08:35,275 --> 00:08:38,442
Oh...! How many times do I have
to tell you call me Lizzie!

117
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:40,692
Aww, you really are
just the cutest thing ever,

118
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:43,608
aren't you, darling boy?
I could just eat you up!

119
00:08:43,692 --> 00:08:45,192
Lady Elizabeth.

120
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,233
Oh, hello Sebastian...
How are you?

121
00:08:48,317 --> 00:08:50,525
Aww... you took him down?

122
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:53,150
Yes. He detracted from
the beauty of the room.

123
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:56,900
But I made such a lovely
decoration out of him!

124
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:58,442
A decoration?

125
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:03,358
Yes! Just look at it all!
Isn't the salon so cute now?

126
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,317
My mansion... It's so pink.

127
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,608
From now on, only the
cutest things belong in

128
00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:09,733
the Phantomhive manor!

129
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:11,817
Don't you agree, Antoinette?

130
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:13,775
Ho ho ho.

131
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:16,275
Oh, And Tanaka?

132
00:09:16,358 --> 00:09:18,567
And I have
a present for you too.

133
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:23,150
Here. You're always dressed in
black. I thought this would be

134
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:25,650
a nice change.
What do you think?

135
00:09:29,483 --> 00:09:31,775
I am deeply honored that
you went to so much trouble

136
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:35,567
for a humble servant... Your
generosity overwhelms me.

137
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,108
Happy to help!

138
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:39,608
In any event, Lizzie.
What are you doing here...?

139
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:41,358
Auntie didn't let you
come alone?

140
00:09:41,442 --> 00:09:44,567
I sneaked away because
I wanted to see you, silly!

141
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,025
You... sneaked away...?

142
00:09:46,108 --> 00:09:47,483
Don't you think
you'll get into trouble?

143
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:50,317
Um, Sebastian...
who is this girl?

144
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,567
She... is the daughter
of the Marquess of Scotney...

145
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,942
Her full Christian name is

146
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:58,525
Lady Elizabeth Ethel Cordelia
Midford of Scotney.

147
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:02,442
Scotney-ethel-elizabeth-
cordelia-mid--

148
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:04,192
She is actually my young
master's betrothed,

149
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:05,608
of several years.

150
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:08,483
Ah... his fiancée,
yes of course--

151
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,108
Master...!

152
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,108
Marrying...?!

153
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:12,317
Her?!

154
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,608
Lady Elizabeth is of
the nobility, after all.

155
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:16,150
She is the daughter
of a Marquess...

156
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:19,317
Nobles marry other nobles...
That's how it works.

157
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,233
Oooh...! I know! Now that the
manor is decorated so prettily,

158
00:10:24,317 --> 00:10:26,317
why don't we have
a ball tonight!?

159
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:29,858
You can be my escort,
and we'll dance around

160
00:10:29,942 --> 00:10:33,025
all night long!
Isn't that a wonderful idea!

161
00:10:33,108 --> 00:10:34,733
A ball...? No!

162
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:37,150
You'll wear the clothes
I picked out for you, won't you?

163
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:39,608
Pretty please!
They'll be so cute on you!

164
00:10:39,692 --> 00:10:41,025
Listen, I don't want t--

165
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,400
And of course, I'll be
dressed to the nines as well!

166
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:45,358
You come with me. I want
to make you even cuter

167
00:10:45,442 --> 00:10:46,900
than you already are!

168
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:51,275
Wait, I said no baaall!!

169
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:00,108
I believe the wisest
course of action is to

170
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,650
go along with her plan...

171
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:04,233
I don't think she is
going to listen to reason.

172
00:11:04,317 --> 00:11:06,067
Can't you just give her
some tea or something

173
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,733
and get her out of here...?

174
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:10,733
I don't have time
for a stupid ball.

175
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:13,358
My lord... Lady Elizabeth
would like a dance.

176
00:11:13,442 --> 00:11:15,025
You cannot refuse her.

177
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:20,608
Master...

178
00:11:20,692 --> 00:11:22,483
What now?

179
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:24,483
I know I've never
seen you dance before...

180
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,483
but I assume that you can?

181
00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:31,358
Oh, I see...

182
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:33,483
Well, that explains
why you're always such

183
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,608
a wallflower
at social engagements.

184
00:11:35,692 --> 00:11:37,150
I have too much work to do...

185
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:39,650
I don't have time
to waste on dancing.

186
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,858
With all due respect...

187
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:45,358
Dancing is a necessary skill
for a person of your position

188
00:11:45,442 --> 00:11:47,525
to possess. In your line
of work, Master...

189
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:50,233
social contacts are
important to maintain.

190
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,442
The world expects
any noble gentleman

191
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:55,775
to possess at least
rudimentary dance skills...

192
00:11:55,858 --> 00:11:58,192
If you turn down too many
invitations simply because

193
00:11:58,275 --> 00:12:00,608
you cannot dance, your
reputation in high society

194
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:01,942
will suffer greatly.

195
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:04,358
Fine, I'll do it...
Now stop the lecture...

196
00:12:04,442 --> 00:12:06,567
Call me in a private tutor
or something...

197
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,608
Mrs. Bright or Mrs. Rodkin
should work well enough.

198
00:12:10,358 --> 00:12:12,692
We don't have sufficient time
to call in a tutor for you,

199
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:15,108
my lord...
There's only one option.

200
00:12:17,317 --> 00:12:20,150
With your permission,
I will be your dance instructor.

201
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:22,150
Don't be ridiculous...
I'm not going to take

202
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:25,358
dancing instruction from a man!
Besides, do you even know

203
00:12:25,442 --> 00:12:26,692
how to dance?

204
00:12:26,775 --> 00:12:30,233
The Viennese waltz is my
specialty... I was a guest

205
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,983
at the Schonbrunn Palace
in Vienna from time to time.

206
00:12:36,192 --> 00:12:38,733
Now, if you would do me
the honor, my lady...

207
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:40,442
May I have this dance?

208
00:12:52,442 --> 00:12:56,150
Let's begin. To lead, you start
the first step on your heel...

209
00:12:57,192 --> 00:13:00,567
Be sure to keep your hand
firmly upon the lady's back.

210
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,983
When the music starts,
lead with your left foot. Now.

211
00:13:07,858 --> 00:13:12,358
Next, we'll try a Natural Turn.
Slide your foot forward,

212
00:13:12,442 --> 00:13:13,525
like this.

213
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:25,358
Your natural ability for dancing
is not so much lacking--

214
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:28,692
as it is nonexistent, my lord...
You cannot simply cling

215
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,942
for dear life
onto your dance partner.

216
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:32,817
You're too tall.
It's not working!

217
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,983
Most importantly... You need
to wipe that gloomy look

218
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:37,608
off of your face.

219
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,983
The lady will
take it as an insult.

220
00:13:40,442 --> 00:13:43,983
Now, let's have a smile...
Pretend that it's fun.

221
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:45,567
Let me go!

222
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,608
Master!

223
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:54,108
I can't smile! I forgot how.
I don't know how to pretend like

224
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:56,192
I'm having fun...

225
00:13:56,275 --> 00:13:58,358
Not anymore.

226
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:11,692
How... awful...! This is the
most humiliating outfit ever!

227
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:14,192
I think you're going to have
to make peace with it.

228
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:16,233
This dress... it's atrocious!

229
00:14:16,317 --> 00:14:19,067
So white and girly and frilly!
If I have to dress up

230
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,233
why can't it be in
a sexy shade of red,

231
00:14:21,317 --> 00:14:23,483
with a waistline that
would flatter my figure?!

232
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:25,400
That's your problem with it?

233
00:14:25,483 --> 00:14:27,983
I can't live with
a shame as deep as this!

234
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,567
No...! I'd rather die!

235
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,608
You aren't going to try
to stop me this time?

236
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:41,067
Blue is definitely
Ciel's color!

237
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,942
It will look so good on him.

238
00:14:43,025 --> 00:14:44,442
You should see
the clothes I found!

239
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:46,567
I got them today in
London. They're great!

240
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,275
He'll look dashing!

241
00:14:48,358 --> 00:14:50,525
Now... time to get you
dressed up...!

242
00:14:50,608 --> 00:14:52,817
I'll make you look so adorable!

243
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:55,900
I'm really farsighted!

244
00:14:55,983 --> 00:14:58,858
I can't see anything without
my glasses, my lady!

245
00:14:58,942 --> 00:15:00,983
You don't have to see
at a ball to have fun...

246
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,775
Now hand those over, silly!

247
00:15:02,858 --> 00:15:03,692
No, no, no, please!

248
00:15:03,775 --> 00:15:05,983
Just leave her alone.

249
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,608
Ciel! You look adorable!

250
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,442
That outfit
is absolutely perfect!

251
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:23,983
Ciel... Why aren't you wearing
the ring I brought you...?

252
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:27,317
It matches your clothing
perfectly. Now where did it go?!

253
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,233
The ring I already
have on will work.

254
00:15:29,317 --> 00:15:33,400
No! I went to so much trouble
and that ring isn't cute at all!

255
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:36,400
Why won't you wear the ring I
picked out specially for you?!

256
00:15:36,483 --> 00:15:37,900
You're so cruuuuel!

257
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,567
I just want everything to be
perfect for our lovely ball!

258
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,775
That's not it... Lizzie,
this ring is--

259
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,900
Hah...! Fooled you!

260
00:15:44,983 --> 00:15:46,942
It's mine now!

261
00:15:47,025 --> 00:15:48,150
Lizzie!

262
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:50,150
This is far too big for you.
The one I bought

263
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:52,483
will fit perfectly.
Just put it on and--

264
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:53,817
Give it back!

265
00:15:57,692 --> 00:16:00,067
Give me that ring...
Now, Elizabeth!

266
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,233
Wh... why are you
so angry at me...?

267
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:05,692
I just... wanted...

268
00:16:07,358 --> 00:16:10,483
What's wrong? I just wanted to
make everything look adorable,

269
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:11,817
that's all...

270
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,567
So why-why are you so angry?!

271
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,108
I hate this ring! Take it!

272
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:36,817
Master, you forgot the walking
stick we went to so much trouble

273
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,900
to get.

274
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:50,733
Forgive my master, Lady
Elizabeth, but that ring

275
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:52,942
was something
very important to him.

276
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:54,567
It's a precious heirloom
passed down to the head

277
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,650
of the Phantomhive family.
He's grown quite

278
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:59,900
attached to it.
It's truly one of a kind.

279
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:03,400
Please try to understand...
Why this upset him

280
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:07,692
It... it was that important...
and I destroyed it...?

281
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:14,192
Oh, Ciel... Please, I--

282
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:23,358
Ciel, wait! What are you doing?!

283
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,400
It doesn't matter. It was
nothing but an old ring,

284
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:32,483
after all. Even without it,
I'm still the head

285
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:36,067
of the Phantomhives...
And that won't change!

286
00:17:43,858 --> 00:17:46,358
How long are you going to cry?

287
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:49,025
I... I'm so sorry!

288
00:17:50,275 --> 00:17:54,025
Your face is a mess! Completely
unsuitable for a lady.

289
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:58,525
How could I possibly ask
a lady with a runny nose

290
00:17:58,608 --> 00:18:01,233
and puffy eyes to dance?

291
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:02,858
To dance?

292
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:13,358
He's incredible!

293
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:17,067
He plays the violin?
Is there anything he can't do?

294
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,650
Ah...! I'll join him!

295
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:30,567
What the hell...?
He can actually sing!

296
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:38,775
So then, we are agreed...?
We'll forget our cares

297
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:42,150
and dance the night away...
It's decided.

298
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:46,733
Yes!

299
00:19:26,775 --> 00:19:29,483
Don't worry, I'll make sure
she gets home safely.

300
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:31,108
You can count on me.

301
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:32,567
Are you sure?

302
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,025
Indeed. I'm more deadly
efficient than I appear.

303
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,692
Thank you so much, Sebastian...
I'm in your debt-

304
00:19:38,775 --> 00:19:41,650
you've taught me a lot about
what it means to be a butler...

305
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:43,775
They say that before
a person dies his life

306
00:19:43,858 --> 00:19:45,650
flashes before him.

307
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:47,817
and I know that when
I see the light of death,

308
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,525
this momentous evening
is what will appear to me

309
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:52,608
in my dying vision.

310
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:56,275
Interesting that
you would say that.

311
00:19:56,358 --> 00:20:00,608
That's true. He hasn't been very
good at dying so far, has he?

312
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:07,025
It's finally over.
What a horrible day it's been.

313
00:20:07,108 --> 00:20:09,442
You seemed to be enjoying
yourself for awhile there,

314
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:10,525
my lord.

315
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:13,317
Don't be so foolish.

316
00:20:14,942 --> 00:20:16,817
Am I the fool here?

317
00:20:19,275 --> 00:20:21,483
I know the importance
of this ring...

318
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:24,400
and yet, you put on
that act for Lady Elizabeth.

319
00:20:28,775 --> 00:20:31,608
If I couldn't do this much
for my Master...

320
00:20:31,692 --> 00:20:35,775
well, then what kind
of butler would I be?

321
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:38,150
But you should take care.
It is precious.

322
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:42,692
This ring...
It has seen so much.

323
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:46,317
That is true.
It's always there.

324
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,233
This ring has seen
the death of many masters.

325
00:20:49,317 --> 00:20:52,525
My grandfather...
my father... and eventually,

326
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:56,067
the ring will witness
my own death as well.

327
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,692
It's heard the dying screams
of the Phantomhive family

328
00:20:58,775 --> 00:21:01,150
for generation upon generation.

329
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:03,983
When I close my eyes,
I hear them too...

330
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:06,858
voices echoing in my head...

331
00:21:06,942 --> 00:21:09,400
"If I throw the ring away...
I won't have to listen

332
00:21:09,483 --> 00:21:12,025
to them screaming anymore"

333
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:17,525
...at least that's what I
believed. Ridiculous, yes?

334
00:21:22,025 --> 00:21:25,317
My... look how high
the moon has risen.

335
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,858
You must get some rest, sir.
Don't want to make yourself ill,

336
00:21:28,942 --> 00:21:29,942
do you?

337
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:40,942
Sebastian... stay with me...
until I fall asleep?

338
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,233
Goodness... Are you displaying
weakness in front of me now?

339
00:21:47,317 --> 00:21:49,275
Just a simple order.

340
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,733
I will stay here... I am
by your side forever, master.

341
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:01,858
Until the end...

342
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:14,942
I'm still the head
of the Phantomhives...

343
00:22:15,025 --> 00:22:19,192
That won't change!
Stay with me...

344
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:34,525
Now...I must
prepare for tomorrow.

345
00:24:11,442 --> 00:24:13,150
The mysterious
prostitute murders

346
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:14,900
are getting out of hand...

347
00:24:14,983 --> 00:24:16,650
Unfortunately,
in order to solve them,

348
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:18,567
my master may have to
do something with which

349
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,692
he is not quite at ease...

350
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:22,817
Now, now, my lord,
don't be shy...

351
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,650
You look quite fetching
in a dress...

352
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:26,942
Remember, it's for
a good cause, after all...

353
00:24:27,025 --> 00:24:30,567
Besides, you have to admit,
it's pretty comfortable.

354
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,817
Next time, on Black Butler...

355
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,733
"His Butler, Capricious."

356
00:24:34,817 --> 00:24:38,067
You see, I am simply
one hell of a butler.
