1
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,650
Ooh...! What a nicely
mangled corpse this is...!

2
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:30,942
Maybe instead of covering
up the wounds,

3
00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:32,858
I could accentuate
them with pink dye,

4
00:00:32,942 --> 00:00:35,442
like the petals
of a lovely flower.

5
00:00:36,858 --> 00:00:41,692
So much fun! So much fun!
What a great job I have.

6
00:00:44,817 --> 00:00:47,567
Now let's see...
Who do we have next?

7
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:53,150
No, I don't like this one bit.
This is most unsatisfying.

8
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:55,858
Not a single wound
anywhere on the body...

9
00:00:55,942 --> 00:00:57,733
How pathetic.

10
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,483
Excuse me, but what
did you just say?!

11
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,692
This morning
you have a dance lesson

12
00:02:50,775 --> 00:02:52,150
with Mrs. Bright...

13
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:54,942
This afternoon an appointment
with Lord Wensler,

14
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:59,192
an import exporter... are you
listening to me, my lord?

15
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:01,775
I told you, I'm sick
of dancing lessons...

16
00:03:01,858 --> 00:03:03,608
It's not for me.

17
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:06,733
You are too modest. Your
dancing soothes the heart

18
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:09,483
of everybody who
sees it in action.

19
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:12,275
By making them laugh...?
Is that what you mean...?

20
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,400
It is isn't it?

21
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:16,400
No, I would never say that.

22
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:25,900
Look, Tanaka!
Three upright tea stalks.

23
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,942
I think it promises
to be an excellent day.

24
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:34,483
Wait, I know you!
You're the queen's butler!

25
00:03:36,442 --> 00:03:38,233
Greetings, Lord Phantomhive...

26
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:41,692
I do apologize for this
embarrassing display.

27
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:45,192
Why is the Queen's butler here
sipping tea at my estate.

28
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:47,150
So sorry, I thought you
were aware of his role,

29
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:49,442
young master...
This entire time...

30
00:03:49,525 --> 00:03:51,858
Ashe has been her
personal messenger...

31
00:03:51,942 --> 00:03:53,150
His job is
to deliver the orders

32
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,442
her majesty sends out
for you my lord.

33
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:57,858
That's not a job for a butler.

34
00:03:57,942 --> 00:04:00,025
Forgive me,
but I beg to differ...

35
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:01,817
If I couldn't consult
the Doomsday Book

36
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,858
for those requesting an
audience with her Majesty

37
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:05,775
and travel here
to deliver a simple message

38
00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:07,483
and then stop for
an elegant tea break,

39
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:09,358
what kind of butler would I be?

40
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,692
Yes, well...

41
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:14,608
having a tea break is
hardly a duty for a butler.

42
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:19,483
Well... if I may...
to what do we

43
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:21,067
owe the pleasure?

44
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,317
Oh, indeed.

45
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,692
Outside of Preston
there is a Catholic abbey...

46
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,817
It was burned down
during the Reformation

47
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,150
and is no longer in use.

48
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:34,900
A cult practicing the
Isna religion has begun

49
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,775
gathering there.

50
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,650
We have received word
that the cult's leader

51
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:44,525
is in possession of
the Doomsday Books

52
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:46,608
of all its many followers.

53
00:04:46,692 --> 00:04:48,317
You mean the land registers...?

54
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,067
Where all livestock and
property is recorded...?

55
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,817
I don't understand. What could
he possibly want with that?

56
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,775
Oh no... their
Doomsday Books are

57
00:04:56,858 --> 00:04:58,483
quite a bit different
than that...

58
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:01,317
They aren't the normal
records you're used to.

59
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:05,858
They don't cover property.
These are the records required

60
00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:08,192
when you stand before
the Lord in Heaven

61
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:12,067
on Doomsday...
the Day of Judgment...

62
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,900
All your sins and
your good works are

63
00:05:13,983 --> 00:05:16,150
supposedly recorded there.

64
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:24,067
I'm getting weary
of the occult.

65
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,692
There have been most
distressing rumors circling.

66
00:05:26,775 --> 00:05:28,233
Apparently,
they're planning a coup

67
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:31,608
against the government...
Their activities as of late

68
00:05:31,692 --> 00:05:34,608
have made the people
of Preston quake with fear...

69
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:37,858
Her Majesty worries...
She wants her people safe.

70
00:05:37,942 --> 00:05:39,108
So what...?

71
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:40,900
Are you asking me simply
to make sure this cult

72
00:05:40,983 --> 00:05:43,775
is disbanded...
Or is it more...?

73
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:46,525
Do you want them
completely eliminated?

74
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:51,400
That decision is yours...
We leave the choice up to you.

75
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:53,067
All right. Understood.

76
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:58,567
Pluto?

77
00:06:08,983 --> 00:06:10,525
Who exactly was that?

78
00:06:10,608 --> 00:06:12,650
Oh, he's a servant,
nothing more.

79
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:16,442
Is that so...? He seems an
interesting sort of servant.

80
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:24,192
Well... what next?

81
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,025
According to Ashe, the abbey
is heavily guarded...

82
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:30,900
That is something to consider.

83
00:06:30,983 --> 00:06:33,858
So we can't just waltz in
through the front door, then.

84
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:37,608
Incidentally, he did
mention one more thing...

85
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:40,358
Apparently a large number
of coffins have been delivered

86
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,358
there in recent days.

87
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:45,442
Coffins, eh?

88
00:06:51,275 --> 00:06:52,483
I'm coming in.

89
00:06:54,192 --> 00:06:55,942
Welcome, little lord.

90
00:06:56,025 --> 00:06:59,483
Listen up, Undertaker... I
have something to ask of you.

91
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:01,150
In that case....

92
00:07:02,442 --> 00:07:04,525
I demand the very best
loving that Bassy

93
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:06,275
has to offer!

94
00:07:10,317 --> 00:07:11,442
Wait, Grell?!

95
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:13,233
Hello, my lord.

96
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:16,692
What are you doing in there?

97
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:19,442
The bounder told me
he wasn't afraid

98
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:22,442
of grim reapers,
so I buried him in salt.

99
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:25,233
Yes he did!.
All the moisture in body

100
00:07:25,317 --> 00:07:27,900
is being sucked right out
of it as we speak...

101
00:07:27,983 --> 00:07:30,108
It's a great feeling.

102
00:07:30,192 --> 00:07:31,775
An interesting opinion.

103
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:33,775
Tell me, what are you
doing here?!

104
00:07:33,858 --> 00:07:36,525
Will gave me a job
to investigate, that's all.

105
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,608
But I couldn't find
any information...

106
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,942
It was getting late,
and I was tired.

107
00:07:43,025 --> 00:07:45,942
So I laid down
in a field of flowers...

108
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:47,775
The next thing I know,
I'm waking up here

109
00:07:47,858 --> 00:07:49,233
in this shop.

110
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:50,983
I should be careful
in the future not

111
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:52,817
to stop breathing
while I sleep...

112
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,317
but I was waiting
for a certain prince

113
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,525
to come along
and revive me with his kiss.

114
00:07:57,608 --> 00:07:59,400
So, what are you
investigating.

115
00:07:59,483 --> 00:08:00,775
Oh, nothing much...

116
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:03,525
It's the Grim Reapers' store
of Cinematic Records.

117
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,525
Some of them have been stolen.

118
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,317
Cinematic Records?
What're they?

119
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,817
Not something a kid
needs to worry about.

120
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,108
They are reels of film
containing all memories

121
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,775
from someone's lifetime...

122
00:08:14,858 --> 00:08:17,692
Grim Reapers extract
them from the To Die list...

123
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:20,400
Then they decide whether
the person go from there.

124
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:22,442
That's basically it,
though you should be aware

125
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:25,608
that you humans can only
see them when you die.

126
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:27,067
And these records...

127
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,192
How exactly is it that they
were allowed to be stolen?

128
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:32,983
Well, you see... they're
stored in the library when

129
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:35,817
we aren't using them...
Good and evil...

130
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,817
the full past of everyone
who is destined to die...

131
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,192
all of their lives
are stored there

132
00:08:42,275 --> 00:08:44,067
in the form of books.

133
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,358
So you reapers have
a group of books written

134
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:49,192
in preparation for Doomsday?

135
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:51,942
This is something you've
heard of before, isn't it?

136
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:55,067
Undertaker... If you will,

137
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,067
there is something
I need your help with.

138
00:08:58,108 --> 00:08:59,233
Well then...

139
00:08:59,317 --> 00:09:01,608
you do know the price
for that, don't you?

140
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,067
Ah well... on second thought,
I guess I'll do it for free.

141
00:09:13,692 --> 00:09:16,483
I'm here to deliver the
coffins that you ordered.

142
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:20,733
Coffins...?.Are you certain
sir...? I don't believe

143
00:09:20,817 --> 00:09:23,608
I have been informed
about a delivery like that.

144
00:09:23,692 --> 00:09:25,358
I have the order right here.

145
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:29,567
My, oh my, where did I
put it? No. Maybe here?

146
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:37,692
All right then. Perhaps you
should come in, after all...

147
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:40,108
Your friends there
are welcome as well.

148
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:45,150
In that case, I believe I'll
take my leave of you...

149
00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:47,942
I've accomplished
what I came here to do.

150
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:51,900
I understand. Thank you
for all your hard work...

151
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:56,025
I wish you only the best... May
your soul be truly cleansed.

152
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:02,650
Hey... I thought it was
supposed to be difficult

153
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:03,983
to get in here.

154
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:06,900
Yes... That is what
I thought as well.

155
00:10:13,942 --> 00:10:16,733
They have such perfect
smiles... don't they?

156
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,150
Perhaps you should
be learning from them,

157
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:21,067
considering that you've
forgotten how to smile yourself.

158
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,567
Don't be stupid...
Those smiles were fake...

159
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,275
And you know it.

160
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:53,233
What is it my Lord?

161
00:10:54,942 --> 00:10:56,400
Good evening!

162
00:10:56,483 --> 00:10:57,650
Good evening!

163
00:10:57,733 --> 00:11:00,233
Another gorgeous day
today, wasn't it?

164
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:03,525
Aw, well, look... aren't you
just the cutest thing...?

165
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:06,317
I really don't do well
with kids, though.

166
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,817
Hello there unclean one,
I can see every bit

167
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,483
of your impurity.

168
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:11,692
Say what?!

169
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:13,275
What's wrong...?
Is something bothering you,

170
00:11:13,358 --> 00:11:16,692
unclean one...?
Are you not feeling well?

171
00:11:16,775 --> 00:11:18,025
Ya Brat...!

172
00:11:18,108 --> 00:11:19,983
What right do you have
to be calling me unclean?

173
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:22,192
Wah! An unclean one touched me!

174
00:11:22,275 --> 00:11:23,900
We need to go
and be cleansed!

175
00:11:26,275 --> 00:11:27,942
Another unclean one!

176
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:34,900
I'm sorry about that.
After a certain age,

177
00:11:34,983 --> 00:11:37,317
everybody is
considered unclean.

178
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:43,525
I see from your clothing...
you're a new convert...?

179
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:46,067
Don't worry...
If you study the teachings

180
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,317
of our leader,
then you, too,

181
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,233
will be cleansed.

182
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:50,775
What...? How dare you!

183
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:55,358
Unclean...?
What a bizarre thing to say.

184
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:59,233
I can't believe a lady as
beautiful as you is impure.

185
00:12:03,942 --> 00:12:05,733
We really don't know
anything about the religion

186
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:08,567
you practice yet...
Perhaps you would be so kind

187
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,817
as to tell us
a bit more about you?

188
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,608
Yes... but then
what are you doing here?

189
00:12:18,192 --> 00:12:19,692
There was a bug.

190
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,275
Now, you'll tell me
everything I need to know,

191
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:26,275
won't you?

192
00:12:29,358 --> 00:12:32,650
Oh no, stop...!
You'll make me impure!

193
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:35,108
Whatever--do you mean?

194
00:12:37,317 --> 00:12:40,067
I've never known him to use
this approach before.

195
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,400
That's it...!

196
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:43,025
I'm going to put that wench
on the To Die list!

197
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:44,692
She's done!

198
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:45,900
Calm down.

199
00:12:45,983 --> 00:12:49,317
Oh... I can see them...!
I can see the gates

200
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,192
of Heaven now!

201
00:12:51,275 --> 00:12:54,150
I doubt that...
something is fishy here.

202
00:12:56,983 --> 00:12:59,067
The Doomsday Books of those
who live a long life

203
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:03,150
are impure. Our great leader is
trying to cleanse the impure

204
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:06,358
passages... And make them clean
again but that isn't all...

205
00:13:06,442 --> 00:13:09,983
Apparently... the Doomsday
Books contain more than just

206
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:12,358
our past. Our futures
are there as well.

207
00:13:12,442 --> 00:13:14,150
Can you believe that?

208
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:17,108
The future... Interesting...
You don't say.

209
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:19,275
It's true... but only
the chosen children

210
00:13:19,358 --> 00:13:21,900
of the heavenly choir
eligible to hear the words

211
00:13:21,983 --> 00:13:24,317
of the future
written in the books.

212
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,025
What is this
'heavenly choir'...?

213
00:13:26,108 --> 00:13:28,692
Do they all sing
hymns or something?

214
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,442
Well, I... I'm not sure...

215
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:33,567
singing might not be
the right word, exactly.

216
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,608
But I hear beautiful
sounds... They come from

217
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:38,233
our leader's bedroom.

218
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:43,525
If only boys are chosen
for this heavenly choir...

219
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:45,567
that means you're
the only one of us

220
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,817
who can get close
to this priest.

221
00:13:48,775 --> 00:13:51,775
Rubbish! Just look
at this outfit!

222
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:54,942
They'll let me
into the choir for sure.

223
00:13:55,025 --> 00:13:57,567
Well boys?
How do I look?

224
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,358
Wah! He's making me impure!

225
00:14:00,442 --> 00:14:02,067
I hate this guy.

226
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,400
The time has come now
for the cleansing ceremony!

227
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:11,858
Cleansing, eh?

228
00:14:13,608 --> 00:14:17,108
I was right... something
here does smell.

229
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:24,108
And what is it?

230
00:14:24,192 --> 00:14:28,025
Nothing sir. Nothing more
than a rotten apple...

231
00:14:28,108 --> 00:14:30,442
Dead fruit from a fallen tree.

232
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:13,192
Tonight... the unclean
will be made pure again...

233
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:15,442
It is time for the cleansing.

234
00:15:27,108 --> 00:15:29,900
I suppose those books
are cinematic records?

235
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:34,900
I'm too far away to tell.

236
00:15:34,983 --> 00:15:37,650
I shall read the Doomsday
Books of these impure,

237
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:39,525
lost children.

238
00:15:39,608 --> 00:15:42,817
First Jill Fesant...
The second child of a farmer...

239
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,817
She conceived a child in sin.

240
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,567
Then we have
Thomas Atkins...

241
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,067
He has committed no evil
deeds per se but

242
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,442
he has spent his life
meaninglessly...

243
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:54,900
And that is
a grave sin to us.

244
00:16:04,192 --> 00:16:05,317
I say!

245
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:23,275
What's happening?!

246
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:26,525
Snuff out the unclean,
and the unwanted,

247
00:16:26,608 --> 00:16:30,983
and the unnecessary!
Snuff them out! All of them!

248
00:16:45,608 --> 00:16:48,025
And now... despite
what they have done,

249
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,692
these people are
no longer unclean...

250
00:16:50,775 --> 00:16:55,442
Our brother and our sister...
Now as pure as snow!

251
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,983
Our Leader!
Our Leader!

252
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:02,442
What a great blessing this is.

253
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,650
Something's wrong here.

254
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:17,567
Those books that
the Priest had...

255
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,733
They were definatly
not Cinematic Records.

256
00:17:20,817 --> 00:17:22,775
They weren't...? Does that
mean he doesn't have

257
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:25,192
the power to see
the past or future?

258
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:29,817
Ah! you're still here.
I'm so excited!

259
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,233
The heavens have truly
smiled upon you this day!

260
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:38,233
No, stop it...! I can
do it myself, okay?!

261
00:17:38,317 --> 00:17:41,692
Nonsense. You've been chosen
for the heavenly choir,

262
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:43,858
so we have to cleanse
you from head to toe.

263
00:17:43,942 --> 00:17:47,067
Oh my...!
What amazing skin you have!

264
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,483
Don't touch me!

265
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,775
You don't need to worry...

266
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:52,233
We can touch you.
We've already been cleansed.

267
00:17:52,317 --> 00:17:54,275
That isn't my issue!

268
00:17:54,358 --> 00:17:56,150
Pardon me. I can
take care of this.

269
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:57,358
No you can't...

270
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:59,692
You are still unclean.
You can't help here.

271
00:17:59,775 --> 00:18:02,817
My goodness...
You think I'm impure?

272
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,192
Maybe you aren't
unclean after all!

273
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:06,400
No, he is!

274
00:18:08,192 --> 00:18:11,317
Aren't you getting
a little carried away today?

275
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,192
No... I just want to
handle things smoothly.

276
00:18:15,275 --> 00:18:17,775
My lord, I have
no intention of allowing you

277
00:18:17,858 --> 00:18:19,900
to get yourself in danger.

278
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:25,150
I never thought I'd hear you
say that, Sebastian.

279
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:29,817
Quite so, but even if the
Doomsday Books are fakes...

280
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,275
I still believe they hold
some sort of power.

281
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:36,692
Unclean, he said.

282
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:40,317
That's what
the doll called me...

283
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,025
And there's this. This mark.

284
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,108
It's all I have
to cling to now...

285
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:50,608
The only thread the spider
has left me to grab onto...

286
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:52,483
It's my only clue.

287
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:54,525
And by grabbing hold
of that thread...

288
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:56,942
you'll be able to drag
yourself out of hell.

289
00:18:57,025 --> 00:18:59,317
Is that what you truly
believe at this point?

290
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,942
No... I'm not
pulling myself up...

291
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:04,733
I'm dragging them down...
to suffer in this

292
00:19:04,817 --> 00:19:08,650
awful hell with me...
Well that's my plan, anyway.

293
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:12,067
I would expect
nothing less from you.

294
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,942
There's only one thing I want
to hear from you now...

295
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:16,858
and you know it.

296
00:19:16,942 --> 00:19:19,608
"Indeed... my young lord."

297
00:19:32,192 --> 00:19:33,733
Leader... we've brought him.

298
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:38,108
Well done. You may
leave us now.

299
00:19:43,192 --> 00:19:47,108
You look very... clean... Ciel.

300
00:19:47,192 --> 00:19:48,650
Very good. Come this way.

301
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:56,817
Thank you for choosing me.

302
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,692
I... understand
it's quite an honor.

303
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:06,192
Very good.

304
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:08,192
And now there is something
I would like to read to you.

305
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:12,983
May I ask you, what is...
a "Doomsday Book," really?

306
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:15,400
For our purposes...

307
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:18,983
it's a story I'll read to
you for as long as you want.

308
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:21,192
Tonight is a treat, isn't it?

309
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:25,192
Mother said that
since it's my birthday

310
00:20:25,275 --> 00:20:26,733
I can sleep in
the same room with her

311
00:20:26,817 --> 00:20:29,400
and father tonight... and
she's going to read me

312
00:20:29,483 --> 00:20:32,150
as many stories as I want!

313
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:35,317
Tell you what, I'll read to
you until you fall asleep...

314
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,942
Tonight's a treat, isn't it...?
It's your birthday.

315
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:46,442
What the...?

316
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:56,025
That hand... it's his.

317
00:20:56,108 --> 00:20:57,608
Cleanse yourself.

318
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,775
Cleanse yourself of the
sins you've committed...

319
00:21:01,858 --> 00:21:04,108
Right here and right now.

320
00:21:08,983 --> 00:21:12,942
That's right.
It can't be. It can't!

321
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:17,942
Sebastian, this is an
order! Kill this man!

322
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,400
Yes... my young lord.

323
00:21:37,858 --> 00:21:42,817
I thought it was you.
And I was right... Angela.

324
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,817
Uh... Bassy, what the hell's
an angel doing here?

325
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:49,317
Master!

326
00:21:50,983 --> 00:21:54,733
Oh, look...! That's a real
Cinematic Record right there!

327
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,733
Do something, Grell!
Use your death scythe!

328
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:03,233
Give me a second, okay.
I'm working on it!

329
00:22:03,317 --> 00:22:04,858
What are those sad things?

330
00:22:04,942 --> 00:22:07,192
Well, what do you want
me to do...?!

331
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:10,775
Will just took my other
death scythe away from me!

332
00:22:10,858 --> 00:22:14,983
I will show all of it to you...
all the light and darkness

333
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,358
Every moment in your past.

334
00:22:19,525 --> 00:22:20,983
Master!

335
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:25,275
I cut it!

336
00:22:25,358 --> 00:22:26,733
Here we go!

337
00:24:10,775 --> 00:24:13,525
Master, you must do
your best not to look

338
00:24:13,608 --> 00:24:15,275
into the past.

339
00:24:15,358 --> 00:24:18,900
I know it's call is sweet
and it's lure addictive.

340
00:24:18,983 --> 00:24:20,817
To avoid is to avoid
a part of yourself

341
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,983
that you may feel
that you're missing.

342
00:24:23,067 --> 00:24:26,025
But you are fragile yet
and dipping even one toe

343
00:24:26,108 --> 00:24:29,358
into that pool of nostalgia
could mean drowning...

344
00:24:29,442 --> 00:24:31,317
you must see it.

345
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,567
Next time, on Black Butler...
"His Butler, Transmitted."

346
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,317
You see... I am simply
one hell of a butler.
