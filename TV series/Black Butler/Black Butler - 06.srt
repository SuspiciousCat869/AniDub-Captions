1
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,942
The murderer's distinctive
style of killing

2
00:00:16,025 --> 00:00:17,317
has earned him
a unique nickname

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,400
from the press.
"Jack the Ripper."

4
00:00:23,483 --> 00:00:27,775
Yes... the uterus is missing...
which is quite... odd.

5
00:00:27,858 --> 00:00:30,733
Exactly... none of the people
in his mansion

6
00:00:30,817 --> 00:00:32,275
could have done it either.

7
00:00:32,358 --> 00:00:35,108
Sebastian! You didn't...

8
00:00:35,192 --> 00:00:36,858
In the end, you two
were the only ones

9
00:00:36,942 --> 00:00:39,067
who could be Jack the Ripper.

10
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,025
...You, Madam Red...
and Grell Sutcliffe.

11
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:43,733
You brat...

12
00:00:45,442 --> 00:00:48,608
You shouldn't have been born
in the first place!

13
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,025
I can't kill him...

14
00:00:56,108 --> 00:00:58,650
I can't kill
their beloved son.

15
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:01,608
Too late for that...!
How disappointing.

16
00:01:01,692 --> 00:01:04,817
What use do I have for you
if you're just another woman?!

17
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,733
Here we are.
A demon... And a reaper.

18
00:01:37,192 --> 00:01:39,942
I suppose we'll
never resolve this.

19
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:42,358
These feelings that we have
are forbidden...

20
00:01:42,442 --> 00:01:45,858
Oh, my! It's just like
Romeo and Juliet!

21
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,608
O my dear Bassy,
Wherefore art thou,

22
00:01:51,692 --> 00:01:53,567
my sweet love, Bassy?!

23
00:01:58,233 --> 00:02:01,067
If you would deny thy master
and refuse thy name...

24
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,650
I know that we could be
happy together.

25
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:07,067
The moment my master
uttered my new name,

26
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,400
that word became
our solemn contract...

27
00:02:09,483 --> 00:02:13,108
I was rebaptized as his...
and his alone...

28
00:02:13,192 --> 00:02:15,775
From that day,
I have been "Sebastian."...

29
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:18,442
By yonder moon, I swear it.

30
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:21,567
To swear by something
as inconstant as the moon...

31
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,275
How can I believe your words?

32
00:02:23,358 --> 00:02:25,567
Yet I see your eyes
and know that they do

33
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,900
what your lips
and hands long to do.

34
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:31,942
You caress me softly with your
unworthy, devilish gaze.

35
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:33,900
Oooh!

36
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:35,358
It's almost too much, Bassy...!

37
00:02:35,442 --> 00:02:38,233
I would bear your children
if you'd only let me!

38
00:02:38,317 --> 00:02:40,733
Please stop that...
It is revolting.

39
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:43,567
Oh... you treat me so coldly.

40
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:50,900
Beautiful tyrant!
Fiend angelical!

41
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:54,442
My dove-feather'd raven!

42
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:59,733
Oh, Bassy! Bassy... my love...

43
00:02:59,817 --> 00:03:02,358
If only cruel morning
would never come...

44
00:03:02,442 --> 00:03:04,442
Then the two of us might
go on like this forever,

45
00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:08,817
our love permanently lit
by the moon's seductive glow.

46
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,858
But no...

47
00:03:09,942 --> 00:03:11,942
I'm afraid our
adventure ends here.

48
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:16,817
Shall we part with
a passionate kiss...?

49
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,525
No? Then good night, my love.
A thousand times, good night!

50
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,733
There now...!
Surely your Cinematic Record

51
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:31,692
will be be far more
interesting than any human's!

52
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:22,733
No...! No no no
no no no no...!

53
00:05:22,817 --> 00:05:25,650
Who are these people?
What the hell is this?!

54
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:32,525
That's what my life has been for
the past two years, after all.

55
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:35,317
I'm not interested
in seeing your daily chores!

56
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,442
I know all that! Come on,
show me the good stuff!

57
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:41,108
So sorry...

58
00:05:41,192 --> 00:05:43,775
I'm afraid I charge
for the juicy bits.

59
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:45,317
Skinflint!

60
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,775
Look at that.
My clothes are ruined again...

61
00:05:52,858 --> 00:05:54,608
This is past mending.

62
00:05:55,817 --> 00:05:58,275
You must be pretty confident
to worry about your clothes

63
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,317
right now... But of course...

64
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,192
You know, I always appreciate
a sharp looking man...

65
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:04,817
Well done, Bassy.

66
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:11,108
There was one technique that I
absolutely did not want to use.

67
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:14,317
but I have no other choice.

68
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,150
So at last you're going
to fight me seriously?

69
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:21,400
Shall we send the curtain down
with the next blow...?

70
00:06:21,483 --> 00:06:25,358
I'll miss you terribly,
but perhaps we'll meet again...

71
00:06:25,442 --> 00:06:27,025
Farewell!

72
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,650
What the hell?!

73
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,483
That was my finest tailcoat.

74
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:51,483
It was made of the
highest quality Yorkshire wool.

75
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:53,650
Wool is a very tricky fabric...

76
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:55,317
Once it becomes
caught in something,

77
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,108
it is exceedingly
difficult to remove.

78
00:06:57,192 --> 00:06:59,775
How could you do this to me?!

79
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,650
I acquired that coat at
the manor and I certainly

80
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:06,358
didn't want to use it
for something like this...

81
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:11,192
But...you had already
ruined it, after all.

82
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:12,483
So then...

83
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:15,317
Fistacuffs yes...?
That suits me quite well...

84
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,733
I do have some
expertise in that area.

85
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:20,400
No...! Please,
just one request...!

86
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,400
Not... my face!

87
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,858
I said no face!

88
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:40,775
Please... just stop!

89
00:07:46,942 --> 00:07:48,108
I'm sorry...

90
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:51,108
I seem to have misjudged
the distance, my lord.

91
00:07:51,192 --> 00:07:52,775
You look terrible pretty awful.

92
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:55,358
He caused me a little bit
of trouble actually.

93
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:58,108
I'll...show you someday.

94
00:07:58,192 --> 00:08:00,233
Oh, dear...

95
00:08:00,317 --> 00:08:03,775
I suppose one can't kill
a reaper with bare fists alone.

96
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,067
Well then...
I'll just try this...

97
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,525
His very special reaper scythe.

98
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
There... that's unstuck...

99
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:15,817
now it should
cut right through you.

100
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,150
What... what are you doing?
No don't...! No... no--!

101
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:22,692
I must say, this is much
nicer. I prefer kicking

102
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:24,442
to being kicked.

103
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:25,900
That hurts!

104
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:29,942
Master... He's revolting,
but still a divine being...

105
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:32,858
Are you prepared to accept
whatever consequences come

106
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:34,150
of killing him?

107
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:37,483
Sebastian, do you need me
to repeat my order?

108
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:39,067
No, sir.

109
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:43,025
We've finally found
something you're good at:

110
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:44,108
screaming...

111
00:08:44,192 --> 00:08:47,442
Very well done...
And, as a reward,

112
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:50,192
I shall kill you with
this cherished toy of yours.

113
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:52,858
No, please stop...!
Don't kill me!

114
00:08:52,942 --> 00:08:54,150
So sorry.

115
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,817
I can tell you who killed
the kid's parents!

116
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:13,525
I apologize for interrupting.
Let me introduce myself.

117
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:15,733
I am William T. Spears,
an administrator

118
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:18,358
at the Grim Reaper
Staffing Association.

119
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:22,275
I've come to retrieve
that reaper there.

120
00:09:22,358 --> 00:09:24,483
William...! Oh, William!

121
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,150
Did you come to save me--

122
00:09:29,983 --> 00:09:32,233
Attention,
reaper Grell Sutcliffe...

123
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:34,817
You have violated
several regulations.

124
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,900
First... you killed people
not on the To-Die list...

125
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:40,525
Second, you used a death scythe
that had been modified

126
00:09:40,608 --> 00:09:42,275
without authorization...

127
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:43,900
And finally ,
you offered someone

128
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,608
strictly classified information
regarding the identity

129
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:49,692
of his relatives' murderer.

130
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:53,400
I apologize for
all of the trouble

131
00:09:53,483 --> 00:09:54,900
this wretch has caused.

132
00:09:54,983 --> 00:09:57,192
Here, please accept my card.

133
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:02,317
Honestly... I never
thought I'd see the day

134
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,650
when I had to bow my head
to demon scum like you.

135
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:08,525
This is a disgrace
to all grim reapers.

136
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,025
Then perhaps you should keep a
better eye on your minions...

137
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:14,067
so they don't trouble us.

138
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,400
Humans are so easily tempted...

139
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:20,358
They will do anything when
in the grip of utter despair...

140
00:10:20,442 --> 00:10:22,358
They will grasp at
any thread that promises

141
00:10:22,442 --> 00:10:26,983
to save them from unhappiness...
No matter the consequences.

142
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:28,733
You should know that.

143
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,567
That's a charming bit
of hypocrisy.

144
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:35,775
You demons capitalize on that
quality more often than we do.

145
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:37,358
That I cannot deny.

146
00:10:37,442 --> 00:10:39,525
Right now you seem
to be a tame dog...

147
00:10:39,608 --> 00:10:40,942
That makes you
far less dangerous

148
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:43,983
than the rabid mongrels
running around free.

149
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:47,275
Now... come with me,
Grell. We're leaving.

150
00:10:48,442 --> 00:10:50,608
We're already short-handed,
and here you've gone

151
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,733
and landed me
with even more overtime.

152
00:10:53,817 --> 00:10:56,400
The Board is not
going to be pleased...

153
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,400
I assume you'll
want that, yes?

154
00:11:04,483 --> 00:11:06,192
Yes, thank you.

155
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:12,900
Now, if you'll
please excuse us.

156
00:11:20,858 --> 00:11:22,608
I'm sorry, my lord...

157
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:25,233
I allowed half of
Jack the Ripper to escape.

158
00:11:27,942 --> 00:11:31,983
It's all right...
it's... done.

159
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:36,108
You're chilled
to the bone, master...

160
00:11:36,192 --> 00:11:38,317
Let's hurry back
to the house now...

161
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,608
I'll make some hot tea
to warm you up.

162
00:11:41,358 --> 00:11:43,067
That's a good idea.

163
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,692
Sir!

164
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:51,442
But master...?

165
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:54,983
No! Stay back...
I can stand on my own.

166
00:11:57,733 --> 00:12:02,317
I'm fine... Just a little
tired... that's all.

167
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:24,317
Hey, look... The church
is really crowded today.

168
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,275
I wonder why?

169
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:26,233
Don't know.

170
00:12:26,317 --> 00:12:27,775
But you're older than us.

171
00:12:27,858 --> 00:12:29,192
Doesn't that mean
you should know?

172
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:30,942
You're stupid!

173
00:12:31,025 --> 00:12:32,525
'ey, I'm still only twelve!

174
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:34,858
It's not like I'm supposed
to know everything yet!

175
00:12:34,942 --> 00:12:36,942
You have a point.

176
00:12:37,025 --> 00:12:38,733
At only twelve,
it would be a shame

177
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:40,650
if you did understand
what's happening...

178
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:42,108
Let me explain it...

179
00:12:42,192 --> 00:12:45,275
Today is a special
noblewoman's big day.

180
00:12:45,358 --> 00:12:47,275
What do you mean, mister?

181
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:52,608
Well... it's the ultimate
ceremony of any person's life.

182
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:54,817
The funeral.

183
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,692
She has departed
from us now,

184
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:59,150
as all mankind
must the earth,

185
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:03,483
as someday we all must....
Her flesh shall turn to ashes,

186
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:05,817
but her spirit will remains
with the lord....

187
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,692
Goodbye Auntie An...

188
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:20,150
You're here!

189
00:13:23,608 --> 00:13:25,317
Is that the Phantomhive boy?

190
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,150
With a scarlet dress?!

191
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:28,733
How inappropriate!

192
00:13:28,817 --> 00:13:32,483
Not so. Think of how
she loved the color red.

193
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:50,858
White flowers and plain dresses
didn't suit you in life,

194
00:13:50,942 --> 00:13:55,775
and they don't now.
You belong in red...

195
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:59,650
the color of passion...
the color of spider lilies.

196
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:03,358
Farewell, Aunt An.

197
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:26,775
London bridge is falling
down, my fair lady

198
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:33,692
London bridge is falling down,
falling down, falling down,

199
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:40,358
London bridge is falling
down, my fair lady

200
00:14:40,442 --> 00:14:47,150
London bridge is falling down,
falling down, falling down,

201
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:53,817
London bridge is falling
down, my fair lady

202
00:14:53,900 --> 00:15:00,275
London bridge is falling down,
falling down, falling down,

203
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:06,525
London bridge is falling
down, my fair lady...

204
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:17,067
Rest peacefully...
Madame Red.

205
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,317
The funeral must be
going on right now.

206
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,275
Madam Red won't be coming
to visit anymore...

207
00:15:31,358 --> 00:15:33,358
It'll be so quiet here.

208
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:36,442
Everyone, we need to
get it together...

209
00:15:36,525 --> 00:15:38,067
A time like this
is when the young master

210
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,483
needs us the most,
you know.

211
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:40,442
--Yes, you're right!
--You bet!

212
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:42,442
Ho ho ho

213
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,483
So you've left us,
my lady...

214
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:50,400
You'll be with
your loved ones again now...

215
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,733
May you find peace.

216
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,317
What're you still doing here?
The investigation is over.

217
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,067
Are we sure?
How can we be certain...?

218
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,067
The circumstances are all
so shadowy.

219
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,442
I feel it's our duty
to investigate further.

220
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:11,942
Our country has
a long and rich history...

221
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:14,442
and with it comes a certain
number of secrets...

222
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:17,817
secrets from which I would
advise you to stay away.

223
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,483
It has been decided, boy.

224
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:21,192
This case is part of
the underworld,

225
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:23,525
and it will be solved
in the underworld.

226
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,567
Decided...? But by whom?

227
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,692
If you want to know,
get yourself promoted...

228
00:16:27,775 --> 00:16:30,192
but I guarantee
you'll regret finding out.

229
00:16:30,275 --> 00:16:32,150
Some rocks are
better left unturned.

230
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:35,067
Trust me on this, Abberline.

231
00:16:36,775 --> 00:16:38,900
You're not going
to report the true identity

232
00:16:38,983 --> 00:16:40,358
of Jack the Ripper
to the Queen?

233
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:42,608
I don't think it necessary...

234
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:45,817
She simply instructed me
to stop the incidents...

235
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,858
And now I have seen to that.

236
00:16:47,942 --> 00:16:50,067
Your world is full
of quicksand...

237
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,067
and you keep letting yourself
sink further and further in.

238
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,817
But even if you reach
the point of no return...

239
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,275
and all looks lost...

240
00:16:57,358 --> 00:16:59,108
you'll still never
call out for help.

241
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:00,983
No, none of us will hear
Lord Phantomhive's

242
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:03,067
pathetic screams.

243
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,275
The Queen's guard dog
is too proud for that.

244
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,317
Which makes you
a formidable opponent.

245
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,900
I'll have to be
careful around you.

246
00:17:09,983 --> 00:17:12,275
Now that you mention it,
opium dens are beginning

247
00:17:12,358 --> 00:17:13,858
to become a problem...

248
00:17:13,942 --> 00:17:15,983
If you want to get out,
now's the time.

249
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:18,858
If I did that, I'd have to think
of another business to run,

250
00:17:18,942 --> 00:17:21,608
and that sounds like
more trouble than it's worth.

251
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:22,858
Well...

252
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,983
You could always go back
to your home country.

253
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:27,108
Oh, but I haven't
exhausted my interest

254
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:28,942
in this country quite yet.

255
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:32,775
Or, for that matter,...
in you, my lord.

256
00:17:32,858 --> 00:17:36,317
I fully expect more interesting
challenges from you.

257
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:41,733
We have somewhere
to go... Come.

258
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:45,233
This is her?

259
00:17:45,317 --> 00:17:48,942
Yes, indeed it is... My last
customer from Jack the Ripper.

260
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:50,900
Apparently she
was an immigrant...

261
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:54,317
She had no family in the
country to claim her body.

262
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,692
So our kindhearted earl here
hired me to pretty her up.

263
00:17:57,775 --> 00:18:00,567
Even had this gravestone
erected. A truly noble act

264
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,275
on his part, eh?

265
00:18:02,358 --> 00:18:04,192
This isn't noble at all.

266
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:06,942
The noble thing to do would
have been to save her...

267
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:10,442
And... I could have,
If I put her life first.

268
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:12,983
But no... I had to
catch them...

269
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:16,317
Apprehending Jack the Ripper
was more important.

270
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,108
I knew they intended
to kill her.

271
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:24,608
I knew...and I let her die...
along with my aunt.

272
00:18:24,692 --> 00:18:26,733
You regret what you did,
my lord?

273
00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:30,442
No, I don't.... Jack the
Ripper is gone forever...

274
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:33,275
and I've done exactly
as her majesty asked of me.

275
00:18:33,358 --> 00:18:36,275
Victoria, eh?
I don't much like her.

276
00:18:36,358 --> 00:18:39,233
She just sits back and
watches while you do all

277
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:42,442
her dirty work for her...
It doesn't seem fair to me.

278
00:18:42,525 --> 00:18:45,358
That's what the Phantomhives
do. It's our duty...

279
00:18:45,442 --> 00:18:48,442
Passed down through generations
along with this ring.

280
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:51,817
That ring reminds me of a collar
a master puts on her dog...

281
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,442
You're forever tied to the queen
by the leash of duty.

282
00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:56,900
I chose this life... Stop!

283
00:18:56,983 --> 00:18:59,775
Lord Phantomhive... You
should be wary of the path

284
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:03,358
down which duty will take you.
That collar may choke you yet.

285
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,900
And we wouldn't
want that now, would we...?

286
00:19:05,983 --> 00:19:09,317
Do come by if you should need
my assistance again.

287
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,483
You and that hilarious butler
of yours are always welcome.

288
00:19:21,317 --> 00:19:22,900
It was noble.

289
00:19:22,983 --> 00:19:26,400
Don't make me repeat myself...
What I did wasn't noble.

290
00:19:26,483 --> 00:19:29,483
I thought it was.
But if you think not...

291
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:32,275
Then maybe...
it was weakness.

292
00:19:32,358 --> 00:19:33,275
What?!

293
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:35,692
Tell me...
Why didn't you kill her?

294
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,900
Your own aunt
was threatening you...

295
00:19:37,983 --> 00:19:41,275
It seemed like she
was going to take your life.

296
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:43,275
You could have stopped her...
You could have

297
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:45,817
defended yourself
if you wanted to...

298
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,692
But you wavered... Even then...
you refused to draw your gun.

299
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:55,900
Why, master...? Were you afraid
of killing Madam Red...

300
00:19:55,983 --> 00:19:59,192
with your own hands?
Would it have been easier

301
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:01,692
if she was a stranger
instead of someone who

302
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:03,442
was your own flesh and blood?

303
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,483
I held back because
it was your job.

304
00:20:10,775 --> 00:20:12,900
I knew that you would
protect me even at the cost

305
00:20:12,983 --> 00:20:16,442
of your own life... That's why
I didn't draw my gun on her...

306
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:18,442
Our contract demands
that you serve me...

307
00:20:18,525 --> 00:20:20,233
and that you protect me
with your very life ...

308
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:21,858
until I achieve my goal.

309
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:25,733
Until that time I'll not worry
for my safety... I imagine

310
00:20:25,817 --> 00:20:28,775
you demons know nothing
of principles or loyalty...

311
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:30,942
but you do know about deals,..

312
00:20:31,025 --> 00:20:33,692
And so, because of the deal we
have made... you'll protect me,

313
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,692
no matter the circumstance...
Am I wrong?

314
00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:37,942
Of course not.

315
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:39,858
But you stopped me
from killing her as well.

316
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:45,317
When she moved to kill me, there
was hesitation in her eyes.

317
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:51,192
I didn't think she'd be able to
do it, not to me, her kin,

318
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:56,192
her sister's son. One wrong
move can cost you your life...

319
00:20:56,275 --> 00:20:57,942
just like chess.

320
00:20:58,025 --> 00:21:01,608
She hesitated and lost sight
of her next move...

321
00:21:01,692 --> 00:21:03,525
That's all there is to it.

322
00:21:07,775 --> 00:21:10,358
That's why I don't hesitate.

323
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,983
Now that's what
I expect to hear...

324
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:21,525
Always skillfully
manipulate your pieces...

325
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:26,900
That's how you survive.
Use me... and Madam Red...

326
00:21:26,983 --> 00:21:28,608
and any piece
within your reach.

327
00:21:28,692 --> 00:21:30,233
Even if the bodies
of your pawns

328
00:21:30,317 --> 00:21:32,275
pile up at the foot
of your throne...

329
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:36,858
Because if the king falls...
this game is over.

330
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:41,525
I won't hesitate... I won't
regret the moves I've made.

331
00:21:41,608 --> 00:21:45,275
Sebastian... You... you
you're the one person

332
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:46,817
who can never betray me...

333
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:52,775
And you can never leave
my side. That's an order.

334
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:00,192
Yes ...my young lord.

335
00:22:01,442 --> 00:22:06,192
I will be there... Anywhere
you wish me to follow.

336
00:22:12,275 --> 00:22:17,108
Even if your throne crumbles...
your brilliant crown rusts...

337
00:22:17,192 --> 00:22:20,233
And a mountain of bodies
piles at your feet...

338
00:22:20,317 --> 00:22:22,817
I will stay beside you...

339
00:22:25,775 --> 00:22:30,150
We will sit side by side
atop your fallen pawns.

340
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:35,108
Until the last bell tolls...
I will be there.

341
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,483
My young master has been
ordered to develop a certain

342
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:16,775
village into a recreational
estate for the queen.

343
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:19,692
What a petty task...

344
00:24:19,775 --> 00:24:22,483
Maybe there's something to that
revolting nickname of his.

345
00:24:22,567 --> 00:24:25,483
The Queen's guard dog...!
Perhaps it's truer

346
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:26,733
than I thought.

347
00:24:26,817 --> 00:24:30,567
Wag your tail...!
Fetch...! Good boy!

348
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:33,567
Next time, on Black Butler...

349
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,817
"His Butler, Merrymaking."

350
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,150
You see... I am simply
one hell of a butler.
