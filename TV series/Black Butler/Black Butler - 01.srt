1
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,275
Think carefully... Should you
reject the faith even this

2
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:26,358
once, the gates of Paradise will
forever be out of your reach.

3
00:00:26,442 --> 00:00:30,067
Do you think...one who
was among the faithful...

4
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,858
would ever go so far as to
summon someone like you?

5
00:00:32,942 --> 00:00:40,442
I'll ask but once more... Do you
wish to form a contract with me?

6
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:44,192
I do...! Now, stop asking
these tedious questions,

7
00:00:44,275 --> 00:00:46,358
and let me know
if we have a deal!

8
00:02:44,483 --> 00:02:47,525
Master... It is time
for you to wake up.

9
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,567
For breakfast today, we have
a lightly poached salmon

10
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,858
accompanied by a delicate
mint salad. I can also offer

11
00:03:02,942 --> 00:03:06,025
toast, scones,
or pan de com pahn yah...

12
00:03:06,108 --> 00:03:09,025
Which dish would you
care for this morning?

13
00:03:09,108 --> 00:03:10,567
A scone.

14
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,942
Today you have a meeting with
Mr. Hughes, the authority on

15
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:15,900
the history of the Roman
Empire... and this evening,

16
00:03:15,983 --> 00:03:17,525
Mr. Damiano of
the Poseidon Company

17
00:03:17,608 --> 00:03:19,233
will be paying you a visit.

18
00:03:19,317 --> 00:03:22,150
Oh... Is that the man I have
in charge of stuffed animals

19
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,817
at my factory in India?

20
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,442
Yes. I'm told he's Italian...
We will, of course,

21
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:32,442
offer him all the hospitality
the estate can provide.

22
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:35,692
I know this smell...
Is this tea Earl Grey?

23
00:03:35,775 --> 00:03:38,233
Yes... from Jackson's
of Piccadilly.

24
00:03:39,483 --> 00:03:41,983
I shall wait for you
at the dining table, master.

25
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:57,942
Well thrown, my lord. Even so...
let's save the games for later.

26
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:03,650
Yes... I suppose
you're right, Sebastian.

27
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:09,858
My butler is an able man.

28
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,525
Ow, ow, ow, ow! What was that
for, Master...? What did I do?

29
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:24,317
Nothing... I don't need
to justify my actions.

30
00:04:25,692 --> 00:04:30,150
There you are. Have you finished
weeding the courtyard, Finny?

31
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:32,275
Mey Rin... have you
washed all the bedding?

32
00:04:32,358 --> 00:04:34,608
Um, well...

33
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:39,108
Bardroy... shouldn't you be
preparing for tonight's dinner?

34
00:04:39,192 --> 00:04:40,483
Mr. Tanaka...

35
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:44,400
Well... I suppose
you're all right as you are.

36
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:50,150
Now all of you...We have
no time for thumb twiddling

37
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:53,525
this morning...
So get to work!

38
00:04:56,358 --> 00:04:58,233
Yes, Sir!

39
00:04:58,317 --> 00:04:59,650
Simply hopeless.

40
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:23,775
The silver is polished
to a spotless shine.

41
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:28,275
The tablecloth is crisp,
clean, and wrinkle free...

42
00:05:28,358 --> 00:05:31,025
There is not a single bruised
blossom among Master's

43
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:35,442
favorite white
roses. And finally,

44
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:38,275
the highest quality ingredients
have been gathered to prepare

45
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:40,233
a first-rate dinner.

46
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,275
The table is perfection...

47
00:05:44,358 --> 00:05:46,900
This will be an elegant
Phantomhive welcome.

48
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:54,067
Still so much to do,
and he calls me now?

49
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,442
A guest is comin'? All right,
then this is our chance...

50
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,108
Sebastian looks
down on us all the time...

51
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:02,942
today we'll be so perfect,
he won't even know

52
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:07,358
what hit him. Yeah,
that's what he's gonna say!

53
00:06:07,442 --> 00:06:08,358
AAAH!

54
00:06:08,442 --> 00:06:10,567
That's for him to say, not you.

55
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,608
Ooh! That's a good idea!

56
00:06:12,692 --> 00:06:15,692
Right, we have to stop relyin'
on Sebastian for everything.

57
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,275
It's settled, then.
We got a plan of attack!

58
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:19,983
Let's get to it!

59
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,817
I'm a bit hungry... I'd like
something sweet to eat.

60
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,400
You shouldn't eat now, Master...
You don't want to spoil

61
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:29,483
your appetite for dinner
with your guest this evening.

62
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:32,400
I don't care about that...
Make me a parfait.

63
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:34,483
I'm sorry, sir.

64
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:37,775
Fine then... about the portrait
in the hallway...

65
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:38,692
Yes?

66
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:39,983
Take it down.

67
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:44,233
I am Ciel Phantomhive,
son of Vincent

68
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,275
and I am the head
of the house now.

69
00:06:52,442 --> 00:06:54,858
Consider it done, my lord.

70
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:56,317
Now...

71
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,900
How exactly... Did
this... Happen?

72
00:07:00,983 --> 00:07:02,692
I thought things
would go faster if I used

73
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:05,192
extra-strength weed-killer
on the garden!

74
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:07,442
I was trying to reach
the tea set we use for guests,

75
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:10,025
but I tripped
and the cabinet fell!

76
00:07:10,108 --> 00:07:11,775
There was a lot of meat
to be cooked for dinner,

77
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:13,983
and it was going
to take a long time...

78
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,817
so, uh, I used
me flame thrower.

79
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:22,317
We're so sorry!
We didn't mean to!

80
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,942
Our guest will arrive just
after six. At most, we have

81
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:30,900
two hours left. Not enough time
to replace the tea set

82
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:35,900
or find premium meats.
What should I do?

83
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:38,317
Calm down, all of you.
Perhaps you should try taking

84
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,400
a page out of Tanaka's book
and start behaving like--

85
00:07:45,817 --> 00:07:48,442
Everyone... listen closely
and do exactly as I say,

86
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:50,608
understand?
We must be quick about this.

87
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,692
We might save this night yet.

88
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,817
How impressive!

89
00:08:12,108 --> 00:08:13,733
Hello. Welcome, sir.

90
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:15,775
This is called
a stone garden...

91
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:17,858
It is a traditional
feature in Japan.

92
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:23,608
Ah, prodigioso...! Wonderful.
Truly, an elegant garden.

93
00:08:23,692 --> 00:08:25,275
We thought it appropriate
to serve dinner

94
00:08:25,358 --> 00:08:27,608
al fresco this evening...

95
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:30,858
Allow me to escort you inside
until the meal is ready.

96
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:35,942
I should have expected
this from a Phantomhive.

97
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:38,400
I cannot wait to see
what else is in store.

98
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,608
Whew, we actually did it!

99
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,483
Who would have thought
a dozen bags of gravel

100
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:50,108
could turn into an
amazing garden?!

101
00:08:50,192 --> 00:08:52,567
Naturally we were able
to handle this...

102
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,567
We serve the Phantomhive family,
after all. There's still

103
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,942
work to be done... Let's take
care of it while the master

104
00:08:58,025 --> 00:09:01,150
is talking business with
his guest... Look sharp, now.

105
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:02,358
Right!

106
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:09,400
The progress we've been making
with the East India factory

107
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,150
is quite astonishing...

108
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:13,900
We already have the makings
of a top-notch staff.

109
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:17,483
"Bewitched by the eyes of the
dead." What terrible luck...

110
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,608
It appears I lose a turn.

111
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,900
Right now is the perfect time...
We should begin expanding

112
00:09:22,983 --> 00:09:25,400
the company and building
a strong labor f--

113
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:27,483
Go on. It's your turn.

114
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,900
Oh, yes... I just
spin this, then?

115
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:38,942
Okay, there. Five spaces...
Now, what I wanted to ask you...

116
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:42,442
Perhaps you could contribute
another 12,000 pounds

117
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:45,400
to support our expansion?
I believe it would be

118
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:47,983
quite a profitable venture
for you, my lord...

119
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:50,608
and I would consider it
an honor to help expand

120
00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:51,692
the Funtom Company into--

121
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:53,692
"Lose a leg in the
enchanted forest."

122
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:55,067
Huh?

123
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,358
And it's your turn again...
I lost a turn, remember?

124
00:09:58,442 --> 00:10:01,192
Oh... I see...

125
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:06,733
Right... I move six.

126
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:08,858
You don't... That's three.

127
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,567
What? But...

128
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,400
You lost a leg,
if you'll recall.

129
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:15,817
Now you only move
half the number of spaces.

130
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,650
Oh my... This is a gruesome
board game, isn't it...?

131
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:23,108
Is there no way for me
to restore my leg, then?

132
00:10:23,192 --> 00:10:26,108
I'm afraid once something
is truly lost, sir...

133
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,275
That one can never
get it back again.

134
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:35,817
"Your body is burnt
by raging flames."

135
00:10:55,483 --> 00:10:56,900
How is it going?

136
00:10:56,983 --> 00:11:00,400
I'm doin' it like you said to...
This really what you want?

137
00:11:00,483 --> 00:11:02,442
Yes... that looks excellent.

138
00:11:02,525 --> 00:11:06,400
Sebastian! Found em!

139
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,900
Oh, honestly... How many
times have I told you

140
00:11:15,983 --> 00:11:18,108
not to run inside
the manor, Mey Rin?

141
00:11:18,192 --> 00:11:20,983
I'm so sorry, sir...!
My glasses cracked,

142
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:23,858
and I can't see a thing!

143
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:28,192
These are the last items
we needed for dinner.

144
00:11:28,275 --> 00:11:29,525
Splendid work, everyone...
And now, I believe you can

145
00:11:29,608 --> 00:11:31,150
leave the rest of it to me
and relax for a bit...

146
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:35,650
But I need you to do well--Very
well--during dinner tonight.

147
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:37,233
He said it twice.

148
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:39,400
Ooo, that's serious.

149
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:45,358
Pardon the interruption,
but dinner is served.

150
00:11:45,442 --> 00:11:48,858
Ooh... dining out in that
exquisite stone garden...

151
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:50,442
Shall we go, my lord?

152
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:52,608
Very well.
We'll finish the game later

153
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:55,358
Oh... Is there any
real need to finish it?

154
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:57,442
It's obvious I'm going to lose.

155
00:11:57,525 --> 00:11:59,442
I'm not in the habit
of abandoning games

156
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:01,025
halfway through.

157
00:12:02,275 --> 00:12:03,942
How childish.

158
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:06,483
Uh...I...I mean,

159
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:08,358
sometimes it takes
a child's eyes to see

160
00:12:08,442 --> 00:12:11,358
what's really important
...It's a true gift.

161
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:12,858
Maybe that's what's made
the Phantomhives

162
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:16,983
the nation's foremost toymakers.
It certainly impresses me.

163
00:12:19,692 --> 00:12:23,275
On tonight's menu is a dish of
finely sliced raw beef donburi,

164
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:25,567
courtesy of our chef, Bardroy.

165
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,733
"Don"...?

166
00:12:30,525 --> 00:12:34,108
A pile of raw beef...
and this is dinner?

167
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:37,567
Yes. But surely
you have heard of it...?

168
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,483
This, good sir, is a
traditional Japanese delicacy,

169
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:42,692
a dish offered as a sign of
gratitude to someone who

170
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:45,942
has accomplished important
work... That, sir...

171
00:12:46,025 --> 00:12:48,775
is the wonder of donburi!

172
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:50,858
Oh, donburi!

173
00:12:50,942 --> 00:12:53,400
This is a token from our
master... to show his thanks

174
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:55,858
for all of your hard work
on the company's behalf...

175
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,025
He wanted you to know that
it's much appreciated.

176
00:12:58,108 --> 00:13:00,192
Now that's our Sebastian,
for you!

177
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:01,900
He saved the day!

178
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:06,608
Excellent! What an inspired
idea! The legendary

179
00:13:06,692 --> 00:13:09,067
Phantomhive hospitality
in action.

180
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,567
The vintage we are pouring
tonight was specially selected

181
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:18,858
to complement the flavor of soy
sauce...Mey Rin...Now, Mey Rin.

182
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:21,108
Why are you just
standing there...?

183
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:22,483
Pour the man a glass of wine.

184
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,442
Of course, yes sir!

185
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:29,358
'ey...Is it just me, or is
Mey Rin acting a little strange?

186
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,150
Sebastian's watching me...
I can't take it.

187
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:35,483
Don't look at me that way!

188
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:43,150
Mei Rin, stop it...! Can't you
see you're spilling the wine!?

189
00:14:08,233 --> 00:14:11,275
Huh...? Where did
the tablecloth go?

190
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:13,775
A speck of dirt...
most unsightly...

191
00:14:13,858 --> 00:14:16,275
I had the cloth removed
so it wouldn't distract us...

192
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:17,817
Think nothing of it.

193
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,858
Please accept my apologies,
sir... Do continue...

194
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:22,650
Enjoy the meal
at your leisure.

195
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:26,358
Oh...oh my!
Lord Phantomhive,

196
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:28,400
once again you have
truly impressed me.

197
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:30,775
What an able butler
you've acquired.

198
00:14:30,858 --> 00:14:35,233
Pay him no mind. He merely acted
as befits one of my servants.

199
00:14:35,317 --> 00:14:38,858
My master is quite correct
about that... Naturally.

200
00:14:38,942 --> 00:14:41,567
You see, I am simply
one hell of a butler.

201
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:47,983
That was a thoroughly enjoyable
dinner, my lord. Now then...

202
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:49,317
about the contract.

203
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,817
Before we discuss that,
we must finish the game.

204
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,775
Yes, of course... I do have
a pressing appointment...

205
00:14:56,858 --> 00:14:58,150
Perhaps another ti--

206
00:14:58,233 --> 00:15:00,650
Children can be very demanding
about their games...

207
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,483
Surely you wouldn't
want me to get upset.

208
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:07,108
No...no, of course not.
Perhaps you would permit me

209
00:15:07,192 --> 00:15:08,608
to use your telephone?

210
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:13,858
I've brought some tea
for you and my lord.

211
00:15:13,942 --> 00:15:15,275
I'll be right back.

212
00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:20,692
What is this...?
It smells terribly weak.

213
00:15:20,775 --> 00:15:22,567
Out of consideration
for our guest,

214
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,192
I've brought some Italian tea.

215
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:25,400
Italian?

216
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:27,942
Italians drink more
coffee than tea, sir,

217
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:31,150
so finding high-quality Italian
tea can be difficult...

218
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:34,317
This particular selection is
not to your liking, master?

219
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:38,108
No, it is not...
I don't like it at all.

220
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:42,733
I'll see to the
dessert preparations.

221
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:47,608
Good... We must show him
every available hospitality.

222
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:51,108
The Phantomhive family
is known for its courtesy.

223
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:53,650
Yes... my young lord.

224
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:04,817
I'm tired of babysitting
this child Earl...

225
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,192
Yes, I've already sold off the
factory... Now all that's left

226
00:16:08,275 --> 00:16:10,733
is to pocket the extra cash...
I'm trying to squeeze

227
00:16:10,817 --> 00:16:13,483
more out of the brat right now.

228
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,817
The employees...?
Who cares about them?

229
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:22,275
Never mind... The rest
of the formalities

230
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:26,942
are for you to deal with...
No... it'll be easy.

231
00:16:27,942 --> 00:16:30,317
Please... he's only a child.

232
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:58,233
Impossible...
I'm seeing things.

233
00:16:59,858 --> 00:17:01,817
"Bewitched by the eyes
of the dead."

234
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,067
No, that's ridiculous.

235
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:13,233
Huh.

236
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:22,108
Not here either... or here.
This manor is like a giant maze.

237
00:17:22,192 --> 00:17:24,275
I can't even find
the drawing room.

238
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:27,733
"Bewitched by the eyes
of the dead."

239
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:41,108
Stay away from meeee!

240
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:43,608
That's odd... Was that
our guest I heard just now?

241
00:17:43,692 --> 00:17:45,692
Hey! We need to move this

242
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:47,692
or Sebastian'll start
yelling again!

243
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,900
Right!

244
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:57,358
How embarrassing...! I really
messed up this time...!

245
00:17:57,442 --> 00:18:02,358
Ooh... But at least I was able
to get close to Sebastian!

246
00:18:02,442 --> 00:18:04,608
Ooooh! What a shameful,
dirty thought...!

247
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:06,900
What kind of
lecherous maid am I?

248
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:10,900
You lose one turn.

249
00:18:20,692 --> 00:18:24,358
Sir, are you all right?
His right leg!...

250
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:27,483
It's twisted 'round!
What happened to it?

251
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:28,692
Hey, what's wrong?

252
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,775
Our guest!
Something happened!

253
00:18:32,983 --> 00:18:36,442
"And now you lose one leg
in the enchanted forest."

254
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:44,400
Sir... Um, sir...come back.

255
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:54,817
Surely you aren't
leaving the manor yet, sir.

256
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,858
We haven't given you the full
Phantomhive treatment yet...

257
00:18:57,942 --> 00:18:59,900
We still have to serve dessert.

258
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,983
You've lost a leg, remember?
Now you can only move half

259
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:06,733
the number of spaces.
So why not just relax a bit

260
00:19:06,817 --> 00:19:08,525
and make yourself at home?

261
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:19,025
Damn... it's too dark.

262
00:19:25,483 --> 00:19:27,275
Is this a cupboard?

263
00:19:36,483 --> 00:19:41,692
Damn... These are really
tight quarters. What's this?

264
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:44,233
It smells like sugar.

265
00:19:49,108 --> 00:19:52,817
What an impatient guest
we have... You couldn't even

266
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,900
restrain yourself until the
dessert was out of the oven.

267
00:19:55,983 --> 00:20:01,442
The...the oven?! Open up...!
Please open the door!

268
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:06,817
Perhaps the Italians aren't
familiar with our customs...

269
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,692
There's plum pudding...
Mincemeat pie...

270
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,858
There are many traditional
desserts in England

271
00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:15,358
that make use of meat...
I find them all quite tasty.

272
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:20,317
"Your body is burnt
by raging flames."

273
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:26,692
What was that...?
Someone screamed.

274
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:29,942
Dunno... Oh...! Hi Sebastian!

275
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:33,150
Thank you for your hard
work today... As a reward,

276
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,942
how would you like some
lemon meringue pie?

277
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:37,942
The sugar will
give you energy.

278
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:42,733
Pie for us, Sebastian?!
You're such a nice person.

279
00:20:42,817 --> 00:20:44,983
You're not all bad! Who knew?
Thank you so much, Sebastian!

280
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:48,733
Oh yes... and Bard...? A workman
will be by in the morning...

281
00:20:48,817 --> 00:20:50,567
When he arrives, kindly let
him know we'll be needing

282
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,150
our oven thoroughly cleaned.

283
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:54,900
Huh...? The oven?

284
00:20:56,192 --> 00:20:59,983
Mr. Damiano... I hope
you enjoyed your stay

285
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:03,233
and the Phantomhive
family hospitality...

286
00:21:03,317 --> 00:21:05,442
all the way down to your bones.

287
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:10,525
Mamma miaaaa!

288
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:13,608
What an unattractive scream...
He sounds almost like a pig

289
00:21:13,692 --> 00:21:16,900
taken off to slaughter.
What presumption!

290
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:20,733
First, he sells the East Indian
factory without telling me...

291
00:21:20,817 --> 00:21:23,025
And then he dares
to ask for more money.

292
00:21:23,108 --> 00:21:25,567
Did he think to
retain my trust?

293
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,275
I'm afraid once something
is truly lost...

294
00:21:37,358 --> 00:21:40,025
one can never
get it back again.

295
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:51,233
It would appear we'll be needing
to hang new wallpaper as well...

296
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:09,150
Mama! Papa!

297
00:22:25,692 --> 00:22:29,400
The new head of the
Phantomhive estate...Huh.

298
00:24:10,317 --> 00:24:12,817
My young master, Ciel,
has another name...

299
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,400
He is also known as
the Queen's Guard Dog

300
00:24:15,483 --> 00:24:18,400
for his role in policing
England's seedy underground...

301
00:24:18,483 --> 00:24:21,733
His small body houses
great determination...

302
00:24:21,817 --> 00:24:24,358
You will marvel at the bravery
he displays when dealing with

303
00:24:24,442 --> 00:24:27,692
a drug trafficking ring...
Also, feel free to admire

304
00:24:27,775 --> 00:24:29,192
my notable skills
with the silver,

305
00:24:29,275 --> 00:24:32,567
upon which I stake my honor as
a Phantomhive butler.

306
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,858
Next time, on Black Butler
"His Butler... Strongest"

307
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:39,650
You see, I'm simply
one hell of a butler.
