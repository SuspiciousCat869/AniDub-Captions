1
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:31,025
I have prepared
your tea Master.

2
00:00:31,108 --> 00:00:33,733
It is not how I am
referred to.

3
00:00:33,817 --> 00:00:38,233
Please forgive the mistake...
I'm sorry. Your Majesty.

4
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,608
Ludlow Castle?

5
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:25,858
As I recall, we're remodeling
that building into a hotel.

6
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:30,150
A petition from
the builders...

7
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:33,400
They want to halt construction
and dissolve the contract.

8
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:54,567
Pathetic... Are these
contractors children?

9
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,525
Canceling construction
because of ghosts...?

10
00:02:57,608 --> 00:03:00,525
There's no such thing.
there can't--

11
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:05,067
You seem a little
unsure of that.

12
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,567
Oh, be quiet... Let's wrap
this up and go home.

13
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,817
Of course.

14
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:20,275
I've seen this painting
before. Is it a replica?

15
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,442
Who gave you two
vagrants permission

16
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:32,108
to enter this castle?

17
00:03:32,192 --> 00:03:33,233
So that's it...

18
00:03:33,317 --> 00:03:35,775
A traveling minstrel
is squatting here.

19
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:38,192
You dare insult me?

20
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:45,775
Me, the king of all England...?
I am Edward the Fifth!

21
00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:50,067
This doesn't
make any sense.

22
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,733
It appears that
ghosts do exist.

23
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:57,858
Approximately 400 years ago,
on the verge of his coronation,

24
00:03:57,942 --> 00:04:00,733
Edward the Fifth was confined
to the Tower of London...

25
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:03,275
along with his little
brother, Richard.

26
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:05,150
They say the two were
eventually murdered

27
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:07,192
by jealous relatives.

28
00:04:09,192 --> 00:04:11,233
This castle is where the
brothers spent their time

29
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,650
when they were young.

30
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:15,900
I'd venture to guess that
their souls have returned.

31
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:19,317
It may have only
been a few months,

32
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,650
but he was still our king...
I can't change that.

33
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:25,483
Understood, my lord.

34
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:27,817
What are you
whispering about?

35
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,900
Your Majesty, may I present
the right honorable

36
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:31,650
Lord Phantomhive

37
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:39,358
Please forgive
my rudeness...

38
00:04:39,442 --> 00:04:40,400
I was unaware
that Your Majesty

39
00:04:40,483 --> 00:04:42,358
was currently in residence.

40
00:04:42,442 --> 00:04:46,608
Fine, you're forgiven. I don't
get many guests, after all.

41
00:04:46,692 --> 00:04:48,400
I am not a guest, sire.

42
00:04:48,483 --> 00:04:51,567
In fact, my company
actually owns this castle.

43
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,567
Oh, so you would be
the new caretaker, then?

44
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,775
Not exactly. If I
may be frank, sire....

45
00:04:56,858 --> 00:04:59,692
I'd like you to vacate
the premises.

46
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,233
You're trying to evict
the king and his brother,

47
00:05:02,317 --> 00:05:03,483
who have lived
here for more than

48
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:04,942
four hundred years?

49
00:05:05,025 --> 00:05:08,358
Naturally, we'll offer you
compensation for the castle.

50
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:11,233
I shall pay every regard
to your wishes.

51
00:05:11,317 --> 00:05:14,358
I'm sure we can come to
an amicable agreement.

52
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,692
Well, well... it seems as
though my brother Richard

53
00:05:19,775 --> 00:05:22,192
has taken a liking to
your butler there.

54
00:05:22,275 --> 00:05:25,067
He's my loyal servant,..
Sebastian Michaelis,

55
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,650
Your Majesty.

56
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:28,692
We would have so much
more fun if there was

57
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:30,108
a butler around!

58
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:32,942
Indeed... he seems to be
quite an unusual butler...

59
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:35,400
I think this could
become interesting.

60
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:44,192
If I win the game you'll
turn over your butler to me.

61
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:45,483
If you win,

62
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:47,775
you can do whatever
you like with the castle.

63
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:50,400
All right... I hope
you don't regret it.

64
00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:53,817
Let's make sure
we both play fairly...

65
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,483
Otherwise it won't
be fun, will it?

66
00:05:56,983 --> 00:05:58,692
Yes, I agree.

67
00:06:05,608 --> 00:06:08,275
I am holding you
to the wager we made.

68
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:11,608
Of course you are.

69
00:06:20,192 --> 00:06:22,733
My... that looks
like checkmate.

70
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:24,733
Majesty!

71
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,192
Were you lying when
you said we were

72
00:06:26,275 --> 00:06:28,275
going to play
a fair game?

73
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:30,608
Excuse me...?
What did you say?

74
00:06:30,692 --> 00:06:31,900
Sire...

75
00:06:31,983 --> 00:06:34,942
Don't you accuse me
of lying... I hate liars!

76
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:38,317
This is still my chess piece.

77
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,067
I merely use my power
to its full potential...

78
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,692
That's not unfair.

79
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:44,442
Your Majesty?

80
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,233
Butler, you have
leave to speak.

81
00:06:48,317 --> 00:06:50,858
Unfortunately, I believe
my master has forgotten

82
00:06:50,942 --> 00:06:52,317
his own creed.

83
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,483
Excuse me?!

84
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:55,650
Surely my master
remembers his belief

85
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:57,317
that those who do not
use their pawns

86
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,192
to the utmost are fools.

87
00:06:59,275 --> 00:07:02,150
My master does not
believe in holding back.

88
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:06,817
Well then... It seems that
our problem is resolved...

89
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,525
Right... Richard?

90
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:17,733
I order you:
Care for these two boys.

91
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:20,442
Do anything your
new masters may ask of you.

92
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:22,400
Are you certain, master?

93
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,942
I'm sure...
I'm the one who lost.

94
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:27,067
Indeed... as you wish then.

95
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,817
Very well, it's settled... I'm
guessing a butler like this

96
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,525
won't die easily...
Sebastan will be our servant

97
00:07:32,608 --> 00:07:33,942
for many years to come.

98
00:07:34,025 --> 00:07:35,442
I will do my best.

99
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:37,942
Come Phantomhive... I would
like to play some more...

100
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:40,608
you'll stay here as my guest.

101
00:07:40,692 --> 00:07:42,567
I am honored, Your Majesty.

102
00:07:44,775 --> 00:07:47,108
Now that you belong to me,
get rid of that

103
00:07:47,192 --> 00:07:50,942
horrible tailcoat...
You look like a crow.

104
00:08:05,942 --> 00:08:08,067
Hey... do you know
what that is?

105
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,150
These are special
Indian tea leaves...

106
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:12,775
They were only
recently discovered.

107
00:08:12,858 --> 00:08:14,692
Your Royal Highness.

108
00:08:18,192 --> 00:08:20,983
He's even ironing the laces
for all my shoes...

109
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,608
Why's he doing that?

110
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:25,983
You are a man
of noble birth.

111
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:28,525
This is simply the proper way
to treat your foot wear.

112
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,150
I've never thought of
it like that.

113
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:33,442
I never even go outside.

114
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:41,525
Your Highness...

115
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:44,025
Do you wish to change clothes
before you have supper?

116
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:45,192
Yes.

117
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,317
Very good. Then let me
hold that for you.

118
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,567
Don't! No!

119
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,108
But how are you going
to change your clothes

120
00:08:50,192 --> 00:08:51,608
if your hands are full?

121
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:54,733
I can't. This is something
really, really important...

122
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:55,775
Right?

123
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:57,442
Who did it belong to?

124
00:08:57,525 --> 00:08:58,942
Not telling!

125
00:08:59,025 --> 00:09:00,817
As you wish Highness.

126
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:07,942
You want to know?

127
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:09,942
Are you at liberty
to tell me?

128
00:09:10,025 --> 00:09:11,150
Not telling!

129
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:13,192
Very well. As you wish.

130
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:16,983
But I can't give you away...
If I did he would be sad...

131
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:18,317
Right?

132
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:21,400
It's your decision, Highness.

133
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,108
"In 1483, two princes
disappeared from

134
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:33,525
the Tower of London. Almost
two hundred years later,

135
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:36,483
the remains of children's
bodies are discovered...

136
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:37,900
Were they the two princes
who had been

137
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:39,400
missing so long...?
And if so, who kill--"

138
00:09:39,483 --> 00:09:41,442
"And if so,
who killed them?"...

139
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:42,983
I'm sorry, but if you
want to find out,

140
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:45,525
you'll have to ask
other dead people.

141
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:48,358
I'm afraid I wouldn't
be able to answer you.

142
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:49,733
Sire?

143
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:54,525
I don't remember anything
from the day I was killed.

144
00:09:54,608 --> 00:09:56,858
It's a blank... One day
I woke up in this castle,

145
00:09:56,942 --> 00:09:58,692
nothing more than a ghost.

146
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:00,733
What a kind man you are.

147
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:02,025
What do you mean?

148
00:10:02,108 --> 00:10:04,775
If I was treated as
despicably as Your Majesty

149
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:06,108
has been...

150
00:10:06,192 --> 00:10:08,858
I would never forget those
who were responsible.

151
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:13,483
Well... it was long ago.
Our killers are dead now...,

152
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:14,983
as are the people
who protected us...

153
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:16,983
They are all long gone
from this earth.

154
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:19,358
As for me, I can't even
remember how it felt

155
00:10:19,442 --> 00:10:21,317
when it was happening.

156
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,692
Pain tends to heal as time
passes... But personally,

157
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:27,275
I don't want time
to heal my wounds.

158
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:29,817
You're strong,...
stronger than most.

159
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:34,025
What's that?!

160
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:36,233
My guess would be
that dinner is ready.

161
00:10:36,317 --> 00:10:39,400
Oh... I see.... Time seems
to pass more quickly

162
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:41,817
when I'm talking
to you, Phantomhive.

163
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:49,067
Please, sit. You don't
have to stand on ceremony.

164
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,817
Thank you, Your Majesty.

165
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:56,067
This is hare. Lovingly roasted,

166
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,858
served with red currant
jelly and some local leeks.

167
00:10:58,942 --> 00:11:00,400
We're eating a bunny!

168
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:04,192
Have you found out
anything yet?

169
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:05,983
Hey...! Sebastian!

170
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:08,733
I must ask our guest
to mind his manners...

171
00:11:08,817 --> 00:11:10,650
Common courtesy
dictates that you carry

172
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:13,150
a conversation with the
person next to you.

173
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:15,400
No one's next to me...!
Honestly!

174
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:17,108
How am I supposed
to talk to them when

175
00:11:17,192 --> 00:11:19,150
they're sitting
so far away?!

176
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:21,692
I wonder what our guest is
making such a fuss about.

177
00:11:21,775 --> 00:11:24,442
Nothing...! I just wanted
to make sure my butler

178
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:25,858
was behaving properly.

179
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:29,608
But I thought Sebastian
was our butler now!

180
00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:31,275
Yes, of course.

181
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,025
A glass of claret, sire.

182
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:38,233
Now then, I propose a toast

183
00:11:38,317 --> 00:11:40,900
to our new friend
and our new butler.

184
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:42,567
Me too!

185
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,400
What's wrong...?
You're not drinking.

186
00:11:44,483 --> 00:11:46,192
Oh... it's nothing.

187
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:55,067
Sebastian...?

188
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,025
Good heavens,...
you can't even manage

189
00:12:19,108 --> 00:12:20,858
to tie your
shoelaces without me?

190
00:12:20,942 --> 00:12:23,567
Sebastian!
What about the princes...?

191
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,567
Or did you come in here
for no other reason than

192
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,233
to laugh at me?

193
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:28,567
You just looked so troubled,

194
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,358
as if a little shoelace
had triumphed over

195
00:12:30,442 --> 00:12:32,192
the great Lord Phantomhive...

196
00:12:32,275 --> 00:12:34,775
I must admit, it was
an entertaining picture.

197
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:36,358
Shut up!

198
00:12:36,442 --> 00:12:39,358
I'm here because I was told to
look after our guest's comfort.

199
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:42,108
If that's all...
I bid you goodnight.

200
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,692
These books...
they're fake...

201
00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:04,525
A secret passage, maybe?

202
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:05,942
Pardon me.

203
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:07,650
Yes? What do you want?

204
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:13,608
I say, Sebastian!

205
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,733
How can I help you,
honored guest...?

206
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:18,025
You want to go inside,
don't you?

207
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:19,942
I haven't given you
a direct order...

208
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:21,317
What do you think
you're doing...?

209
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,525
I make the decisions
around here!

210
00:13:23,608 --> 00:13:24,817
It's just good service.

211
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,150
What?

212
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:28,775
The trick to satisfying a
guest is to think ahead:

213
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:31,567
anticipate his needs
and perform accordingly.

214
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,775
What kind of royal butler
would I be if I couldn't

215
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:36,150
do something
as simple as that?

216
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,858
That's it.
I'm going to kill you.

217
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,858
So the guest does not want
me to open the secret door?

218
00:13:41,608 --> 00:13:42,275
Open it.

219
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:43,942
I would be happy to.

220
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:07,150
What is this?

221
00:14:14,483 --> 00:14:16,442
I believe it's a crypt.

222
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,525
Please be careful.

223
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:22,650
This place has been
untouched by humans for

224
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:24,525
a very long time.

225
00:14:24,608 --> 00:14:26,192
Your Majesty, where are we?

226
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:29,025
Originally, it had been
a dungeon...

227
00:14:29,108 --> 00:14:31,233
Criminals who the church
refused to bury were

228
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:36,192
thrown in here and forgotten...
by even the grim reaper.

229
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:39,150
The path to Heaven is forever
closed to them now...

230
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:41,400
These lost souls
can't be saved.

231
00:14:45,942 --> 00:14:46,983
Once, on a whim,

232
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:49,358
I made something
to remember them by.

233
00:14:51,817 --> 00:14:54,483
Here... let me introduce you.

234
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:57,650
The king is the father and
the queen is my mother.

235
00:14:57,733 --> 00:15:00,442
I suppose I could have been
a bit more original...

236
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,025
That rook is Earl Rivers...
and my uncle over there

237
00:15:03,108 --> 00:15:06,233
is the bishop.
The family is reunited.

238
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,775
One of the knights is missing.

239
00:15:10,858 --> 00:15:12,858
That place is for Richard.

240
00:15:12,942 --> 00:15:14,317
You can't find him?

241
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,900
That's not it... He's here.

242
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,900
I have the bones that
came from the Tower

243
00:15:18,983 --> 00:15:20,817
two hundred years ago...

244
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,192
But Richard found the skull,
and he won't let it go.

245
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:26,733
Don't you see...?
Surely you must...

246
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:29,858
All I want is to send
my brother on...

247
00:15:29,942 --> 00:15:34,650
I want him to live with God.
Where there is no pain.

248
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,525
Send him to Heaven... with God.

249
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:40,858
Yes... and that wish
will come true

250
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:44,192
if I can complete this set.

251
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:45,483
All right. In other words,

252
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:48,025
if you can get that skull,
you'll be satisfied.

253
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:50,317
All you want is
to have the skull...

254
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,317
No matter what
the sacrifice?

255
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,900
That's right...
If I can do that, then--

256
00:15:54,983 --> 00:15:56,233
Sebastian.

257
00:15:56,317 --> 00:15:57,233
Yes?

258
00:15:57,317 --> 00:15:59,358
I order you...
go get that skull!

259
00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:02,108
Indeed...
my young lord.

260
00:16:02,192 --> 00:16:04,275
And take the chessboard
to the hall.

261
00:16:04,358 --> 00:16:05,442
Yes, sir.

262
00:16:05,525 --> 00:16:07,358
I don't understand.
What are you doing?

263
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:10,525
I am simply fulfilling
your most dire wish,

264
00:16:10,608 --> 00:16:15,150
Majesty. This is...
the easiest method.

265
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:16,983
No! Stop it!

266
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:20,067
Please just put me down!
Sebastian!

267
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,358
Terribly sorry,
Your Highness.

268
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,942
How sad... I was so
looking forward to

269
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:27,733
a fight between
a demon and a ghost.

270
00:16:27,817 --> 00:16:29,067
What a pity.

271
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,942
Let me go, Sebastian...!
Brother...! Brother, help!

272
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,150
I'm sorry...!
Come now, don't you think

273
00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:36,983
you can be a little bit
more gentle?!

274
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:39,150
You got yourself
into this... Really...

275
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:41,275
This has been going on
for two hundred years.

276
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:42,692
Don't you think it's silly?

277
00:16:42,775 --> 00:16:45,900
I don't want to see my brother
cry. That isn't silly!

278
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,192
No!

279
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:50,442
What are you doing?!

280
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:52,692
Nothing more than giving
you what you asked for.

281
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:54,775
You can't ...!
Give it back to me!

282
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:58,108
He'll help me...!
My brother will help!

283
00:16:58,192 --> 00:17:01,858
I am your sovereign...
I order you to let him go!

284
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:04,358
Brother!

285
00:17:10,525 --> 00:17:12,692
I'm sorry to say this,
Your Majesty...

286
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:13,900
But for a king,

287
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,983
I find you to be
extraordinarily powerless.

288
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:18,067
No!

289
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,483
Please, no!

290
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:31,233
Stop it!

291
00:17:33,317 --> 00:17:36,192
I instructed you to stop...
I am your king.

292
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:38,192
You said this skull
was what you wanted,

293
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:40,400
no matter what
the sacrifice might be...

294
00:17:40,483 --> 00:17:43,400
If you take that statement
back now... well then...

295
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:46,150
You're no better than
the liars you claim to hate!

296
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,650
Sebastian... listen to me!

297
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:51,483
You must obey,
you belong us now!

298
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:53,692
I'm sorry, Sire.

299
00:17:53,775 --> 00:17:55,442
You have never
been my master...

300
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:58,692
I'm contractually obligated
to the Earl Phantomhive...

301
00:17:58,775 --> 00:18:00,900
I only served you
and your brother...

302
00:18:00,983 --> 00:18:03,775
because I was ordered to.
All this time,

303
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:07,442
I have faithfully carried out
the orders of my true master.

304
00:18:09,317 --> 00:18:12,317
You... You betrayed us, too?!

305
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,067
No, there has been
no betrayal.

306
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,692
I have always been faithful...
to the master I truly serve.

307
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:21,733
Now then...
if we're sending you

308
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:24,067
to this Heaven place
you want to see so badly,

309
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,942
I suppose I can be
your chief mourner.

310
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:29,192
No, my brother!
Edward...! My brother!

311
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,233
It's all right,
Richard, I promise...

312
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:33,358
I will always be with you.

313
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:36,692
And now... we can end this.

314
00:18:36,775 --> 00:18:39,817
Once we do this...
you can move on.

315
00:18:53,483 --> 00:18:56,483
What's wrong...?
Why's nothing happening?

316
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:01,025
I think there's
something Prince Richard

317
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:03,192
would like to tell
His Majesty.

318
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:05,150
I couldn't...

319
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:07,733
If I'd told, brother
would have been sad.

320
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,108
I'm sorry, brother...

321
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,025
I shouldn't have lied
to you like that.

322
00:19:15,108 --> 00:19:18,567
Lied...? Richard,
I don't understand.

323
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,358
That skull, the one I carry...
It's not mine.

324
00:19:21,442 --> 00:19:23,442
It isn't even part
of the family...

325
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:25,442
The skull belongs
to someone else,

326
00:19:25,525 --> 00:19:27,400
someone we don't even know.

327
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:30,150
No, that... can't be.

328
00:19:30,233 --> 00:19:33,317
You forgot...
Our bones don't exist...

329
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,525
They have already gone away.

330
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:38,567
Since that day...
they've been lost.

331
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:44,733
You're right.
That day... they were lost.

332
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,567
That nice guard
said goodnight to us

333
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,275
just like he always did.

334
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:51,150
But he was the one
who let the assassin in.

335
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:54,317
He said we didn't have
to worry about anything,

336
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,275
because he would protect us.

337
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:01,775
That's why I hate
liars so much.

338
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:04,900
First me... then my
younger brother...

339
00:20:04,983 --> 00:20:07,567
I saw it from a body
that couldn't move.

340
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,608
I'm sorry, Richard... You
must have been so frightened.

341
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:15,650
But Brother...
you know what?

342
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:17,400
The scariest part
was when I thought

343
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,775
I'd never get
to see you again...

344
00:20:19,858 --> 00:20:21,900
I couldn't bear that.

345
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:24,692
Then they chopped
our bodies into pieces...

346
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:27,108
and threw us in the Temes.

347
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:30,025
The fish picked away at us...
we sank into the mud...

348
00:20:30,108 --> 00:20:33,400
and our flesh
and bones were gone.

349
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,900
I am so sorry, Richard...!
How could I have forgotten

350
00:20:35,983 --> 00:20:38,025
something like that...?!
How could I forget

351
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:40,108
the night I failed
to protect you?!

352
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:42,650
Brother... please don't cry.

353
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:45,317
Earl Phantomhive...
you were right all along...

354
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,900
All the hatred and all the
pain... they've been with me

355
00:20:47,983 --> 00:20:49,567
for four hundred years.

356
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,983
Pain tends to heal
as time passes...

357
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:55,775
But personally, I don't want
time to heal my wounds.

358
00:20:55,858 --> 00:20:57,317
You may think
you've escaped the pain

359
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
and forgotten it...

360
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:00,650
but that's nothing more
than stagnation.

361
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:03,317
You can't move forward
without the pain.

362
00:21:03,858 --> 00:21:07,775
I see now... I've spent so
much time hating liars,

363
00:21:07,858 --> 00:21:08,983
and all the while,

364
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:12,442
I was the one lying
to myself and Richard.

365
00:21:12,525 --> 00:21:15,275
Look brother...!
You're glowing!

366
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,775
What's going--?

367
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,400
Preparing the funeral was never
anything but a formality.

368
00:21:19,483 --> 00:21:22,067
It wasn't bones or
ceremonies that had

369
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,025
the true power to release
your wandering souls.

370
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,025
I am in your debt,
Phantomhive.

371
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:37,733
I wish you a long life.

372
00:21:37,817 --> 00:21:40,150
Really, I didn't do
much of anything.

373
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,817
And one more thing... You don't
need to fear for the castle...

374
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,192
I'll take care of it.
That much I promise you.

375
00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:48,650
That eases my mind, thank you.

376
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:51,650
Goodbye now...! Thank
you...! You were great.

377
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:54,817
Take care, your royal highness.

378
00:22:08,358 --> 00:22:12,608
Well, that's that... The
nuisances are finally gone.

379
00:22:12,692 --> 00:22:17,233
Let's make up for lost time!
Work, work, work!

380
00:22:18,483 --> 00:22:19,900
You liar.

381
00:22:26,025 --> 00:22:31,108
Hatred and sorrow are power...
They are yours to control...

382
00:22:31,192 --> 00:22:33,942
All you have to do is turn
them into strength...

383
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:37,775
And use that strength
to move forward.

384
00:24:11,067 --> 00:24:12,358
I should warn you....

385
00:24:12,442 --> 00:24:14,233
Next week's episode
includes some moments

386
00:24:14,317 --> 00:24:17,025
you may not want to watch
in mixed company...

387
00:24:17,108 --> 00:24:18,650
It could make for
a bit of awkwardness

388
00:24:18,733 --> 00:24:20,858
in the drawing room.

389
00:24:20,942 --> 00:24:21,942
If this should happen,

390
00:24:22,025 --> 00:24:23,817
a coughing fit
can be very effective.

391
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,567
Really... I highly
recommend it.

392
00:24:31,025 --> 00:24:34,108
Next time, on Black Butler...
"His Butler, Offering."

393
00:24:34,192 --> 00:24:37,358
You see... I am simply
one hell of a butler.
