1
00:00:27,608 --> 00:00:30,150
Maria...! Maria, are you there?

2
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,900
Oh, Hello there Ms. Luida...

3
00:00:35,983 --> 00:00:37,942
I've brought you
some beef stew dearie...

4
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:39,983
It seems I've made
far too much...

5
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:42,650
Maybe you'll be sweet and
help me finish the rest...?

6
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:45,817
What is this? Where did
all these gifts come from?

7
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:56,942
Oh my, that looks
like a baby's rattle.

8
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:59,150
Who could have
sent you all this?

9
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:14,858
Finni, help me with this!

10
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,317
Yeah, okay!

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,567
Oh! ...Don't forget
his under clothes!

12
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,233
Tanaka. How is it coming?

13
00:01:22,317 --> 00:01:23,733
Young master...

14
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:27,442
Everything has been carried
out to your specifications.

15
00:01:27,525 --> 00:01:33,692
My lord Pardon me...
I've taken care of our lodgings.

16
00:01:33,775 --> 00:01:35,025
Very well Sebastian.

17
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:41,025
I say, young master... where
exactly are you two going

18
00:01:41,108 --> 00:01:42,233
on this trip of yours?

19
00:01:42,317 --> 00:01:44,108
You mean to tell me
you've been helping out

20
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,400
with the packing all this
time without knowing that?!

21
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,400
Paris.

22
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:31,942
Her Majesty arrived in
Paris three days ago...

23
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:34,692
She should be viewing
the Exposition now.

24
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:39,233
I'm sure the hotel will be
heavily guarded, so we--

25
00:03:40,942 --> 00:03:42,192
Master?

26
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:44,900
Yes, what is it?

27
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:49,317
Well, sir... your mind
seems to be adrift.

28
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,817
It's what Lau said.

29
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,233
That the Queen wants
to plunge Europe,

30
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:57,025
no, the entire world into war.

31
00:03:57,108 --> 00:04:00,275
Is that why you seek an
audience with Her Majesty?

32
00:04:00,358 --> 00:04:01,733
No.

33
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:04,483
Well then... Is it
because your heart

34
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:06,858
was so moved by
the death of Abberline?

35
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:10,983
It isn't... They have all been
my pawns from the beginning.

36
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:12,817
You should keep your
distance from me...

37
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,150
If you want to live.

38
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:16,483
He was a pawn...

39
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:19,275
A disobedient pawn who
ignored my will and kept

40
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,692
sticking his nose in.

41
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:25,567
The same goes for Lau... If you
can't control your pawns...

42
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,483
well then,
you can't play the game.

43
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,275
That's all there is to it.

44
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:39,650
The Eiffel Tower marks the
entrance to the Exhibition...

45
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:41,650
Then there is the
Champ de Mars, which houses

46
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:43,358
the Palace of Fine Arts.

47
00:04:45,483 --> 00:04:47,108
Then we have Machinery Hall,

48
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:50,900
where one can see the pinnacle
of modern technology.

49
00:04:50,983 --> 00:04:53,275
There's an exhibition
on horticulture.

50
00:04:53,358 --> 00:04:56,858
The Esplanade des Invalides
features a colonial exhibition.

51
00:04:57,942 --> 00:05:00,567
From what I've heard,
it features a reproduction

52
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,692
of the ruins of Angkor,
along with some lively

53
00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:04,483
folk dancing.

54
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,317
Additionally,
I understand that

55
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,692
Buffalo Bill's Wild West
Cowboy Show

56
00:05:11,775 --> 00:05:13,900
is here all the way
from the States.

57
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:17,358
This is quite a
special occasion...

58
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,608
Perhaps we should look
around some more, my lord...

59
00:05:20,692 --> 00:05:22,817
as research for the company.

60
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:25,317
You're sure?

61
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,942
Yes, they say there's
a stuffed angel at

62
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:28,900
the Palace of Wonders!

63
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:31,025
That I must see!

64
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:32,733
A stuffed angel? Really?

65
00:05:38,858 --> 00:05:41,275
Pathetic. It's nothing more
than a stuffed monkey...

66
00:05:41,358 --> 00:05:43,233
What a bore. Let's move on.

67
00:05:54,692 --> 00:05:55,650
What's happening?!

68
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,233
What is that thing?

69
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:01,733
Calm yourself,
young master.

70
00:06:01,817 --> 00:06:03,108
But this--

71
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:05,567
You're used to living
in the darkness...

72
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:09,442
This should be nothing... The
lights have only dimmed a bit.

73
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:14,275
You should leave here now...
Master, please entrust

74
00:06:14,358 --> 00:06:16,275
this situation to my care.

75
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:23,233
He's right... I'm used
to living in the darkness.

76
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:26,233
My soul has been mired
in this darkness...

77
00:06:26,317 --> 00:06:28,400
for a long, long time.

78
00:06:29,317 --> 00:06:30,317
Ciel...

79
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,483
Ciel...

80
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:35,442
Since that day...
Forever after...

81
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:39,108
I've been running...
In the dark.

82
00:06:53,858 --> 00:06:57,608
It's so bright. Can it be...?

83
00:06:57,692 --> 00:07:00,400
Is this really
the world I live in?

84
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,442
My, you're in a hurry,
aren't you?

85
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:38,400
Is it you?!

86
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:42,483
Ciel... It's been a while.

87
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:44,108
Your Majesty!

88
00:07:57,275 --> 00:08:03,733
Quite a view, wouldn't you say?
As we face the next century,

89
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:08,442
Europe is on the verge
of change... However...

90
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:14,150
We are stained.
We are stagnating.

91
00:08:16,358 --> 00:08:18,317
We are unclean.

92
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:22,775
The state must be wiped clean.

93
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:27,608
No creation without
destruction. The new century

94
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:31,442
must be pure... and so I
have cleansed the house

95
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:35,108
that has seen fit to sully
our great country.

96
00:08:35,192 --> 00:08:37,608
The house of Phantomhive.

97
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,275
How very tasteless.

98
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:57,567
What's this?

99
00:09:00,358 --> 00:09:07,483
London Bridge is falling down,
falling down, falling down.

100
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:08,608
Lon--

101
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:12,442
She's here.
I know it now. It's her...

102
00:09:21,983 --> 00:09:24,817
Might I ask
you something?

103
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,317
What is it?

104
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
You didn't simply kill them...

105
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:31,233
Why did you have to make it
a slaughter?

106
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:34,817
You should watch how you
speak to your queen, Ciel...

107
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,567
I cleansed them.

108
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,233
Burning your subjects alive?!

109
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:40,733
That's what you
consider cleansing?!

110
00:09:40,817 --> 00:09:41,900
And you don't?

111
00:09:41,983 --> 00:09:43,067
Never!

112
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,942
But Ciel... I was only...
Only paying tribute

113
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:51,400
to the Phantomhives for the
loyalty they showed me

114
00:09:51,483 --> 00:09:53,358
for so long.

115
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:54,608
You what?!

116
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:09,400
Terribly surprised, aren't you?

117
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,650
Her Majesty is the
absolute picture of youth.

118
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:13,858
Ashe!

119
00:10:15,608 --> 00:10:18,858
Her great loss, the loss
of her beloved husband,

120
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:21,567
ended Her Majesty's happiness.

121
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,108
She was a truly wretched
creature, pained and mourning

122
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,275
her husband's death to
a degree that threatened

123
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:29,525
even her own survival.

124
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:37,817
Indeed, her grief was
so great that she tried

125
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,775
to end her life.

126
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:44,108
In an attempt to save her,
I joined his body with hers

127
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:46,317
that they might live
together forever.

128
00:10:47,483 --> 00:10:49,358
You what--?!

129
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,525
I can tell that my late
husband is pleased with

130
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:55,775
what I have done
to keep us together...

131
00:10:55,858 --> 00:11:00,983
I can feel his body still...
His heart beats inside me.

132
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:05,817
Thump... thump...
the throbbing of life.

133
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,192
Truly, what greater joy
can there be than

134
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:10,608
being made one with the
person that you love...?

135
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:13,317
I did the same for your
parents... They left this world

136
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,733
together as one. So it
wasn't such a ghastly death

137
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:21,233
as you imagine... Come Ciel...
Surely you must agree?

138
00:11:22,442 --> 00:11:25,650
The Queen and her husband
firmly intend to guide England

139
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:31,067
to a world of perfect light...
a world of beauty and harmony.

140
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:35,025
That aim has purged Her
Majesty of her impurities...

141
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:38,567
And now she is the
chaste girl that you see.

142
00:11:39,983 --> 00:11:42,608
Hers is a truly noble goal...

143
00:11:42,692 --> 00:11:45,817
She is indeed a most worthy
master for an angel.

144
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,192
You? An angel?
Surely you're joking!

145
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:51,150
It's time, Ashe...
Unsheathe your blade...

146
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:53,692
Ciel deserves to see
the end of it.

147
00:11:55,317 --> 00:11:58,317
Ashe's blade is a thing
of true beauty...

148
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,733
It will usher forth the
brightness and purity of

149
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:02,942
a new century.

150
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:06,317
I shall draw my sword
against thy wisdom...

151
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,567
and I shall punish the
beast within thee...

152
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:13,067
And then I shall bring thee
down into the pit.

153
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:18,525
May the great beauty of Heaven
greet you, Ciel Phantomhive.

154
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,150
An impressive sword... but
utterly useless if you're

155
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:31,108
unable to land a blow.

156
00:12:33,025 --> 00:12:34,150
Master...

157
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:36,567
I think this may be
the end of our journey.

158
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:40,442
Now... my orders?

159
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:45,400
Ciel, no...

160
00:12:45,483 --> 00:12:48,650
Sebastian... Kill Ashe.

161
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:51,025
Is that all...
young master?

162
00:12:52,442 --> 00:12:56,108
No, also... kill the Queen!

163
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,067
Ciel!

164
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,442
Yes, my lord.

165
00:13:08,442 --> 00:13:13,067
No stop... This is dreadful...!
Please stop him...!

166
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,567
Do something,
please! Ciel!

167
00:13:20,275 --> 00:13:21,233
Oh dear!

168
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:22,442
Watch out!

169
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:28,483
No...! Sebastian, stop!

170
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:31,400
Oh? Why?

171
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:32,900
We're starting to
attract attention...

172
00:13:32,983 --> 00:13:36,733
At this rate, the entire
city will be out here soon.

173
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:41,317
And why should we worry? They're
only puny humans, after all.

174
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,692
No...! We are withdrawing!

175
00:13:50,108 --> 00:13:51,775
He has angel wings!

176
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,150
Master... Why did you stop me?

177
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:24,192
I told you, we were attracting
too much attention...

178
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:25,817
that's all.

179
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,358
All right. I see.

180
00:14:27,442 --> 00:14:29,525
You want to
say something?

181
00:14:29,608 --> 00:14:31,150
What you wanted from me...

182
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:34,358
was vengeance against the ones
who dragged you into hell.

183
00:14:37,483 --> 00:14:41,317
Did it mean nothing... the
vow you swore to me then.

184
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
You have summoned
me here today.

185
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:47,442
That can never be changed...

186
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:51,442
and nothing sacrificed
can ever be regained.

187
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:54,233
Now choose.

188
00:14:54,317 --> 00:14:55,775
I order you.

189
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,442
Kill them!

190
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:08,942
I will become your sword...

191
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:13,108
I will carry out your
revenge... In exchange...

192
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:16,858
You want my soul...?
You are welcome to it.

193
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:18,483
You have no doubt?

194
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:20,067
None at all.

195
00:15:22,317 --> 00:15:23,400
On that day,

196
00:15:23,483 --> 00:15:26,358
I thought you had
no doubt in your mind.

197
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:28,942
Will you maintain your
loyalty to the Queen,

198
00:15:29,025 --> 00:15:31,150
even after learning the truth?

199
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:35,275
I never even felt a scrap of
loyalty to her to begin with...

200
00:15:35,358 --> 00:15:37,192
Never... I merely
acted as the head

201
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:39,567
of the Phantomhive
family that's all.

202
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,608
Very well... so you
value your soul now?

203
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,983
My soul? What would
I want with that...?

204
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:47,650
You're being stupid...
Do you honestly think that--

205
00:15:53,442 --> 00:15:55,858
You seem a bit
tired... my lord.

206
00:15:55,942 --> 00:15:57,692
Perhaps it would be
a good idea now

207
00:15:57,775 --> 00:15:59,442
to return to your room.

208
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,483
What a loathsome city.

209
00:16:10,983 --> 00:16:12,358
Since that day...

210
00:16:12,442 --> 00:16:15,108
you've spent your time
buttoning my shirts...

211
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:18,400
I never imagined having
a demon for a butler...

212
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:21,983
But you've done
remarkably well.

213
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:24,483
After all what kind
of butler would I be?

214
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:29,317
That's quite enough
for tonight sir... now...

215
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,275
You really should get some
sleep... young master.

216
00:16:37,775 --> 00:16:41,650
Please just let it all go. May
your dreams be pleasant ones.

217
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:02,692
You do have a chance,
Ciel... to move forward,

218
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:04,900
and build a future for
yourself from the wreckage

219
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,233
of your past...

220
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:09,317
Don't ever forget that...
Promise me, you won't...

221
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,317
I have no future.

222
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:17,733
Give up your title as her dog.

223
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:22,733
You don't have to keep it.
It's not you!

224
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,483
Sebastian...?

225
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:35,608
Sebastian!

226
00:17:35,692 --> 00:17:38,400
Hey, Sebastian,
where are you?

227
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:40,525
Come on, don't you hear me?

228
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,400
Sebastian!

229
00:17:50,275 --> 00:17:53,317
I'm Earl Phantomhive.
In room 702.

230
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,358
Do you know
where my butler is?

231
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:57,608
One moment, please, my lord.

232
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:12,192
His mark wasn't gone...
but still....

233
00:18:12,275 --> 00:18:17,400
Please just let it all go. May
your dreams be pleasant ones.

234
00:18:17,483 --> 00:18:19,900
He would never wish me
pleasant dreams.

235
00:18:19,983 --> 00:18:24,692
And then he said 'let it
all go.'... Was that...

236
00:18:24,775 --> 00:18:26,733
A farewell?

237
00:18:30,858 --> 00:18:32,817
London isn't that far...

238
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,108
I'm certain I can
get there on my own.

239
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:42,817
Please take me
to the Port of Calais.

240
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,067
Really...?

241
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,150
And may I ask what exactly
you're willing to pay?

242
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:50,067
How much do you want?

243
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,900
Here we are.

244
00:19:01,983 --> 00:19:05,275
Pardon? I asked for
the Port of Calais.

245
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:08,275
So sorry, but I live elsewhere.

246
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:12,192
Let me down!

247
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:14,567
Well kid I'm sure you'll
eventually hit the port

248
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,025
that you need...
That's assuming you keep

249
00:19:17,108 --> 00:19:19,108
walking straight, of course.

250
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,150
Get back here...!

251
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:23,525
Do what I paid you for,
you bounder!

252
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:57,442
I would like a room
for the night.

253
00:19:57,525 --> 00:19:58,483
You'll be paying?

254
00:19:58,567 --> 00:19:59,733
I can't right now...

255
00:19:59,817 --> 00:20:02,108
but I'll be sending money
from London later.

256
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,233
Are you toying with me?!
I am Ciel Phantomhive...

257
00:20:09,317 --> 00:20:11,108
Everyone knows that name...!

258
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:13,108
What kind of business
are you running?

259
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:15,233
Haven't you ever heard
of my company?!

260
00:20:15,317 --> 00:20:16,900
Take a look at this ring...!

261
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:19,358
This ring has been passed
down through generations!

262
00:20:19,442 --> 00:20:22,983
All right,
I'll take that, then.

263
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:25,942
In exchange for the ring,
I'll let you stay...

264
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:29,775
The gem isn't bad kid...
so I'll throw in breakfast, too.

265
00:20:29,858 --> 00:20:31,358
Excuse me?!

266
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,233
You honestly think I would
give this to rubbish

267
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:37,358
like you?

268
00:20:47,317 --> 00:20:49,067
I'm so hungry.

269
00:20:53,567 --> 00:20:56,483
It's cold... Would you
like to come here?

270
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:04,775
Now even you're trying to
make a fool out of me?!

271
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:07,775
Get back here!

272
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,567
Oh, it was right here...
I was this close.

273
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:26,608
I wandered everywhere...
unable to find it.

274
00:21:26,692 --> 00:21:32,817
But it was right here...
all along... so close to me.

275
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:09,150
Oh, no!

276
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:11,775
Water! Water!
Get some water!

277
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,233
The infernal cries of a
soulless beast echo through

278
00:24:14,317 --> 00:24:16,317
the smoldering streets
of London...

279
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,025
and I find myself
without a master...

280
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:20,900
would you by chance
wish to enter into

281
00:24:20,983 --> 00:24:22,442
a contract with me?...

282
00:24:22,525 --> 00:24:24,733
why not... when the
moment of truth comes,

283
00:24:24,817 --> 00:24:26,942
I shall plunge you
into a deep fathomless

284
00:24:27,025 --> 00:24:30,275
soothing darkness
as gently as possible...

285
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:32,067
the pain shall be brief...

286
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,067
Next time, on Black Butler...

287
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,650
"His Butler,
Up in Flames."

288
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:38,525
You see I'm simply
one hell of a demon.
