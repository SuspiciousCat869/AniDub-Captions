1
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,692
Holiday, holiday we're
going on holiday!

2
00:00:17,775 --> 00:00:22,025
...Holiday, holiday, we're
going on holiday!

3
00:00:22,108 --> 00:00:24,858
This is so exciting...
I can't believe it!

4
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,400
Spectacular...!
He's actually bringing us...!

5
00:00:27,483 --> 00:00:30,317
We get to go on holiday
at the Queen's own resort!

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,275
Looks like the young master
can be quite generous

7
00:00:32,358 --> 00:00:34,275
when the spirit moves 'im, eh?

8
00:00:35,358 --> 00:00:39,317
Do you hear how happy they are?
They're very grateful to you...

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,567
Such a kind young master.

10
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,192
I couldn't leave
them there alone...

11
00:00:43,275 --> 00:00:45,650
I might come home to find
the manor in shambles.

12
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:47,192
Indeed.

13
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,067
It seems we've arrived
at the village everyone.

14
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,858
--Oh, wow!
--All right

15
00:01:01,983 --> 00:01:03,942
Oh yes, I forgot
to mention something...

16
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:05,692
The resort that the Queen
is planning has yet

17
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:07,442
to be constructed.

18
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,275
Yes, master...

19
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,442
A holiday, young master...?
In this season?

20
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:53,942
Yes, indeed...
Tell me, have you ever heard of

21
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:56,108
a pastime known as bear-baiting?

22
00:02:56,192 --> 00:02:58,733
The notion does
sound entertaining...

23
00:02:58,817 --> 00:03:00,692
but I'm afraid
I have not heard of it.

24
00:03:00,775 --> 00:03:02,400
Indulge me, sir?

25
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,567
A bear is chained to a fence...
It is then surrounded

26
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,317
by vicious dogs,
which slowly bite and kill it.

27
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,692
That sounds like something...
only a human would dream up.

28
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:18,192
It was banned back in 1835
When the Cruelty to Animals Act

29
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:20,067
was instated...
However there was

30
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,400
still a loophole...
The attack dogs that they used

31
00:03:22,483 --> 00:03:26,275
were not banned...
So a new game developed.

32
00:03:26,358 --> 00:03:29,817
They used dogs to attack dogs...
Let's see...

33
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,608
would that be 'dog baiting'?

34
00:03:31,692 --> 00:03:33,733
There's a village in which
it's quite popular...

35
00:03:33,817 --> 00:03:36,192
known as Houndsworth...
It has long been known for

36
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:39,942
raising fierce hunting dogs...
but they take it further.

37
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,983
It breaks Her Majesty's heart.
So, we'll secure the village

38
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:59,692
as land for a royal estate...
A simple pretext

39
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:01,983
to end the atrocities.

40
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,650
A village full of dogs?

41
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:04,942
Yes, why?

42
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:07,192
Well... please
forgive me, master...

43
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:09,900
but this seems a rather
insignificant task for one

44
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,817
of your station to take on.

45
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,400
Sebastian.

46
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:16,858
You should know by now
that I have my reasons...

47
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:22,692
This is indeed a task
fit for a Phantomhive.

48
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:40,067
Look...!
Somebody actually lives here!

49
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,817
Tanaka, stop!

50
00:04:47,608 --> 00:04:49,233
Let me help you, Granny!

51
00:04:49,317 --> 00:04:51,150
No, you shouldn't
do that, Finni...!

52
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:53,358
If you aren't careful,
you might hurt the baby!

53
00:04:53,442 --> 00:04:58,067
What did you say?
I'm so sorry!

54
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,733
This is awful!
Is the baby okay?

55
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:08,483
There is no baby...
There is no baby anymore,

56
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:12,692
the child was eaten by it.
The white dog is a good dog,

57
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:13,567
a good dog, good.

58
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,608
--Eaten?
--Wha...?

59
00:05:15,692 --> 00:05:18,358
The black dog is a bad dog,
a bad dog, bad...

60
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:19,817
He'll eat your flesh
down to the bone...

61
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,233
That's why we're here...
Apparently, a lot of villagers

62
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:25,108
have been violently killed
or gone missing...

63
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,025
The village has shrunk
to a third of its size

64
00:05:27,108 --> 00:05:29,942
in the last ten years...
A part of my task is to find out

65
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:33,025
why and put an end the problem.

66
00:05:47,192 --> 00:05:50,483
Oi! It's startin' to look like
a place worth stayin'!

67
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,233
Sit. Lie down.
Who's a good boy!

68
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:13,775
My good boy!

69
00:06:13,858 --> 00:06:18,608
Oh my...! I'd let him pet me,
yes I would, uh-huh!

70
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:22,067
He manipulates the creature
with rewards and punishments.

71
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,650
He commands the mutt's
obedience but...

72
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:28,650
the dog isn't blameless either.
It fawns on its human

73
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:32,108
And welcomes the chain
around its neck...

74
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,233
I can't understand it.

75
00:06:34,317 --> 00:06:36,733
If you're trying to get at
something deeper, just say it.

76
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:39,233
No, it is nothing
of import, my lord.

77
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:44,317
Simply that, while I love cats,
I'm not especially fond of dogs.

78
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:48,233
To be completely frank,
I hate them.

79
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,400
Woof.

80
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,858
I presume this is
the Earl of Phantomhive?

81
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:12,442
Yes.

82
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:16,400
Welcome to Barrymore Castle...
My master awaits your arrival.

83
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,442
Hey...

84
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,067
Oh...! She's lovely, yes she is!

85
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:31,650
This way.

86
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,442
Who the hell is this Chihuahua?
I told you to bring me the

87
00:07:44,525 --> 00:07:47,442
"Queen's Guard Dog"
when he arrived!

88
00:07:47,525 --> 00:07:49,192
"Chihuahua...?"

89
00:07:49,275 --> 00:07:52,483
Can't you...do...anything?!

90
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:56,983
Move, Sebastian.

91
00:07:58,192 --> 00:08:00,900
What are you doing,
you filthy Doberman...?

92
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:03,692
Someone should train you better.
Let me go right now!

93
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,817
He's acting on my orders.

94
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,150
Who're you?!

95
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:08,483
From the sound of it,
you have already received

96
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:11,233
the letter I sent...
My name is Ciel,

97
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:12,817
the Earl of Phantomhive.

98
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,150
Do you mean to tell me
a toy poodle like you

99
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,858
is the Queen's emissary?

100
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:20,192
You don't like small breeds,
Lord Henry...?

101
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:21,983
Now that's hardly fair.

102
00:08:26,775 --> 00:08:29,900
Quit acting like a loon, Finni!
You've got bags to carry!

103
00:08:29,983 --> 00:08:31,483
Hurry it up!

104
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:40,858
Please, Miss, allow me.

105
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:47,942
There's nothing to discuss...
Under no circumstances will I

106
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:50,192
sell Barrymore Castle to anyone.

107
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:51,608
Why is that?

108
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:54,442
Because of the curse.

109
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:56,108
Oh? What curse?

110
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:59,858
This village and its dogs
have existed for centuries...

111
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:02,817
Anyone who interferes with us
will be cursed.

112
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,525
In a most horrible way.

113
00:09:05,608 --> 00:09:07,608
Even the queen cannot
lift the curse...

114
00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:10,317
Your mission is pointless...
Anyone who acts against

115
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,150
the wishes of the Barrymore
family is destined to meet

116
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:15,483
an unimaginably terrible end!

117
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:17,983
My...how interesting.

118
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:19,567
What?!

119
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,150
You've piqued my curiosity...
I'd like to see this dreadful

120
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:24,608
curse of yours, Lord Henry.

121
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:33,150
Really...? You're the only maid
for this entire estate?

122
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:35,067
That's amazing!
I don't know how you

123
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,025
get everything done, Angela.

124
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:39,983
It's nothing that impressive,
I promise you...

125
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:41,525
I'm a mess most of the time.

126
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:44,067
Just let us know if there's
something we can help you with.

127
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,317
After all, we servants have
gotta stick together, right?

128
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,608
Finni... am I right?

129
00:09:48,692 --> 00:09:49,692
Of course!

130
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:51,858
How kind of you
to offer your help...

131
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:52,983
Thank you all.

132
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:58,942
I have to go right away...
My master is calling...

133
00:09:59,025 --> 00:10:00,775
Please excuse me.

134
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:15,900
Angela's so pretty.

135
00:10:20,442 --> 00:10:22,983
Oi, Finni...
what're you doing?

136
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:24,567
Coming!

137
00:10:32,025 --> 00:10:33,483
Angela...

138
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:36,358
Angela...
The Queen wants to take

139
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:38,442
my village from me!
You understand what

140
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:41,650
I have to do, don't you...?
I must protect it.

141
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:43,858
I must protect the village.

142
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:51,692
Angela...my dear Angela.
My sweet, darling angel.

143
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:55,192
I shouldn'tve seen!
I shouldn't've seen that at all!

144
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,567
Come in.

145
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,900
I apologize for calling so late.

146
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:06,067
What is it you need?
My young master is about

147
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,942
to retire for the evening.

148
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,025
I have a request to make...
leave the castle.

149
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:16,150
Leave the village completely...
You mustn't stay here.

150
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:17,483
Why is that?

151
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:18,858
I can't say...

152
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:26,733
No...! The demon hound...!
It's coming!

153
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:28,108
The what?

154
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:33,983
Sebastian!

155
00:11:37,983 --> 00:11:39,483
What was that thing?

156
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:42,067
Master... look there.

157
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,150
It's the Demon Hound!

158
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:49,150
The Demon Hound is here!

159
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:51,983
Who is it?
Who's the bad dog?

160
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:57,483
Master!

161
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,775
Angela!

162
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:01,692
What's goin' on here?
What's all the fuss about?

163
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:03,108
The Demon Hound is here.

164
00:12:03,192 --> 00:12:04,400
Demon Hound?

165
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:06,900
It brings great catastrophe
to the village....

166
00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:09,358
Anyone who dares
to defy my master...

167
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:11,900
will be punished
by the Demon Hound...

168
00:12:11,983 --> 00:12:14,900
That's the law here.
There is no way to stop it.

169
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,692
Angela.

170
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:22,483
Wake Lord Barrymore at once.
The Demon Hound has come again.

171
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:24,733
Who was the punished one?

172
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,817
How awful.

173
00:12:35,858 --> 00:12:37,358
So that's it then.

174
00:12:37,442 --> 00:12:41,567
Stand back. Don't touch!
I see it was James, then...

175
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,900
He was the bad dog?

176
00:12:42,983 --> 00:12:45,025
Yes... He broke
the legal restriction

177
00:12:45,108 --> 00:12:47,733
on dog ownership...
He had six dogs.

178
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:49,150
One more than is allowed.

179
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:52,483
A sixth dog...
Then this was inevitable.

180
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:54,900
That's all you can say...?!
Really?!

181
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,733
This village is under
my rule and no other.

182
00:12:57,817 --> 00:12:59,983
The Demon Hound
protects that rule...

183
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:01,858
As the guardian of
the Barrymore family,

184
00:13:01,942 --> 00:13:05,233
it punishes anyone and everyone
who dares to challenge me!

185
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:09,067
The white dog is a good dog,
a good dog, good...

186
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,817
The black dog is a bad dog,
a bad dog, bad...

187
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,650
He'll eat your flesh
down to the bone.

188
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:17,900
Down to the bone
He'll gobble you up

189
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:18,650
'til you're gone...

190
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:20,817
'til you're gone

191
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,317
Lullaby, the sun sets...

192
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,025
Lullaby, good night...

193
00:13:24,108 --> 00:13:25,442
The white dog is a--

194
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:28,817
I was sure you outsiders
were going to be its next prey.

195
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,317
You were lucky to have escaped.

196
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:37,775
Well, master?

197
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,108
This has gotta be
the worst holiday ever!

198
00:13:57,192 --> 00:13:59,108
The worst, yes it is.

199
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:00,525
What's the matter?

200
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:03,400
You were so excited
on the way here.

201
00:14:03,483 --> 00:14:05,192
Yeah, well that was before.

202
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:07,983
Don't look so gloomy...
We're on holiday.

203
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:09,858
It's a time meant for relaxing.

204
00:14:17,442 --> 00:14:19,483
Whew...! Ahh!
I haven't been to a proper

205
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,692
swimming hole in ages...!
The water is so nice and warm!

206
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:25,525
Aren't you coming in, Mei-Lin?

207
00:14:25,608 --> 00:14:29,067
No... I can't go out there...!
It's too embarrassing.

208
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,233
Come on, now!
You don't get a chance

209
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:32,817
to do this every day!

210
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:46,692
Oh, this is
absolutely humiliating!

211
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:49,025
No worries, Mei-Lin,
you look lovely!

212
00:14:49,108 --> 00:14:50,525
You aren't just saying that?

213
00:14:50,608 --> 00:14:53,025
I bet you'd look even better
without the glasses!

214
00:14:53,108 --> 00:14:54,608
No, no, no, no!

215
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:57,650
I can't!
The master gave them to me!

216
00:14:59,192 --> 00:15:01,608
Don't you care to bathe
with them young master...?

217
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:04,650
Oh, I see.
Is that the problem?

218
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:06,233
The master cant--

219
00:15:06,317 --> 00:15:08,525
I don't see why they're making
such a fuss about this pond...

220
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:11,400
Just because you can bathe
doesn't make it a resort.

221
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:14,442
You still intend to make
this place into a resort then?

222
00:15:14,525 --> 00:15:15,775
Naturally.

223
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:18,067
But what about this
great Demon Hound?

224
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:20,942
Surely you know
as well as I by now...

225
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:23,192
This Demon Hound is no dog.

226
00:15:24,817 --> 00:15:26,733
Shall we discuss it further?

227
00:15:28,775 --> 00:15:30,775
Hi, Angela!

228
00:15:32,525 --> 00:15:33,858
Now go.

229
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:37,733
Yes...very well, master...
you may consider it done.

230
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:41,025
You're very cooperative...
especially for someone

231
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,442
who hates dogs.

232
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:45,150
Yes... I detest them...
That's why I'd like to finish

233
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:49,192
this as quickly as possible.
Preferably before it

234
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:50,858
all goes to hell.

235
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:56,608
Please help yourself, Angela.

236
00:15:56,692 --> 00:15:58,400
Really?
Are you sure you don't mind

237
00:15:58,483 --> 00:15:59,775
sharing your lunch with me?

238
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,983
Of course not...!
Go on, it's delicious.

239
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:04,108
Sebastian really knows
how to cook!

240
00:16:04,192 --> 00:16:06,358
We caught him!
The bad dog's been caught!

241
00:16:06,442 --> 00:16:08,150
We've got James' dog...!
Hurry!

242
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,567
The punishment
is about to begin!

243
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:19,900
He's got something
in his mouth.

244
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:21,067
Get it from him!

245
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:25,067
Bad dog! Let go!
Bad Dog Give it to me!

246
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,192
Let go...!

247
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:27,442
Let go!

248
00:16:27,525 --> 00:16:30,858
What a bad dog...
He deserves punishment...

249
00:16:30,942 --> 00:16:32,650
Get started!

250
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,692
Stop this...
You can't do it...!

251
00:16:57,775 --> 00:17:00,442
It's awful!

252
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:02,525
Just let the poor thing go!

253
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,525
Stop this now!

254
00:17:14,317 --> 00:17:15,650
Finni!

255
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:21,442
They interfered.

256
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:23,192
They interrupted.

257
00:17:25,025 --> 00:17:26,067
Punish them!

258
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,817
They must be punished...
like bad dogs!

259
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:35,817
Not so powerful now, are you?

260
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,733
Master, I beg you...!
Show mercy this one time...!

261
00:17:38,817 --> 00:17:40,775
These people don't
deserve the punishment!

262
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:43,817
You have a point...
This little Pomeranian

263
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,275
is the queen's guard dog, after
all. If he can be made to see

264
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:50,358
reason, perhaps I'll
decide to let him go.

265
00:17:50,442 --> 00:17:53,483
Leave this village immediately
and advise Her Majesty never to

266
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:55,692
send her minions near it again!

267
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:58,317
You're so pathetic...
You rely on lowly tricks

268
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,483
to retain your meager power.
If there's a stubborn dog here,

269
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:04,942
I'd say I'm looking at him.

270
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:07,650
If that's your final choice...
you can learn what happens

271
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:10,900
to a dog that challenges me!
Get him!

272
00:18:22,692 --> 00:18:23,900
You cut that close.

273
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:26,733
It won't happen again...
Trust me.

274
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:30,608
You dare to interfere, dog?
Well, what are you

275
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,775
mangy mutts waiting for?
Kill both of them now!

276
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:37,150
Shameful...
What coarse, noisy

277
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,442
growls they have.
One of the reasons

278
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:41,733
I despise these creatures.

279
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,650
What the hell...?
What did you do?

280
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:51,692
Your pitiful farce
ends here, Barrymore!

281
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,900
Listen...!
There is no Demon Hound...!

282
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:56,775
It's all a lie...
There's just him...

283
00:18:56,858 --> 00:18:59,567
An old man obsessed with power,
determined to keep it

284
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,817
no matter what.

285
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,108
What evidence do you have?

286
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:04,775
There's this.

287
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:08,942
We found it in your mansion...
I took the liberty of confirming

288
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:12,400
that the teeth marks on James
match the teeth in this skull.

289
00:19:14,525 --> 00:19:17,108
Do you see it now?
The truth behind

290
00:19:17,192 --> 00:19:18,942
the Demon Hound.

291
00:19:20,442 --> 00:19:23,317
Its shadow is nothing
but a projection.

292
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,567
Just a transparent trick.
The glowing is

293
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:31,400
phosphorescent dust...
sprinkled on a normal dog.

294
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:35,900
The Demon Hound is merely
an illusion, a story made up

295
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:39,650
by an evil man...
A man you let rule your village.

296
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:42,317
This man: Henry Barrymore!

297
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,733
No...! It's all nonsense...!
You can't fool them!

298
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,233
Where's your evidence?

299
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,108
You can rest...
Your duty is done.

300
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,817
I'll take it from here.

301
00:19:58,858 --> 00:20:01,692
What fine material...
I wonder why the dog

302
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:04,817
was eager to hold onto it
until the last moment.

303
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,775
Interesting behavior...
Don't you think?

304
00:20:08,858 --> 00:20:10,692
Wha-- what the hell?!

305
00:20:10,775 --> 00:20:13,525
Yours... a scrap of cloth
from your pants...

306
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:16,692
torn off by James' dog
when you attacked his master...

307
00:20:16,775 --> 00:20:18,442
You recognize it? Yes?

308
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:32,150
Give up, Barrymore...!
It's all over now!

309
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:33,025
Punish James' killer...!

310
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,233
No no, please stop!

311
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,442
Punish James' killer!

312
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:47,858
My goodness, I'm glad
that's over, yes I am!

313
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:48,983
Whew!

314
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:54,400
You were one amazing pup...
A loyal dog defending

315
00:20:54,483 --> 00:20:56,942
his master until the very end.

316
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:07,525
You were a good boy...
such a good boy.

317
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:13,692
There you go...
Yet Another reason

318
00:21:13,775 --> 00:21:15,233
that I hate dogs.

319
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:31,567
Yet another case closed, eh?
We can leave the village

320
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,692
when the rain lets up.

321
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:35,442
Indeed.

322
00:21:40,358 --> 00:21:42,317
What's wrong with Angela?

323
00:21:49,192 --> 00:21:52,025
Let me out!
Oh, please...!

324
00:21:52,108 --> 00:21:55,692
It's coming for me!
It's coming...!

325
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:59,067
The Demon Hound...!
It's going to get me,

326
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,275
I know it is!
Please...!

327
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:03,442
Let me go...!

328
00:22:03,525 --> 00:22:05,858
Let me go...!
I begging you!

329
00:22:05,942 --> 00:22:08,692
Please!

330
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:15,817
What the hell is
goin' down there?

331
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,567
Mei-Lin, what's wrong?

332
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:13,650
The howl of a cursed
hound echoes through

333
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:18,608
the desolate village... Ugh...
the infernal beast's smell

334
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:22,400
is clinging to you.
Master... if we're through here,

335
00:24:22,483 --> 00:24:26,067
I think it's time for a bath...
We must soak you in a tub

336
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:33,108
and scrub one hundred times...
One... two... three...

337
00:24:33,192 --> 00:24:35,233
Next time, on Black Butler:

338
00:24:35,317 --> 00:24:37,025
"His Butler, Training."

339
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,608
You see, I am simply
one hell of a butler.
