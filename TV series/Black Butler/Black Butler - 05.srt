1
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:41,233
Is this really the time
for a game of chess?

2
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:46,692
Obsessing about it won't
help you solve the case...

3
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:49,150
Why not just leave it all
to Sebastian, dear?

4
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:52,317
Because he's simply my chess
piece... I'm the one who

5
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,900
moves him by giving orders.
But he's no ordinary piece.

6
00:00:56,983 --> 00:00:59,817
He can move as many squares
as he needs to...

7
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,400
Like that.

8
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:04,900
That was against the rules,
you know.

9
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:08,067
Indeed... It would be
if this was a game...

10
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,317
But rules such as that have no
true meaning in the real world.

11
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,150
There are always knights
who break the rules...

12
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:15,942
and pawns who betray.

13
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:19,858
If you let your guard down...
It's checkmate.

14
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:25,942
You must've had
other options in life...

15
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:28,733
besides policing
England's underworld...

16
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:34,067
I'm sure my sister, your mother,
wanted something else for you.

17
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,150
And yet, after their deaths
you returned to be

18
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:37,900
the queen's guard dog...

19
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:41,025
Is it because you're trying
to avenge your parents' murders?

20
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,275
The need for revenge
is a funny thing...

21
00:03:47,358 --> 00:03:49,150
It won't bring the dead back...

22
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:51,275
nor will it bring
them happiness.

23
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:52,275
But then--

24
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:53,442
To answer your question,

25
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,358
I didn't return to
the house of Phantomhive

26
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:57,067
for my parents.

27
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:01,942
I did it for myself.

28
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:07,525
I want to find the people
responsible for what happened...

29
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:08,942
and I want to
make them experience

30
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:12,900
the same pain and humiliation
that I suffered.

31
00:04:12,983 --> 00:04:15,108
I still remember
when you were born...

32
00:04:15,192 --> 00:04:17,400
though it seems so long ago.

33
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:20,442
You were so tiny and fragile,
I remember thinking...

34
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:23,983
"No matter what,
I have to protect him."

35
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:27,150
You know I was never
able to have children...

36
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,817
But then there was you...

37
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,650
and I've come to think of you
as my own son...

38
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:34,442
which is why I wish
you would quit this.

39
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,775
This is a task
I've freely chosen...

40
00:04:36,858 --> 00:04:40,025
It's still my choice to make...
and no one else's.

41
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:45,400
I don't regret my decision and
I won't be coddled by anyone.

42
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,650
I have it now... thank you.

43
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:52,025
My lady.

44
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:56,817
Promise me... say you'll
never leave his side.

45
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,275
This is a dangerous world
for a boy...

46
00:04:59,358 --> 00:05:01,317
Make sure he doesn't
lose his way?

47
00:05:02,942 --> 00:05:05,150
Fear not... I swear...

48
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:07,650
I shall stay by his side
until the very end.

49
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:13,400
I'm here to escort you
back home... my lady.

50
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:22,900
Well, then?

51
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:27,400
No matter how I look at it,
the result is still the same.

52
00:05:27,483 --> 00:05:30,442
Yesterday's murder...
the viscount didn't do it.

53
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:33,650
Exactly... none of the people
in his mansion could have

54
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:34,942
done it either.

55
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:38,733
Indeed... No person could
move that quickly...

56
00:05:38,817 --> 00:05:41,108
Anyway, tomorrow we'll start--

57
00:05:42,692 --> 00:05:45,858
Sebastian... ! You didn't....?

58
00:05:45,942 --> 00:05:49,942
Of course I didn't, my lord...
I told you, I never lie...

59
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:54,650
Now... Involved in medicine...
ties to secret societies

60
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:57,775
or black magic...
lacking alibis for the nights

61
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,900
the bodies were found...

62
00:05:59,983 --> 00:06:03,817
The only human who fits our
criteria is the Viscount Druit.

63
00:06:04,608 --> 00:06:07,608
You know more about this than
you're letting on, don't you?

64
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:10,150
But I'm simply
one hell of a butler...

65
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:12,900
As you well know, I only
carry out those orders

66
00:06:12,983 --> 00:06:15,192
my master has
directly given me.

67
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:20,025
You need only say
the words, my lord...

68
00:06:20,108 --> 00:06:23,525
and I become either your pawn...
or your knight.

69
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:27,650
Now... master...
move me to check.

70
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:37,525
He'll show if we stake out
this place, right?

71
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:38,858
Yes.

72
00:06:38,942 --> 00:06:41,733
You know... I've realized
the murdered prostitutes

73
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:44,817
had other things in common
besides their profession.

74
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,567
The most beautiful,
glossy black hair.

75
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,525
But I still don't understand
why he had to kill them all.

76
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:53,692
So very lovable...
it could almost be a sin.

77
00:06:53,775 --> 00:06:54,775
And what's more, I--

78
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:57,775
So soft... Ah, so soft...

79
00:06:58,817 --> 00:07:00,275
Listen when I'm talking to you!

80
00:07:00,358 --> 00:07:04,900
Oh... I apologize, sir, but
she's so beautiful... and soft.

81
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,733
How could somebody
have gotten past us?

82
00:07:09,817 --> 00:07:11,025
Let's go, sir.

83
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,858
Come away!

84
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:43,608
You've made quite a bloody mess
of things in there...

85
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:48,067
Jack the Ripper...
or, rather...

86
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,775
Grell Sutcliffe.

87
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:52,275
No... ! No, you're wrong... !

88
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:56,150
I...I heard the scream
and rushed to help... but...

89
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:59,608
You can drop
the innocent act, Grell...

90
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:03,108
It's over. You know, this
is actually the first time

91
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:06,192
I've met someone like you
in the human world.

92
00:08:06,275 --> 00:08:08,942
You played the role
of helpless butler well...

93
00:08:10,275 --> 00:08:14,150
Your act had almost everybody
completely fooled.

94
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:17,025
You... you think so?

95
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,108
How... kind!

96
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:27,900
That's great to hear.
After all... I am an actress.

97
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:29,858
And quite a good one at that.

98
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:36,442
Of course... you're not really
"Sebastian" either, are you?

99
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:38,942
Sebastian is the name
my master gave me...

100
00:08:39,025 --> 00:08:42,025
So that is who I am...
for now.

101
00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:44,650
Ah... you're playing
the faithful dog...

102
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,650
Well, you're handsome enough
to get away with it.

103
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:51,275
Anyway, here we are
Sebastian... No...

104
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:55,067
I'll call you Bassy.
Let me introduce myself...

105
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,608
The Burnett butler, Grell
Sutcliff... What do you say... ?

106
00:08:58,692 --> 00:08:59,942
Let's get along!

107
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:04,775
Ah, it's so nice to
talk to you in my true form!

108
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:07,358
I admit I was surprised
when I first met you.

109
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:09,733
I've never seen
a demon playing a butler!

110
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:12,025
But I could say
the same about you...

111
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:13,900
I never thought I'd
find one of your kind

112
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,400
playing a butler either.

113
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:17,150
You're supposed to be
an intermediary

114
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:18,900
between man and god.

115
00:09:20,608 --> 00:09:22,608
A grim reaper.

116
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:25,108
Why would a divine being
like you pretend to be

117
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:26,442
a servant?

118
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:29,233
Why, indeed... for now
let's just say that it was

119
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:31,192
out of love for
a certain woman.

120
00:09:32,608 --> 00:09:34,108
And that woman would be?

121
00:09:34,192 --> 00:09:37,275
You don't really
need to ask, do you?

122
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:48,983
Madam...

123
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:51,067
Well, I hadn't
counted on this...

124
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,150
I didn't think anyone would be
able to see who Grell truly is.

125
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:57,025
Naturally, you were
on the suspect list

126
00:09:57,108 --> 00:09:58,483
from the very beginning.

127
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:01,525
But all of your alibis
seemed flawless.

128
00:10:01,608 --> 00:10:04,400
You mean you actually
suspected your own aunt?

129
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:06,275
I was looking
for a murderer...

130
00:10:06,358 --> 00:10:09,192
Degree of relation to me
didn't matter.

131
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,067
None of the humans
on the suspect list

132
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,692
could have been responsible
for all the murders...

133
00:10:13,775 --> 00:10:16,400
but if one had
an inhuman accomplice,

134
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,692
that would change
the game completely.

135
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:21,358
It had to be someone who
could enter and leave a room

136
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:23,442
without being noticed,
someone who could

137
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:25,692
travel from the viscount's
home to the East End

138
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:27,525
instantaneously...

139
00:10:28,483 --> 00:10:30,358
In the end, you two
were the only ones who

140
00:10:30,442 --> 00:10:32,567
could be Jack the Ripper...

141
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,358
You, Madam Red...
and Grell Sutcliffe.

142
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:38,692
I began to look into
what else the victims had

143
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:42,192
in common besides
prostitution... and then...

144
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,983
I noticed they'd all undergone a
certain surgery at the hospital

145
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:46,525
where you work...

146
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:48,400
We made a list of
all the patients...

147
00:10:48,483 --> 00:10:51,108
One... the only one
who was still alive...

148
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,650
was a woman by the name
of Mary Kelly.

149
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:55,358
We knew if we waited
around here,

150
00:10:55,442 --> 00:10:57,317
you would
come for her eventually.

151
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:02,900
But we were... too late.

152
00:11:02,983 --> 00:11:06,567
My darling nephew, how
unfortunate this turned out

153
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:11,817
to be. If you had let it go, we
could have played chess again.

154
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:16,525
But now...
You've taken everything!

155
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:26,150
What... is that?!

156
00:11:28,108 --> 00:11:31,317
Grim reapers use tools
for harvesting souls...

157
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,733
that is his reaper's scythe.

158
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:35,733
Don't you dare call it that!
This is so much more

159
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:36,733
than a scythe!

160
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:38,567
I worked very hard
to customize it.

161
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,525
This is a special death scythe
of my own design...

162
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:45,858
It can hack anyone into tiny
pieces. I've been far too

163
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:49,483
well behaved. I'm getting out
of shape. I would love to

164
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:54,233
exercise my skills.
So... shall... we... play?

165
00:11:54,317 --> 00:11:57,025
Perhaps you could be a bit more
respectful of my position... ?

166
00:11:57,108 --> 00:11:58,650
I'm on duty, after all.

167
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:00,317
What a stoic man you are!

168
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,733
That makes you
even more irresistible.

169
00:12:03,608 --> 00:12:06,775
You know, red is
my favorite color.

170
00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:10,400
It's perfect for hair...
for clothes... for lipstick...

171
00:12:10,483 --> 00:12:16,733
So I painted all those women
with pretty, pretty red blood.

172
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:19,775
So, Bassy, now I'll
make you even better looking

173
00:12:19,858 --> 00:12:23,192
than you are. I'll tear
you up from the inside

174
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,525
...and trust me
I'll make you like it.

175
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:28,317
You'll be as lovely
as scattered rose petals.

176
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,025
You're a grim reaper...

177
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:33,858
Your job is to quietly harvest
the souls of the dying.

178
00:12:33,942 --> 00:12:36,108
And as a butler, your job
is to follow your master

179
00:12:36,192 --> 00:12:37,567
like a shadow.

180
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:41,150
You have violated both
of these expectations...

181
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:44,817
And, quite frankly,
I find it sickening.

182
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,983
Bassy... you wound me.

183
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:51,275
You know... I'm more deadly
efficient than I seem.

184
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:57,900
In my name and that of the
queen, I order you, Sebastian...

185
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,275
Put an end to them.

186
00:13:02,358 --> 00:13:04,900
Indeed... my young lord.

187
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:24,483
Oooh...! Yes! Please, run
away...! We can play tag, Bassy!

188
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:43,233
But see what happens if you're
not fast enough? You get cut.

189
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,192
It's more fun when it hurts
a little bit though isn't it?

190
00:13:48,275 --> 00:13:51,525
You're still the queen's guard
dog... which means that now,

191
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:52,775
I'm your prey.

192
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:54,942
But if it's hunt or be hunted...

193
00:13:55,983 --> 00:13:57,983
There's only
one thing I can do!

194
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,108
You're a doctor.
How could you do it?!

195
00:14:04,192 --> 00:14:08,608
You wouldn't understand if I
told you! You're just a child!

196
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,150
You...

197
00:14:15,317 --> 00:14:16,525
You brat...

198
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,358
You shouldn't have been born
in the first place!

199
00:14:27,108 --> 00:14:28,275
Sister...

200
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:30,108
Master!

201
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:35,233
Stop, Sebastian!
Don't kill her!

202
00:14:45,942 --> 00:14:48,483
Your arm...

203
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:52,900
How sweet you are, Bassy...
Really, what a prince!

204
00:14:52,983 --> 00:14:57,317
Sacrificing your own poor
limb to save that kid.

205
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,108
On the other hand, you're
a disappointment, Madam...

206
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:03,608
Come now... Hurry up
and kill the brat already.

207
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:21,483
I loved my sister. I loved her
husband. I loved their child.

208
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:26,692
I can't.

209
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:31,317
I can't kill him... I can't
kill their beloved son.

210
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,733
Really? You're getting
soft-hearted on me all of

211
00:15:33,817 --> 00:15:37,650
a sudden? After all those
deaths? If you don't end him,

212
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:39,025
he'll end you.

213
00:15:39,108 --> 00:15:40,567
Madam...

214
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:44,317
But... This dear boy...

215
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,692
This child is my--

216
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,275
Too late for that...!
How disappointing.

217
00:15:52,358 --> 00:15:55,358
What use do I have for you
if you're just another woman?!

218
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:05,275
Is that her--?

219
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:08,317
A part of the reapers' job
is to replay and examine

220
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,192
the memories of those
who are on the To-Die list.

221
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:14,025
From that we determine what
kind of person they were...

222
00:16:14,108 --> 00:16:16,650
We see from their own
perspective what kind of life

223
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:20,775
they've lived. And we decide
whether they should live or die.

224
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:23,692
Their lives flash...
right before their eyes.

225
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:27,192
Ugh, please, that's such
a pedestrian term!

226
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:31,483
It is so much more than that.
This is the reaper's true power.

227
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:34,025
The Cinematic Record.

228
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:37,567
Rachel...

229
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:41,608
Angelina come say hello to our
guest, Lord Phantomhive.

230
00:16:43,858 --> 00:16:47,608
I had hated the red hair
I'd inherited from my father.

231
00:16:47,692 --> 00:16:49,733
Your hair is
very beautiful, An.

232
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:56,067
The color of spider lilies.
Red suits you very well.

233
00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:01,692
But I came to love it after all.
I came to love the color red...

234
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:03,733
I came to love him.

235
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:06,608
Ann, I have wonderful news!

236
00:17:08,983 --> 00:17:10,400
My sister...

237
00:17:12,025 --> 00:17:15,608
Once again...
I hated the color red.

238
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:20,192
But...I could never
bring myself to hate them.

239
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:25,942
Eventually, I, too,
met a man and got married.

240
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:29,317
What do you think?
A boy or a girl?

241
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,108
Men are so impatient...
How would I know that yet?

242
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:37,400
It didn't happen at all
in the way I'd wanted it to...

243
00:17:37,483 --> 00:17:41,442
But still, I thought
I'd found happiness.

244
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:47,192
That carriage hit someone...!
Call a doctor, quickly!

245
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,608
Then it all slipped away.

246
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:52,817
Your husband died
instantly... and in order

247
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,483
to save your life... We were
forced to remove your uterus...

248
00:17:56,567 --> 00:18:00,275
and your unborn child
with it... I'm sorry,

249
00:18:00,358 --> 00:18:02,025
but we had no choice.

250
00:18:02,108 --> 00:18:06,067
Everything... everything
slipped away from me.

251
00:18:08,358 --> 00:18:10,608
I lost the man
I had learned to love.

252
00:18:10,692 --> 00:18:14,608
And the child I loved so dearly
before it was even born.

253
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:19,775
The stain spread.

254
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:25,108
It covered everything...
That color I so hated...

255
00:18:25,192 --> 00:18:26,942
The color red.

256
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:34,150
My sister was buried
with the man she loved...

257
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:39,025
If only... if only my heart
had been buried in the ground

258
00:18:39,108 --> 00:18:40,483
along with them.

259
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:46,275
Honestly, a child
would only be in the way.

260
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,400
I don't know who the father is,
and my customers wouldn't

261
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:51,192
like a child hanging around.

262
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:54,817
I had lost everything in my
life. That woman had what

263
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,567
I wanted most... What I
would never get the chance

264
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:04,358
to have again. And she threw it
away without a second thought.

265
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:08,692
I wanted to stain her, too.

266
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:14,692
Hello... you're that doct--
Wha- What are you doing... ?

267
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:16,650
No... ! No, wai--!

268
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:22,775
I decided to stain everything
red... with my own hands.

269
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:29,275
My, my... ! That was
quite a little show!

270
00:19:32,817 --> 00:19:36,942
That's when I met
my blood-red grim reaper.

271
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:41,442
A few months later... my missing
nephew suddenly reappeared.

272
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:44,483
Oh, Ciel!

273
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:50,608
With him he brought
a butler dressed in black.

274
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:52,942
You're really safe.

275
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,317
I got at least one thing back.

276
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Thank goodness...
At least we still have you...

277
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:02,108
Let me take a look
at your darling face.

278
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:06,942
The child of the man I loved...
and my sister.

279
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:14,650
If this child could come back
then why couldn't my beloved?

280
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:17,900
Why wasn't I the one
he chose to marry... ?

281
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:21,025
I finally decided that
I would right all the wrongs

282
00:20:21,108 --> 00:20:22,525
I had been dealt.

283
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:25,025
You've taken everything!

284
00:20:37,692 --> 00:20:40,192
How beautiful you were
dyed crimson, covered in

285
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:43,275
your victims' blood...
I loved you so.

286
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,650
What a disappointment you
turned out to be in the end.

287
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:52,692
You don't have what
it takes to wear red.

288
00:20:52,775 --> 00:20:56,275
Your cheap little
melodrama ends now.

289
00:20:56,358 --> 00:21:00,108
It's... over,
Madam Red... Goodbye.

290
00:21:09,525 --> 00:21:11,442
Well, what are you waiting for?

291
00:21:12,692 --> 00:21:16,192
I thought I ordered you to
put an end to Jack the Ripper.

292
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,192
It's not over yet.

293
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:23,525
One is left... Stop standing
there and kill him!

294
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:28,108
Certainly.

295
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,983
I was going to spare you...

296
00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:33,442
Professional courtesy and all
that... but if you insist...

297
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:38,275
I'll send you and the boy
to Heaven together!

298
00:21:38,358 --> 00:21:40,150
Heaven? You're joking.

299
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,400
I know nothing of Heaven.

300
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:52,608
You would kick
a lady in the face?!

301
00:21:52,692 --> 00:21:54,525
Where are your manners, sir?!

302
00:21:54,608 --> 00:21:58,983
Terribly sorry... You see, I'm
simply one hell of a butler.

303
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:03,108
You think a demon like you
can beat a reaper?

304
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:07,983
Certainly... You see if
my master tells me to win...

305
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:09,608
then I shall win.

306
00:22:09,692 --> 00:22:12,567
You care a lot about that
puny little brat, don't you...?

307
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,108
I'm jealous.

308
00:22:14,192 --> 00:22:17,442
Demon or not, you'll still
be destroyed if I reap you

309
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:21,358
with my death scythe...
Aren't you frightened?

310
00:22:21,442 --> 00:22:25,150
Not at all...
I belong to my master...

311
00:22:25,233 --> 00:22:30,025
My soul and my body, down to
the last hair, are his.

312
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:34,650
The contract remains... so
I follow his every order...

313
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:37,025
That's what it means
to be a butler.

314
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:14,650
The red spider lilies
blazing in the fields...

315
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:18,025
the red cardinal singing in the
trees... all must eventually

316
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:23,650
wither and die... falling prey
to the deadly laws of nature.

317
00:24:23,733 --> 00:24:26,150
Please excuse me...
I cannot allow myself to be

318
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:27,983
affected by such vulgarity...

319
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:31,983
I shall have to dispatch him
in a deadly efficient way.

320
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:34,525
Next time, on Black Butler...

321
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:36,608
"His Butler, At the Funeral."

322
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:39,775
You see, I am simply
one hell of a butler.
