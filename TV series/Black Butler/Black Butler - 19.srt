1
00:00:22,817 --> 00:00:24,358
Believe it or not...

2
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:26,150
T'weren't so long ago
people could bathe

3
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:27,983
in this 'ere river.

4
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:31,817
Might as well be
a sewer now, though,

5
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,525
what with the filth
all of London has poured

6
00:00:33,608 --> 00:00:35,733
into it these past years.

7
00:00:35,817 --> 00:00:38,108
Mr. Havock, look there...!
What's that?

8
00:00:39,817 --> 00:00:43,025
Oh, aye... That
there is Cutty Sark.

9
00:00:43,108 --> 00:00:45,733
They say she was built
to import tea from China,

10
00:00:45,817 --> 00:00:48,900
for the nobles and such -
like who could afford it.

11
00:00:49,858 --> 00:00:51,775
Is she faster
than a steamship?

12
00:00:51,858 --> 00:00:54,567
Heh... F'you listen to
the crew what sails her,

13
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,692
with a stout wind she can
beat anything that floats.

14
00:00:57,775 --> 00:00:59,483
Why is she the "Cutty Sark?"

15
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:03,358
Old Bobbie Burns tells of a
witch by that name, my boy.

16
00:01:03,442 --> 00:01:05,025
Says if you stare
at her too long,

17
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:06,858
she'll have you by the tail.

18
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,983
She could take me
away from here...

19
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:12,442
Some place that no one's
ever heard of...

20
00:01:12,525 --> 00:01:13,858
Could be...

21
00:01:13,942 --> 00:01:16,525
But that new canal in Egypt's
clipped her wings a bit.

22
00:01:16,608 --> 00:01:19,775
Put her out of the tea trade
for good, so I hear.

23
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:24,942
The age of the clippers
is over, I'm afraid...

24
00:01:25,025 --> 00:01:27,650
It's the beginning
of a new era now.

25
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,233
That's her...! Cutty Sark!

26
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:45,858
What is it, boy?

27
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,025
We haven't been able
to find anyone who

28
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:31,692
can identify him, inspector.

29
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:32,942
I see.

30
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:34,775
Simple robbery, then...

31
00:03:34,858 --> 00:03:37,692
He was murdered elsewhere
and then dropped here...

32
00:03:37,775 --> 00:03:39,608
not much left for us to do.

33
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:41,067
But see here?

34
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,567
The victim was killed by a
single, well placed blow...

35
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,275
That seems a bit neat
for a common thief

36
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,817
if you want my opinion, sir.

37
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,817
Perhaps there's some sort of
Mafia infighting going on, then.

38
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,025
Who knows what the Italians
and Chinese are up to...

39
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,358
I've heard tales of
a new drug on the market.

40
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:57,775
That could cause
some territory dispute...

41
00:03:57,858 --> 00:04:01,150
Doesn't matter. Won't know
anything 'til he's identified.

42
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:03,983
That won't be necessary.
We know his identity.

43
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:05,608
His name is John Stanley...

44
00:04:05,692 --> 00:04:08,525
Sebastian has the rest
of his particulars for you.

45
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:10,942
Inspector.

46
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:15,150
And what is
your interest in this?

47
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:17,983
Doing my civic duty and
cooperating with the police...

48
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:19,858
Isn't that what you've
always told me to do,

49
00:04:19,942 --> 00:04:20,900
Sir Arthur?

50
00:04:20,983 --> 00:04:23,150
Spare me the
noble protestations...

51
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:25,025
What is it you want
with this case...?

52
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:26,650
Out with it,
Phantomhive.

53
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,025
A bit gauche, but if
you prefer it that way...

54
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:30,442
I'm happy to oblige...

55
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:34,275
I need to see any belongings
left on the victim.

56
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,942
Well... Actually
there were none.

57
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:39,692
Not even any
identification papers.

58
00:04:42,192 --> 00:04:44,900
In that case... I'm happy
I could be of service...

59
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:48,025
Thank you, Inspector Abberline.

60
00:04:48,108 --> 00:04:49,358
Sebastian.

61
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:51,025
Sir.

62
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:52,692
Nosy brat...

63
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:56,900
I'll never understand why Her
Majesty puts her trust in him.

64
00:04:56,983 --> 00:04:59,567
Because he's
her guard dog... Sir.

65
00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:04,817
Is something wrong,
my lord...?

66
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,983
I must say you seem
even more taciturn

67
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:08,942
than usual this afternoon.

68
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:11,608
And I should look pleasant
while investigating a murder?

69
00:05:11,692 --> 00:05:14,567
You're far too modest, sir...
You misheard me...

70
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,900
I would never say that
you don't look pleasant.

71
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:20,233
This case just makes me
a bit uneasy...

72
00:05:20,317 --> 00:05:22,775
Clearly we don't have
all the information.

73
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,067
This morning a body
washed up at the

74
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,025
Regent's Canal Dock... The
man's name was John Stanley...

75
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:34,442
by profession he was a merchant
in the shipping business.

76
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:35,608
And?

77
00:05:36,942 --> 00:05:39,358
He was an operative in
the criminal underworld,

78
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:42,317
on top-secret assignment
for Her Majesty.

79
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,942
Not unlike you,
Lord Phantomhive.

80
00:05:46,108 --> 00:05:48,650
Her Majesty wished me
to convey this:

81
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:52,692
"Find the thing he carried on
his person, and destroy it..."

82
00:05:52,775 --> 00:05:55,858
That is all.
Think you're up to it?

83
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:58,608
And his killer...
shall I get rid of him too?

84
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,358
No... You've been
given your orders...

85
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:04,358
Find this object...
and dispose of it.

86
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,650
Fine... Just tell me what
I should be looking for.

87
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:10,608
Oh, no... That's a secret.

88
00:06:10,692 --> 00:06:13,150
Then how on earth
am I supposed to find it?

89
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:19,900
You're a loyal dog... Even so,

90
00:06:19,983 --> 00:06:22,358
Her Majesty hesitates to
share this bit of information

91
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:27,400
with you... And who are we to
question any decision of hers?

92
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,358
I suggest you do not attempt
a closer examination

93
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:34,317
of the item in question.

94
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:39,233
First, we need a better
understanding of the situation.

95
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:41,192
Meaning what, precisely, sir?

96
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:44,358
We need to know why Stanley
was murdered, obviously.

97
00:06:44,442 --> 00:06:45,942
Was it simply that he was
in the wrong place

98
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:47,858
at the wrong time...?

99
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:51,692
Or was he killed as a result
of his work for the Queen.

100
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:55,608
Alright then, how do we go
about locating witnesses?

101
00:06:55,692 --> 00:06:57,442
Assuming there are any.

102
00:06:57,525 --> 00:06:59,567
We'll leave that part
to the Yard for now...

103
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,400
If you want to know about
Rome, you ask a Roman.

104
00:07:02,483 --> 00:07:05,608
We know in whose territory
the murder occurred.

105
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:13,692
This place is foul.

106
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:17,525
I see you've finally
found your way

107
00:07:17,608 --> 00:07:20,150
to my humble place of business.

108
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:21,942
It feels so strange that
we should meet under

109
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,192
such questionable
circumstances, my young lord.

110
00:07:25,275 --> 00:07:27,608
And yet, inevitable,
don't you think...?

111
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:31,608
I must say, I always knew
someday it might come to this.

112
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:33,067
It might come to what??

113
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,442
Welcome...! to my humble
House of Pleasures...

114
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:37,067
darling Earl.

115
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,442
If you're trying to push
your wares... forget it...

116
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,442
The only thing you have
that I want is information.

117
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:44,983
So impatient for
such a young man...

118
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:46,942
If you think I know
something that would make it

119
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:48,817
worth your while to
venture so bravely

120
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,233
into my den of sin...
then you're quite right...

121
00:07:53,317 --> 00:07:55,108
So you've already heard
what happened, then...

122
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:57,317
I thought as much...
But what should I expect

123
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,692
from the head of
the English branch

124
00:07:58,775 --> 00:08:01,358
of the Chinese trading
company... Kunlun?

125
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:04,733
Much less from an officer of the
Shanghai Mafia's "Green Gang."

126
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,025
Oh dear, I never have
cared for fancy titles

127
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:09,775
such as that one...
They're so stiff and formal...

128
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:12,442
Don't you agree? Ran Mao?

129
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,358
I left you in charge of
the dealings in this area

130
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:15,692
for a reason... So...

131
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:18,317
I assumed you'd stay
informed about any disputes

132
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,817
that occurred
in your territory.

133
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,025
Naturally...

134
00:08:21,108 --> 00:08:24,108
As per your original
instructions, my lord...

135
00:08:24,192 --> 00:08:26,150
I could hardly forget about
the "protection fee"

136
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:28,900
I pay in order to be allowed
to conduct my business.

137
00:08:28,983 --> 00:08:30,233
Well, then?

138
00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:33,858
More importantly... I have
something to ask you.

139
00:08:33,942 --> 00:08:35,942
What exactly are you
talking about?

140
00:08:36,858 --> 00:08:38,775
Damn it, Lau!

141
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:39,942
Just talking through
his hat again,

142
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:42,150
it would seem...
How droll.

143
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:45,525
What do you say we go upstairs
for our little chat...?

144
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,150
It's a little bit stuffy
in here, don't you agree?

145
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:50,483
Perhaps if you found
another source of income...

146
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:53,067
you wouldn't have that
problem quite as often.

147
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,400
"One night, Zhuang Zhou
dreamed he was a butterfly...

148
00:08:56,483 --> 00:08:58,525
a happily fluttering
butterfly..."

149
00:08:58,608 --> 00:09:00,150
You know the rest.

150
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:02,692
There are people in this
world... lord Phantomhive...

151
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,483
Who find reality a bitter, and
unforgiving place to live,

152
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:08,358
if you can believe it.
I merely sell them dreams

153
00:09:08,442 --> 00:09:11,108
of a less painful existence.

154
00:09:12,942 --> 00:09:14,317
You know I'd help you
if I could, dearie,

155
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,358
but I'm afraid I've never
seen that fellow before

156
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:18,775
in my life.
God rest his soul.

157
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,817
Now, enough
about business.

158
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,358
How are you and Maria
doing these days?

159
00:09:24,442 --> 00:09:27,858
Oh... Well, Ma'am...
Actually...

160
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,942
Goodness! Aren't you a quick
one! oh Congratulations!

161
00:09:34,025 --> 00:09:35,817
Putting that horse
a bit before the cart...

162
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,067
but I suppose I understand...
Not everyone will, mind,

163
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,233
you being an inspector and all.

164
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:43,400
Best make an
honest woman of her soon.

165
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,567
Yes, ma'am,
I've already proposed.

166
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,275
And she said?

167
00:09:47,358 --> 00:09:50,525
Wonderful news...!
You'll finally have a family...

168
00:09:50,608 --> 00:09:52,692
After all those years as
an orphan with no kin

169
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:55,567
to call your own,
you must be overjoyed.

170
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,775
Thank you, ma'am.
And you're right.

171
00:09:57,858 --> 00:10:02,233
That has affected my life.
That's why I'm determined...

172
00:10:02,317 --> 00:10:05,567
to make the world safe
for children everywhere.

173
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,442
Oh, enough...
You'll make me cry... Now go.

174
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,192
I'll let you know if
I hear anything new, I promise.

175
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:13,692
Thank you, ma'am...
I would appreciate it.

176
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,775
Let's see... Nowadays,
I suppose all the gang fights

177
00:10:18,858 --> 00:10:21,567
in the area have been
about drugs.

178
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,775
There's a new product that's
appeared on the market...

179
00:10:23,858 --> 00:10:25,483
Somebody's been spreading
it around town

180
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:27,650
quite liberally
for a while now...

181
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:31,025
Frankly, it's becoming a bit
of an inconvenience for me.

182
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:32,317
A new product?

183
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,317
Yes... Apparently it is
cheaper, more effective,

184
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,733
and far easier
to transport than

185
00:10:36,817 --> 00:10:38,233
common opium...

186
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:40,442
It goes by the name
of "Lady Blanc."

187
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:41,692
The white lady...?

188
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:44,275
Do you know why it was
given that name?

189
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:48,483
Is it important?

190
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:49,567
No...

191
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,900
What's the name of
the man they found

192
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,608
at the Regent's Canal Dock...?

193
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:54,400
Perhaps I will have
heard of him.

194
00:10:54,483 --> 00:10:56,275
It was John Stanley...

195
00:10:56,358 --> 00:10:59,275
I'm afraid it's likely that
was an alias, however.

196
00:11:00,483 --> 00:11:02,692
He doesn't look
familiar to me...

197
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:04,983
And to think I flattered
myself I knew all the

198
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:07,150
small time drug pushers
in the area...

199
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,442
What about you...?
You recognize him?

200
00:11:10,525 --> 00:11:11,983
Well, there you have it.

201
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:13,942
I'm looking for something this
man was supposed to've had.

202
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:16,108
He was carrying it
on his person.

203
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:17,608
Just "something?"

204
00:11:17,692 --> 00:11:19,858
Yes... And it's possible this
'something' is the reason

205
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:22,900
he was killed in cold
blood... which is why...

206
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:25,192
there's something I'd
like you to do for me.

207
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:27,358
And what is that...?
My dear Earl.

208
00:11:27,442 --> 00:11:29,192
I want you to spread
a rumor about me...

209
00:11:29,275 --> 00:11:30,900
Let it be known that
I'm in possession

210
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:32,942
of something valuable
I took from the man

211
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,817
who was murdered.

212
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,817
Darling, that couldn't
be easier...

213
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,525
And may I be permitted
to know why?

214
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:41,442
If we spread that rumor
far enough,

215
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:43,650
the killer is sure to hear
it... and he'll have to doubt

216
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:45,317
the authenticity of
the article he stole

217
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,733
from John Stanley...

218
00:11:46,817 --> 00:11:48,567
Then he'll be forced
to come after me for

219
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,900
the real thing.

220
00:11:50,983 --> 00:11:53,525
Oh, I see... You're
using yourself as bait,

221
00:11:53,608 --> 00:11:56,317
you clever thing, you...
A courageous act, indeed,

222
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,608
from the Queen's
loyal guard dog.

223
00:11:59,858 --> 00:12:01,317
Speaking of which, my lord...

224
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,067
I've always wanted to
inquire about something...

225
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,483
How is it that you
remain so loyal to

226
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:07,150
your lord and master?

227
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:09,400
It seems to me she makes
unreasonable demands

228
00:12:09,483 --> 00:12:10,567
of you.

229
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,692
I doubt you could
ever understand it.

230
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,483
You left your country
for another...

231
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,650
If you never put down roots,
you couldn't possibly

232
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:19,692
comprehend the depths
of mine, Lau.

233
00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:20,983
You've got me there.

234
00:12:26,483 --> 00:12:27,733
Now then, Cáo...

235
00:12:27,817 --> 00:12:29,858
Let's do as the Earl
requested, shall we...?

236
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:32,317
and dangle a few little
rumors about him... So...

237
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,150
It seems he obtained
a document from

238
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:37,108
the dead man they found at
the Regent's Canal Dock.

239
00:12:37,192 --> 00:12:39,108
A document, sir?

240
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,358
My dear Earl...

241
00:12:40,442 --> 00:12:42,192
Of all the lovely games
we've played together

242
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:44,025
over the years,
this one may just prove

243
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:46,442
to be the most entertaining.

244
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:06,483
Hello there... young man.

245
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:08,817
Just now... I was talking
to my good friend,

246
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,942
Mr. Havock...

247
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:11,650
He said... you were
collecting rubbish

248
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:13,400
from the Canal
this morning and you saw

249
00:13:13,483 --> 00:13:14,858
something odd.

250
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:16,358
Yeah...

251
00:13:16,442 --> 00:13:18,567
Why don't you tell me?
I love a good story...

252
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,942
Especially one
about witches...

253
00:13:21,025 --> 00:13:23,275
Did you really see the
"Cutty Sark."

254
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,275
Here we go!

255
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:40,650
Alright... I think
that'll do us.

256
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:42,108
Perfect. I've got it...

257
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:44,025
Oh, Mey Rin, I've been
meaning to ask,

258
00:13:44,108 --> 00:13:46,150
you work at the
Phantomhive manor right?

259
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:47,900
Yes, I do...

260
00:13:47,983 --> 00:13:50,525
Do you... think you
can get me some?

261
00:13:50,608 --> 00:13:52,192
Some what?

262
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:55,192
Lady Blanc... Sebastian...

263
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:57,942
do you think the drug is named
after the woman in white

264
00:13:58,025 --> 00:13:59,442
from the last case?

265
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:01,775
You're quite like a little
lost puppy sometimes...

266
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:03,358
You know that, don't you?

267
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:06,442
I may be one hell of
a good playing piece

268
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:07,817
to maneuver...

269
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,733
but I am still merely
a pawn in your game...

270
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:13,858
Would you ask a pawn
for advice on strategy?

271
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:16,317
I'm still alive, which can
mean one thing...

272
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,483
My wish is unfulfilled,
and our contract is in

273
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:19,775
full effect.

274
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:22,108
Yes, my lord... That's true.

275
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:23,900
In the meanwhile,
I will play the guard dog

276
00:14:23,983 --> 00:14:27,442
like the Queen requests,
as so many have before...

277
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:30,108
As the Phantomhive heir,
it is my duty...

278
00:14:30,192 --> 00:14:33,692
To follow in the footsteps
of my ancestors.

279
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:36,483
Yes... Just as
it's always been...

280
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:40,608
Nothing has changed at all...
Except this feeling.

281
00:14:43,608 --> 00:14:45,900
Bad dog... No, get off me!!

282
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:48,400
Stupid mutt...! Let 'er go!

283
00:14:48,483 --> 00:14:50,150
Pluto, you bad boy! No!

284
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:52,733
I said let go, you rabid cur!

285
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:56,400
Sebastian...! Do something
about that horrid creature.

286
00:14:56,483 --> 00:14:57,900
Certainly.

287
00:14:57,983 --> 00:15:00,525
Pluto... Kennel.

288
00:15:06,275 --> 00:15:08,775
Can anyone tell me
what that was all about?

289
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:10,775
Can't be certain,
but maybe he's rutting.

290
00:15:10,858 --> 00:15:11,983
Rutting after me?!

291
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:14,025
Was it me, or did he
seem to be concentrating

292
00:15:14,108 --> 00:15:17,317
rather intensely on what
Mey Rin has in her pocket?

293
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,150
Oh...! Did he now?

294
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:23,900
Well that's it...!

295
00:15:23,983 --> 00:15:26,442
You've got one of the
Funtom candies on you!

296
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,900
Forgot about this...
A nice lady gave it to me,

297
00:15:28,983 --> 00:15:30,233
yes she did...

298
00:15:30,317 --> 00:15:32,608
Said they're becoming
the rage all over London.

299
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:34,942
When we said we'd never
tried one, she insisted...

300
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:37,567
She was a really nice
lady, right Mey Rin...?

301
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,900
Said we had to try
one for ourselves...

302
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:43,067
Apparently they're so good,
even adults can't get enough...

303
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,942
And they make you
feel wonderful all over!

304
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:47,942
She says it's addicting!

305
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:49,608
Well... give us a ta--

306
00:15:49,692 --> 00:15:51,442
Hold on just a minute!

307
00:15:54,858 --> 00:15:57,858
Lord Phantomhive...
I think it is fairly safe to say

308
00:15:57,942 --> 00:16:00,483
this sweet was not made
by the Funtom company.

309
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:01,817
It wasn't?

310
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,400
This wrapper is genuine...
but our quality control

311
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:07,067
is not so lax as to permit
a shipment of candies

312
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,567
so unshapely. I guarantee
you that, my lord.

313
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:13,442
This is...

314
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:18,692
Oh no! He ran out of time!

315
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:28,150
It's some kind of narcotic.
I believe it is derived

316
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:32,567
from opium. Perhaps
further refined, however.

317
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:36,192
I assume this is the
new drug Mr. Lau spoke of.

318
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:37,817
We've found Lady Blanc.

319
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:41,358
A visitor...? To see me?

320
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:44,567
You there! Get up...!

321
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,567
What are you doing
in my chair, sir...?

322
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,650
This is the outside of enough!
That desk is reserved

323
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:51,942
for the Commissioner
of Scotland Yard!

324
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:56,067
It's quite comfortable,
Sir Arthur...

325
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,567
I see why you guard it.

326
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,108
It's you...! What are you
doing here?

327
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:02,567
I bear you a message
from Her Majesty...

328
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,483
It's... quite delicate...
to say the least.

329
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,650
Get me to the sweets
factory...! And quickly!

330
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:16,567
Damn...! What are those
drugs doing in my product?

331
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,608
And the orders
from the Queen...

332
00:17:18,692 --> 00:17:21,817
how is this all connected to
the dead man at the docks...?

333
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,400
Where's the link?

334
00:17:24,483 --> 00:17:28,817
We're missing something here...
Some vital piece of the puzzle.

335
00:17:30,442 --> 00:17:31,525
Ranmao,

336
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:33,942
Tell me, which do
you think is worse?

337
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:36,900
To be unable to wake
yourself from your dream...

338
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:40,358
Or to be unable to dream
of anything at all?

339
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:43,692
But of course, all things
that seem eternal...

340
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:46,692
whether waking or sleeping
must someday come

341
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,567
to an end.

342
00:17:51,525 --> 00:17:52,692
Shi-dagu

343
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:56,192
Surrender!

344
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:04,733
Halt!

345
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:16,233
You are a reckless man...
Had anybody else been driving

346
00:18:16,317 --> 00:18:18,233
you would have been trampled.

347
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:19,983
I knew full well who
you were and thats...

348
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:22,025
why you were stopped.

349
00:18:26,858 --> 00:18:29,275
What goes on out there,
Sebastian?

350
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,317
I have stopped you,
Lord Phantomhive...

351
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,733
Please step down...

352
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:34,650
You're under arrest in
the name of her Majesty..

353
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:36,442
For violating the
Pharmacy Act.

354
00:18:36,525 --> 00:18:38,025
Allow me, master.

355
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:43,942
So... You would dare detain me?

356
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:46,025
Do you have any idea the
magnitude of the insult

357
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:48,150
you offer the house
of my family?

358
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:52,483
And you, an untitled
police inspector, no less.

359
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:53,858
I'm afraid
that's correct, Ciel...

360
00:18:53,942 --> 00:18:55,983
You're suspected of
collaboration with

361
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:57,817
that drug pusher,
Lau... We know

362
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,650
you've been distributing
a new form of narcotic.

363
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:04,358
With Lau...?
Hah! That's just ridiculous...

364
00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:05,983
I'll admit that I've been
using him as a pawn

365
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:07,317
for some time...

366
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,775
But Randall knew
full well he was

367
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:11,900
running an opium den, and
he's never said a word.

368
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,692
If that's a problem,
then arrest Lau...

369
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:16,608
He knows I would
never protect him.

370
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:18,983
Lau runs his business
at his own risk,

371
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:21,192
and by his own hand.

372
00:19:21,275 --> 00:19:24,233
You own a warehouse, yes?
Located down by the docks?

373
00:19:24,317 --> 00:19:25,567
Yes.

374
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,067
That's where we found it...

375
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,275
A large hidden cache of the
opiate known as Lady Blanc.

376
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:33,900
Far too great an amount
for you to claim

377
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:35,692
recreational use...

378
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:38,650
Some of it already inside
Funtom sweet wrappers.

379
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:40,900
And Lau?

380
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:42,358
He's on the run...

381
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:45,317
The team we sent after him
suffered great casualties...

382
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,525
Practically an
admission of guilt.

383
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:50,692
What would you
have me do my lord?

384
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:55,983
Should I let them take me in
for now...? Or not?

385
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:57,733
Sebastian... My order--

386
00:19:57,817 --> 00:20:00,650
Shut your mouth now...
you brat!

387
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,692
Abberline...
I thought I told you...

388
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:06,400
You were to separate the
boy Earl from his butler.

389
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:07,942
Randall...

390
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:09,775
I wonder that you would
choose to point a gun

391
00:20:09,858 --> 00:20:12,108
at me, knowing what
it means to do so.

392
00:20:12,192 --> 00:20:15,275
Well now, if you'd like to
resist, please be my guest, sir.

393
00:20:15,358 --> 00:20:16,817
but I assure you,
that will be the end

394
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,692
of the Phantomhive
family name...

395
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:21,608
sullied as it is by now,
perhaps that's for the best.

396
00:20:21,692 --> 00:20:23,067
You would dare?!

397
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,275
My orders come directly from
the Queen's representative

398
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,733
and he made Her Majesty's
intent quite clear.

399
00:20:27,817 --> 00:20:29,692
Only the criminal
responsible would've known

400
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:31,150
what the Queen was seeking...

401
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:33,150
The rumor we heard
spoke of a document,

402
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,733
you see, and so we knew.

403
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:39,733
Therefore, please detain Lau...
and his benefactor, Phantomhive.

404
00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:42,483
Oh... And don't worry
about having to conceal

405
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:46,400
what the charge is...
We'll find a suitable pretext.

406
00:20:46,483 --> 00:20:47,650
Right...

407
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:49,525
And what shall I do with
them after the arrest?

408
00:20:51,358 --> 00:20:53,650
Ciel Phantomhive,
you are under arrest...

409
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:56,692
In her Majesty's name...
and I do hereby suspend...

410
00:20:56,775 --> 00:21:00,067
all of your privileges
and authority.

411
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,025
If you defy the law
in this matter...

412
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:05,358
you shall be stripped of
your title for high treason.

413
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:09,233
Furthermore... The man known
to the state as Lau...

414
00:21:09,317 --> 00:21:11,192
Opium smuggler and head
of the English branch

415
00:21:11,275 --> 00:21:12,775
of Kunlun...

416
00:21:12,858 --> 00:21:16,692
shall be summarily executed for
his crimes against the crown.

417
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,400
Lord Phantomhive... will
you confess to knowledge

418
00:21:19,483 --> 00:21:21,317
of Lau's whereabouts
or the whereabouts

419
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,025
of the letter we know
you have concealed?

420
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:29,275
I'm afraid... I can
tell you nothing.

421
00:21:29,358 --> 00:21:32,733
A letter...? That must
be the missing piece.

422
00:21:32,817 --> 00:21:36,608
I should very much like to push
you on that bit of evasion...

423
00:21:36,692 --> 00:21:40,567
Sadly, Her Majesty forbids
torturing a peer of the realm...

424
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:45,233
However there are no such
rules about butlers.

425
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,358
Offer no resistance.

426
00:22:09,442 --> 00:22:12,567
When the time is right,
I'll call for you...

427
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,983
And then we will show them...

428
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:18,400
what becomes of those
who humiliate me...

429
00:22:18,483 --> 00:22:20,608
Do you understand?

430
00:22:22,025 --> 00:22:24,025
Yes, my lord.

431
00:24:10,608 --> 00:24:13,567
If your intent is to torture me,
you'll need better technique

432
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,192
than that.

433
00:24:15,275 --> 00:24:18,275
The only pain I truly feel is
when I instruct my master

434
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:20,775
on the concept of dancing.

435
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:22,900
I'm fairly certain the
prase "two left feet"

436
00:24:22,983 --> 00:24:25,275
was invented precisely for him.

437
00:24:25,358 --> 00:24:28,608
So a beating of two
compared to that...

438
00:24:28,692 --> 00:24:32,108
all I can do is laugh
at your attempts.

439
00:24:32,192 --> 00:24:35,692
Next time on Black Butler,
"His Butler, Escaping."

440
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:38,525
You see, I am simply
one hell of a butler.
