1
00:00:21,608 --> 00:00:24,358
I don't understand why we
can't celebrate...

2
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:26,233
Tomorrow's an important day
for the young master,

3
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,358
after all...

4
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:29,233
It's a special occasion.

5
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:32,400
I wish we could make it
lovely for him, yes I do.

6
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:40,525
I'm heeeeeere!

7
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:42,692
Lady Elizabeth?!

8
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:22,733
Cieeeeelllll!

9
00:02:22,817 --> 00:02:23,817
Lizzie?!

10
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:31,400
Here, this is for you...!
Open it, okay?

11
00:02:31,483 --> 00:02:32,692
I can't wait!

12
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,567
Hold on a moment...!

13
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,567
I thought I broke this ring
a while ago.

14
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,317
Well, fortunately Sebastian
was able to repair it.

15
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
But that's impossible.
It was chipped...!

16
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:48,067
I don't even see
a single crack.

17
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,400
That is true.

18
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:50,817
But if I couldn't do
something so simple then...

19
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,192
...then what kind of butler
would he be, really?

20
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:56,775
You took the words
out of my mouth sir.

21
00:02:56,858 --> 00:03:00,400
Oh, he fixed it...
That's fantastic news.

22
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:01,942
My lady? Are you all right?

23
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:03,608
So, Lady Elizabeth...

24
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:05,442
What do you have
in the box there?

25
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:08,775
Oh, it's nothing.
It's a secret!

26
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:11,358
A secret?

27
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:12,983
But you just told me
to open it, didn't you?

28
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,817
I was teasing you, silly!

29
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,983
Teasing?

30
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:20,317
No proper lady would try
to win a gentleman

31
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,942
with material things...
That would be unseemly...

32
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:26,025
Now, are you ready, Paula?
Ring the bells!

33
00:03:26,108 --> 00:03:29,483
Oh, yes, of course, my lady...
Jingle, jingle, jingle.

34
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:32,025
Well, that's all,
so have a good day!

35
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:39,150
She came here...
to ring some bells for me?

36
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:41,942
Tomorrow is your birthday,
young master...

37
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:44,233
I'm sure that's why she came.

38
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:50,775
So, what do you think...? Shall
we hold a birthday party...?

39
00:03:50,858 --> 00:03:52,775
It seems that
some people would like

40
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,442
to celebrate with you.

41
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:05,233
Tomorrow...
is my birthday.

42
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:17,942
Hey, mister...! Today's my
birthday! Exciting, huh?!

43
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:21,900
Oh, Ciel, please...! I'm sorry
sir, please forgive him.

44
00:04:21,983 --> 00:04:23,025
Not to worry, madam.

45
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:25,192
Your son is a very
charming young man.

46
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:26,775
Mother said that since
it's my birthday

47
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:29,858
I can sleep in the same room
with her and father tonight...

48
00:04:29,942 --> 00:04:33,358
and she's going to read me
as many stories as I want!

49
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:35,817
Then... later that night...

50
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:41,358
Mother, Father,
where are you!? Father--!

51
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:51,317
My mother was going
to read me stories...

52
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,358
My father was going
to give me a present.

53
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:57,358
On this day
you shall be marked...

54
00:04:57,442 --> 00:04:59,858
with the sign
of the noble beast.

55
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,983
I was so excited about it.

56
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,692
Yes...happy birthday to me.

57
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,275
Master?

58
00:05:18,358 --> 00:05:21,233
This is ridiculous.
Bring me my tea.

59
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:22,692
Right away.

60
00:05:35,983 --> 00:05:39,192
Construction on the
Underground, maybe?

61
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:44,108
Oh, I know! Some music could
help us pass the time.

62
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:45,942
Jingle, jingle, jingle!

63
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:46,775
Paula.

64
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:48,525
Jingle, jingle!

65
00:05:48,608 --> 00:05:51,275
You always seem
so happy about everything.

66
00:05:51,358 --> 00:05:53,650
Oh, I'm sorry, my lady!

67
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:55,775
No, I'm not
criticizing you at all...

68
00:05:55,858 --> 00:05:59,525
You just always seem so carefree
and I truly envy that in you.

69
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:00,942
But so do you...

70
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:03,650
Usually you're such
a happy person, my lady...

71
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:05,525
That is--I mean...

72
00:06:05,608 --> 00:06:08,275
Anyway, this traffic is
truly awful, isn't it...?

73
00:06:08,358 --> 00:06:11,233
At this rate, we'll be
stuck here until nightfall.

74
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:33,150
But we can still have fun.
It'll be like a mini vacation!

75
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:38,317
Lady Elizabeth?
Lady Elizabeth!

76
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:21,608
Welcome, little girl.

77
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:27,108
Um...I, uh...

78
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:30,108
I see that you have the ring...

79
00:07:30,192 --> 00:07:32,817
Yes, indeed, you have it.
Unfortunately, however,

80
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,108
it appears that the stone
has not chosen you

81
00:07:35,192 --> 00:07:36,858
to be its new master.

82
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:43,067
But, my... look how
lovely those eyes are.

83
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,900
I'm... sorry...
but I'm betrothed, sir.

84
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:48,650
Ciel is the
only man I care for.

85
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,983
Your eyes are like deep,
green pools...

86
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:53,525
and there's so much
sorrow in them.

87
00:07:55,692 --> 00:08:00,900
You can't hide it from me.
I can tell you're very sad.

88
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:13,317
I understand...
A birthday present, was it?

89
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,025
Yes, for Ciel...
I wanted to make him happy!

90
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:23,108
As you can see, we sell
many things in this shop...

91
00:08:23,192 --> 00:08:25,942
Any one of them would
make a wonderful gift.

92
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:48,483
Lovely, aren't they? You can
have your pick of them...

93
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:50,817
Please choose whichever
one you would like.

94
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,733
Thanks, but...

95
00:08:52,817 --> 00:08:55,442
Yes, I understand.
You're looking them over,

96
00:08:55,525 --> 00:08:58,483
but nothing seems
unique enough for him.

97
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:02,608
So then, my lady,
I think to myself...

98
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:05,858
You must be searching for
a very special present

99
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:08,275
for a very special person.

100
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:11,733
I believe I know
just the thing for him.

101
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:19,400
It's perfect...
We'll give him you.

102
00:09:23,692 --> 00:09:25,525
Elizabeth's disappeared?

103
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:28,608
Yes... Her maid says
she lost track of her

104
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:31,108
when they were stuck
in traffic in Islington.

105
00:09:31,192 --> 00:09:32,900
Then that's where
we are headed...

106
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:34,858
Honestly, what was
she thinking--?

107
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,817
First, you should look at this.

108
00:09:40,608 --> 00:09:43,067
Scotland Yard has been
investigating a series

109
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,525
of kidnappings... The targets
are always young girls...

110
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:48,358
Their bodies have not
turned up yet,

111
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:50,400
but they're most
likely dead.

112
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,692
The kidnapper sends a piece
of the Hope Diamond

113
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:56,442
to each of his victims
before taking them...

114
00:09:56,525 --> 00:09:58,525
The very diamond said
to bring a curse upon

115
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:00,317
whoever owns it.

116
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,025
The gem we were
recently chasing after...

117
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:07,858
Who knew we'd hear
about it again like this?

118
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:09,567
What now, my lord?

119
00:10:10,692 --> 00:10:12,608
We do what the queen
has asked of us...

120
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:15,608
That is always
our first priority.

121
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:18,608
My job... as guardian
of the underworld.

122
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:23,858
Pardon the intrusion.

123
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:33,358
My apologies...

124
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:37,067
I am very sorry for keeping
you waiting, master.

125
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:41,858
The next doll...
she is almost ready... sir.

126
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:47,233
Build it up with wax and stone,
wax and stone wax and stone.

127
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:52,358
Build it up with wax
and stone, my fair lady.

128
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:56,483
As you wish master.
I shall see to it.

129
00:11:03,025 --> 00:11:04,275
What is it?

130
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:07,442
Are you prepared...?
I have an order to give you.

131
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:08,733
Yes?

132
00:11:08,817 --> 00:11:11,233
Question everyone
who knew the victims...

133
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:15,233
friends, family...
and make up a suspect list.

134
00:11:15,317 --> 00:11:19,150
Get names and addresses...
then search the crime scenes...

135
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:23,275
It shouldn't take long...
three hours should be enough.

136
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:27,108
While you're seeing to that,
I have some other business

137
00:11:27,192 --> 00:11:31,192
to take care of...
Am I understood?

138
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:32,817
Perfectly, sir.

139
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,650
Then hurry and get on with it.

140
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:37,192
Of course...
As you wish, my lord.

141
00:11:49,192 --> 00:11:52,525
Oh, I'm getting close!
Yes, I'm almost there!

142
00:11:57,608 --> 00:12:00,942
I can feel it... a gorgeous
gentleman is nearby!

143
00:12:10,192 --> 00:12:12,983
Paula said she lost Lizzie
somewhere around here.

144
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,358
Why did I have to
bring him with me?

145
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:21,025
Take this with you,
young master...

146
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,192
I think you might
find it useful.

147
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:25,983
Useful? How so?

148
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:27,525
Well sir, if necessary...

149
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:30,108
You can throw it
at an attacker and run.

150
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,442
Well, anyway...
You're a dog...

151
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:38,400
which means you can
track scents, can't you?

152
00:12:41,442 --> 00:12:43,358
Here's the ribbon
from Lizzie's gift.

153
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:48,983
You stupid
little mongrel.

154
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:51,358
Is Sebastian
the only one you'll listen to?

155
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,317
Why do you have to start
looking for a mate now?!

156
00:13:01,942 --> 00:13:05,983
A man looking for a mate...?
Perhaps I can help!

157
00:13:10,358 --> 00:13:15,233
I am a hunter of love, and at
last... my prey is before me...

158
00:13:15,317 --> 00:13:19,900
Red is the color of fiery
passion... and I am flaming!

159
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,942
Red...

160
00:13:26,317 --> 00:13:30,108
A gorgeous man...
right theeerrree!

161
00:13:40,858 --> 00:13:41,983
You again?!

162
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:44,900
A deadly efficient butler,
that's me!

163
00:13:48,483 --> 00:13:52,692
Though... I do find myself
master-less at the moment.

164
00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:59,275
After the Madam Red incident,
I was temporarily demoted...

165
00:13:59,358 --> 00:14:02,567
and now I only get
the lowliest of jobs.

166
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,692
That brute Will told me I
wouldn't get my old post back

167
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:08,483
until I collected some
truly troublesome souls...

168
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:11,025
Rotten sadist!

169
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:13,650
Although I must confess,
I like rotten fruit

170
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:16,733
every now and then... And
those cold, brooding eyes of his

171
00:14:16,817 --> 00:14:19,983
could sure keep me warm
enough on a freezing night.

172
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,608
And who is this wild
one...? He's a cutie!

173
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:26,858
Oh, dear...

174
00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:29,733
You aren't considering avenging
your beloved Aunt Red, are you?

175
00:14:29,817 --> 00:14:31,692
I mean that
would just be silly!

176
00:14:31,775 --> 00:14:32,983
You shut up!

177
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:35,733
Now, now, be nice. I don't
see Bassy anywhere.

178
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:37,483
What could a brat like
you do without him?

179
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,733
Be quiet!

180
00:14:41,775 --> 00:14:44,275
Oh, is he your protector
for the evening...?

181
00:14:44,358 --> 00:14:47,400
Why does this little kid get
all the good looking men?

182
00:14:48,317 --> 00:14:50,900
Ooh! He's going
to attack me.

183
00:14:50,983 --> 00:14:53,942
How exciting! I'm all yours,
but please be gentle!

184
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:58,150
Hey, what am I?
Chopped liver?

185
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:12,483
Lizzie!

186
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:15,025
Look what we have here, number
four-hundred-and-ninety-three

187
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:16,567
on the To-Die list.

188
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,442
Butler and puppeteer
to the house of Mandalay.

189
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:21,775
A Mister... Drossel Keinz

190
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,150
Boy?

191
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:43,108
Lizzie!

192
00:16:08,108 --> 00:16:11,775
Lizzie's somewhere in that
mansion... I know it!

193
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:13,275
Goodness...

194
00:16:13,358 --> 00:16:16,608
Not exactly the most
welcoming of places, is it?

195
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,317
This is the man
who killed Madam Red.

196
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
But... I need him.

197
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:32,233
Fine, Grell... Come in with me.

198
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:35,733
Protect me
and I'll grant a request.

199
00:16:35,817 --> 00:16:38,608
How insulting! Earl or not, you
think I'm the type of woman

200
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:40,108
you can just buy
with money?!

201
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:42,067
I'll give you
Sebastian for a day.

202
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,983
You can do whatever
you want with him.

203
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:49,525
Sebastian and whatever I want
to do...? Even kissing?!

204
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:50,650
If that's what you want.

205
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:53,275
Does that mean
I can use tongue?!

206
00:16:53,358 --> 00:16:55,733
Do anything
you please with him.

207
00:16:57,317 --> 00:17:01,567
Oh, my, yes! That's an offer
I couldn't possibly refuse.

208
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,358
I'm deadly serious!

209
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:10,942
Build it up with wax and stone,
wax and stone, wax and stone.

210
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:17,025
Build it up with wax
and stone, my fair lady.

211
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:32,650
All right, here we go!

212
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:42,317
Hey, look.

213
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,942
That ring's a lot
like yours, isn't it?

214
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:46,400
The Hope Diamond?!

215
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:50,983
This doll looks like...

216
00:17:53,775 --> 00:17:55,275
Impossible!

217
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:04,900
Help, Pluto!

218
00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:09,858
You stupid, useless mongrel!

219
00:18:14,775 --> 00:18:17,858
Now, why would you call the
puppy when you should be

220
00:18:17,942 --> 00:18:19,525
calling on me?

221
00:18:21,483 --> 00:18:22,692
Grell!

222
00:18:22,775 --> 00:18:25,192
As a reaper, I have
all the tools needed

223
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:29,483
for harvesting a soul...
See...! My death scythe!

224
00:18:32,483 --> 00:18:34,650
But aren't those
just... scissors?

225
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:36,108
What do you
want me to do?!

226
00:18:36,192 --> 00:18:39,108
Will took away my personally
modified death scythe...!

227
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:41,108
I miss it so much!

228
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:45,442
I'll show you!
I'll snip her into bits!

229
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:49,067
Hold on...! Don't hurt her!
She isn't actually a doll!

230
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,817
Die...! Welcome
to the afterlife!

231
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:04,900
Maybe she was a doll after all.

232
00:19:06,317 --> 00:19:12,775
Wood and clay will wash away,
wash away, wash away...

233
00:19:16,108 --> 00:19:19,567
What a useless doll...
She was an utter failure.

234
00:19:21,483 --> 00:19:23,608
So then, I thought to myself...

235
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:24,983
"In order to succeed,

236
00:19:25,067 --> 00:19:27,858
I must make them considerably
stronger than this."

237
00:19:30,983 --> 00:19:35,108
Build it up with iron and
steel, iron and steel,

238
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:41,900
iron and steel, Build it up with
iron and steel, my fair lady.

239
00:19:44,275 --> 00:19:45,942
I've seen them before...

240
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:48,733
I'm not going to let anyone
take away my day with dear,

241
00:19:48,817 --> 00:19:50,108
sweet Bassy!

242
00:19:50,192 --> 00:19:51,608
Hold on, Grell! Wait!

243
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:54,025
Take this, dolls!

244
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,733
I-I couldn't cut them!

245
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,025
Grell, this is an order!

246
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:06,858
You and Pluto stay here
and keep the dolls occupied.

247
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:09,275
Play with them.
For as long as it takes.

248
00:20:09,358 --> 00:20:10,692
Huh?

249
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:17,775
You're going to leave me
here? Not very human of you!!

250
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:19,858
I'm the inhuman one?

251
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:25,233
The dolls look just like the
pictures of the kidnapped

252
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:32,650
girls... No... the dolls are the
girls. That means... Lizzie...!

253
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:39,775
Ciel Phantomhive.

254
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:47,108
You are indeed a beautiful
specimen. I'll have to make you

255
00:20:47,192 --> 00:20:50,567
into a doll worthy
of such exquisite beauty.

256
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,817
What've you done
with Elizabeth?!

257
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,192
Now, what material
should I use for you?

258
00:20:56,275 --> 00:20:59,233
Clay will wash away
too easily, but iron is

259
00:20:59,317 --> 00:21:04,025
far too crude for you. So
then. I thought to myself...

260
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:08,567
Build it up with silver
and gold, silver and gold,

261
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:13,025
silver and gold. Build
it up with silver and gold,

262
00:21:13,108 --> 00:21:15,608
my fair lady.

263
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:20,900
Build it up with silver and
gold, silver and gold,

264
00:21:20,983 --> 00:21:24,650
silver and gold. Build
it up with silver and gold,

265
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:27,150
my fair lady.

266
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:30,983
Build it up with silver
and gold, silver and gold,

267
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:34,525
silver and gold. Build
it up with silver and gold,

268
00:21:34,608 --> 00:21:36,942
my fair lady.

269
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:40,858
Build it up with silver and
gold, silver and gold,

270
00:21:40,942 --> 00:21:43,608
silver and gold--

271
00:21:53,983 --> 00:21:57,608
That day... My birthday

272
00:21:57,692 --> 00:22:00,150
My life changed forever.

273
00:22:04,108 --> 00:22:07,275
As long as I live...
I will never know

274
00:22:07,358 --> 00:22:09,317
a happy birthday again.

275
00:22:13,483 --> 00:22:15,483
Never!

276
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,858
Truly, master...

277
00:22:17,942 --> 00:22:20,983
Nothing good ever happens
on your birthday, does it?

278
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,858
You lost your parents...
Your home... And this time...

279
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:30,067
you stand to lose
Lady Elizabeth?

280
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,317
Sebastian!

281
00:24:11,067 --> 00:24:12,608
Like a helpless puppet,

282
00:24:12,692 --> 00:24:15,900
he's manipulated by the horrible
memories he cannot let go.

283
00:24:17,108 --> 00:24:21,650
Young master, I didn't bargain
for such a feeble soul.

284
00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:26,900
Stand tall... look to the
sky... and join me.

285
00:24:26,983 --> 00:24:31,775
London Bridge is falling down!

286
00:24:31,858 --> 00:24:35,567
Next time, on Black Butler:
"His Butler, Forlorn."

287
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,108
You see, I am simply
one hell of a butler.
