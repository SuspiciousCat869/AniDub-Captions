00:08:39,442 --> 00:08:40,192
[GRELL] My...
...my Bassy...!

164
00:08:40,275 --> 00:08:41,942
You're terrifying!

165
00:08:43,358 --> 00:08:44,608
[dog makes a questioning sound]

166
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:20,525
[WOMAN] Oh...!
It's the viscount!

167
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:29,317
[FINNIAN] Look at that...!
There's so many people!

168
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:32,525
I'm so ready!

169
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:41,192
Finally, I can show off
my prowess as an actress!

170
00:09:41,275 --> 00:09:42,108
[ELIZABETH] Oh, my...!

171
00:09:42,192 --> 00:09:45,108
This costume isn't cute at all!

172
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,858
[SEBASTIAN] Where is he?

173
00:09:49,942 --> 00:09:50,858
[MEY LIN] Oh, I...

174
00:09:50,942 --> 00:09:52,650
I think he went
to the restroom...

175
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,692
[SEBASTIAN] So this
is where you've been...

176
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:01,233
Master.

177
00:10:02,358 --> 00:10:04,608
[SEBASTIAN] A bit too
late to decline the part...

178
00:10:04,692 --> 00:10:06,483
Terribly sorry.

179
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:08,983
[CIEL] I am a young prince...

180
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:12,025
I lost my father
and burn for revenge.

181
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:13,358
I know you...

182
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:16,400
You didn't give me this
part on accident, did you?

183
00:10:17,192 --> 00:10:19,775
You lack acting
experience, sir...

184
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:22,608
And I'm afraid you scarcely
possess the dexterity required

185
00:10:22,692 --> 00:10:24,525
to button your own shirts.

186
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:26,192
[SEBASTIAN] I didn't
want to cast you in a part

187
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:28,067
too different from
who you are...

188
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,400
I thought it might be
too difficult for you.

189
00:10:30,483 --> 00:10:31,525
Really?!

190
00:10:31,608 --> 00:10:34,692
Why shouldn't we
proceed this way, master?

191
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:36,442
There is bloody revenge coming.

192
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:39,317
Should this not then
be its prelude?

193
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,108
[SEBASTIAN] Master...
are you ready?

194
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:49,400
The curtain is rising
on this tale at last.

195
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:11,233
[PLUTO] So, they're on holiday.

196
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,942
[PLUTO] Which also means...
I get a holiday as well.

197
00:11:19,275 --> 00:11:21,275
[PLUTO] Crunchy and delicious!

198
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:23,858
[PLUTO] And here I go!

199
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:25,608
[Pluto howls]

200
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:27,817
[PLUTO] Inukko: puppies love it!

201
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,442
[FINNIAN] The King
of Denmark has met

202
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:37,400
with an
untimely death...

203
00:11:37,483 --> 00:11:40,108
He is succeeded
by his young brother...

204
00:11:40,192 --> 00:11:42,692
Claudius has been crowned king.

205
00:11:42,775 --> 00:11:45,025
And the late king's
wife who, until now,

206
00:11:45,108 --> 00:11:47,608
had seemed to love
him unconditionally...

207
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:52,275
...has scandalously become the
bride of Denmark's newest ruler.

208
00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:54,567
[LAU] Oh...!

209
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,358
What happened to my brother
is such a terrible tragedy...!

210
00:11:57,442 --> 00:11:58,567
But we're both still alive,

211
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,275
so shouldn't we enjoy
ourselves, huh?

212
00:12:01,983 --> 00:12:04,150
[UNDERTAKER]
Absolutely, my dear!

213
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:06,025
[LAU] Pardon my reach...

214
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:09,525
Ah...
how lovely you are...!

215
00:12:09,608 --> 00:12:12,525
Your bosom... like a
pair of new, ripe apples...

216
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:15,983
Simply heavenly... heavenly,
heavenly, my darling--

217
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,358
[Undertaker laughs]

218
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:18,650
[LAU] Tickle tickle...!

219
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:20,608
You know you like it,
don't you, darling?!

220
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:22,108
Your Majesty, you're
getting a bit handsy for me...!

221
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:24,650
I am a lady, after all!

222
00:12:30,775 --> 00:12:33,025
[FINNIAN] And then, in
a startling development,

223
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:37,358
the late king's son, Hamlet,
encounters him as a ghost.

224
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,317
Oh, no...!

225
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,358
My father...!
What can this mean that

226
00:12:43,442 --> 00:12:45,442
thou appearest so before me?

227
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:47,567
[grunts three times]

228
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,983
Is that so...?

229
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:50,733
It was my vile uncle...?

230
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:54,442
That man... the devil,
Claudius, did this to you...!

231
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:57,233
He poured poison
in your ear, Father?!

232
00:12:57,317 --> 00:12:59,233
[grunts three times]

233
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:01,150
I understand what you ask...

234
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:04,733
Yes, you bid me to
take revenge in thy place.

235
00:13:07,108 --> 00:13:09,983
I will do
as you ask, Father.

236
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:11,775
[BARDROY] That's funny,
I didn't hear him say that.

237
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:15,150
[MEY LIN] Tanaka can convey
all of that just by being there.

238
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:16,775
[SOMA] What I'd
like to know is why

239
00:13:16,858 --> 00:13:19,692
I'm sitting here playing
a stagehand, huh?!

240
00:13:19,775 --> 00:13:22,150
It might help if you
weren't eating curry.

241
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:23,733
I promise you...

242
00:13:23,817 --> 00:13:26,567
...that my hatred shall
live along with yours...

243
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,400
I will avenge you, though it
may mean the fires of Hell.

244
00:13:30,483 --> 00:13:32,608
I swear it
here and now...

245
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:36,150
...in your name,
vengeance shall be mine!

246
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,942
An enthusiastic performance,
don't you think?!

247
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:41,192
[BARDROY] Come on now,

248
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:42,608
can't you do better with
that light than that?!

249
00:13:42,692 --> 00:13:45,650
[SOMA] It isn't like I
volunteered to be a stagehand!

250
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:48,067
[SEBASTIAN] Then maybe
you should stop eating...

251
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,983
Now then...

252
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:50,567
How is the audience?

253
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,817
[SEBASTIAN]
I don't know that children

254
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,525
can quite understand Hamlet.

255
00:14:00,608 --> 00:14:03,525
Hamlet must somehow
deceive his uncle...

256
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:05,317
Thus, he makes a plan...

257
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,733
He will seem to
be hurt by Ophelia,

258
00:14:07,817 --> 00:14:10,358
and he will appear to go mad.

259
00:14:13,025 --> 00:14:15,192
Oh, I'm simply terrible...!

260
00:14:15,275 --> 00:14:17,317
Terrible!

261
00:14:20,108 --> 00:14:22,400
[AGNI] Ophelia...
there you are!

262
00:14:22,483 --> 00:14:24,442
[GRELL] Hello, Father!

263
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:25,817
Oh, goodness...!

264
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,525
Now I've gotten a better
look at thee, yes I have...!

265
00:14:28,983 --> 00:14:33,442
And how handsome
you are, my darling father!

266
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:35,942
[GRELL]
I know it's forbidden,

267
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:38,983
but what a beautiful
love we could have!

268
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:45,733
I cannot even begin
to fathom such depravity...!

269
00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:46,900
Who could forgive such heinous

270
00:14:46,983 --> 00:14:49,400
acts between father
and daughter?!

271
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:52,525
[GRELL] But...
please...

272
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:54,108
[FINNIAN] And one
thing led to another.

273
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:56,400
Ophelia as well met
an untimely end.

274
00:14:56,483 --> 00:14:57,150
No...!

275
00:14:57,233 --> 00:14:58,317
It's not time...

276
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,858
Ophelia isn't supposed
to die this early!

277
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:05,067
And she did not
receive a proper burial!

278
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,067
[ELIZABETH] This'll be easy!
Let's toss her in the river.

279
00:15:11,983 --> 00:15:14,567
[GRELL] Oh, my dear father...

280
00:15:14,942 --> 00:15:18,358
Seaweed, seaweed...

281
00:15:18,442 --> 00:15:21,733
...oh, how lovely it is...

282
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:25,275
Seaweed, seaweed,
oh how lovely it is!

283
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,358
Oh my...

284
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:28,442
I dare say she seems
to be quite a hit.

285
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:29,317
[KID 1] Seaweed!

286
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,233
[KID 2] Heck, yeah!

287
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:34,942
[MEY LIN] Sounds like
she's popular with the kids!

288
00:15:35,983 --> 00:15:37,108
One more reason I ain't

289
00:15:37,192 --> 00:15:38,733
never gonna understand kids.

290
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:39,858
Finally,

291
00:15:39,942 --> 00:15:41,692
we've broken through
to our audience...

292
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,317
The master's scene
is here at last.

293
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,317
To be or not to be...
that is the question...

294
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:55,942
Whether tis
nobler to suffer...

295
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:59,233
...the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune...

296
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:02,400
...or take arms againt
of a seas of troubles

297
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:04,858
and by opposing end them...

298
00:16:05,317 --> 00:16:09,733
...to die to slumber and
by slumber to end.

299
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:15,233
I don't want to die!

300
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:21,983
Hamlet, must you be
such a pathetic coward...?!

301
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:24,817
You are a most
unworthy hero...!

302
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,567
Your soul is far too weak!

303
00:16:28,442 --> 00:16:32,608
This is my sworn vow...
There's no taking it back.

304
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:37,942
No matter what,
I can never turn away!

305
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,067
[CIEL] But...
I must be off now...

306
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,442
...before my blood begins
to rises any further.

307
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,817
[BARDROY] Bloody hell.

308
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,942
Amazing...!
He's just amazing!

309
00:16:58,608 --> 00:17:00,025
Indeed, he is...

310
00:17:00,108 --> 00:17:02,692
Very true to life,
don't you think?

311
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:10,233
Oh, how he trembles
with such honest fury...!

312
00:17:10,317 --> 00:17:13,900
His slender limbs... are
like such fragile branches--!

313
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,317
[KID]
Shhh...

314
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,150
[DRUITT] Oh, sorry...
Pardon me...

315
00:17:18,983 --> 00:17:20,025
Look at that...

316
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:21,650
Even the children
were able to feel the

317
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:23,650
anguish in his performance...

318
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,108
And now...

319
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:29,067
Looks like it's
time for my turn...

Now, following this
unfortunate turn of events,

321
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:36,650
Hamlet and Ophelia's brother,
Laertes must meet blade to

322
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:40,275
blade in a fencing match
arranged by the king.

323
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,067
[FINNIAN] However...

324
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,025
...the tip of Laertes' sword
has been coated with poison...

325
00:17:52,108 --> 00:17:55,483
...one that will kill a
man with a single drop.

326
00:17:58,025 --> 00:18:00,192
[KID 1] Okay,
I'm getting scared now!

327
00:18:00,275 --> 00:18:03,317
Thou art Ophelia's
esteemed brother...

328
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,983
I've heard much of
your skill with a sword.

329
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:08,150
I've heard the same of thee...

330

Perhaps you will see
fit to take pity on me.

Yes, yes...

332
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,942
...that's about enough
chat for now, I think.

333

We'll have a ten-point match...

334

"Old guy?"

It's the king...!

He lied about the
match being fair!

Don't you see, Hamlet?

What's my line...?

What do we do?!
