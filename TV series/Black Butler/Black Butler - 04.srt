1
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:38,400
I hate this...
There are too many people

2
00:00:38,483 --> 00:00:39,442
in London.

3
00:00:39,525 --> 00:00:42,025
There is no helping it,
my lord...

4
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:44,442
It's tradition for the
nobility to migrate en masse

5
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:46,692
to town from the
country every Season.

6
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:50,150
The Season, eh...? A waste
of time, if you ask me.

7
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,067
Getting away from the
manor could prove a nice

8
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,650
change of pace.

9
00:00:55,483 --> 00:00:58,192
It's a break from
those four, at least.

10
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:01,192
We can enjoy a little peace
and quiet for a time.

11
00:01:01,275 --> 00:01:03,692
Some peace and quiet
does sound nice.

12
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,150
Goodness sake...!
Where do they keep the tea

13
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:10,025
in this house?

14
00:01:10,108 --> 00:01:11,942
I can't find it either!

15
00:01:12,025 --> 00:01:14,733
Don't be silly! Of course
it's not in there.

16
00:01:15,983 --> 00:01:18,900
Madam Red?! Lau...?!
Why are you here?

17
00:01:18,983 --> 00:01:21,608
Ciel...! You're early, dear.

18
00:01:21,692 --> 00:01:24,775
Your sudden appearance here
in town... must means one thing.

19
00:01:24,858 --> 00:01:28,025
The Queen's Guard Dog
has a new scent to follow.

20
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:09,817
He struck again...
Another prostitute was found

21
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,108
gruesomely murdered
in Whitechapel...

22
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,317
These killings
are far from normal...

23
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,275
The level of violence
we're seeing is unprecedented.

24
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,900
The most recent victim
was a woman named

25
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:21,358
Mary Ann Nichols...

26
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:22,650
It appears
a special type of blade

27
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:23,983
was used on her.

28
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:26,900
She was torn up
beyond recognition.

29
00:03:26,983 --> 00:03:29,025
The murderer's distinctive
style of killing

30
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:32,400
has earned him a unique
nickname from the press.

31
00:03:32,483 --> 00:03:34,108
"Jack the Ripper."

32
00:03:35,942 --> 00:03:38,233
A frightening name... eh?

33
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:40,317
That's why I'm here
earlier than expected.

34
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,733
I hurried into town
to look into the situation

35
00:03:42,817 --> 00:03:44,108
for myself.

36
00:03:45,317 --> 00:03:46,942
But are you sure
you're brave enough

37
00:03:47,025 --> 00:03:49,025
to stomach
the crime scene?

38
00:03:49,108 --> 00:03:50,858
What do you mean by that?

39
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:52,733
The sight of the
dismembered body will certainly

40
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:53,983
be horrific...

41
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,525
And one can only
imagine the stench...

42
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:58,567
Blood and gore everywhere...

43
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,233
Surely it would be
more than enough to

44
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:01,858
drive some men mad...

45
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,275
Are you prepared
to see such a thing?

46
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:07,150
You're just a young boy,
after all.

47
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:08,650
I am the head of the
Phantomhive family

48
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:13,442
in service to my queen.
Don't ask foolish questions.

49
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:16,567
You're right. So sorry.

50
00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:30,483
Sorry, my boy... I'm afraid
a crime scene like this

51
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:31,983
is no place for a child...

52
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,817
Now why don't you just
run along home?

53
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,775
I'm here to see
the victim's body.

54
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,108
The body...?!
Surely you're kidding me!

55
00:04:38,192 --> 00:04:42,067
Abberline! Well,
if it isn't Lord Phantomhive.

56
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,692
What are you doing here?

57
00:04:43,775 --> 00:04:45,275
You know this kid, sir?

58
00:04:45,358 --> 00:04:47,817
I'm here to help, Sir Arthur.
It seems your investigation

59
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,192
is dragging a bit...

60
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:51,233
You know who sent me,
of course.

61
00:04:54,358 --> 00:04:56,942
It seems you haven't found
any major clues yet.

62
00:04:57,025 --> 00:04:58,817
We at Scotland Yard
are more than capable

63
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,025
of handling this case,
I assure you...

64
00:05:01,108 --> 00:05:02,692
There's no need
for you to interfere.

65
00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:05,567
Splendid...
Shall we go, Sebastian?

66
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,025
Yes, sir.

67
00:05:11,775 --> 00:05:13,400
Now what, dear?

68
00:05:13,483 --> 00:05:16,567
Now we go see someone
who may be of useful.

69
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,400
My lord...! You mean--?

70
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:21,192
Yes, indeed.

71
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,817
So... where are we?

72
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,483
You don't know?
Then what was all that about?!

73
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:31,400
It's a funeral parlor run
by an acquaintance of my lord's.

74
00:05:31,483 --> 00:05:33,317
"The Undertaker?"

75
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:37,650
If we're looking for answers,
this is the place.

76
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:45,067
Welcome...I thought I'd
be seeing you before long.

77
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:50,942
My lord....It's so lovely
to see you.

78
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:53,442
Do I finally have the
pleasure of fitting you

79
00:05:53,525 --> 00:05:55,650
for one of
me coffins today?

80
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:58,567
No, that isn't why
I'm here... I wanted t--

81
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:03,817
No need to say- I'm already
aware... very well aware.

82
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,525
One of my recent customers
was a bit--unusual--

83
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:07,983
shall we say...?

84
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,900
I helped, though...I made
her look beautiful again.

85
00:06:11,983 --> 00:06:14,150
I would like
the details, please.

86
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:16,567
Oh, I see now. So the
funeral parlor is only

87
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,150
your cover business.

88
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:21,150
How much is it...
for information?

89
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,483
I have no need
for the queen's coins.

90
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:25,733
There's only one thing
that I want from you...

91
00:06:27,983 --> 00:06:30,358
Please... my lord...
Give it to me and I'll

92
00:06:30,442 --> 00:06:32,275
tell you anything.

93
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:38,317
Give me the extraordinary
gift of true laughter...!

94
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Just one joke and all me
information is yours.

95
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:44,900
Lunatic.

96
00:06:44,983 --> 00:06:48,025
Leave it to me, my lord.
Here is my joke...

97
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,317
It's a classic,
on which side does a tiger

98
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,733
have the most stripes...?

99
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:53,483
On the outside!

100
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:57,150
Get it? Ha ha..?

101
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:00,942
Ha ha?

102
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:05,233
My turn. I live for gossip!
So this story will make you

103
00:07:05,317 --> 00:07:08,775
laugh so hard, you'll
simply curl up and die!

104
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:11,150
So, Alice's beau gave her
the most extraordinary...

105
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:14,317
for her birthday. It
was... and white and so...

106
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,692
with thick veins
running down the...

107
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:17,567
But you see, before
she could use it-

108
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:21,525
Now, my lord, it looks like
you're the only one left.

109
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,858
I gave you a special
discount last time,

110
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:25,858
but I'm not going to
do it again!

111
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,400
It can't be helped...

112
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,192
Sebastian?

113
00:07:32,775 --> 00:07:35,900
Everyone...
please wait outside.

114
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:39,817
No matter what happens, do not
attempt to listen to this.

115
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:53,650
Please, do come back
in now...

116
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:56,025
I believe he'll tell us
everything we want to know.

117
00:07:56,108 --> 00:08:00,525
Oh, my... I've now seen a
face of the ultimate bliss.

118
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:05,233
An interesting pattern
I'm seeing these days...

119
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:08,275
I often get customers
who are incomplete.

120
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,192
Incomplete?

121
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:15,817
Yes...the uterus is
missing... which is quite...odd.

122
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,442
The killer makes
a big mess of the body,

123
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:22,692
but that particular part is
always precisely excised.

124
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:24,608
He did it on a road
that was public,

125
00:08:24,692 --> 00:08:26,275
though not high-traffic...

126
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:28,775
Wouldn't an amateur have
a difficult time carrying out

127
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:31,983
such a complicated
procedure quickly enough?

128
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:34,608
You're a clever one, butler...

129
00:08:34,692 --> 00:08:36,942
That is exactly what
I was thinking.

130
00:08:39,608 --> 00:08:43,025
You see... first he slits their
throat with a sharp weapon...

131
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:46,067
then he rips into
them right here...

132
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,775
And takes that
precious womanly part.

133
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:52,608
There will be more
slain, I'm certain.

134
00:08:52,692 --> 00:08:54,733
Sadistic killers like
this one don't stop

135
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:56,900
until someone makes them.

136
00:08:59,483 --> 00:09:02,942
Will you stop him?
Can you sniff him out...?

137
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:05,067
Like a good little guard dog?

138
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,567
I'm bound by
the honor of my family...

139
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,692
I eliminate any threat
the queen asks me to...

140
00:09:10,775 --> 00:09:13,233
by any means necessary.

141
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:18,567
His information narrows down
our suspects.

142
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,900
First of all, we look at those
with the necessary skill set...

143
00:09:21,983 --> 00:09:24,108
crossing out anyone with an
alibi for the nights on which

144
00:09:24,192 --> 00:09:25,400
the murders occurred...

145
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:27,358
Removal of the organs
would suggest some kind

146
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:28,900
of gruesome ritual...

147
00:09:28,983 --> 00:09:31,233
We should concentrate our
investigation on people

148
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:32,692
involved with
secret societies.

149
00:09:32,775 --> 00:09:34,275
As if that narrows the field?

150
00:09:34,358 --> 00:09:36,817
Why even I would have the
medical skills necessary

151
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,025
for this.

152
00:09:38,108 --> 00:09:40,608
Besides which,
the Season is ending soon...

153
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:43,192
Any doctors who followed
the nobles to the city

154
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:45,025
will be returning to the
country, and then wha--

155
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:47,817
Then we'll have to conclude
the investigation quickly.

156
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,150
Impossible.

157
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:51,275
I should be able to do
this much, at least...

158
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,858
otherwise, what kind
of butler would I be?

159
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:57,067
I'll make up a list of
viable suspects and begin

160
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,567
questioning them for you
immediately, my lord.

161
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:04,858
Now, if you'll excuse me...

162
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:08,733
He knows that
we're moving, right?

163
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:13,150
Sebastian will take care
of it for now...

164
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:16,358
We can head home and have
a cup of tea while we wait.

165
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:26,983
Welcome back, everyone...
I have awaited your return.

166
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:29,942
The afternoon tea is ready
for you in the drawing room.

167
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:33,067
Hold on...!
How are you here?

168
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,817
I finished up that little
errand, so I made my way home

169
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,858
to edify you.

170
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:39,067
You made
the suspect list already.

171
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,275
Well...

172
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:42,275
Yes, I made a list of
names based on what

173
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:44,400
we had discussed...
and then I contacted them all,

174
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:47,067
and I asked them the
relevant questions.

175
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,400
Come now, Sebastian... that's
impossible, even for you.

176
00:10:52,192 --> 00:10:53,942
Richard Oswald, doctor
to the Duke of Bailey,

177
00:10:54,025 --> 00:10:55,567
was at the White Horse
pub with friends.

178
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,150
He has no connection
to secret societies.

179
00:10:57,233 --> 00:10:59,108
Madam Heavitt, surgeon at the
Royal London Central Hospital

180
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,483
was with a man at
the Stipple inn.

181
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:02,192
She has no connection
to secret societies.

182
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:03,817
William Somerset, doctor
to the Earl Chambers

183
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,317
was at a party hosted
by Vie count Harwood.

184
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:12,233
From this information... I
have narrowed down our list...

185
00:11:12,317 --> 00:11:14,233
to one possible suspect.

186
00:11:14,317 --> 00:11:16,400
Are you certain you're
just a butler-

187
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:19,275
not a secret military
intelligence officer?

188
00:11:19,358 --> 00:11:24,567
See... my lady... I'm simply
one hell of a butler.

189
00:11:29,817 --> 00:11:33,358
The Viscount Druit... also
known as Aleister Chambers.

190
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:36,483
He graduated from medical
school but has never

191
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:37,817
gone into practice...

192
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,275
Lately, he's thrown several
parties at his home.

193
00:11:41,358 --> 00:11:43,692
But behind the scenes
at these same soirees

194
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:47,483
are secret gatherings only
his intimates may attend.

195
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:49,567
I've heard that he's into
black magic and those

196
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,192
occult sorts of things.

197
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:54,817
So your suspicion is that
he's holding these parties

198
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,067
to perform
ritualistic sacrifices

199
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,525
of local prostitutes?

200
00:11:59,608 --> 00:12:02,192
Tonight is the last party
of the Season.

201
00:12:08,817 --> 00:12:11,400
Which means this...
is our last chance.

202
00:12:24,525 --> 00:12:27,942
Ciel will be my niece
visiting from the country...

203
00:12:28,025 --> 00:12:31,317
and Sebastian will
be Ciel's tutor.

204
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,150
Why do I have to act
like your niece?!

205
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:35,817
Because, dear, I've
always wanted a girl!

206
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,192
You're kidding me!

207
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:39,317
You don't want them knowing
you're a Phantomhive,

208
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,650
now do you...?

209
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:42,817
Besides, I've heard that
Lord Druit has an eye for

210
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,858
any pretty little thing
in a skirt,

211
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:46,942
and we do want to catch
his eye, right?

212
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:48,817
"By any means necessary"...

213
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,317
You do remember saying
that, do you not, sir?

214
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:54,942
First things first.
We need to locate

215
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,650
this murderous viscount.

216
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:58,150
At least Elizabeth isn't here.

217
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:00,400
I would never want her
seeing me like this.

218
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:02,775
Oh, that dress
is so adorable!

219
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:08,275
I adore all the dresses
here...! They're... lovely!

220
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:10,608
S-S-Se-e-e-e

221
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:13,608
Sir... I mean, mistress,
please calm down.

222
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:14,692
Let's move quickly.

223
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:15,983
Ooooh!

224
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:18,733
You in the pink! Your
dress is just beautiful!

225
00:13:19,692 --> 00:13:21,525
Moving this way now.

226
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,317
Where is she?

227
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:31,525
This isn't good... I
didn't expect her here.

228
00:13:31,608 --> 00:13:33,483
If someone was to see
the head of my family

229
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,900
dressed this way...

230
00:13:34,983 --> 00:13:38,483
The Phantomhive name would
be ruined for generations.

231
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,567
Let's go join Madam Red.

232
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:44,775
You are such a dear!

233
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:47,567
Looks like she's
having a grand old time.

234
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:50,025
There!

235
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,442
Come this way,
my young mistress.

236
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,858
You, man. That young lady
over there requires lemonade.

237
00:13:58,942 --> 00:14:02,400
Yes, certainly sir.
Lemonade, my lady?

238
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,692
Why do these things
always happen to me?

239
00:14:08,775 --> 00:14:11,817
Lord Druit looks as gorgeous
as ever tonight...!

240
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,067
His hair shines
like the sun!

241
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:20,525
That's the Viscount Druit.
Let's go.

242
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:21,650
Yes.

243
00:14:27,942 --> 00:14:30,983
Damn... I'll never get
close to him.

244
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:32,483
We have no choice.

245
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:34,858
We will have to dance our
way over to the viscount.

246
00:14:36,983 --> 00:14:39,442
You really expect me
to dace in public?

247
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:40,567
And with you?!

248
00:14:42,192 --> 00:14:44,733
You already know, young master,
that I am one hell of a dancer.

249
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,192
Besides, as your tutor,
propriety allows me

250
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:49,942
to dance with you at a public
function such as this one.

251
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:52,608
Do... do I have to?

252
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,067
Shall we dance now...
young mistress?

253
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:05,483
We cut across,
like so...

254
00:15:12,483 --> 00:15:15,942
How could you become
exhausted so easily, my lady?

255
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,608
Your dancing is exquisite.
Like a lovely little robin...

256
00:15:22,692 --> 00:15:24,025
My sweet lady.

257
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,275
Young mistress... Allow me to
fetch you something to drink.

258
00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:32,817
Uh, good evening...
my Lord Druit.

259
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:37,817
I do hope you're enjoying
the party... Dear robin.

260
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,025
Oh yes, certainly.
It's a wonderful party...!

261
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:44,275
But... My lord...
I've been waiting

262
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:46,858
to speak with you all evening.

263
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:48,067
Oh?

264
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,608
I'm bored to death of
dancing and eating.

265
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:55,108
What a spoiled princess
you are, little robin.

266
00:15:55,192 --> 00:15:58,275
Looking for something
more entertaining?

267
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,108
Endure it... Ciel,
you can do this...

268
00:16:03,192 --> 00:16:06,108
You have no choice now.
After all those horrible...

269
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:09,400
horrible lessons
...You can handle it!

270
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:11,942
You know of
other amusements...?

271
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:13,358
I'd be most interested.

272
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:16,733
Of course. I'd be happy to
show them to you, robin...

273
00:16:16,817 --> 00:16:18,358
My sweet little thing.

274
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:23,400
When this is all over, I swear
I'm going to kill this creep!

275
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,483
Oh really? Like what?

276
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,900
I have to find out his secret
before this dance is over.

277
00:16:28,983 --> 00:16:31,942
What? She sees me!

278
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:33,983
You want to know?

279
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:36,483
Yes, I'm simply
dying to, my lord.

280
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:38,525
If Elizabeth comes
this way, I'm doomed!

281
00:16:38,608 --> 00:16:40,858
You might be
a bit young, yet.

282
00:16:40,942 --> 00:16:42,442
Hurry!

283
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:45,650
Now, don't tease me, my lord.
I'm a lady, not a little girl.

284
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:46,983
Hurry!

285
00:16:48,983 --> 00:16:50,233
The dance is over.

286
00:16:52,358 --> 00:16:54,025
She's coming!

287
00:16:54,108 --> 00:16:56,608
What has you so distracted,
my delightful butterfly?

288
00:16:56,692 --> 00:17:01,442
Uh-I-it's nothing...
This is it. My life is over!

289
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:12,858
Ladies and gentlemen, if you
would all please gather 'round,

290
00:17:12,942 --> 00:17:15,108
this evening's magic
show will now begin.

291
00:17:16,483 --> 00:17:19,108
Pardon me, sir... would
you please assist me?

292
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:22,067
Assist you...? Certainly.

293
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,275
I don't recall scheduling any
parlor tricks this evening.

294
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:26,733
Now's my chance.

295
00:17:26,817 --> 00:17:29,650
My lord... I've seen more
than enough parlor tricks...

296
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:31,317
Can we go...? Please?

297
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,983
Ugh, this is awful!

298
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:35,067
Yes, anything for you,
my sweet.

299
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:40,400
Right this way, dear.

300
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:47,817
A normal cabinet, once I've
climbed inside shut it tightly

301
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,025
and bind it with
these chains.

302
00:17:50,108 --> 00:17:53,442
Then, ...Simply run it
through with the swords.

303
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,692
I shall emerge
perfectly unharmed...

304
00:17:57,775 --> 00:17:59,900
This is no mere
trick or illusion.

305
00:17:59,983 --> 00:18:02,608
Prepare for a performance
of true magic.

306
00:18:06,775 --> 00:18:08,483
Well, here goes nothing.

307
00:18:25,108 --> 00:18:27,067
Amazing! True magic!

308
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:27,983
Bravo!

309
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:30,108
Sebastian...!
How incredible!

310
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,525
Indeed! ... For a moment there,
I worried I'd killed you.

311
00:18:33,608 --> 00:18:36,317
It actually hurt
more than expected...

312
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,942
I didn't think you would
aim straight for my head...

313
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:40,900
Anyone else would have died.

314
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:43,150
So, what's the trick
to it anyway?

315
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:45,900
You stabbed him that many
times without knowing?!

316
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:48,650
Like I told you...

317
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:51,983
There were no tricks or
illusions. Just magic.

318
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:57,025
We're going somewhere I'm sure
you'll find very amusing...

319
00:18:57,108 --> 00:19:00,567
I know I do. Please.

320
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:08,108
What is that smell...?
It's suffocating. Damn him.

321
00:19:12,983 --> 00:19:18,858
See... aren't you enjoying
yourself... Little robin.

322
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:27,567
S-Sebastian!

323
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,567
Please hold on a little
longer, sir... You can do it.

324
00:19:34,983 --> 00:19:36,983
That's it. You're
going to kill me!

325
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:38,317
I doubt any woman
has ever been

326
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,525
killed by
a corset alone.

327
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:47,525
And now what you've
all been waiting for:

328
00:19:47,608 --> 00:19:49,692
Tonight's crown jewel.

329
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,858
I'm sure she'd make a
lovely decoration...

330
00:19:55,942 --> 00:19:59,858
or a sweet little pet... You can
keep her whole and healthy...

331
00:19:59,942 --> 00:20:02,692
Or sell her for parts
if you'd like to.

332
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:05,275
Her eyes are two different
colors, but for the discerning

333
00:20:05,358 --> 00:20:08,358
collector, that will add
to her unique attraction.

334
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:09,983
A black market auction?

335
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:12,108
The bidding shall
begin momentarily.

336
00:20:12,192 --> 00:20:15,192
So that's what he's doing...?
He removes the prostitutes'

337
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:17,400
organs and sells them
at his parties?

338
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,525
We'll start at
a thousand guineas.

339
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:20,650
2000!

340
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:21,817
3000!

341
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,442
Thirty-five hundred!

342
00:20:23,525 --> 00:20:25,067
5000!

343
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,567
Sebastian...come get me now.

344
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:32,067
What's this?

345
00:20:41,108 --> 00:20:44,067
Really, sir. Are you
good for nothing but

346
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,525
getting yourself
captured...? How sad.

347
00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:49,733
As long as the contract
remains in place,

348
00:20:49,817 --> 00:20:51,650
you'll follow me everywhere
whether I ask you to

349
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:53,483
or not, won't you?

350
00:20:53,567 --> 00:20:55,900
This type of 'contract'
is sealed by a mark

351
00:20:55,983 --> 00:20:58,317
a demon places on his prey.

352
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
The more noticeably
placed the mark is,

353
00:21:00,483 --> 00:21:03,192
the tighter the demon and prey
are bound to one another...

354
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:05,692
The demon serves...

355
00:21:05,775 --> 00:21:09,317
...and in exchange,
the prey can never escape.

356
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:17,067
Yes... I will be with you
everywhere... until the end.

357
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,608
I shall be at your
side, no matter what...

358
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:22,567
Even should I perish in this
world, I'll still be there...

359
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,150
In the very depths
of hell, my lord.

360
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:29,400
This is how I differ from
humans... I do not lie.

361
00:21:32,442 --> 00:21:37,150
Good. You will never lie to me,
no matter what... Understood?

362
00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:39,733
Yes...my young master.

363
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,317
I suppose this solves the
Jack the Ripper case.

364
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:48,400
Well, that was easier
than I had expected.

365
00:21:50,525 --> 00:21:53,817
I imagine Scotland Yard will
be here before much longer...

366
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,692
We should take our leave.

367
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,108
Well, miss, are you ready?

368
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:16,692
I could have sworn
I saw something up there.

369
00:22:19,275 --> 00:22:21,067
I guess I was wrong.

370
00:22:24,358 --> 00:22:27,233
"Jack the Ripper
strikes again?"

371
00:22:27,317 --> 00:22:29,775
So the viscount
wasn't our man after all.

372
00:24:11,358 --> 00:24:12,900
At last, we are finally
about to solve

373
00:24:12,983 --> 00:24:14,650
the serial
prostitute murders...

374
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:17,400
Who is this mysterious
perpetrator, Jack the Ripper,

375
00:24:17,483 --> 00:24:18,900
and what does he want...?

376
00:24:18,983 --> 00:24:21,150
I have a feeling the answers
to those questions will come

377
00:24:21,233 --> 00:24:23,317
as quite a shock
to my poor master...

378
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,775
He is still a naïve child,
after all...

379
00:24:25,858 --> 00:24:28,317
When we've wrapped everything
up, I'll have to make him

380
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,442
a nice, soothing dessert
to take his mind off things.

381
00:24:31,525 --> 00:24:34,233
Next time,
on Black Butler...

382
00:24:34,317 --> 00:24:36,525
"His Butler, Chance Encounter."

383
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,233
You see... I am simply
one hell of a butler.
