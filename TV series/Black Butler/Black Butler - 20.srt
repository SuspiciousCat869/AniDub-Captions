1
00:00:19,608 --> 00:00:24,108
"One night... Zhuang Zhou
dreamt he was a butterfly.

2
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:27,483
He was a happily
fluttering butterfly.

3
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:31,775
It was so much fun. He could
fly wherever he wanted.

4
00:00:31,858 --> 00:00:34,733
And he had no thought
of being Zhou.

5
00:00:37,442 --> 00:00:39,525
But suddenly he woke up...

6
00:00:39,608 --> 00:00:43,067
and was startled to find
that he was human.

7
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,442
He couldn't decide. Was he
Zhou who'd just dreamt

8
00:00:47,525 --> 00:00:51,150
he was a butterfly?
Or a butterfly who was

9
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:53,983
now dreaming he was Zhou?

10
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:56,442
Surely there must be
some distinction between

11
00:00:56,525 --> 00:00:58,483
Zhou and the butterfly.

12
00:01:00,317 --> 00:01:03,358
This is called "the
transformation of things."

13
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:07,358
Just ignore me.

14
00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:50,567
Pretty!

15
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,817
You're going to confess
to your crimes eventually,

16
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,858
you know, so you might as
well do it soon, Sebastian.

17
00:02:57,608 --> 00:02:59,483
Very well then, I confess.

18
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:01,733
It was I who was
responsible for the outbreak

19
00:03:01,817 --> 00:03:03,525
of the Black Death in Europe.

20
00:03:03,608 --> 00:03:05,025
What?

21
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:08,817
As I recall, it was during
the reign of Edward III.

22
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,317
You think this is a joke?

23
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,150
That was over
five hundred years ago!

24
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,733
Give him as much pain
as you like.

25
00:03:17,817 --> 00:03:19,358
Yes sir.

26
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:22,567
Goodie... If you
confess I don't get

27
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,025
to have my fun, you see.

28
00:03:26,983 --> 00:03:30,358
Oh, look at those perfect
eyes...! Should I poke em,

29
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:31,900
do you think, or should
I just cut em out

30
00:03:31,983 --> 00:03:37,067
of your pretty head?
No. Save the best for last.

31
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,442
How bout... First we
hear a nice scream...

32
00:03:40,525 --> 00:03:41,942
handsome?

33
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:51,025
Your tea, sir.

34
00:03:59,858 --> 00:04:01,400
Are you alright?

35
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:12,817
Is it any good...? you know
I used to do a lot of work

36
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,317
around the tea ships
down at the dock.

37
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,525
I thought you
were an inspector.

38
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:20,900
Yes, but I was raised
in the East End...

39
00:04:20,983 --> 00:04:23,067
no parents or siblings
to rely on...

40
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,483
So I did what work
came my way, to survive.

41
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:29,983
In that case, you've certainly
done well for yourself.

42
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:31,942
Tell me the truth now, Ciel...

43
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:35,067
You really don't have anything
to do with the drugs...

44
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,108
do you... Or with
the Queen's letter.

45
00:04:39,192 --> 00:04:41,525
Finally beginning
your interrogation?

46
00:04:41,608 --> 00:04:43,108
Not really...

47
00:04:43,192 --> 00:04:46,067
The Commissioner's instruction
was just to confine you here.

48
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,692
Then I would recommend that
you don't try to get involved...

49
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:50,358
This game is between
me and whoever it is

50
00:04:50,442 --> 00:04:51,858
pulling the strings.
So why don't you just

51
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:55,525
sit there and follow orders
like the good pawn you are.

52
00:04:55,608 --> 00:04:58,483
That's the secret to long
life and quick promotion.

53
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:00,317
Yes. I know...

54
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:04,942
Hey, if you wanna give up your
territory to the Ferro family,

55
00:05:05,025 --> 00:05:07,025
we'll be happy to
accept it from him,

56
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:08,358
there's no doubt about that...

57
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:11,817
But I thought you worked
for the Queen's dog...

58
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,358
and I heard he just got
himself captured.

59
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:16,942
You sure you want
to just desert him?

60
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,358
The butterfly drinks
from the flower,

61
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:21,483
just as the flower spreads
its pollen by attracting

62
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:23,900
the butterfly.

63
00:05:23,983 --> 00:05:26,567
Should the bloom be plucked
for its beauty...

64
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,942
ending this beautiful
cycle of life...

65
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:31,608
Would the butterfly
mourn the flower?

66
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:36,108
I suppose the butterfly would
find a new flower, yes?

67
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:38,775
Thankfully, this world
is full of flowerbeds.

68
00:05:38,858 --> 00:05:41,233
And don't forget,
this was your doing.

69
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:43,817
Just as Stanley
was your doing...

70
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,025
Let's not throw stones.

71
00:05:46,108 --> 00:05:49,067
Yes, you're quite right...
Signor Corraro.

72
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,817
I wish you a smooth
journey... Mr. Lau

73
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,025
Do you know, Ranmao...

74
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:59,650
I couldn't be happier
to be leaving here...

75
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:02,900
I find these peaceful days
to be dreadfully boring.

76
00:06:05,483 --> 00:06:06,775
Liar.

77
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:26,733
So it's a tea ship, again.

78
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:36,567
Opium... the Chinese...
and a tea ship...

79
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,567
What a sad coincidence. It's
the Opium wars all over again.

80
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,733
You make quite
a picture, Sebastian.

81
00:06:58,817 --> 00:07:01,067
So this is how far you'll go...

82
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,317
to be loyal to the master
who put you here.

83
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,483
Between my master and myself...

84
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:09,025
Such are the terms
of my contract

85
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:34,233
Ciel...! Where are you going?

86
00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:36,358
I'm simply tired of
this confinement.

87
00:07:36,442 --> 00:07:38,483
I thought I'd take
a little walk.

88
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:40,483
What is it you think
you can accomplish

89
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:43,317
on your own?

90
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Do not underestimate
the Phantomhives.

91
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:48,692
Have you any idea just how
many years the members

92
00:07:48,775 --> 00:07:51,983
of my family have held sway
in the underworld...?

93
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:54,775
I still have all
of the pawns I need.

94
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:56,233
You mean the same lot
you've been trying to get

95
00:07:56,317 --> 00:07:58,067
in touch with for days?

96
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,025
None of them has reached out...
they have left you all alone.

97
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,400
Am I wrong...? Ciel.

98
00:08:06,483 --> 00:08:08,317
The boy must be gnashing
his teeth right now,

99
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,483
don't you think...?

100
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:12,650
Having been shown
his own powerlessness.

101
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:14,983
Yes, I imagine
that you're right.

102
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:17,025
Fear and profit...

103
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:20,317
Those are the only ties that
bind in the underworld...

104
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,983
And I'm afraid you can provide
neither at the moment.

105
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:26,275
That won't hold
me back for long.

106
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:30,442
Even if all his pawns are
taken from him... forever...

107
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:32,233
Even if the only
piece left to me...

108
00:08:32,317 --> 00:08:34,567
the only player still
under my control,

109
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,275
is the King...

110
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:38,442
He will never pull
out of the game...

111
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:41,483
That's my master's nature...
You should know that.

112
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,983
Why not just admit your own
nature and start acting

113
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,858
on your own desires?

114
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,108
This is harder on you
than you'll say...

115
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:51,108
How long has it been,
Sebastian...? Since you last

116
00:08:51,192 --> 00:08:53,067
devoured the soul of a human...

117
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,192
And now you're
injured, as well.

118
00:08:56,525 --> 00:08:59,775
You must be beyond
ravenous by now.

119
00:08:59,858 --> 00:09:03,067
Shall we make a deal, then...?
The true Doomsday

120
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,733
will arrive in due time.

121
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:06,858
When it does,

122
00:09:06,942 --> 00:09:08,525
you can have
as many souls as you like.

123
00:09:08,608 --> 00:09:11,567
All you have to do
is give me that boy.

124
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,358
I believe I'll decline.

125
00:09:14,442 --> 00:09:17,900
My palette grows weary
of simple unclean souls

126
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:23,400
I crave ambrosia. My master
is the only one I want...

127
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:25,983
I desire to eat no other soul.

128
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,942
Well. It seems our negotiations
have broken down, then...

129
00:09:32,025 --> 00:09:33,525
Such a shame.

130
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:40,942
Ye unclean... ye unnecessary...
ye unwanted...

131
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:44,733
Perish and be cleansed...!
The pain you feel

132
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:47,275
is God's purifying fire!

133
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:53,067
Ahhhh! This pain is but
the spice I shall use...

134
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,192
Offer up your blood
for your sin!

135
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:57,358
My blood, but the sauce...

136
00:09:57,442 --> 00:10:00,817
That cursed soul must be
purged... with flame!!

137
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:09,650
To flavor that solitary,
defiled soul... Bless him.

138
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,983
If I can no longer rely on
anyone's help, so be it.

139
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:19,317
I was born to end up alone.

140
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,567
It's the fate delivered
to me by the cursed house

141
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,358
of Phantomhive...

142
00:10:23,442 --> 00:10:26,650
You wouldn't understand,
Abberline.

143
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,317
I understand that
you're talking about

144
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,192
your parents' murder.

145
00:10:31,317 --> 00:10:34,942
I read your file... And
Randall told me the rest...

146
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:39,692
I know everything. I know
you're the Queen's guard dog.

147
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:41,733
and that you run the
criminal underworld.

148
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:42,900
Well then...

149
00:10:42,983 --> 00:10:46,108
There's nothing more
to say... Is there?

150
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:47,817
Why do you insist
on doing this alone?

151
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,817
Why won't you ask
anyone for help!?

152
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,067
I don't need anyone
on my side. I'm the one

153
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,900
playing the game...
All I need are my pawns.

154
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:58,275
I'll be on your side.

155
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:08,442
Me... I'll be on your side,
Ciel... I will.

156
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:10,567
Why are you doing this?

157
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:22,983
You're a fool.

158
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:24,817
If anyone finds out about
this you'll lose more

159
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,858
than just your job.

160
00:11:26,942 --> 00:11:28,608
I'm getting married,
you know.

161
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:31,358
And what does that
have to do with anything?

162
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:34,275
Not long after that,
I am to be a father as well.

163
00:11:35,608 --> 00:11:37,983
That's why I want to make
this country better and safer

164
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:40,150
for every one of us
who lives in it...

165
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:43,150
my child deserves a peaceful
country with no need...

166
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:44,858
for a guard dog.

167
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:47,025
It's not just
the tea ships that have

168
00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:48,358
outlived their day.

169
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:51,358
We need to change
with the times, Ciel.

170
00:11:51,442 --> 00:11:53,150
You're serious, aren't you?

171
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:56,108
Of course I am...
What'll change us is faith...

172
00:11:56,192 --> 00:11:58,983
faith in tomorrow... faith
that we can make it better.

173
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:00,650
That's how society evolves.

174
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:03,692
Just who the hell are you?

175
00:12:03,775 --> 00:12:06,733
Fred Abberline... Detective.

176
00:12:06,817 --> 00:12:08,525
Abby! My boy!

177
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:09,608
What is it, ma'am?

178
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:12,150
I've found someone...
Someone who says

179
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:14,608
he witnessed the murder
down at the docks.

180
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:17,400
A Chinese girl?

181
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:19,567
Aye, and she was
a lovely one, she was...

182
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,608
I thought she was
the Cutty Sark come back

183
00:12:21,692 --> 00:12:22,692
from the dead.

184
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:25,900
A Chinese girl.
What a coincidence.

185
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,858
Did you tell anyone else
about this?

186
00:12:27,942 --> 00:12:29,692
I told Havock about it,
when I seen it,

187
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:32,358
and a dandy of a fellow
in white.

188
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:34,483
He really was quite
a dapper gentlemen, he was.

189
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:37,358
When I told him about the girl
I saw he said I was a good boy

190
00:12:37,442 --> 00:12:40,108
with a pure heart,
and then he gave me this!

191
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,983
Give it to me!

192
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:45,983
You work for the Ferros,
don't you?

193
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:48,483
I--I'll get you
your money soon, I swear...

194
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,067
Now please!
Give it to me!

195
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,567
Hey!

196
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,400
Let's have a little chat.

197
00:13:00,858 --> 00:13:02,525
So...

198
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:06,233
Now the entire East End
territory belongs to me.

199
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:13,608
Damn it! Boss!

200
00:13:15,858 --> 00:13:17,858
Corraro... are you
the bastard who replaced

201
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:19,858
the product in
my warehouse with opium

202
00:13:19,942 --> 00:13:21,608
disguised as sweets?

203
00:13:21,692 --> 00:13:23,817
I haven't the faintest id--

204
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,317
Children can be very impatient.

205
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,067
Alright, it was me.

206
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,858
And were you responsible
for John Stanley,

207
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:30,942
as well?

208
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:34,983
No that was Lau,
I swear it wasn't me!

209
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:37,442
Stanley was one
of our suppliers.

210
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,900
We both bought his product...
but the idiot tried

211
00:13:40,983 --> 00:13:43,025
to blackmail Lau
and got himself killed

212
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:47,275
by Lau's little tigress
for his trouble.

213
00:13:47,358 --> 00:13:50,358
Come to think of it...
Lau told me you were

214
00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:54,400
in some trouble of your own,
and that's why he was running.

215
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:56,858
I hear he got something
valuable off of Stanley

216
00:13:56,942 --> 00:13:58,525
before he left, though.

217
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:00,858
So... It was Lau.

218
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,775
Ciel!

219
00:14:06,983 --> 00:14:09,567
How strange...

220
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,567
I heard the Phantomhives
stopped at nothing

221
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,525
to get their way, is this
the best you can do?

222
00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:17,025
Yes, that is true...
This isn't like me...

223
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:18,942
Not at all, actually.

224
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,358
What now?

225
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:24,400
I forgot. There are no
fast rules in this world...

226
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:27,400
Or if there are, then I'm
the one who makes them.

227
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:30,817
In my name, and that
of my defiled family,

228
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,817
I command you...
Come, Sebastian!!

229
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,650
At last.

230
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:50,442
Finish them off!

231
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,567
You're late.

232
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:04,650
Yes, sir...

233
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:07,192
And I've been waiting
quite a while, as well.

234
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:09,692
I let that soft-hearted fool
get under my skin

235
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:13,025
and infect me... but
it won't happen again.

236
00:15:13,108 --> 00:15:15,025
I want you to help me
go after Lau...

237
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:17,442
What use are pawns who
defy those who wield them?

238
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:21,067
Are you certain about this,
my lord...? Think carefully...

239
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,692
You won't be able
to take back this order.

240
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:26,358
I will not suffer those
who stand in my way.

241
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:30,942
Not even friends or family...
Is that understood?

242
00:15:31,025 --> 00:15:32,650
Yes, my young lord.

243
00:15:33,608 --> 00:15:35,442
Ciel!

244
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:37,567
You should keep your
distance from me...

245
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,900
If you want to live.

246
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:42,733
My place is in the shadows,
yours in the light...

247
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,525
We walk opposite
paths, Abberline,

248
00:15:44,608 --> 00:15:46,317
it's best you remember that.

249
00:15:50,192 --> 00:15:52,150
Hey... What is that?!

250
00:15:59,817 --> 00:16:00,817
Cannon!

251
00:16:10,692 --> 00:16:13,567
Ah, yes... so you've
come at last, have you...?

252
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,525
That's why I'm so fond
of you, my dear little Earl...

253
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,150
You do play your part.

254
00:16:22,192 --> 00:16:23,608
Let's go, Sebastian.

255
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:24,817
Yes.

256
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,067
Go on... I'll take her.

257
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,817
Very well.

258
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,275
You're my master's
enemy... You die.

259
00:16:55,358 --> 00:16:57,358
We'll have to see about that.

260
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,358
I see that you've
finally found your way

261
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:16,067
to this humble place...
my dear Earl.

262
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,192
It feels strange
we should meet under such

263
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:20,192
questionable circumstances.

264
00:17:20,275 --> 00:17:22,650
And yet, inevitable, don't you
think, like we always knew

265
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:25,025
someday it might come to this.

266
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:27,025
Perhaps you're right
about that. Lau.

267
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:28,233
By the way...

268
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:31,150
what you're looking for
is right over there.

269
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:32,650
What do you suppose it is?...

270
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:35,400
It's actually quite
a fascinating document.

271
00:17:35,483 --> 00:17:37,317
It's a diplomatic
treatise proposing

272
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,608
a military alliance
with Germany and Italy.

273
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,150
Yes... It would appear
that your beloved Queen

274
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:45,150
is trying to plunge Europe,
not to mention

275
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:48,150
the rest of the world,
into full-scale war.

276
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,775
I suppose... she'll trigger it
by attacking France

277
00:17:50,858 --> 00:17:52,733
through the opium trade
with this new drug,

278
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:55,067
Lady Blanc...
Just as your country

279
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,525
invaded my own by inundating it
with opium not so long ago,

280
00:17:58,608 --> 00:18:00,233
leading to the Opium Wars.

281
00:18:01,692 --> 00:18:03,650
Do you think you'll still
be her little guard dog

282
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,525
when the guns
start firing, my lord?

283
00:18:05,608 --> 00:18:08,983
Is that why you betrayed me?
You're a pacifist?

284
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:11,150
Oh-ho dear me, no.

285
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:12,900
Then why?!

286
00:18:12,983 --> 00:18:15,025
I was just
your pawn remember?

287
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:17,483
The only tie that
ever bound us was profit,

288
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:18,733
my little lord.

289
00:18:18,817 --> 00:18:22,233
And you see, lately...
I've been a bit bored.

290
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:26,692
I was bored being just
a pawn, so I decided it was

291
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:28,983
time to be a player
in a new game.

292
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,733
A game with both
our lives on the line.

293
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:42,942
Your small body houses
magnificent reserves of power,

294
00:18:43,025 --> 00:18:45,858
however, in the end,
you're still human...

295
00:18:45,942 --> 00:18:48,900
If you prefer we could
call an end to this now.

296
00:18:48,983 --> 00:18:51,150
No. No end.

297
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:52,858
Sebastian!

298
00:18:52,942 --> 00:18:55,608
I never thought I'd see
Ranmao's strength pushed

299
00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:59,358
this far... It just proves
what I've always suspected.

300
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:01,983
You're not truly human,
are you, butler?

301
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:03,650
You may believe
what you like...

302
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:07,150
I am simply...
one hell of a butler.

303
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:11,483
Interesting... Very
interesting indeed, my lord...

304
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,567
But can a world
so interesting be reality?

305
00:19:15,942 --> 00:19:18,483
Sometimes I catch myself
wondering if I have,

306
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:20,650
in fact, been living nothing
but a dream ever since

307
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:22,233
that fateful day.

308
00:19:23,317 --> 00:19:24,858
"He couldn't decide...

309
00:19:24,942 --> 00:19:28,025
Was he Zhou who'd just
dreamt he was a butterfly?"

310
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:33,400
Or a butterfly who was
now dreaming he was Zhou?

311
00:19:33,483 --> 00:19:35,067
Sebastian!

312
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,525
I won't let you.

313
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:50,067
You fool... Damn you...

314
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,525
Get away, Ciel...

315
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,858
You're in my way... Inspector.

316
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:20,650
Magnificent, my lord...
you win by virtue...

317
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:23,108
of... your vice...

318
00:20:23,192 --> 00:20:25,233
Why, Lau...? Tell me.

319
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:27,108
The match is over.

320
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,942
You've won quite handily,
as expected...

321
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:32,608
I never had what it takes
to play the game,

322
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:34,400
I suppose.

323
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:43,817
Come, Ranmao.

324
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,483
If the world is only
a butterfly's dream...

325
00:20:46,567 --> 00:20:48,692
then let me at least
take this final moment

326
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:50,900
to admire its beauty.

327
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:08,275
Hang on, Abberline.
Just hang on!

328
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:14,650
I'm glad... Ciel... I'm glad...
that you're alright...

329
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,567
I was just... like you...
I lost my loved ones,

330
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,858
and I thought...

331
00:21:21,942 --> 00:21:24,858
I'd never be able
to get my family back...

332
00:21:24,942 --> 00:21:28,525
I thought that nothing
would ever be the same...

333
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:32,817
But I was so wrong...
You can have your family...

334
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,025
No, I can't...!
What are you saying?

335
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:39,525
You do have a chance,
Ciel... to move forward,

336
00:21:39,608 --> 00:21:43,733
and build a brand new
future for yourself...

337
00:21:43,817 --> 00:21:48,400
Don't you ever forget that...
Promise. You won't.

338
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:55,942
But there is no future for me.
Because, I gave it away.

339
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,233
Master?

340
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:02,692
You didn't hold up
your end of the bargain...

341
00:22:02,775 --> 00:22:06,150
My life was in serious danger,
and you did nothing to save me.

342
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:09,025
You disobeyed
the rules of our contract!

343
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:12,150
Because you were
perfectly safe, master.

344
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:15,983
You didn't get hurt, did you?
Of course not...

345
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:17,983
I knew, in that moment,
you wouldn't...

346
00:22:18,067 --> 00:22:20,650
that Abberline would use
his body to sh--

347
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,025
Abberline...

348
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:31,192
You fool... Damn you.

349
00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:36,733
Yes. What a fool.

350
00:24:10,692 --> 00:24:14,192
Oh my... So you want
to know about my past...

351
00:24:14,275 --> 00:24:17,067
Not a particularly interesting
tale I must admit.

352
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,317
But if you insist
I did have another master

353
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,983
before my current one.
That master was...

354
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:27,483
Oh dear look at the time!
I'm afraid that's all for today.

355
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,275
You'll to do a bit more
leg work if you want

356
00:24:29,358 --> 00:24:31,650
additional information.

357
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:33,692
Next time, on Black Butler:

358
00:24:33,775 --> 00:24:35,733
"His Butler,
Engaging Servants..."

359
00:24:35,817 --> 00:24:38,525
You see, I am simply
one hell of a butler.
