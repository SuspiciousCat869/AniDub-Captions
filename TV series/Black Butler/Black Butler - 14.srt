1
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,483
Young master...
he has made his move.

2
00:00:21,567 --> 00:00:22,817
Good. Let's follow him.

3
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,900
Take me with you!

4
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,150
You? Why?

5
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:28,108
I know that Agni's
been sneaking out

6
00:00:28,192 --> 00:00:29,608
after I fall asleep...

7
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:32,317
I want to know
what he's been up to...

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,817
That's my right.

9
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:14,275
A nice place.
Who lives here?

10
00:02:14,358 --> 00:02:17,358
This estate belongs
to Harold West Jeb.

11
00:02:17,442 --> 00:02:19,650
He imports a wide range
of goods from India...

12
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:22,233
He also owns various
stores, coffee houses,

13
00:02:22,317 --> 00:02:23,483
and the like...

14
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:25,692
I've met him once. He's
disgustingly obsessed

15
00:02:25,775 --> 00:02:27,483
with his social status.

16
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:28,983
People at one of
his businesses

17
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:32,025
have been found trussed-up
and hung upside down...

18
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:33,900
Mr. West happened
to be away at the time,

19
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:35,525
however, so,
fortunately for him,

20
00:02:35,608 --> 00:02:38,067
he managed to
escape unharmed.

21
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:41,775
My, isn't he lucky.

22
00:02:41,858 --> 00:02:43,525
Shall we have a look?

23
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:44,817
Indeed.

24
00:02:56,192 --> 00:02:58,733
Why not relax with
a nice Scotch?

25
00:02:58,817 --> 00:03:01,858
An excellent one from
Justerini and Brooks.

26
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:04,233
They hold the
Royal Warrant, you know.

27
00:03:07,483 --> 00:03:11,983
Our plan has been perfect so
far. You've done well for me,

28
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:15,608
Agni. I think we've
done all we need to...

29
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:18,400
Stringing up anyone else
won't be necessary.

30
00:03:21,025 --> 00:03:22,733
With this blessed
hand of yours...

31
00:03:22,817 --> 00:03:24,650
the Royal Warrant
may as well already be

32
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:27,108
in my pocket.

33
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:31,483
A Royal Warrant...?
That's what this is?

34
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:36,567
If I carry out the plan as
promised... Then Mina...?

35
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,567
Where's Mina?!

36
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,983
What the--?

37
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:40,192
My prince!

38
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,775
West is almost certain
to recognize us....

39
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,233
We must stay back.

40
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:48,358
What is this...?!

41
00:03:48,442 --> 00:03:51,400
You've known where Mina
was all along, Agni?!

42
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:54,692
I see... This intrusive
young man is your master?

43
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:58,067
And you are the man
who took Mina away...!

44
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,525
Get him...! Do you hear me?

45
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,025
What are you waiting for?!

46
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:09,150
Let's grab that idiot
prince and

47
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:10,692
get out of here
right now.

48
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:13,525
But West'll recognize you
as soon as you walk in.

49
00:04:13,608 --> 00:04:15,108
I'll take care of it.

50
00:04:15,192 --> 00:04:16,442
Well, Agni...

51
00:04:16,525 --> 00:04:18,608
are you going to take
care of this brat for me?

52
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:19,733
This brat?!

53
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:25,233
Well?

54
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:31,817
Agni!

55
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:41,275
Deer?

56
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,108
A deer-man?
What's going on here?!

57
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:48,775
Yes, thank you
for stating the obvious.

58
00:04:48,858 --> 00:04:52,650
I am a deer...
I've come for the prince.

59
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:55,900
He's a foreign spy... Get him!

60
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:57,983
No... I am simply
one hell of a dee--

61
00:04:58,067 --> 00:04:59,733
Kill him!

62
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:02,942
Do something or
our agreement is over!

63
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:04,233
Now!

64
00:05:09,983 --> 00:05:11,358
Since I was reborn...

65
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:15,025
I have had only one
god and master...

66
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:19,067
I vowed that I'd never swing
my fist for anyone but him...

67
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,983
I am guilty of betraying that
vow... Please forgive me!

68
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:25,150
Don't do it... Agni!

69
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:39,108
The crystal glasses I bought
at Thomas Goode!

70
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:40,525
Do you know what
those are worth?!

71
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:42,358
Her Majesty specifically
granted them a warrant!

72
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,275
Sounds like trouble...
Perhaps we should leave now.

73
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,442
Come my lord,
it's time to go.

74
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:51,275
Hey...! We're drawing
too much attention...!

75
00:05:51,358 --> 00:05:53,900
Grab the kid and get out
of here, Sebastian.

76
00:05:54,983 --> 00:05:55,983
Yes, sir.

77
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:07,733
With that kind of punch...

78
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:10,150
this fellow is no
ordinary human being.

79
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:12,900
It's a mental technique he
uses called Samadhi...

80
00:06:12,983 --> 00:06:15,775
When he gets like that,
no one can touch him.

81
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:17,442
Never heard of it.

82
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:19,692
I imagine it's
a type of trance...

83
00:06:19,775 --> 00:06:22,358
Agni has absolute faith
in his master...

84
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:24,775
Consequently, from that faith
he is able to produce

85
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:26,525
superhuman power.

86
00:06:26,608 --> 00:06:28,483
His skills are born of
something we can never

87
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:30,983
understand: the power of
complete love and trust

88
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:32,567
in another person.

89
00:06:33,692 --> 00:06:36,733
But this betrayal...
why would he do it?!

90
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:40,025
Why do the people close
to me always leave?!

91
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:44,567
Prince Soma!

92
00:06:45,692 --> 00:06:48,692
All of them... but why?!

93
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,150
Oh... just look at the
Haviland tea set I ordered...

94
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:58,983
So well suited to my master...

95
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:01,608
Children...! It seems
this one in particular

96
00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:04,317
will require some
personal disciplining.

97
00:07:16,358 --> 00:07:17,817
You careless pig!

98
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,483
I'm the careless one?

99
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:22,650
You're in England,
at the estate of my master,

100
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,233
Lord Phantomhive...

101
00:07:24,317 --> 00:07:27,192
What you childishly don't seem
to recognize is that it stands,

102
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:28,817
your presence in
this house hold announce

103
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,733
a little more than a nuisance.

104
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:33,900
You're a helpless child
who can do nothing

105
00:07:33,983 --> 00:07:35,733
without Agni at his side...

106
00:07:35,817 --> 00:07:39,525
And now your pillar of
strength has left you.

107
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:42,900
You're right... I've
lost everyone now...

108
00:07:42,983 --> 00:07:45,233
everyone who mattered to me.

109
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:50,608
Lost?... You're more of
a child than I thought.

110
00:07:50,692 --> 00:07:54,400
You haven't lost anything,
prince... Don't you understand?

111
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:57,025
You can't lose what you
never had to begin with.

112
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:03,442
Status from your parents...
a palace from your parents,

113
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,733
a servant from
your parents...

114
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:09,400
Never before in your life
has anything actually

115
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:11,525
belonged to you...

116
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:13,400
Isn't that right?

117
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:14,900
It's not!

118
00:08:14,983 --> 00:08:19,275
Some part of you must have
known the truth about Agni...

119
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:21,567
But you were too much of a
coward to face that truth,

120
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,483
weren't you?

121
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:24,650
You're wrong...
You're wrong!

122
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:27,733
You're wrong!
You're wrong!

123
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:33,858
You know I'm not wrong...

124
00:08:33,942 --> 00:08:36,150
You're finally
seeing the truth...

125
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:39,067
and now you want to play
the tragic hero.

126
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,858
What a hopelessly pathetic
brat you are.

127
00:08:43,525 --> 00:08:46,025
They said they'd be with
me forever.

128
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,275
And you actually
believed that?!

129
00:08:48,358 --> 00:08:50,608
You are so naïve.
Why on earth would they

130
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:52,442
stay when they got
nothing in return?

131
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:55,483
That's something most
three-year-olds understand.

132
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:58,608
Time to face facts.
Nobody ever loved you.

133
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,900
That's enough of that.

134
00:09:01,983 --> 00:09:03,025
Master?

135
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:04,275
Who knows?

136
00:09:04,358 --> 00:09:06,608
I could have ended up
the same way as him...

137
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:09,233
If it hadn't been
for that month.

138
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:14,233
What're you talking about?

139
00:09:14,317 --> 00:09:15,525
My family...

140
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:18,108
They were killed and my home
was burned down...

141
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:21,525
I was treated worse than you
would treat any animal...

142
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:27,150
I was helpless... just a
child... But I came back...

143
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,025
To make the people who
did all that to me

144
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:31,483
suffer the same
humiliation...

145
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:34,525
And I will find them.

146
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:37,025
My parents were killed
for a reason...

147
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:39,400
If I remain the family head
and make myself

148
00:09:39,483 --> 00:09:41,733
a nuisance to the people
who hurt them,

149
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:46,108
they'll target me.
That's what I'm waiting for...

150
00:09:46,192 --> 00:09:49,067
Someday they'll come
to take my life, too.

151
00:09:50,317 --> 00:09:52,733
But why...? Why do it?

152
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:57,067
Because the alternative is
grief and melancholy...

153
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,483
If I stand still then
I might as well

154
00:09:58,567 --> 00:09:59,567
be dead with them.

155
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,692
But I'm alive and
still standing...

156
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:04,025
moving on my own two feet.

157
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:05,400
I'm going to die someday,

158
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:07,608
and I'd rather do it
without regrets...

159
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:10,608
I'm not going to pretend that
I'm doing anything noble...

160
00:10:10,692 --> 00:10:12,983
This is no grand revenge.

161
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:17,692
It's just a game... I'm
waiting to see who wins.

162
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:19,400
However far I fall,

163
00:10:19,483 --> 00:10:22,650
as long as there's so much
as a thread left to me,

164
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:26,192
I'll use it to climb...
I'll take hold of it....

165
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:27,983
and refuse to give up.

166
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:31,233
I am still human...
I can do that much.

167
00:10:32,608 --> 00:10:36,442
But every person must to decide
on his own whether to grab it.

168
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:39,400
Enough of this idle
talk... Sebastian...

169
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:42,733
We need to talk about
West now... Come.

170
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:43,900
Yes.

171
00:10:45,942 --> 00:10:50,233
Every person must decide
on his own to grab it.

172
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,817
Ciel!

173
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,150
I'm seventeen,
but you're right.

174
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:56,483
Compared to you
I am still only a child.

175
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:59,067
I'm nothing more than
a spoiled brat.

176
00:11:00,983 --> 00:11:03,858
I knew there was something
that had been bothering Agni,

177
00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:06,400
but I didn't bother
to ask, did I?

178
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:08,067
Now I want to know...

179
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,275
I want to see them in person
and ask why they left me.

180
00:11:13,442 --> 00:11:15,817
I'm begging you...
let me come!

181
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,067
Don't think so.

182
00:11:18,608 --> 00:11:21,817
You're a naïve idiot. I don't
want to chaperone you...

183
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,692
Of course... It's not like I'm
going to go to the trouble

184
00:11:24,775 --> 00:11:26,150
of locking you in here.

185
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:29,067
Thank you!

186
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:29,983
Get off!

187
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:33,317
I'm sorry I lost my
temper earlier and

188
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,150
destroyed your tea set.
Please forgive me.

189
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:40,942
Oh yeah, and you too...
I'm very sorry.

190
00:11:41,025 --> 00:11:43,817
It's all right... I find
you entertaining.

191
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:49,233
I didn't realize West was
after a Royal Warrant...

192
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:51,775
Though, given his
obsession with status,

193
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:53,400
it does make sense.

194
00:11:53,483 --> 00:11:56,150
I was wondering, what exactly
is a Royal Warrant?

195
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:59,483
It's an endorsement bestowed
by the royal family

196
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:02,067
upon their favorite vendors.
Royal Warrant holders

197
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,817
are official purveyors
to the Crown.

198
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,483
Yes, indeed...
and in one week,

199
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:08,567
a curry exhibition
will be held as part of

200
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,858
the festivities at the
Crystal Palace.

201
00:12:10,942 --> 00:12:12,817
I'm told it should be
quite the event.

202
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,067
Curry?

203
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,692
What's more... From what
I've heard, Her Majesty,

204
00:12:16,775 --> 00:12:18,442
who is widely known
to be a lover of curry,

205
00:12:18,525 --> 00:12:20,650
will be in attendance that day.

206
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:22,067
Nothing more
than rumor...

207
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,525
Ever since her husband,
Prince Albert, passed away,

208
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:26,775
Her Majesty rarely
condescends to make any

209
00:12:26,858 --> 00:12:28,275
public appearances.

210
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:30,483
What do the curry exhibition
and the recent crimes

211
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:31,817
have to do with each other?

212
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,358
The connection is the curry.

213
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:35,525
It's the specialty at
West's coffee house...

214
00:12:35,608 --> 00:12:38,317
If he obtains a Royal
Warrant for his curry,

215
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,942
his sales are sure to
increase dramatically.

216
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:44,608
My guess is he was using Agni
to target specific men...

217
00:12:44,692 --> 00:12:47,983
They were probably his rivals
for the curry exhibition.

218
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:51,317
When he hanged the men,
he included notes that

219
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,900
insulted the English...

220
00:12:52,983 --> 00:12:54,858
That was done to make it
seem as if the attacks

221
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:57,192
were carried out by
a bitter Indian...

222
00:12:57,275 --> 00:13:00,108
Likely...
Mina was West's bait...

223
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:03,525
She's probably the only
reason Agni got involved.

224
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:06,942
I'm guessing he
did it all for you.

225
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,567
You worship Kali,

226
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,858
a goddess who is depicted with
her tongue sticking out...

227
00:13:12,942 --> 00:13:16,900
Agni worships you as
his god, along with Kali.

228
00:13:16,983 --> 00:13:18,775
The connection
seems obvious...

229
00:13:18,858 --> 00:13:22,400
He signed those letters as
a way of apologizing to you.

230
00:13:22,483 --> 00:13:23,900
He may indeed have left...

231
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:26,567
but everything he does is
still for you, no one else...

232
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,317
Agni lives only for you.
He is a fine butler.

233
00:13:32,608 --> 00:13:33,983
Agni!

234
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:36,650
My, my, my, I do love
a happy ending...

235
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,317
It looks like
everything's wrapped up.

236
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,733
No need to get
more involved...

237
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:41,858
I'm sure the Yard
can handle the res--

238
00:13:41,942 --> 00:13:44,483
Wait, no...!
There's Agni and Mina...

239
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:47,025
What will happen to them?

240
00:13:47,108 --> 00:13:49,692
We know the criminal underworld
isn't involved in this...

241
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:51,942
Which means it has
nothing to do with us.

242
00:13:52,942 --> 00:13:56,233
You're right...
This is my problem...

243
00:13:56,317 --> 00:13:58,525
I need to be strong
and find a way to handle it

244
00:13:58,608 --> 00:13:59,567
on my own.

245
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,067
That's the right attitude...

246
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,108
and it affords me
the liberty to look after

247
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:04,858
my own agenda.

248
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:06,442
I was called to the
city during winter

249
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:08,608
for this idiotic case.

250
00:14:08,692 --> 00:14:10,317
I think I deserve
to be compensated

251
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,817
for the inconvenience,
don't you?

252
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,608
Thanks to West's
nefarious activities,

253
00:14:15,692 --> 00:14:18,067
the competition at the
curry exhibition this year

254
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,358
will be considerably slimmer
than it normally would be.

255
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:23,275
So perhaps the Phantomhive
Company should

256
00:14:23,358 --> 00:14:26,692
enter its own curry...
We'd only have to beat West...

257
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:30,608
Then the Royal Warrant
would fall into our hands.

258
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:32,858
I was already considering
expanding into

259
00:14:32,942 --> 00:14:35,067
the food industry anyway...

260
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,192
Winning a Royal Warrant
for our curry would

261
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:38,483
generate some buzz...

262
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:40,608
It would be an excellent
way to get started.

263
00:14:40,692 --> 00:14:42,983
But you only have a week
before the contest...

264
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:44,775
Can you find an adequate
curry chef and

265
00:14:44,858 --> 00:14:46,483
gather equipment in time.

266
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:48,942
I don't think that
will be necessary.

267
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:51,733
Isn't that right... Sebastian?

268
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,108
If I couldn't make a good
curry for my master...

269
00:14:56,192 --> 00:14:58,650
then what kind of butler
would I be...?

270
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:00,608
I shall secure
the royal warra-

271
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,650
Impossible.

272
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:04,192
There's no way
you can win...

273
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:06,275
They have Agni
cooking for them.

274
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:10,817
And his hand was blessed
by the goddess Kali.

275
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:24,442
Yes, I'm willing
to admit that Agni is

276
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:26,150
a remarkable fighter,

277
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:29,567
but this is a cooking
competition... It's not combat.

278
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,067
That's what I'm saying...

279
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,733
None of you have even
glimpsed Agni's

280
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:34,275
true power yet.

281
00:15:34,358 --> 00:15:36,525
You don't know
real curry... No!

282
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:38,483
What is this
'real curry'?

283
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,692
The key to curry is the
mixture of spices...

284
00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:47,942
The possibilities
are infinite...

285
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:51,817
Choosing the right one
is a very difficult task.

286
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,567
It is... like trying to find

287
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:57,858
one truth in a vast universe.
But Agni can do it...

288
00:15:57,942 --> 00:16:00,650
He creates worlds
out of nothingness.

289
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:03,900
His power is on the same
plane as the gods'...

290
00:16:03,983 --> 00:16:05,733
That's why he's known as...

291
00:16:05,817 --> 00:16:09,233
The Godly Right Hand of Kali.

292
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:11,858
Never in my life have
I tasted a bowl of curry

293
00:16:11,942 --> 00:16:14,025
that could even begin
to compare to his.

294
00:16:14,108 --> 00:16:15,400
How interesting...

295
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:18,942
Agni's true power is
creating the curry of Kali.

296
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:22,858
Well, what do you think?

297
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:28,233
Fascinating indeed...
It sounds like a challenge.

298
00:16:30,692 --> 00:16:33,400
You, uh... you made all
these yourself, really?

299
00:16:33,483 --> 00:16:35,900
Yes...You're the only
one on the estate

300
00:16:35,983 --> 00:16:38,233
who's ever tasted
Agni's curry before...

301
00:16:38,317 --> 00:16:40,858
I'd like you to perform
a taste-test for me.

302
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:45,525
Which one should we use
to defeat your butler?

303
00:16:45,608 --> 00:16:47,317
Yes, okay. I will...

304
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,608
If I can repay your
kindness by eating curry,

305
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:51,358
I'll eat as much as
you want me to!

306
00:16:51,442 --> 00:16:53,358
Thank you. I
appreciate it.

307
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:55,900
I'll do it for Mina and Agni!

308
00:16:57,692 --> 00:16:59,067
Thanks to you,

309
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,108
every lost one of our rivals
has withdrawn their entry.

310
00:17:02,192 --> 00:17:03,900
The only ones left
are third-rate brands

311
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:05,733
I've never heard of before...

312
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:09,733
and some company that
makes children's toys.

313
00:17:09,817 --> 00:17:12,817
The Funtom Company...?
Does that mean...?

314
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,858
No need to worry... With that
'godly' right hand of yours,

315
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:18,108
we're sure to win
the Royal Warrant.

316
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:20,108
My prince...

317
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:24,483
Pardon me, sir.

318
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:28,108
For today's tea, we have
gâteau au chocolat.

319
00:17:28,192 --> 00:17:31,817
I'll need proper dress
for a royal audience.

320
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,775
You insist she won't come,
but you dress up anyway...

321
00:17:34,858 --> 00:17:36,192
How amusing.

322
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:38,858
The Queen's guard dog is
a well trained little pup, eh?

323
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:41,525
Have you concocted a curry
better than Agni's yet?

324
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:42,983
No.

325
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:45,692
According to Prince Soma,
something is still lacking.

326
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:47,233
Then get back
to the kitchen and

327
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,442
stop wasting your time
baking cakes...

328
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:51,358
You have more important
things to do.

329
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:52,775
Yes, I understand, my lord.

330
00:17:52,858 --> 00:17:54,025
And anyway,

331
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:55,942
I'm not in the mood for
chocolate right now...

332
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:57,983
Drop it into the curry
or something.

333
00:17:58,067 --> 00:18:00,567
Indeed... my young master.

334
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:10,483
Until that day, I wasn't
a religious man...

335
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,525
I was born into
the Brahmins...

336
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:15,817
We were the highest caste...
people meant to serve

337
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,483
the gods... But I saw
the greed and snobbery

338
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:20,025
of the men
around me...

339
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:22,067
and I couldn't bring myself
to believe in

340
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,775
our righteousness...

341
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:27,400
I committed many crimes...
until finally...

342
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,442
The man you were
is dead now...

343
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:35,858
You will be reborn with a
new name and a new life!

344
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,983
I finally found something
divine... It was in him.

345
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:44,150
Now... you are Agni.

346
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:47,442
I vowed to use this
hand only for the god

347
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:49,442
I found in him.

348
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:05,525
Is this outfit fit for a
royal audience, my lord?

349
00:19:05,608 --> 00:19:08,858
Yes, it's fine.
Now drop it... Anyway...

350
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:11,400
are you certain you can
beat Agni's curry today?

351
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,025
Of course.

352
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:15,608
I swear it on the
Phantomhive name.

353
00:19:15,692 --> 00:19:18,483
I shall win a Royal
Warrant without fail.

354
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,983
Well... I have certain
preparations to make.

355
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:31,692
I must excuse myself.

356
00:19:33,483 --> 00:19:36,525
You can do it,
Sebastian. Good luck!

357
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:43,233
Why are you here?

358
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,150
Mina!

359
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,692
Was that...? Prince Soma?

360
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:00,608
Mina...! I'm so glad...!
Agni got you back.

361
00:20:00,692 --> 00:20:02,275
You don't have
to worry now...

362
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:04,692
We can go back
to the palace!

363
00:20:04,775 --> 00:20:10,817
Highness?
How stupid are you?

364
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,067
Go back with you...?
Don't make me laugh...!

365
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,817
Why would I ever want
to go back there...?

366
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,900
I already went to so
much trouble to escape.

367
00:20:19,983 --> 00:20:22,650
People born into royalty
can lounge around,

368
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:24,942
never doing a day
of work in their lives...

369
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:26,900
But because I was born
into a lower caste,

370
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:29,067
I was forever doomed
to be a servant.

371
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,192
I don't want to spend
my whole life trapped

372
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:32,275
by the caste system!

373
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:34,233
You went with him willingly?...

374
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,733
It was your decision--

375
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:39,150
Yes that's right! A lowly
servant or a rich man's wife?

376
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:41,817
Even a child would know
which one is better!

377
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,525
I spent my life taking
care of you,

378
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:46,150
you selfish brat...!
I'm done with it.

379
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:49,317
I promised
I would not tell you...

380
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,317
but now, here you are.

381
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:54,817
You're old enough
to know the truth.

382
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,733
Mina and I came
to an agreement...

383
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:03,317
If I obeyed West...

384
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,483
she would reveal nothing of her
true feelings to the prince...

385
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:11,233
He can't know the truth...
He's still too young for that.

386
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:12,858
So that's what this is about.

387
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:17,483
Don't you see... This is for
my prince. I can not lose!

388
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,900
Funny you say that...
Neither can I.

389
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,900
I'll never win
with this swill...!

390
00:21:29,983 --> 00:21:34,733
Something is still missing...!
But what is it?

391
00:21:34,817 --> 00:21:36,650
You seem quite troubled.

392
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:40,442
Perhaps using this
would help you.

393
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:49,483
What the...?

394
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,817
Thank you all for waiting!

395
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,858
Welcome to the
Curry Festival...

396
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,775
and the best curry
London can offer!

397
00:22:02,775 --> 00:22:05,275
Great... this guy again.

398
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,358
Attention-seeker.

399
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:11,650
Prince Soma...

400
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:16,067
you can't stand to look at
my face anymore, can you...?

401
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,567
No...! I have to focus
on the competition!

402
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:22,233
And now,
let the cooking begin!

403
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,608
What is it?

404
00:22:24,692 --> 00:22:26,442
It sounds like...

405
00:22:33,942 --> 00:22:35,442
Her Majesty!

406
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,275
Spice is nice!

407
00:24:16,983 --> 00:24:20,983
I'm sorry about that...
I was talking to myself.

408
00:24:21,067 --> 00:24:23,400
A Phantomhive butler
who can't make curry

409
00:24:23,483 --> 00:24:25,442
isn't worth his cumin.

410
00:24:25,525 --> 00:24:27,650
Even the strongest
detractor will be hoping

411
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:31,025
to curry favor with me.

412
00:24:31,108 --> 00:24:35,400
Next time on Black Butler:
"His Butler, Competing."

413
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:37,817
You see... I am simply
one hell of a butler.
