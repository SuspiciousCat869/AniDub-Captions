1
00:00:18,817 --> 00:00:21,150
This is the second fire
we've had since

2
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:23,983
I began my service
with the Phantomhives...

3
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:27,358
All I can do, in the end,
is document the story

4
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:29,692
of this grand estate.

5
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:34,358
That is my role...
However... I suppose...

6
00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:37,442
That role...
is coming to an end.

7
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:56,400
That's a strong wind
a-blowing, eh?

8
00:00:56,483 --> 00:00:58,483
Aye, and it's warmer
than it ought to be.

9
00:00:58,567 --> 00:01:00,525
We'll see rough waters.

10
00:01:00,608 --> 00:01:02,733
I hope we'll make port
in London soon.

11
00:01:13,275 --> 00:01:15,942
I found you... Lord.

12
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:17,650
The Undertaker?

13
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,608
That tiny, whiny bloke
Will was the one who

14
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,650
brought me into
this expedition.

15
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:36,150
Apparently he'll be
shorthanded in London,

16
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:38,400
so he roped me into it
by promising to waive

17
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:41,275
my library fines.

18
00:01:41,358 --> 00:01:42,983
Will's coming to London?

19
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:46,233
Yes... There's much work to
do... We have a great many

20
00:01:46,317 --> 00:01:48,858
souls to collect
in London this evening.

21
00:01:49,858 --> 00:01:50,983
Look at that!

22
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:52,150
What is it?!

23
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:54,983
Ah... seems that it's begun.

24
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,817
My... They certainly put on
quite the show, don't they?

25
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,400
And now I must be on my way.

26
00:02:13,858 --> 00:02:18,525
Hold on! Tell me...
Why did you come here?

27
00:02:18,608 --> 00:02:21,108
You and I have our
share of history together,

28
00:02:21,192 --> 00:02:23,775
don't we? In light
of that fact...

29
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:26,317
I thought I would
give you fair warning.

30
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:32,692
My young Earl...
before much longer...

31
00:02:32,775 --> 00:02:34,358
...you'll die.

32
00:04:13,108 --> 00:04:14,900
I'll die... what do you mean?

33
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:16,942
No!

34
00:04:23,275 --> 00:04:25,067
You'll die.

35
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:30,525
Sebastian's gone...
He isn't with me anymore,

36
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:34,025
which means the death
waiting for me is...

37
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:36,817
it's useless... wrong.

38
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:46,483
The hatred... my pain...
They're burning out.

39
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:49,525
Everything is burning.

40
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:51,608
Burning away...

41
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:05,358
You're hurting... I well
understand. I'm quite sorry...

42
00:05:05,442 --> 00:05:09,275
but I'm simply not at liberty
not to finish you off right now.

43
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,775
So much to do.

44
00:05:19,858 --> 00:05:22,233
Ugh... that's revolting.

45
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,983
Majesty, the holy flame
has begun the salvation

46
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:29,900
of your land.

47
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,317
Ah... I see.

48
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,150
Isn't it wonderful?

49
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:37,733
We shall finally
be greeting the unpolluted

50
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:40,483
England of the new century!

51
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:42,567
Something's wrong, Majesty?

52
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,150
Ever since we returned
from Paris, you seem to be

53
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:46,650
in poor health.

54
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:51,150
Ashe, come
...see this. It hurts.

55
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,358
It hurts so much.

56
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:03,192
Forgive my touch.

57
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,983
His body is
beginning to rot.

58
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,608
Please allow me
to perform a cleansing.

59
00:06:15,692 --> 00:06:17,358
No!

60
00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:20,942
I can't lose him!
Leave me this at least...

61
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:23,608
Leave me his body...
just as it was.

62
00:06:23,692 --> 00:06:24,858
Majesty...

63
00:06:24,942 --> 00:06:27,192
He doesn't need to be
cleansed... He's perfect

64
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:31,025
just as he is. Please
do something Ashe!...

65
00:06:31,108 --> 00:06:32,108
Save him for me!

66
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,858
You smell.

67
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:39,983
You are... unclean.

68
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:51,692
Yes, she may be the queen, but
she's only human... and a

69
00:06:51,775 --> 00:06:56,150
foolish human at that... How
terribly sad for her Majesty.

70
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:58,650
The pain, and all the tears
that have fallen in

71
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:01,317
this corrupt land...
their genesis...

72
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,983
was when humans were divided
into male and female.

73
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:08,483
We can show great mercy...
but still...

74
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:10,900
The humans can't be saved.

75
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:15,275
No salvation.

76
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:19,442
My dear Albert
is falling down...

77
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:26,525
falling down, falling down.
Albert, my... dear...

78
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:32,525
is falling down my...
cherished... husband.

79
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:40,317
I'm going to die... soon.

80
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,275
Will it be on this ship,
or somewhere else?

81
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:51,858
What are you doing?!

82
00:07:51,942 --> 00:07:54,150
We can't go back to London
when it's in this shape

83
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:56,525
now can we?...
We'll have to do circles

84
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:57,108
around here.

85
00:07:57,192 --> 00:07:58,275
But why?!

86
00:07:58,358 --> 00:08:00,400
We're practically there now,
aren't we?!

87
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:05,650
Fine. I'll get on that one...
Get me a row boat!

88
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:08,442
For one little boy? Tell me
why should I even bother?...

89
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:10,608
Now, if there's money
changing hands...

90
00:08:10,692 --> 00:08:14,650
Ruddy fool!... I have
to return to London!

91
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:17,817
Do I really?... For what?

92
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:24,067
In the end... I didn't
kill Her Majesty...

93
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,608
No... I couldn't kill her.

94
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:30,067
If I let go of hatred...
then the person I've been

95
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,900
since that day
disappears with it.

96
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:35,233
That's not me!... Not me!

97
00:08:35,317 --> 00:08:36,650
But darling...

98
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:42,233
I will not let it go.
I will not lose... my hatred!

99
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:47,775
If I let go of my hatred...
then I don't exist.

100
00:08:47,858 --> 00:08:50,275
But... Then...

101
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:54,025
Who stands here now... who'm I?

102
00:08:54,108 --> 00:08:57,025
Wake up, kid...
I'm a busy man, you know...

103
00:08:57,108 --> 00:09:03,025
So maybe you should--
Bloody hell!...

104
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:05,150
What's wrong with you?
Are you mad?

105
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:08,817
Take this.

106
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,108
That's incredible!...
Just look at it shine!

107
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:14,567
It's a blue diamond.

108
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,567
You don't see
one of these every day.

109
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,025
Wait, what's a kid like you
doing with something like that?!

110
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:22,233
Take it... and give me a boat.

111
00:09:32,025 --> 00:09:33,900
Look, here he comes!

112
00:09:33,983 --> 00:09:36,275
Are you a Frenchman?

113
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:37,150
Come on!

114
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:38,608
Let go!... What're you doing?!

115
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:40,942
You bloody Frenchmen!...
You started this fire

116
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:42,400
in the first place,
didn't you!

117
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:47,067
You want to start a war
wif England, don't you?

118
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,192
Yes... It would appear that
your beloved Queen

119
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:51,025
is trying to plunge Europe,
not to mention

120
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:54,650
the rest of the world,
into full-scale war.

121
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:56,775
Just wait a moment...
I'm not--

122
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,358
Quickly men!
Another frog!

123
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:04,192
Stop it!... Please just stop!

124
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:11,025
What is this?...
What are they doing?

125
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:19,108
Such a fire!

126
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,483
Stop this!

127
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:26,483
I'll take that.

128
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:42,150
Where am I?...
Is this Hell?

129
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,983
He's here.

130
00:11:01,692 --> 00:11:04,067
So the boy has made his way
back to London.

131
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,983
Impressively done.

132
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,858
Tell me... what do you
think of the view?

133
00:11:21,317 --> 00:11:22,650
Look out!

134
00:11:27,858 --> 00:11:30,233
You must have
a death wish, yes sir!

135
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,733
M-... master!?

136
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:36,733
Mey Rin?!... But what
are you doing here?

137
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:40,150
Oh! Oh dear!... I'm so
very sorry, my lord...

138
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,858
I know it's my duty to
protect the estate, but...

139
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:44,358
But... I just... had to...

140
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:46,275
Calm down...
You're not in trouble.

141
00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:48,567
Just tell me
why you're here.

142
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,483
It's... it's Plu-Plu!

143
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:53,442
What about Pluto?

144
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:55,025
What are your thoughts?

145
00:11:57,275 --> 00:12:00,567
Next to the Great Fire
of London in 1666...

146
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,108
this one... well, it seems
to burn rather slowly.

147
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:07,442
Indeed, you're right...
This city is so unclean...

148
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:10,317
It takes time to burn filth...
It will be long

149
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,775
before London is
utterly purified.

150
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:16,400
Even so... good
shall prevail.

151
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:20,608
This fire will burn everything
out... And then at long last...

152
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:23,525
a cleaner land will
be able to emerge.

153
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:28,442
The door will be open...
to a new century.

154
00:12:29,525 --> 00:12:32,525
It seems that checkmate
is fast approaching.

155
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:36,650
What will you do with
your pawns... master?

156
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:07,275
The damn tranquilizers
don't work!

157
00:13:07,358 --> 00:13:08,525
Plu-Plu...

158
00:13:08,608 --> 00:13:10,775
So... you really think
we did the right thing,

159
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:13,983
chasing Pluto out here?...
The reason we were hired

160
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:16,858
in the first place was to
protect the estate, isn't it?

161
00:13:17,858 --> 00:13:19,358
Doesn't even look like we
can even do anything

162
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:20,650
to help here.

163
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:24,108
The house itself isn't what
I want to protect.

164
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:26,983
I want to protect the
relationships in it...

165
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:29,817
...all the good times
we had together!

166
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:34,608
For us to have that...,
everyone...

167
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:37,483
everyone has to live...
including Pluto!

168
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:43,275
Master!

169
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:47,567
What were you thinking,
bringing the master here?!

170
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,608
He said to! It's not
my place to say no.

171
00:13:51,692 --> 00:13:52,942
Pluto!

172
00:13:58,858 --> 00:14:01,525
An ironic world, isn't it?
You fought against me

173
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:02,858
for your master's sake...

174
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,775
And now here you are...
standing beside me...

175
00:14:05,858 --> 00:14:09,108
watching his
little tragedy play out.

176
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:13,358
I cannot act at the moment,
not without my master's order,

177
00:14:13,442 --> 00:14:16,067
and for now...
for awhile, at least...

178
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,400
I have no master to follow.

179
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:23,650
Through all of this,
I've thought to myself...

180
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:26,275
I might not mind joining
forces with you...

181
00:14:26,358 --> 00:14:29,483
We can rule the newly
reborn world.

182
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:33,858
The clean world...
When it springs from the fire.

183
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:35,233
How would that work?...

184
00:14:35,317 --> 00:14:37,650
I thought I was the epitome
of the uncleanliness

185
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:39,525
you so detest.

186
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:40,817
When you look
at them closely,

187
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,942
all things are two sides
of the same coin...

188
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:46,733
Morning and night...
man and woman...

189
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:48,692
light and darkness.

190
00:14:48,775 --> 00:14:51,108
But when they are put
through purifying flames,

191
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:53,233
they become one...

192
00:14:53,317 --> 00:14:55,400
They return to the
essential existence

193
00:14:55,483 --> 00:14:56,942
beloved of the Father.

194
00:14:57,025 --> 00:14:59,733
You want a doll...
another artificial thing

195
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:02,025
to satisfy
your hunger for power.

196
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:03,525
No.

197
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:08,067
Is there something
else you want?

198
00:15:11,108 --> 00:15:12,525
If you hunger...

199
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:15,150
I can come to you
as a woman, as well.

200
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:23,942
What are you up to here?

201
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:28,108
Well... it's just... we wanted
Pluto to be how he was...

202
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:29,233
We're sorry!

203
00:15:29,317 --> 00:15:31,192
And I'm already out
of tranquilizers.

204
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:33,317
Are you idiots?

205
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,442
You have real bullets,
don't you?

206
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,817
Master, are you telling us
that we should shoot him?

207
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,275
Take a look at his eyes.

208
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:45,608
His mind is
already long gone.

209
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:48,233
That up there isn't the
Pluto you and I knew...

210
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:50,108
It's just a beast.

211
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:52,692
A beast...

212
00:15:52,775 --> 00:15:55,067
You three know what
it's like, don't you?...

213
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,442
To have even your pride
stolen away from you...

214
00:15:57,525 --> 00:16:01,858
to be left behind, hollow...
It's a tragic way to live.

215
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,067
I order you... Mey Rin...
Finni... Bard...

216
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,150
Kill the demon hound...
any way you can.

217
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:19,858
Yes, sir.

218
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:38,692
He's everything I would
expect from someone

219
00:16:38,775 --> 00:16:41,067
who would employ
a demon such as you...

220
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,275
Unfeeling and ruthless, a soul
forever beyond redemption...

221
00:16:45,358 --> 00:16:48,233
As I said before,
you and I should join--

222
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:53,608
So that's it, then...

223
00:16:53,692 --> 00:16:57,233
No matter how much time
goes by Angels and demons

224
00:16:57,317 --> 00:17:00,358
will forever be on opposite
sides of the coin.

225
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:15,733
Let's go!

226
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:20,650
Now... all I can do is run.

227
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:22,942
If I'm going to die,

228
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:26,733
I will die with
the soul he craves...

229
00:17:26,817 --> 00:17:31,358
Only then... only then
can I regain my pride.

230
00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:42,442
I am the Earl of Phantomhive...
Ciel Phantomhive...

231
00:17:42,525 --> 00:17:44,067
I request to see--

232
00:18:02,192 --> 00:18:04,733
Time is standing still...

233
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:08,525
A trap?... No time
to decide that!

234
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:24,817
Her Majesty!

235
00:18:36,775 --> 00:18:39,192
What's this?!
What happened?

236
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:40,775
Who's that?

237
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:43,983
It's Her Majesty!

238
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:45,608
The Queen's been murdered!

239
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:46,650
Who did it?

240
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:48,358
Who's responsible?!

241
00:18:48,442 --> 00:18:50,400
Who is this murderer?!

242
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:58,400
I'm Ciel... I am the
Earl Phantomhive...

243
00:18:58,483 --> 00:19:00,108
as my father was!

244
00:19:00,192 --> 00:19:03,525
Phantomhive?... You mean to
say the queen's guard dog

245
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:04,567
has turned against her?!

246
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,192
I've cast off that title...
and no,

247
00:19:07,275 --> 00:19:09,525
I'm not the one
who killed Her Majesty.

248
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:12,233
You think to talk your way out?

249
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:16,525
No... I'm certain
I can't... but still...

250
00:19:16,608 --> 00:19:18,192
No matter what
you do to me, I will not

251
00:19:18,275 --> 00:19:19,608
be stopped now!

252
00:19:24,983 --> 00:19:27,025
I'm hit... bleeding...

253
00:19:27,108 --> 00:19:29,608
Think... the gates
of Heaven will forever be

254
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:31,608
out of your reach.

255
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:34,900
Do you wish to form
a contract with me?

256
00:19:34,983 --> 00:19:41,025
This is... my death...
This is... my soul...

257
00:19:45,858 --> 00:19:50,358
No... no... forget it!

258
00:19:58,067 --> 00:20:01,775
I... I won't end here...
Not like this!

259
00:20:03,192 --> 00:20:05,942
I see you've awoken,
young master.

260
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:12,025
Fire!

261
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:27,858
You came... back.

262
00:20:28,817 --> 00:20:32,233
It is exactly as
you said, Master.

263
00:20:32,317 --> 00:20:35,233
You won't end...
Not here. Not now.

264
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,692
Master... I ask your
forgiveness for taking

265
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:49,900
unauthorized leave.

266
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:51,983
What... was so important?

267
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:54,442
Oh... I was seeing
to the preparations

268
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:56,900
for the Last Supper.

269
00:20:56,983 --> 00:21:00,233
Spicy... bitter...
but sometimes sweet...

270
00:21:00,317 --> 00:21:04,442
It's a multifaceted meal,
indeed... Braised to perfection

271
00:21:07,525 --> 00:21:10,692
Thanks to you, this Last
Supper will be delicious...

272
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:13,733
I will be able to enjoy
the ultimate soul.

273
00:21:13,817 --> 00:21:16,650
I order you...

274
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:19,775
take me right now to this
angel of massacre!

275
00:21:19,858 --> 00:21:21,358
Yes sir.

276
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:31,817
He can't be a human!

277
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:37,150
Oh no... Indeed, I'm not.

278
00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:40,317
I'm simply...
one hell of a butler.

279
00:23:14,858 --> 00:23:16,150
Can they do it?

280
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:18,442
Assuming the servants fight
with all their might...

281
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:20,942
I believe they'll be an
even match for Pluto.

282
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,733
They should have a good
chance of winning.

283
00:23:22,817 --> 00:23:27,400
Well, whoever loses...
Before much longer...

284
00:23:27,483 --> 00:23:31,608
I'll see them... I'll be
seeing them again in Hell...

285
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:33,525
It's beginning.

286
00:23:53,108 --> 00:23:56,525
It's coming to me...

287
00:23:56,608 --> 00:23:58,858
The despair of the unclean
must ultimately be

288
00:23:58,942 --> 00:24:01,942
transformed into
divine hope!

289
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:06,692
And it feels... good.

290
00:24:10,608 --> 00:24:14,150
I've waited a long time
for this, my young master.

291
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:16,608
Combing your fine dainty locks,

292
00:24:16,692 --> 00:24:18,608
gingerly fastening
the buttons of your

293
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:21,817
shirt one by one...
it was all I could do

294
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,400
to keep the surge
of emotion in check.

295
00:24:24,483 --> 00:24:27,608
But now at last
the moment has come

296
00:24:27,692 --> 00:24:32,650
there is no need to hold
back. Bon appetite.

297
00:24:32,733 --> 00:24:36,025
Next time, on Black Butler:
"His Butler, Fluent."

298
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:38,858
You see, I am simply
one hell of a butler.
