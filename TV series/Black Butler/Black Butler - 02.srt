1
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:17,067
Bloody hell...
this wire's done for.

2
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,817
Oh, not the rats again!

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,192
This is getting ridiculous,

4
00:00:20,275 --> 00:00:22,108
I mean I heard they'd
been plaguing London lately,

5
00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:24,192
but I never expected
them to be such a problem

6
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:25,983
this far out of the city.

7
00:00:30,317 --> 00:00:32,525
Now I've got you...rat!

8
00:00:32,608 --> 00:00:33,858
Uh oh!

9
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,192
Looks like it got away...
Hee-hee!

10
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:40,775
What're you laughing for...?!

11
00:00:40,858 --> 00:00:43,567
Are you trying to kill us,
too, you idiot?!

12
00:02:20,983 --> 00:02:22,608
Look! There's another one!

13
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:23,900
Catch it!

14
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:29,525
Quite the commotion
going on out there...

15
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,817
It seems you're experiencing
a rat problem as well.

16
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:37,358
Speaking of which, how long
will you let the vermin

17
00:02:37,442 --> 00:02:39,483
run wild? Filthy monsters...

18
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:41,025
Someone really ought
to take care of them,

19
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:42,150
don't you think?

20
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:44,233
And 'someone' will...

21
00:02:44,317 --> 00:02:46,900
He's just waiting
for the opportune moment.

22
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:51,400
Indeed... He prefers
to settle things with one blow.

23
00:02:51,483 --> 00:02:54,567
Will you pass on this turn,
too, Lord Phantomhive?

24
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,025
I'll pass... It's my policy
not to shoot if I know

25
00:02:58,108 --> 00:02:59,150
that I'll miss.

26
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:00,317
That's all very well...

27
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,442
But when will you
handle the problem?

28
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:05,150
Anytime you like.
The rats will soon come looking

29
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:06,817
for their forbidden cheese...

30
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,650
And I hold the key
to the storehouse.

31
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:18,650
Even so... Locating the nest
and eliminating the vermin

32
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:21,442
promises to be a tedious task...

33
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:25,358
you should concentrate on
preparing me a suitable reward.

34
00:03:25,442 --> 00:03:26,942
You're a vulture.

35
00:03:27,025 --> 00:03:30,608
Sir Randall... I'd be careful
how you smear my family name.

36
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:33,150
Heh, you're
in trouble now, Randall...

37
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:35,608
What next, Lord Phantomhive?

38
00:03:35,692 --> 00:03:38,567
It's time to put an end to this
worthless game, don't you think?

39
00:03:42,192 --> 00:03:44,108
How soon can you
secure the payment?

40
00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:46,025
Tonight...
I'll have it by then.

41
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,525
Then I'll send
a carriage for you later.

42
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,650
We can even prepare some
light entertainment for you...

43
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:57,108
Does that sound good?

44
00:03:57,192 --> 00:03:58,900
You passed your turn twice,
and now you're after them

45
00:03:58,983 --> 00:04:00,358
all in one go??!

46
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:01,733
Naturally.

47
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:04,025
Careful, or your greed
will undo you.

48
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,192
Am I undone?

49
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:19,192
Your tea. We have a special
Darjeeling blend to offer

50
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:22,025
from Fortnum and Mason today.

51
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:25,733
Smells lovely... Tea can
be excellent when made well.

52
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:29,608
Grell.

53
00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:31,025
Yes, my lady?

54
00:04:31,108 --> 00:04:32,733
Learn something
from Sebastian.

55
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:35,567
Yes.

56
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,650
Just look at him...
I mean... this physique...!

57
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:40,192
You should quit
this country job

58
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:41,942
and come work for me
in the city!

59
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:44,150
Madam Red...

60
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:46,025
Oh, sorry...!
I couldn't help it...

61
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:48,525
He looked like
he needed a physical...

62
00:04:48,608 --> 00:04:50,108
Just a doctor's habit.

63
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,483
So, do you believe the
drug trafficker you're after

64
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:56,608
was one of your guests today?

65
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:57,817
Perhaps.

66
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,275
Why not leave
the extermination to Lau...?

67
00:05:00,358 --> 00:05:04,192
A rat knows best where
a rat's nest is, doesn't he?

68
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:07,483
I'm but a tame guinea pig
dedicated to my lord.

69
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:09,775
If the earl instructs me
not to act...

70
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:12,317
I'm bound to do nothing.

71
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,442
Watch it...! You'd best
keep your filthy paws off

72
00:05:14,525 --> 00:05:16,108
my darling nephew!

73
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:18,817
You wound me...! I would never
paw at him in his own home,

74
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,233
dear Madam!

75
00:05:20,317 --> 00:05:21,983
Are you saying you would
if you were elsewhere?! Careful!

76
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:23,775
You're on thin ice now, sir!

77
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:26,442
Master?

78
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:28,358
You'd better be! I hope you
understand how protective I am

79
00:05:28,442 --> 00:05:29,275
of my dear nephew!

80
00:05:29,358 --> 00:05:31,483
The rats are here.

81
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:33,108
It went that waaaay!

82
00:05:33,192 --> 00:05:34,650
And here, too.

83
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:42,025
Master? Today's dessert...

84
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,150
It's a deep dish pie prepared
with fresh apples and raisins.

85
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:46,692
It will be ready soon...

86
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:49,233
Would you like to eat
with your guests?

87
00:05:49,317 --> 00:05:51,942
Bring it to my study...
I'm done here.

88
00:05:53,192 --> 00:05:55,067
Certainly, my lord.

89
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:05,775
That's enough of that.

90
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:07,900
Now stop playing
and get to work.

91
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:09,108
Sir.

92
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:13,692
Finally, some peace and quiet.

93
00:06:20,275 --> 00:06:21,525
Young Master...?

94
00:06:21,608 --> 00:06:24,483
I've brought your pie
and afternoon tea.

95
00:06:30,442 --> 00:06:32,650
This is terrible.

96
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:35,483
The refreshments will
all be wasted now.

97
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:47,317
The policeman
of England's underworld.

98
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,650
One of the nobles who have done
the royal family's dirty work

99
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:52,608
for generations.

100
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:56,317
"The Queen's Guard Dog," tasked
with disposing of anyone

101
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,150
who disagrees with her.

102
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:02,025
Just how many nicknames
do you have...?

103
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:05,067
And how many families
have you crushed...

104
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,192
Ciel Phantomhive?

105
00:07:08,983 --> 00:07:11,108
I thought it would be you...

106
00:07:11,192 --> 00:07:13,983
You shame your family,
Azzurro Vanel

107
00:07:15,983 --> 00:07:18,983
Come now... my little
Lord Phantomhive...

108
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:22,567
Do you know how hard it is
for the Italian mafia here?

109
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,275
You Englishmen have nothing
but tea on the brain.

110
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:28,442
It's difficult to penetrate
those small minds of yours,

111
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:32,067
so we have to think
outside the box to make money...

112
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,817
So we found the drug trade.

113
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,025
The Pharmacy Act of 1868

114
00:07:36,108 --> 00:07:38,983
listed opium as
a restricted substance...

115
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:40,733
It is the Queen's decree...

116
00:07:40,817 --> 00:07:44,983
and I will eliminate those drugs
and the vermin who sell them.

117
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:48,317
Oh-You know, this is why
I hate all you Englishmen...

118
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,442
The queen this, the queen
that- The way you act,

119
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:52,400
you would think
she was your own mother.

120
00:07:52,483 --> 00:07:54,733
You line your pockets while
pretending the whole time

121
00:07:54,817 --> 00:07:57,900
you're better than the rest
of us... but in the end,

122
00:07:57,983 --> 00:08:00,775
we're no different
from each other...

123
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:02,858
Why can't we get along?

124
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:05,733
I've left orders about your key.
If I don't come back,

125
00:08:05,817 --> 00:08:08,733
my servants will make sure
the authorities get it...

126
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:13,317
I'm sorry... I have no
interest in 'getting along'

127
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,858
with someone like you.

128
00:08:14,942 --> 00:08:17,400
You brat
don't underestimate me!

129
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:20,108
My men are already waiting
at your estate...

130
00:08:20,192 --> 00:08:21,567
Where's the key?

131
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,358
Spit it out soon, or your
servants will start dying

132
00:08:24,442 --> 00:08:25,650
one by one.

133
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:30,650
Oh, I think
they'll be all right...

134
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:33,858
but you had better hope your
lap dogs know how to fetch.

135
00:08:40,817 --> 00:08:42,192
Did you hear that...?

136
00:08:42,275 --> 00:08:44,067
Time for talk is over!

137
00:08:49,692 --> 00:08:51,317
Oh dear...
This is most troubling.

138
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,358
Where could the master
have been taken?

139
00:08:54,775 --> 00:08:56,483
Sebastiaaaaaan!

140
00:08:57,733 --> 00:09:00,067
I just found a letter,
yes I did!

141
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,775
Addressed to whom?

142
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:05,900
Uh... to the servants...
of the Earl of Phantomhive.

143
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,608
Mey Rin, the letter please.

144
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:31,983
Letter...? Oh! Yes sir!

145
00:09:32,692 --> 00:09:34,942
If you want to return
your Master safely,

146
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:39,108
come to Nova Garden Bethnal
Green as soon as possible...

147
00:09:39,983 --> 00:09:42,817
Goodness, what a
dreadfully written letter.

148
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,067
Sebastian!

149
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,692
What is going on here?

150
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:49,900
Sorry for the noise, my lady...
I assure you, nothing's wrong.

151
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:51,525
Please don't concern yourself.

152
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:54,317
Nothing? Are you sure?

153
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,608
Everyone, I have
business to attend to.

154
00:09:56,692 --> 00:09:58,275
Would you mind
cleaning this up?

155
00:10:02,442 --> 00:10:04,442
So when you say 'clean', uh...

156
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:06,067
That means we can eat it...!

157
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,983
Right...? Sebastian?

158
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:14,525
Sorry, I missed.

159
00:10:14,608 --> 00:10:15,983
What do you mean you missed...?!

160
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,150
You are complete idiots!

161
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:20,358
I should have never
hired scum like you...

162
00:10:20,442 --> 00:10:21,858
Just get back here!

163
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,192
Um, sir... something's off...

164
00:10:27,275 --> 00:10:28,650
I see something...

165
00:10:30,858 --> 00:10:31,983
What's that?!

166
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:33,608
Aw, what's wrong...?

167
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:35,942
You little girls
see a bear in the woods?

168
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:39,150
What's happening-
did someone find you?

169
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:39,900
Talk to me.

170
00:10:39,983 --> 00:10:41,275
Hurry it up!

171
00:10:52,192 --> 00:10:54,275
It's coming... closer!

172
00:10:56,442 --> 00:10:58,942
That's it- I've had enough
of your games already!

173
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,775
No good...it's here!

174
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:12,608
Ah... Hello...? What happened?

175
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:16,983
That's too bad...

176
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:19,608
Sounds like your little
game of fetch is over.

177
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:25,067
Just shut-a your mouth,
you damn brat!

178
00:11:28,858 --> 00:11:30,150
You listen to me...!

179
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:31,483
If one you
don't answer right now,

180
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,358
I swear I'll kill you!

181
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,192
Hello.

182
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:35,650
Who's this?

183
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:39,650
Pardon me, but I represent
the Phantomhive estate...

184
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,817
I was wondering if my master
might be available.

185
00:11:45,442 --> 00:11:49,692
Hello...?
Is anyone there...? Hello?

186
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,108
Woof.

187
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,567
Very good, young master...

188
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,025
I will come to get you
momentarily.

189
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:10,400
Thank you for the use
of your field telephone.

190
00:12:12,692 --> 00:12:15,150
And now, there are a few things
I'd like to ask you about,

191
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:16,567
if that's alright.

192
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,525
First... I'd like to know
who you work for.

193
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:23,483
Hurry up, now... I'm not
exactly what you would call

194
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:24,983
a patient man.

195
00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:27,400
And you do remember what
happened to Humpty Dumpty,

196
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:29,192
don't you?

197
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:31,692
Ou-our employer's name
is Azzurro Vanel...

198
00:12:31,775 --> 00:12:33,483
He has a hideout
up in the city.

199
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:34,858
It's in the East End.

200
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:38,400
We just work for him!

201
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:40,358
But of course. I understand...

202
00:12:40,442 --> 00:12:44,108
I'm very sorry to have
interrupted your work gentlemen.

203
00:12:44,192 --> 00:12:47,275
I'll let you go now.
Have a safe trip.

204
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,150
Oh dear... Look at
how late it's gotten.

205
00:13:07,817 --> 00:13:09,608
If I don't move quickly,
we shall never have

206
00:13:09,692 --> 00:13:11,692
dinner ready in time.

207
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:26,400
Are we certain nothing's wrong?

208
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:28,025
If that butler says
everything's fine,

209
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:30,108
I'm inclined to believe him.

210
00:13:30,192 --> 00:13:32,358
He's been in the earl's
service for so long...

211
00:13:32,442 --> 00:13:33,942
and it's quite plain to see
there's some sort

212
00:13:34,025 --> 00:13:36,650
of unshakeable bond
between those two.

213
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,858
You can always find him at the
earl's side... Like a shadow.

214
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:45,692
'So long'? But Sebastian didn't
arrive until two years ago.

215
00:13:45,775 --> 00:13:47,233
That's not much time at all.

216
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:49,192
Oh, really...? How odd...

217
00:13:49,275 --> 00:13:51,358
My memory is so unreliable...

218
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:53,233
Isn't that right, Ranmao?

219
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:55,817
Useless.

220
00:13:57,233 --> 00:14:00,067
Listen up the Phantomhive boy
has help on the way.

221
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,692
Move it! Tighten security
at the gate...!

222
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,483
Not so much as
a single rat gets through.

223
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:13,733
My, my... what a splendid home.

224
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:15,733
'Ey! Who the hell's this guy?!

225
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:20,275
Ah, my apologies...you see...

226
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:23,483
I represent
the Phantomhive household.

227
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:26,525
Oh dear... We need
Sebastian here.

228
00:14:26,608 --> 00:14:28,400
Where did he go now?

229
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:29,942
I wish I knew!

230
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:33,067
I don't care where he is
right now or what he's doing.

231
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,108
This is all
I'm worried about...!

232
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:37,650
Does 'clean it up' mean
we can eat the pie or not...?!

233
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:39,733
I have to knoooow!

234
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:42,358
I'm sure just one bite each
would be okay.

235
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:45,067
No, Finny...!
You know how Sebastian is!

236
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,025
If we eat something
we're not supposed to,

237
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:49,400
he'll bake us into
his next pie!

238
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:52,275
You need to
calm yourself down, Bardroy...

239
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,150
A soothing drink might help...

240
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:55,775
Here, give this a try.

241
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:57,900
Milk...! Like
that's gonna help me!

242
00:14:57,983 --> 00:14:59,858
Milk is an important part
of your diet...!

243
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:02,858
It'll help you grow strong
bones, yes it will!

244
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,400
My arm...!
He shattered the bone!

245
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:13,483
Pardon me...but I'm in
a bit of a hurry. 5:34.

246
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,608
Move, damn it...!

247
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:43,275
Call in the boys
from the west tower...!

248
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:45,317
We need to rip
this bastard apart!

249
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,275
An entire swarm of rats...

250
00:15:47,358 --> 00:15:49,275
I'll get nowhere at this rate.

251
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:52,442
That's it...!
I'm going to eat it!

252
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:55,400
Mey Rin, tea...!
Finny, go get the silver!

253
00:15:55,483 --> 00:15:56,900
Sir, yes, sir!

254
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:01,108
It should be right in here...
What the--?

255
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:02,567
Is somethin' wrong?

256
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,025
I don't understand...
The silver's supposed

257
00:16:05,108 --> 00:16:09,400
to be here... But I don't
see a single knife or fork.

258
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:21,817
Who the hell is he?!

259
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:26,358
Now, now. If I couldn't
do this much, at least...

260
00:16:26,442 --> 00:16:28,942
Then what kind of
butler would I be?

261
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:48,358
Oh dear... That took
longer than I thought.

262
00:16:51,608 --> 00:16:53,317
Already 5:43.

263
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,942
I have come
to retrieve my master.

264
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:12,567
Is this a joke...?
I was expecting a giant

265
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,442
and instead I get
some scrawny dandy

266
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:17,483
in a tailcoat.
Who are you anyway...?

267
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,442
There's no way
that you're just a butler.

268
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:20,733
No sir...You see,

269
00:17:20,817 --> 00:17:25,358
I'm simply one hell
of a butler... I promise.

270
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:28,067
Yeah, sure...
It doesn't matter anyway.

271
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,275
I have no intention
of fighting you.

272
00:17:30,358 --> 00:17:31,525
Not yet...

273
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,900
But you better have
what I asked for.

274
00:17:38,983 --> 00:17:42,317
Yes I do... It's right here.

275
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:45,067
Wha--

276
00:17:57,858 --> 00:18:00,775
Aw, sorry, dandy...
I really am...

277
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:02,400
This round's mine.

278
00:18:02,483 --> 00:18:04,858
There's no way I was
going up against Phantomhive,

279
00:18:04,942 --> 00:18:08,358
lord of games, without
a trump card hidden.

280
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:10,108
I damaged the goods
a little bit,

281
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:11,692
but that's all right...

282
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:14,817
I'm sure you'll fetch a pretty
price even in this condition.

283
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,983
Don't worry.
You have so many enemies.

284
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:21,942
I doubt you'll be alive
all that much longer.

285
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:25,775
All right... I'm tired
of messing around.

286
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:29,150
How much longer are you
planning to play dead?

287
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,108
Not long.

288
00:18:31,192 --> 00:18:34,150
But how-...how are you-...?
You just...

289
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:42,483
Guns today are much more
efficient than they used to be.

290
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:45,358
They can shoot
so many bullets now.

291
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,483
Perhaps you'd like these back?

292
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:53,567
What are you doing?! Kill him!

293
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,567
Oh dear,...What
an awful thing to do

294
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,942
to a perfectly good tailcoat.

295
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:08,733
You could have
avoided that... Idiot.

296
00:19:08,817 --> 00:19:11,150
Master... How unfortunate.

297
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,775
They don't seem to have
taken good care of you.

298
00:19:14,858 --> 00:19:16,358
No...! Stay back!

299
00:19:16,442 --> 00:19:19,608
You look like a helpless little
child all bound up like that...

300
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,775
But then, I guess
that's appropriate.

301
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,858
I-If you come any closer,
I'll shoot him!

302
00:19:25,942 --> 00:19:27,858
Can we move this along...?

303
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:29,942
His breath smells awful.

304
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:32,483
But if I come any closer,
he might kill you.

305
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:35,358
Well then?... Are you saying
you want to break the contract?

306
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,900
No, of course not...
Nothing has changed.

307
00:19:37,983 --> 00:19:40,108
I remain your
faithful servant, lord.

308
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:42,733
What the hell kind of nonsense
are you two talking about?!

309
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:46,983
Master, you know what
you have to do...

310
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:48,817
now just say the words.

311
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:54,275
This is an order...!
Save me, now!

312
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:57,775
No! It's oveeeeer!

313
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:09,942
What the--
...But that's impossible!

314
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:11,942
Are you looking for this?

315
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:19,483
Here then... let me
give it back to you.

316
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:31,858
I must say, the game wasn't as
much fun this time, Sebastian.

317
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,858
No, wait, come back...!
Work for me!

318
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:39,858
Be my bodyguard and I'll pay
you ten times what he does...

319
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:42,108
All right then...
twenty times...!

320
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:44,733
And you can have all the liquor
and women you want too!

321
00:20:46,567 --> 00:20:50,108
I'm sorry Mr. Vanel...
It's an attractive offer,

322
00:20:50,192 --> 00:20:53,817
but I have no interest in such
materialistic things...

323
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:59,983
You see...I am simply...
one hell of a butler.

324
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:02,983
Uh... Right...ok...

325
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,525
As long as my master
holds the contract...

326
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:14,358
I am his loyal servant.

327
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,775
A wish. A sacrifice.
And this... All of these things

328
00:21:20,858 --> 00:21:24,275
keep me bound
to Lord Phantomhive.

329
00:21:24,358 --> 00:21:27,692
Until the day
I swallow his soul.

330
00:21:29,358 --> 00:21:30,983
Unfortunately for you...

331
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:33,025
...this game is over.

332
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:46,983
You're awake, master?

333
00:21:54,817 --> 00:21:57,692
Master! Welcome home, sir!

334
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,567
Oh-dear!

335
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,358
Master Ciel, you're injured!

336
00:22:01,442 --> 00:22:05,275
I just tripped and fell...
It's nothing to worry about...

337
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:08,358
What...? You don't believe
what your master tells you?

338
00:22:08,442 --> 00:22:10,400
Oh, no...we do!

339
00:22:10,483 --> 00:22:14,733
It's just, you look so cute,
being held like a baby and all!

340
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:16,442
Put... me... down!

341
00:22:18,067 --> 00:22:19,775
Stop looking at me like that...!

342
00:22:19,858 --> 00:22:20,775
Honestly...

343
00:22:20,858 --> 00:22:25,108
Master...
I'm so terribly sorry.

344
00:22:25,192 --> 00:22:27,442
I've committed
a blunder unacceptable for

345
00:22:27,525 --> 00:22:29,067
a Phantomhive Butler...

346
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,567
How can I ever atone?

347
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:36,317
I hang my head in shame...
dinner is not ready.

348
00:24:11,192 --> 00:24:12,900
At the suggestion
of Lady Elizabeth,

349
00:24:12,983 --> 00:24:16,483
Master Ciel's betrothed,
we will be holding a ball...

350
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:18,358
Unfortunately, my young master

351
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:20,108
cannot dance
to save his life...

352
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,358
His attempts are so
pathetic that calling in

353
00:24:22,442 --> 00:24:24,858
a dancing master
would be too embarrassing.

354
00:24:26,442 --> 00:24:28,608
It seems as if I shall
have to rid my lord

355
00:24:28,692 --> 00:24:30,692
of his two left feet myself.

356
00:24:30,775 --> 00:24:32,608
Next time on Black Butler...

357
00:24:32,692 --> 00:24:34,567
"His Butler, Omnipotent."

358
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,400
You see, I am simply
one hell of a butler.
