1
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:17,483
Master... prepare yourself.

2
00:00:35,483 --> 00:00:37,525
Where is it we're going?

3
00:00:37,608 --> 00:00:39,275
There are several
bridges referred to as

4
00:00:39,358 --> 00:00:42,025
"Devil's Bridge," because
supposedly they were made

5
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:47,650
by demons... And then...
there is the Tower Bridge...

6
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:49,942
which in all likelihood
the angel instructed

7
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:51,775
her majesty to build.

8
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:05,192
Human sacrifices?
How can anybody

9
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:08,025
considered this
to be a holy bridge?!

10
00:01:08,108 --> 00:01:10,442
One can go too far...
at which point

11
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:12,650
good becomes worse
than evil.

12
00:01:13,775 --> 00:01:16,775
Master... could you please
wait here for me?

13
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:18,442
I'm coming with you!

14
00:01:19,192 --> 00:01:22,358
If I may be clear...
You'd hold me back.

15
00:01:22,442 --> 00:01:25,483
I see... So, you're saying
you can't handle him

16
00:01:25,567 --> 00:01:27,650
if you're fettered down?

17
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:30,150
If you would so prefer...
you shall have the best view

18
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:32,150
in the house,
My young Lord.

19
00:01:41,817 --> 00:01:46,358
It's burning... The Queen's
dream... the humans.

20
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:53,108
At last, the great and notable
day of our Father cometh!

21
00:01:53,192 --> 00:01:54,608
We have our signs...

22
00:01:54,692 --> 00:01:58,025
There is blood and
fire and smoke.

23
00:01:58,108 --> 00:02:01,483
You can see it too...
I know you can.

24
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:05,858
Why did you kill
the queen?

25
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:07,692
Her eyes became clouded.

26
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:09,233
Her eyes?

27
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:11,983
They should have been firmly
fixed on the future...

28
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:13,775
but held captive by the past,

29
00:02:13,858 --> 00:02:15,483
they dulled and rotted.

30
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:19,025
So I had no other choice...
I had to purify her.

31
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:22,483
The seat may be
uncomfortable but I believe

32
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:24,733
it will offer you
the best vantage.

33
00:02:24,817 --> 00:02:26,108
Indeed.

34
00:02:26,192 --> 00:02:28,608
Master... your orders now?

35
00:02:32,358 --> 00:02:35,858
My orders are...
kill the angel now!

36
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,483
As you wish my young lord.

37
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:44,317
This great bridge
will soon be completed...

38
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,692
and then eastern London
will be safe from impurity.

39
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:51,150
I am an angel
with a solemn duty...

40
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:55,275
No demon may ever be allowed
to enter through this gate...

41
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:58,608
I'll deal with you...
I shall purge you.

42
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:02,192
You will be pure...
pure as the driven snow.

43
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:18,442
Sebastian!

44
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:27,942
Ugh! So much work to do!

45
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:32,150
Eh? Wasted effort is one
of the privileges of youth,

46
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:33,150
isn't it?

47
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:35,400
What do mean, 'wasted'?!

48
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:37,192
You see all the
black matter?...

49
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:39,692
It's made up of the joy
and agony that belonged

50
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:44,525
to the dead... You see... it's
what humans call 'the heart'.

51
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:47,358
These hearts have been
extracted from their souls...

52
00:03:47,442 --> 00:03:49,983
They can hardly be
called souls now.

53
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:52,275
I doubt very much
that they can be stored

54
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:54,650
in the Reaper's
library anymore,.

55
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:57,775
But why?... Why should
a heart matter?

56
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:01,900
I don't understand!
The record's blank!

57
00:04:08,192 --> 00:04:09,983
What is this?

58
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:16,233
It's so lovely. It feels...

59
00:04:16,317 --> 00:04:18,192
Oh, yes, it feels good...

60
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:21,608
Nicer than anything
a human has touched before.

61
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:26,942
An angel who revels
in impurity... You've fallen.

62
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:32,150
Impurity is not something I am
personally able to enjoy, but...

63
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:36,608
Nevertheless, the despair
it brings endows me

64
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:39,192
with a certain amount
of power.

65
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:56,192
I am growing stronger
by the moment...

66
00:04:56,275 --> 00:05:00,692
But, what should I do next...
What do you think?

67
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:01,942
I still have--

68
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:03,233
--so many options.

69
00:05:03,317 --> 00:05:05,483
I haven't given up
on you, you know.

70
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:07,692
Sorry, but you
aren't my type...

71
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:10,358
You're much too enamored
by that dog.

72
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:15,442
If you refuse to accept me in
the lunar form of a woman...

73
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:19,775
Then I will assume a man's
form and be the sun.

74
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:25,900
Do you see my light?
It will penetrate you.

75
00:05:25,983 --> 00:05:29,608
It will pierce even the
darkest depths of your heart.

76
00:05:29,692 --> 00:05:31,775
You have no tact, do you?

77
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:39,983
The Final Judgment
is now approaching.

78
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:41,483
Hear me, demon...

79
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:44,442
Your chest shall be the
sheath for my sword.

80
00:05:47,317 --> 00:05:49,233
I will jam it in to the hilt!

81
00:05:53,442 --> 00:05:54,692
Sebastian!

82
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:58,692
So, someone's
plundering souls?

83
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,858
Will!

84
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,775
While the taking of souls
is necessary...

85
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:05,358
it is the province of reapers.
On just this one occasion,

86
00:06:05,442 --> 00:06:08,108
I am willing to take on
unpaid overtime...

87
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:11,817
Here, Grell Sutcliff.

88
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,858
Woo-hoo! Tonight'll be deadly!

89
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:20,067
You are all expected to take
out a goodly number.

90
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,900
The after-party will be
a business expense.

91
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:29,025
It's true I have given
you pain...

92
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:32,108
but I suggest you consider it
a blessing, demon.

93
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,192
For pain is indeed pleasure...

94
00:06:34,275 --> 00:06:36,567
and you cannot hope to
truly experience one

95
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,108
without experiencing the other.

96
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:40,608
Oh, is that so?

97
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,442
Sebastian!

98
00:06:51,858 --> 00:06:54,317
Oh... master.

99
00:06:56,608 --> 00:06:59,983
Well... the enemy's
only lost his queen...

100
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:02,525
The game isn't over yet...

101
00:07:02,608 --> 00:07:06,858
No... Not until I hear
the final call.

102
00:07:06,942 --> 00:07:10,317
You allow yourself to be
distracted during our fight?!...

103
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,192
Who do you think you are?

104
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,525
Blasted reapers!...

105
00:07:42,608 --> 00:07:44,525
How dare they presume
to interfere with

106
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:47,067
our sacred ceremony?

107
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,442
Yes, what a pity...

108
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:50,192
I suppose we're
all going to miss out

109
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:52,442
on that 'purity' of yours.

110
00:07:52,525 --> 00:07:56,775
So now then... shall we
continue our fight?

111
00:07:56,858 --> 00:08:01,525
I had hoped to spend longer
with you... So much for that.

112
00:08:18,983 --> 00:08:21,442
Where is that cursed
demon hound!

113
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:24,025
You did it... Well done.

114
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:28,525
It's Useless...

115
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:32,650
Everyone is useless...
useless, useless!...

116
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:37,108
I must purify them all!...
I must purify!

117
00:08:37,192 --> 00:08:37,900
Master!

118
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:41,608
Taste the flames of hell!

119
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:56,525
Sebastian, what happened?

120
00:08:58,983 --> 00:09:03,067
Young master... If I may,
I'd ask a favor.

121
00:09:05,317 --> 00:09:07,192
Please close your eyes.

122
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:08,858
Uh, but why?

123
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:12,275
I am your butler... It is
not acceptable to damage

124
00:09:12,358 --> 00:09:14,692
my master's
impression of me.

125
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:20,942
Until I give the word...
Please... close them.

126
00:09:22,983 --> 00:09:24,442
Yes, I'll do it.

127
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:37,400
Now then... at last
you'll see my true form...

128
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:48,275
It's unsightly,..
disgusting... repulsive...

129
00:09:49,942 --> 00:09:52,275
But it is my true form.

130
00:09:58,483 --> 00:10:00,192
A demon!

131
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:27,192
Master!... Can you
last long enough

132
00:10:27,275 --> 00:10:29,525
for me to count down to ten?

133
00:10:29,608 --> 00:10:31,525
Yes!

134
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,233
Then here we go.

135
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:36,400
Ten!

136
00:10:36,483 --> 00:10:36,900
Nine!

137
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:38,525
Revolting!

138
00:10:38,608 --> 00:10:39,858
Eight!

139
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:41,525
Unclean!... Bad!

140
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:42,525
Seven!

141
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,525
Useless! Evil!

142
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:45,525
Six!

143
00:10:45,608 --> 00:10:47,733
Filthy! Defiled!

144
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:50,733
Five!

145
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,733
Four!

146
00:10:53,817 --> 00:10:54,983
Three!

147
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:57,733
Filthy, filthy, filthy,
filthy, filthy, filthy!

148
00:10:57,817 --> 00:10:59,275
Two.

149
00:11:03,483 --> 00:11:04,567
One.

150
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,650
It's over now... master.

151
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:24,150
My lord... you lied.

152
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:26,900
You promised you'd
live 'til I counted down.

153
00:12:29,608 --> 00:12:33,358
Well, sometimes... I lie.

154
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:36,525
I won't let you die yet.

155
00:12:36,608 --> 00:12:42,650
Right... and you don't
ever lie... Sebastian...

156
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:45,733
I want to ask
you something.

157
00:12:45,817 --> 00:12:47,525
Yes, my lord?

158
00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:50,358
Who precisely are you now?

159
00:12:50,442 --> 00:12:53,525
Don't you know?...
Before my master...

160
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:57,567
no matter the occasion...
I'm one hell of a butler.

161
00:13:02,817 --> 00:13:05,067
My My

162
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,567
The angel has
completed it.

163
00:13:08,942 --> 00:13:12,525
Now the bridge
is truly... holy.

164
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:34,775
Hey, bring that here!

165
00:13:34,858 --> 00:13:38,108
Everyone form a queue!
There's still water left!

166
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:41,650
Here... everyone gets two.

167
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:42,900
What is this?

168
00:13:42,983 --> 00:13:44,608
That's curry buns...

169
00:13:44,692 --> 00:13:47,442
Convenient, because
you can eat while walking...

170
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:49,942
and it's quite good
for the soul.

171
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:52,733
Eat it all... you'll
feel better in no time!

172
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:54,942
Thanks, mister!

173
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:01,233
Perhaps, we must
believe that this trial

174
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:05,317
was God's way of testing
the spirits of our people.

175
00:14:06,817 --> 00:14:09,233
We stood firm
in the face of this...

176
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:12,108
and our sorrows
will not last forever...

177
00:14:12,192 --> 00:14:14,942
We greet a new century
and with it a new

178
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:18,567
British Empire... destined
to be greater than ever.

179
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:25,692
A false queen
exhorting the ashes of

180
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:27,317
our great city.

181
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,817
I'm sorry, sir?

182
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,483
If enough people believe,
there is no difference

183
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:34,483
between that which
is fake and real.

184
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:37,858
I guess some people
don't understand that.

185
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:40,108
Let's go.

186
00:14:40,192 --> 00:14:41,275
Right!

187
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,567
My lady!

188
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,900
Paula.

189
00:14:48,983 --> 00:14:51,525
They say that the fires in
London have gone out...

190
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:54,400
Which means we can go back
home now Lady.

191
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:56,400
Is there any word
on the man I sent

192
00:14:56,483 --> 00:14:58,608
to check on Ciel?

193
00:14:58,692 --> 00:15:02,400
I'm so sorry my lady...
There's nothing.

194
00:15:02,483 --> 00:15:04,192
Oh.

195
00:15:05,317 --> 00:15:07,442
Well, these flowers
are beautiful!

196
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:12,567
Yes... I came here because
their lovely blue color

197
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,275
reminded me of Ciel's ring...

198
00:15:15,358 --> 00:15:16,775
The Earl's ring?

199
00:15:18,983 --> 00:15:20,233
If you'll allow me, miss,

200
00:15:20,317 --> 00:15:22,275
may I please have one
of your flowers?

201
00:15:24,608 --> 00:15:25,775
Here!

202
00:15:33,817 --> 00:15:35,608
We can just make
another one...

203
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:36,858
How does
that sound?

204
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:38,025
Can we?

205
00:15:38,108 --> 00:15:40,275
Of course Lady we
can make many more...

206
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:41,942
Look around!
We are surrounded by

207
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:45,025
so many beautiful flowers!

208
00:15:45,108 --> 00:15:48,733
We can make
as many rings as we need.

209
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:50,733
So many...

210
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:12,525
Master... I see
you have awoken.

211
00:16:14,025 --> 00:16:16,733
Where is this?
Where are we?

212
00:16:16,817 --> 00:16:18,358
You wish to know?

213
00:16:18,442 --> 00:16:20,942
Why else did I ask?

214
00:16:21,025 --> 00:16:27,400
No... now that I think
about it... Maybe not.

215
00:16:29,317 --> 00:16:33,275
I feel as if I've been
asleep for such a long time.

216
00:16:35,192 --> 00:16:37,150
What's this?

217
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:42,900
Your Cinematic Record...
Apparently, it came to meet you.

218
00:16:42,983 --> 00:16:49,525
I see... This is my life...
This is how I lived.

219
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:54,483
But... I'm dead now.

220
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:59,817
No Not yet... Though death
will come to claim you

221
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,608
soon enough, young master...

222
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:05,442
But I shall be here
until the end...

223
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,525
It is my duty as your butler.

224
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:14,192
I know Elizabeth...
She'll be quite unhappy.

225
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:19,400
Yes... Lady Elizabeth's love
for you runs very deep.

226
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:22,567
Oh, yes. She was
a sobbing mess when

227
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,733
Madam Red died, too!

228
00:17:24,817 --> 00:17:27,650
Indeed she cried
your tears and hers

229
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:29,525
You didn't
have enough.

230
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:34,150
And the servants?...
Are they dead?

231
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:39,358
Well, they were breathing
the last time I saw them.

232
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:43,942
I must admit... they are
uncommonly stubborn.

233
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:46,317
And Pluto?

234
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,358
I can collect his bones later.

235
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:50,942
His bones?

236
00:17:52,608 --> 00:17:57,067
No.. .What real meaning
do bones have?...

237
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,108
Everything...

238
00:17:59,192 --> 00:18:01,317
Everything...?

239
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,108
No...Never mind. "Everything"
isn't important.

240
00:18:06,192 --> 00:18:08,942
It's still too soon to matter.

241
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:13,650
What are all these light?

242
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:15,608
The thoughts of the
many people who have

243
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:18,233
passed through your life...
the warm regard that

244
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:20,483
they held you in.

245
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:23,608
Other people's
feelings... well...

246
00:18:25,608 --> 00:18:27,358
They're nice.

247
00:18:27,442 --> 00:18:28,733
Nice?

248
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:30,317
Yes...

249
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,942
I can leave them without
loneliness or sadness...

250
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:39,442
but... it's still...
well... it's still nice.

251
00:18:42,108 --> 00:18:43,525
What is this?

252
00:18:43,608 --> 00:18:46,525
Oh, it's just a little something
that I brought along...

253
00:18:46,608 --> 00:18:50,525
to keep you occupied...
A diary Tanaka left behind

254
00:18:50,608 --> 00:18:52,858
before departing.

255
00:18:52,942 --> 00:18:55,067
It's from Tanaka?

256
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:58,275
There is a truth
that I cannot tell you,

257
00:18:58,358 --> 00:18:59,733
young master.

258
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,900
It can't be!

259
00:19:03,983 --> 00:19:07,733
Her Majesty will obliterate
the Earl Phantomhive...

260
00:19:07,817 --> 00:19:09,775
In other words: me.

261
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,733
I don't understand...

262
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,650
Yet I can bear
no grudge against her...

263
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:18,233
These are such troubled times.

264
00:19:18,317 --> 00:19:22,525
But still... I'd appreciate it
if you'd keep it from Ciel...

265
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:25,233
It is possible that
I will be killed...

266
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:28,150
He should still remain loyal.

267
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,442
But My Lord...!

268
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:33,817
What have you ever known
hatred to accomplish?

269
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:40,317
So that angel actually
did know something,

270
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,858
after all...

271
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:45,067
She really wasn't just
making it all up.

272
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,858
What now... master?

273
00:19:47,942 --> 00:19:52,817
There's nothing to do....
My targets are all gone...

274
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,108
besides which...

275
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:59,692
Just take a look at me...
I'm gone.

276
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:05,400
It's a ring?

277
00:20:05,483 --> 00:20:09,483
How very familiar it looks...
Please allow me.

278
00:20:15,817 --> 00:20:18,025
That must be difficult for you.

279
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:24,900
I wanted nothing more than
to be a supurb butler...

280
00:20:24,983 --> 00:20:26,525
but I failed.

281
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:31,317
This flower does not
defines us.

282
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,608
I think it suits us... master.

283
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,900
This is me...
Ciel Phantomhive.

284
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:44,358
Yes... I am nothing more
than I can ever have been.

285
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:14,067
We're here... master.

286
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,150
So this is where it ends?

287
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:18,608
Yes.

288
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:20,400
What about that bird?

289
00:21:20,483 --> 00:21:22,150
I will see to it.

290
00:21:22,858 --> 00:21:26,858
Maybe you can give it
what's left of my soul.

291
00:21:26,942 --> 00:21:30,358
As kind as ever... Master.

292
00:21:30,442 --> 00:21:32,317
So, will it hurt?

293
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,400
It will, a bit... I am sorry...

294
00:21:35,483 --> 00:21:37,775
I will endeavor to be
gentle though.

295
00:21:37,858 --> 00:21:42,358
No... be as brutal
as you want.

296
00:21:42,442 --> 00:21:45,233
Etch the pain into me...

297
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:48,400
It's proof I had a life
worth living.

298
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,108
Indeed... My young lord.

299
00:22:37,358 --> 00:22:40,233
And now... Master...
