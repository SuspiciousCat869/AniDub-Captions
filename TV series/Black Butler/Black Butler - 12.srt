1
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,942
Ciel...

2
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:30,483
He disappeared
for a while after

3
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:33,317
the estate burned down
and his parents died.

4
00:00:48,692 --> 00:00:52,358
Eventually,
he did return home.

5
00:00:55,483 --> 00:01:00,150
But by then he had
stopped smiling.

6
00:01:01,442 --> 00:01:07,733
I love him... My Ciel.
And I love his smile.

7
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,942
But... For some reason...
We keep going in circles.

8
00:01:16,983 --> 00:01:21,567
What can I do?
How can I help him?

9
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,150
How do I get
his smile back?

10
00:01:27,275 --> 00:01:29,567
Ciel.

11
00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:10,275
You lost your parents....
Your home...

12
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:14,275
And this time... you stand
to lose Lady Elizabeth?

13
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,275
Sebastian!

14
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,900
Take that back...
right now!

15
00:03:21,983 --> 00:03:22,983
What do you mean?

16
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:24,733
I don't like you taunting me!

17
00:03:24,817 --> 00:03:27,775
Master... earlier you informed
me you had some business

18
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:30,025
to take care of.

19
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:34,817
This business of yours, did it
include endangering yourself

20
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,900
in a misguided effort to
rewrite the past, I mean?

21
00:03:40,525 --> 00:03:42,692
Do you remember what you said
at the Frost Fair...?

22
00:03:42,775 --> 00:03:45,775
About your body...
about your ring.

23
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:49,817
What you said... was both had
been shattered and reborn...

24
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,400
And that you no longer had any
fear of being broken yourself.

25
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:57,442
I remember... You don't
need to remind me.

26
00:03:59,025 --> 00:04:07,358
Build it up with iron and steel,
iron and steel, iron and steel.

27
00:04:07,442 --> 00:04:09,067
Build it up with
iron and steel--

28
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,650
This means
they defeated Grell?

29
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:14,150
Interesting... They appear
to be controlled

30
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:17,692
through the singing of that
song. In which case...

31
00:04:18,942 --> 00:04:23,442
Iron and steel
will bend and bow...

32
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:25,900
Bend and bow,
bend and bow.

33
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:33,400
Iron and steel will bend
and bow, my fair lady.

34
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:39,567
Iron and steel will bend and
bow, bend and bow, bend and bow.

35
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:45,192
Iron and steel will bend
and bow, my fair lady.

36
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:48,483
Who are you calling a lady?!

37
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:52,233
Now my young master...
Let us go.

38
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:56,400
I think not.
Ciel Phantomhive...

39
00:04:56,483 --> 00:04:58,900
You are now the
property of my master.

40
00:04:58,983 --> 00:05:00,942
Property...?!
Who do you think you--

41
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:03,817
The proof is there... You
are marked by the very ring

42
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,025
you're wearing.
I know what it is.

43
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:09,067
That is a Hope Piece...

44
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,025
The same gem my master
sends as a token to those

45
00:05:12,108 --> 00:05:14,942
who are destined
to become his dolls.

46
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,442
What master?

47
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,858
It's been decided.
Ciel Phantomhive is going to

48
00:05:19,942 --> 00:05:23,942
become a doll. An exquisite
doll made up of silver and gold.

49
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:31,983
Silver and gold will be stolen
away, stolen away, stolen away.

50
00:05:43,525 --> 00:05:46,025
He was indeed stolen away.

51
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:51,067
However, I am
thinking to myself,

52
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,442
Ciel Phantomhive will return,
Whether he wants to or not.

53
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:05,192
There we are... You're safe.

54
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:15,067
What about Lizzie...?!
She's still in there!

55
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,525
Did I order you to solve the
recent string of kidnappings,

56
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:18,858
or didn't I?

57
00:06:18,942 --> 00:06:21,108
Lizzie is one of
the kidnap victims...!

58
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:22,525
Saving her is the first pri--

59
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:26,358
If an order negates the
contract... I cannot obey it.

60
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:29,400
Your first priority is always
orders from the queen...

61
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:33,067
Similarly... my first
priority is your life.

62
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:39,275
I've devoted myself to your
service and protection...

63
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,483
It's been more than
two years now.

64
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,608
I can't very well let
someone steal you away

65
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:48,733
after all this time,
now can I?

66
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,233
Master?

67
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:56,025
Apparently the
Hope Piece is what marks

68
00:06:56,108 --> 00:07:01,358
the 'master's' next target...
And I have two of them...

69
00:07:01,442 --> 00:07:03,400
I guess that means I've
been doubly marked...

70
00:07:03,483 --> 00:07:05,858
Protecting me will
be a difficult task.

71
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:09,442
I'm not afraid
of hard work.

72
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,067
Pluto?

73
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,317
I searched the mansion,
top to bottom...

74
00:07:18,108 --> 00:07:20,692
I wasn't able find any sign
of Lady Elizabeth.

75
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:26,400
That leaves one place. She must
be in that sealed up tower.

76
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:38,400
Hey, now, calm down...!
What's wrong with you, puppy?

77
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:42,233
That's a surprise.
You're still alive?

78
00:07:49,275 --> 00:07:55,775
Wait a second...
A demon hound...? Really?

79
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:58,275
You're just now noticing?

80
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:05,817
Ooh la la! A night with
a demon hound! How sexy!

81
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,983
You really have no standards.

82
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:11,400
Now... I've been
waiting for you, Pluto.

83
00:08:14,275 --> 00:08:17,358
That door has been sealed
with unnatural power...

84
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:20,067
Only a demon hound
can open it.

85
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:27,608
Look, his collar's shining.

86
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:29,108
And so's the door.

87
00:08:41,358 --> 00:08:43,692
He's so big!

88
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:51,317
He's run off again.

89
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,483
No need to worry.

90
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,067
We'll follow him in...

91
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,150
He should prove to be
a serviceable guide.

92
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:46,275
Lizzie!

93
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:55,483
Lizzie?... Lizzie!

94
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,067
Oh my, it looks like
we're too late.

95
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:06,525
Wake up. Lizzie...!
Lizzie, wake up! Lizzie!

96
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:13,567
Where?

97
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,858
Lizzie... You're okay.

98
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:19,650
That's the ring.

99
00:10:23,317 --> 00:10:27,400
So you did like it...?
That makes me happy...

100
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:30,775
So happy.

101
00:10:36,108 --> 00:10:39,567
That was her gift for you...
The one you didn't open.

102
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,900
How foolish...
She didn't have to.

103
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,775
Then why did she?

104
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:52,817
Why is her body
moving without her control?

105
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:57,275
And why...

106
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:02,775
Is she going to hurt the
one person she loves

107
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:04,692
most in the world?

108
00:11:04,775 --> 00:11:06,358
What's happening to her?!

109
00:11:08,608 --> 00:11:11,942
No!

110
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:17,692
No...! No...!
No, no, no!

111
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:19,525
Look sharp, Grell.

112
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:21,275
Can't you see
what's happening?

113
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:23,067
I suppose so...

114
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,942
But I would hate to chip
one of my blades, so...

115
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:29,525
Please do help us out, Grell.

116
00:11:29,608 --> 00:11:32,317
Oh, Bassy...!
How could I deny you...?

117
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,025
Well then... when we kiss...
can there be...

118
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:37,233
just... a little bit...
of tongue?!

119
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:39,942
I have no idea what
you're talking about...

120
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:42,275
but I can in fact tie
a cherry stem in a knot

121
00:11:42,358 --> 00:11:43,983
using my tongue.

122
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:46,317
Oh, myyyyyyyy!

123
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:51,108
I cannot allow
a little girl like you

124
00:11:51,192 --> 00:11:54,358
to wield a better blade
than I do. Unforgivable.

125
00:11:54,442 --> 00:11:55,983
No, Grell...! Stop!

126
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:03,108
Is she alright?
What happened?

127
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,150
A puppet string.

128
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,608
Only a death scythe could
have cut it with such ease...

129
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,692
Well, Sebastian...?
Aren't I amazing...?

130
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:20,317
Tell me how good I am!

131
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,692
Well done...

132
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,025
Perhaps you should run
with scissors more often.

133
00:12:23,108 --> 00:12:26,317
Oh...! I am just
flattered to death!

134
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,275
Now let's see...
where does the string lead to?

135
00:12:31,692 --> 00:12:34,525
So then, I began
thinking to myself...

136
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:40,942
"I have two new dolls
at my disposal.

137
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:43,150
What materials
shall I use this time?"

138
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:47,358
Indeed...? And of what
materials are you made?

139
00:12:47,442 --> 00:12:53,817
Me...? Huh... I don't know...
What am I made out of?

140
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,150
Well... I'm not sure... but
whatever materials were used

141
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:00,400
don't seem to be of
the highest quality.

142
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:03,358
Oh my. So then
I thought to myself...

143
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:05,983
"I have always believed
that I was human...

144
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:09,817
but... lately...
I often find termites

145
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,567
crawling out of my ears.
Isn't that strange."

146
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,025
Now, Grell.

147
00:13:26,108 --> 00:13:28,442
Oh, Bassy...!
We'll work together as one!

148
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:30,525
United by love!

149
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:38,358
You are utterly lacking in
style... You're no butler!

150
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,858
I'd never lose to someone
so hopelessly inferior.

151
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:52,150
Aww! That's my Bassy.
So stylish!

152
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:55,442
So he was a doll, too?

153
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:57,317
His name was
Drossel Keinz...

154
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,983
His soul was collected
five years ago...

155
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:03,317
but we still detected
signs of his existence.

156
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,483
He must have been fitted
with a transient soul

157
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,442
by somebody...
His master, maybe.

158
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,858
Ciel...

159
00:14:11,942 --> 00:14:16,025
You're awake...!
Let's get you home.

160
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:21,567
I want to give you... a real
birthday party... Can I?

161
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:29,108
Okay... we'll have a party.

162
00:14:37,025 --> 00:14:40,067
You can rest easy now
Lizzy... It's all over.

163
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,067
It appears that it's not.

164
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,942
So then... I thought...

165
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:50,692
To myself... I still
have a task... I...

166
00:14:50,775 --> 00:14:55,067
Must report...
to my... master.

167
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,067
What's wrong with this loon...?

168
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,442
He's all torn up and he still
wants to serve his master?

169
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,692
Perhaps I judged him
too hastily.

170
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:05,983
He may be...
one hell of a butler.

171
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:09,483
Master... It's me...

172
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:24,442
Why is he here?

173
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:29,942
And why... is he so friendly?

174
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:32,192
I'm terribly sorry.

175
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:34,400
My butler's incompetence
prevents me

176
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:36,692
from offering
you hospitality.

177
00:15:36,775 --> 00:15:38,567
You're the one
behind this...?

178
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,567
Why would you want to turn
little girls into dolls?

179
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,858
Perfection is so
difficult to attain...

180
00:15:44,942 --> 00:15:47,733
And when it is achieved,
it is fleeting.

181
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:51,483
Doll making is noble work...
It preserves that which is

182
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:53,483
most beautiful in this world...

183
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:57,983
A doll is a perfect little
person, forever frozen in time.

184
00:15:58,067 --> 00:15:59,775
I have to disagree...

185
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,400
Those little brats
of yours were anything

186
00:16:01,483 --> 00:16:02,900
but lovely--

187
00:16:02,983 --> 00:16:07,400
Why are you after me? You won't
win. I'm no one's doll...

188
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:09,817
And I will never be a part
of your collection...

189
00:16:10,858 --> 00:16:12,442
Here's your ring!

190
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:16,858
You ought to learn
your place, boy.

191
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,317
What?

192
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,608
My butler's head
was filled with straw...

193
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:23,025
With such limited intellect...

194
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:27,233
I don't imagine he could
understand why I wanted you.

195
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:29,817
Ciel Phantomhive...

196
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,525
the manner of your death
has been fated

197
00:16:31,608 --> 00:16:33,567
since the day
of your birth.

198
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:37,233
That body you wear...
is unclean.

199
00:16:42,108 --> 00:16:45,983
But how... how could
you know about that?

200
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:49,858
I cannot allow someone like
you to live in this world...

201
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,442
Your existence
is a desecration.

202
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:57,608
Unclean... unnecessary...
unwanted...

203
00:16:57,692 --> 00:16:59,775
That is why I intend
to erase you.

204
00:16:59,858 --> 00:17:01,358
What?!

205
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:08,650
Snuff him out. He is unclean,
unnecessary, unwanted...

206
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:10,858
End him! End him! End him!

207
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:12,317
Stop talking!

208
00:17:21,317 --> 00:17:22,692
It's a puppet.

209
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:43,192
Sebastian...!
Go catch that thing!

210
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:46,192
The person pulling the strings
is elsewhere my lord...

211
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:49,025
It wouldn't do us any good
to give chase.

212
00:17:49,108 --> 00:17:50,567
Now I see...

213
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,317
There were hidden strings woven
throughout the entire room.

214
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:56,150
How very unpleasant.

215
00:18:03,358 --> 00:18:08,483
Bassy...! My love!
It's time for our kiss!

216
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:14,400
Well, young master... what now?

217
00:18:14,483 --> 00:18:17,358
Would you like me to
avenge Madam Red for you?

218
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:21,692
Okay, on second thought, the
kiss can wait until next time!

219
00:18:22,942 --> 00:18:24,983
Bye-bye, Bassy!

220
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:25,775
Wait Grell!

221
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:27,692
No, leave it... Not today.

222
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,983
Elizabeth's here...

223
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:34,733
I don't want her to see
any more bloodshed.

224
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:45,483
Look at that...

225
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:48,525
It's little Lord
Phantomhive's birthday today.

226
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:52,400
Somehow I doubt he's
celebrating the occasion.

227
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,483
I'm sorry, Sir Arthur...!

228
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:56,817
I was looking into
the Hope Diamond,

229
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,400
and I became sidetracked.

230
00:18:59,192 --> 00:19:01,733
It's not a bad idea
to investigate him.

231
00:19:01,817 --> 00:19:02,733
Huh?

232
00:19:02,817 --> 00:19:04,817
He receives special
treatment...

233
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,317
including access to information
even we at the Yard

234
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,317
can't obtain.

235
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,233
He wags his tail
for the queen...

236
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:16,233
marking all territory as his...
The queen's damned guard dog.

237
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,692
Guard dog...?

238
00:19:27,192 --> 00:19:29,400
Well, whatever this
kid's secrets are...

239
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:31,400
There can't be a child
in the whole world

240
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:33,775
who wouldn't want to
celebrate his birthday.

241
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:44,067
Happy birthday, Ciel!

242
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:48,150
Happy birthday
to you, master!

243
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:50,025
This is fun... see!

244
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:52,733
Best birthday party
ever... hooray!

245
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:56,317
Master, shall I serve
the pudding now?

246
00:19:58,983 --> 00:20:00,150
What a bother...

247
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,608
You could have just
cut it in the kitchen.

248
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:10,733
What is this?

249
00:20:10,817 --> 00:20:12,442
Well, the season
is almost upon us...

250
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:14,733
so it is a traditional
Christmas pudding...

251
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:17,442
Whoever's piece has the ring
in it is guaranteed happiness

252
00:20:17,525 --> 00:20:18,775
throughout the new year...

253
00:20:18,858 --> 00:20:20,733
It seems you've found
the ring, Maste--

254
00:20:23,108 --> 00:20:24,400
Did you hear that...?

255
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:27,233
You can finally be happy
again... I'm so glad!

256
00:20:27,317 --> 00:20:28,275
I don't think--

257
00:20:28,358 --> 00:20:29,608
Paula!... The bells!

258
00:20:29,692 --> 00:20:31,567
Yes...! Right away...!

259
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:36,108
Jingle, jingle, jingle,
jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle!

260
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,567
How ridiculous.

261
00:20:49,525 --> 00:20:54,608
All I cared about, all I
wanted, was to see Ciel smile.

262
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:59,067
I want him to be happy...
like he was before...

263
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,150
Always.
Always.

264
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:11,567
You have such a good heart.
Sleep well my lady.

265
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:18,567
I cast this ring away...
And now here it is again.

266
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,650
Today's events aside... It's
still a present Lady Elizabeth

267
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:25,942
went to great trouble to
acquire for you. Besides...

268
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:29,192
Cursed ring or not...
I will always protect you.

269
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,192
What do we know
about the mansion?

270
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:37,192
Well... It's been empty
for quite some time...

271
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:39,108
Its owner,
the Earl of Mandalay,

272
00:21:39,192 --> 00:21:41,733
currently resides
in a sanatorium.

273
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:45,233
In all likelihood, he has
nothing to do with this, then.

274
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:47,650
Yes... so it would seem.

275
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:49,942
But still... that crest we saw.

276
00:21:53,817 --> 00:21:55,650
Is there something
bothering you?

277
00:21:55,733 --> 00:22:00,525
Nothing... I'm going to
retire now... I'm tired.

278
00:22:00,608 --> 00:22:03,275
Yes... as you wish, my lord.

279
00:22:07,358 --> 00:22:10,400
Snuff him out. He is unclean,
unnecessary, unwanted...

280
00:22:10,483 --> 00:22:11,483
Snuff him out.

281
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:13,525
He is unclean,
unnecessary, unwanted...

282
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:15,442
End the unclean.
End the unnecessary.

283
00:22:15,525 --> 00:22:16,900
End the unwanted!

284
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:20,275
Snuff out the unclean...
the unwanted...

285
00:22:20,358 --> 00:22:24,275
Snuff out the unnecessary...
snuff out the unwanted.

286
00:22:27,317 --> 00:22:29,358
Snuff out the unclean.

287
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,358
End him.

288
00:24:12,275 --> 00:24:13,900
An odd fellow has
come to visit us

289
00:24:13,983 --> 00:24:15,942
all the way from
exotic India...

290
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:19,358
Prince Soma's immaturity
rivals even that of a certain

291
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:21,525
Earl I know.

292
00:24:21,608 --> 00:24:26,275
He is personally attended by a
competent butler named Agni...

293
00:24:26,358 --> 00:24:27,692
Young master...

294
00:24:27,775 --> 00:24:29,567
That particular pairing
seems to be rather popular

295
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,317
as of late.

296
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,733
Next time on Black Butler,
"His Butler, Freeloader."

297
00:24:35,817 --> 00:24:38,317
You see... I am simply
one hell of a butler.
