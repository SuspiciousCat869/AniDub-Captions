1
00:00:27,817 --> 00:00:30,400
The name of your
target is unimportant.

2
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:34,858
There's only one thing
you're good for.

3
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,317
This is in the way.

4
00:00:45,858 --> 00:00:47,733
You were made for this...

5
00:00:47,817 --> 00:00:51,858
That's why you were born
with those inhuman eyes.

6
00:00:51,942 --> 00:00:55,858
The better to see your
prey... Understand?

7
00:01:08,858 --> 00:01:11,400
There's only one thing
you're good for.

8
00:01:14,692 --> 00:01:18,483
You have incredible eyes. I'd
like to offer you a position.

9
00:01:20,608 --> 00:01:23,108
Room and board would be
included, of course.

10
00:01:28,858 --> 00:01:31,900
No experience necessary.

11
00:01:31,983 --> 00:01:35,067
I'll teach you everything you
need to know if you agree.

12
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:42,442
And what would
I have to do?

13
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:50,192
I've engaged a housemaid.

14
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:51,358
This way.

15
00:02:10,817 --> 00:02:13,400
A skirt. That's new.

16
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,900
A gift from the young master.

17
00:02:22,983 --> 00:02:24,358
"Master?"

18
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:27,150
Goodmornin'...
Hope you slept well sir.

19
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,400
Good morning...

20
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:31,358
Master?

21
00:04:31,442 --> 00:04:33,317
Feeling down, he is.

22
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,358
'Fraid so.

23
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:35,650
Oh...?

24
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,692
How can you be so certain
about that, Bardroy?

25
00:04:37,775 --> 00:04:40,567
Well he may look the same
as ever to an outsider...

26
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,608
but his servants can see the
difference clear as day.

27
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:47,275
So we'll just have
to do our best to give

28
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:49,483
the young master's
spirits a boost!

29
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:51,233
That's a brilliant idea!

30
00:04:51,317 --> 00:04:53,233
We're gonna throw him a party!

31
00:04:53,317 --> 00:04:54,317
Party!

32
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,817
Equanimity.

33
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,900
What's "Equanimity?"

34
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:05,025
I think it's to do
with equal 'nimities.'

35
00:05:05,108 --> 00:05:06,942
I think Tanaka means
we should help the Earl

36
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:08,733
relax by keeping
things normal.

37
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:10,567
Oh, hey, we can do that...!

38
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,567
I'll polish the manor 'til
it gleams like new, yes I will.

39
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,858
And I think it's time
to pull out a few

40
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:16,942
of my special secret recipes.

41
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,858
I'll make sure all the trees
on the grounds are healthy

42
00:05:18,942 --> 00:05:19,900
as can be.

43
00:05:19,983 --> 00:05:21,150
Let's go!

44
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:22,608
Right!

45
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:32,233
Cut that out, Pluto!

46
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:37,733
You sure are full
of energy today.

47
00:05:42,483 --> 00:05:47,150
Nooo! Please don't eat them,
Plutoooo! Nooooo!!

48
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,608
Sorry, little birdies!

49
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:54,983
Oh... Sorry to you too, boy.

50
00:05:56,358 --> 00:05:59,025
You know it's funny...
Before I came here,

51
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,900
the birds were my only
real friends.

52
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,067
But, since I started
working for the Earl...

53
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,567
I've been able to
go outside every single day...

54
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,067
rain or shine!

55
00:06:09,358 --> 00:06:10,608
Sometimes...

56
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:14,650
I wonder what it was like
for the young master...

57
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:16,442
before we all got here.

58
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,192
Smell something?

59
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:31,525
I imagine this year's
Exposition will be grand...

60
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:34,733
It is the 100th anniversary
of the French Revolution.

61
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:37,025
They're building
a colossal tower in Paris

62
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:38,692
for the World's Fair, I hear.

63
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:41,442
The 'Eiffel Tower' I
believe they're calling it.

64
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:44,108
Yes.

65
00:06:44,192 --> 00:06:46,567
Doesn't it recall you
to the Tower of Babel...

66
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,942
when the people
incurred God's wrath

67
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:50,483
trying to build a tower
to the heavens?

68
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:53,150
Yes.

69
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,733
Ashe has informed me...

70
00:06:54,817 --> 00:06:56,400
Her Majesty will be
traveling covertly

71
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:59,233
to Paris to see it for herself.

72
00:06:59,317 --> 00:07:00,775
Yes.

73
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:02,900
Will Earl Grey do today, sir?

74
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:06,192
Yes.

75
00:07:06,275 --> 00:07:08,442
Once upon a time,
in a land far away,

76
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:11,358
there lived an old man
and an even older woman.

77
00:07:11,442 --> 00:07:13,358
What the devil
are you talking about.

78
00:07:13,442 --> 00:07:16,567
Ah...!.. So you are
listening to me, my lord.

79
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,275
Yes of course I am.

80
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,317
Has there been any word
from Her Majesty

81
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,442
about the incident
the other day?

82
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:28,733
None. I'm sorry.

83
00:07:28,817 --> 00:07:31,650
I see. Good then.

84
00:07:36,692 --> 00:07:38,317
I'll make it all clean.

85
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,483
I'll make it all nice
and sparkly, yes I will.

86
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,233
Mey Rin

87
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:45,108
Yes, Sebastian?

88
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:47,650
What are you doing?

89
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:51,150
Why, I'm cleaning. I'm
polishing the railing, yes I--

90
00:07:53,942 --> 00:07:57,358
I mistook the shoe polish
for wax, I did.

91
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:02,025
Mey Rin, dear...

92
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:04,400
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?...

93
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:07,025
Are you in need of a
different pair of spectacles?

94
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:08,358
Oh no!

95
00:08:08,442 --> 00:08:09,817
These were a gift from the
young master, they were.

96
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,858
Please don't take them
away from me!

97
00:08:13,942 --> 00:08:16,067
Very well... Clean this off

98
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,025
as soon as possible,
won't you?

99
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:21,108
Yes, sir! Right away, sir!

100
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,775
I should see if lunch
preparations are under way,

101
00:08:26,858 --> 00:08:28,233
I suppose.

102
00:08:34,608 --> 00:08:36,317
Bardroy!

103
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,442
I do not approve of dynamite
as a cooking utensil...

104
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,650
I believe I've
mentioned this before.

105
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:42,858
Sorry,

106
00:08:42,942 --> 00:08:45,025
I just thought it would
be faster this way.

107
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,233
Why must you always
be in such a hurry?

108
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:49,442
There's plenty of time
to get everything done.

109
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:52,483
Yeah, I guess logically
I know that's true...

110
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:55,150
It's just, in the past, if I
didn't hurry up makin' my food,

111
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:58,900
I didn't eat. You know?
So I always end up

112
00:08:58,983 --> 00:09:01,067
rushin' and messing things up.

113
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:04,608
Problem is, I've never
got used to peace...

114
00:09:04,692 --> 00:09:06,358
So I don't really know
what to do with myself

115
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:08,150
in a quiet place like this.

116
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,108
I'll prepare the
master's lunch.

117
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:17,233
You stay here...
and clean this place up.

118
00:09:17,317 --> 00:09:19,525
Damn! Alright.

119
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:27,400
Well then... There's
nothing more to say...

120
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,525
Is there?

121
00:09:28,608 --> 00:09:29,983
Why do you insist
on doing this alone?

122
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:32,358
Why won't you
ask anyone for help!?

123
00:09:32,442 --> 00:09:34,858
I don't need
anyone on my side.

124
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:38,525
I'm the one playing the game.
All I need are my pawns.

125
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:41,317
I'll be on your side.

126
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:43,983
He was such a fool!

127
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:49,108
You want to know what it was
like before we got here?

128
00:09:50,483 --> 00:09:52,067
Well, the only one
who'd know that...

129
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,317
would be Tanaka
now wouldn't it.

130
00:09:57,233 --> 00:10:00,525
And I wouldn't bother. Askin'
that bloc's a waste of time.

131
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:03,150
There is one more person
we can ask, I think.

132
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:04,400
Yeah?

133
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,692
You want to know about
the Phantomhive manor?

134
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:13,317
Yes... We were wondering
what it was like here,

135
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,067
before we were all hired.

136
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:19,733
I remember it so well...

137
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:24,317
Ciel's father and mother and
aunt, they smiled all the time.

138
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Ciel did, too. All the time!

139
00:10:27,483 --> 00:10:31,608
The Phantomhive home
was always full of smiles.

140
00:10:31,692 --> 00:10:32,942
That's it!

141
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:39,483
We just have to fill the
manor full of smiles again!

142
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:41,733
That'll help the master
recover his spirits again,

143
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:43,108
yes it will!

144
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:48,150
I love it...! Oh, it's perfect!

145
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:49,608
Right...

146
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:52,817
We just supposed to smile
like lunatics for no reason?

147
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,900
No. We do it
for the young master.

148
00:10:55,983 --> 00:10:58,275
Yeah! Smile, Bard!
Smile come on!

149
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,983
Fine! Alright! Ding!

150
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:04,025
Oh, goodie!
I'll help out as well.

151
00:11:20,983 --> 00:11:23,233
What's happening?!

152
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,317
What was the meaning of that?

153
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:37,900
There's some time
yet before dinner...

154
00:11:37,983 --> 00:11:41,442
Please repair to the salon
until then, ladies.

155
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:43,067
What is going on, Sebastian?

156
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,025
Um, Lady Elizabeth?

157
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:52,108
Yes, I forgot... Keep smiling.

158
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,692
This way, please,
young mistress.

159
00:11:59,775 --> 00:12:02,358
Take care of this...
I'll leave it to you three.

160
00:12:09,983 --> 00:12:11,358
Now, then...

161
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:40,525
Hello! Did you miss me, Ciel?

162
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:45,025
Hello, Elizabeth...
When did you get here...?

163
00:12:45,108 --> 00:12:46,942
You might send a footman
over to warn me.

164
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:50,275
Everytime I want to see my
fiancée? Don't be silly.

165
00:12:50,358 --> 00:12:52,317
Now. Teach me to play chess.

166
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,650
Right now?

167
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:56,608
Oh, yes... A lady who
knows nothing about chess

168
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,900
knows nothing at all...

169
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,025
That's what my mother
has always said to me...

170
00:13:00,108 --> 00:13:02,442
Only I'm having
a hard time learning it...

171
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:05,442
And Paula is positively
hopeless, naturally...

172
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:08,983
So you're the only one I
can ask...! Please, Ciel?

173
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:11,400
Please...? Just for me?

174
00:13:13,317 --> 00:13:15,150
Pardon me.

175
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:16,525
Good. Sebastian.

176
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:17,900
Yes, my lord.

177
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:20,108
We'll be needing
the chessboard.

178
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:22,400
Of course... Right away.

179
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,775
There are sixty four squares
on this chessboard.

180
00:13:39,858 --> 00:13:41,817
Your objective is to checkmate
your opponent's king

181
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,567
by moving your pieces one
at a time until he is trapped.

182
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:54,942
Damn it! What are you
trying to do?

183
00:13:55,025 --> 00:13:57,150
Oh, it's lovely, isn't it?

184
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:06,442
What's wrong?

185
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:08,608
It's just been such a long time
since we did anything fun

186
00:14:08,692 --> 00:14:10,150
together like this.

187
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:13,733
White moves first.

188
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:15,233
Right!

189
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:36,233
Is something wrong?

190
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:38,900
No... Nothing.

191
00:14:53,483 --> 00:14:56,525
Just like I told them
it would happen!

192
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:58,858
This battlement is
a weak point in their line.

193
00:14:58,942 --> 00:15:01,525
We'll break through here and
penetrate their territory.

194
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:04,067
But sir...!
That's obviously a trap.

195
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,858
Oh is that so, Sergeant...?

196
00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:07,775
Or could it be you've
simply lost your nerve?

197
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:10,150
No, sir...! I just
think we should

198
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:11,317
look for another way.

199
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,025
That's enough...!
We march on my order!

200
00:15:31,442 --> 00:15:34,525
Are you listening to me now,
you old bastard?

201
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:37,400
My, my. What a mess.

202
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:40,900
Not even a grim reaper
could create such chaos.

203
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:44,108
You have superb instincts,
and an amazing ability

204
00:15:44,192 --> 00:15:48,567
to evade any trap.
I find you quite promising.

205
00:15:50,108 --> 00:15:53,608
Are you an enemy?
Or an ally?

206
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:56,067
Oh neither,

207
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,650
I assure you... No... I'm
simply one hell of a butler.

208
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,817
Oi...! If I were you I'd
have that looked at

209
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,400
right away, otherwise
you'll probably die.

210
00:16:09,483 --> 00:16:10,567
Oh yeah!

211
00:16:20,192 --> 00:16:21,817
I can promise you all this...

212
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,817
that little curr will be gone
soon enough. And once he is...

213
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,567
there is money to be made
in this country.

214
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:32,275
As for noblemen
with dirt on their hands...

215
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,108
Their time has passed.

216
00:16:55,442 --> 00:16:56,775
I'm sorry,

217
00:16:56,858 --> 00:16:58,858
but I've sworn to protect
this estate with my life.

218
00:16:58,942 --> 00:17:03,358
Oh, right, I forgot to smile!
That's how we're gonna bring

219
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:06,692
the masters spirits
back up! Ding...

220
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:11,442
Ow! Hot-hot-hot- hot!

221
00:17:11,525 --> 00:17:13,775
Help!

222
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:19,150
Let's see... that's the knight,
and the rook, and the pawn,

223
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:22,483
and there's the bishop...
Is that right?

224
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:23,567
Yes.

225
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:25,858
I got them all?

226
00:18:12,275 --> 00:18:14,192
No... Stop it!

227
00:18:14,275 --> 00:18:16,067
Someday this drug will
give you strength you've

228
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,858
never dreamed of, boy.

229
00:18:44,483 --> 00:18:46,608
You're not hurt from me
bumping into you?

230
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:49,150
Actually, your incredible
strength is the reason I'm here

231
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:52,525
to offer you a position.
You'll receive regular wages,

232
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:55,442
plus incentive pay and a
large twice-yearly bonus.

233
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:58,858
I don't need any of that...
I just want--

234
00:19:04,692 --> 00:19:06,525
I want to go outside!

235
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,942
It's beautiful!

236
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:28,150
Take this!

237
00:19:36,858 --> 00:19:38,608
And that... that's
the king, isn't it?

238
00:19:38,692 --> 00:19:41,275
That's right.

239
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:46,817
And this is his queen.
Chess is so cute!

240
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:50,442
It would appear
that your beloved Queen

241
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:52,233
is trying to plunge Europe,
not to mention

242
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:55,067
the rest of the world,
into full-scale war...

243
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,192
I suppose, she'll trigger it
by attacking France through

244
00:19:58,275 --> 00:20:01,067
the opium trade with this
new drug, Lady Blanc...

245
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,983
Just as your country invaded
my own by inundating it

246
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:07,525
with opium not so long ago,
leading to the Opium Wars.

247
00:20:08,817 --> 00:20:10,817
Do you think you'll still
be her little guard dog

248
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,108
when the guns start
firing, my lord?

249
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:18,567
Me... I'll be on your side,
Ciel... I will.

250
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:21,900
You do have a chance, Ciel...

251
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:26,608
to move forward, and build a
brand new future for yourself.

252
00:20:27,525 --> 00:20:32,483
Don't ever forget that...
Promise...You won't...

253
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:40,650
Who the hell are
these people!?

254
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:45,983
If we couldn't do this much
for the young master...

255
00:20:46,067 --> 00:20:48,525
what kind of Phantomhive
servants would we be?

256
00:20:55,858 --> 00:20:59,067
Master... Lady Elizabeth...
I'm afraid that I must

257
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,608
excuse myself to begin
dinner preparations.

258
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:03,692
Fine.

259
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:06,483
Thank you for the
music, Sebastian.

260
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:08,942
Why don't we
stop here for today.

261
00:21:09,025 --> 00:21:10,358
'Kay.

262
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:16,108
Thank you, as always,
for your excellent work.

263
00:21:27,358 --> 00:21:29,317
Paris...

264
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:40,525
The true Doomsday
will arrive in due time.

265
00:21:53,775 --> 00:21:56,525
You had more leisure time today
than you've had in a while...

266
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,525
I assume that you were able
to fret to your satisfaction?

267
00:21:59,608 --> 00:22:01,692
I'm not fretting, Sebastian.

268
00:22:13,525 --> 00:22:16,692
You all look wretched... Go and
change your clothes at once.

269
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:18,525
Yes, young master!

270
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:32,483
For today's
main dish my lord...

271
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:35,275
we have filet de boeuf
a la Parisienne...

272
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:37,442
A most delightful
Parisian-style

273
00:22:37,525 --> 00:22:39,192
grilled filet of beef.

274
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:15,358
Master. In your young life
you've known far too much pain.

275
00:24:15,442 --> 00:24:19,442
You're a young bird yet, with
frail bones, weak talons,

276
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:24,400
but you defy fate again and
again. You are a good boy,

277
00:24:24,483 --> 00:24:28,942
far too fragile, too broken
to kill, too much hangs upon

278
00:24:29,025 --> 00:24:32,733
that moment, can't be
spoiled by such weakness...

279
00:24:32,817 --> 00:24:34,858
Next time, on
Black Butler:

280
00:24:34,942 --> 00:24:36,692
"His Butler, Dissolution."

281
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,442
You see, I am simply
one hell of a butler...
