1
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,733
So, young master...

2
00:02:19,817 --> 00:02:22,358
you wanted to speak with
us about something?

3
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,858
Yes, I have a little job

4
00:02:23,942 --> 00:02:25,733
for the three of you
to take care of.

5
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:26,608
J

6
00:02:26,692 --> 00:02:27,192
O

7
00:02:27,275 --> 00:02:28,192
B?!

8
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:30,817
See, we didn't
have to worry!

9
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,983
When he called us, I thought
for sure we were fired,

10
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:34,900
yes I did! Whew!

11
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,317
This is a camera from the
famous Talbot collection...

12
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,025
It has a story
behind it.

13
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:44,025
It had been missing from
the collection altogether

14
00:02:44,108 --> 00:02:45,067
for some time...

15
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,400
When it suddenly came up
for auction,

16
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:47,900
I bid immediately.

17
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:49,317
Who's Talbot?

18
00:02:53,358 --> 00:02:55,733
Full name William Henry
Fox Talbot...

19
00:02:55,817 --> 00:02:56,817
Let's see...

20
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,317
He was a renowned
English scientist

21
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,192
and one of the inventors of
photographic technology.

22
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:03,858
There were some strange
rumors about the last camera

23
00:03:03,942 --> 00:03:04,942
he used...

24
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:07,233
the one our young master
has acquired...

25
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:09,650
Legend has it that if you
use this camera

26
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:11,067
to photograph someone...

27
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,650
whomever or whatever that
person cares about

28
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:15,192
most in the world

29
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:17,525
will appear in the
photograph as well.

30
00:03:17,608 --> 00:03:20,108
Oh, my! That sounds too
incredible to be true!

31
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,150
Can such a camera really
exist, or is it just rumor?

32
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:26,900
Perhaps we should take
a picture and find out.

33
00:03:26,983 --> 00:03:30,025
Don't move... The exposure
takes ten seconds.

34
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,150
Uh...what exactly
is 'exposure'?

35
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:38,317
Basically, the camera is
copying down an image of Finni.

36
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,358
Stay still or the
image will blur

37
00:03:40,442 --> 00:03:42,192
and we won't get
a good picture.

38
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:46,358
8... 9... 10...all done.

39
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:49,608
You didn't have to hold
your breath the whole time.

40
00:03:56,108 --> 00:03:59,275
Wow! Look at that...!
It's my bird!

41
00:03:59,358 --> 00:04:01,775
Huh? Since when do you
have a pet bird?

42
00:04:01,858 --> 00:04:04,650
Aw, it's so cute!

43
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:06,483
I gave it food
every day...

44
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:08,900
Eventually it started
eating out of my hand...

45
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:12,733
I was so happy, I went to
give it a gentle pat and...

46
00:04:15,108 --> 00:04:17,150
My little friend
never moved again.

47
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:18,775
Are you saying that he...?

48
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:26,067
Yes, I forgot to
mention something...

49
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,608
The camera has one other
unique attribute.

50
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:31,442
The new soul that it will
show is not of this world...

51
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:34,233
To put it plainly...
the dead appear.

52
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:35,275
Only the dead?

53
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,900
You mean ghosts?!

54
00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:39,942
You can see why I would be so
interested in this camera...

55
00:04:40,025 --> 00:04:42,150
Not only does it know who
you care for the most

56
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:45,025
but it reaches into the other
world to photograph them.

57
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:48,733
But this is the
nineteenth century.

58
00:04:48,817 --> 00:04:51,192
Surely nobody believes
a story like that now.

59
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:52,775
That sounds amazing...!

60
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:55,650
What an incredible
camera, master!

61
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:59,317
I miss my poor little birdie!

62
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:02,150
Take a picture of Sebastian
with this camera...

63
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,483
but do it discreetly.

64
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:05,733
I don't what him to know
what you're up to.

65
00:05:06,692 --> 00:05:08,650
You want us to take
a candid photo?

66
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,358
That's right.

67
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:12,025
Really? The photograph
will show us

68
00:05:12,108 --> 00:05:14,025
who Sebastian
cares for most?

69
00:05:14,108 --> 00:05:15,942
That's something
I'd like to see.

70
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:17,108
Bloody right Finni.

71
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,525
He's always bossing us
around and mockin

72
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:20,150
my artistic
cooking methods.

73
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:21,900
He's as human
as we are!

74
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:24,192
He's got to have at least
a weakness or two...

75
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:26,817
and now's our chance
to see 'em!

76
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,983
You'll handle it?

77
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:30,317
As you wish,
young master!

78
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,983
Yeah...! That was a pretty
good impression of 'im, eh?

79
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:34,483
Just like him!

80
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:35,983
There's no telling
what will appear

81
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:39,608
if we take a picture of him
with this camera.

82
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:41,733
This should be interesting.

83
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:53,067
Let's see...
at this time of day

84
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,233
...he's in the library.

85
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,233
He needs to stay still.

86
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:02,108
For a full ten
seconds, yes.

87
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:03,692
I hope this works!

88
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:09,275
He's fast!

89
00:06:09,358 --> 00:06:11,483
He's so fast I can't
even see him!

90
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:13,858
Damn, we'll never
get that photo!

91
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,275
Look...! He stopped.

92
00:06:17,358 --> 00:06:18,567
Great...! Let's go!

93
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,650
I forgot to take
the picture.

94
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:32,400
He's so wonderful
to watch!

95
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:34,942
And next...

96
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:37,025
He'll straighten up
every room.

97
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:47,067
Look ooooouuuuuuuttt!

98
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,233
And after that...

99
00:07:06,317 --> 00:07:08,525
He'll work on records
in the office.

100
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:18,608
Come in.

101
00:07:18,692 --> 00:07:20,400
Yes? Did you need
something, master?

102
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,233
It came undone.

103
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:26,900
Of course, my lord.

104
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:32,942
He's beautiful in profile,
too, yes he is!

105
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:34,983
All right, now
just stay there!

106
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:38,442
Four... five... six...

107
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,567
Let's air this room
out a bit, shall we?

108
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,858
This is turning out
to be a lot harder

109
00:07:57,942 --> 00:07:59,275
than I thought
it would...

110
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:01,900
Getting one measly photograph
shouldn't be so tough.

111
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,025
There you are. I have a task
for the three of you.

112
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:09,025
What is it, Sebastian?

113
00:08:09,108 --> 00:08:10,233
Over there.

114
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:14,942
The mangy pooch?
What do you want us to do?

115
00:08:15,025 --> 00:08:17,358
We'll be receiving a guest
this afternoon...

116
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:18,942
That thing is offensive...

117
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:22,108
You are to transfer it out of
sight before our guest arrives.

118
00:08:22,192 --> 00:08:24,483
He's kind of a big fella.
Where should we put him?

119
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:26,733
I'll let you three
figure that out.

120
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:31,067
Oi...! We've got our own jobs
to take care of, too ya know.

121
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,233
You do have until
this afternoon...

122
00:08:33,317 --> 00:08:34,608
I'm sure you can
take care of it

123
00:08:34,692 --> 00:08:36,567
in between your
other tasks.

124
00:08:40,942 --> 00:08:44,192
Maybe now I can do my own
job without interruption.

125
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,358
Plu-Plu...! Come here!

126
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:01,400
Up you goooo!

127
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,692
Oh, wow.
Now there's a surprise...

128
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:16,900
Who knew Pluto
could breathe fire?

129
00:09:16,983 --> 00:09:18,900
Well, that's a demon hound
for you...

130
00:09:18,983 --> 00:09:21,358
Hold on! We don't have time
for standing around!

131
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:29,025
Honestly, what's
taking them so long?

132
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:30,025
Something wrong?

133
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:31,775
No...it's nothing...

134
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:34,608
I think I'll take
my supper in here today.

135
00:09:34,692 --> 00:09:36,317
Of course, my lord.

136
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:06,567
They couldn't handle
one simple task...?

137
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,983
I'm beginning
to think those three

138
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:10,108
would be more useful
as dog food.

139
00:10:15,108 --> 00:10:16,400
How lovely.

140
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:31,983
A lithe, supple body...
And paws...

141
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:37,858
Such soft paws.
Cats are perfect.

142
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:49,400
Interrupted again...

143
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,817
Can a butler get
no peace around here?

144
00:10:55,192 --> 00:10:57,192
We're so sorry, master.

145
00:10:57,275 --> 00:10:59,192
B-But Bard thought up
a really good plan,

146
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:00,733
yes he did.

147
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:03,025
The idea came to me earlier when
I saw the dog breathe fire.

148
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:05,692
I hope this new plan doesn't
involve a flamethrower.

149
00:11:05,775 --> 00:11:07,692
Damn.

150
00:11:07,775 --> 00:11:09,858
My lord. Hello!

151
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:11,067
Oh, it's Mr. Lau!

152
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,567
And what are you
doing here?

153
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,858
I heard what
you were up to.

154
00:11:13,942 --> 00:11:15,358
I thought I might assist.

155
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,400
Go away.

156
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:18,483
My lord, please
don't be so hasty...

157
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:21,067
Why not relax and
leave this up to me?

158
00:11:22,317 --> 00:11:25,358
I have already woven a
spider's web to trap him...

159
00:11:25,442 --> 00:11:27,817
and the more he tries to
struggle... the more entangled

160
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,400
he'll become.
Escape is impossible.

161
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:33,983
Against me... no prey
stands a chance...

162
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:36,025
It is only
a matter of time.

163
00:11:37,942 --> 00:11:41,317
Very well... But I will
not tolerate any failure.

164
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,192
Is that understood?

165
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:45,567
Yes... of course, my lord...

166
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,608
I would not allow failure to
sully the Phantomhive name...

167
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:50,192
I would surely be booted out
of the country

168
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:51,817
if I did such a thing.

169
00:11:53,483 --> 00:11:55,192
So...what are you up to?

170
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:05,525
Welcome, sir.

171
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:07,692
Hello I'm the writer from
Brit Business...

172
00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:09,567
Paul Jones sir.

173
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,692
Indeed, Mister Jones... We've
been awaiting your arrival...

174
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,692
If you'd follow me inside.

175
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:22,858
Now... our plan begins.

176
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,400
That was your big plan?

177
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:45,775
Quite odd... How could it
have failed...?

178
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:47,275
Just look at her, my lord.

179
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:50,192
I was sure even the butler
would stop a moment to stare.

180
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:51,733
I was fool for
ever believing

181
00:12:51,817 --> 00:12:53,692
you could handle
something like this.

182
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:55,692
I have only
begun to fight!

183
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:12,400
Not her...! Now,
where's Sebastian?

184
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:15,900
Coming, sir?

185
00:13:15,983 --> 00:13:17,900
Oh...! Yes, of course!

186
00:13:19,817 --> 00:13:22,275
How strange...
I don't understand.

187
00:13:22,358 --> 00:13:24,817
What a spectacular waste
of time that was.

188
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:32,483
If I may sir,
allow me to introduce

189
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:35,025
Funtom's General
Director Tanaka.

190
00:13:35,108 --> 00:13:37,483
Ho ho ho

191
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,650
I'll start in on my
questions then.

192
00:13:43,358 --> 00:13:46,525
What's wrong...? Why is he
in there all by himself...?

193
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:48,192
Is he sulking
or something?

194
00:13:48,275 --> 00:13:49,942
He said he wanted
to take a little time

195
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:51,817
to think things
over alone.

196
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,608
He seems to be taking this
quite seriously.

197
00:13:56,608 --> 00:13:59,817
We need him to stand still
for ten full seconds.

198
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:04,900
This is the one thing
I didn't want to resort to.

199
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:07,650
But he's left me with
no other choice.

200
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:13,733
And now...
Could you please tell me

201
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:17,733
about Funtom's business
strategy moving forward?

202
00:14:17,817 --> 00:14:19,983
Ho Ho Ho

203
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,192
Huh?!

204
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:22,900
Allow me to explain...

205
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:25,775
Currently we are focusing
on toys and confections...

206
00:14:25,858 --> 00:14:29,150
but we intend to expand
into other areas as well.

207
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,567
As I was saying, sir...

208
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,900
Oh... yes?

209
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,442
The company is working on
plans to build outlets

210
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:45,692
across Europe.

211
00:14:45,775 --> 00:14:47,400
We'll begin with branches
in Paris, Vienna,

212
00:14:47,483 --> 00:14:50,025
Berlin, Rome, Amsterdam,
and Athens.

213
00:14:50,108 --> 00:14:51,650
We intend to expand
into thirty countries

214
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:52,942
over the next
five years,

215
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,025
including those in
North America.

216
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,025
We'll also build a
confection factory

217
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:00,733
in Provence in
the south of France

218
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,067
and a toy factory
in Salzburg, Austria.

219
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,108
This will ensure that an
ample supply of our goods

220
00:15:05,192 --> 00:15:06,442
is available.

221
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:10,983
We at the Funtom Company
always strive to maintain

222
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:13,150
and improve the quality
of goods and services

223
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:14,483
supplied to
our customers.

224
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:16,400
No item leaves one of our
factories without first

225
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:19,400
being subjected to numerous
quality assurance tests.

226
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:22,400
Only then can a product bear
the name "Funtom."

227
00:15:24,608 --> 00:15:26,900
Our motto is "The customer
always comes first."

228
00:15:26,983 --> 00:15:28,233
Our delivery system
allows us

229
00:15:28,317 --> 00:15:30,025
to arrive at your business
or residence,

230
00:15:30,108 --> 00:15:31,608
product in hand,
in record in time,

231
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:33,983
however remote the location.
Customer satisfaction

232
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:38,150
is guaranteed. That is the
Phantomhive way! See?

233
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,233
That's everything.

234
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,150
Th-Thank you very much...

235
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:48,525
But before I go, I would like
to get a photograph, if I may.

236
00:15:48,608 --> 00:15:49,733
Photo?

237
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:51,567
I'd like to have you
in the shot, too.

238
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,650
I'm afraid
I must decline.

239
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:56,192
You see, I'm simply
one hell of a butler.

240
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:02,942
Today we are serving
Demon Hound Bean Cakes...

241
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:04,983
Manufactured in Houndsworth.

242
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:09,150
Why are you serving me
this rubbish?

243
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:12,483
Bard and the others purchased
quite a few of them.

244
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:14,317
How was the interview
this afternoon?

245
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,775
I only wish that you could
have been there, my lord...

246
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:18,692
Tanaka was
quite extraordinary.

247
00:16:18,775 --> 00:16:19,775
That's good...

248
00:16:19,858 --> 00:16:21,275
A distinguished
old man makes

249
00:16:21,358 --> 00:16:22,983
a suitable face
for the company.

250
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:24,525
Yes...

251
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,483
The interviewer deigned to take
a photograph before he left.

252
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:27,650
Did he?

253
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:29,525
Apparently portrait photos
are all the rage

254
00:16:29,608 --> 00:16:31,942
among the nobles lately.

255
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,358
Are they?

256
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:34,442
I know, young master...

257
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:36,567
why not try your hand
at it yourself?

258
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,733
No.

259
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:51,733
It's almost time...
Let's go.

260
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,192
Are you sure
this is okay?

261
00:17:00,275 --> 00:17:01,233
Yes.

262
00:17:01,317 --> 00:17:02,483
I don't know...

263
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:03,858
Do it, Finni!

264
00:17:03,942 --> 00:17:05,108
Right!

265
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,775
Look out, sir!

266
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:16,275
What a charming picture
the two of you make.

267
00:18:16,358 --> 00:18:17,733
You're late.

268
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:22,567
My apologies, sir...I was
making dinner preparations.

269
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,775
For the entrée
this evening,

270
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:26,483
we will have Canard
a la Rouennaise.

271
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:29,067
That's nice.

272
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,733
You could have just told me
to pose for a picture.

273
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:33,858
What?

274
00:18:33,942 --> 00:18:35,775
Had you ordered me to...

275
00:18:35,858 --> 00:18:38,317
I would have had
no choice but to do so.

276
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:45,525
I don't know
what you mean.

277
00:18:50,608 --> 00:18:52,233
We finally got
the photo.

278
00:18:52,317 --> 00:18:55,025
At last, we'll see the fruits
of a hard day's labor.

279
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:57,483
The young master will
be happy, yes he will!

280
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:10,400
Okay... I can
almost make it out.

281
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:15,692
Plu-Plu!

282
00:19:19,942 --> 00:19:22,108
What's wrong, Pluto?

283
00:19:32,275 --> 00:19:34,358
I wonder what all
the noise is about...

284
00:19:34,442 --> 00:19:36,067
Do you know, my lord?

285
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:52,608
Good.

286
00:20:02,275 --> 00:20:03,775
My lord has
outdone himself...

287
00:20:03,858 --> 00:20:07,358
That was an elaborate piece
of mischief he concocted.

288
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:09,858
You do know you're
sleeping outside?

289
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,400
Excuse me, lord... We
should prepare you for bed.

290
00:20:28,942 --> 00:20:31,650
Falling asleep slumped in
your desk chair...?

291
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:33,442
How irresponsible of you

292
00:20:36,692 --> 00:20:40,108
But typical, I suppose.

293
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:43,192
Once again you have given
me unnecessary work.

294
00:20:57,275 --> 00:20:58,108
Whoa.

295
00:20:58,192 --> 00:21:00,775
Sebastian's in the picture!

296
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:04,317
That means the young master
cares most about Sebastian...!

297
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,900
That is how Tanaka said
the camera works, right?

298
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:08,733
Interesting.

299
00:21:08,817 --> 00:21:10,525
Aw, they're
good friends!

300
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:13,983
That makes the master my
rival... What do I do?

301
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:15,692
Hey, it's Plu-Plu!

302
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:19,442
Huh...?! Hold on just a
second... That means...

303
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:21,442
Does this mean Sebastian's
in the picture

304
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:23,233
because the one who cares
the most about him

305
00:21:23,317 --> 00:21:24,483
is Pluto?

306
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:25,900
I don't know!

307
00:21:25,983 --> 00:21:28,650
Or is it the young master
like we thought at first?

308
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:30,275
Which one?!

309
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,025
I'm honored, master.

310
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:36,150
Oh, shut up.

311
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:37,608
It's your own fault
for falling asleep

312
00:21:37,692 --> 00:21:39,525
so defenselessly like that.

313
00:21:39,608 --> 00:21:41,608
How dare you!

314
00:21:41,692 --> 00:21:45,775
The image in a photograph isn't
real... only an illusion...

315
00:21:45,858 --> 00:21:48,983
But... that is
humanity's way...

316
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:50,900
seeking vainly to preserve
the image...

317
00:21:50,983 --> 00:21:54,483
because you fear one day
it may be forgotten.

318
00:22:05,817 --> 00:22:07,150
Hold on a second...

319
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:09,067
I thought the images the
Talbot camera showed...

320
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,775
were only of things
like my dead bird.

321
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,650
Weird... If that's true,

322
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:19,900
then why is Sebastian in
the photograph...? huh...

323
00:22:19,983 --> 00:22:20,942
Finni!

324
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:27,650
Plu Plu!

325
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,650
Well...who cares?

326
00:24:10,858 --> 00:24:12,983
The season has arrived
for the annual frost fair

327
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:15,067
on the River Thames.

328
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,150
My master claims to be
'inspecting the market,'

329
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:23,150
...But in truth, I know he is
enjoying himself immensely...

330
00:24:23,233 --> 00:24:25,525
Watching his innocent,
childish joy makes my heart

331
00:24:25,608 --> 00:24:27,608
feel positively tepid...

332
00:24:27,692 --> 00:24:30,983
No, wait, warm...
I mean warm.

333
00:24:31,067 --> 00:24:33,817
Next time on
Black Butler:

334
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,567
"His Butler, On Ice."

335
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:39,608
You see, I am simply
on hell of a butler.
