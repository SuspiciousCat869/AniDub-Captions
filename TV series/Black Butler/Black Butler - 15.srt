1
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:27,483
My word...!
Our gracious queen...

2
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:29,817
Her Majesty, and
mother of England...

3
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,025
Queen Victoria!

4
00:00:35,442 --> 00:00:37,233
It's her.

5
00:00:37,817 --> 00:00:40,400
I can't believe
she really came.

6
00:00:40,483 --> 00:00:42,233
She's much smaller than before.

7
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:48,483
God save our
gracious Queen

8
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:57,358
Long live our noble
Queen God save the Queen!

9
00:00:57,442 --> 00:01:07,150
Send her victorious
Happy and glorious

10
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:16,775
Long to reign over us,
God save the Queen!

11
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,983
Her Majesty bids me
tell you:...

12
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:29,233
I am so sorry
I have been unable

13
00:01:29,317 --> 00:01:30,858
to appear before you.

14
00:01:30,942 --> 00:01:33,358
However, I am now in
such perfect health that

15
00:01:33,442 --> 00:01:36,150
I may even enjoy curry again.

16
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:40,483
My late husband was exceedingly
fond of curry as well...

17
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,983
I look forward to your food.

18
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:49,942
And with that...
A la cuisine!

19
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:32,858
So it is started.

20
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:37,358
How stupid are you?!

21
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,067
Prince Soma... you are my god.

22
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,858
For you I will use my power.

23
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:52,817
By Jove...!

24
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,400
It's like that man's hand has
a mind of its very own!

25
00:03:55,483 --> 00:03:57,275
And it smells wonderful!

26
00:03:57,358 --> 00:04:01,233
HA! I paid for this...
"The hand of Kali."...

27
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:03,483
With him, I'm sure to win.

28
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,067
Funtom's not doing badly!

29
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,858
And it smells amazing!

30
00:04:13,108 --> 00:04:16,650
I say, what is he doing?

31
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:18,567
Hold on what is he--?

32
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:21,733
...it's chocolate?!

33
00:04:21,817 --> 00:04:23,483
Chocolate in curry?

34
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:25,192
What is he thinking?

35
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:26,567
Revolting!

36
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,358
A kid's company, of course
they'd use chocolate...!

37
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:32,650
Just a bid for publicity!

38
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,525
He is wrong...!

39
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,900
That is a
legitimate ingredient.

40
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:41,650
Blending cacao in provides
aroma and bitterness

41
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:44,650
and gives it a mellow,
full-bodied flavor.

42
00:04:48,692 --> 00:04:51,025
Where did you get
an idea like that...?

43
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:53,317
you're an Englishman,
are you not?

44
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,317
It was an order
from my master.

45
00:04:57,525 --> 00:05:00,442
Drop it in the curry
or something.

46
00:05:00,525 --> 00:05:02,150
I do his bidding...

47
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:05,150
no matter how reckless his
orders may seem to be...

48
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:08,108
You see, I'm simply
one hell of a butler.

49
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:11,108
What an interesting choice.

50
00:05:11,192 --> 00:05:14,150
Damn... What the hell
is he doing?

51
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,192
Such a bond between
servant and master.

52
00:05:27,817 --> 00:05:29,192
My prince...

53
00:05:29,275 --> 00:05:32,317
I knew you would not
forgive me for this.

54
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,608
But that's exactly why I can
not lose... It is time.

55
00:05:37,692 --> 00:05:39,275
What's that?!

56
00:05:39,358 --> 00:05:40,817
A blue lobster?!

57
00:05:41,358 --> 00:05:43,108
Homard bleu!

58
00:05:43,192 --> 00:05:46,150
It's the legendary blue lobster
said to exist only in

59
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:48,025
the seas of Brittany...!

60
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:50,317
Its beautiful blue shell
wraps around it

61
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,775
like a dress wraps
around a woman!

62
00:05:52,858 --> 00:05:55,358
So perfect! So magnificent!

63
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:58,192
And its flavor is
simply exquisite...!

64
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,192
The sweetness of the
blue lobster has been known

65
00:06:00,275 --> 00:06:02,317
to paralyze men before.

66
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,192
Exactly...! You can't just
add anything to curry...!

67
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:09,317
You see, mine is the truly
sophisticated recipe.

68
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,692
Whatever happens,
I shall defeat you...!

69
00:06:11,775 --> 00:06:15,108
Prepare for me...I have
the hand of a goddess!

70
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:30,067
Time up! And now
for the judging.

71
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,358
First we have
Parson Tubb's beef curry!

72
00:06:34,442 --> 00:06:36,483
The beef is thickly
cut and served

73
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:39,817
in generous portions...
I say, not a bad recipe.

74
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,900
But the dullness of the
flavor makes this a disgrace!

75
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:47,358
A professional chef
using curry powder?!

76
00:06:51,608 --> 00:06:54,400
I assume that your company
blends its own spices, correct?

77
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:55,983
Oh... yes!

78
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:57,400
Interesting...

79
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,400
There's one particular scent
in here that I like.

80
00:07:02,192 --> 00:07:04,608
But, if that particular
scent stands out...

81
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:07,608
that means the whole dish
is out of balance.

82
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:10,150
Well, we can give them
credit for trying.

83
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:13,650
Next, Harold West and Company!

84
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,733
I am happy to
present my curry.

85
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:19,483
Seven types of curry
with blue lobster.

86
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:21,775
So vividly colorful!

87
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:26,608
De... licious...!
Perfect sweetness...

88
00:07:26,692 --> 00:07:29,900
And the texture's like butter
melting on your tongue.

89
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,317
On top of that,

90
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,067
he's given us seven different
varieties of curry!

91
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:39,067
This is you...!
The beautiful woman I met

92
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,108
at the ball that night...!

93
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:43,233
The seven jewels that
adorned your neck...!

94
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:47,233
The gold brooch...!
The perfectly matching bracelet.

95
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:49,108
all pearls and sapphire...!

96
00:07:49,192 --> 00:07:52,233
The garnet choker,
the lovely cameo!

97
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:55,067
And on your finger, a ring
of diamonds and emeralds.

98
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,983
All showing off
your natural beauty...

99
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:03,150
My love...! You stole
my heart right then!

100
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,650
Extraordinary praise...!

101
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:10,650
Perhaps his victory
has been assured!

102
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:13,608
But we have one more
competitor left to go...!

103
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:16,108
From the Funtom Company...!

104
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,942
I hope you enjoy
what I have to offer.

105
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:24,608
Th...that's curry?!

106
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:31,567
No...! Just what are you
playing at?

107
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,942
No...! Frying?!

108
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:40,858
What are you doing, Sebastian?
We aren't making doughnuts here!

109
00:08:40,942 --> 00:08:44,817
They're all ready now...
This is Funtom Company curry.

110
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,692
Odd. I don't see any curry.

111
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:49,192
Hold on a moment... Look at it!

112
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,067
What's that?!

113
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,692
Curry on the inside!

114
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,775
What?!

115
00:08:58,858 --> 00:09:01,983
The Funtom Company present
our special brand of curry...

116
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:05,525
Behold... the Curry Bun!

117
00:09:06,483 --> 00:09:08,692
A... curry bun?

118
00:09:13,317 --> 00:09:16,608
Oh, dear me!
This is wonderful...!

119
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:19,858
The bread covering the curry
is crunchy, yet fluffy,

120
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:23,317
giving the dish incredible
gradients of texture!

121
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,525
What's even more amazing
is the structure,

122
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:27,942
which traps in all
the flavor of the curry...!

123
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,358
Cut it open,
and it's all there!

124
00:09:30,775 --> 00:09:37,692
You are the lovely young
maiden I met at a soiree...

125
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:41,025
By day you appear to be
but a twittering robin...

126
00:09:41,108 --> 00:09:44,650
But then night falls and
I see your beautiful face...

127
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:49,608
your true face...
I want you badly...

128
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:52,192
I want to embrace you, my love!

129
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:58,942
Yet another
rave review...!

130
00:09:59,025 --> 00:10:01,983
Everyone, I think we really
do have a contest here!

131
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:05,150
Sebastian, tell me...
are you a...?

132
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,608
The judges will now need
a little bit of time

133
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:12,900
for deliberation...

134
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:14,400
and in the meantime
the guests can

135
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:16,567
enjoy any curry they like!

136
00:10:22,942 --> 00:10:25,275
I notice Her Majesty
has eaten nothing...

137
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,525
She isn't one
of the judges?

138
00:10:27,608 --> 00:10:29,442
I'm sure she's avoiding
the curry because of

139
00:10:29,525 --> 00:10:31,108
her fragile health...

140
00:10:31,192 --> 00:10:34,567
but maybe she'll try those
in top contention.

141
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,275
Of course,
her decision is sure to

142
00:10:36,358 --> 00:10:38,442
influence the judges.

143
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:40,692
The queen ultimately
decides who gets

144
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:42,400
the Royal Warrant.

145
00:10:55,733 --> 00:11:00,692
I'm certain that we'll win...
Our curry is the most popular.

146
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:04,817
It isn't certain yet...
Sebastian was quite inventive.

147
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:11,400
I'm sure there's
no need to worry...

148
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:16,108
Right... My darling?

149
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:18,483
Mina...! What are
you doing here...?

150
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:19,983
What if His Highness
should see you?

151
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:21,692
He already has.

152
00:11:21,775 --> 00:11:24,400
He's seen you...! Did you...?

153
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,692
Agni... You knew about her...

154
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:37,567
so you tried to keep
me from seeing her again.

155
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,733
What are you doing?

156
00:11:39,817 --> 00:11:42,608
You are aware that your butler
is competing up there...

157
00:11:42,692 --> 00:11:45,275
Are you not going
to support him?

158
00:11:45,358 --> 00:11:48,275
I know... but
I've been thinking...

159
00:11:48,358 --> 00:11:52,775
I have been so ignorant. I
never even tried to understand

160
00:11:52,858 --> 00:11:56,650
how Mina always felt...
how Agni must still feel...

161
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,692
If you can see that much,

162
00:11:58,775 --> 00:12:00,858
then what are you
doing standing here?

163
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,108
He has fought for you...

164
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:05,775
How many times
has it been now?

165
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,525
Butler or not, you owe
him something for that.

166
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:10,067
Wait. Ciel...

167
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:16,317
Oh look, there he is!
Your Highness, we're here!

168
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,567
The tasting's started,
yes it has.

169
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,067
You should really hurry or
else you're gonna miss it.

170
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,567
Here, try.

171
00:12:25,317 --> 00:12:26,733
So good!

172
00:12:26,817 --> 00:12:29,775
Your khansama's an
amazing chef, indeed...

173
00:12:29,858 --> 00:12:32,358
These buns are spectacular!

174
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,567
How could you
do that to him...?!

175
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,942
The prince cared
so much for you...

176
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,192
and you seemed to care
for him as well!

177
00:12:41,275 --> 00:12:44,567
A man like you would
never understand...

178
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,983
A Brahmin who left his
privileged station...

179
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,150
to become the servant
of some little brat?!

180
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:52,525
Then why did I do this...?
and what does it mean?!

181
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:54,900
How should I know
why you did it?

182
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:59,733
I have to... How else
will I do anything?.

183
00:12:59,817 --> 00:13:03,025
They used me,
now I'll use them.

184
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:20,067
You're the Funtom
chef, Sebastian...

185
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,608
The Queen desires a curry bun.

186
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:25,358
Would you be so kind
as to bring one here?

187
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:32,775
Here you are... your majesty.

188
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,817
The queen says...

189
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,317
"You have created
something a child could eat

190
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,358
without the use of
a knife or a fork.

191
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:54,317
In doing so,
you have reinforced

192
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,400
a necessary equality between
our nation's children

193
00:13:57,483 --> 00:14:01,025
and its adults...
For that I thank you."

194
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:05,400
Well done. You have contributed
to our great country, sir.

195
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:07,817
Her Majesty is
truly appreciative.

196
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,150
Don't make me laugh!

197
00:14:10,233 --> 00:14:14,025
How you flatter yourself...!
Equality? The future?

198
00:14:14,108 --> 00:14:16,567
Easy prospects for the queen
of a rich country

199
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,650
to speculate on...!
But what do you even know?!

200
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:24,608
Mina! What are you doing?!
You're in front of Her Majesty!

201
00:14:24,692 --> 00:14:25,567
Move!

202
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:30,150
Restrain her!

203
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:33,358
Oh, shut up
you don't know curry!

204
00:14:33,442 --> 00:14:35,525
It's a caste marker!

205
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:42,525
Her legs move with such
grace! Her hips are amazing!

206
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:46,567
I'm sure this woman is the
goddess Kali personified!

207
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:55,900
The Queen!

208
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:05,108
That smell... That's hatred.

209
00:15:05,192 --> 00:15:10,275
Hatred and greed!
The stench of the impure!

210
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:13,358
Snuff it out... Kill him.

211
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:19,442
Well what do you know
about that my lord?

212
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:20,942
It seems Kali has risen.

213
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:27,358
If the story is correct, Kali
carried around a demon's head.

214
00:15:27,442 --> 00:15:30,358
What say you...? Shall we
disprove the legend then...?

215
00:15:30,442 --> 00:15:32,983
I order you to stop Kali!

216
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:34,942
Indeed... my young lord

217
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:37,650
What happened here?

218
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:40,442
It was some insane Indian
woman...! She has gone berserk!

219
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:41,900
What?

220
00:15:45,317 --> 00:15:46,733
What's happening?!

221
00:15:51,608 --> 00:15:55,733
I'll admit it... You're
skilled. But you're no goddess.

222
00:15:55,817 --> 00:15:57,233
Mina, no...

223
00:15:57,317 --> 00:15:58,192
My prince!

224
00:15:58,275 --> 00:15:59,775
Agni...

225
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:03,192
You all know nothing... I was
trained in France, damn it...!

226
00:16:03,275 --> 00:16:06,192
None of you know
anything about curry!

227
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:07,192
Pardon me.

228
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:10,025
Tell me...
What is going on here?

229
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:11,817
I am not sure...

230
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,483
Mina and some of the others ate
a bit of the curry and suddenly,

231
00:16:20,275 --> 00:16:24,442
This is Kali Ma! My father
once told me about it...

232
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:28,567
This is a forbidden spice...
It reacts to the dark desires

233
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:32,817
within the human heart...
It makes us into monsters.

234
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:36,233
I'm sorry, Mina...

235
00:16:36,317 --> 00:16:39,067
I never knew your heart
was so wounded.

236
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:42,358
This is not your fault...

237
00:16:42,442 --> 00:16:45,150
She's possessed by the
evil spice, my prince.

238
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:48,525
I know that... You don't
need to say anymore.

239
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:51,650
I have blamed everyone...
except myself...

240
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:55,192
All my loneliness... and then
Mina leaving me, too...!

241
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:58,567
Such a spoiled brat, why
should anyone love me?

242
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,067
But you... you were
always there,

243
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,275
even when I couldn't
have deserved it.

244
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:08,608
I'm sorry I haven't said it...
Please forgive me...

245
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:12,650
And tell me... will you
still be there for me?

246
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:14,400
My prince...

247
00:17:18,525 --> 00:17:20,692
Mina's wrong... Stop her!

248
00:17:20,775 --> 00:17:24,275
Yes, As you wish!

249
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:27,608
I have never known this
happiness in my life before.

250
00:17:27,692 --> 00:17:31,525
Finally.... I am
one with my god!

251
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:37,733
I shall assist you.

252
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:38,983
Shall you...?

253
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:40,775
You seem to have more
energy than normal...

254
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:42,650
Did something happen?

255
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:46,567
Yes... and now...
I'm invincible.

256
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,692
Very well... The two
on the right are yours.

257
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:51,942
Good!

258
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:58,900
You have a fine butler...

259
00:17:58,983 --> 00:18:01,650
I doubt he will need
my help in this fight.

260
00:18:02,983 --> 00:18:05,692
A bit strange though,
isn't it...?

261
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:08,400
This is all because
of some spice.

262
00:18:08,483 --> 00:18:10,775
But only certain
people are affected...

263
00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:14,983
If it's that evil...
wouldn't more people go insane?

264
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:16,775
Really, if you think about it.

265
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:18,942
in this world there is
no one who can claim to be

266
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:20,942
truly pure of heart.

267
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:35,192
No, wait, Mina!

268
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:36,400
No, you fool!

269
00:18:37,608 --> 00:18:40,608
This is the only way
to stop Kali.

270
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:41,817
Come on, Mina!

271
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:46,483
Prince Soma!

272
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:49,525
Mina... forgive me!

273
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,692
Sebastian...the curry buns!

274
00:18:55,775 --> 00:18:57,817
Feed them some of
the buns you made!

275
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,150
Certainly.

276
00:19:01,483 --> 00:19:05,567
Curry cooked by a demon...
And it makes people happy...

277
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,900
What an utter joke...
and how utterly like him...

278
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:13,108
But if he chose to infuse
his dish with kindness

279
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:17,025
and happiness...
that's what they will get.

280
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:19,192
Madam!

281
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,567
What...? What's happening?!

282
00:19:32,025 --> 00:19:33,817
M... Mina?

283
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,483
Prince Soma...
I was completely right...

284
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,608
You are awful.

285
00:19:41,858 --> 00:19:43,858
The queen bids me tell you...

286
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:46,400
"The goodness of your
curry buns has defeated

287
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:48,358
the evil of the
demon spice and healed

288
00:19:48,442 --> 00:19:51,650
those who it had
afflicted... and therefore,

289
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,358
the winner of the Royal
Warrant has been decided."

290
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:06,067
How are you going
to handle them?

291
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,692
They won't be treated badly.

292
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:12,567
Thank you... You have
done very well today...

293
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,358
I congratulate you
on your success in

294
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:16,358
obtaining a
Royal Warrant...

295
00:20:16,442 --> 00:20:20,192
Her Majesty has expressed
her gratitude toward you.

296
00:20:20,275 --> 00:20:24,150
She bids me tell you: "I'm
sorry for your hardship...

297
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:26,900
but know I have been
watching your work closely...

298
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:30,567
I am in the light... as you
are in the shadows...

299
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,108
Though our positions
are different,

300
00:20:32,192 --> 00:20:34,192
we strive for
the same thing"...

301
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,692
I ask that you please
continue to aid Her Majesty.

302
00:20:38,942 --> 00:20:40,067
Yes.

303
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:43,525
Then I bid you farewell.

304
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:51,858
I have to thank you too, Ciel.
What if I had never met you...?

305
00:20:51,942 --> 00:20:53,567
I would be as selfish
and ignorant

306
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,067
as I've always been.

307
00:20:56,275 --> 00:20:59,400
There are still so many things
that I have to learn...

308
00:20:59,483 --> 00:21:02,400
All of England...
No... all of the world

309
00:21:02,483 --> 00:21:06,317
has much to teach me,
and I am a willing student.

310
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,067
And thank you...

311
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,275
Your household has taught
the prince and me

312
00:21:10,358 --> 00:21:11,900
a great many things...

313
00:21:11,983 --> 00:21:14,275
What would we have
done without you?

314
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:16,317
Please, lift up your head...

315
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,150
I had my own reasons
for my actions...

316
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:22,775
You have absolutely
no reason to be thanking me.

317
00:21:22,858 --> 00:21:25,900
The gods you believe
in are Kali and Shiva...

318
00:21:25,983 --> 00:21:27,858
They were able
to realize their mistakes

319
00:21:27,942 --> 00:21:31,067
through mutual pain...
Just like you and Soma.

320
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,650
You see... the old adage
is true: without pain,

321
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:37,483
we can never truly
hope for growth.

322
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:41,233
I've relearned my gods'
teachings from an Englishman...

323
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:43,942
That is quite embarrassing.

324
00:21:44,025 --> 00:21:46,275
Nationality is irrelevant...

325
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:49,900
All places and all times
are essentially the same.

326
00:21:49,983 --> 00:21:52,858
Human nature
is a static thing.

327
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:54,317
Yes, I understand...

328
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,108
It is just as how the sunsets
over the Ganges River

329
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:59,817
and the Thames
are equally beautiful.

330
00:22:11,983 --> 00:22:16,358
Mina! My Mina
left me! For good!

331
00:22:16,442 --> 00:22:19,358
Let me go!

332
00:22:19,442 --> 00:22:22,025
I am very glad that
we came to England...

333
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:22,650
My prince and I both made
friends ideally suited to us.

334
00:22:22,733 --> 00:22:26,317
Mina...

335
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,733
A friend...?
Interesting...

336
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:32,067
No one has ever referred
to me as that...

337
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,525
You sir are the first.

338
00:22:33,608 --> 00:22:36,567
Go find a handkerchief!

339
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,775
Master... Are you
certain about this...?

340
00:24:14,858 --> 00:24:18,108
You don't mind me waiting
on other masters?

341
00:24:18,192 --> 00:24:20,233
You'll have to change
your own clothes...

342
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:24,108
and remember to brush
your back teeth.

343
00:24:24,192 --> 00:24:25,775
And for that matter brush
your own hair, and--...

344
00:24:25,858 --> 00:24:28,525
Oh my, what ever shall
you do without me...?

345
00:24:28,608 --> 00:24:31,025
No tantrums now!

346
00:24:31,108 --> 00:24:33,358
Next time,
on Black Butler...

347
00:24:33,442 --> 00:24:36,233
"His Butler,
in an Isolated Castle."

348
00:24:36,317 --> 00:24:38,275
You see, I'm simply
one hell of a butler.
