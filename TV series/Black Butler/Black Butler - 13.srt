1
00:00:18,483 --> 00:00:20,942
This is gorgeous.

2
00:00:21,025 --> 00:00:24,150
It is so cold...
Agni... what is this?

3
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,275
This substance is
called snow, my prince.

4
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:28,400
It falls during
the winter in England.

5
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:29,983
How odd.

6
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:35,150
So this is England...
It is beautiful.

7
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,233
"This fellow is the child
of craziness and laziness...

8
00:02:18,317 --> 00:02:21,150
England is the blasphemous
country that has taken all,

9
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:23,358
and forced on us
in arrogant ways,

10
00:02:23,442 --> 00:02:24,858
it's rotten culture.

11
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:27,525
Retribution should befall
the fools of the country

12
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:29,733
that the hellcat rules."

13
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:32,275
This makes
twenty victims so far...!

14
00:02:32,358 --> 00:02:35,483
And you still haven't caught
this criminal...?! Explain!

15
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:38,025
I haven't and I'm sorry,
Sir Arthur.

16
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:40,817
When Jack the Ripper
slipped through our hands...

17
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,650
that brat got
all the credit.

18
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:45,483
Brat, sir?
Who do you mean?

19
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:47,525
You're speaking of
Ciel Phantomhive?

20
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,150
You know... I can't help
but feel that he's

21
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:53,692
carrying some immense
burden on his shoulders...

22
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:56,358
and he's still only a child.

23
00:02:57,442 --> 00:02:58,525
A child?

24
00:02:58,608 --> 00:03:01,025
So all the victims had
just returned home

25
00:03:01,108 --> 00:03:01,567
from India, then?

26
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,858
Oh, you're here!

27
00:03:03,942 --> 00:03:06,442
But the culprit hasn't
killed anyone yet.

28
00:03:07,942 --> 00:03:11,192
"The child of craziness
and laziness..."

29
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:13,817
This man does have a way
with words, doesn't he...?

30
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,858
I agree our country would
benefit if all these

31
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:18,983
nouveaux riche fresh from
India disappeared...

32
00:03:20,275 --> 00:03:22,567
Still... I don't
like this mark.

33
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,817
With this, he's mocking the
queen and all Englishmen,

34
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,150
too...! He's Indian.
I'm certain of it!

35
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:33,150
I imagine that would be the
reason I was called in.

36
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:35,692
Most of the Indians
who've come here illegally

37
00:03:35,775 --> 00:03:37,317
are staying in the
criminal neighborhoods

38
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,817
of the East End...

39
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,567
and Scotland Yard still doesn't
know their exact number

40
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,275
or their precise
location, does it?

41
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:48,233
I cannot allow Her Majesty
to continue suffering

42
00:03:48,317 --> 00:03:52,233
such an indignation...
Sebastian, let's go.

43
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:53,650
Sir.

44
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,025
I believe this area
is where the bulk of

45
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:05,317
the Indians have settled.

46
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
Yes.

47
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:10,608
That hurt! You fiend!

48
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:13,942
I've cracked a rib.
I might die from this!

49
00:04:14,025 --> 00:04:15,400
Oi! What happened?

50
00:04:15,483 --> 00:04:17,983
What a terrible injury! He
should pay you back for it!

51
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:20,733
Yes, give us
all your money, brat.

52
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:23,608
What a cliché bunch
of thugs we've run into...

53
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:25,942
Master... shall I handle this?

54
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:27,775
Yes, but make it quick.

55
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:28,817
Certainly.

56
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,692
Listen boy,
you are outnumbered.

57
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:32,233
Everybody within
a mile of here

58
00:04:32,317 --> 00:04:34,150
hates you English dogs!

59
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:38,442
Did he hurt you at all,
young master?

60
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:40,233
He did not.

61
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:41,608
Damned brat!

62
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:44,150
You take over our country,
drag us here,

63
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:46,025
and then throw us away
like garbage!

64
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:47,858
Your people have
tracked your filth

65
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:49,108
all over our homeland!

66
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:51,108
How about we show
you the humiliation

67
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:52,358
of being robbed, eh?

68
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:56,192
Excuse me! I'm looking
for this Indian woman...

69
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:58,983
Perhaps you gentlemen have
seen her around here?

70
00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:03,817
Who the hell're you...?!
Just stay out of this!

71
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,567
Oh my... Are you fellows
having a duel?

72
00:05:07,817 --> 00:05:09,608
He has a khansama with him...

73
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:12,233
Are you an
English nobleman?

74
00:05:12,317 --> 00:05:13,942
What if I say I am?

75
00:05:14,025 --> 00:05:16,067
Then I will have no choice...

76
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,942
I must side with my
countrymen... Come Agni!

77
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:19,692
Yes, sir?

78
00:05:19,775 --> 00:05:21,442
Defeat the Englishmen.

79
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:23,067
As you wish.

80
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,567
I shall use my
holy weapon...

81
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,733
Which I was given that I
might serve my master.

82
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:44,692
He's fast.

83
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:49,942
I have repeatedly struck many
of your vital pressure points.

84
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:52,942
Any normal person's arms would
have gone numb by now...

85
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:54,483
How are you moving?

86
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:57,442
We weren't doing anything but
walking down the street...!

87
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:59,150
Are you nothing more than
a reckless savage

88
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,692
who will attack anyone
who merely walks by you?

89
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:03,817
What...? Tell me, men...

90
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,817
did you attack this child
here for no good reason?

91
00:06:08,025 --> 00:06:12,650
Unfortunately... my countrymen
are wrong here... Agni...!

92
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:14,983
We are on the
Englishmen's side now.

93
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:16,150
Right.

94
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,150
It is done, Prince Soma.

95
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:23,942
Good.

96
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:26,400
Well... there's
someone I need to find,

97
00:06:26,483 --> 00:06:29,025
so I will be going
now... Good bye.

98
00:06:30,275 --> 00:06:32,858
These English streets
are like a labyrinth.

99
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:35,025
Let's take our next left.

100
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,108
Well that was a waste of time.

101
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:41,942
One of those men might be the
culprit we're looking for...

102
00:06:42,025 --> 00:06:44,442
Let us wait for
Sir Arthur to contact us.

103
00:06:46,192 --> 00:06:46,900
Master.

104
00:06:46,983 --> 00:06:48,400
Welcome home!

105
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:49,483
Hello!

106
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:51,442
I'll never get any
peace at this rate

107
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:54,317
if I'm called to London
for every silly little thing.

108
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,692
My lord, how good
it is to see you!

109
00:06:57,775 --> 00:06:59,108
What's he doing here?...

110
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:02,358
How many times have I told
you to send a note first?!

111
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:04,942
Well I haven't kept a tally.

112
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,608
Shall I bring
refreshment for our guest...?

113
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:08,942
Perhaps some tea my lord?

114
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:11,192
Oh dear, you might as well.

115
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:13,567
Perhaps chai
rather than Earl Grey?

116
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,233
Fine, whatever.

117
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,192
Wha-...?How...?

118
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:21,525
Oh, them...? I ran into them
on a street corner.

119
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,317
They said they wanted
to speak with you.

120
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,900
So you just come
barging in here?!

121
00:07:24,983 --> 00:07:27,733
Why, certainly... We're
acquaintances now...

122
00:07:27,817 --> 00:07:29,483
Surely you haven't
forgotten me.

123
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:31,025
We met during
a street brawl.

124
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:32,817
And if you'll recall,
I saved you.

125
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,983
"Saved me?!"...
Excuse you?!

126
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:37,317
Back home, if someone
does you a favor,

127
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,733
you offer them hospitality.
Is it British practice

128
00:07:40,817 --> 00:07:43,108
to leave your savior
out in the cold?

129
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:47,400
And just who the hell
do you think you are?!

130
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:50,692
Who am I? Why, I'm a prince.

131
00:07:50,775 --> 00:07:52,192
A prince?

132
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:54,650
This is the son of the king
of Bengal...

133
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:56,317
Please extend your
warmest welcome to

134
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,067
my master
Prince Soma Asman Kadar.

135
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,525
Thank you for your
hospitality... kid.

136
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:04,192
A real prince in our own
home! Amazing!

137
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,775
Ooh! How exciting!

138
00:08:05,858 --> 00:08:06,983
What an opportunity!

139
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:09,108
I've never seen a prince
up close before.

140
00:08:09,192 --> 00:08:11,567
You may approach...
I give you permission.

141
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,900
This "Pengal" place sounds
exotic. What's it like?

142
00:08:14,983 --> 00:08:17,192
A holy land blessed
by the goddess Kali

143
00:08:17,275 --> 00:08:19,317
and watered by the
Ganges River.

144
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,275
I see you brought
your servants into town

145
00:08:21,358 --> 00:08:22,483
with you this time.

146
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:24,483
Yes... We were able
to leave the guard dog

147
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:26,067
watching the mansion.

148
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,733
Ah... it should be
all right, then.

149
00:08:30,858 --> 00:08:34,650
Sebastian... don't let them out
of your sight for a moment.

150
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:35,858
Yes, sir.

151
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,317
It's time to wake up,
Lord Phantomhive.

152
00:08:42,608 --> 00:08:44,317
What's that...? Who's there?

153
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,358
Namaste ji...Good morning.

154
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:49,858
Wh-Why are you
in my room?!

155
00:08:49,942 --> 00:08:53,025
We're going out and about,
kid... Show us around town.

156
00:08:53,108 --> 00:08:56,400
Why should I do that...?! And
don't call me 'kid' anymore!

157
00:08:56,483 --> 00:08:58,150
I have a real name. It's Ciel!

158
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:01,483
All right, Ciel, I order you
to show me around...

159
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:02,650
Come.

160
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:04,858
Pardon me, prince.
I am terribly sorry...

161
00:09:04,942 --> 00:09:08,025
My master's day is full...
I'm afraid there's a great deal

162
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:10,608
of work and studying
he must attend to.

163
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:14,525
You will need a tutor
while we're in London...

164
00:09:14,608 --> 00:09:16,317
I shall fill that role.

165
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:21,483
Bach's Chaconne
in D minor...?

166
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:23,900
There's no way I can play
something this complex.

167
00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:26,608
As your tutor,
I make the rules.

168
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:27,900
Surely you have no objection

169
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:30,067
to my teaching
methods, master.

170
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:41,442
Well done. Very nice, my lord.

171
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:51,275
What are they doing?!

172
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:55,983
If I had to guess, I'd
say they're praying...

173
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:58,358
Quite an odd idol they
have, though, isn't it?

174
00:09:58,442 --> 00:10:00,400
It looks to me like
a statue of a woman

175
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:03,483
who seems to be carrying
a severed head...

176
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:05,525
She's wearing a necklace
of severed heads as well...

177
00:10:05,608 --> 00:10:08,650
and dancing on
a man's stomach.

178
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,733
It depicts one of the sacred
beings of Hinduism...

179
00:10:11,817 --> 00:10:13,317
she is the
goddess Kali.

180
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,108
A goddess of India?

181
00:10:15,192 --> 00:10:17,067
Kali is the wife
of the god Shiva.

182
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,358
She is also the goddess of
power... Here she is again...

183
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:23,817
according to our faith, a
demon once foolishly

184
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,025
challenged her...

185
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:28,025
Naturally, she was
victorious... However...

186
00:10:28,108 --> 00:10:30,650
her destructive urges
were not quelled...

187
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:33,733
She gave herself to
destruction and carnage.

188
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:37,317
But then... in order
to protect the Earth...

189
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,442
her husband Shiva threw
himself at his wife's feet.

190
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,067
Treading upon her husband
brought Kali back to

191
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:49,650
her senses... And peace was
again restored to the world.

192
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,733
The statue shows her story...

193
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,067
The goddess Kali
walking upon her husband...

194
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:58,400
and in her hand the head of
the vile demon that she slew.

195
00:10:58,483 --> 00:10:59,900
And there you have it.

196
00:10:59,983 --> 00:11:02,775
I've never heard of a goddess
with such power... I shall

197
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:05,483
have to keep that in mind
if I ever go back to India.

198
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:08,025
All right, then... We are
done praying now...

199
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:09,275
Let's go out!

200
00:11:09,358 --> 00:11:12,525
I'm too busy to go out.
I already told you that!

201
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:16,192
Honestly... when are you going
to be done with all this...

202
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,733
Yawn... What are you
even doing anyway...?

203
00:11:18,817 --> 00:11:20,483
You look like an idiot.

204
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:22,650
Be quiet. You're distracting!

205
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:24,775
Are all the English
this short-tempered?

206
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:28,275
You're never going
to shut up, are you...?!

207
00:11:28,358 --> 00:11:31,483
If you need attention so badly,
why not give fencing a try!

208
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:35,525
And if I win, you will go out
on the town with me?

209
00:11:35,608 --> 00:11:36,817
If you can beat me.

210
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,817
Good luck to you,
my prince.

211
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,900
Now, let the fight begin!

212
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:45,775
You're mine now!

213
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:48,650
Hey, what the--?

214
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:51,525
A strike like that will
accomplish nothing for you.

215
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:54,858
Wait, this isn't fair! I don't
know the rules like you do!

216
00:11:54,942 --> 00:11:58,733
Hey, a fight is a fight... It's
not my fault you don't know.

217
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:00,525
Highness, look out!

218
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,775
Sir...! I'm sorry...

219
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:11,358
When I saw the prince losing,
my reflexes took over.

220
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:12,775
Forgive me.

221
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:17,400
You protected your master
well, Augni...

222
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:18,983
So that's it, kid...

223
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:21,817
Augni is my servant,
an extension of myself...

224
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,775
Which means this
fight goes to me.

225
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:25,233
Wait...! That's not fair!

226
00:12:25,317 --> 00:12:28,400
How interesting.
Sebastian, it looks as if

227
00:12:28,483 --> 00:12:32,108
you'll have to avenge
your master... Here you go.

228
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:36,025
For goodness' sake...
Master, why ever did you

229
00:12:36,108 --> 00:12:38,733
have to provoke the
bratty little prince?

230
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:41,358
However, as the
Phantomhive butler,

231
00:12:41,442 --> 00:12:44,650
I cannot sit idly by while
somebody harms my master...

232
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:47,275
That would be an absolute
disgrace to my position...

233
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:50,400
Besides, we're a full ten
minutes behind schedule now.

234
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:52,983
The time...? That's
what you care about?

235
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:56,567
I'm curious... Very well,
I'll allow you to duel...

236
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,900
Fight him...

237
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,567
And in the name of Kali,
make sure you don't lose.

238
00:13:01,983 --> 00:13:05,358
Sebastian, I order you...
shut the brat's mouth now!

239
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:11,692
As you wish.

240
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:14,067
As you wish,
young master.

241
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:10,192
My, how lovely... it seems
the swords have broken.

242
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:12,150
That means it's a draw,
doesn't it?

243
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:15,275
That servant of yours is
indeed impressive, Ciel.

244
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:18,900
How is it a draw...?! He
was fighting Sebastian!

245
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:22,858
Agni is by far the best
fighter in my palace.

246
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:26,358
I've never met anyone who
could keep up with him before.

247
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:28,858
He was a match
for a demon!

248
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:33,775
What happened?

249
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:36,108
Agni is no ordinary
human, is he...?

250
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:37,400
Don't tell me he's another....

251
00:14:37,483 --> 00:14:39,150
Deadly efficient butler!

252
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:40,525
No, my lord...

253
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:42,817
He is deadly, but
he's human enough.

254
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,650
I see... but with as much
strength as he has...

255
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:50,067
Indeed... He could effortlessly
hang men upside down...

256
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,983
It would be
a simple task for him.

257
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:54,400
All right...!

258
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:56,233
Tonight I'm going to make
something really special!

259
00:14:56,317 --> 00:14:58,608
I'll take care of the
cooking tonight...

260
00:14:58,692 --> 00:15:01,233
You just stay out
of trouble.

261
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,067
I beg your pardon...?!

262
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,608
I was planning on makin'
something tasty for our guest.

263
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:07,358
Sebastian?

264
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:10,858
I was wondering if I could be
of any service to you.

265
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:12,817
I have it under control,
thank you.

266
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:16,400
Four hands can work much
more quickly than two...

267
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,317
Please, feel free
to ask me for anything.

268
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,317
In that case... perhaps I
wouldn't mind helping me...

269
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,067
a cottage pie and
some gooseberry sauce

270
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,525
is needed for
tonight's meal?

271
00:15:24,608 --> 00:15:26,025
Indeed.

272
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:28,108
Oi! Why are you
letting him do it?

273
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:29,567
I am the cook here,
you know...?!

274
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,692
Hey, did you hear me?!

275
00:15:30,775 --> 00:15:33,483
So much to do, so little time.

276
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:45,067
Excuse me... Chef?

277
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,900
"Chef?"...Really...?
Are you talking to me?

278
00:15:47,983 --> 00:15:49,067
Yes.

279
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,442
Uh-huh...
That's me...

280
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:54,442
I'm afraid I'm not accustomed
to English cooking...

281
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:56,192
Could I ask for
your assistance?

282
00:15:56,275 --> 00:15:59,650
You betcha. Just leave it
to the chef!

283
00:16:03,608 --> 00:16:05,858
Something smells good.
What's for supper?

284
00:16:05,942 --> 00:16:08,358
Young man...!
You're just in time...

285
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:10,858
Perhaps you can help us in
preparing the evening meal.

286
00:16:10,942 --> 00:16:12,858
What...? Me, really...?

287
00:16:12,942 --> 00:16:15,233
But Sebastian says I don't
know my own strength,

288
00:16:15,317 --> 00:16:16,983
so I'm not allowed to
touch dishes and stuff

289
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:18,483
in the kitchen
because they'll break.

290
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:21,233
You're strong, huh...?
That's excellent...

291
00:16:21,317 --> 00:16:23,442
We need to mash and then
puree these potatoes,

292
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,733
but that involves a lot
of manual labor.

293
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:28,192
Even I should be able to
handle that much...!

294
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:30,983
I want to help with
supper! Please let me!

295
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,692
Look out!

296
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,942
That was a nasty fall...
Are you all right?

297
00:16:42,025 --> 00:16:44,317
Uh... I'm fine, thank you!

298
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,942
Perhaps it would be best if
you were to take the plates

299
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:48,608
down one at a time.

300
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:50,817
Yes... I think you're right.

301
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,317
How is it coming along, Agni?

302
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:04,483
With everyone's help, I'm
sure it will be delicious.

303
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:10,525
How did you find ways for
this lot to help out...?

304
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:11,858
Simply incredible!

305
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:15,233
Everyone is born with his
or her own talent...

306
00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:19,358
We all have our own paths and
duties set out by the gods...

307
00:17:19,442 --> 00:17:21,650
As children of the Divine
Mother, we need only

308
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:23,317
listen and perform
our tasks.

309
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,650
You seem to be a man of
impeccable character, Agni.

310
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:29,775
Not at all. I am but a
student of the gods.

311
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:32,733
Indeed, I was a hopeless fool
before I met the prince...

312
00:17:32,817 --> 00:17:36,317
I owe Prince Soma more than
I can ever hope to repay.

313
00:17:37,108 --> 00:17:41,025
I hurt many people,
blasphemed against the gods,

314
00:17:41,108 --> 00:17:44,567
committed crime afta
crime... And then...

315
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,233
the day of my judgment
finally came.

316
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:51,525
I was alone and adrift
in the wold.

317
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:52,942
You there...!

318
00:17:53,025 --> 00:17:55,900
They say you're a man with
the strength of a beast...

319
00:17:55,983 --> 00:17:57,358
I'm intrigued.

320
00:18:03,942 --> 00:18:06,233
The man you were
is dead now...

321
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:08,358
You will be reborn
with a new name

322
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:09,775
and a new life!

323
00:18:09,858 --> 00:18:12,608
I had abandoned the gods
of my homeland...

324
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,650
I had forsaken everything.

325
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:17,650
Now... you are Agni.

326
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:20,567
He seemed a god to me.

327
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:23,650
That day... I saw in
him something divine...

328
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:27,317
To my sinner's soul, his
radiance was transcendent!

329
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,275
Careful. Your pot's
boiling over.

330
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,817
The prince Soma is my
sovereign and my god...

331
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,025
He took pity on me,
gave me new life.

332
00:18:35,108 --> 00:18:36,900
So I will protect him
with mine...

333
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:39,608
I will do anything
I can for my prince...

334
00:18:39,692 --> 00:18:42,650
My desire are that all of
his dreams to come true.

335
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:44,025
If you ask me,

336
00:18:44,108 --> 00:18:45,567
the gods are a bunch
of good-for-nothings

337
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,900
we should
leave behind.

338
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:48,483
Sorry? What was that?

339
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:51,358
Oh no... It was nothing.

340
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:58,358
How long do you intend
to stay here?

341
00:18:58,442 --> 00:19:00,525
We will leave when
our business is done.

342
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:03,358
That's right... You said you
were searching for someone.

343
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,733
And you, how long are
you intending to stay?

344
00:19:05,817 --> 00:19:07,442
Now my lord, play nice.

345
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:12,567
I am searching for a
woman... This is her: Mina.

346
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,233
She was a servant
at my palace.

347
00:19:14,317 --> 00:19:17,983
Well, Sebastian... do you
think you can find her?

348
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:21,983
Even I can't do much with
that... But I'll try.

349
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:24,817
So... tell me what is
this 'Mina' doing here?

350
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,692
I've known Mina
for my entire life...

351
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:29,567
She was basically
my nursemaid...

352
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,775
The only person who ever
really took care of me...

353
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:35,817
My mother and father barely
paid any attention to me...

354
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,025
It was a lonely life.

355
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:43,733
But I had Mina... She was
always there for me...

356
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:47,358
Then... a British nobleman
who had his eyes on her

357
00:19:47,442 --> 00:19:50,525
kidnapped her and took her
back to England with him!

358
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:52,525
In other words...
you're here to bring

359
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,858
this woman back
to India with you.

360
00:19:54,942 --> 00:19:56,025
That is right...

361
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:58,067
I will stop at nothing
to bring her back!

362
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,817
Seems like a lot of fuss
to make over a servant.

363
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,442
No, it isn't!

364
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,025
You can not
comprehend my despair

365
00:20:05,108 --> 00:20:07,067
at being
separated from her!

366
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,067
You don't underst--

367
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,733
No, I don't.

368
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,192
Something as trivial as that
causes you great despair?

369
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:17,275
You're right... I
don't understand it...

370
00:20:17,358 --> 00:20:19,483
and I don't care to.

371
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:25,942
There are some things
you can never get back...

372
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,567
no matter how hard
you struggle.

373
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,400
But maybe you're still too
young to understand that,

374
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,025
Prince Soma.

375
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,108
Too young... I'm old enough
to know what I want...

376
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:43,567
and I don't want
to be alone anymore!

377
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:47,733
Never... no matter
how hard you struggle.

378
00:20:57,192 --> 00:20:58,525
Good evening, Prince...

379
00:20:58,608 --> 00:21:00,775
Even you should know how
to play Old Maid.

380
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:05,358
I have finished all of my
work for the day...

381
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:08,025
We can play cards until
I'm ready retire.

382
00:21:10,025 --> 00:21:11,150
Really?

383
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:13,525
Please don't think it's for
your sake...

384
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:15,108
I'm only here because
I'm bored,

385
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:17,150
and I have
nothing better to do.

386
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:22,317
Very sorry, I already
have plans...

387
00:21:23,692 --> 00:21:27,733
Unlike you, I'm a busy man...
Come, Agni... we're going out.

388
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:29,608
Yes.

389
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:36,775
If you don't get the
proper amount of sleep,

390
00:21:36,858 --> 00:21:39,942
you'll never grow up,
kid... Good night!

391
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:48,942
Ah...! There you are, sir...
Excuse me, but may I ask...

392
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:50,692
What?!

393
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:52,692
No luck again today huh?

394
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:55,400
We'll search again
tomorrow, Highness.

395
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,942
So they're back?

396
00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:02,942
I have to say, those two
seem very suspicious to me.

397
00:22:03,025 --> 00:22:04,567
Yes, they are odd.

398
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,983
But I don't see how
the recent string

399
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:07,817
of crimes would
benefit them.

400
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,608
They don't seem to bear
much of a grudge

401
00:22:09,692 --> 00:22:11,733
over England's colonial rule.

402
00:22:12,775 --> 00:22:14,608
Anyway, if they
were involved,

403
00:22:14,692 --> 00:22:16,275
why would they
willingly cross my path

404
00:22:16,358 --> 00:22:18,108
without a second thought...?

405
00:22:18,192 --> 00:22:21,067
That's just begging
me to suspect them.

406
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,942
A good point, my lord...

407
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:25,567
Maybe they really are
just looking for someone.

408
00:22:26,317 --> 00:22:29,358
It's still too soon
to know that for sure.

409
00:22:34,942 --> 00:22:37,442
I was waiting for you
to make your move.

410
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:14,692
The true face of Agni
that no one knows...

411
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:16,692
No matter what reasons
he may have,

412
00:24:16,775 --> 00:24:18,692
hiding things from
his master makes him

413
00:24:18,775 --> 00:24:21,400
a terrible butler!

414
00:24:21,483 --> 00:24:24,067
I'm not hiding anything
behind a second face...

415
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:27,942
If you like, you can
peel it off and see...

416
00:24:28,025 --> 00:24:31,192
Here we go...

417
00:24:31,275 --> 00:24:32,192
Next time on Black Butler...

418
00:24:32,275 --> 00:24:34,608
"His Butler,
Supremely Talented."

419
00:24:34,692 --> 00:24:37,317
You see... I'm simply
one hell of a butler.
