[YUNA]
Hello, Fina? It's me.

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:26.568
I can hear you!
Wow, this is amazing!

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.945
It's crazy how the bear bone

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:30.739
lets us communicate
even if we're so far apart.

00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:33.534
[YUNA] It's a bear phone,
not a bone, silly.

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:34.701
Why are you so surprised?

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:36.537
We tested the phones
a bunch before I left.

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:38.664
Well, it's still exciting to me.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.708
Um, is everything all right
on your end of things?

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.751
[YUNA]
Yep.

00:00:42.793 --> 00:00:46.380
Oh, except I'm kind of in a
snowstorm, but it's no biggie.

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:48.423
[FINA]
Really? You must be freezing!

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:49.925
Please don't get
sick or anything.

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:51.301
Don't be such a worry wart.

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:53.595
I've got my awesome bear
equipment, remember?

00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:55.973
Plus, Kumayuru and Kumakyu
are traveling with me,

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:58.183
so we're all set.

00:00:58.225 --> 00:00:59.393
When you put all that together,

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:03.230
crossing this mountain is
bear‐ly even a challenge!

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:41.578
[FINA] Okay. Kumayuru!
Kumakyu! Come this way!

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.246
You can do it!

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:45.457
[BOTH]
Kuma!

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.126
Come to me!

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:51.296
Oh, awesome! I didn't know
you could change your size.

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:53.006
You're so small n' cute!

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:56.468
[FINA giggles]

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.720
[YUNA]
Oh, now I get it.

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:00.847
I was transported to this
world for the sole purpose

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.643
of witnessing
this adorable scene!

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:07.854
And it's all thanks to my
time in the Royal Capital.

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:11.233
I leveled up while I was there
and got some sweet new skills.

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:15.153
On top of that, I connected with
a lot of interesting people.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.655
I bought a ton of
rare ingredients

00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:17.781
and hired some new chefs

00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:21.535
so I could finally open a
restaurant like everyone wanted.

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:24.079
Awesome. Life in this
world is finally perfect.

00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:27.332
I've managed to obtain my
every single desire‐‐not!

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:28.750
[GROUP gasps]

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:32.170
It's just so unfair.
The capital let me down!

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.589
There was no rice,
or miso, or soy sauce.

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:37.718
I was at least thinking I'd find
some good seafood, but no luck!

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.637
They only had
lame freshwater fish.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.392
I want it.

00:03:45.434 --> 00:03:47.811
Tuna sashimi, fried shrimp,
mackerel soaked in miso,

00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:50.480
grilled saury, and
dried horse mackerel!

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:53.233
[FINA] What's wrong?
Is your tummy hurting?

00:03:53.275 --> 00:03:55.402
You're so sweet, Fina. I'm okay.

00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:57.404
My stomach doesn't hurt‐‐
it just feels sad.

00:03:57.446 --> 00:03:58.321
[FINA]
Hm?

00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:00.866
[YUNA]
Hm? That reminds me.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.284
Didn't we talk about the ocean

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.161
when you and Shuri
stayed the night?

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:06.580
Uh, yep.

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:07.748
Wait, that's it.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.667
This is the same problem
I had with the eggs before.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.127
If it's not being
sold around here,

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.380
then I just need to buy it
directly from the source!

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:17.966
I've got me a date with destiny.

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:23.555
[door opens, closes]

00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:25.056
[MILAINE]
A port town?

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.477
Yes, ma'am. Right here.

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:31.897
[YUNA] For real? No way!
It's super close to Crimonia!

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.565
The town's called Mileela.

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:36.818
And it has a prosperous fishing
industry, but that's about it.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.154
And does our city
ever trade with them?

00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:41.490
Oh, no, that's impossible.

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.283
Take a look at this.

00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:46.036
The Elezent mountains
block any trade routes.

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:46.870
They're hard to climb,

00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:49.164
so that's why we don't
interact with Mileela.

00:04:49.206 --> 00:04:52.250
And technically, they're not
even a part of this kingdom.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:55.170
To be honest, we only get
occasional information

00:04:55.212 --> 00:04:57.339
about them from other
traveling adventurers.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.966
Sounds like it's
completely isolated, then.

00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:02.636
[YUNA]
Even if it's a tough route,

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:04.262
I could probably do it
with my Bear Summons

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.556
and special equipment.

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:07.933
[MILAINE]
Seafood is a particularly

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.392
attractive trade item.

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:12.521
So naturally, we would be
happy to do business with them.

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:14.272
Wait, are you asking because...?

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:17.317
[YUNA] Mm‐hm. I was
thinking about going there.

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:19.236
[YUNA] Plus, if I set
up a transfer gate,

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:21.404
then I'd only need to
cross the mountains one time.

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:24.157
[MILAINE giggles]
It's just like with the eggs.

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:25.408
You act like it doesn't matter,

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.035
but you're
surprisingly proactive

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:28.245
when you wanna be, Yuna.

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:31.998
Of course, after all I do hail
from a country of foodies!

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.250
[MILAINE]
Huh?

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:34.084
[YUNA]
That's right!

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:36.711
Japanese people have been
food adventurers since forever,

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:40.340
with the ability to even make
poisonous fish taste delicious!

00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:42.300
No way is some
stupid, snowy mountain

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.970
gonna get in between me
and my beloved seafood!

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.137
[FINA]
Sorry, what?

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:48.098
Oh, nothing!
I'm sorry about that.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.599
Just thinking out loud.

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:52.352
Anyway, I promise you there's
nothing to worry about.

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:54.312
[FINA]
Yeah, that's true.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:57.482
It is you we're
talking about after all.

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:59.317
[KUMAYURU grunts]

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.403
[YUNA]
What's wrong, Kumayuru?

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:04.030
[YUNA gasps]
Wait, are those people?

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:04.990
Way out here?

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:05.824
[FINA]
Everything okay?

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:09.369
Uh, I'm sorry, but I'll
call you back later, 'kay?

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.127
Wow, we really can't
thank you enough.

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:18.044
My name's Damon,

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:20.630
and I'm a fisherman
from the city of Mileela.

00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:21.715
You fish, bro?

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:23.133
I'm his wife, Yuula.

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:25.760
We're grateful for
your help, Miss Yuna.

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:28.471
And I'm grateful
for your cute bears.

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:32.642
There have been a lot
of surprises today.

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:34.895
Starting with your
bears finding us.

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:36.104
And ending with you pulling

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:38.732
an entire house of
that tiny item bag.

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:40.442
[YUNA] I get that,
but I'd prefer not to

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.193
go into the
details of my skills.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:46.031
[DAMON] Of course, you saved our
lives and that's what matters.

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:47.532
So what were you
two doing in the

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:51.036
middle of the mountains
in the first place?

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:53.038
Well, we were trying
to travel to Crimonia

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:55.040
in order to buy some
food and supplies.

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.542
But we weren't prepared
for such terrible weather.

00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:00.211
You're saying you crossed
the mountains just to buy food?

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:01.713
But I thought
Mileela was known for

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:03.214
its thriving fishing industry.

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:06.051
We were... until
about a month ago.

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:07.677
You see, that's
when a giant kraken

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:09.137
appeared right outside the city.

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:10.013
Krakens.

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:12.515
That's what they call those big
squid monster things, right?

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:14.476
[DAMON] Yes, it's made
a nest near our coast

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:17.646
and attacks any boat that
dares to come anywhere near it.

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:20.357
Meaning none of our boats
can leave or return.

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:21.775
And since we can't fish,

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.902
we've been unable to
trade with nearby towns,

00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:26.363
and our city is facing
a terrible food shortage.

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:27.781
But why go through
the mountains?

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:30.617
Isn't there a safer coastal road
that you could take instead?

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:33.453
Yes, the kraken isn't
our only problem.

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:36.373
You see, a band of thieves
have blocked that route,

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:38.541
and they'll attack anyone
who tries to use it.

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:40.043
We can't even
escape our own town,

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:42.253
much less procure more food.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:43.463
We're desperate.

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:46.508
Then what about your
adventurers? Can't they fight?

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:49.552
[DAMON] We had some skilled
ones, but they left early on.

00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:52.555
And the few that
stayed behind, well...

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:55.892
[YUNA]
Could the kingdom help?

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:57.644
No, I suppose not.

00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:59.813
Milaine said they're
not part of the kingdom,

00:07:59.854 --> 00:08:01.648
so I doubt they'd use
their own tax money

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.692
to save anyone from Mileela.

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:05.819
Their land and sea
routes are blocked.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.029
The kingdom and
adventurers are a bust.

00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:09.447
This doesn't look good.

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:12.158
[sighs] Guess I'm out of luck.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.994
I was really hoping I would
get to eat some seafood

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:16.246
at the end of this trip.

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:18.915
Does that mean you'll
return to Crimonia?

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:20.959
Nah. I've already come this far,

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:23.962
so I might as well finish
the journey and go to Mileela.

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:27.048
[YUNA] Plus, I gotta
set up the transfer gate.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.341
[DAMON grunts]
All right.

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:30.176
If you're going to
continue on your quest,

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:32.137
then will you please
take us with you?

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:33.513
Huh?

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.600
[DAMON] Even if we do manage
to make it to Crimonia,

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:39.602
I highly doubt that we'll
make it back to Mileela

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:41.187
without any help.

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:42.480
[YUULA] And there's
no point in buying food

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:45.608
if we don't make it back alive
to see our children again.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.277
[DAMON]
We'll pay you for your trouble.

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:49.362
[YUNA]
No need, it's on the way.

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:53.825
[YUNA gasps]
The ocean!

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:56.453
It's so beautiful
and normal looking!

00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:58.788
[YUULA]
Yep, that's Mileela.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.511
[YUNA] Nobody's making comments
about how weird my clothes are?

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:15.930
Man, things must be bad here.

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:17.599
It's usually much busier.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.933
Like, before the kraken arrived,

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:20.977
there were food stalls
and shops galore.

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:25.523
Yeah, back when I could go out
and fish every single day.

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:27.859
[GUILDSMAN 10A] This is what
we have in stock for today!

00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:31.988
All right! Gimme
all your wolf meat!

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.949
I'd like three fish!
Actually, make it two.

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:38.620
Uh, please calm down!
I can only sell what we have.

00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:43.416
That's good, looks like
there's still food for sale.

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:46.711
Yes. A small group of local
fishermen and adventurers

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.755
have been sneaking around
the kraken and thieves

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:50.590
to gather as much
food as they're able.

00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:51.424
But...

00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:54.219
[TOWNSMAN 10A] You kidding?
Twenty silvers for just this?!

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.929
It's practically nothing!

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.472
What's with the price gouging?

00:09:57.514 --> 00:09:59.265
[GUILDSMAN 10A]
Sorry, it's not my decision.

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:00.058
Really?

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.727
That's over ten times what they
charge for meat in Crimonia.

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:04.729
No wonder everyone's
so frustrated.

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.147
That's a total rip off.

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:08.399
[ZARRAD] If that's how
you feel, then don't buy it!

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.985
You all know that there's not
much food available right now.

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:12.862
Yet you would dare put
a price on the lives

00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:16.950
of the people who risked their
safety to help feed everyone?

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:19.452
If you want my opinion,
20 silvers is nothing

00:10:19.494 --> 00:10:22.163
when those people are putting
their lives on the line.

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:23.706
If you don't like the prices.

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:26.251
Then feel free to go
do your own hunting!

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.711
[TOWNSPEOPLE mutter]

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:30.046
Who's that guy?

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:32.507
[YUULA] Oh, that's the guild
master of the merchant's guild.

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:35.510
Technically, he's in charge of
distributing the town's food.

00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:37.679
But he also sets
the prices for the food

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.264
that the adventurers collect.

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.515
Unfortunately, they're so high

00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:42.559
that hardly anyone
here can afford it.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.518
I mean, he's a merchant,

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.311
so I get that he
has to make a profit.

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:47.897
But I can also understand
why everyone's so angry.

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:51.651
Right. We either pay
the prices or starve.

00:10:55.864 --> 00:10:57.782
‐‐[BROTHER 10A] Father! Mother!
‐‐[SISTER 10A] Father! Mother!

00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:58.867
I tried to tell you it was

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:01.494
impossible to cross the
mountains on your own!

00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:03.329
You have no idea
how worried we were!

00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:04.539
Sorry, kids.

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:05.790
Please forgive us.

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:08.459
We weren't able to bring
you guys any food either.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:10.128
It's okay, Mother!

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.255
And honestly, I'm not
even that hungry right now!

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:13.214
[stomach rumbles]

00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:14.674
[SISTER 10A]
Really?

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:16.176
[BROTHER 10A]
Sorry, I can't help it.

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:18.761
C'mon, you have to
do better than that.

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:20.263
[BROTHER 10A]
I'm trying.

00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:21.681
I'm so sorry, children!

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:23.975
If I could, I'd let you both
eat until you were stuffed.

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:26.144
It's fine! I swear
I'm not hungry!

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.354
Same here! Besides, what's
the point of having food

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:31.399
if we can't enjoy it
with our parents?

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:33.651
[DAMON cries]
I'm sorry!

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:36.070
[GROUP cries]

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:41.284
[YUNA]
This again.

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:44.662
Guess I'm destined to always
find the people who need help.

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:47.207
[GROUP gasps]

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:49.792
[YUNA] That should do it.
If you want to thank me,

00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:51.920
just point me in the direction
of the adventurer's guild,

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:53.755
oh, and a good inn, too, please.

00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:15.693
[ATOLA] Well, well, what
a cute little bear you are.

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:20.990
Uh, sorry, is this
an adult establishment?

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:25.119
[ATOLA giggles] Nope, welcome
to the adventurer's guild.

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:27.330
I'm the guild
master here, Atola.

00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:29.582
Nice to meetcha,
little miss bear.

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:30.959
[YUNA]
Seriously?

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:32.752
Sorry to be the
bearer of bad news,

00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:36.923
but we're far too busy to accept
any new requests right now.

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:39.842
[sighs] Since when does
drinking count as being busy?

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:41.344
[ATOLA giggles]

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:43.596
[sighs]
You know what, forget it.

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:46.266
Look, I didn't come
here to put in a request.

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:48.893
I'd like to make a donation
of wolf meat to the town.

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:50.770
Wait, hold on. You hunt?

00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:53.398
Well, of course,
I'm an adventurer.

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:58.444
[laughs] How do you say
that with a straight face?

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.951
I'm sorry to laugh,

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:07.412
but you gotta admit
that's a pretty tall tale.

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:08.663
And I would know
if there was such

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:11.833
a cutely dressed
adventurer in this guild.

00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:13.334
Look lady,
I'm not from your guild;

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:15.837
I crossed the
mountains from Crimonia.

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:19.340
[gasps]

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:20.883
[ATOLA]
You're a real adventurer?

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:21.801
You serious?!

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:24.178
A child crossed the
mountains from Crimonia?

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.722
That's impossible!

00:13:25.763 --> 00:13:28.599
Uh, it's not impossible;
I did it.

00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:36.107
You've slayed a tiger wolf pack,

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:39.110
a goblin king,
and a black viper?

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:41.279
All of these quests
were done solo

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:45.116
and completed at 100 percent?!

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:49.704
We're honored to
have you! Welcome!

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:52.999
[YUNA] Wow. And just like that,
she's changed her whole tune.

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:55.585
Now then, you said you
wanted to donate some food?

00:13:55.626 --> 00:13:57.462
How sweet, that'd be a big help!

00:13:57.503 --> 00:13:59.922
All the guild members here
are doing the best they can,

00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:01.883
but in the end, we just
don't have enough people

00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:04.093
to help with collecting
food for everyone.

00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:06.471
So you weren't lying
about being busy, then?

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:08.806
We've been working with
the adventurers we do have.

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:10.183
We're investigating the thieves,

00:14:10.224 --> 00:14:11.684
researching ways
to kill the kraken,

00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:14.729
and contacting the guilds
in nearby towns for back up.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:16.397
I don't even have time to sleep.

00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:17.607
Yeah, somehow I don't think

00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:19.525
drinking alcohol is
gonna help with that.

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:21.402
[ATOLA chuckles]

00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:25.656
This is bitter tea
to keep me awake!

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:27.200
That's so misleading!

00:14:27.241 --> 00:14:28.868
Here I thought you were
some kinda weird lush,

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.495
but you're just
trying to stay awake?

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:33.247
So how much wolf meat
are you willing to donate?

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:36.334
Let's see. Would 5,000
wolves do the trick?

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:38.795
Oh, sure. Wait, 5,000?

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:40.505
Yeah, you got a good
place to store it all?

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:42.048
Uh, no, of course I don't!

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.759
No way we could handle
that many wolves at once.

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:47.261
[YUNA] Right. What about
a hundred wolves a day?

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:49.555
That works. But you sure, Yuna?

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:51.182
That means you'd
have to stay in Mileela

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:52.100
for quite some time.

00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:53.851
It's cool;
I promised I would help.

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:56.020
Guess you could say the
ship's already sailed.

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:59.190
[gasps, giggles]

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:00.566
Thanks so much, Yuna!

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:02.276
I'll be right back!

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:06.697
[ATOLA]
Hey, I could use some help!

00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:09.283
Someone came in
to donate a ton of food!

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:11.994
Rats, no one is back yet.

00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:14.497
In that case,
I'll harvest them myself.

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:17.333
Whether it's a hundred or a
thousand wolves, bring it on!

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:18.459
[cackles]

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:20.461
Things are about
to get even busier!

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:22.547
[cackles]

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:24.549
[YUNA]
You really should sleep.

00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:29.804
[ATOLA]
Thank you for waiting!

00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:32.890
We'll begin to distribute
the free wolf meat now!

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:35.518
[CROWD cheers]

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.978
[GUILDSMAN 10B]
There's no need to push!

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:39.063
We have more than
enough for everyone!

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:41.023
[TOWNSWOMAN 10B]
We can get this much?

00:15:41.065 --> 00:15:43.109
[TOWNSWOMAN 10C]
Thank you!

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:45.445
[TOWNSWOMAN 10D]
We're saved!

00:15:56.873 --> 00:15:58.833
[DEIGHA]
How 'bout it, Little Bear?

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:01.210
The food we make in our
inn is pretty tasty, eh?

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:02.837
[YUNA]
Mm‐hm. It's delicious!

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:05.715
I'll have to thank Mister Damon
for recommending you to me.

00:16:05.756 --> 00:16:07.925
Thank the adventurer's
guild, too.

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.260
We're extremely fortunate

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:11.345
that they distributed
free food to everybody.

00:16:11.387 --> 00:16:12.722
Yeah, I agree.

00:16:12.763 --> 00:16:16.058
Anyway, It's a pity I can't
make you some nice fresh fish,

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.644
especially seeing as you came
all the way from Crimonia.

00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:19.937
Ain't that right, Anz?

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:21.439
For sure, that'd be a dream!

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:23.232
I bet she would like
the way we serve it.

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:24.609
All the fixings.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.861
[YUNA]
Can you cook, too, Miss Anz?

00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:28.571
Nah, I'm still in training.

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:30.156
But she's got
a ton of potential.

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:31.240
When it comes to seafood,

00:16:31.282 --> 00:16:33.284
her skills are on par
with her old man's.

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:34.202
Yeah, right.

00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:37.330
Whoa. I'd really love to try
some of it while I'm here.

00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:38.915
Oh, come on. That's enough.

00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:41.542
You guys are embarrassing me.

00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:44.128
[YUNA]
I wanna eat seafood so bad.

00:16:48.716 --> 00:16:50.760
[YUNA] Wow, the city
is a lot more lively

00:16:50.801 --> 00:16:52.553
compared to when
I first arrived.

00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:55.056
That's one problem solved.

00:16:55.097 --> 00:16:58.476
But there's still a much
bigger problem to handle,

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:01.229
like the giant murder squid.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.940
Jeez. That thing's
obscenely huge.

00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:06.776
Kinda makes the black viper
look like a teensy worm.

00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:08.236
[ATOLA]
There you are, Yuna!

00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:09.820
[YUNA]
Hm? Atola?

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:11.948
It's so frustrating.
All we can really do

00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:15.326
is wait for the stupid beast
to pack up and leave on its own.

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:17.912
[YUNA] Yeah, an ocean
monster is a real challenge.

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:19.956
There's no way to
fight it head on, you know?

00:17:19.997 --> 00:17:22.041
We can't fly or walk on water.

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:24.377
We would have to
be excellent swimmers.

00:17:24.418 --> 00:17:26.379
[YUNA]
A tough fight, even for me.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:29.465
Well, we at least know
it has a weakness to fire.

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:30.883
[YUNA]
Hmm...

00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:35.846
[YUNA] But my power's not very
strong once it's over water.

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:37.974
Guess I won't be much
help this time; I'm sorry.

00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:41.394
Hey, no worries. You already
donated a ton of food to us;

00:17:41.435 --> 00:17:43.479
we can't ask you
for more than that.

00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:45.314
Although, we still
gotta do something

00:17:45.356 --> 00:17:47.024
about those pesky thieves.

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:49.986
Right. I almost forgot
about the bandit problem.

00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:53.155
I feel like we're real close
to finding some solid evidence.

00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:54.532
Evidence?

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:56.534
[ATOLA]
Never mind, just rambling!

00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:57.368
Now come on,

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.579
I'd like to get tomorrow's
batch of monsters from you

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.079
if that's okay?

00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:02.164
[YUNA]
All right fine, no need to push.

00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:04.792
[ATOLA] Hope another hundred
wolves isn't asking too much!

00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:06.669
For real? You remember that

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:09.130
I originally offered you
5,000 wolves, don'tcha?

00:18:09.171 --> 00:18:10.798
[ATOLA grunts]
Once again,

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:14.260
I can't believe how insanely
huge your item bag is.

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:27.982
[YUNA]
So, that's the story.

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:30.568
I'm probably gonna hang
around here for a little while.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.863
[FINA] I see. Well,
please don't worry about us.

00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:36.365
Everyone here is managing
just fine without you,

00:18:36.407 --> 00:18:37.742
but you are very missed.

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:41.537
[YUNA grunts]
That makes me feel kinda lonely.

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:43.497
Oh, yeah, I know how you feel.

00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:44.624
Because...

00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:45.499
[YUNA]
Because?

00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:48.085
[FINA] The truth is,
I'm feeling kinda lonely, too.

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:49.462
[gasps]

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:52.965
You know what?

00:18:53.007 --> 00:18:54.759
Once things are
taken care of here,

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.596
as long as Miss Tiermina
and Mister Gentz allow it,

00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:00.806
would you like to
visit Mileela with me?

00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:06.812
[FINA] Yes! Then we could go
and look at the ocean together!

00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:08.731
Sounds like we've got a plan.

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:12.652
Right, um, goodnight, then.

00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:28.709
[BOTH whine]

00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:30.419
[YUNA yawns]
What's wrong?

00:19:30.461 --> 00:19:32.254
Gotta potty?

00:19:34.757 --> 00:19:36.509
[YUNA]
Two intruders.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.761
It looks like they're
heading for my room.

00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:40.721
[KUMAKYU, KUMAYURU whimper]

00:19:55.486 --> 00:19:56.529
[BOTH gasp]

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:59.073
You've discovered one of three
ways to get on my bad side.

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:00.157
Congrats.

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:02.993
One, interrupt me while I'm
eating something delicious.

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:05.538
Two, interrupt me while
I'm in the middle of gaming.

00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:09.041
And then three,
interrupt me while I'm sleeping!

00:20:09.083 --> 00:20:11.335
Bear punch, punch, punch,
punch, punch, punch punch!

00:20:11.377 --> 00:20:14.922
[THIEVES groaning]

00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:17.174
[THIEF 10A] No one told
us she was so strong!

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:19.593
This was just supposed to
be a simple, in‐and‐out job

00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:22.221
to steal an item bag full of
monsters from a dumb girl.

00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:24.473
So that's what you're
after, huh? Well?

00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:25.808
Who gave you the orders then?

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.727
Hah! If you think we're
gonna be threatened

00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:29.895
by some kid playing
dress up, think again!

00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:32.690
Yeah. There's nothing
you can do to make us talk.

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:34.900
Oh? Let's find out.

00:20:34.942 --> 00:20:36.902
[KUMAYURU, KUMAKYU gasp]

00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:38.112

[BOTH screaming]

00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:42.533
[KUMAYURU, KUMAKYU roar]

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:45.244
[THIEVES]
B‐B‐B‐Bears!

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:47.788
These two aren't gonna talk,
so they're worthless.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.166
It looks like dinner is served.

00:20:50.207 --> 00:20:51.459
Wait! Hold on!

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.627
No way. See, here's the
thing, there's two of you

00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:57.506
and I only need one of you to
talk, so who wants to die first?

00:20:57.548 --> 00:20:58.215
[KUMAYURU, KUMAKYU]
Kuma!

00:20:58.257 --> 00:20:59.049
[THIEVES yelp]

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:01.218
[THIEF 10B] Crap, please don't
eat us, we're ready to talk!

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.511
We're part of
the band of thieves

00:21:02.553 --> 00:21:03.929
that's made this
area our home base!

00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:05.473
Okay, I'm listening.

00:21:05.514 --> 00:21:07.141
We were told that a girl
dressed like a bear

00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:09.101
had an insane
amount of treasure.

00:21:09.143 --> 00:21:11.353
Yeah, so our boss gave us
orders to try and rob you

00:21:11.395 --> 00:21:13.105
while you were sleeping tonight!

00:21:13.147 --> 00:21:17.067
[YUNA] Hmm. Good boys,
just one last question.

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:18.611
[THIEVES scream]

00:21:18.652 --> 00:21:20.780
Where might your hideout be?

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:29.830
[THIEVES laughing]

00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:32.082
It seems like nobody wants
to leave town lately.

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:34.460
My body's getting pretty stiff
from all the sitting around.

00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:36.170
Aw, c'mon, you can't blame 'em!

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:38.255
If they try to leave,
then scary thieves

00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:40.174
will take all their
fortunes and kill them!

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:43.427
Hiding in a town like cowards
is the only choice they have.

00:21:46.597 --> 00:21:48.599
It's probably
about time to move on.

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:49.809
We're gonna do one last job

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:52.102
and then we're headed
for greener pastu‐‐

00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:54.063

00:21:57.191 --> 00:21:58.943
[GROUP]
A bear?

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:01.612
Hello, boys. I'm here to
make you pay for your crimes.

00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:02.613
Huh?

00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:05.074
You've made too many
people in this town suffer.

00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:06.826
Oh, and let's not
forget about the crime of

00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:08.619
you interrupting my sleep.

00:22:08.661 --> 00:22:10.204
What the hell are
you talking about?!

00:22:10.246 --> 00:22:13.541
Bad news, turns out this
bear is pissed tonight.
