[gasps]

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.320
[ANZ]
It's made especially for you!

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:30.697
Wow, did you prepare
all this food yourself?

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:31.782
Yep!

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:33.951
Oh. The town pitched
in their resources

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:36.245
to give you a little
something extra.

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:39.081
[YUNA]
A miniature mountain of rice?!

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.754
[ANZ whimpers]

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:50.717
[YUNA squeals]

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:52.219
You like it?

00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:53.428
[ANZ gasps]

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.556
[YUNA]
Miss Anz...

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:58.267
wanna open a Wa restaurant
in Crimonia with me?

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:00.936
I'll fund the whole venture
and even find a location!

00:01:00.978 --> 00:01:03.730
I beg you... say yes!

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:05.274
[ANZ yells]

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:08.151
I'm happy for the offer,
but Crimonia is so far away!

00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:10.195
If I moved, I'd never
be able to see my family.

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:12.781
Not to mention how tough it'd be
to get my hands on fresh fish!

00:01:12.823 --> 00:01:15.909
One second. I just gotta
handle the travel problem?

00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:18.203
Deal! No take backsies, okay?

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:20.914
[gasping]

00:01:20.956 --> 00:01:23.500
Soon I'll be able to eat
food from Wa whenever I want!

00:01:23.542 --> 00:01:24.960
And I'll find a way
to make the travel easy!

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:26.587
[ATOLA]
Sounds like you're having fun.

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:28.755
Ah, Miss Atola!

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:31.883
Sorry to interrupt,
I just wanted to say thank you.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.051
So...

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:35.721
I've found that helping
others helps me, too.

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:38.890
You truly are a humble girl.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:42.436
If you don't mind, I actually
have a request for you.

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:45.063
Uh... for me?

00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:04.041
[gasps] Welcome home, Yuna!

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:06.376
You made it!

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:09.129
Fina!

00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:11.089
Aw, you're so sweet!

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.341
You came to meet me, huh?

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:14.051
I remembered you said
you'd be back today

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:15.594
and I couldn't wait.

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:17.429
Welcome home, Kumayuru!

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:18.347
[KUMAYURU squeaks]

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:20.057
Anyway, now that
you're finally home,

00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:21.475
do you have some time to relax?

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:22.893
I hope so!

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:24.519
I'm sorry, Fina.

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:27.064
I have a time‐sensitive
request to fulfill.

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:29.900
[FINA gasps]
Oh, of course.

00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:33.779
I guess there's no rest for
someone like you, huh, Yuna?

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.573
[YUNA]
Nope. I really am sorry, though.

00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:41.453
[FINA] Mm‐mm. It's okay;
your work's important.

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:46.875
[NOIR]
Miss Yuna!

00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:47.918
Hi!

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.671
[NOIR] We weren't expecting
your company! Ah!

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:53.006
Hold on, could it be that
you've come to visit with me?

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:54.299
Well, I have wished
to see you, too‐

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:56.093
[LALA]
Pardon me, my lady.

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:58.053
I believe that it's
time for your studies.

00:02:58.095 --> 00:02:59.388
Come with me now, please.

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.140
[NOIR gasps]
Lala! Have mercy!

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.392
I just wanna spend
a bit more time...

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:06.395
Uh, have fun studying, Noa!

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:11.775
[YUNA chuckles]

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:13.110
[CLIFF]
Hm.

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:16.113
The port town of Mileela wishes
to go under the wing of Crimonia

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:18.407
and receive the protection
of our kingdom, eh?

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:20.117
[YUNA]
Yep, and somehow I ended up

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:22.285
as the mediator
between you guys.

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:23.787
So what d'ya think?

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.082
[CLIFF sighs] Well, I'm
afraid it's a bit complicated.

00:03:27.124 --> 00:03:29.543
Why, though? You could
expand your borders.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:32.587
Have you forgotten about
the Elezent Mountains?

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.256
They're far too
hazardous to cross.

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:35.924
How would we even
negotiate with them,

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:38.510
much less protect their city?

00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:41.304
We can't just fly
over them, you know.

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:42.848
Maybe not, but there's no reason

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.141
you couldn't use
a tunnel, right?

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:45.934
Sure, that's easy to say,

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:47.936
but digging a tunnel
through the Elezent Mountains

00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:50.605
would take a great deal
of both time and capital.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:53.608
I'd have to disagree. [chuckles]

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.360
[CLIFF]
Uh?

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:57.779
[gasps]

00:03:57.821 --> 00:03:59.531
[YUNA]
I kinda already made one.

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:01.074
[CLIFF grunts]

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:03.201
Yuna, how'd you do this?

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:06.872
[YUNA] Hmm... I may
have used a little magic.

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.874
Dig and harden, dig and harden,

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.084
dig and harden, sleep,
dig and harden,

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:12.878
dig and harden, dig and harden.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.337
Somethin' like that.

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.673
[CLIFF]
Uhh...

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:19.718
All right.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.511
I'll make the journey
to Mileela on the morrow.

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:24.014
That soon?! For real?!

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:26.391
[YUNA grunts]

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:28.560
[MILAINE] So these are
the bears I've heard about!

00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:31.563
[MILAINE giggles]
They're so fluffy!

00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:33.982
Could you tell me why
Miss Milaine is here?

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:35.150
If we're planning
for the future,

00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:36.735
the involvement of
the merchant's guild

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:37.819
will be important.

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:40.197
That's why she's coming, too.

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.782
Plus, I have some
personal interest

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:43.825
in setting up
trade with Mileela.

00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:45.535
Despite that, you'd
have to go anyway

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:48.288
seeing as you're the guild
master of the Crimonia branch.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.499
Oh, that makes sense.
Guild master?!

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.834
That's right.
Did I forget to tell you?

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:54.252
I'm starting to
wonder if you might be

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.087
a bit older than you
look, Miss Milaine.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.216
I'm quite obviously
in my twenties.

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:03.595
Yeah... Sure.

00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:05.430
[YUNA] Still though, there's a
pretty big difference

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:09.267
between 20 and 29.
Just saying...

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:24.241
[CLIFF] I am the lord of
Crimonia, Cliff Foschurose.

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:25.992
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:27.244
And I'm Milaine,

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:29.496
the guild master of the
Crimonia merchant guild.

00:05:29.538 --> 00:05:31.039
Thanks so much for having me.

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:32.582
[ATOLA]
Hi! I am Atola,

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:35.293
the guild master of the
adventurer's guild here.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.962
I appreciate you both
making the journey

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.047
to our town even
though it's so far.

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:41.591
I thought you were gonna bring a
letter of response or something!

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:43.468
Why did you bring
these two here instead?

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.179
Well, they didn't
really give me a choice.

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:47.931
[stammers] Sorry, Yuna!

00:05:47.973 --> 00:05:51.977
There's a lot happening
and I'm just kinda flustered.

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:54.855
Not only did you capture a band
of thieves and hunt a kraken,

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:56.565
but then you go
and dig a huge tunnel

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:58.316
between both of
the towns for us?

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.610
I seriously can't
thank you enough.

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:02.529
Yeah, uh, can we
talk about that?

00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:04.447
I'd actually prefer if
you didn't tell anyone

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:05.949
about my involvement.

00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:08.451
Don't you worry. We can say
the tunnel was a joint effort

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:11.496
between Crimonia and Mileela
as part of our new agreement.

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.456
So there's no need
to disclose your name.

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:15.000
Oh, thank goodness.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:18.211
'Cause it would be super
embarrassing if people found out

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:20.088
that I dug a tunnel all
the way through the mountains

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.298
just so I could get my paws on

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.466
some rice, fresh seafood,
and a talented chef

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:25.510
who can cook food
from the Country of Wa.

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:26.887
[GROUP]
Uh...

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:29.973
[YUNA]
Anyway, it's in your hands now.

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:32.434
Yuna,

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.436
are you trying to tell us
you altered the landscape

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:36.855
of an entire mountain
range for personal gain?

00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:38.189
We can't let that slide,

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.984
so we'll need your support
on the tunnel after all, okay?

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:43.653
Yep, we're depending
on your help, Yuna!

00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:45.572
What? Hey...

00:06:45.614 --> 00:06:49.576
I just wanna go back to
Crimonia so I can relax a bit.

00:06:49.618 --> 00:06:52.412
Please?!

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.793
[FINA grunts]
Another lovely day.

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:02.339
I wonder if Yuna's
still busy with work.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.049
[YUNA]
I'm back...

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.175
Huh?

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:06.343
Hey there.

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:07.385
[FINA]
Yuna?!

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:10.180
[chuckles] Sorry that
I've been so busy.

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:12.766
But things have
finally settled down.

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.559
Are you ready for
a quick journey?

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:15.810
Uh, a journey to where?

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:17.437
Besides, I really
think you should try

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.605
and get a little rest.

00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:20.106
But I made a promise.

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:22.609
Now that I'm all finished
with things in Mileela,

00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:24.945
we can go and visit the ocean.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.616
[gasps]

00:07:29.658 --> 00:07:31.826
And as long as it's
okay with your mom,

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:33.787
I'd like to take Shuri with us.

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:36.373
[FINA gasps]

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:37.666
Yeah. Good plan.

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:41.086
Especially since she couldn't
go with us to the capital...

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:42.712
[FINA chuckles]

00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:53.139
[SHURI laughs]

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:58.895
[FINA] Wait, the ocean
is on the other side?

00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:00.188
[YUNA]
Sure is.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.731
This way, anyone
can cross without

00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:03.400
having to go over the mountains.

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:06.027
How cool. I can't believe
you made this by yourself.

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:07.278
You're so amazing!

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.571
Well, it may seem that way,

00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:10.532
but honestly the hardest
part of the whole endeavor

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:13.034
was stabilizing the cave
and the land around it.

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:14.077
[SHURI]
A bear!

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:15.829
See, sis? Right there!

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.623
It's a bear statue!

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:20.417
[FINA]
Um, Yuna?

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:21.876
Did...?

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:23.753
Please don't ask.

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.552
[FINA gasps]

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:33.388
[FINA, SHURI]
Ahh!

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.223
‐‐[FINA] Is that the ocean?
‐‐[SHURI] Oh, wow!

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:37.600
So pretty!

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.562
[YUNA giggles]

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:43.148
[YUNA] Come on, I'll show
you where we're staying.

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:47.193
You made another
bear house, Yuna?

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:48.820
It's huge!

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.989
[YUNA] Yep, I wanted
to make it extra big.

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:53.408
A sea‐side vacation home
large enough for the kids

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.202
from the orphanage or the staff
from the restaurant to use.

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:57.370
Y'know, to relax.

00:08:57.412 --> 00:08:59.748
Oh, wow, you're so thoughtful...

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:01.875
Can we go look
at the ocean now?

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:03.418
Sure. Let's do it.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.836
Hoo‐ray!

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:06.504
[YUNA]
Just be careful not to fall in.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:08.840
[SHURI]
I can't wait!

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:27.150
[FINA, SHURI gasp]

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:29.110
Amazing! Look at all the boats!

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:30.779
Whoa! I just saw a fish jump!

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.989
That's so neat.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.784
[FINA]
Yuna always goes out of her way

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.994
to teach me about
things I don't know.

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:41.998
Because of her, I've been
able to go lots of new places.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.875
Thanks so much...

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:44.292
...Yuna.

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:45.543
[BOY 12A]
Miss Bear!

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:48.254
[YUNA]
Uh, uhh...

00:09:48.296 --> 00:09:49.297
[BOY 12A] Hey, everyone!

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:52.675
Guess what!
The bear lady's here!

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:54.761
I'm so happy you've
come back to visit.

00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:56.429
Here, these are
some of the fresh fish

00:09:56.471 --> 00:10:00.058
that I caught earlier.
Help yourself!

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.810
[FISHER 12A]
Have some of mine, too!

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:04.854
We've been able to catch so much
now that the kraken is gone!

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:07.273
Would you like to try some
of the dried fish I made?

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:09.776
[FINA grunts]

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:14.280
Oh, wow. Miss Yuna's
really popular!

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:25.583
[NOIR] Miss Yuna!
I, Noa, have come to play!

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.127
[FINA]
One sec!

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:32.799
[NOIR gasps, screams]

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:34.717
What's the matter?

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:37.387
[NOIR] No way. I finished
all of my studies

00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:39.973
as fast as possible,
so I could come play,

00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:43.143
only to discover that Miss Yuna
is off hunting some monsters.

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:45.520
Yes. Sorry to tell you.

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:47.397
It's not your fault, Fina.

00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:48.314
And more importantly,

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:50.400
I apologize for
interrupting your work.

00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:52.777
Don't worry! You're not
interrupting me at all!

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:54.737
Though I am jealous
you got to have Miss Yuna

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:56.239
all to yourself in Mileela.

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:58.700
[FINA]
Mm... Well, not exactly.

00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:02.287
You see, my little sister,
Shuri, went with us, too, and...

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:05.999
Yuna seems to be pretty popular
no matter where she goes.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.626
[NOIR]
That's enough, Fina!

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:09.752
[gasps]

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:11.713
You're the V. P. of the M. B. F. C,

00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:13.965
so you simply must
be more aggressive!

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:17.886
See? Just like me,
your club's president!

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:21.556
But I'm not the
same as you, Lady Noa.

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:23.349
Fina...

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:29.022
I shall leave things
at that for today.

00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:31.566
But, please,

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:34.569
see that Miss Yuna gets this.

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:36.362
[YUNA]
I'm home.

00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:40.241
[YUNA] It's from Miss
Ellalaura in the capital.

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:41.701
[FINA]
Lady Noa's mother?

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:46.539
[YUNA] Mm. Apparently,
princess Flora has been crying.

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:48.708
She's been asking
to see the bear girl.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.335
Princess Flora?

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:53.379
Oh! So will you
go and visit her?

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:56.090
Of course. I can't just
leave a crying girl alone.

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:59.469
And it'll be quick
if I take Kumayuru.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.054
Couldn't you just
use the Bear Gate?

00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:02.138
No, I'd rather not.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.600
It'll cause suspicion if I
use the transfer gate too much.

00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:07.936
I know! Wanna tag along, Fina?

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:10.146
It'd make Kumakyu
happy to have a rider.

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:12.440
[gasps, grunts]

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.234
Uh, no, I'll pass.

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:16.611
I still have quite a lot
of harvesting work to do.

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:20.156
Uh. It's okay. I don't
mind if you take a break.

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:22.659
Harvesting is
my job, so I can't.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.661
And castles and royalty
make me nervous,

00:12:24.702 --> 00:12:27.080
so I should probably stay here.

00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:29.540
If that's really how ya feel.

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.793
In that case, I'll leave
a few days worth of monsters

00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:35.129
in the freezer of the
harvesting room for you.

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:38.925
[FINA chuckles]
Sounds good to me.

00:12:57.902 --> 00:13:01.239
[FINA grunting]

00:13:11.749 --> 00:13:13.584
[gasps]

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:29.851
[bear phone]
Kuma. Kuma‐‐

00:13:29.892 --> 00:13:30.685
[FINA] Um, Hello?

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:31.769
[YUNA]
Hey, it's Yuna.

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:33.438
Yeah, I figured.

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:35.231
[YUNA] Sorry for
calling so late at night.

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:36.232
I just got home.

00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:38.776
Great work on knocking out that
harvesting while I was gone.

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:40.445
[FINA]
Mm‐mm. I guess.

00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:42.822
Anyway, I was wondering,
could we talk about tomorrow?

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:44.991
[YUNA] Oh, yeah, I'm actually
heading back to Mileela.

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:45.783
[FINA]

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:47.160
[YUNA]
I'd mentioned it, remember?

00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:50.204
I told you about a girl chef who
could make Wa‐style cuisine?

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:51.873
I'm going to meet up
with her tomorrow.

00:13:51.914 --> 00:13:54.125
Oh, I see. Okay.

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:55.126
[YUNA]
But don't worry;

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:57.086
I'll make sure to load you up
with some more monsters

00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:58.296
before I go.

00:13:58.338 --> 00:14:02.133
Oh, I know! I'll prepare some
lunch and pudding for you, too!

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:04.552
Yep. That sounds wonderful.

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:05.303
[YUNA]
Well, goodnight, then!

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:07.138
[gasps] Hold on a second!

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.389
[YUNA]
Huh? What's up?

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:11.476
It's just, that tomorrow, I...

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:17.357
[FINA]
Mm... I promise to do my best.

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:18.816
So have a good night.

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:20.818
[YUNA]
Thanks. Same to you!

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:32.997
There. I'm finally
finished. Good.

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:35.792
Is Yuna back yet?

00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:37.126
[sighs]

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:38.795
Fina!

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:40.088
[yelps]

00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:42.131
I finally did it, Fina!

00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:44.509
I'm sorry, but, uh,
what are we talking about?

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.718
I'm feeling a
little bit confused!

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.053
[YUNA]
Miss Anz, the Wa chef,

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:49.639
finally agreed to
move to Crimonia!

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.893
[gasps] Oh. That's wonderful.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.648
[YUNA] This is the Wa‐style
food that Miss Anz made.

00:14:58.689 --> 00:15:00.525
So you wanna eat it together?

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:04.237
[FINA grunts] Mm‐hm.
Thanks for sharing with me.

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:08.116
It tastes great.

00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:09.742
Delicious, right?!

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:11.828
[YUNA squeals]
So good!

00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:13.329
I can't wait to open the shop.

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:14.872
I'll have to try
to find a good location

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:17.250
while Miss Anz finalizes
her preparations.

00:15:17.291 --> 00:15:19.794
[FINA]
You look so happy. Congrats.

00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:20.753
Of course!

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:23.840
Now I'll be able to eat
Japanese food here in Crimonia!

00:15:23.881 --> 00:15:25.258
Man, I'm so lucky
that I was able to

00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:28.261
find talented chefs like Miss
Morin and Miss Anz.

00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:30.179
[FINA grunts]

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:31.806
Hey, Yuna, listen.

00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:34.892
What? Don't tell me you're full.

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:38.604
No, actually I'd like to take a
break from harvesting for a bit.

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:41.607
[YUNA] Hm? Why, do you
have something to do?

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:44.068
Yeah, I wanna study
harvesting more.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.780
So I was thinking of
shadowing Dad at the guild.

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:48.322
[clattering]

00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:50.575
You hired me, but there's
still so much I don't know,

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:52.869
and I wanna make sure that I'm
useful to you!

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.120
[YUNA chuckles]

00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:57.123
Don't be silly. You're
already super useful to me.

00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:59.167
[FINA grunts]

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:02.795
Okay.

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:04.380
‐‐[FINA gasps]
‐‐[YUNA] Go for it.

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:06.674
I mean, if that's what you want.

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:09.051
Mm. Do your best.

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:12.722
[FINA]
Right...

00:16:12.763 --> 00:16:17.143
I promise. Thank you, Yuna.

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:20.563
[YUNA yawns]
Good morning, Fina.

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:24.025
Need me to put out some
monsters for you to harvest or‐‐

Fina?

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:31.157
I forgot. She took a break to
shadow her dad at the guild.

00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:37.330
Guess I'll go look for a
location for Miss Anz's shop.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:42.293
Jeez, Miss Milaine seemed
busier than usual today.

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:43.586
I wonder if digging that tunnel

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:45.630
has made life crazier
for the Merchant's Guild.

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:47.840
If so, I'll feel bad.

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:50.510
Well, at least I found a
good place for the shop.

00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:53.679
Except now I don't really
have anything to do.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.641
[snipping]

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:59.477
[GENTZ] That's right.
Avoid the tendons as you cut.

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:01.145
Good, you're doing great, Fina!

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:02.730
Yeah, but I'm nowhere
near as skilled

00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:04.524
at harvesting as you are.

00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:05.775
I gotta try harder.

00:17:05.816 --> 00:17:07.401
[gasps]

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:22.750
[NOIR]
Miss Yuna!

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:24.710
Fina?

00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:27.296
Miss Yuna! I finally
get to see you!

00:17:27.338 --> 00:17:29.632
Noa.

00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:31.217
[BOTH]
Kuma!

00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:34.971
Oh, wow! What sort
of cuteness is this?

00:17:35.012 --> 00:17:37.473
Miss Yuna, please
give me these cubs.

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:38.766
No dice.

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:40.977
I can't believe Fina
didn't tell me about this!

00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:43.104
Some member of the Miss Bear Fan
Club.

00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:44.564
Miss Bear what now?

00:17:44.605 --> 00:17:46.357
Never mind! It doesn't matter!

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:48.442
Anyway, where's Fina today?

00:17:48.484 --> 00:17:51.112
Oh. Well, you see...

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:53.948
So how is it?

00:17:55.783 --> 00:17:58.869
[GENTZ sighs]
I was wondering, Fina.

00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:01.372
Just how long do you
intend to shadow me?

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:04.083
Huh?! Uh, until I'm
a better harvester?

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:05.418
What's wrong?

00:18:05.459 --> 00:18:07.211
[FINA gasps]

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:11.424
[NOIR sighs]
Typical Fina.

00:18:11.465 --> 00:18:14.302
And after I told her
to be more aggressive.

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:17.138
It's so weird. I was
used to being on my own,

00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:20.016
and honestly,
it was easier that way.

00:18:20.057 --> 00:18:21.809
But lately, things have changed,

00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:25.605
and my heart's started to
feel a little empty inside.

00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:27.273
[gasps]

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:29.775
I eat, sleep, and do
whatever I wanna do,

00:18:29.817 --> 00:18:32.111
so I should feel
happy, but I'm not,

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:34.405
and it's like something
is just missing.

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:36.407
[NOIR] In that case,
may I ask a question?

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:37.283
Uh?

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:38.576
Hypothetically,

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:40.911
if someone you knew began to
distance themselves from you

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:43.539
or avoid you entirely,
what would you do?

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:45.458
Nothing, I guess.

00:18:45.499 --> 00:18:48.294
[NOIR]
What if... it was Fina?

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:51.422
[gasps]

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:52.965
[laughs]

00:18:53.007 --> 00:18:55.635
I suppose there are things
that even you don't understand.

00:18:55.676 --> 00:18:58.846
Well, duh, at the end of the day
I'm still just an ordinary girl.

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:00.931
Or a bear, I guess.

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:02.600
[BOTH laugh]

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:06.187
Sorry, but I've got something
that I need to take care of.

00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:12.109
Thanks for the advice, Noa.

00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:14.487
As acting president of
the Miss Bear Fan Club,

00:19:14.528 --> 00:19:17.198
it is my duty to work for the
happiness of the club members

00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:20.201
and Miss Yuna alike.

00:19:20.242 --> 00:19:23.120
That said, I refuse to
lose to my bear rival.

00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:26.207
I promise, Fina.

00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:28.626
[FINA]
Recently, I realized something.

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:31.045
Yuna is somebody who is amazing
at everything she does,

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:33.839
and no matter where she goes,
people adore her.

00:19:33.881 --> 00:19:35.091
I mean, that is true.

00:19:35.132 --> 00:19:36.676
After all,
we wouldn't be a family

00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:38.386
if it weren't for Yuna's help.

00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:40.471
Because I owe her so much,

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:43.474
I couldn't just tell her that
I wanted to spend time with her.

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:46.060
I didn't want to
come off as selfish.

00:19:47.353 --> 00:19:52.024
[FINA] I'm not a princess,
and I can't make delicious food.

00:19:52.066 --> 00:19:53.693
I'm useless...

00:19:53.734 --> 00:19:56.821
...except for
harvesting monsters.

00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:59.156
Oh, wow.

00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:00.950
You're always acting so mature.

00:20:00.991 --> 00:20:04.203
Sometimes I forget
you're a ten‐year‐old kid.

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:05.371
It's okay.

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:06.997
You're allowed to be selfish.

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:07.957
Huh?

00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:09.583
If you want some
time alone with Yuna,

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:11.127
just tell her that.

00:20:11.168 --> 00:20:13.671
Go out there and
find your courage.

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.881
My courage?

00:20:15.923 --> 00:20:19.301
Otherwise, you'll
be like the old me.

00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:24.390
[FINA gasps]
Mm!

00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:27.143
That's good advice.
Thank you, Dad!

00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:31.897
[FINA gasps]

00:20:31.939 --> 00:20:33.357
Fina.

00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:35.276
[FINA]
Find your courage...

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:37.445
...and just tell her.

00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:38.612
[FINA]
Uh!

00:20:40.823 --> 00:20:43.659
Come on. There's somewhere
I really wanna take you.

00:20:50.374 --> 00:20:53.627
[FINA]
Wait, this place...

00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:55.087
You know I'm not from here.

00:20:55.129 --> 00:20:58.048
My hometown's super far away.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.217
It's so far that I'm
not sure I could get back

00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:01.969
even if I decided to try.

00:21:02.011 --> 00:21:03.596
[gasps]

00:21:05.848 --> 00:21:07.641
[YUNA] Over there,
I did whatever I wanted

00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:09.810
every single day.

00:21:09.852 --> 00:21:11.771
But I was alone.

00:21:11.812 --> 00:21:13.564
Hold on, really?

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:15.232
What about your mom and dad?

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:16.734
Or your friends?

00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:19.737
[YUNA] Mm... Honestly,
I never needed them.

00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:21.614
How sad.

00:21:21.655 --> 00:21:23.991
Do you ever think
about going home?

00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:25.910
[YUNA] Hmm... In all
the time I've been here,

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:28.913
I've never given serious
thought to going back there.

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:30.164
I'm not really
the type of person

00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:33.793
who gets easily attached to
particular people or places.

00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:36.170
[YUNA]
That's why

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:39.882
I initially didn't plan on
staying here in Crimonia.

00:21:39.924 --> 00:21:41.675
And I certainly never
thought I would end up

00:21:41.717 --> 00:21:44.470
hiring someone I just met...

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:46.722
...like a young
girl in the forest.

00:21:46.764 --> 00:21:49.433
[gasps] Then why did you?

00:21:49.475 --> 00:21:51.101
Please tell me, Miss Yuna.

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:52.895
How is it that
you can be so kind

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:54.980
when you barely even know me?

00:21:56.357 --> 00:21:58.192
[YUNA]
There were a few reasons.

00:21:58.234 --> 00:22:02.488
Like how I can't harvest or
that Gentz asked me to help you.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.573
It's kinda hard to pin one down.

00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:07.910
[YUNA]
But, you know,

00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:10.955
after spending time with you,

00:22:10.996 --> 00:22:15.167
being around you started to
feel so natural and comfortable.

00:22:15.209 --> 00:22:17.628
And I've never felt that before.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.421
In the end,

00:22:19.463 --> 00:22:21.966
the reason doesn't matter.

00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:24.176
[inaudible]

00:22:27.304 --> 00:22:29.473
[YUNA]
Because now,

00:22:29.515 --> 00:22:31.350
you're someone I care about.

00:22:31.392 --> 00:22:35.312
[gasps] You really mean that?

00:22:38.274 --> 00:22:42.570
[whimpers]
'Cause I... feel the same.

00:22:42.611 --> 00:22:45.906
I care about you! And I want
us to spend more time together!

00:22:45.948 --> 00:22:48.492
Just the two of us, okay?

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:55.124
Yeah, even if I'm a bear?

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.502
[FINA]
Miss Bear...

00:23:00.087 --> 00:23:02.423
...you're not going
to eat me, are you?

00:23:02.464 --> 00:23:04.133
[gasps]

00:23:06.176 --> 00:23:08.262
I would never.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.096
Hey there, Yuna! Welcome home.

00:23:51.138 --> 00:23:54.016
Yeah, I'm home... Fina.
