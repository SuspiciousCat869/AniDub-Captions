[KAI panting]

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:42.918
[ADVENTURER 1A]
There's a goblin hunting quest.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.253
[ADVENTURER 1B]
Can you use magic?

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:47.339
We're looking for
a temporary party member.

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:50.342
[ADVENTURER 1C] Quest finished!
Now let's go get a drink!

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:53.345
[KAI panting]

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:56.181
Help me! I beg of you!
It's my village!

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:59.560
We're under attack
by a black viper!

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.692
Excuse me, but is it
really a black viper?

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.193
It's not a normal one?

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:10.320
Listen, I know what I saw, okay?

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:13.323
Normal snakes can't swallow
livestock and people whole!

00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:15.117
[sighs]

00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:18.579
I'm so sorry, young man.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.332
But we're unable to accept
your request at this time.

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:26.420
Why can't you? Oh, of course,
you want money, right?

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:28.380
Here, this is all the
money from my village!

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:30.132
If it's not enough,
I'll work for the rest!

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:31.633
We can't...

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:34.011
...because we have
no one capable enough.

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:35.012
[KAI]
Wait, what?

00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:36.888
How can that be?

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.849
All the adventurers
who are ranked high enough

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.560
to defeat a black viper
are currently away.

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:44.229
We have no idea
when they'll return.

00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:46.815
Of course, I'll try and
contact them immediately.

00:01:46.857 --> 00:01:49.610
We can ask our lord
to send an expedition,

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:52.487
but it would be several days
before we could proceed.

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:54.072
[KAI]
I don't have several days.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:56.199
Everyone I know
could be dead by then!

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:59.536
Please! There has to be
someone who can help!

00:01:59.578 --> 00:02:00.746
[ADVENTURER 1C]
You should go.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:02.873
[ADVENTURER 1B]
I can't fight a viper!

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:05.792
If Mister Deborane were here,
he'd pull it off for sure.

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:08.587
[gasps] That's it? No!

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.213
What am I supposed
to tell all the people

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:12.424
who are counting on me?

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:14.718
[YUNA]
I could go if ya want.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.470
[KAI gasps]

00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:24.895
Hey there, squirt,
the name's Yuna.

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:27.856
So then, you've got a quest?

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:41.787
All right, let's get
this game started.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.419
[YUNA]
So, Miss Helen,

00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:51.838
where is this village and
is it far from Crimonia?

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.257
Uh, it's about a day
and a half's ride by horse

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.801
toward the southeast.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:59.554
[YUNA] I don't really
understand horse distance.

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:02.182
Whatever. I'll just
start heading that way.

00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:04.810
[HELEN gasps]
Hold on a moment!

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:06.019
You can't rush in.

00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:08.480
Black vipers can grow up
to 50 meters in length.

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:09.773
Even a skilled adventurer would

00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:11.692
have trouble dealing
with one of them!

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.985
But his village
is in danger, right?

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:17.114
Besides, I've never seen
a real black viper before.

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:18.949
[KAI]
Are you kidding me right now?!

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.034
How am I supposed to
take you seriously?!

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:24.121
A girl in a bear suit
can't beat a viper!

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:26.081
[YUNA]
Guess I do look kinda lame.

00:03:26.123 --> 00:03:28.250
I appreciate the offer,

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:29.584
but this would be
asking too much

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:32.212
of someone like you, Miss Yuna.

00:03:32.254 --> 00:03:33.088
[YUNA]
'Kay, then,

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.340
what if I just go do
some scouting instead?

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:37.134
I'm not sure what you mean.

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:40.345
Well, I could go and collect
some intel on the monster.

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.639
If I got some more info
on its size and location,

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:45.058
then we could share it with
the high‐ranking adventurers.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.645
Yes, I see. And would
that be all right with you?

00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:52.816
[grunts] I mean, if it'll
really help us survive,

00:03:52.858 --> 00:03:54.276
okay.

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:55.569
[YUNA]
I might actually fight it,

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.739
but they don't need
to know all the details.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.574
It sounds like a start.

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:02.617
And I'll contact the
high‐ranking adventurers

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.286
as quickly as possible.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.997
Please don't do anything
too reckless, okay?

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:09.750
Right. You can count on me!

00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:17.716
Uh! Are you going
on a quest, Miss Bear?

00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:19.342
Be safe out there.

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:21.428
Yeah, I always am.

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:25.182
Whoa, hold on a
second, bear lady!

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:26.391
I wanna go, too.

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:29.853
So please, take me with you!

00:04:29.895 --> 00:04:31.813
You're just gonna
get in the way.

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:34.149
[grunts] I know that.

00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:36.485
Still though, at least
let me guide you there.

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:37.652
It'll save time.

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:40.697
And I can show you the
fastest possible route!

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:42.240
[YUNA]
Hmm...

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.117
[YUNA]
Well, it's true that he

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.204
can probably get
us there faster.

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:48.955
[YUNA] If you start whining,
then I'll ditch you.

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:49.915
Got it, kid?

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:52.834
[gasps] Name's Kai.
I won't complain!

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:55.796
Okay, did you come to
Crimonia by horse?

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:58.465
[KAI] Yeah. But I galloped
here without letting it rest,

00:04:58.507 --> 00:04:59.966
so it's pretty exhausted.

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:02.636
There's no way it's
ready to ride again.

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:05.388
Don't worry, I'll handle
the transportation.

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:08.975
[YUNA]
Time for you guys to come out.

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.816
[KAI screams]

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:18.443
[KAI] Whoa, you can
summon actual bears?!

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:20.403
What in the world
are you exactly?

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:22.697
I'm just a normal adventurer.

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:24.658
By the way, these are
my special summon beasts,

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.828
so I promise you
they aren't dangerous.

00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:31.706
Let's go, Kumayuru.

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:33.041
[KUMAYURU squeaks]

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:35.544
Okay, Kumakyu, give
the kid a lift will ya?

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:37.254
[KUMAKYU grumbles]

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:39.339
There's no need for
the puppy dog eyes.

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:41.883
I'll ride on you for the journey
back, so quit your sulking.

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:44.010
[KUMAKYU grumbles]

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:47.389
[KAI]
Um, miss?

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.973
Huh?

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:51.518
I've never ridden on
top of a bear before.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.811
[gasps]

00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:53.979
It'll be okay!

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.398
Even if you accidentally
lose your grip or go to sleep,

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:59.025
it's practically impossible
to fall off my bear mounts.

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:02.988
Are you positive? Whoa!

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:06.157
[KAI screams]

00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:09.786
What's the matter, kid?

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:11.621
Weren't you gonna
show me the way there?

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:14.416
[screams]

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:16.877
Um, yes! Go that way!

00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:19.504
[KAI yelps]

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:32.976
[KAI screams]
Turn here!

00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:34.728
[YUNA]
Let's take a quick break.

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:36.563
[sighs]

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:40.108
So, how far out are we?

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.319
Uh, looks like
we're about halfway.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.363
You rode all night, didn't you?
Give me the directions

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.157
and you can sleep the
rest of the way there.

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:49.451
[KAI]
Mm‐mm. Sleep will have to wait.

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:51.036
It's my responsibility
to get you

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:53.580
to the village as
fast as possible.

00:06:53.622 --> 00:06:56.666
And yet earlier, you
didn't want my help at all.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.295
I'm sorry for what I said.

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:02.297
I'm sure that you're
an amazing adventurer,

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.591
especially if you can
summon beasts like these.

00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:06.343
I get the feeling
that you might be able

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:09.220
to actually do something
about the black viper.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:11.431
[YUNA] Wow, he changed
his tune real quick.

00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:14.142
It doesn't matter if I
collapse from exhaustion.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:18.897
What's important is that I bring
us help before it's too late.

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:21.900
[YUNA] The kids in this
world are all so strong.

00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:24.527
We'd better get
back on the road, huh?

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.988
I'll ride you the
rest of the way, Kumakyu.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.281
[KUMAKYU squeaks]

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:29.866
You get Kai, Kumayuru.

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:31.534
[KUMAYURU grunts]

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:33.954
[KAI whimpers]

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:36.915
[KAI screams]

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:45.090
This it?

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:48.009
Hey! Everyone! It's me!

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:51.262
Kai! I've brought
help from Crimonia!

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:54.015
[gasping]

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:56.393
Everyo‐‐

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:57.936
Would you please stop shouting?

00:07:57.978 --> 00:07:59.312
[KAI grunts]

00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:03.024
[YUNA] It's okay.
There are people here.

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:05.694
But I don't see
any large targets.

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:06.611
Hey!

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:08.571
[KAI panting]

00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:10.657
Father! Mother!

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:12.200
You're back!

00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:16.663
Thank goodness you're all right.

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:19.541
[KAI] I was scared!
I didn't see anyone!

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:21.376
[KAI'S DAD]
Keep your voice down.

00:08:21.418 --> 00:08:22.210
[KAI]
Sorry.

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:25.296
So anyway, who is this
oddly dressed young lady

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:26.548
you've brought with you?

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:29.801
[YUNA] Yeah, I do look
like a total weirdo...

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:32.220
[KAI'S MOM coughs]

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:34.556
[KAI] You see, with
everything going on,

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:37.684
my mother hasn't
been doing well.

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:40.061
So I had to go to get help.

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:42.063
I know.

00:08:42.105 --> 00:08:44.232
[gasps] So then‐‐

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:48.153
[KAI] Yep! This girl is an
adventurer. She came to scout!

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:52.490
[KAI'S DAD] Are you serious?
In that ridiculous bear suit?

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:56.411
[KAI]
Don't worry! They also said

00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:59.664
they'd contact some
high‐ranking adventurers.

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:01.750
[KAI'S DAD]
I suppose that's good news,

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:04.294
but who knows if
we'll last that long.

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:07.338
[KAI'S DAD]
By the way,

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.758
I should tell you
that Elmina from next door

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.426
and Rond from the general store

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:14.054
tried to escape
and both were eaten.

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:15.889
[KAI]
What?! They were?

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.475
[KAI'S DAD] So, you're a
pretty low‐ranked adventurer,

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:21.811
aren't you? What exactly
are you hoping to achieve?

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:24.647
I came here to collect
information on the snake.

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:27.067
And if I can,
I'll also take it down.

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:29.194
[KAI'S DAD scoffs]
If you can?

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:32.697
[laughs]

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:33.907
[KAI'S DAD]
There's no way!

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:34.741
[KAI]
Father!

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:37.535
[YUNA] I'll be the one
to decide that, thank you.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:39.204
Hurry and tell me
everything that you know

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:41.372
about the black viper.

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:43.666
[gasps]

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:49.172
[sighs] Very well, then.

00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:52.759
It pops up from nowhere
and slithers around town.

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:55.095
It eats anyone it sees.

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:57.722
The black viper seems
to respond to noise,

00:09:57.764 --> 00:10:01.684
so trying to escape from it
is practically impossible.

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:03.895
Kai was lucky he got away.

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:05.271
Most have perished.

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:06.314
[KAI gasps]

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:07.941
Sounds like I'll be
able to find its nest

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:10.193
if I follow the
tracks it left behind.

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:12.028
Okay. Thanks a lot.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.863
I'll go and check it out.

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:15.198
[KAI'S DAD gasps]
You're serious?

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.950
[YUNA]
Sure am.

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:18.576
Oh, one more thing.

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:21.412
If this goes south,
use me as a distraction,

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.832
and you guys run away.

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:25.208
[door closes]

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:29.504
Escaping the viper
is impossible.

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:30.922
We'd never make it.

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:33.133
We'd all die.

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:37.387
[gasps]

00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:39.722
[KAI]
Miss!

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:42.642
About that... sorry.

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:45.520
Everybody is at their limit.

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:47.313
[YUNA]
It doesn't bother me.

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:48.148
Still though!

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:50.400
Look, I get it‐‐
I'm dressed like a bear.

00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:52.819
You left to go get help
and came back with me.

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:54.904
I'd probably be worried, too.

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:57.240
You don't have
to do this! [gasps]

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:02.537
Hey. You're a good kid, Kai.
Thanks for worrying about me.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.917
[KAI]
Be safe.

00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:27.312
Well, the trail ends here,

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:29.856
so I guess this must
be the viper's nest.

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:32.150
You can retreat for
right now, Kumayuru.

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:33.902
[KUMAYURU whines]

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:35.695
I'll be okay.

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:41.784
Cool. Snake hunting time.

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:47.749
[YUNA]
Hm? It disappears?

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:51.377
Okay.

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:54.881
Where would something
that big even hide out here?

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:57.342
Well, since I can't
see it with my own eyes,

00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:59.302
I'll use bear vision.

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:03.973
[YUNA grunts]
It's here?

00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:05.975
[yelps]

00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:10.897
Ah, so it was hiding!

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:15.735
Big guy.

00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:17.946
That certainly explains
why all the villagers

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:20.281
were so doom and
gloom about you.

00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:21.950
[VIPER snarls]

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:26.162
Look, I dunno why you chose
to make your nest out here,

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:28.748
but I'm gonna have to evict you.

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:34.045
[VIPER snarls]

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:35.797
Not good.

00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:38.591
If fire doesn't work,
how about this?

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.226
[VIPER grunts]

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:51.729
Man, that woulda hurt if it
weren't for my bear onesie.

00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:55.358
[YUNA]
Bear punch!

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.527
[roars]

00:12:57.568 --> 00:12:59.320
[YUNA grunts]

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:07.245
[YUNA]
You're a tough one.

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:12.208
Really? Didn't work either?

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.793
Uh!

00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:15.878
[YUNA]
Crap.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.171
It's fast and powerful,

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:20.174
but the biggest problem is
definitely it's thick skin.

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:24.304
It can deflect both
physical and magical attacks.

00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:26.597
[VIPER snarls]

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.516
[YUNA]
Hmm...

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:30.643
[YUNA] If I give in
and use my trump card,

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:33.104
then its snakeskin
wouldn't be a problem at all,

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:36.065
but I also wouldn't be
able to bring home its parts.

00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:38.484
Well, there's
other stuff to try.

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:40.111
Following basic theory,

00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:41.821
If I can't hurt the outside,

00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:44.032
then I'll try the inside!

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:55.084
[YUNA] It's hard to fight
against your instincts.

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:56.711
Try this one on for size.

00:13:56.753 --> 00:13:58.254
Go!

00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:11.225
Yes! It opened its mouth.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.480
[YUNA]
My magic is special.

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:16.939
If I want a spell
to be powerful,

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:20.526
then all I have to do is imagine
it to get the results I want!

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:22.445
[BEARS]
Kuma!

00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:31.704

Bear magic.

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:34.123
Behold my Bears of Fire!

00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:36.084
Go!

00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:41.130
[BEARS]
Kuma! Kuma! Kuma...

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:54.060
That should take care of that.

00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:06.697
Oh. Guess I'll put you away.

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:19.585
Huh? Look who it is.

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:24.882
Hey, what are you
doin' out here, Kai?

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:28.052
Helping! If you were being
chased by the black viper,

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:29.887
I was gonna let
myself get eaten by it,

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:32.140
so you could get
back to Crimonia safely.

00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:33.266
Huh? Why though?

00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:35.977
You know why! The information
that you take back with you

00:15:36.018 --> 00:15:37.311
could help the other adventurers

00:15:37.353 --> 00:15:40.440
beat the black viper and
save our entire village!

00:15:40.481 --> 00:15:43.609
If it would save everyone,
then I'd gladly risk my life!

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:45.236
[YUNA]
Jeez, the kids in this world

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:48.489
are certainly prepared for
the worst possible scenarios.

00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:49.991
[YUNA]
Hm...

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.494
It's okay.

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:55.705
I defeated the
black viper already.

00:15:55.746 --> 00:15:56.539
Oh?

00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:58.916

courage for another time.

Hm?

I'm the chief of
this village, Zun.

00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:17.059
Are all the rumors true?

00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:19.812
Did you really
defeat the black viper?

00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:21.481
Yeah, isn't that obvious?

I'm sorry, young lady.

And thank you.

If it weren't for you,
we would have died.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.273
It's fine. Nobody would
think a bear girl like me

00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:46.941
could defeat a black viper.

I understand your doubt.

Our entire village
is indebted to you.

If there is ever a way
for us to repay you,

00:17:52.863 --> 00:17:54.615
all you have to do is ask.

We may be sad,

00:18:23.227 --> 00:18:27.523
but being a survivor means
pushing through our grief.

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:30.109
If only I had gotten here
a little bit sooner.

00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:32.028
None of this is
your fault, Miss Bear!

00:18:32.069 --> 00:18:32.862
You came out here

00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:34.864
even though you're not a
high‐ranking adventurer!

00:18:34.905 --> 00:18:38.242
You put yourself at risk for
people you don't really know!

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:40.453
Oh!

00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:42.371
That'll do, kid.

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:50.921
[BIRD crows]

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:52.882
[YUNA grunts]

00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:55.426
[YUNA] That sound
is strangely familiar.

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:57.720
[YUNA gasps]

00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:04.560
I can't remember the
last time I had actual eggs!

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:07.271
These are, like, impossible
to find in Crimonia!

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:11.025
[ZUN chuckles] Yes, well,
eggs break very easily

00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:13.694
so they can be
quite difficult to sell.

00:19:13.736 --> 00:19:15.404
There are couple of wild kokekko

00:19:15.446 --> 00:19:18.783
not far from our village
and that's where we get them.

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:21.786
What kind of bird
is a kokekko exactly?

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:23.579
[ZUN]
Well, unlike a normal bird,

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:25.665
it cannot fly very
high in the air,

00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:27.291
so it nests down on the ground

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:30.002
and makes a loud cry
early in the morning.

00:19:30.044 --> 00:19:31.379
[YUNA]
That's just a chicken.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.713
[CHICKEN crows]

00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:34.173
If you like eggs that much,

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:36.133
would you like to
take a few home with you?

00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:37.134
[ZUN gasps]

00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:39.220
You really mean it?!

00:19:40.304 --> 00:19:42.765
[KAI] Thank you again
for everything, Miss Bear.

00:19:42.807 --> 00:19:44.850
I'm gonna work super
hard to get strong,

00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:46.435
so I can be just like you!

00:19:46.477 --> 00:19:50.731
Uh! The path of a bear
can be pretty tough.

00:19:50.773 --> 00:19:53.609
Take care of yourself, kid.

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:56.028
Thanks! You, too, miss!

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.700
[KAI]
Goodbye! Safe travels!

00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:05.579
[YUNA]
Yo, I'm back!

00:20:05.621 --> 00:20:06.455
Miss Yuna?

00:20:06.497 --> 00:20:08.374
You're back earlier
than I expected.

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:11.377
What's up? Are you going on
a journey, Guildmaster?

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:15.005
Sadly, we were unable to find
any high‐ranking adventurers.

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:18.426
Yes, I'm going to head to town
and handle the request myself.

00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:20.636
Did you bring back any
information on the viper?

00:20:20.678 --> 00:20:23.264
Oh, I defeated the black
viper. It's super dead.

00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:24.932
[ADVENTURERS gasp]

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:26.726
[ADVENTURERS yell]

00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:29.270
What?! You shouldn't joke
about such serious matters.

00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:32.523
I have the blessings
of the bears, remember?

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:34.233
Wanna see its body?

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:35.901
[RALOCK]
Wait! Don't take it out here!

00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:37.737
You'll crush the entire guild!

00:20:37.778 --> 00:20:39.321
Oh, yeah, good point.

00:20:39.363 --> 00:20:41.949
I thought you just went
ahead to get information!

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:44.618
That's Yuna for you. I doubt
there's anything she could do

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.495
that would still surprise me.

00:20:46.537 --> 00:20:48.581
[ADVENTURER 1C] Just what I'd
expect from the Bloody Bear!

00:20:48.622 --> 00:20:51.333
A black viper is
nothing for her.

00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:55.045
[LANZ] Hmph. Mister Deborane's
rival is as strong as ever.

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:57.840
All right, I guess that finishes
up that quest. [chuckles]

00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:02.178
[sighs]

00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:05.306
Well, another day,
another perfect in‐game run.

00:21:07.016 --> 00:21:08.976
Better check my stocks.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.689
Sell. Sell. Buy.

00:21:13.731 --> 00:21:16.776
That's awesome. My accounts
have increased again.

00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:18.861
[phone rings]

00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:22.281
[YUNA]
What's up, Grandpa?

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:24.950
Yeah, I'm doin' okay.

00:21:24.992 --> 00:21:27.578
How's school?
I don't go anymore.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.456
I've told you,
it's just a waste of time.

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:32.500
What about Mom and Dad?

00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:35.044
They wanted to go
on a long vacation.

00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:38.047
[YUNA]
No, I haven't heard from them

00:21:38.088 --> 00:21:40.090
since I gave them more money.

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:42.968
They're probably having
the time of their life.

00:21:44.678 --> 00:21:47.598
[YUNA] Huh? What do you mean
you want me to come visit?

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.100
Or else you'll stop
co‐signing for my apartment?

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:53.354
[YUNA groans]
Fine, whatever makes you happy.

00:21:53.395 --> 00:21:55.064
See ya.

00:21:56.774 --> 00:22:00.152
[sighs] Talk about a headache.

00:22:00.194 --> 00:22:02.321
I'll play just a bit longer...

00:22:02.363 --> 00:22:04.782
...to help brighten my mood.

00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:07.117
World Fantasy Online.

00:22:08.911 --> 00:22:12.998
[YUNA] It's the first
ever VRMMO fantasy RPG.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:18.504
[YUNA] And what's more,
it's the world I now live in.

00:22:20.714 --> 00:22:21.924
[YUNA chuckles]

00:23:52.681 --> 00:23:54.642
[KUMAYURU]
Kuma!
