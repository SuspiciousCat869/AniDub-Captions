WEBVTT

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:23.732
[YUNA yawns]
I slept great!

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.581
Nice! I'm fully recovered.

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.505
Man, this suit
really is amazing.

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:48.799
I can't believe these
never get dirty.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.009
Talk about convenient.

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:02.437
Okay!

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:05.232
Time to go adventuring.

00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:41.620
[YUNA]
Ice Arrow!

00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:47.542
[gasps]

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:48.960
Harvest these, please!

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.463
[FINA]
Right! I'll do my best!

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:54.257
Bear Punch, go!

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:56.843
Here's more!

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.762
[FINA]
I'll do my best...

00:02:58.804 --> 00:03:00.389
Have a Bear Kick!

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.683
[BOAR groans]

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:04.059
Ta‐dah!

00:03:04.101 --> 00:03:05.811
[FINA]
Um... I'm sorry.

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:07.521
Huh?

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:08.980
What?

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.816
[GENTZ] Look, it's great
that you're giving Fina

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:14.277
so much work to do,
but this might be too much.

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.655
This pile is gonna take her a
long time.

00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:19.032
I guess harvesting is
pretty tough work, huh?

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:20.992
Yeah, kind of.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.661
But when I think
about how much work

00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:23.995
you put into hunting them,

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:26.164
I try to be extra careful
with their materials,

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:29.626
and it ends up taking
longer for me to complete.

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:31.795
[YUNA]
She is such a sweet child!

00:03:31.837 --> 00:03:34.631
The harvesting facility
is a shared space.

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:37.676
We encourage people to take
turns if it's really crowded.

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:39.428
[YUNA]
Ah, makes sense.

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.096
Sorry I let you down, Yuna.

00:03:41.138 --> 00:03:42.681
Hey, now, don't apologize.

00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:45.016
It's not your fault
that the place is so busy.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.601
If anything,
I should be thanking you

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.854
for being so careful
with all your harvesting.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.439
Yeah?

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.901
[YUNA chuckles]

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:58.613
[YUNA]
Still though, what should I do?

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:02.159
[VILLAGER 3A]
A bear?

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.993
[VILLAGER 3B]
That's so strange.

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:04.202
[VILLAGER 3C]
It's her.

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:05.245
[VILLAGER 3D]
She's back.

00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:07.122
[ADVENTURER 3A] I heard she
hunted another pack of wolves

00:04:07.164 --> 00:04:09.332
and overloaded the
harvesting facility.

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:10.500
[ADVENTURER 3B]
Not just wolves!

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:13.420
She's hunted everything in the
vicinity close to extinction!

00:04:13.462 --> 00:04:16.131
[ADVENTURER 3C] Bears live
at the top of the food chain!

00:04:16.173 --> 00:04:18.216
[YUNA] These stories are
starting to get real wild.

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.969
[HELEN]
Miss Yuna, do you have a moment?

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:22.179
[YUNA]
Hm?

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.808
[HELEN] I'm sorry to ask,
but could you please hold off

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.727
hunting in this
area for a while?

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:30.270
Huh? Why, though?

00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:31.354
The forest near here

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:33.148
is a good spot for
budding adventurers,

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.483
but at the rate
you're clearing it out,

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:37.068
there won't be any quests
left for the new people.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.738
Yeah, but I'm
still budding, too.

00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:42.824
Most new adventurers

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:46.244
can't take down a whole
pack of wolves by themselves.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:47.496
[YUNA grunts]

00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:51.625
[YUNA]
There go my plans for the day.

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:52.667
[LANZ]
I've found you!

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:53.543
Huh?

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:54.586
[LANZ]
You're the little brat

00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:56.963
who punched Mister
Deborane in the face!

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:58.465
[YUNA]
Huh?

00:04:58.507 --> 00:05:00.675
[YUNA]
Whoa! Who punched who?

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:02.052
[LANZ]
I'm talking about you!

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:04.679
The girl wearing the
stupid bear costume!

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.139
‐‐[YUNA] Me?
‐‐[LANZ] Yes, you!

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:08.934
How dare you lay your
paws on Mister Deborane?!

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.852
Deborane.

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:11.978
Uh, who's that?

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.898
[LANZ gasps] You just beat
him up the day before yesterday

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.317
with your cowardly
tactics, remember?!

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:18.652
[YUNA]
I did?

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:20.612
Oh, yeah, you mean
the weird goblin dude.

00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:23.323
Or hobgoblin dude,
it's whatever.

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:24.574
It's not whatever!

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.493
You can't go around
calling people monsters!

00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:29.204
That's plain rude,
you know! Ugh!

00:05:29.246 --> 00:05:30.580
That's enough, Lanz.

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.791
Gil? Let me go!

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:34.084
You're embarrassing us.

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:36.294
I'm so sorry about
our party member.

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:40.006
And you must be
the infamous Yuna.

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:41.049
Yeah.

00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:42.259
[RULINA]
My name is Rulina.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.720
We're actually in a party
together with Mister Deborane.

00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:50.267
[RULINA] See, we had accepted
a quest to hunt some goblins.

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:51.726
Ah, but then I
beat you to the punch

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:54.938
by hunting down the goblin
known as Deborane instead.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.023
That's Mister Goblin Deborane!

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:58.358
To be perfectly honest,

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.443
I don't blame you for
punching him, you know?

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.320
Rulina! Whose side are you on?!

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:04.322
Well, it was Deborane's fault.

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:05.782
What's the problem
with you guys?!

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:08.076
Why are you siding with
a girl in a bear costume?

00:06:08.118 --> 00:06:09.870
[GIL]
We're not siding with anyone.

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:12.122
From what I heard, Deborane
picked the wrong fight.

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.416
[LANZ] Come on, Gil!
Mister Deborane almost had

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:16.376
his guild card
revoked because of her!

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:18.420
[GIL] Which also would
have been his own fault.

00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:19.337
[RULINA]
Calm down, Lanz.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.381
Um, I should probably go.

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:24.217
Miss Rulina, regarding
your latest quest...

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:28.013
I'm so sorry. We just
can't do it without Deborane.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.015
Unfortunately,
he was our only tank.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:33.143
Lanz and I can't protect Rulina
from attacks without him there.

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:35.103
Is it possible to
forfeit the quest?

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:37.814
Yes, it would be marked
as a completion failure.

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:39.316
‐‐[LANZ] Damn!
‐‐[RULINA] A failure?

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:41.526
Not good for our
future jobs and ratings.

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.528
Surely there's a clause
for canceling a quest

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.530
due to a missing party member!

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:47.490
[HELEN] I'm afraid not.
Those are the rules.

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:49.492
As such, the guild
can't change the result.

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:51.286
Have fun with all that.

00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:52.871
Okay then.

00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:55.373
Wait! You could always
ask Miss Yuna for help!

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:56.583
[YUNA]
Uh!

00:06:58.001 --> 00:06:59.419
What?

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.258
[YUNA] Listen, after
this I'm totally done

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.760
with that Deborane dude.

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.345
Right. I understand.

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:11.640
Good. So why are you
tagging along again?

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.808
I usually do these
sort of quests solo.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.936
Well, this was our party's
quest to begin with,

00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:17.562
plus it would be
irresponsible for us

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:19.481
to have you handle everything.

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:20.774
[YUNA]
She's way too sensible

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:22.984
to be hanging out with
a bunch of hotheads.

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:23.985
[RULINA] Will we be all right?

00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:25.862
This quest has over 50 goblins.

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:28.990
Please, that's like 50
Deboranes. It'll be easy.

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:30.742
They're goblins, not Deboranes!

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:33.078
A horde of them can
be a lot to handle.

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.955
A Deborane horde
sounds way gross.

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:37.290
Can you stop comparing
him to goblins, Yuna?!

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:39.250
Okay then, let's hunt goblins.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:41.169
I think you mean Deboranes‐‐ Uh!

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:43.254
[YUNA chuckles]

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:47.425
[YUNA]
Looks kinda far.

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.803
[RULINA] It'll take
a whole day, round trip.

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:51.262
[YUNA]
Hmm...

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.348
Guess we should hurry then.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.266
Uh, why do you look so scary?

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:57.268
What weird trick
are you about to pull?

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.980
You ask too many
questions, Rulina.

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:02.524
Please... no.

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:06.569
[yelps]

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:08.113
What the what?

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:11.324
You're gonna wanna
hold on tight.

00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:14.494
[RULINA screams]

00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:17.789
[RULINA]
Stop it, Yuna!

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:22.627
[RULINA gasping]
I told you to stop!

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.045
You didn't stop.

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:27.132
I've never gone
that fast in my life.

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:28.258
You pee your pants?

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:29.467
Absolutely not!

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.302
[YUNA]
Cool bears.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:33.847
So are you ready
to slay some goblins?

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:35.348
Yes.

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:44.149
We'll need to take care
of their guards first,

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.610
and we'll have to be
quiet so they don't hear us.

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:50.530
There's only a few outside.

00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:53.199
Hold up. Uh, there's
way more than 50.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:54.409
Maybe a hundred.

00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:57.829
What? I can't believe
there're so many of them!

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.457
Wait, how could you
possibly know that stuff?

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:01.708
I have a detection spell

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.836
that lets me know how
many monsters are around.

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:06.046
There's magic like that?!

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:07.172
[YUNA]
Air Cutter!

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:08.214
[GOBLINS shriek]

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:12.552
[RULINA]
Uh! Uh, oh, wait! Wait for me!

00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:14.596
Bear Fire, go!

00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:18.475
[YUNA]
Bear Wall!

00:09:19.851 --> 00:09:21.019
[YUNA]
That should do it.

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.312
What should do it?

00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:23.855
I threw in a bunch of fire magic

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:25.732
and sealed off
the cave's entrance.

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:27.484
The fire should eat up
all of their oxygen

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:29.778
and suffocate the goblins
that are still inside.

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.738
"Oxygen"? What does that mean?

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.740
[YUNA]
Uhh...

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:36.618
Just trust me, it's gonna
take care of our goblin problem.

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:37.577
[RULINA]
It will?

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:39.954
[YUNA] Yeah, we'll have
to wait a bit, though.

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:42.999
Do we have to
harvest those guys?

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:46.211
Yes, not all the parts, but we
definitely need the mana gems.

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:49.255
That's what serves as
our proof for hunting them.

00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:50.465
You didn't know?

00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:52.217
No, I'm still new to all this.

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:53.843
[RULINA]
Are you sure?

00:09:58.223 --> 00:09:59.933
Aren't you going to do it, too?

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:01.101
Nope. I can hunt,

00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:03.311
but don't know the first
thing about harvesting.

00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:06.064
Well, it's a good idea to
learn how to do it yourself.

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:07.982
I'm not interested.

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.612
Guess I'll do it...

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:17.575
[YUNA] Now I'm kinda
glad I brought her.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.120
I'm all done.

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:21.996
One goblin's
still alive in there.

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:23.540
[RULINA gasps]

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:25.250
[YUNA]
It's stronger than the others.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.627
No way! It might
be a Goblin King!

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:28.753
[YUNA gasps]

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:31.047
[YUNA]
WFO had a boss like that.

00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:33.967
It was a goblin that was smarter
and stronger than all the rest.

00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:35.385
Well, at least that explains why

00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:37.428
there were more goblins
than we first expected.

‐‐[rumbling]
‐‐[RULINA gasps]

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.723
[RULINA]
We should get some back‐up.

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:43.226
We can't take it
on all by ourselves!

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:45.311
[YUNA]
Cancel.

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:48.398
Yuna, what are you doing?!

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:50.191
It's just a Deborane
that's a bit strong.

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:51.985
It is way more than just a bit!

00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:53.736
Oh, because it's
a Deborane King?

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:55.572
Yes, that's exactly right! Uh!

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:57.866

[gasps]

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:09.377
I've got this, Rulina!

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:11.045
Air Cutter!

[groans]

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:31.441
It hit! Nice job!

00:11:31.482 --> 00:11:34.485
He's bleeding, but
I think I ticked him off.

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.237
[snarls]

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:37.780
Watch out, Yuna!

00:11:39.073 --> 00:11:41.492
[YUNA] Right now,
all his focus is on me,

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:43.661
so he'll never see
this next part coming.

[RULINA]
You actually beat him.

00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:01.930
[YUNA]
He was surprisingly strong.

00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:04.682
Should we extract the mana gem
from the Goblin King, too?

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:07.560
I think it would be better if
we took the corpse back with us.

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:09.979
Can you possibly fit him
inside of your item bag?

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:11.731
No problem.

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:15.526

Woo‐hoo, free sword.

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:20.823
Let's check on the rest.

H‐Hot!

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:26.329
[YUNA] Hmm... Forgot
the cave was still on fire.

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:27.914
Here.

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.042
Should be safe now.

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:32.418
Amazing!

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:37.340
How many goblins do
ya think were in there?

00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:38.216
[YUNA]
About a hundred.

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:40.677
Do you wanna help me
out with the harvesting?

00:12:40.718 --> 00:12:41.678
Not really.

00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:43.221
It'd go faster.

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:44.138
Still a no.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.807
And it's a great
time to learn how.

00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:46.641
Nope‐ty no.

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:47.850

Yuna...

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:50.937
Gimme an "N" to the "O"!

[RULINA sighs]

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:56.734
I am supposed to be a
magic caster, not a harvester.

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:05.618
[sighs] That took forever.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.578

Uh. Whoa! She's asleep?!

Did you make this
weird house, Yuna?!

00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:16.379
You wake up right now, missy!

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:18.464
Oh. It worked.

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:22.343
Don't go back to sleep!

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:24.554
[RULINA]
Hey, what were you doing?!

00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:26.597
Did you collect
all the mana gems?

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.933
[RULINA]
Yes, all 100 of them...

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:30.435
Hold on, did you
really make a house

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:31.894
while I worked my butt off?!

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.438
Well, yeah, I didn't
want to get interrupted

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:35.732
by monsters or animals
while I was taking a nap,

00:13:35.773 --> 00:13:39.027
so I made a little house
using some earth magic.

00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:39.736
[RULINA]
Sure, you did the...

00:13:39.777 --> 00:13:40.653
[YUNA]
This house was okay,

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:43.698
but I bet I could make one
that's a lot more comfortable.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.243
Next time, I'll build
one that's even better.

[RULINA gasps]

00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:56.836
No, I'm still a little tired
from all of the harvesting.

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:59.088
Then you can rest!

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.632
Not again. Please don't.

She's unstoppable!

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.399
[ADVENTURER 3D] Well, yeah,
she's the Bloody Bear!

00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:21.277
[YUNA] Bloody Bear seems
like a dark nickname.

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:26.532
[sighs] I've finished
confirming the results.

00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:28.993
There're a hundred and
ten goblin mana gems,

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:32.080
with a successful Goblin
King hunt to top it off.

00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:32.997
No way.

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:33.831
[GIL]
Mm.

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:36.000
I can also testify as a witness.

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:38.252
Yuna's abilities
are very impressive.

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:40.421
And she's much
stronger than Deborane.

Miss Yuna, if it's
all right by you,

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:46.177
can the guild possibly take
the Goblin King off your hands?

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:48.888
You want a gross
body? It's yours.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.556
So are we cool or what?

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:52.683
Huh? Yeah...

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:53.893
Good, then that settles it.

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:56.729
I'm done dealing with
Deborane's endless drama.

00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:58.981
[LANZ]
Hold on...

00:14:59.023 --> 00:15:00.817
Come on, what is it now?

00:15:00.858 --> 00:15:03.111
[LANZ]
Mmm...

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:06.197
Huh?

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:08.324
Look, I'm sorry
about everything.

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:10.827
Thanks for helping us
with our goblin quest.

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:13.913
If I'd known there was a king,
I would have gone, too.

00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:16.833
Thank you for protecting
Rulina in our stead.

00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:17.917
[YUNA]
Uh...

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:19.419
Thank you.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.713
Huh? Uh‐huh...

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:26.217
[YUNA] I wasn't expecting
that, but it was kinda nice.

00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:34.100
[YUNA] I got some new skills
after slaying the Goblin King.

00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:36.018
I should try them out.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.603
Go!

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:43.609
[YUNA]
Hold up, you're my summon beast?

[KUMAYURU squeaks]

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:51.284

You're, like, really big.

[KUMAYURU]
Kuma!

00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:56.706
[YUNA]
Uh.

00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:00.793
[KUMAYURU]
Mm...

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:02.879
[YUNA]
That's a good bear.

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:08.176
[YUNA]
Huh? You want me to ride you?

00:16:08.217 --> 00:16:10.470
[KUMAYURU grunts]

00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:12.054
'Kay, here we go.

00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:13.347
Is this all right for you?

[YUNA yelps]

00:16:15.933 --> 00:16:18.686
[YUNA]
Wait, I didn't fall?

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:21.898
Cool. Is it because
you're my summon?

00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:24.734
I guess... let's walk
around for a bit.

00:16:24.775 --> 00:16:26.527
[KUMAYURU]
Mm!

00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:31.365
Whoa! This is kinda nice!

00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:33.117
Can you go any faster?

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:34.952
Kuma!

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.291
[YUNA] Uh, uhh. No matter
what, I can't fall off.

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:42.335
Let's see!

00:16:42.376 --> 00:16:43.920
It's super soft.

00:16:43.961 --> 00:16:47.507
I could probably even
sleep while traveling.

00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:51.219
A bear summon beast.
This, I like.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.430

Nice! Good bear.

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:56.974
[KUMAYURU squeaks]

00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:58.893
[YUNA gasps]

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:01.562
[YUNA] I didn't really come
out to hunt today, but...

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:03.481
[BOAR growls]

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:05.775
Oh, well, let's do this.

00:17:05.816 --> 00:17:07.109
Uh?

00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:08.861
Are you gonna fight it for me?

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:10.530
[KUMAYURU grunts]

00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:17.036
[KUMAYURU grunts]

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:22.208
Huh? That's a bear punch!

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.668
Kuma!

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:25.503
[YUNA] I've got a handle
on the summon beast thing,

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:28.005
so I should probably head back.

00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:30.466
Huh? One per puppet?

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:32.051
Go!

00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:36.722
[YUNA]
Cool, this one has white fur!

00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:38.349
What the...?

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:41.143
[YUNA]
Wait, is it sulking?

00:17:41.185 --> 00:17:44.564
Maybe it's jealous that
I only rode the other one.

00:17:44.605 --> 00:17:46.607
I'm sorry, it wasn't on
purpose or anything,

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:49.360
I didn't even
know you were there!

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:52.363
I'm serious! I feel terrible
about the whole thing!

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:55.866
I know! What if I ride you
on the way back to town?

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:58.869
I'm sure that would
make you happy... right?

00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:01.205
[KUMAKYU groans]

00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:05.209
Kuma!

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:07.044
[sighs] That better?

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:11.215
Oh, yeah. I guess I should
give you guys some names, huh?

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:12.592
What would work?

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:15.636
Let's see, bear names.

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:20.433
This one is Kumayuru.

00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:23.477
And the white one is Kumakyu.

00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:25.688
Oh, they're real bears.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.481
[BOTH]
Kuma!

00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:28.858
They're so cute.

00:18:28.899 --> 00:18:30.943
Aren't they?
And on top of being cute,

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:33.154
they're both super strong!

00:18:33.195 --> 00:18:35.740
Wow. That's handy.

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:42.997
[FINA] Nice to meet you,
Kumakyu, Kumayuru!

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:44.290
[BOTH squeak]

00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:46.917
[FINA giggles]

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:51.505
[YUNA]
I feel like a big sister kinda.

00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:06.979
I was able to get a lot
of hunting done today

00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:08.272
thanks to Kumayuru and Kumakyu.

00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:11.317
Yeah. And I found some
herbs for my mom, too!

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:14.236
Oh! We better hurry back
so I can do the harvesting.

00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:16.614
Oh. Wait a sec, that reminds me.

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:19.617
I think I found a
solution to our problem.

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:20.910
Huh?

00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:28.167
Thanks for visiting
the merchant's guild!

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:31.587
So what type of business can
I help you ladies with today?

00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:33.214
[YUNA]
I'd like to rent some land.

00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:36.217
Right. Give me just
a moment please.

00:19:36.258 --> 00:19:39.553
[YUNA] At least she didn't
shoot me any weird looks.

00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:41.847
Finally, a professional.

00:19:41.889 --> 00:19:43.808
[MILAINE]
Here's what we currently have.

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:45.267
The land is a bit more expensive

00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:47.019
the closer you are
to the center of town,

00:19:47.061 --> 00:19:49.230
but that's the
cost of convenience.

00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:51.816
[YUNA] I'd like to get something
closer to Fina's house.

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:53.025
Plus, it'd be nice and quiet

00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:56.195
since there probably wouldn't be
as many people around.

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:57.613
[YUNA] It seems like
this is a good spot.

00:19:57.655 --> 00:19:58.781
Is the price negotiable?

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:00.908
What do you plan to
use the land for?

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.159
I'm building a house.

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:05.663
Excuse me for asking, but you
are the Bloody Bear, right?

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:06.539
[YUNA]
Hm.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.125
[gasps]

00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:11.460
[MILAINE clears throat]
Please pardon my outburst.

00:20:11.502 --> 00:20:13.879
I meant, you're the
adventurer, Yuna.

00:20:13.921 --> 00:20:15.464
Yep, that's my name.

00:20:15.506 --> 00:20:17.216
We're so appreciative
of the materials

00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:18.467
you bring in from monsters,

00:20:18.509 --> 00:20:20.386
like the Goblin King
and Tiger Wolves.

00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:22.012
And as a member of
the merchant's guild,

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:23.931
I'd like to
thank you personally.

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:25.015
I don't really get it.

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:27.226
Why would the merchant's
guild wanna thank me?

00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:29.478
Oh, it's probably because
the merchant's guild

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.730
is used to sell items that are

00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:32.106
obtained by the
adventurer's guild.

00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:33.482
She's absolutely right.

00:20:33.524 --> 00:20:35.776
As such, we're always
sure to keep a close eye

00:20:35.818 --> 00:20:37.778
on any noteworthy adventurers.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.197
Now, as for the land
purchase in question,

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:43.617
I can actually use my authority
to lower the price more for you.

00:20:43.659 --> 00:20:44.869
Whoa, for real?

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.662
[MILAINE]
When work goes smoothly for you,

00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:48.372
you're sure to bring
in more materials,

00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:50.124
and that benefits
the merchant's guild.

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:52.501
I get it, so we'd
be helping each other.

00:20:52.543 --> 00:20:55.337
That's right. Many people
want to get closer to you.

00:20:55.379 --> 00:20:56.630
And I'm not ashamed to say that

00:20:56.672 --> 00:20:58.674
I happen to be
one of those people.

00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:00.134
Closer to me?

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:01.844
I'm sorry for the
late introduction.

00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:03.429
My name is Milaine.

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:05.014
Now then, let's make a deal.

00:21:05.055 --> 00:21:09.393
[YUNA gasps]
Uh, uhh...

00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:12.897
Uh, yeah. Sounds good.

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:15.649
I promise this will benefit you.

00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:19.612
[YUNA] Milaine certainly
knows how to run a business.

00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:21.030
I'll give her that.

00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:23.157
She's just a very
forward person.

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:24.325
I can see that.

00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:26.285
Anyway, how 'bout
we build a house?

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:27.828
‐‐[FINA] Whoa, really?
‐‐[YUNA] Mm‐hm!

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:30.164
You might wanna stand back.

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:35.336
[YUNA] What things
do you need in a house?

00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:39.632
A kitchen, bath,
toilet, bedroom...

00:21:40.883 --> 00:21:42.426
[YUNA]
What else?

00:21:44.136 --> 00:21:45.721
[YUNA]
Oh. I should probably have

00:21:45.763 --> 00:21:47.807
a good bear image in my head.

00:21:50.434 --> 00:21:52.144
[YUNA yells]

00:21:54.188 --> 00:21:57.024
[FINA gasps]
Wha‐‐?!

00:22:00.236 --> 00:22:02.613
This will be my house
from here on out!

00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:04.406
Come inside!

00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:06.450
I made you a harvesting room!

00:22:06.492 --> 00:22:07.827
[gasps]

00:22:08.911 --> 00:22:11.413
So will you keep
helping me, Fina?

00:22:11.455 --> 00:22:14.542
[FINA gasps]

00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:16.377
Yes!

00:23:52.598 --> 00:23:55.017
[KUMAYURU]
Kuma! Kuma!
