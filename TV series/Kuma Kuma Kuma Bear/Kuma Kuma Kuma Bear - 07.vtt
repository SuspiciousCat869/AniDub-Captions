00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:13.847
[NOIR]
You're late, Miss Yuna!

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.099
[YUNA] You could have
waited inside the house.

00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:17.142
That's true.

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:19.394
Noa was so excited
about going on this trip

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:21.063
that she wanted to
wait outside for you.

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:22.898
You are embarrassing me!

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.025
[CLIFF chuckles]

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:26.902
Anyway, I still have
quite a bit of work

00:00:26.944 --> 00:00:28.278
that I need to finish up here.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.655
But I'll be sure
to make it in time

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.199
for His Majesty's
birthday celebration.

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:33.158
[YUNA]
Mm.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.744
Don't you worry; I'll get
Noa there safely for sure.

00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:38.288
I appreciate that.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.248
So who's this?

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.959
A friend of mine that
I'd like to bring with me.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.377
Uh, hello, my lord!

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:45.337
And you as well, Lady Noir!

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.714
It's such an honor
to meet both of thew!

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:48.382
‐‐[YUNA] "Thew"?

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:48.799
‐‐[CLIFF] "Thew"?!
‐‐[YUNA] "Thew"?

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.759
‐‐[CLIFF] "Thew"?!
‐‐[NOIR] She bit her tongue!

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:54.179
I don't mind if she goes.
I'm sure Noa would be happy to

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:55.889
have another girl
her age on the trip.

00:00:55.931 --> 00:00:57.391
Stop everything!

00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:58.308
Listen up!

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.351
Uh, yes, ma'am?

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:01.812
I refuse to give up
my spot on the bear!

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:02.729
[FINA gasps]

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:04.606
Do you understand me?

00:01:04.648 --> 00:01:06.942
Uh! [gasps]

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:43.497
[NOIR] How silly.
I forgot there're two bears.

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:44.665
I'm sorry.

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:46.833
There's no need
for you to apologize.

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:49.252
I should thank you for
letting me have the front seat.

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:51.171
Oh, and please be careful.

00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:52.589
I don't want you to fall off.

00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:53.882
Uh, right.

00:02:53.924 --> 00:02:56.009
So, uh, you are?

00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:57.928
You can just call
me Fina, Lady Noir.

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.056
'Kay. I'm looking forward
to traveling with you.

00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:03.934
And the same goes for me;
it'll be a lot of fun!

00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:06.770
Yep! 'Cause Kumayuru's
with us, right?

00:03:06.812 --> 00:03:08.105
Kuma!

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:09.606
‐‐[NOIR laughs]
‐‐[FINA] So, uh...

00:03:09.648 --> 00:03:13.318
I take it you've met Kumayuru
and Kumakyu before, Lady Noir?

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.278
Indeed! I've ridden on them both

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.614
and then, we took an
afternoon nap together!

00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:20.951
And now I get to travel all the
way to the capital with them!

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:22.953
Dreams do come true!

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:24.746
[YUNA] They seem to
be getting along well.

00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:25.872
That's good.

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:27.249
Uh?

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:35.841
[WOLF yelps]

00:03:37.426 --> 00:03:41.138
Way to go, Miss Yuna! You're
as strong as everyone says!

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:42.723
I'll harvest them
when we get home.

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:44.391
That'd be great.

00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:45.392
[NOIR]
Harvest?

00:03:45.434 --> 00:03:48.520
Um, how exactly do you
two know each other again?

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:50.397
Well, Fina actually
came to my rescue

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:51.732
when I was lost in the forest.

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:53.692
No way, if anyone
did any rescuing,

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:56.528
it was Yuna. I'd be wolf chow
if it weren't for her!

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.363
I can't harvest the
monsters I defeat,

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:00.282
so she helps out
by doing it for me.

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:01.491
Yuna goes hunting a lot,

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:03.660
so there's always plenty
of work for me to do.

00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:05.162
I'm so thankful to her.

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:07.205
Hold on.
Wait for just a second.

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:10.125
I need a moment to process. Ahh!

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:12.043
So you two are close friends?

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:12.961
Yep.

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.171
Sure are.

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:16.757
Then, are you saying that
you've actually traveled

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.884
with Kumayuru
and Kumakyu before?

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.093
Yes, a few times.

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:25.849
[NOIR gasps, screams]

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:29.436
[FINA] Lady Noir!
Is something the matter?

00:04:29.478 --> 00:04:30.312
Hey, Fina!

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:31.188
[FINA]
Yes?

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.940
I hereby declare you as
my rival for the bears!

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:35.942
Or, to make it more simple,

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:38.653
you are my bear rival!

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:39.613
What?

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:42.240
[YUNA]
It was already pretty simple.

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:46.119
Did you know that both
my mother and older sister

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:47.537
live in the royal capital?

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:50.248
My mother works in the castle
alongside the king himself

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.126
and my sister excels in her
studies at the Royal Academy.

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:54.377
How impressive!

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.171
Yes, I'm very proud of them.

00:04:56.213 --> 00:04:58.548
Is this your first visit
to the royal capital, Fina?

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.382
Yes.

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:02.469
His Majesty's birthday
celebration is quite the affair!

00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:04.805
Different people from around
the kingdom come to visit,

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:06.640
so it will be rather lively.

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:07.849
[FINA]
It sounds fun!

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:08.767
It is!

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:11.853
Once we get to the capital,
I'll show you around a little!

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:14.731
Kumayuru, Kumakyu.
Stop right here.

00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:16.775
Let's call it a day and rest.

00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:18.610
[FINA]
Okay!

00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:20.278
[NOIR]
So will we be camping?

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.489
I have slept in the
carriage on my previous trips.

00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:24.449
But never in a tent!

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:25.700
[NOIR yelps]

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:27.911
Here we have the
Travel‐Size Bear House.

00:05:27.953 --> 00:05:31.540
[NOIR] How'd you do
that? It's incredible!

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:34.042
Promise you'll keep knowledge
of the Bear House to yourself.

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:37.003
It would be a huge hassle if
too many other people found out.

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.256
Right. It's our secret.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:43.218
[gasps, giggles]

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.886
[YUNA]
Take your shoes off, please.

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:46.471
[NOIR]
Will do!

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:47.931
[NOIR giggles]

00:05:47.973 --> 00:05:50.016
[NOIR]
The inside is beautiful, too!

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:52.477
Okay, I'm gonna
go cook dinner now.

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:53.520
I'll help, as well!

00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:54.938
Oh! Allow me!

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.440
It's okay.
I really enjoy cooking.

00:05:57.482 --> 00:05:59.818
Right. Doin' the thing!

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:04.781
[NOIR gasps]

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:06.116
[YUNA]
Dig in before it gets cold.

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:08.076
'Kay. Thanks, Yuna!

00:06:08.118 --> 00:06:10.453
Yes. Thank you for the meal.

[NOIR gasps]

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:24.759
[NOIR grunting]

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:28.096
Ahh! Wow, this is so yummy!

00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:30.265
What is this
delicious food called?

00:06:30.307 --> 00:06:31.600
[YUNA]
Hamburg steak.

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.768
Um, hamburg what?

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:34.811
[YUNA]
It's ground up meat.

00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:37.689
You shape it into patties,
cook it, and voila.

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:39.733
[FINA]
It's as delicious as last time!

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:41.568
Do you think I could
learn how to make it?

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.445
Sure, I can probably teach you.

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:45.196
You're too kind to me, Yuna!

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.656
Teach me, too!

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:48.575
Why would you need to
learn how to make it, Noa?

00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:51.286
I mean, you're a noble, so don't
other people make your food?

00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:52.829
Yes, usually.

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:56.124
But I could still learn. I don't
wanna be the only one left out!

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:57.542
Well, if you insist.

00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:00.629
I can teach you guys to make it
when we get back to town, okay?

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.047

[BOTH]
Uhh...

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:20.982
Uh...

00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:23.526
Thanks so much for your
assistance, young lady.

00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:25.070
[YUNA] He was totally
gonna say something

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:26.988
about my outfit
but bailed on it.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.532
[MISANA] Yes, we're so grateful
you came along when you did.

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:30.867
Are you a bear?

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:32.369
Obviously not.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.871
Hello, Lord Gran! Hi, Misa!

00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:38.375
If it isn't Miss Noir!
You've grown so much bigger!

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:39.709
Well, it's been a while!

00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:41.127
Hello, my dear Noa!

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.588
I haven't seen you in forever!

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.299
[YUNA] "My dear."
What a cute sentiment.

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:47.133
[NOIR]
Oh, yeah.

00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:49.844
These two are Count Gran
and his granddaughter, Misana.

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:51.972
I'm Yuna, an adventurer.

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:54.933
Miss Yuna's currently escorting
me to the royal capital.

00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:57.560
Wait, hold on.
Your father isn't with you?

00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:59.938
No, Father had some
work he needed to finish,

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.774
so he sent me ahead to the
capital with Miss Yuna instead.

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:05.360
Are you going to the king's
birthday celebration?

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:06.820
Yes. Are you two?

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:07.988
We are!

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:10.240
[GRAN] You seem to possess
a great deal of strength.

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:12.367
Enough to protect these
two children at least.

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:15.829
Would you perhaps like to
travel to the capital together?

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.247
Sorry, it's nice of you to ask,

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:18.832
but I think I'll
have to decline.

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:20.041
[YUNA]
Too much work.

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:21.876
I'd be more than
happy to pay you.

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:24.629
Uh, didn't you bring your
own escorts along for the trip?

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.798
Yes, but it's extremely
uncommon for monsters

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.591
to be this close to
the royal capital,

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:31.553
so it's best to
be overly prepared.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.638
[YUNA sighs]
This is un‐bear‐lievable.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.557
[NOIR]
Miss Yuna!

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:38.601
May we travel
together with Misa?

00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:41.938
Well, if we do that,

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.024
then it means we can't
use the Bear House.

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:45.817
Ah! Right, that's true!

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.402
And there goes
the nice, fluffy bed.

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:52.073
Ah! The Bear House, fluffy bed,
the Bear House, fluffy bed.

00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:54.492
Bear House, fluffy bed...

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:55.785
[FINA]
What's the matter?

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:58.288
It's a lot easier to
travel with only three people.

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:00.582
But since Cliff's the one
that hired me initially,

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:02.959
I'm going to ultimately
leave the decision up to Noa.

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:05.754
Bear House, fluffy bed!
What should I do?

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:07.797
Gah! Okay, that's it!

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:09.883
We shall travel
together with Misa!

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:12.177
I'm looking forward
to it, Lady Bear!

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:15.221
Same. But, please,
just call me Yuna.

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:44.667
[YUNA gasps]

00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:52.092
[YUNA] Looks like we're finally
here. Took long enough.

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:54.219
The royal capital!

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:03.186
[WOMAN 7A]
It's a bear.

00:10:03.228 --> 00:10:04.646
[MAN 7A]
A bear is riding a bear.

00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:06.314
[MAN 7B] Why is there
a bear in the royal capital?

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:07.941
[WOMAN 7B]
They're so cute!

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:11.236
[YUNA] I haven't experienced
this reaction in a while.

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:12.987
[GRAN] Thank you for
taking care of us, Yuna.

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:14.114
[YUNA]
It was no problem.

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:17.367
Bye, my dearest Noa, Miss Fina.
We should all play later!

00:10:17.408 --> 00:10:18.201
Yeah!

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:20.411
Please come visit any time.

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:25.333
[NOIR giggles]

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:27.919
Right, allow me
to show you around.

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:31.422
[ALL gasp]

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.424
[ELLELAURA]
You're finally here!

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.051
Noa!

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:36.636
Hi! Mother!

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:37.846
I missed you!

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:38.847
[ELLELAURA]
I missed you more!

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:39.889
[YUNA]
That's her mom?

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:42.142
[NOIR] Come now, Mother,
you're making such a fuss!

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:45.562
Besides, you haven't met
Miss Yuna or Fina yet.

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:47.397
Miss Yuna?

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:50.984
[ELLELAURA grunts]
A bear?!

00:10:51.025 --> 00:10:52.068
[NOIR sighs]

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.320
That's Noa's mom? Wow.

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.406
[YUNA]
So young!

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.908
[ELLELAURA] Thank you
for escorting my daughter

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.118
here safely.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.744
My name is Ellelaura.

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:03.997
I'm the wife of
Cliff Foschurose.

00:11:04.038 --> 00:11:05.707
I'm Yuna. I'm an adventurer.

00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:08.501
Nice to meet you.
My name's Fina.

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:11.087
Fina is my rival for
the bear's attention!

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:12.922
I see. That's nice, dear.

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:15.258
Wait, I thought you
shortened it to bear rival.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.969
Oh! That's correct.
Fina is my bear rival!

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:19.971
I see. That's nice, dear.

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:21.890
[YUNA]
Man, she's one chill mom.

00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:24.058
Mother? Don't you
have work today?

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.769
Once the guards told me you had
arrived safely in the capital,

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:28.521
I just couldn't wait to see you.

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:30.481
[YUNA]
So she just ditched work?

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:31.733
My Lady, before I forget,

00:11:31.774 --> 00:11:34.152
I have something here
for you from Lord Cliff.

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:36.988
[ELLELAURA]
You do? What could it be?

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.157
[YUNA] It's the gift he
wants you to give His Majesty‐‐

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:41.201
the sword of a goblin king.

00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:43.995
Also, there's a letter, too.

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:50.877
So this present... You were
the one who gave it to Cliff.

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:51.836
Thank you.

00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:54.297
[YUNA]
Oh. It's fine, My Lady.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:58.092
Is there a problem?

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:00.053
Please don't be so formal.

00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:04.140
Lighten up a bit. You can speak
normally around our family.

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:05.183
You sure?

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:06.017
Indeed!

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:08.061
It says so right
here in this letter.

00:12:08.102 --> 00:12:09.729
"Do not make her your enemy."

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:10.563
Huh?

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:13.066
It says, "Don't
anger her." And then,

00:12:13.107 --> 00:12:15.860
"Yuna will cause trouble, so
please handle the aftermath."

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:17.278
Oh. Wow.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.738
Jeez, his letter
makes it sound like

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.531
I'm some kind
of walking disaster.

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:23.660
Perhaps, but it also says that
you are a very caring adventurer

00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:25.954
and that Noa
happens to adore you.

00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:30.416
I find myself
interested in you as well.

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:32.627
Will you please tell me
more about yourself?

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:33.962
Well, uh...

00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:36.798
Believe me, Mother!
Miss Yuna is really amazing!

00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:39.175
She defeated entire
packs of wolves and orcs

00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:40.551
on the way to the royal capital,

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:42.428
and she didn't even
break a sweat doing it!

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.638
My!

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.599
Both of her bear summons
are simply adorable!

00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:48.059
And they're very well behaved!

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:49.936
When you ride them,
you won't ever fall off and

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:52.063
their backs are
really warm and fluffy!

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:53.273
[YUNA]
With the way she's gushing,

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:56.359
I can tell Noa was
excited to see her mom.

00:12:56.401 --> 00:13:00.738
But I kinda wish it
wasn't all about me.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.949
[YUNA]
Hmm...

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:05.201
[SHIA]
Mother, I'm home!

00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:06.828
I heard Noa arrived earlier?

00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:07.662
[gasps]

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:09.747
Hello, Shia!

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:12.333
[SHIA]
Noa! Is that a bear?

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:13.459
[ELLELAURA]
Welcome home, sweetie.

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:16.379
Ah, do something!
Noa's in danger!

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:19.257
Wait, there's two
bears? [whimpers]

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:21.551
Now, Mother! Noa,
that's dangerous!

00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:23.136
Please get off those things!

00:13:23.177 --> 00:13:25.138
[ELLELAURA] How rude.
They're not dangerous at all.

00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:26.639
And they're not
"things," either.

00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:29.309
[NOIR] Mother's right!
They're actually quite friendly!

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:33.438
Uh, what? Those are
treacherous beasts!

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:37.317
[SHIA screams]
Wait! There's a third bear?!

00:13:38.359 --> 00:13:39.152
[SHIA]
You're telling me

00:13:39.193 --> 00:13:42.071
the girl in the silly
outfit was Noa's escort?

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:43.364
[ELLELAURA]
You're being rude again.

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:46.492
That's Yuna and
she's an adventurer.

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:49.495
This is Shia and
she's Noa's older sister.

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:50.621
[YUNA]
Ah.

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:52.457
You cannot be serious.

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:55.543
I refuse to believe that a kid
like her is a real adventurer!

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:57.420
[YUNA]
By "kid," does she mean me?

00:13:57.462 --> 00:13:58.671
Enough, Shia.

00:13:58.713 --> 00:14:00.882
She may be young,
but she's very strong!

00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:02.717
[YUNA]
I'm feeling kind of attacked.

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.844
Not to mention, she's adorable!

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:06.763
[YUNA]
Why does that matter?

00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:08.514
[SHIA]
Sorry, but I'm not buying it.

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:11.476
I just can't take a girl
in a bear suit seriously.

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:13.019
[YUNA] Well, your
disbelief doesn't make me

00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:14.520
any less capable.

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:16.939
[ELLELAURA] I've got it.
How about a little test?

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:18.358
[SHIA, YUNA gasp]

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:26.324
Miss Yuna! Best
of luck out there!

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:28.117
You've got this
in the bag, Shia!

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:30.620
Ugh, how'd we end up out here?

00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:32.205
Whatever, let's do this.

00:14:32.246 --> 00:14:34.207
Just don't hold back, okay?

00:14:34.248 --> 00:14:35.958
And we leave our
feelings in the ring.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.126
Of course!

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:38.544
Are you two ready?

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:40.129
Then, go!

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:43.216
[SHIA yells]

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:48.471
[YUNA] In WFO, there were a lot
of players who fought like her.

00:14:48.513 --> 00:14:51.974
People who relied
on brute strength.

00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:55.603
Too slow! [gasps]

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:56.896
[YUNA]
And they always leap at

00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:59.816
the very first
opening they can find.

00:15:04.695 --> 00:15:07.073
[grunts]

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:09.534
It looks like I'm the winner.

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:15.915
[SHIA]
Hey! Wait just a moment!

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:16.749
What now?

00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:18.459
Please, I'm not finished!

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:20.169
Let's spar again!

00:15:21.337 --> 00:15:23.297
It'd be my pleasure.

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:26.884
[yelling]

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:32.014
[SHIA grunting]

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.315
[ELLELAURA]
Do you understand now?

00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:43.067
This bear girl is quite strong.

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:44.277
[SHIA]
Mother.

00:15:44.318 --> 00:15:46.446
Yes. Though I never
thought I'd lose to

00:15:46.487 --> 00:15:48.030
someone younger than me.

00:15:48.072 --> 00:15:51.159
Oh, come to think of it,
just how old are you, Yuna?

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.368
[YUNA]
I'm 15.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:55.413
[SHIA yells]
We're the same age?!

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:58.249
I guess.

00:15:58.291 --> 00:15:59.959
I apologize.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.586
[ELLELAURA] Shia is one
of the strongest children

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:03.504
at the school she attends.

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:05.214
To be honest, I've
been worried about her

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:07.925
because she was getting
a bit overconfident.

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.343
That's why you had us spar?

00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:10.178
[ELLELAURA]
There's always someone

00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:11.888
more skilled than you out there.

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:14.390
I thought it was an
important lesson to learn.

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:16.893
Gotta say, don't appreciate
being used like that.

00:16:16.934 --> 00:16:19.645
[ELLELAURA giggles]
Okay!

00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:21.898
Anyone want a little snack?

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:31.157
[ELLELAURA squeals]
So good!

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:33.409
Oh, this treat is
called "poopin," right?

00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:34.285
[YUNA]
It's "pudding."

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:36.787
Right, of course!
I was just testing you!

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:41.751
Well, regardless,
it tastes divine!

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:44.086
There's no need to
make such a huge scene.

00:16:44.128 --> 00:16:46.088
I doubt that this treat
is any better than the foods

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.382
we're accustomed to eating.

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:54.889
[SHIA grunting]
Delicious!

00:16:57.016 --> 00:17:01.229
[YUNA] The same reaction.
Now I see the relation.

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:04.857
[YUNA] I was thinking
this might be a good chance

00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:06.567
to explore the capital a bit.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:08.611
Too bad Noa can't come.

00:17:08.653 --> 00:17:10.029
She said that she and her family

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:12.406
had a duty to greet
the other incoming nobles.

00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:14.075
They're all very busy.

00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:16.285
Oh, well, we'll just
explore by ourselves.

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:18.454
Right! [chuckles]

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.340
[YUNA]
I can't get over how big it is.

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:33.302
I've never seen so many people.
It makes me feel kinda dizzy.

00:17:33.344 --> 00:17:36.389
[YUNA]
That's a royal capital for you.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.140
Yeah. I guess so.

00:17:38.182 --> 00:17:41.602
Let's take a quick break.
Maybe some food will help.

00:17:43.187 --> 00:17:45.147
[sniffing]

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:48.192
Thank you so much.
Please visit us again!

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:50.152
Have a wonderful day!

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.074
Amazing!

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:57.702
Oh, wow. I've never
eaten bread this soft!

00:17:57.743 --> 00:18:00.246
I just followed my nose
and we hit the jackpot.

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:03.082
We should definitely go there
again while we're in town.

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:05.376
Now that I think about it,
when I took Cliff the pudding,

00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:06.794
he mentioned that
the royal capital

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:09.505
had all kinds of
really delicious food.

00:18:09.547 --> 00:18:11.215
You wanna go
check out the market?

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:12.758
[FINA]
Mm‐hm, mm‐hm!

00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:22.018
[YUNA]
Hey.

00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:23.853
Uh, what's wrong, Yuna?

00:18:23.894 --> 00:18:25.855
[VENDOR 7A] Welcome to
my stall, Little Bear.

00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:27.857
Um, are these things potatoes?

00:18:27.898 --> 00:18:29.650
You really know your stuff.

00:18:29.692 --> 00:18:32.403
Potatoes can be very delicious,
but they're also poisonous

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:34.030
if you don't cook them properly.

00:18:34.071 --> 00:18:35.990
[YUNA]
I'll take 'em!

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:38.492
Huh?

00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:40.244
[YUNA] She told me which
village she bought them from,

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:42.496
so now I can go get
some anytime I want!

00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:44.832
Yeah, but didn't she
also say they're poisonous?

00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:45.750
Sounds scary.

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:49.629
Nah, all you gotta do is
remove the sprouts. [gasps]

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.130
Hold on, is that cheese?

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:53.090
Yes. You have a sharp eye.

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:55.343
Most folks around here
don't know what cheese is,

00:18:55.384 --> 00:18:58.012
and then they try to
accuse me of selling mold!

00:18:58.054 --> 00:19:00.931
They refuse to give
my cheese a fair chance.

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:02.892
[YUNA]
Load me up!

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:04.268
Huh?

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.937
[FINA] Can you actually eat
moldy things like that?

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:09.023
Trust me, it's
totally safe to eat.

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:10.983
I'm a little surprised
that potatoes and cheese

00:19:11.025 --> 00:19:13.861
aren't more well known
in the royal capital though.

00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:16.072
Well, Lady Noir did say
that people from all over

00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:19.784
the kingdom travel here for His
Majesty's birthday celebration.

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:22.870
[YUNA] Oh, so these things
came from other places then.

00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:24.580
Which means...

00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:28.167
[YUNA gasps] Um, I'm gonna
go do some more shopping!

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:31.170
[FINA grunts, gasps]

00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:35.841
[YUNA] May I present:
hamburgers and french fries.

00:19:35.883 --> 00:19:37.551
Hambur...?

00:19:37.593 --> 00:19:39.762
These yellow things
are french fries?

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:43.349
It's the hamburg steak in
between two pieces of bread!

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:45.476
Yep! When you put
it in between bread,

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:47.186
then it becomes a hamburger.

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:48.729
Well? Dig in, you guys!

00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:51.440
[SHIA, ELLELAURA stammering]

00:19:51.482 --> 00:19:52.942
What's the best way to cut it?

00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:55.152
How are you supposed to
eat this thing with a fork?

00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:56.946
Oh, you just pick
it up, like this.

00:19:56.987 --> 00:19:59.031
[SHIA, ELLELAURA scream]

00:19:59.073 --> 00:20:01.325
[BOTH]
No way! It's too improper!

00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:03.536
It's poor manners
not to use utensils!

00:20:03.577 --> 00:20:04.370
[FINA gulps]

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.038
[SHIA, ELLELAURA]
Huh?

00:20:08.332 --> 00:20:09.959
Well? It's tasty, right?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.461
Yes! It's delicious!

00:20:12.503 --> 00:20:14.797
Hey! Just what are
you doing, Noa?

00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:16.549
Your hands! How rude!

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.385
Ahh! Not you, too, Mother!

[ELLELAURA, NOA gasp, squeal]

00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:25.891
Wow, it's so yummy!

00:20:25.933 --> 00:20:27.351
[ELLELAURA]
The meat is delectable!

00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:28.769
But what's this yellow stuff?

00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:29.812
That's cheese.

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:31.897
It's made using milk
and then melted on top.

00:20:31.939 --> 00:20:34.358
I see! I'm surprised
at how well the cheese

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.736
compliments the meat patty!

00:20:37.778 --> 00:20:40.239
This behavior is
beyond disgraceful!

00:20:40.281 --> 00:20:43.993
This strange food...
is absolutely not something

00:20:44.034 --> 00:20:47.747
that you two should be making
such an enormous fuss over!

00:20:47.788 --> 00:20:51.751
[SHIA grunting]

00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:53.502
It's amazing!

00:20:54.545 --> 00:20:56.464
[YUNA]
She's sold.

00:20:56.505 --> 00:20:58.758
Now that I have some cheese,
I could totally make a pizza!

00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:00.384
[GROUP]
Pizza?

00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:02.678
Basically you roll out dough
that's made from flour.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.263
Then you top it with
all kinds of things,

00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:06.515
like tomato sauce,
cheese, or whatever else.

00:21:06.557 --> 00:21:10.102
Then you bake it, and the dough
turns into a golden brown crust.

00:21:10.144 --> 00:21:12.688
But it's the melted cheese
that really sells it.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:15.149
Too bad it's such
a pain to make.

00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:16.984
I wanna eat it.

00:21:17.026 --> 00:21:18.778
Yes, me, too.

00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:20.654
Uh, please count me in.

00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:22.406
[GROUP]
Pizza.

00:21:22.448 --> 00:21:24.825
Will you make it for us, Yuna?

00:21:24.867 --> 00:21:27.328
Uh... All right, fine.

00:21:27.369 --> 00:21:28.996
I can make it tomorrow.

00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:30.372
[ALL giggle]

00:21:30.414 --> 00:21:31.999
Thanks so much, Miss Yuna!

00:21:32.041 --> 00:21:33.751
I can't wait to try it!

00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:34.752
Me either!

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:37.588
Since you're capable of making
such wonderful tasting food,

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.799
have you ever thought
about opening a restaurant?

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.633
Huh?

00:21:40.674 --> 00:21:44.094
[NOIR] You should! I bet
it would be very popular!

00:21:44.136 --> 00:21:46.472
[YUNA]
A restaurant, huh?

00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:50.100
[MILAINE] Amazing!
This would definitely sell!

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:53.646
Miss Yuna, why don't
you open a restaurant?

00:21:53.687 --> 00:21:56.357
[YUNA] Miss Milaine said
something similar back then.

00:21:56.398 --> 00:22:00.569
But to be honest, that's
not really part of my plan.

00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:03.906
Cooking just wouldn't be as
enjoyable if it were my job.

00:22:03.948 --> 00:22:06.617
Ya know, I definitely
prefer eating.

00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:08.202
Bear‐lieve me.
