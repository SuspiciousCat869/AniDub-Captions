WEBVTT

00:00:19.937 --> 00:00:22.397
[GHOULZAM] What's wrong
with using criminals?

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.568
You're all fools who hinder
the progress of science!

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.905
I will be sure
to settle this score!

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:38.163
I swear it‐‐no matter
how many years it may take!

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.138
Voila!

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.806
[GROUP gasps]

00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:21.433
[MISANA]
It smells so good!

00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:23.018
[NOIR]
How are we supposed to eat this?

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.020
[YUNA] It's perfectly
acceptable to use your hands!

00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:27.147
But it's still pretty hot,
so be careful.

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.317
[MISANA] So yummy! I especially
love the ooey‐gooey cheese!

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.070
[ELLALAURA] There you are! I was
wondering where you girls were.

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:34.112
What is that?

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.156
[NOIR] Mother, it's
something called "pisa"!

00:02:36.198 --> 00:02:38.450
Miss Yuna made it
for us and it's great!

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:40.869
[SHIA] No, you're
wrong, Noa. It's "visa."

00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:43.413
[YUNA] A leaning tower
and a credit card.

00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:44.665
[ELLALAURA]
Ah, so this is the food

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:47.876
you spoke of yesterday, Yuna.
Do you mind if I have some?

00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:48.794
Go ahead, ma'am!

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.671
[ELLALAURA]
Thank you so much.

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:55.300
Oh, this is absolutely
divine! I mean it!

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:57.928
And that pudding, too! You
should consider opening a shop!

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.680
No, I'm not that good.
Thank you, though.

00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:02.015
Miss Yuna, may I have
a bit of your time?

00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:04.017
I was hoping to spend
the day with Fina tomorrow.

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:05.560
Would that be all
right with you?

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.604
Huh? You wanna
spend the day with me?

00:03:07.646 --> 00:03:09.398
Yes! There's no way I could ever

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.982
complete this
errand without you!

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:13.026
I would like for it to
be just the three of us:

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:14.528
you, me, and Misa.

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.530
That's okay with me
if it's all right with you.

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:18.990
I mean, I have no complaints
as long as you're fine with it.

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:20.117
But what is this errand?

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:21.785
Our little secret!

00:03:21.827 --> 00:03:24.371
I can't wait to venture out
when it's just the three of us.

00:03:24.413 --> 00:03:25.789
[YUNA]
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

00:03:25.831 --> 00:03:27.791
Well, since Shia has
to go to the academy,

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:29.793
then I guess I'll
be on my own tomorrow.

00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:31.044
[ELLALAURA]
I have an idea!

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:33.839
Why don't you come and
observe the castle, Yuna?

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.632
The castle?

00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:43.306
Ahh! A giant, towering castle!

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:45.892
It really gives off
a whole fantasy‐like vibe!

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:47.644
Fantasy?

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:48.812
Are you sure it's no problem for

00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:50.355
an outsider like me
to go in though?

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:52.524
Of course, as long
as you're with me.

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:54.484
Excuse me, Lady Ellalaura.

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:57.904
Who might this,
well, uh, this bear be?

00:03:57.946 --> 00:03:59.573
[ELLALAURA]
This young lady is my guest.

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:01.450
I'd like to show her
around the castle.

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:02.909
Is that a problem, gentlemen?

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:05.328
[BOTH gasp]
No. Not at all, my lady!

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.788
We welcome your invited guest!

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:07.998
[YUNA]
You sure it's okay?

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.124
[ELLALAURA]
Of course.

00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:11.293
[YUNA]
Uh‐huh...

00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:16.423
Huh? A bear?

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:20.635
What is Lady Ellalaura
doing with a bear?

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:22.512
[YUNA] Man, my clothes
are kinda inappropriate

00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:24.514
for a visit to a castle.

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:25.390
Though to be honest,

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:28.685
they're sort of
inappropriate everywhere.

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:29.853
Good work, soldier.

00:04:29.895 --> 00:04:32.856
Yes. Thank you, my lady.

00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:35.942
So, Miss Ellalaura, what exactly
do you do here in the castle?

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:38.862
[ELLALAURA] You mean my job?
Oh, I handle the odds and ends.

00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:39.821
Odds and ends?

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:41.865
I give orders to the
commander of the knights,

00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:42.949
take care of documents,

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:45.076
and I sometimes give
His Majesty advice.

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:47.078
You know, various things.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.956
I'd really like to quit and go
live with Cliff, but I'm afraid

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:53.376
His Majesty and the prime
ministers just won't allow it.

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:57.214
[YUNA] Wow, it certainly sounds
like she holds a high position.

00:04:57.255 --> 00:05:00.759
It's a bear!

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:03.970
Oh, hi. And who are you?

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:06.932
Hello, Lady Flora.
What are you doing here?

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.934
Everyone was talking
about our bear visitor,

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.019
so I just had to come find her!

00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:13.563
May I ask what brings you to the
castle, Miss Bear?

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:15.315
[YUNA]
Lady Flora?

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:16.733
[ELLALAURA]
Miss Bear is my special guest

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:18.527
so I'm giving her
an unofficial tour.

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:19.402
Oh, really?

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:22.614
In that case, I wanna show
her around the castle, too!

00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:24.616
Well, Yuna? You wouldn't
turn down an offer

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:26.117
from the princess, would you?

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.411
Uhh! This little
girl's a princess?

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:29.913
No, no, no! A royal
shouldn't have to

00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:31.581
give tours to
a commonbear like me!

00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:35.710
But, Miss Bear, don't you wanna
look around the castle with me?

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:38.088
[YUNA]
Uh! I can't run.

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.548
[YUNA] Sure, I would
absolutely love to,

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.383
so please don't
cry anymore, okay?

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:44.719
[FLORA sniffs]
Okay!

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.624
[FLORA] Miss Bear drew
a picture book! It's so cute!

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:16.543
[ELLALAURA] I didn't realize
that you were an artist, Yuna.

00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:19.254
I wouldn't call myself an
artist, but I've dabbled in art.

00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:21.089
[YUNA]
I used to draw manga as a hobby.

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:22.841
[FLORA]
Thank you so much, Miss Bear.

00:06:22.883 --> 00:06:24.092
I'll treasure it forever!

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:26.553
Please, that would make
me very happy, Princess.

00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:27.387
I'll tell you what;

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.598
I'll have it bound in
a proper book for you.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.392
Yay!

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:33.935
[YUNA]
Come to think of it,

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:36.771
I wonder how Fina
and the girls are doing.

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:45.488
[FINA]
Wow, it's so crowded.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.241
It's usually busy
but even more so lately.

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:49.492
'Cause everyone is preparing for

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:51.536
His Majesty's
birthday celebration.

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:52.913
Please, dearest Noa,

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:55.290
I would love to know what
you have planned for us today.

00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:57.667
If I told you,
it'd ruin the surprise!

00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:00.211
If all went well,
it should turn out wonderful!

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.088
Wonderful? [grunts]

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.257
[MAN 8A]
Oops! I'm so sorry.

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:06.635
No. I should
apologize to you, sir.

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:08.094
Goodness, are you all right?

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:10.639
Oh, yeah, I'm fine, I just
bumped into him a little bit.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.516
I'm sorry about that! [chuckles]

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:15.268
[NOIR]
Mm...

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.355
Um, Lady Noir?

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:21.232
This way we won't get
separated. Misa, too.

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.108
Uh‐huh!

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.278
And please just call me Noa
instead of Noir from now on.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.988
That's what all my friends and
family call me.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.198
[FINA grunts]
I'd love to,

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:29.991
but I'm just a commoner
so I wouldn't dare!

00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:32.535
Don't be silly. The three
of us are bear rivals.

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:34.913
No. We're more
like bear friends!

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:36.206
Wouldn't you agree?

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:38.333
"Bear friends"? I guess so.

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:41.920
Oh! Well then, in that case,
you can just call me Misa.

00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:45.090
Okay. Thanks, Lady
Noir and Lady Misana.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:46.257
[MISANA, NOIR]
What'd we tell you?

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:47.217
It's Noa!

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:49.260
And Misa!

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:51.221
So then, Lady Noa and Lady Misa?

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:52.806
Yes! Now please promise that

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:54.683
you'll call me that
from this day forward.

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:57.435
And the same thing goes
for me as well, Fina!

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:58.979
'Kay!

00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:03.942
Welcome back, Lady Noir.
It's good to see you.

00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:06.236
Have you finished
my order yet, ma'am?

00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:10.949
I have. It's right here.
Please take a look.

00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:12.742
Oh, these are
perfect! Thank you!

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:14.327
They're just as I requested.

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:16.246
Does that say,
"Miss Bear Fan Club"?

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:19.249
[NOIR] Correct!
These are membership cards!

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.836
Uh, I wasn't aware that we were
going to organize a fan club.

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:26.339
Here. As club president,
I'm member number one.

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:28.550
You're my vice president,
so you'll be number two.

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:30.468
And Misa here is number three.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.805
Wait, I'm the vice president?
But shouldn't it be Lady Misa?

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.473
That wouldn't make
much sense because Misa

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:37.225
has only recently
met Miss Yuna and

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:39.019
you've known her
for quite a while now.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.563
Yes. Not only have you
known her the longest,

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:44.065
you're also closest and
dearest to Yuna as well.

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:45.817
It's important to make
sure that all members

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:48.486
of the fan club share
any pertinent information.

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:49.571
Share information?

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:53.033
[NOIR] That's right! We are
united as bear friends!

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:54.451
We must share
what we see and hear,

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:55.827
not just about Miss Yuna,

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:58.121
but about Kumayuru
and Kumakyu as well!

00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:00.749
It won't be long
until we're bear experts!

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.959
Wow, this is so exciting!

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.002
[NOIR]
Mm‐hm!

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:06.713
Uh, yeah, sure.

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:08.256
I think I understand.

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:09.466
[NOIR]
Now listen closely!

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:11.760
We mustn't tell Miss Yuna
about the fan club.

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:13.011
It's our secret, okay?

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:13.970
[MISANA]
Yes, of course!

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:16.264
[FINA] Lady Noa, why does
this membership card

00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:17.766
have four zeros
before the number?

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:20.477
[NOIR]
Our goal is 10,000 members!

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:23.855
[gasps]

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:30.570
[grunting]

00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:32.197
[YUNA groans]

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.448
[YUNA]
The princess was cute,

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.493
but being around royalty
made me feel really nervous.

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:37.535
[gasps]

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:39.412
Oh, hi, welcome home, Miss Yuna.

00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:41.372
Uh... thank you.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:42.332
Sword training?

00:09:42.373 --> 00:09:44.667
That's right! I'm determined
to get even stronger,

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:46.711
so that I can compete with you.

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:49.005
[YUNA] And I have no
doubt that she will!

00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:52.008
She's an honest
and hard‐working girl.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.384
If you ever need
a sparring partner,

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:54.719
I'd be happy to volunteer.

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:57.847
[SHIA] I appreciate the
offer. I'll let you know.

00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:59.808
Hah!

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:00.725
[NOIR]
Now then, let's get started.

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:01.601
Hey, guys, I'm back.

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:02.977
[NOIR]
I hereby commence our first

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:04.395
informational bear meeting.

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.439
So Miss Yuna is an
honorary chairman

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:07.774
and member number zero, correct?

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:08.691
Indeed!

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:11.820
Fina, do you have any good ideas
that are fitting as an article?

00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:13.488
Um, let me see.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.489
[YUNA]
What are you doing?

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:15.406
[GROUP gasps]

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.534
[FINA gasps] It's Yuna!

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:19.410
Oh, nothing much!
We were just chatting.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:20.537
Nothing suspicious at all!

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:21.538
[GROUP chuckles]

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:23.498
[YUNA]
Hm?

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:36.511
[GHOULZAM chuckling]

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:50.066
[FINA] Yuna, may I ask what
you're shopping for today?

00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:53.027
I'm looking for things that
would make good pizza toppings.

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:55.029
I heard that another
person was injured.

00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:56.906
Yeah, in the northern forest.

00:10:56.948 --> 00:10:58.241
You don't think those monsters

00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:00.451
would venture into
the royal capital, do you?

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.120
I can't help but
wonder what those men

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:03.663
are talking about over there.

00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:05.582
Who knows? From the
looks on their faces,

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:06.833
it doesn't seem like good news.

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:08.376
[MERCHANT 8A]
You're right, it's not.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:11.796
You see, a merchant was
attacked in the northern forest.

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:16.593
It's scary. These incidents
have been on the rise lately.

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:17.844
[YUNA]
Now that I think about it,

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:22.223
we were attacked by monsters
on the way to the capital, too.

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:23.600
The northern forest.

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:26.227
Is something the
matter, Lady Noa?

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:27.520
Well, Father told me he would be

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:29.981
arriving in the
royal capital today.

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:33.359
He'll have to pass through
the northern forest to get here.

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:35.445
Now I'm getting
worried about him.

00:11:35.486 --> 00:11:36.821
He's on his way?

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:39.324
I can go and pick him up
if you'd like me to.

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:40.325
[NOIR]
Are you sure?

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:41.868
I don't mind, really.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.369
I know that you're
perfectly capable

00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:46.164
of taking care of yourself,
but please be careful.

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:48.791
There's no need to
worry. I'll be fine!

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.297
[ELLALAURA]
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:57.050
Oh, Ellalaura. To what
do I owe the pleasure?

00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:59.969
[ELLALAURA] Unfortunately,
another person has been attacked

00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:02.430
by monsters in
the northern forest.

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:03.473
The number of incidents seems

00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:05.767
to be climbing steadily,
Your Majesty.

00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:08.811
I think we should inspect
the forest as soon as possible.

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:09.812
[KING]
Yes, I agree.

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:11.856
‐‐[clattering]
‐‐[SOLDIER 8B] You bastard!

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:13.316
[SOLDIER 8B]
Don't move!

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:16.569
[SOLDIER 8D]
Who are you? Stop!

00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:18.029
[SOLDIERS groan]

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.031
[GHOULZAM] I have no
business with you fools.

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:21.783
[ELLALAURA grunts]

00:12:25.536 --> 00:12:28.456
Greetings, Your Majesty.
It's been a while, hasn't it?

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:30.166
And just who might you be?

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:33.461
Have you forgotten me already?
My name's Ghoulzam, sire.

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:36.965
And once upon a time,
I was exiled from this kingdom.

00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:40.468
No, Ghoulzam? What do you
think you're doing here?

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.053
[GHOULZAM]
You mean you don't know?

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:44.514
I would've thought news
of the vicious monster attacks

00:12:44.555 --> 00:12:48.142
just outside the royal capital
would've reached you by now.

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:49.477
[KING]
It has. What of it?

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:52.063
I gathered those monsters
in order to create an army

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.482
so that I could
exact revenge on you.

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:55.400
All told, there are

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:58.111
approximately 10,000
of them under my control.

00:12:58.152 --> 00:13:00.405
They're magically
bound to do my bidding.

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:01.614
[ELLALAURA, KING gasp]

00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:04.284
Which means that with little
more than a snap of my fingers,

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:07.120
I can have them attack the
royal capital any time I choose.

00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:09.289
How dare you, bastard?

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.792
[GHOULZAM cackles] Yes,
that's the face I wanted to see!

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:15.628
Anger! Weariness! And despair!

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.797
But it still
isn't enough for me!

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:19.882
There are so many
more tragic expressions

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:22.635
that will be splashed
across your face in due time.

00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:24.721
[GHOULZAM chuckles]

00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:26.889
[ELLALAURA]
Was that an illusion?

00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:30.518
If so, it was created
with a high level of magic.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.562
[KING groans]

00:13:32.603 --> 00:13:35.481
[ELLALAURA] Your Majesty,
may I ask you who that was?

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:37.567
Ghoulzam, he was
a royal magician

00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:40.570
who sacrificed criminals
for his research.

00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:44.240
When we found out, he was
severely punished and exiled.

00:13:44.282 --> 00:13:45.616
Please, Ellalaura,

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:48.286
contact the master of the
adventurer's guild at once.

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:50.913
I'm afraid we're gonna need
Sanya's help with this one.

00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:53.458
Consider it done.

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:59.380
[YUNA humming]

00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:01.716
Let's take a looksee.

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:04.093
Ugh, they're crawling
around all over the place.

00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:05.803
Who knew there'd be this many?

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:07.305
[KUMAYURU whines]

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:08.806
[YUNA]
While it'd be easy enough for me

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:10.558
to get through the forest alone,

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.143
it'd be too dangerous
to travel through it

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:14.020
on the way back
because of Cliff.

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:17.732
Maybe I should consider
taking a detour instead.

00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:20.109
Nah! Let's take 'em down!

00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:24.030
I've now reached the
skies above the forest.

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:26.199
Thank you so much, Miss Sanya.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.158
[SANYA]
My pleasure.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.452
I'll try to estimate the
size of the monster army

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:31.371
and look out for
Ghoulzam. [gasps]

00:14:31.412 --> 00:14:32.497
What's wrong?

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:33.831
[SANYA] There appears
to be something running

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:36.501
into the forest at
an incredible speed.

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:37.335
That so?

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:38.669
But what could it be?

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:41.005
A monster? No, that's not it.

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:42.048
It's a bear!

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.674
A bear on top of a bear!

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:45.385
Huh?

00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:47.762
[roars]

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:50.098
[yells]

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:51.682
[KUMAKYU, KUMAYURU grunting]

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:55.061
The bear is easily defeating
the monsters one after another!

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:57.397
I don't get it. What
do you mean "a bear"?

00:14:57.438 --> 00:14:58.815
How could that be possible?

00:14:58.856 --> 00:15:00.608
[ELLALAURA]
A bear?

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:01.484
No way!

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:02.985
[gasps] This is bad.

00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:04.821
[KING]
Oh, no, what now?

00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:07.407
[SANYA] The bear is
totally surrounded by orcs.

00:15:07.448 --> 00:15:09.575
And there are
wyverns flying above!

00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:12.036
[KING]
Wyverns? They're powerful!

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:14.831
To think Ghoulzam
has control of them!

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:17.875
[YUNA grunts]

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:20.962
[ORC 8A groans]

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:26.342
The bear... It appears that
it has defeated all of the orcs

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:28.469
and wyverns that attacked it.

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:31.806
[KING] You're kidding! All on
its own? What's with this bear?

00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:33.391
[ELLALAURA]
"Do not make her your enemy"

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:35.268
and "Don't anger her."

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:38.521
So this is what you
meant, Cliff. Now I see.

00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:40.273
[KING]
Just to be sure I understand,

00:15:40.314 --> 00:15:42.400
you're saying this bear
has seemingly wiped out

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:44.277
all the monsters
who attacked it?

00:15:44.318 --> 00:15:45.528
I'm not sure of its reasoning,

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.114
but that certainly seems
to be the case. [gasps]

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:49.198
[KING]
What is it?

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.409
[SANYA] A man has appeared
among the monsters.

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.286
The royal crest is on his robe!

00:15:53.327 --> 00:15:55.496
Huh? No, it's Ghoulzam!

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:57.707
[GHOULZAM]
Why, you little‐‐! Who are you?!

00:15:57.748 --> 00:15:59.709
Just a bear passing
through the forest.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.419
But now that you ask,
who are you?

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:02.879
That's not your business!

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.298
Do you really expect me
to believe you're a bear?

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:06.632
You're spouting nonsense!

00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:08.593
The king sent you
here, didn't he?!

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:09.469
Huh?

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.013
[GHOULZAM] I've spent years
building my army of monsters

00:16:12.054 --> 00:16:14.223
and you defeated
them in mere minutes!

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:17.185
I've been bested by
a girl in a bear costume!

00:16:17.226 --> 00:16:18.394
Look, I don't know
what's going on,

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:21.272
but there's no need to
insult my outfit like that.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:24.692
[GHOULZAM coughing]

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:26.986
[YUNA grunts]
Ew! That's not good!

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:27.987
From what I can tell,

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:30.531
the monsters are being
controlled by forbidden magic

00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:32.533
which drains the
user's life force.

00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:35.828
It seems as though this man
won't be around much longer.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.371
I never would've
thought Ghoulzam

00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:40.583
would sacrifice his own
life just to get revenge.

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:44.629
[panting]

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.548
[SANYA gasps] I've never
seen such a giant worm!

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.383
And it's under his control, too!

00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:50.718
[KING grunts]

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.803
[SANYA] Now Ghoulzam and the
worm are attacking the bear!

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:53.846
[gasps]

00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:55.139
[GHOULZAM]
Die!

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:57.975
[YUNA] Oh, great, another
one of those kinda enemies.

00:16:58.017 --> 00:17:01.646
Behold my Bears of Fire! Go!

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:05.233
[FIRE BEARS]
Kuma! Kuma! Kuma!

00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:12.198
[GIANT WORM 8A roars]

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.450
‐‐[GHOULZAM] Huh?
‐‐[YUNA] Let's go, Bear Punch!

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:17.870
[GHOULZAM groans]

00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:20.289
Whew. I guess that's
the end of that.

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:22.208
Wait, uh...

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.294
Who the heck is this guy anyway?

00:17:25.336 --> 00:17:28.214
[SANYA] It appears that Ghoulzam
and the worm have been defeated.

00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:30.341
Huh? Are you kidding me?

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:31.842
The bear defeated
them that fast?

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:33.261
Your Majesty.

00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:37.348
I think I have an idea
of who that bear might be.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:42.103
[CLIFF gasps] Oh, my goodness,
what in the world happened here?

00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:43.187
[YUNA]
Oh! Hiya, Cliff!

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:44.814
Huh?

00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:46.190
Man, talk about perfect timing.

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:47.692
You know, I was just
coming to pick you up!

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:48.568
Yuna?

00:17:48.609 --> 00:17:50.820
[EAGLE screeches]

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:53.698
So that's what happened today.

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:56.242
Okay, then. Yes, I suppose
that makes sense.

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:58.661
And thank you for
heading out to meet me.

00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:00.788
It's likely my party
and I would've fallen victim

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.873
to these monsters
if it weren't for you.

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:05.626
But what do you think we
should do about this mess?

00:18:05.668 --> 00:18:08.087
I have no idea
who this gentleman is.

00:18:08.129 --> 00:18:09.714
But you defeated
so many monsters

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:11.173
it's bound to cause quite a stir

00:18:11.215 --> 00:18:12.633
when word gets
back to the capital.

00:18:12.675 --> 00:18:14.594
[YUNA] Uhh... I didn't
think about that.

00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:17.054
I really don't wanna stand out.
So do me a solid?

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:17.888
Do a what?

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.141
You should turn the guy
in and not mention me!

00:18:20.182 --> 00:18:21.767
Uh, just tell everyone
that you found him

00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:22.852
lying on the side of the road

00:18:22.893 --> 00:18:24.854
and you have no idea
how he got there.

00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:28.065
And then I'll hide all
the monsters in my item bag!

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:29.859
As much as I would
love to help you out,

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.360
I can't give a false report.

00:18:31.402 --> 00:18:33.070
But you still owe me, remember?

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:35.740
For the sword of
the goblin king.

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:38.868
Yes. I remember.

00:18:40.703 --> 00:18:43.247
[YUNA sighs] I'm so happy
that nothing strange happened

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:45.541
during our journey through
the forest, aren't you?

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:48.336
Oh, yes, nothing strange at all.

00:18:48.377 --> 00:18:49.879
[ELLALAURA]
I'm so glad you're back!

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.756
I had a feeling that
you'd come to welcome me,

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:54.508
my dear Ellalaura! Uh‐‐

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.302
[ELLALAURA] Yuna,
I need you to come with me!

00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:58.137
Huh? Me? But why?

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:00.431
His Majesty would
like to see you.

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:02.475
[CLIFF, YUNA]
The king?

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:06.395
[ELLALAURA]
It really is Ghoulzam.

00:19:06.437 --> 00:19:09.357
You did it. You saved
the royal capital, Yuna.

00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:10.441
Huh? What?

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:12.902
Wait a minute, how did you know?

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:16.947
[YUNA] I don't wanna do this!
Can't it be our secret?

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:19.950
Just tell the king that a random
adventurer defeated Ghoulzam!

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:22.203
I wouldn't recommend lying
to His Majesty, the king.

00:19:22.244 --> 00:19:23.871
On the other hand,
if you want to lie to Cliff,

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:25.998
I think that's
perfectly acceptable.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.333
H‐Hey!

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:31.295
[SOLDIER 8F] Presenting Cliff
Foschurose, Lady Ellalaura,

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:33.214
and the adventurer, Miss Yuna.

00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:35.966
You may now enter!

00:19:43.766 --> 00:19:45.101
Sire, I've brought the bear,

00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:48.562
otherwise known as
the adventurer, Yuna.

00:19:48.604 --> 00:19:52.233
Oh, my. I don't see a bear.
I see a bear girl.

00:19:52.274 --> 00:19:55.569
Did this child defeat Ghoulzam
and his army of monsters?

00:19:55.611 --> 00:19:57.238
I dunno. To be
completely honest,

00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:59.573
I think that it might've
been a different adventurer.

00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:00.783
Wait, Your Majesty,

00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:03.077
I can say with all
certainty that this girl

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:04.995
is the one who fought
Ghoulzam in the forest.

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:05.996
[KING]
Hm.

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:07.498
While today's feat
was impressive,

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.291
what's equally
impressive is that Yuna

00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:12.920
also defeated the goblin king
and the black viper in Crimonia.

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:15.172
Isn't that right, Cliff?

00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:16.006
Well, uh...

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:17.341
[YUNA]
Don't tell him.

00:20:17.383 --> 00:20:18.968
[CLIFF]
Ellalaura's correct, sire.

00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:20.928
I can confirm that
Yuna defeated Ghoulzam

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.221
and his army of monsters.

00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:23.806
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:25.057
[YUNA]
What are you doing?!

00:20:25.099 --> 00:20:28.269
I apologize, but I simply
cannot lie to His Majesty.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.605
[YUNA groans]
You traitor...

00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:32.815
I see.

00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:34.817
You saved us today.

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:37.653
On behalf of the citizens,
all the soldiers,

00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:40.239
and the adventurers who
live in the royal capital,

00:20:40.281 --> 00:20:41.866
we give you thanks.

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:44.785
Uh! But why would
a king bow his head to me?

00:20:44.827 --> 00:20:47.288
My most important duty is to act

00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:51.333
as the representative of all
my people, and so, I thank you.

00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:53.586
[YUNA] First there was
Cliff, and now this king.

00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:56.380
The nobles of this world sure
are different than I imagined.

00:20:56.422 --> 00:20:58.924
They're not stuffy at all;
they're so nice!

00:20:58.966 --> 00:20:59.884
I shall make an announcement

00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:01.844
about your feat of
bravery to the citizens,

00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:04.430
and then we can discuss
a fitting reward for you.

00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:05.639
An announcement?

00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:08.392
No, please don't do that, and
I don't need a reward either!

00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:10.060
Huh? Why's that?

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:12.146
I don't want anyone
fussing over me.

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:15.191
And, to be honest, I only
defeated those monsters because

00:21:15.232 --> 00:21:17.026
they were interfering
with something else.

00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:17.860
Really?

00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:19.153
Yeah, my friend was worried

00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:22.281
about her father's safety while
travelling through the forest.

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:25.367
So I had to defeat the monsters
on my way to pick him up.

00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:27.578
[gasps] On the way?

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.746
Now wait one minute.

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:31.540
Let me make sure I've got
this straight, young lady.

00:21:31.582 --> 00:21:34.043
You defeated an army
of monsters merely because

00:21:34.084 --> 00:21:37.671
your friend was worried
about her father's safety?

00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:39.507
In my humble opinion,
Your Majesty,

00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:41.258
"merely" implies
that it wasn't important

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.594
and it most certainly was to me.

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:45.471
[ELLALAURA, CLIFF chuckle]

00:21:46.889 --> 00:21:49.016
[KING]
Hmm.

00:21:52.394 --> 00:21:55.105
[NOIR]
Father! Welcome home!

00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:57.066
Yes! I made it, Noa.

00:21:57.107 --> 00:21:58.943
You're back, too, Yuna!

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:00.945
Yep, everything
worked out just fine.

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:03.531
Good! I'm glad to hear it!

00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:09.870
[YUNA]
The smiles of these children...

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:17.336
[YUNA] They're definitely a good
reason to keep up the fight.

00:23:52.932 --> 00:23:54.725
[KUMAYURU]
Kuma!
