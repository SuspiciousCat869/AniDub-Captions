00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.310
Will you marry me?
Please, Tiermina?

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:21.730
As your husband, I promise
I will protect all of you.

00:00:21.772 --> 00:00:24.149
I'll take care of you,
Fina and Shuri.

Um...

Are you saying no?

00:00:36.078 --> 00:00:39.498
Ah. [giggles] Oh, Gentz.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.541
I'd love to.

Congratulations,
I'm so happy for you!

Oh, my!

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.340
Hold on, were you girls
spying on us just now?

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:49.633
[YUNA]
Congrats, Gentz.

00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:52.177
You had better take extra
good care of Fina and Shuri.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:53.512
I will, watch and see!

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:54.888
I'll be sure to make
the three of them

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.099
the happiest they've
ever been in their lives!

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.893
I have no doubt that you will.

00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:03.855
[GENTZ chuckles]
I'm so relieved!

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.233
[YUNA]
Man.

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:08.277
Yesterday was pretty perfect.

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:09.236
I'm sure Gentz will be

00:01:09.278 --> 00:01:11.738
an excellent addition
to their family.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.365
I've got bad news, Yuna!

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:16.076
Mom's gonna call
off the wedding!

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:19.788
[YUNA]
Huh?

00:02:52.923 --> 00:02:55.926
Hold on, your mom's
breaking off the engagement?

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:57.052
[FINA]
I think so.

00:02:57.094 --> 00:03:00.889
It happened when Uncle Gentz
came to eat breakfast with us.

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:08.480
[TIERMINA]
Wow, Gentz.

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:10.023
Would you like some
egg with your ketchup?

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:11.274
That's so much.

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:14.027
I mean, eggs have a really
bland taste by themselves.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.197
The ketchup just helps it
pack a little more punch.

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.325
Yes, but it's not healthy for
you. Not to mention you used

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:22.619
way too much butter
on your bread, earlier.

00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:25.455
Wait, why does it matter to you
how much butter I'm using?

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:28.083
Plus, you're the one who
slathers your bread with honey.

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:30.335
That's because honey
is good for your body.

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:31.753
Something you
should consider more

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:33.130
since you don't
take care of yours.

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:34.423
I take care of it!

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:37.718
But I would also like for my
food to have a little taste!

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.387
[TIERMINA grunts]
But it's not healthy!

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:43.515
Look, you need to start
taking care of yourself better!

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:44.891
You over season things

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:46.810
and don't clean up
after yourself properly.

00:03:46.852 --> 00:03:50.355
What if the girls start
to pick up your bad habits?

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:53.942
[sighs] I'm starting to
think this might not work out.

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:55.485
I need some space.

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:57.195
[FINA gasps]

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.743
Oh, no, what should we do?

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:08.707
So now they're both fighting.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:11.626
Let them sort it out. They say
even dogs don't interfere

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:12.878
when a couple is fighting.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.880
And that applies to bears, too.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:15.839
Oh, really?

00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:17.382
Basically, it means
that they'll work through

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:20.302
their problems together, so
there's no need to get involved.

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:22.345
But I'm just really afraid

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.765
the two of them will
break up or something.

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:28.727
So Shuri and I decided to get
them a snow crystal flower!

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:29.978
A snow crystal flower?

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.356
Yeah. It's extremely
special and very rare.

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:34.733
My mom, dad, and Uncle Gentz

00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:37.319
found the first time that
they ever partied together.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.154
It's such an amazing story.

00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:41.907
My mom has told it to me
at least a dozen times.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.201
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Now that you mention it,

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.702
I do remember
Miss Tiermina saying

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:46.995
she used to be an adventurer.

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:48.455
If we can get the flower,

00:04:48.497 --> 00:04:50.499
then we can show it to
my Mom and Uncle Gentz

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.042
and they won't break up anymore.

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.669
That's why Shuri and
I wanna go look for it.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:55.921
Seems important to you.

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:58.381
In that case, I guess
I could tag along with you.

00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:00.050
Do you know where
to find the flower?

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:01.843
Yes. And if we leave right now,

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:04.429
we'll make it back home
before it gets too dark.

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:06.264
[YUNA] Shuri is coming, too?

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:10.560
Better summon Kumayuru
and Kumakyu just to be safe.

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:12.312
Sure. Let's go.

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:16.608
[FINA giggles] Thank you,
Yuna, I appreciate it!

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.079
Uh, Shuri?

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.748
Hey, big sis, do you
think Mom and Uncle Gentz

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.209
are gonna be okay?

00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:36.253
Yeah, once we get the
flower and show it to them,

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:39.005
everything will be fine again.

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:42.425
[giggles] Let's hurry
and find it!

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.803

eating those stupid berries!

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.583
And if we stay gone for too
long, it's gonna make Mom upset!

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:26.417
Not yet!

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:29.504
Don't worry about it;
everything's gonna be okay.

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:30.922
[gasps]

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:32.423
[SHURI]
Something's sparkling!

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:33.967
[FINA]
Huh?

00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:39.889
There it is again!

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:42.350
[FINA]
Shuri?

00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:44.060
[SHURI]
Oh, no! Don't flail so much!

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:45.103
What is it?

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:46.354
It's a little birdie.

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:48.898
[BIRD chirping]

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.692
I'll help you!

00:10:52.277 --> 00:10:54.779
Yeah, let's get it free!

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:57.782
[SHURI]
Almost done.

00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:02.120
I can't seem to get
the vine untangled! Uh!

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:04.414
I'll need you to hold
down it's wings, Shuri.

00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:07.292
Okay! I need you to
stay still, Mister Birdie!

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:11.379
You be sure to hold still, too.

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:12.839
[BOTH gasp]

00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:14.757
That should do the trick.

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:19.762
Can you still fly?

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:25.351
Hooray!

00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:27.312
Looks like there were
no major injuries.

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:29.439
That's great!

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.275
But it wasn't
the flower we needed.

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:33.651
[YUNA]
Think of the positives.

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:35.945
Like, you saved the
bird because you refused

00:11:35.987 --> 00:11:37.780
to give up on your
search for the flower.

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:39.282
Yeah.

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:43.244
[gasps]

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:48.666
[SHURI gasps, giggles]

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:52.086
[FINA]
Ahh!

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:53.046
It's so pretty!

00:11:53.087 --> 00:11:55.757
I wonder if the bird gave
it to you as a thank you.

00:11:55.798 --> 00:11:57.675
Probably! I've got an idea!

00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.802
What if we gave this
feather to Mom and Uncle Gentz

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:02.972
instead of the snow flower?
Do you think they'll like it?

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:04.974
I bet they would
love that, Shuri.

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:05.808
Yay!

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.978
[FINA, SHURI giggles]

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:20.031
[SHURI whispers]
Do you see him? Uncle Gentz?

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:23.493
[FINA] He's here,
but they're not talking.

00:12:23.534 --> 00:12:26.079
What if they're still fighting?

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.915
Why don't you go inside for now?

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:29.749
Okay.

00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:32.669
Well, if you insist.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:33.920
[FINA, SHURI]
Hey, we're back home.

00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:35.129
Sorry to interrupt.

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:36.631
Oh, hey there, Yuna.

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:38.216
Where've you been all day?

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:39.092
They're fine?

00:12:39.133 --> 00:12:40.635
But the fight...

00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:42.303
[TIERMINA]
Fight? [chuckles]

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:44.681
Don't be ridiculous;
we weren't fighting.

00:12:44.722 --> 00:12:46.474
Right, it was just a discussion.

00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:48.810
So, tell me, where
have you two been all day?

00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:50.979
Were you helping
Miss Yuna again?

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.106
No, we went to
look for a flower,

00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:55.650
because we thought you
two were having a fight.

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:57.402
A flower?

00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:59.070
[SHURI]
Yeah, the snow crystal flower.

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:00.280
[TIERMINA gasps]

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:02.699
Hold on. You left the city?

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.951
[FINA]
We couldn't find it, though.

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:07.578
[SHURI]
But we found this. Here!

00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:10.790
[gasps]

00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:14.085
It's not a flower, but
you guys can still have it.

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:15.253
No way.

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:17.922
You're saying you found
that feather today?

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:19.716
Yeah, a bird gave it to us.

00:13:19.757 --> 00:13:21.217
It was actually
caught in a bramble,

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:23.594
but Shuri found it
and set it free.

00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:28.433
I see. It's just like...

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:29.809
...the one Roy had.

00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:32.103
Fina and Shuri's father
used a similar feather

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:34.314
and always wore it as
a sort of good luck charm.

00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:35.148
Huh?

00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:37.525
Our Dad had one?

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:40.862
[TIERMINA] I remember
it well. It was so beautiful.

00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:42.864
[GENTZ] He always wore
it with his equipment.

00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:46.326
[TIERMINA]
Yes. He treasured that feather.

00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:47.869
I can't believe
that the two of you

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.038
brought back
something so similar.

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:51.372
And I'm sure...

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:54.125
...it was a special
message just for you.

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:56.294
To reassure you.

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:58.796
Roy was always such
a thoughtful guy.

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:02.216
[TIERMINA] Yes, he must
have been worried about us.

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:08.014
[TIERMINA] The three of us
went so many places together.

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:10.683
And had so many adventures.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:14.228
How nostalgic.

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:17.774
[GENTZ]
You're right. But Tiermina...

00:14:17.815 --> 00:14:18.983
Huh?

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:21.527
Roy is still by our
side watching over us.

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:23.905
And because of that,
I feel more confident.

00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:26.366
I know that I'll be able
to protect not only you,

00:14:26.407 --> 00:14:27.575
but the girls, as well.

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:30.078
Oh, my, Gentz.

00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:33.790
Shuri, Fina.
Now listen to me carefully.

00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:34.707
[FINA grunts]

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:37.877
I know that I can be
a little bit of a mess.

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:39.295
But would you please allow me

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:42.673
the great privilege of
being your new step‐father?

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:44.509
[FINA, SHURI gasp]

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.676
Yes, of course!

00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:48.012
‐‐[GENTZ gasps]
‐‐[SHURI] Oh! Me, too!

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:50.515
Daddy!

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:53.267
I'll take care of you girls.

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:55.770
You have my word.

00:14:55.853 --> 00:14:58.147
You and I are truly fortunate.

00:14:58.189 --> 00:15:01.067
I have no idea
what's in our future,

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:04.070
but I know that I don't
wanna lose anyone else.

00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:05.405
[GENTZ]
Tiermina,

00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:07.782
I'm gonna be a lot more
careful about my health!

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:11.035
I promise I'll eat better!
And I'll clean up more, too!

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:13.663
[TIERMINA]
Thank you, Gentz.

00:15:13.704 --> 00:15:15.331
We're counting on you.

00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:17.875
[GENTZ] But maybe I can
still have ketchup sometimes?

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:20.753
[TIERMINA]
Okay, on special occasions.

00:15:24.215 --> 00:15:26.217
[ALL gasp]

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:30.847
Well, it looks like you were
right after all, huh, Yuna?

00:15:30.888 --> 00:15:32.807
I'm not really
sure what you mean.

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:36.269
You know, how even bears don't
interfere with a couple's fight.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:40.022
[YUNA chucklea]
You mean dogs.

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:43.484
[door opens]

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:46.737
[SHURI grunts]
Not here.

00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:50.867
[gasps]

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:59.000
Uh! Or in here either!

00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:02.920
[SHURI gasps]

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:04.338
[SHURI]
Oh, or here.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.800
‐‐[FINA] Shuri!
‐‐[SHURI gasps] I'm coming!

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:12.638
[FINA] Didn't you say
you wanted to help us?

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.098
[SHURI]
Mm!

00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:17.059
[SHURI]
I was wondering.

00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:19.937
Where are Kumayuru
and Kumakyu hiding?

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:22.565
[YUNA] Oh. I guess
I haven't told you yet, huh?

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:25.276
They're tucked inside
of here sleeping right now.

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:26.569
Aw, so should we be quiet?

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:29.030
Nah, you don't have to
worry about whispering.

00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:33.409
Okay. Let's get started.

00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:35.453
[FINA]
What kind of food are we making?

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:36.704
[YUNA]
It's pudding.

00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:37.914
[FINA, SHURI]
Pudding?

00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:41.626
[YUNA] Yeah, it's a dessert
that you can make using eggs.

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:44.003
[SHURI] That sounds neat!
What is it like?

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:48.049
[YUNA] Hmm, let's see. Well,
it's yellow and really jiggly.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.343
Oh, and it has a sweet sauce
that you pour on the top.

00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:51.177
It's super good.

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:52.178
[SHURI]
Really?

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.347
[YUNA]
It's creamy and delicious.

00:16:54.388 --> 00:16:56.557
I'm almost positive
that you two will love it.

00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:58.684
[SHURI]
I wanna hurry and taste it!

00:16:58.726 --> 00:17:00.603
[FINA]
You can make treats with eggs?

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:04.148
[YUNA] Sure can. Eggs can be
used in all sorts of recipes.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.441
[SHURI]
Amazing!

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:07.944
[FINA] In that case,
will you teach me more recipes?

00:17:07.985 --> 00:17:08.861
[YUNA]
All right.

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:11.864
There are still lots of things
I want to try making, too.

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:12.949
[FINA]
Thank you!

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.076
I never knew eggs
could be both nutritious

00:17:15.117 --> 00:17:17.119
and taste sweet
at the same time.

00:17:17.161 --> 00:17:18.913
How incredible!

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.998
[YUNA] Do the two of you
ever cook at home?

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:21.874
[FINA]
Yes.

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:24.752
I pretty much did all the
cooking while Mom was sick.

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:27.046
But Shuri helped me
out when she could.

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:29.507
[YUNA]
Aw, you're so responsible!

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:30.883
[SHURI] But now that
she's feeing better,

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:34.554
Mommy is cooking a lot more now!
Her food is so yummy!

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:36.347
[FINA, SHURI gasp]

00:17:37.348 --> 00:17:38.808
[SHURI] I can't wait for them to
be done!

00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:40.560
[FINA]
I hope that they turn out well.

00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:42.186
I'm sure they'll taste awesome.

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:44.105
You wanna take some
to your mom and Mister Gentz

00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:45.106
when they're all finished?

00:17:45.147 --> 00:17:47.191
Can we really? Yay!

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:49.193
Guess what?
Now that he's our dad,

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:51.028
we're gonna be moving
into a new house

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.655
so we can all live together.

00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:53.990
Oh, is that so?

00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:56.617
Yep, and our new house
is gonna be even bigger!

00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:58.452
I get the feeling
you might be excited.

00:17:58.494 --> 00:17:59.996
I can't wait!

00:18:00.037 --> 00:18:02.164
What about you?
I've never seen your family.

00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:04.375
Do they live close by
or are they far away?

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:07.837
Uh! [chuckles] They're
actually in another country.

00:18:07.878 --> 00:18:09.547
Do you ever get lonely?

00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:11.090
Of course not. How could I?

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:12.925
I've got you guys to keep me
company.

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:14.510
That's true! [giggles]

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:16.554
Good point, Yuna!

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:17.805
[YUNA]
Well, then,

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:19.724
it'll take a while for
this to bake and then cool,

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:22.310
so why don't we eat
dinner and take a bath?

00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:24.186
[FINA, SHURI]
Okay!

00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:27.106
[FINA, SHURI gasp]

00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:28.524
Wow, it looks so delicious!

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:29.859
What is this feast?

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.152
It's Hamburg steak.

00:18:31.193 --> 00:18:33.529
A reward since you two
worked so hard yesterday.

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:35.489
Okay. You girls ready to eat?

00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:36.365
But first...

00:18:36.407 --> 00:18:39.201
[ALL] Thank you so much
for this delicious dinner.

00:18:39.243 --> 00:18:41.537
[SHURI]
Mm! It's amazing!

00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:46.125
Here, Sis! Say, "Aah"!

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:48.461
Thank you, Shuri. Aah!

00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:50.129
[SHURI giggles]

00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:53.549
[YUNA]
They're such an adorable pair.

00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:55.259
They're like the
perfect sisters.

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:57.136
[SHURI]
Yay! Thanks, Sis!

00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:00.389
[SHURI, FINA]
Your turn, Yuna!

00:19:00.431 --> 00:19:02.224
Aaah!

00:19:02.266 --> 00:19:03.142
Say it!

00:19:03.184 --> 00:19:06.896
[YUNA gulps]
Aah...

00:19:06.937 --> 00:19:09.148
[YUNA]
So good!

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:11.776
[YUNA]
I've always wondered

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:14.945
what it would be like
to have little sisters.

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:16.614
[FINA]
Shuri, sit down.

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:18.115
[SHURI]
Okay!

00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:20.284
‐‐[buzzing]
‐‐[SHURI gasps] What's this?

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:21.661
[FINA]
It's called a "hair dryer."

00:19:21.702 --> 00:19:24.455
It dries your hair.
Is it too hot?

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:26.999
[SHURI]
Nope! It feels nice.

00:19:27.041 --> 00:19:28.334
I'm sleepy.

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:29.877
[FINA giggles]
Don't fall asleep.

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.212
We still have dessert.

00:19:31.253 --> 00:19:32.630
[SHURI gasps]
Poopin'!

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:34.548
‐‐[YUNA giggles]
‐‐[FINA] It's pudding.

00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:37.093
All right!

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:43.766
[YUNA chuckles] Keep it
a secret from your mom, 'kay?

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:47.019
It's not always good to eat
sweets so late at night.

00:19:47.061 --> 00:19:47.937
Voila!

00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:49.397
‐‐[FINA] Oh, wow!
‐‐[SHURI] Poopin'!

00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:51.482
[YUNA]
It's pudding. Dig in!

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:59.448
[BOTH squeal]
So yummy!

00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:03.661
It practically
melts in your mouth.

00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:05.287
Hey, slow down Shuri.

00:20:05.329 --> 00:20:07.581
I can't; it's way too yummy!

00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:09.125
Oh, yeah. Did you
have a good time

00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:11.293
on our adventure
yesterday, Shuri?

00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:13.838
It's the first time
you've gone that far, right?

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:16.173
Uh‐huh! I had an amazing time!

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:19.343
My heart was so excited!
I loved seeing the little birdy!

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:20.469
Yeah, I know what you mean.

00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:22.847
It's probably the best trip
I've ever taken before!

00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:24.932
It was so fun.

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:26.726
I wanna go again soon!

00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:29.061
It'd be fun to explore
different places.

00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:30.521
[SHURI]
What places?

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:31.689
Like a castle!

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:33.441
[SHURI]
You mean where princesses live?

00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:34.859
[FINA]
Mm! Yeah, like that.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.986
I also wanna see
the ocean one day.

00:20:37.027 --> 00:20:38.446
It's way bigger than a lake

00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:41.323
and all the water
in it is really salty.

00:20:41.365 --> 00:20:44.326
So it's all salty?
It doesn't sound very tasty.

00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:45.536
It's really not.

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:46.996
But I think it's
interesting that

00:20:47.037 --> 00:20:49.790
there's such a huge
body of water out there.

00:20:49.832 --> 00:20:51.959
[SHURI]
It sounds kind of scary.

00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:53.669
When Mom and Dad
were adventurers,

00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:56.130
they traveled to all
sorts of different places.

00:20:56.172 --> 00:20:59.049
Maybe we can do the same thing
once we grow up a bit more.

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:01.135
That sounds super exciting!

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:03.971
[FINA] There are all kinds of
weird fish in the ocean, too!

00:21:04.013 --> 00:21:07.808
Are there really?
I wanna see the fishies!

00:21:18.861 --> 00:21:20.029
[YUNA]
A lot of interesting things

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.740
have happened since
I came to this world.

00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:24.450
But it also looks like
there's a lot of stuff

00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:26.786
that I don't know about it yet.

00:21:37.046 --> 00:21:38.589
What's this? Looks good!

00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:40.174
What is this concoction?

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:41.884
It's called pudding?

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:44.136
Is it something you eat?

00:21:45.513 --> 00:21:46.931
[NOA squeals]

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:49.266
Well, what do you
think? [laughs]

00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:50.643
It's fantastic.

00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:53.020
[YUNA]
Glad you like it.

00:21:53.062 --> 00:21:54.355
[CLIFF]
Did you make this yourself?

00:21:54.396 --> 00:21:56.440
Uh‐huh. I made way
too big of a batch,

00:21:56.482 --> 00:21:58.692
so I thought I'd share
the extras with everybody.

00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:00.444
I had no idea that
you could make something

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:02.238
so delicious with eggs!

00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:05.950
Yes, it's comparable to the
sweets from the royal capital.

00:22:05.991 --> 00:22:08.536
Huh? The royal capital, huh?
Sounds interesting.

00:22:08.577 --> 00:22:09.912
I wonder what it's like there.

00:22:09.954 --> 00:22:12.665
[CLIFF] Well, I'm actually
glad that you asked, Yuna.

00:22:12.706 --> 00:22:13.833
Because I wanted to know

00:22:13.874 --> 00:22:16.001
if you'd take Noa
to the capital for me.

00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:18.754
[grunts, gasps]

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.350
[KUMAYURU]
Kuma.
