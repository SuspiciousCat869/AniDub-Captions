WEBVTT

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.771
[VILLAGER 4A]
So this is a black viper.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:21.647
[VILLAGER 4B]
It's huge!

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:22.773
[VILLAGER 4C]
How'd the Bloody Bear

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:25.275
manage to defeat such a beast?

00:00:25.317 --> 00:00:26.693
All right, everyone!

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:29.655
We're going to start on
harvesting the black viper now!

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:30.739
It's high‐quality.

00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:32.741
If we take too long, it'll rot.

00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:35.452
We're going to split its
body into ten parts first!

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:38.413
After that, we'll skin it
and remove its teeth.

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:40.749
Report to me if you
find the mana gem!

00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:41.875
[CROWD]
Yes, sir!

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:42.793
[VILLAGER 4D]
I've got the eyes.

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:45.587
[VILLAGER 4E]
Look! The inside's been roasted!

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:47.923
[inaudible]

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:50.342
[FINA] My days have been
full of nothing but surprises

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:52.719
ever since I met
Yuna in the forest.

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:55.639
She slays monster after monster.

00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:59.309
And she built an amazing
house in the blink of an eye!

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.814
[GENTZ] The black viper
has skin like armor,

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:05.274
so blades can't pierce it.

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:06.441
You have to cut a little notch,

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:08.944
and then peel the skin
away from that point.

00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:10.320
Right.

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:11.655
[FINA]
I heard that Yuna was the one

00:01:11.697 --> 00:01:15.867
who defeated this monster,
and she did it all on her own!

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:21.832
[FINA]
I can believe it.

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:24.710
Because Yuna's
great at everything!

00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.596
[YUNA]
Here goes.

00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:03.392
A table, a couch.

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:04.726
Some dishes.

00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:06.311
[BOY 4A]
It really is a bear!

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:08.689
‐‐[YUNA] Hm?
‐‐[GIRL 4A] It's so cute!

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.774
[BOY 4A]
A bear living in a bear house.

00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:12.859
I heard that she's
called the Bloody Bear.

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:14.653
Look! She's at the window!

00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:17.239
My house isn't a show
for you, so get out of here!

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.990
I mean it, scram!

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:21.118
[BOY 4A]
Whoa, she sounds mad!

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.287
[BOY 4C]
Let's go before she eats us.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.997
[sighs]

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.708
[YUNA] I suppose
a bear house popping up

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.710
out of nowhere
is pretty unusual.

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:31.920
It was bound to attract
some spectators.

00:03:31.962 --> 00:03:32.879
[FINA]
Hey there, Yuna!

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:33.964
Huh?

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:36.216
We finished harvesting
the black viper for you!

00:03:36.258 --> 00:03:37.509
[YUNA]
Awesome!

00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:39.219
Come on in!

00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:40.429
[FINA]
Thanks for having me.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.848
[gasps] You got furniture!

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.683
Uh‐huh, it's taking
me some effort,

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:47.310
but I'm making it livable,
slowly but surely.

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:48.645
[YUNA]
It'd be a bit more livable

00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:51.940
without the constant
onlookers, though.

00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:54.025
[FINA grunts]

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:54.860
[YUNA]
Hm?

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:58.071
Okay. Here's the
black viper's mana gem.

00:03:58.113 --> 00:04:00.449
[YUNA]
Whoa, it's huge.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.534
Thanks, Fina.

00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:07.664
Hey, what happened to your hand?

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:09.499
Oh! You mean this?

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:12.335
Uhh, I cut myself while
harvesting the snake.

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:14.087
Thankfully, it's
not all that serious.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.088
Yeah, perhaps.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.924
But you could make it worse
or it could get infected.

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:23.138
Not bad, but maybe
I can try to heal it.

00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:27.017
[YUNA]
I can use spells by imagining

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:28.977
the type of magic
I want to cast.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:31.772
So, if I think about
the wound closing up...

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:35.358
Healing!

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.697
[gasps] No way!

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:42.491
Aw, sweet! It really worked!

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:46.995
Amazing, I didn't know you
could do healing magic.

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:48.079
[YUNA]
It appears so!

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:50.499
But just to be safe, you
probably should take a break

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.958
from harvesting tomorrow.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.752
Uh! You sure?

00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:54.586
I think it's healed,

00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:58.340
but you don't wanna risk
opening it back up, right?

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.717
Right. Oh, yeah, Yuna!

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.094
Miss Helen asked me to tell
you that she needs to see you

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:04.763
at the Adventurer's
Guild tomorrow.

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:07.349
Huh? I wonder why.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.685
Fine, but it better not
be for something annoying.

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:15.690
[HELEN] Stop, I'm begging you!
I won't let go until you listen!

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:17.359
I refuse! I'm going home!

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.235
You can't make me!

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:19.653
‐‐[HELEN] Miss Yuna!
‐‐[YUNA] Let me go!

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:21.905
What the hell's
goin' on out here?

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:26.326
‐‐[YUNA yelps]
‐‐[HELEN] Oh! Perfect timing!

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:27.828
[YUNA ]
A new opponent.

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:28.787
What's wrong?

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:30.330
Excellent question, Guildmaster.

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:31.748
Miss Yuna was
personally asked to

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.125
fulfill a request to
visit Lord Foschurose.

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.460
However, she refused to go

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:37.420
without hearing
any of the details.

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:38.588
Look, you and I both know

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.508
that there's no way this is
going to be a normal quest.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.759
[HELEN sighs]

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:46.888
Nobles and royalty are
the type of lowlife jerks

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.973
who lock away or kill people

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:50.475
the moment they feel even
a tiniest bit slighted.

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:51.977
And if they happen
to see a woman they desire,

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.270
they'll want her body
and threaten her

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:54.271
if she dares to refuse,

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:56.565
or they accuse innocent
people of being criminals,

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:59.276
stealing money from commoners
to line their own pockets.

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:00.610
They're all just
filthy rich people

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:04.114
who use their money to do
whatever they want, right?

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:07.033
[YUNA] At least that's how they
are in every game I've played.

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:08.451
[YUNA] Plus they give out,
like, the worst quests

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:09.953
that end up taking forever
and a day to complete...

00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:11.913
Do you see what I've
been dealing with here?

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:15.500
Indeed... Yuna, you're
actually correct!

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:16.293
No, duh!

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:17.502
What? Hold on!

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.421
While there are
some lords like that,

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:21.256
our lord is not one of them.

00:06:21.298 --> 00:06:23.592
Cliff Foschurose is
a kind and wonderful lord

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:25.302
who puts his people first.

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:27.137
[YUNA]
Uh...

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:29.055
Please go. If you refuse,

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:32.058
it will affect the trust
that people put in our guild.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:34.436
[YUNA]
Hm.

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:36.563
You are, of course,
free to refuse if you wish,

00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:39.316
but I would suggest making plans
to live elsewhere in the future.

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:41.192
[YUNA grunts]
Whoa, bold threat!

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.862
Okay, fine. I'll go and see him.

00:06:43.904 --> 00:06:46.656
[HELEN] Yay, thank you
for agreeing, Miss Yuna!

00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:53.330
[TIERMINA panting]

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.543
Mommy.

00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:01.630
I don't get it.
She wasn't this bad yesterday!

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:02.923
[TIERMINA groans]

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:04.424
I'm gonna go get some medicine.

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:07.010
You stay here and
keep an eye on Mom!

00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:09.596
Ah. Hurry back, Sis.

00:07:09.638 --> 00:07:11.681
[door opens, closes]

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:23.944
[LALA]
Master Cliff.

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:26.529
The adventurer,
Lady Yuna, has arrived.

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:28.448
[CLIFF]
You may enter.

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:37.958
[YUNA]
So this is the lord of Crimonia.

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:47.008
Hello, my name is Yuna.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.969
How may I be of service
to your lordship?

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.180
Please, that's quite enough.
We can drop all the formalities.

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:54.975
My name is Cliff Foschurose.

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:56.476
I've heard a lot about you.

00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:57.894
You've defeated
a hundred goblins,

00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:00.522
their king, and even
a black viper, that right?

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:01.398
[CLIFF chuckles]

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:03.316
Yeah. What's up with the laugh?

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:04.985
My apologies.

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:09.489
I'm just surprised that you
really are dressed like a bear.

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:11.616
[YUNA]
Dumb, snooty nobles!

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:13.410
So did you need
help with something?

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:15.787
No, I just wanted to
meet the rumored bear.

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:18.248
My daughter is particularly
interested in you.

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:19.457
Your daughter?

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:20.291
That's right.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:22.252
You see, not long ago,
she happened to catch sight of

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:24.587
a cute bear adventurer
walking around town.

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:26.798
Ever since then, if I get
a new report about you,

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.383
it makes her extremely happy.

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:29.843
It's adorable, really.

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:31.970
But what about
privacy protection laws?

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:33.346
[CLIFF]
Ah?

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:36.641
[YUNA] He's not nearly as uppity
as I thought he would be.

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:39.394
[NOIR]
Father! Is the bear really here?

00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:41.396
[gasps]

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:42.731
Uh...

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:44.691
Don't just barge in, Noa!

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:48.403
[NOIR] My apologies, Father.
I couldn't contain myself!

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:51.740
Miss Bear! It's nice to
meet you. I'm Noir Foschurose!

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:53.575
Feel free to call me Noa!

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:55.994
Okay. The name's Yuna.

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:58.747
So will you just call me that
instead of Miss Bear please?

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.373
Oh, yes, I'd love to!

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:02.667
Miss Yuna it is!

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.629
What's up?

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:07.922
[NOIR]
Um.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:11.301
I was wondering if it
would be okay to hug you?

00:09:11.342 --> 00:09:12.927
Sure. Go for it.

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:15.180
Hooray! Thank you so much!

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.931
[YUNA gasps]

00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:21.186
You're so soft and fluffy.

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:24.189
Also, you smell amazing!

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.524
[YUNA] Just like Fina.
Between her and Noa

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:29.736
I feel like I'm racking
up the little sisters.

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:33.615
[YUNA] So then I shot some
fire balls into its mouth

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:35.992
and cooked that
baby from the inside.

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:37.744
Black Vipers have
super tough skin,

00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:40.121
but their insides are
still soft and vulnerable.

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:41.247
Amazing!

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:44.209
I wish that I could have seen
you do all that in person!

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.086
Do you have any more stories?

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:47.545
Let's see.

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:50.381
I already told you what happened
with the goblin king, right?

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:51.883
Yes! It was great!

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:55.095
Can you tell me any stories from
some of your other adventures?

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:58.139
Maybe? But I already told
you about the goblin king

00:09:58.181 --> 00:10:00.975
and we covered how I took out
the tiger wolves earlier.

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:02.393
Sorry, I'm fresh out.

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:03.812
Aw, seriously?

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:06.064
How do you know if I'm even
telling you the truth, kid?

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:08.191
Everything I just told you
could be a big fat lie.

00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:09.359
[NOIR]
It's not!

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.029
Your stories don't sound like
lies to me. I believe you!

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:15.782
Oh, that's right!

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:19.786
Miss Yuna, may I
ask for a favor?

00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:21.287
Go!

00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:25.834
Wow! They're real bears!

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:28.878
They're huge! I can't
wait to pet both of them!

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.672
No, my lady, you mustn't!

00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:31.881
It isn't safe for you!

00:10:31.923 --> 00:10:33.842
It's all good.
My bears are super friendly

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:36.219
and they won't bite.

00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:38.263
Are you sure? [gasps]

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:39.681
Wait! My lady!

00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:41.349
[NOIR]
How cute!

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:42.475
You're such good bears!

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:43.643
Wanna ride them?

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:45.562
[NOIR gasps]
Can I really?!

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:47.230
[YUNA]
Mm‐hm.

00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:49.774
[NOIR laughs]

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:52.569
You can ride them around
the mansion one time, okay?

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.489
[NOIR]
Thank you very much! I'm off!

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:58.449
[LALA] Wait for me!

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.869
Be careful!

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.371
[CLIFF]
Ah, so this is where you were.

00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:06.499
My goodness, Lala
always worries so much.

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:07.625
Are you really sure you should

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.460
be putting this
much trust in me?

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:10.336
Oh, believe me‐‐

00:11:10.378 --> 00:11:12.547
I've heard my fair share
of ridiculous reports

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:13.923
about you floating around.

00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:15.758
But worry not,
I've done my research

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.677
regarding you,
and your bears, too.

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:18.970
I took quite a few precautions

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:21.055
before introducing
you to my daughter.

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:23.057
I'm glad to hear it.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:27.187
So about those bears of yours...

00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:29.647
May I ride one
of them, as well?

00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:33.943
Uh... Sure, I guess.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.157
[NOIR laughing]

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.202
[CLIFF]
Hello, little bears!

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:44.245
‐‐[KUMAYURU, KUMAKYU] Hmph!
‐‐[CLIFF] Aw...

00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:47.916
Wow! You're both so talented!

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:51.711
[YUNA]
She fell asleep.

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:53.504
[CLIFF]
She's had an eventful day.

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:54.714
You have my thanks.

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:57.342
By the way, Yuna, there's
something I wish to discuss.

00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:58.176
[YUNA]
Hm?

00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:01.179
As you may already be aware,
His Majesty will be celebrating

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:03.514
his 40th birthday next month.

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:04.432
Nope, news to me.

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:06.434
[CLIFF]
Uh, no worries.

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:08.728
Anyway, there will
be a celebration party

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.688
for His Majesty,
but unfortunately,

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.149
I've yet to find an
appropriate gift for him.

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:14.442
Okay, then. So what?

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:17.278
Um, if possible, I would
like to take the mana gem

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.322
from the black
viper off your hands.

00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:22.617
I will compensate you
properly for it, of course.

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:25.745
Well, I'd prefer to hang
onto it for right now.

00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:27.789
Right, I see...

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:31.668
Wait. I know.

00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:33.586
What about this thing?

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:36.673
I picked this bad boy up
when I defeated the goblin king.

00:12:36.714 --> 00:12:37.757
It's gift‐worthy.

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:40.468
[CLIFF gasps]
The sword of a real goblin king?

00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:47.267
That's amazing.
This is a rare item.

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:49.352
It's rather unusual
to find a goblin king

00:12:49.394 --> 00:12:52.105
in possession of
a sword such as this.

00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:53.147
Whoa, really?

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:54.023
[CLIFF]
Yes.

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:56.442
And you're fine
with giving it away?

00:12:56.484 --> 00:12:59.612
[YUNA] It's cool. How much
is it usually worth?

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:01.864
Well, to be honest,
I'm not entirely sure.

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:04.450
You see, that's how
rare this item is.

00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:07.203
But I would be more than
willing to negotiate with you.

00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:08.746
Please, just name your price.

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:12.125
[YUNA]
Hmm... I don't really know.

00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:14.252
[YUNA] It's not like I'm
hurting for money or whatever,

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:16.796
but I can't just
give it away for free.

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:20.133
I intend to compensate
you fairly. You have my word.

00:13:20.174 --> 00:13:21.092
I've decided.

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:22.760
You can just have the sword,

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:25.179
but in exchange,
you gotta owe me a favor.

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:26.806
[CLIFF grunts]
Favor?

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:27.890
That's right.

00:13:27.932 --> 00:13:28.891
I bet a lord like you

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:31.644
can do all kinds of weird,
secret, things, huh?

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:34.188
[gasps] Excuse me,
I am not that kind of lord!

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.982
Such a crass assumption.

00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:37.900
Hey, I'm just kidding around.

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:40.028
It'd nice to know that
I can count on your assistance

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:42.530
if I get caught in a sticky
situation, or something.

00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:44.490
If you can't help,
you can refuse.

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:46.576
Is that really the
only thing you want?

00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:47.869
For sure.

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:50.038
All right, then.

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:51.748
I, Cliff Foschurose,

00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:54.917
swear to help you as long
as it is in my ability.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.462
So dramatic.

00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:14.020
[FINA panting]

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:16.647
[FINA]
Mom, please hold on!

00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:24.072
I wish that you could stay
the night with us, Miss Yuna.

00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:26.282
I'll come visit again, 'kay?

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:28.076
Yay! I'll be waiting!

00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:31.120
She's welcome anytime, right?

00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:33.915
Yes, of course!
Please, come visit!

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:35.708
You and both your bears!

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.251

Mm‐hm.

All right, see ya later.

Aw, it's startin' to rain.

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:54.644
[YUNA grunts]
Strange.

00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:57.605
Hey, Fina, what's up?

00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:03.569
What's the matter?

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:04.737
Please help!

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:06.114
[gasps]

00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:08.199
It's my mom! She's...

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:10.660
I don't know what to do, Yuna!

00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:15.373
[crying]

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:16.749
Hey, just calm down 'kay?

00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:18.292
Now, tell me what's going on.

00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:20.086
You remember how my mom is sick?

00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:23.339
Well, she suddenly got worse,
and none of the medicine seems

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:25.133
to be doing anything for her.

00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:27.260
Uncle Gentz went to look
for different medicine,

00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:28.761
but he hasn't come back yet.

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:30.930
Now, I don't know
what we're gonna do.

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:32.849
So I came here.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.518
Please help me, Yuna!

Yuna, you're here, too?

00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:06.591
[YUNA]
Yeah, Fina came by my house.

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:08.593
Were you able to
find any medicine?

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:11.345

I'm so sorry.

His clothes are covered in mud.

He must have run all over town
trying to find medicine for her.

Poor Mommy! [wails]

00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:38.206
You mind if I take a look?

00:16:38.247 --> 00:16:40.500
Can you help her?

00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:41.751
Yeah, maybe.

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:43.794
I can try to heal
her with magic.

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:46.255
You can heal her?

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:47.465
I don't know.

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:51.010
But the only way to be certain
is to try it and see.

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:53.554
Then, please, do it.

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:55.181

Mm.

00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:23.584
She's regained consciousness!

00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:26.754
[YUNA]
She is awake. Still, though...

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:28.589
‐‐[TIERMINA groans]
‐‐[SHURI] Mommy!

00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:31.342
[YUNA]
The illness itself isn't gone.

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:33.427
[TIERMINA groans]

00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:34.762
Tiermina.

00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:38.266
[TIERMINA] It's okay.
I'm feeling a bit better now.

00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:40.268
Tell me, are you Yuna?

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:41.769
[YUNA]
Mm.

00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:43.896
I see. You helped Fina.

00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:45.064
[coughs]

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:47.233
That's enough!
Lay down! You need rest!

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:50.861
Yes, save your strength.
With sleep...

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:53.114
...I'm sure you'll get better!

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:58.035
Fina, Shuri, here.
Let me see you.

00:17:58.077 --> 00:17:59.829
[BOTH whimper]

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.540
‐‐[FINA] Mom!
‐‐[SHURI] Mommy!

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:06.794
I'm sorry that
I couldn't do more for you.

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:09.505
I love you.

00:18:09.547 --> 00:18:12.425
No way! I'm the one
who couldn't help!

00:18:12.466 --> 00:18:18.014
[FINA, SHURI sobbing]

00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:21.892
[YUNA]
I'm not done. I won't give up.

00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:24.437
[YUNA]
Healing!

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.650
[coughing]

00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:32.903
Thank you, Yuna.

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:36.490
Because of your help, I saw
my daughters before the end.

00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:38.576
It's not over!

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:40.745
[YUNA] Is there some other
kind of magic I can use?

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:42.997
Healing isn't working.

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:46.626
I can trigger spells with
the proper image in my head.

00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:49.420
And if I imagine the
strength and effect in detail,

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:52.048
then the strength and
effect of the spell changes.

00:18:52.089 --> 00:18:54.675
What do I need to change?

00:18:54.717 --> 00:18:58.804
Hold on. Maybe that's it. I'm
not imagining things correctly.

00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:01.098
[YUNA]
In MMO games, recovering HP

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.101
and curing status effects
are totally different spells.

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:05.436
What's the matter, Yuna?

00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:08.189
If imagining her wounds healing
up or her stamina recovering

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.815
doesn't actually help her,

00:19:09.857 --> 00:19:11.484
then I need to imagine
the source of her

00:19:11.525 --> 00:19:13.736
illness being removed.

00:19:28.584 --> 00:19:30.836
[FINA, SHURI, GENTZ gasp]

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:37.093
It doesn't hurt.

00:19:37.134 --> 00:19:39.178
[FINA, SHURI gasp]

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.682
[exhales] That's great.
I'm glad it actually worked.

00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:43.933
Feeling better?

00:19:43.974 --> 00:19:44.975
Yes, I am.

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:49.355
I'm not tired anymore and
it's much easier to breathe.

00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:55.486
Mommy's okay!

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:57.363
I'm so happy. Thank goodness!

00:19:57.405 --> 00:20:01.409
[FINA, SHURI laughing]

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:04.412
Fina, Shuri...

00:20:04.453 --> 00:20:05.913
[GENTZ]
Tiermina!

00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:07.289
You're okay.

00:20:07.331 --> 00:20:09.041
You're really okay!

00:20:09.083 --> 00:20:11.252
‐‐[GENTZ cries]
‐‐[TIERMINA] Hey now.

00:20:11.293 --> 00:20:14.004
[FINA] Um, Uncle Gentz,
you're kinda crushing all of us.

00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:15.840
Oh! I'm sorry, girls!

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:17.508
Aw, Uncle Gentz is crying.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.968
No! These are just raindrops!

00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:22.179
[TIERMINA giggles] Thank you
for your concern, Gentz.

00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:25.766
[GENTZ stammers, chuckles]

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:29.812
[YUNA] You should continue to
rest up and eat a good meal.

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:31.063
You need to
regain your strength,

00:20:31.105 --> 00:20:32.732
so don't push yourself.

00:20:32.773 --> 00:20:35.067
Thank you so much, Yuna.

00:20:35.109 --> 00:20:36.527
Uh?

00:20:38.112 --> 00:20:39.405
[YUNA]
Hm?

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:42.283
Uh. Oh, yeah! I almost
forgot that you've never

00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:44.452
met my little sister
before. This is Shuri.

00:20:44.493 --> 00:20:46.495
Why are you all
dressed up like a bear?

00:20:46.537 --> 00:20:50.374
[YUNA] Mm... Uh, well,
it's just my favorite outfit.

00:20:50.416 --> 00:20:52.001
Sorry I didn't introduce myself,

00:20:52.042 --> 00:20:54.336
but I'm one of your
sister's friends, Yuna.

00:20:54.378 --> 00:20:56.422
Did you just say friend?

00:20:56.464 --> 00:20:59.633
Yuna is actually my boss,
and she saved my life a lot!

00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:01.302
She's a kind person.

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:03.137
What? You don't
consider us friends?

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:04.680
We've been through
so much together,

00:21:04.722 --> 00:21:05.598
and you even helped me

00:21:05.639 --> 00:21:07.600
when I was lost in
the forest, remember?

00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:10.394
You taught me about the city
and showed me everything,

00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:13.439
and you've helped me harvest
all the monsters I've defeated.

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:15.858
Enough chit chat!
Can I please touch your fur?

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.985
Uh, it's not real fur, but sure.

00:21:18.027 --> 00:21:20.863
[SHURI laughs]
It's so fluffy!

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:22.615
And very cuddly!

00:21:22.656 --> 00:21:24.825
Yuna, I promise
I'll pay you back

00:21:24.867 --> 00:21:27.119
whatever the cost of
Tiermina's treatment is.

00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:28.579
And if I don't
have enough money,

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:29.705
then I can borrow the rest.

00:21:29.747 --> 00:21:30.706
[TIERMINA]
Hold on, Gentz!

00:21:30.748 --> 00:21:33.667
I can't cause you any more
trouble than I already have!

00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:36.754
I'll get a job once I recover,
and then I can pay her back!

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:37.880
I'll pay for it!

00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:39.882
I can harvest your
stuff, no charge!

00:21:39.924 --> 00:21:41.342
I'll do whatever it takes!

00:21:41.383 --> 00:21:42.968
No, I'll take care of the debt!

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:44.303
Just leave them alone, please!

00:21:44.345 --> 00:21:45.429
I'm begging you!

00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:46.764
[YUNA]
What is happening?

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:49.266
Have I somehow turned into
a children's cartoon villain?

00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:51.268
Come on, I'm not gonna
burst into evil laughter

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.521
and steal their first‐born
child as payment!

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:55.815
[FINA, TIERMINA,
GENTZ bickering]

00:21:55.856 --> 00:21:57.525
Look, I don't want your money.

00:21:57.566 --> 00:21:58.609
You don't?

00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:01.487
I came here because
I wanted to help out a friend.

00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:04.990
Do you mean it?

00:22:05.032 --> 00:22:06.659
Thanks, Yuna.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.619
[YUNA chuckles]

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:14.959
[SHURI laughs]

00:22:14.959 --> 00:22:16.794
[YUNA]
You can't put a price on life,

00:22:16.836 --> 00:22:20.256
or on protecting the
people you care about.

00:23:53.015 --> 00:23:56.352
[KUMAYURU]
Kuma.
