WEBVTT

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:19.186
[YUNA] Imagine a game you can
explore as if it were reality.

00:00:19.228 --> 00:00:22.940
I present the first VRMMO RPG:

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:25.526
<i>World Fantasy Online</i>.

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:28.779
[YUNA] Since the game
first launched last year.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.573
I have become completely
obsessed with it.

00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:33.450
A true addict.

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:41.416
[NAVI] Nice to see
you again, Lady Yuna.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:44.336
You have received a present
from the administrators.

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:45.462
Is that so?

00:00:45.504 --> 00:00:48.549
Yes. We have some
special bonuses for players

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.967
based on how much
time they've logged

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:51.677
in the game in the past year.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.096
You may select
whichever chest you like!

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:56.515
[YUNA laughs]
It'd be easier to pick

00:00:56.557 --> 00:00:58.600
if I knew what
was inside though.

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:00.185
This one?

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:05.691
[YUNA gasps]

00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:13.699
[YUNA]
Whoa.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.535
This is the "special bonus"?!

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:18.495
Attack, defense, speed,
and stamina boosts

00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:19.830
based on user level!

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:21.915
Top‐tier physical
and magical resistance!

00:01:21.957 --> 00:01:24.293
Even HP and MP recovery!

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:27.588
Oh, wow. So OP it's crazy.

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:28.589
‐‐[YUNA cackles]
‐‐[YUNA] You could waste

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.049
a village if your level
is maxed out like mine.

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.801
But it looks ridiculous.

00:01:32.843 --> 00:01:34.261
I'd never wear it in public.

00:01:34.303 --> 00:01:37.055
If it's not too much trouble,
we have a simple request.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.057
We'd like you to
please fill out a survey.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:42.227
[YUNA] Hm? Okay, but make
it quick, I wanna play.

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:45.230
[NAVI] All right. "Would you
consider <i>World Fantasy Online</i>

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:46.773
more fun than real life?"

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:48.275
Well, yeah, obviously.

00:01:48.317 --> 00:01:50.902
The real world is
way too much work.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:54.072
[NAVI] "Is there anyone you
treasure in your real life?"

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:57.034
I've never really thought
about it to be honest.

00:01:57.075 --> 00:02:00.037
[NAVI] "Is there something
that you treasure in real life?"

00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:02.164
Uh, money, I suppose...

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:03.498
...for right now.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.833
[NAVI]
"Do you believe in God?"

00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:07.794
Nah, I believe in
myself more than anything.

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:10.631
After all, I'm the person
who got me this far.

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:11.798
[NAVI]
Last question:

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.843
"Do you think your newly
acquired bear set is cute?"

00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:16.595
[YUNA]
Hm? Uh, sure.

00:02:16.637 --> 00:02:18.221
It's cute enough.

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:19.723
[NAVI] Thank you very much.

00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:23.226
Without further ado,
please enjoy the new world.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.950
[YUNA] A forest? But I've
never seen this area before.

00:04:01.992 --> 00:04:03.952
Is it a new part of the map?

00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:07.581
[YUNA]
Huh?

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:17.966
What the heck am I wearing?!

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:23.221
Why did this dumb
thing auto equip?

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:27.225
[sighs] Whatever, I'll just
change back into my normal gear.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:28.059
Hold on.

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:29.519
Why can't I use the controls?

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.271
[screams]

00:04:31.313 --> 00:04:33.815
[YUNA]
What?! I'm level one?!

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:36.693
I don't understand!
I'd maxed out my level!

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:38.653
What happened to my character?!

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.113
Is it a bug? I should log out!

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:42.032
Wait, the button
is missing! No way!

00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:44.493
I can't send a complaint to the
administrators until I log out!

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:45.702
[bell rings]

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:47.913
Mail? From the admins?

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:49.706
Where's the menu, though?

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:51.249
What the‐‐?

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.501
From "God"?

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:55.378
[GOD] Congratulations, Yuna!
Clap, clap, clap, clap!

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.922
Starting today,
you'll be living in this

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:58.715
fabulous new world
that I manage.

00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:00.342
The Bear Set was
a present from me!

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:02.427
I do hope you'll enjoy
what this world has to offer,

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.679
and maybe even fall
in love with it one day!

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.432
'Kay... Is this some
kind of event, or‐‐?

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:08.433
[rustling]

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:10.227
[gasps] A wolf?!

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:12.729
Talk about terrible timing!

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:16.566
[WOLF snarls]

00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:18.568
[YUNA yells]

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.780
It's usually a monster
for beginners,

00:05:21.822 --> 00:05:24.574
but I'm only level one
and have no equipment.

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.284
[roars]

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.286
[YUNA grunts]

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.871
[YUNA]
Oh, crap!

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:34.167
All right, you asked
for it! [yells]

00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:39.756
Poke, poke.

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:43.009
Could this be the legendary
hero's cypress stick?

00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:44.594
Nah, it's way too boring.

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:47.472
Maybe it's my bear suit.

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:49.099
[sighs]

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.851
Huh?

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:52.185
It's still here?

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:52.894
[FINA]
Help me!

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:54.521
[YUNA gasps]

00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:56.690
[WOLVES snarling]

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.196
[panting]

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:05.907
[YUNA] I found her!
Is she an NPC or player?

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:06.658
[WOLF roars]

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.701
Someone, please!

00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:10.704
Uh, uh!

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:11.997
[grunts]

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:17.586
Oh, wow.

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:20.714
I just sorta threw it,
but I'll take the win.

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:23.341
‐‐[FINA gasps]
‐‐[WOLVES snarl]

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:24.926
[YUNA]
Hey. Are you all right?

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:28.889
Yes! And it's all thanks to you?

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.599
You sound kinda unsure.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.351
[FINA whimpers]

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.228
You're not going
to eat me, are you?

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.898
Ew, gross.

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:39.774
But you're a bear, right?

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:43.445
[YUNA]
Hm? Oh, yeah, I forgot!

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:48.283
Is this less scary?

00:06:48.325 --> 00:06:50.785
[gasps]

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:52.412
Not a bear. Promise.

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:53.663
That's good!

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:56.833
My name is Yuna and you?

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:58.543
Oh, right! Of course.

00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:02.339
My name's Fina.
Thank you for saving me!

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:05.800
[YUNA] So, you left
town to gather herbs?

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:09.429
Well, yeah. See,
my mother is sick.

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:13.683
And we don't have really
money to buy medicine.

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:16.394
What? Is something the matter?

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:19.898
[YUNA] No. Actually, would
you mind showing me to town?

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.067
As it turns out,
I'm pretty lost.

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.485
[FINA]
Of course.

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:24.027
[YUNA]
Maybe there are some

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:26.529
other players in town
I could talk to.

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.366
Uh, sorry, before that‐‐

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:31.493
what are you planning to
do with the wolf's body?

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:34.245
[YUNA]
Hm? I guess... nothing?

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:36.164
But that's such a huge waste!

00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:38.708
If you harvest it instead,
then you can sell the pelt,

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.669
meat, and even its mana gem!

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:41.711
[YUNA]
Hm?

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:43.546
[YUNA]
Harvest it?

00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:45.674
[giggles]

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.972
You're good.

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:55.100
Yep! It's how
I earn extra money.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.559
[YUNA] A system where
you can't get drops

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.395
unless you cut up the monster?

00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:01.398
Why would they make
such a disgusting update?

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:02.649
Uh?

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:05.360
[YUNA]
No way. My level went up!

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:09.197
Huh? It looks like I scored
a couple of new skills, too.

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:11.282
Dimensional Bear Box?

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:14.369
Let's see, it says there's
a timeless dimensional space

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:15.704
inside the white bear's mouth

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:17.998
and I can put any
non‐living thing in it.

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:19.958
Cool, that actually
seems super handy.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.918
[FINA] Miss Yuna,
I'm done with the harvesting.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.211
[YUNA]
Wow.

00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:24.921
Uh, thank you!

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:28.008
Here, let me store it.

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:30.343
Neat! So your bear
glove is for storage?

00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:34.264
Yeah, well, something
along those lines anyway.

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:38.351
[FINA]
This is the city of Crimonia!

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:40.937
[YUNA]
I don't recognize it.

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:44.149
Uh, young miss,
what kind of outfit is that?

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.358
[YUNA]
The kind you wear.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.526
Of course.

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:49.029
Well, you'll have to pay one
silver if you want to get into

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.989
the city and don't have
any identification.

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:52.699
I totally have money!

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:54.159
[bell rings]

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.952
[GOD] The money that
you love, love, love

00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:56.870
from your own world

00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:59.122
has been transferred
here into our currency!

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:00.749
Heart emoji!

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.293
[YUNA]
You don't have to say the emoji.

00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:10.800
[YUNA]
This is the adventurer's guild?

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:12.177
[FINA]
Yep!

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:17.140
Hey, Fina. What're
you do‐‐? A bear?!

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:19.309
Hi, it's good to
see you, Uncle Gentz.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.144
This is Miss Yuna.

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:23.104
Oh, right, I see.

00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:24.689
Anyway, I'm sorry.

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.274
We don't have any
harvesting work today.

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:27.025
[FINA]
That's fine.

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:29.152
We're actually here
to sell some items.

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:30.320
This is the stuff.

00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:31.279
[GENTZ yelps]

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:35.241
Uh, Fina, were you the one
who harvested this wolf?

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:37.494
[FINA] Yep! I was in
the forest gathering herbs,

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:40.789
and Miss Yuna came and
saved me when I got attacked‐‐

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.916
Wait, you went to the
forest by yourself again?!

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:45.585
I told you I would gather
the herbs for you, remember?!

00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:49.339
What if something
happened to you?!

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.508
I'm very sorry.

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:53.885
[GENTZ sighs]
Now then, Miss Bear.

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:56.596
Thank you so much
for looking after Fina.

00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:58.515
Well, she helped me out
when I was super lost,

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:00.225
so that makes us even.

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.602
[GENTZ] Here. This is
your payment for the wolf.

00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:03.895
[YUNA]
Thank you.

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:05.605
Let's see.

00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:09.109
It's only fair that I give
you half of it, so here.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.777
[FINA]
Mm‐mm! That's too much.

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:12.070
I can't accept it!

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:15.198
After all, you were the one
who defeated the monster.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.909
But you did all the
harvesting. Besides,

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:20.745
you could use the money to
help your sick mother, right?

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:25.458
That's true, but it's
still way too much!

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.418
Then what if you
showed me around town?

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.255
I could pay you to be my tour
guide and it'll even out.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.090
Um, are you really sure?

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:34.759
Ah‐hah. Fina,

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:38.471
I think it'd be smart to accept
this young lady's request.

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:45.395
Okay then, I will!

00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:48.439
Thank you! I'm gonna
be the perfect guide!

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:54.404
[YUNA] It looks like
a normal town in the game.

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:57.407
But the people and shops
are all unfamiliar to me.

00:10:57.448 --> 00:10:59.909
Something just seems
really off about it.

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:03.872
And for some reason,
everyone is staring at me.

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:08.334
[FINA]
They're staring at your clothes.

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:10.003
The bear outfit.

00:11:10.044 --> 00:11:13.047
Uhh! Crap, I forgot!

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:16.676
[YUNA] I could die
from em‐bear‐assment!

00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:25.602
Is something wrong
with your meal?

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:30.190
[FINA] Mm‐mm. I've just never
eaten food like this before.

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:33.193
Uh, so, yeah, uh...

00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:33.776
Huh?

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:36.279
Can I please take some of
this stuff home with me?

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:39.949
I'd like to share this delicious
food with my mom and sister!

00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:40.909
I don't mind,

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.493
but you should eat
whatever you want.

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:45.330
I can always order some more for
you to take home to your family.

00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:47.665
[FINA] No, that would
cost way too much money!

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:50.126
Look, I said it's fine, okay?

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:51.836
[FINA]
Thank you for the meal!

00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:53.630
[FINA giggles]

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:57.258
All right, then.

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:02.138
[ELENA squeals]
How cute!

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.891
[YUNA] Weird, but not the
worst reaction I've had today.

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:06.726
[YUNA] Um, do you
have any available rooms?

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:08.853
Ah! Yes, we do!

00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:13.650
[grunts] I am way
beyond exhausted.

00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:18.363
I'll just rest my
eyes... for a few hours.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:36.714
[sighs] I can't put
this off any longer.

00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:49.811
[YUNA]
It's really me, not my avatar.

00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:52.939
[NAVI] Without further ado,
please enjoy the new world.

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:57.443
[YUNA] There's no denying.
I'm not playing a game anymore.

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:01.656
I've been <i>isekai</i>'d.

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:04.701
[YUNA]
No matter how hard I look,

00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:07.829
no one has a player
or NPC tag on them.

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:18.548
Oh, well. It's weird, but it's
not like there's any real reason

00:13:18.589 --> 00:13:20.925
for me to go back to
my boring, old world.

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:22.844
So I guess I'll just
enjoy this opportunity

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:24.846
to experience another place!

00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:28.641
And the first thing I'll do
is assess my current abilities.

00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:31.894
[YUNA] There are no
humans or monsters detected.

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.771
Bear Map with
auto‐mapping and Bear Search

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.648
both seem like useful things.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.525
I had even more
skills when I woke up,

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:40.069
I guess sleeping really
does help kids grow.

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:43.698
Now then, it's time
to see what I can do!

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:54.625
Okay, there's that!

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:55.710
Next up!

00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:56.836
[YUNA]
Fire Ball!

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:58.254
Water Shoot!

00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:00.006
Air Cutter!

00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:02.884
Shielding Wall!

00:14:02.925 --> 00:14:05.470
So I can use magic
just by imagining it.

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:08.723
That's not too different
from the game. Hm?

00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:10.683
It says here that bear imagery

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:13.061
will increase the
power of my magic.

00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:14.729
Bear imagery?

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:17.231
Like this?

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:19.150
[yells]

00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:24.697
[YUNA grunts]

00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:27.492
I'd better save that
one for emergencies.

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:30.620
Bear, bear, bear, go!

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:33.331
[YUNA]
Unfortunately,

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:35.458
it looks like all of
my super OP abilities

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.169
seem to be tied to
this lame‐o bear outfit.

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:42.048
Okay. There's only
one way to know for sure!

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:49.514
And pull! [groans]

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:58.856
All right. Looks like I'm
stuck with the bear suit.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.111
[FINA]
Miss Yuna!

00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:04.821
[YUNA]
Oh, hey, Fina.

00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:07.281
Thanks! For yesterday!

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:09.117
What were you
doing outside of town?

00:15:09.158 --> 00:15:10.993
I was just exploring.

00:15:11.035 --> 00:15:14.122
[FINA] Hold on a second! Are
you an adventurer, Miss Yuna?

00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:15.540
Huh?

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:16.374
[FINA]
I'm sorry.

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:18.084
You were so strong when
you fought that wolf,

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.544
I thought you were.

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:21.212
Still though,
I guess that makes sense

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:22.672
because you wouldn't
have paid a silver

00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:24.507
to the guard if you
were an adventurer.

00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:27.135
[YUNA] Hm? Why, do they not
have to pay or something?

00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:28.553
Uh, yeah.

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:30.179
When you register
as an adventurer,

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:31.806
you get a special
identification card,

00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:34.350
and it gets you into
any country for free.

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:36.477
Wow. You sure know a lot.

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:39.105
It's because Uncle
Gentz told me about it.

00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:41.482
I learn a lot from him
since I help out with harvesting

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:43.109
at the Adventurer's
guild so much,

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:44.652
and he runs the
guild's trading post.

00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:45.987
Ah, I gotcha.

00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:47.822
Still, it's pretty
impressive that you can

00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:49.824
do harvesting work
at such a young age.

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:51.576
[giggles] Thanks.

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:54.745
Unfortunately, there hasn't
been very much work lately.

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:56.998
At the Adventurer's Guild?

00:15:57.039 --> 00:15:59.000
[YUNA]
I just got an amazing idea!

00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:02.503
It's the perfect way for me
to enjoy this new world!

00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:05.381
Oh, what a cute bear!

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:06.757
What the heck is she doing here?

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:09.844
I told you guys!
I saw her yesterday!

00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:12.263
[YUNA] Hi, I heard you can
get an identification card

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:13.514
if you become an adventurer.

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.850
[HELEN]
Uhh, yes, that's right.

00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:17.435
It's known as a guild card.

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:19.061
Does that mean
you'd like to register?

00:16:19.103 --> 00:16:20.396
Yeah. So what's the process‐‐?

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:22.440
[DEBORANE] Whoa, now!
Come on, don't tell me

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:25.026
you're actually taking
this kid seriously, Helen.

00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:26.235
This ain't playtime.

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:27.653
If we let a pip‐squeak in,

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:30.573
it'll lower the
standard of adventurers.

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:31.991
[ADVENTURER 2C]
Deborane is picking a fight.

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:34.035
[ADVENTURER 2D] He did that
to me when I first started.

00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:36.412
[ADVENTURER 2B]
He's annoying, but also strong.

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:37.788
Please calm down.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.457
I'll have to report you
to the guild master

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:41.709
if you cause more
problems, Mister Deborane.

00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:43.753
[DEBORANE] Look, I'm just
worried that this little kid

00:16:43.794 --> 00:16:46.172
is gonna be gobbled
up by monsters.

00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:48.633
Kids like her should be
at home with their mommies,

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:52.136
not tryin' to play with
the big boys. [cackles]

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:54.472
If you want, I'd happily
defeat a goblin.

00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:56.891
I'm sure that would
prove my strength, right?

00:16:56.933 --> 00:17:00.645
A goblin, huh?
No matter how weak they are,

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:03.189
a puny twerp like you
ain't no match for them.

00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:06.108
Excuse me. If I wipe the
floor with that goblin dude,

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:07.527
will you let me register?

00:17:07.568 --> 00:17:08.236
Uh!

00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:10.154
[ADVENTURERS gasp]

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:12.990
[grunts] You've got
some nerve for a brat!

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:14.867
Did you just call me a goblin?!

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:17.286
Huh? Are you a hobgoblin, then?

00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:18.454
My bad.

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:21.165
Sometimes it's hard for me to
tell you monsters apart.

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:23.751
[DEBORANE growls]
You're dead!

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:25.336
Let's take this outside!

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:27.922
I'm about to show you what it's
like to be a real adventurer!

00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:29.298
[YUNA]
Bear Punch.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.592
[DEBORANE shrieks]

00:17:31.842 --> 00:17:35.346
[ADVENTURERS murmuring]

00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:40.685
[HELEN] Right, please fill
out this registration form.

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:41.978
[YUNA]
'Kay.

00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:45.273
[YUNA]
My job class?

00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:47.650
Um... bear?

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:48.985
Sure. Why not?

00:17:49.026 --> 00:17:51.028
[YUNA sighs]

[YUNA]
Here. Does this work?

00:17:55.324 --> 00:17:57.827
Yes. You're Miss Yuna.

00:17:57.868 --> 00:17:59.370
You're 15 years old.

00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:03.124
And your job class
says, uh, bear.

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:05.459
Yep. Registration is complete!

00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:07.003
[YUNA]
Wow. I didn't think they'd

00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:09.714
seriously accept
"bear" as a job.

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:14.260
So, uh...

00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:15.595
My guild card basically holds

00:18:15.636 --> 00:18:18.264
personal information with,
like, magic or whatever?

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:19.056
Cool!

00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:22.018
You can gain trust from people
by completing various quests,

00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:23.352
which will
eventually lead you to

00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:25.146
quests of higher importance.

00:18:25.187 --> 00:18:27.857
[YUNA] Sounds like
your standard MMO fare.

00:18:27.898 --> 00:18:29.859
So are there quests
for beginners?

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.486
Yes, we have a couple.
Mostly things like slaying

00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:34.196
wolves and goblins‐‐
that sort of stuff.

00:18:34.238 --> 00:18:36.449
[YUNA]
Mm‐hm! Thank you!

00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:42.830
Turns out there was,
like, a whole pack,

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:45.291
so I took care of 'em.

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:46.500
Forty in total.

00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:48.502
Wait. Forty wolves?

00:18:48.544 --> 00:18:50.713
Uh, and it's just you?

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:52.006
You did it all by yourself?

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:53.716
‐‐[YUNA] Mm‐hm.
‐‐[GENTZ] Excuse me.

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:55.051
Comin' through.

00:18:55.092 --> 00:18:59.180
That's amazing, but why
didn't you harvest any of them?

00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:01.641
Well, it's because
I don't know how.

00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:03.142
[GENTZ]
If you need monsters harvested,

00:19:03.184 --> 00:19:05.561
just bring them
to the trade shop.

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:08.773
Also... I have a
small favor to ask.

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:12.443
[GENTZ] I'm an old friend
of Fina's parents,

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:13.986
her mom is Tiermina,

00:19:14.028 --> 00:19:16.155
and her father passed
away a while ago.

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:18.449
[YUNA] That's why you
give Fina harvesting work?

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:19.700
All Fina really wants is

00:19:19.742 --> 00:19:22.370
to help take care of her
sick mother and little sister.

00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:24.580
This is my way of helping them.

00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:28.376
Whoa, gross.
You got a thing for her?

00:19:28.417 --> 00:19:29.919
Don't say things like that!

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.962
I treat Fina like
she's my own daughter!

00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:32.672
I'll have you know

00:19:32.713 --> 00:19:34.965
the only girl I have eyes
for is her mother, Tiermina!

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:36.842
Please forget I said that!

00:19:36.884 --> 00:19:39.136
[YUNA]
So he's into moms, huh?

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.889
The thing is, the guild
kind of has a lot of rules,

00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:43.140
so I'm not allowed to give her

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:45.643
nearly as much
work as I'd like to.

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:47.937
Here's my plan! You two pair up!

00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:49.605
Since you can't
harvest monsters at all,

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:53.442
why not hire Fina to be
your own personal harvester?

00:19:53.484 --> 00:19:56.070
She's a hard worker and
has never been spoiled,

00:19:56.112 --> 00:19:57.071
but when she's around you

00:19:57.113 --> 00:19:59.532
she seems a little more
like a normal kid, Ms. Bear.

00:19:59.573 --> 00:20:01.867
I know she's a hard
worker, so okay.

00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:04.495
But please,
feel free to call me Yuna.

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:08.082
Right. Whatever you
want, Yuna. [chuckles]

00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:12.753
[YUNA] So what's the deal? You
got any more quests I can do?

00:20:12.795 --> 00:20:14.630
Wait, are you serious?

00:20:14.672 --> 00:20:17.091
But you just got back
from your last quest.

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:20.052
Well, I thought I would
exercise a bit before dinner.

00:20:20.094 --> 00:20:23.889
Uhh... Actually, I do
have an emergency quest.

00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:25.641
Someone needs you
to slay a monster

00:20:25.683 --> 00:20:27.476
that's not from this area.

00:20:27.518 --> 00:20:29.770
I believe they said
it's a tiger wolf.

00:20:29.812 --> 00:20:31.522
Whoa, are you for real?

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:33.607
[HELEN]
It's a higher‐ranking monster.

00:20:33.649 --> 00:20:35.317
But since you
defeated 40 wolves,

00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:36.736
you might be able to do it.

00:20:36.777 --> 00:20:39.196
Right, I'll take the job.

00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:40.072
Still...

00:20:40.114 --> 00:20:41.407
[HELEN whimpers]

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:44.034
...is it more of a wolf
or a tiger? I need to know.

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:47.037
Uh, it's exactly
what I said it was!

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:49.457
[YUNA]
Water Bear!

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:57.715
[YUNA]
Done and done!

00:20:57.757 --> 00:21:00.384
The materials aren't damaged
this way, and as a bonus,

00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:02.470
I don't have to see any blood.

00:21:02.511 --> 00:21:05.181
So this is a tiger wolf.

00:21:05.222 --> 00:21:06.307
Nah, it's a tiger.

00:21:06.348 --> 00:21:07.683
[footsteps]

00:21:07.725 --> 00:21:09.643
[YUNA] Oops, guess I should
have been a little tougher.

00:21:09.685 --> 00:21:10.561
[gasps]

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:12.855
[YUNA] Why is another
human way out here?!

00:21:15.858 --> 00:21:18.027
[YUNA gasps]
Fina!

00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:19.612
[FINA whimpers]

00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:22.031
Bear Cutter!

00:21:22.072 --> 00:21:23.866
[TIGER WOLF groans]

00:21:23.908 --> 00:21:25.493
[FINA gasps]

00:21:25.534 --> 00:21:27.536
[TIGER WOLF roars]

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:33.834
Aw, crap! Great,
I totally ruined its pelt.

00:21:33.876 --> 00:21:36.253
I'm so sorry.

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:38.255
That's twice now.

00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:39.715
[gasps]

00:21:39.757 --> 00:21:42.384
[FINA] I'm just trying to earn
as much money as possible,

00:21:42.426 --> 00:21:46.347
so I can help my mom
and little sister.

00:21:46.388 --> 00:21:48.682
[YUNA] That's not an
excuse to be careless.

00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:50.935
You're irreplaceable, Fina!

00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:52.394
[FINA gasps]

00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:54.939
[whimpers]

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.232
[sniffs]

00:21:57.983 --> 00:22:00.444
So what if you come
work with me instead?

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:01.737
[FINA]
Huh?

00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:04.824
[YUNA] I can hunt monsters,
but I can't harvest them.

00:22:04.865 --> 00:22:08.035
You can harvest monsters,
but can't hunt them.

00:22:08.077 --> 00:22:11.080
Wouldn't it make sense
to help each other out?

00:22:11.121 --> 00:22:14.250
We'll work together as partners.

00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:15.918
Please tell me, Miss Yuna.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.711
How is it that
you can be so kind

00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:20.005
when you barely even know me?

00:22:20.047 --> 00:22:22.466
[YUNA]
What a sad question.

00:22:22.508 --> 00:22:23.551
She's just a kid,

00:22:23.592 --> 00:22:25.469
but she's willing to
work herself to the bone,

00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:27.972
and it seems like she gets
into dangerous situations

00:22:28.013 --> 00:22:30.391
without any concern for herself.

00:22:30.432 --> 00:22:32.768
Hey... Miss Yuna?

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:36.021
[YUNA] Mm‐mm! You gotta drop
the "miss" since we're partners.

00:22:36.063 --> 00:22:37.690
[FINA]
Right! Okay!

00:22:37.731 --> 00:22:39.859
Mm‐mm.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.528
You've got a deal.
Thank you, Yuna!

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.029
[YUNA gasps]

00:22:46.448 --> 00:22:49.869
This is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship!

00:23:52.806 --> 00:23:54.850
[KUMAYURU]
Kuma!
