00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:15.140
[SHURI giggles]
Yay, Mommy!

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:16.558
Stop bothering Mom!

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.394
She needs to rest all she
can in order to get better.

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:20.354
It's all right.

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:22.189
It's good for me to
get up and move around

00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:23.607
so I can build my strength.

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:26.860
[YUNA] True. And you need to
eat lots of nutritious food.

00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:28.362
What would be good?

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:30.030
Maybe fresh eggs or something?

00:00:30.072 --> 00:00:31.657
[ALL]
Like real eggs?

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.284
They're so yummy!

00:00:34.326 --> 00:00:36.828
[TIERMINA] Yes, delicious and
nutritious!

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.791
They are good, but eggs can be
really hard to find in Crimonia.

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:42.292
[gasps]

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:45.796
Now that I think about it,

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:48.173
I guess eggs are
a rare commodity here.

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:51.552
So, what's the
best way to get some?

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:54.012
There is Kai's village.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:56.139
But it would be kinda hard
to travel there all the time

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:59.059
even if I rode on
Kumayuru and Kumakyu.

00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:02.354
Aw, man, I just wish I
could eat eggs more often.

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:04.940
I beat that black
viper not long ago.

00:01:04.982 --> 00:01:07.943
Maybe I picked up
some cool, useful skill.

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:10.529
Not that things are
ever that convenient.

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.823
[gasps]

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:15.784
[YUNA]
Bear Transfer Gate?

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:50.420
[YUNA]
Take care of yourself, kid

00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:52.297
[KAI]
Thanks! You, too, miss!

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:55.133
[YUNA] We had that
beautiful, storybook ending.

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.302
Who knew I'd come right back?

00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:59.680
You can visit us anytime, Miss!

00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:01.515
Here. Fresh kokekko eggs!

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:02.808
[YUNA]
Thanks a lot, kid.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:03.600
Fair warning,

00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:06.436
I'll probably be back soon
to buy even more from ya.

00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:08.939
Come on, I keep telling
you that I can't take money

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.066
from the person who saved
our village, remember?

00:03:11.108 --> 00:03:13.068
[YUNA] These are completely
different circumstances.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.319
It's a business transaction,

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:17.072
so I intend to do things
properly, ya got it?

00:03:17.114 --> 00:03:18.031
[KAI]
Uh...

00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:21.535
[YUNA]
Alrighty, then. See ya later.

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:23.787
Yep, safe travels!

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.205
That's weird.

00:03:25.247 --> 00:03:27.124
No bears?

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:34.214
Awesome, it looks
like both people

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:36.007
and monsters avoid this area.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.343
It's perfect for what I need.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.057
[YUNA]
Heh! Installation complete!

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.809
It's warp time!

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:51.732
Hey, Fina, you in here?

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:53.692
Uh‐huh! I'm just finishing up.

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:56.278
Here's everything
I harvested today.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.447
[YUNA] Is it just me,
or is her harvesting

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:00.741
technique getting
better by the day?

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:02.617
The whole spread looks
excellent as always.

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.078
Here's your regular pay,
plus a little bonus.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.498
A bonus? Are these real eggs?

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.126
[YUNA] Yep, your mom
needs the nourishment, right?

00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:13.712
I mean, she does. And look,
I appreciate the thought,

00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:16.089
but this is way too expensive!

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:18.091
Actually, it's
pretty affordable.

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:19.426
The reason it's
so expensive here

00:04:19.468 --> 00:04:21.845
is because of the cost to
transport the item safely.

00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:23.180
But the eggs themselves
are something that

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.766
you can easily buy with
just your normal earnings.

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:27.184
Are you serious?

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:28.852
[YUNA] And since I
transported them myself,

00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:29.978
it was super cheap.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.897
Yuna, you can't keep doing that!

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:34.316
What about Kumakyu and Kumayuru?
It's not fair to them.

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:37.194
[YUNA] Nah. It only takes me
ten minutes to get there.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:38.570
Really?

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:40.155
[YUNA]
Come on, I'll show you.

00:04:40.197 --> 00:04:41.615
[FINA]
Uh!

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.746
[YUNA] I can go anywhere I've
set up a Bear Transfer Gate;

00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:51.249
all I gotta do is imagine
which gate I want to go to.

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.751
It's cool but
setting up the gate

00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:54.836
can be kind of a pain, ya know?

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:56.588
Hey, Fina. Do you
know of any other

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.382
instantaneous teleportation
spells like this?

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:01.051
No, not a single one.

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:01.968
[YUNA]
Huh?

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.262
[FINA] I've never heard
of such convenient magic‐‐

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.514
not in my whole life.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:07.933
[YUNA] Uh... well, I'm the
only one who can use the gates,

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:10.352
so I'm sure it'll be fine
as long as I don't brag.

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:12.813
[YUNA chuckles]

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.481
Hey, let's play
a game. I call it,

00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:17.943
"Don't tell anyone else about
the Bear Transfer Gate ever."

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.445
Sure. Sounds like a lot of fun.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.370
[YUNA] There are still a lot
of ingredients I haven't found.

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:31.832
My kingdom for some
rice and soy sauce.

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:33.124
[YUNA]
Gimme the usual, please!

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:36.378
You've got it! Only the best
for my favorite bear customer.

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.339
[YUNA] Mm! Not surprisingly,
it smells amazing!

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:40.382
[gasps]

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:42.300
[YUNA]
Hey. What's up with the kids?

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:43.385
[VENDOR 5A]
They're from the orphanage

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:44.845
on the outskirts of town.

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:47.138
Sometimes they come
and loiter around here.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.973
[YUNA]
Why?

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:50.225
[VENDOR 5A]
Hoping for customers' leftovers.

00:05:50.267 --> 00:05:52.853
I can't complain since
it's unwanted food.

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:53.854
[YUNA]
That's weird.

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:56.481
Don't they get some kind
of funding from the town?

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:57.899
Yes, I'm pretty sure they do,

00:05:57.941 --> 00:06:01.528
but from the looks of it,
things must be tight over there.

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:05.490
[YUNA] In that case,
I'd like 30 more kebabs.

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:07.409
Huh?

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.326
Don't do it.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:12.455
Even if you can feed them all
today, what about tomorrow?

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.421
[gasps]

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:21.756

Hey there, do you have a minute?

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.182
Please remember to thank
Miss Yuna before eating them!

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:34.352
[CHILDREN] Thank you so much
for the wolf kebab, Bear Lady!

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:35.896
There's plenty more
where that came from,

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:37.981
so please eat until you're full!

00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:41.109
I'm so sorry if our children
caused you any trouble.

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:43.820
I promise you they aren't
any trouble, Director.

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:44.905
Sorry to pry,

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:48.199
but what's the story with
your financial situation?

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.619
It's strange‐‐we were
receiving financial support

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.828
from the lord of this town,

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.164
but it suddenly
stopped a few months ago.

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:55.457
[YUNA gasps]

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:56.958
[BOW] We were told
that there was no money

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.170
to waste on such an
"unproductive facility."

00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:02.380
[YUNA]
Seriously?

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.466
[BOW] We've been collecting
as much left‐over food

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:07.052
as we possibly can around town.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.054
But it just hasn't been enough.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.889
It breaks my heart
when I hear about

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:14.643
the children having
to beg for food.

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:16.728
Is something wrong?

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.959
You've done so much.
How can we thank you?

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:41.336
I didn't do that much‐‐
just little fixes.

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:43.004
And I had some
extra leftover meat

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:44.547
from all my wolf hunting so...

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:46.841
Miss Bear, are you leaving?

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:48.969
[YUNA gasping]

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.930
Enough! We have to let
Miss Yuna go home now.

00:07:51.972 --> 00:07:53.974
That's right,
and we need to thank her.

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:56.977
‐‐[YUNA chuckles]
‐‐[CHILDREN] Okay...

00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:59.437
Thank you so much, Miss Bear!

Yeah, thanks for
everything, Bear Lady!

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.985
[YUNA chuckles]
I'll be back, 'kay?

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:08.238
[CHILDREN]
Bye!

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:23.586
[KUMAKYU, KUMAYURU squeaking]

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:26.381
Why go through all this trouble
for a bunch of strangers?

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:29.592
No reason. I just think that
children deserve to be happy.

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:32.220
[BOW gasps]
Oh, I see.

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:33.930
By the way, I'm tight
with the lord here,

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:35.348
so I'm just gonna
go file a complaint

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.808
on behalf of the orphanage!

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.643
If he doesn't help, I'll
give him a bear punch or two.

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.311
[BOW gasps]
Please don't do that!

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:41.688
[YUNA]
Huh?

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.648
[BOW] The lord has allowed
us to live on this land

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.483
without paying any sort of rent.

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:46.693
But If we upset him,

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:49.571
the children won't have
any food or a place to live.

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:51.322
Please leave it be.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:54.659
Curse that stupid lord.

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:59.039
I can't help it. I just
wanna bear punch that guy!

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:01.416
[YUNA sighs]

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:02.876
[YUNA]
This blows.

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:04.586
How do I help the orphanage?

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:06.379
[giggles, grunts]

00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:09.716

[FINA]
Hey, Yuna! Guess what?

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:15.055
My mom can actually
move around normally now.

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:17.557
Oh, yeah? That's great news.

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:20.393
[FINA] Uh‐huh, so she's
looking for a job.

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:23.104
I think it's because of the
nutritious eggs you gave us.

00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:25.732

That's correct.

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:15.300
You gotta let the kokekkos
play outside, clean their coop,

I think I get it.

Basically, we'll run the

made from selling the
expensive eggs, right?

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.858
Uh‐huh. Once you get
used to raising them,

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.610
then we'll increase
the number of kokekkos,

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:36.613
which of course means there'll
be even more eggs daily.

Hold on just a moment.

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:40.742
Won't having more eggs
decrease their overall value?

Yeah, that's what I want.
If they stay expensive,

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:46.372
then people might target the
orphanage and the kokkekos.

00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:48.333
Not to mention, I'm going
through the merchant's guild

You have sharp eyes, sir.

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:50.987
[CLIFF]
Don't flatter me.

00:17:51.028 --> 00:17:52.113
If that were really the case,

00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:54.615
I would have noticed what
he was doing immediately.

00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:56.367
This whole thing is my fault.

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:59.245
No wonder Yuna was so angry.

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:01.664
[LOND] It turns out
the entire Roland family

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:02.915
has been using their position

00:18:02.957 --> 00:18:05.251
to cause numerous
incidents in town.

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:07.420
[LOND] So far, we have
discovered occurrences of

00:18:07.461 --> 00:18:11.132
violence, bribery,
abduction of goods, and more.

00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:14.719
[CLIFF] And he's used
his power to cover it up.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.013
Bring that pig
to me immediately!

00:18:17.054 --> 00:18:20.516
It's time he faces
judgement for his crimes.

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.438
I'm glad to see you
in good health, sir.

00:18:25.479 --> 00:18:29.066
It's unusual for you to summon
me so late. How can I help you?

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:30.610
Not that I'm complaining!

00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:31.694
As your loyal subject,

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:33.738
I'm happy to assist you no
matter what time it is‐‐

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:35.906
Please, the only thing
you're loyal to is money.

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:37.950
[ENZ gulps]

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:39.577
Stop playing games!

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:40.703
I know your secret;

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:43.205
you've been embezzling funds
from all over town, haven't you?

00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:45.625
No, why would you make
such a baseless claim?

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:48.336
[CLIFF] That's what I heard from
the people at the orphanage.

00:18:48.377 --> 00:18:51.547
Tch. This is clearly a ruse!

00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:53.549
I'm sure they think
they will get more money

00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:56.177
if they said they never
received it! How sad!

00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:58.387
Honestly, you shouldn't
trust the crazy ramblings

00:18:58.429 --> 00:19:00.348
of those lowlife gutter rats.

00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:02.433
[CLIFF] So then I guess I
shouldn't believe the rumors

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:04.101
that the projects you're
responsible for

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:05.645
have yet to progress either?

00:19:05.686 --> 00:19:08.314
Oh, we're just a bit
behind schedule, my lord.

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:10.733
Perhaps the projects
would progress more smoothly

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:13.444
if you were to give us an
even bigger budget for them.

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:15.821
Really now?

00:19:15.863 --> 00:19:17.406
I doubt that will help you.

00:19:17.448 --> 00:19:20.993
Especially considering my troops
are currently at your mansion.

00:19:21.035 --> 00:19:23.079
[ENZ grunts]
Whatever for?

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.289
I sent them to seize
the evidence of your crimes

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:27.792
and capture members of your
family with whom you colluded.

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:29.752
See,

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:31.337
I couldn't have
you get in my way,

00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:32.922
which is why you're here.

00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:35.257
[ENZ grunts]
You bastard!

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:36.801
You're just a country‐side lord!

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:38.636
How dare you
disrespect the Rolands!

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:40.763
‐‐[CLIFF grunts]
‐‐[ENZ groans]

00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:41.847
You were the one who told me

00:19:41.889 --> 00:19:45.393
not to trust the crazy ramblings
of lowlife gutter rats, Enz.

00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:47.520
I'm just heeding your advice.

00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:49.980
Seems we've wrapped up
the last of the loose ends.

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:51.482
[CLIFF]
Not yet.

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:54.694
There's still one very
important thing to do.

00:19:58.322 --> 00:20:00.032
Please do forgive me.

00:20:00.074 --> 00:20:01.242
The funding for the orphanage

00:20:01.283 --> 00:20:03.577
was only halted because
of my incompetence;

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:05.913
I should have kept a closer
eye on my subordinate.

00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:09.041
No, please, my lord,
there's no need to apologize!

00:20:09.083 --> 00:20:10.209
[TIERMINA]
What in the world did you do

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:13.170
to make the lord bow to
the director like that?

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:16.257
Uh, I don't know
to be honest with you.

00:20:16.298 --> 00:20:19.385
If anything, I thought
I'd ticked him off.

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:21.011
I really am sorry,

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:23.139
and I swear that this sort
of thing will never happen

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.015
to the orphanage again.

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:26.851
That's very kind of you, sir.

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:27.685
Don't worry.

00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:30.104
I intend to immediately
reinstate all the funds‐‐

00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:31.480
just tell me what you need.

00:20:31.522 --> 00:20:34.817
[BOW] With all due respect,
we no longer need to be funded.

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:37.611
Thanks to Miss Yuna's help,
we have obtained a means to live

00:20:37.653 --> 00:20:39.697
without needing your assistance.

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:42.992
Things may not go perfectly, but
we're hopeful for the future.

00:20:43.033 --> 00:20:44.702
And with such
wonderful children,

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:46.704
I'm sure it will be
a bright one at that.

00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:48.873
I couldn't agree more, Director!

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:50.791
[CHILDREN chatter]

00:20:50.833 --> 00:20:52.251
Right, I see.

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:53.753
Well then,

00:20:53.794 --> 00:20:56.297
will you at least let me
do some renovations?

00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:58.924
It seems someone was kind
enough to patch things up,

00:20:58.966 --> 00:21:01.218
but it still
looks a little shaky.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.471
[YUNA]
Mm! Mm...

00:21:03.512 --> 00:21:05.431
[CLIFF]
Thank you, Yuna.

00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:07.475
If not for you, it might
have been even longer

00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:11.228
before I discovered the
depth of Enz's crimes.

00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:22.364
[YUNA groans]

00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:25.451
What's wrong, Yuna?
Why so rolly?

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:26.494
[YUNAs muffled]
It's just,

00:21:26.535 --> 00:21:29.955
I kind of acted like an
immature brat, you know?

00:21:31.165 --> 00:21:32.541
I mean, I bailed
out the orphanage,

00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:34.168
labeled the lord as
some kind of evil jerk

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:35.753
without really
investigating things,

00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:37.630
and then got
childish revenge on him

00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:39.507
by refusing to sell him eggs.

00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:41.217
I'm the worst.

00:21:41.258 --> 00:21:45.679
I hate everything.
I'm so embarrassed I could die!

00:21:45.721 --> 00:21:47.598
[giggles] Mom told
me what you did.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.974
How you helped out
the town's orphanage

00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:50.476
when they were in trouble.

00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:53.395
Sometimes I saw those
children standing around town

00:21:53.437 --> 00:21:54.855
begging for food.

00:21:54.897 --> 00:21:56.232
But the worst part of it

00:21:56.273 --> 00:22:00.027
was knowing that there was no
way I could really help them.

00:22:00.069 --> 00:22:01.904
[FINA] You were different
though, Yuna.

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:05.032
You were able to save those
children, and in the process,

00:22:05.074 --> 00:22:08.244
you made some bad people
pay for their crimes.

00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:10.496
I mean, that's pretty
amazing if you ask me.

00:22:10.538 --> 00:22:11.872
Uh!

00:22:14.792 --> 00:22:19.004
[FINA chuckles] Thank you for
doing such a good job today.

00:22:19.046 --> 00:22:20.965
[YUNA]
Mm.

00:23:52.514 --> 00:23:55.017
[KUMAYURU]
Kuma.
