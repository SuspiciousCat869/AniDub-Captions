[NOBLE 9A gasps]

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:28.820
It's delicious!

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:31.865
Attention everyone this
dessert is called pudding!

00:00:31.907 --> 00:00:34.326
I was recently introduced
to it and I wanted to share it

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:36.828
with all the people at my
birthday celebration.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.998
I do hope that you'll enjoy it,
so please give it a try!

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.750
‐‐[NOBLE 9B] Happy Birthday!
‐‐[NOBLE 9C] It is delectable!

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:43.252
[NOBLE 9D]
Thank you, Your Majesty!

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:46.004
Man, I had to make
over 200 servings of it,

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.257
but it's not easy
to say no to a king.

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:49.633
Uh?

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.010
[FLORA giggles]

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.804
[YUNA chuckles]

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:58.475
Well, it's done.

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:36.281
[FINA] Now that the king's
birthday celebration is over,

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:39.117
we're just enjoying the time we
have left in the royal capital.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.079
We've been staying in the
bear house that Yuna made.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.499
Sometimes Lady Noa and
Lady Misa come to visit.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.792
[grunts]

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:50.212
[FINA] Or Yuna goes to help Lady
Shia with her sword training.

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:54.007
[FINA] Occasionally,
we all have tea together.

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.386
Lots of people come and go
so it's always very lively.

00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:00.347
But the biggest surprise...

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.433
...was when the king and
the princess came to visit.

00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:15.612
[YUNA grunts]
Fina? Is something wrong?

00:03:15.654 --> 00:03:18.365
No, but the king and his
daughter came to visit you.

00:03:18.407 --> 00:03:20.659
That means they must
think you're amazing, Yuna.

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:23.620
I doubt it. I just happened
to meet them at the castle.

00:03:23.662 --> 00:03:26.957
Even still, them coming
here seems pretty rare.

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:38.176
[YUNA] I'm thinking about
heading back to Crimonia soon.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.011
[FINA gasps]

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:41.430
[YUNA]
What's the matter?

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:44.015
[FINA] It's nothing.
I just feel like you and I

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.518
haven't done very
much together lately.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.854
Yeah, I guess
I've been kinda busy.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.188
So that's why

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.816
I was hoping we could go and
do some sight‐seeing together

00:03:52.858 --> 00:03:56.236
before we have
to head back home.

00:03:56.278 --> 00:03:57.654
What do you think?

00:03:57.696 --> 00:03:59.114
Sure, that's cool with me.

00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:01.908
Let's make that our plan for
tomorrow, and really have fun!

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.369
[gasps] Okay!

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:08.665
We still need to get some
souvenirs for everyone.

00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:10.292
We should go to
the marketplace then!

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:11.793
A bear!

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:12.627
That's neat!

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:13.545
Wow, she's really cute!

00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:15.839
[FINA]
You're as popular as ever.

00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:17.215
Great.

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.967
Whoa, this is delicious.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.345
Mine is, too! Ahh!

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:25.724
Here!

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.771
‐‐[FINA giggles]
‐‐[YUNA] Delicious!

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:32.814
I will buy here
all the way to there.

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:34.357
Wow, that's a lot.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:36.526
Oh, it's for all of the
kids at the orphanage.

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:37.486
[FINA gasps]

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:39.696
Huh, I've never
seen this before.

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:43.033
It's kinda like a cross between
an eggplant and a cucumber.

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:43.867
Weird.

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:46.661
I wonder if you could use
it in one of your recipes.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:50.207
[YUNA] I'm not sure, but
I'll buy some, just in case.

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:52.250
[FINA] So why won't
you open a restaurant?

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.044
[YUNA]
Come on, not you, too!

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.796
[FINA]
Sorry. But if you did that,

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:58.089
then I could eat your
cooking whenever I wanted!

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:00.550
Look, I don't mind cooking
when it's for fun,

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:03.011
but having a business
would be a real hassle.

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:04.095
And why is that?

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.681
Because then you have to make,
like, a ton of food each day,

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:08.391
and that'd be way too much work.

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:09.851
Oh, makes sense.

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:10.685
Plus...

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:11.770
Oh, there's more?

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:13.980
...I couldn't go on adventures.

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.148
[FINA gasps]
Which also means that

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.484
I wouldn't have any
more harvesting work.

00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:18.902
My point, exactly.

00:05:18.944 --> 00:05:20.904
Y'see? I just can't do it.

00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:23.990
[FINA]
Mm‐mm! That's right, you can't.

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:27.035
[YUNA yawns]

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:37.128
[stomach rumbles]

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.296
[gasps]

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.798
[gasps]

00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:45.637
[BOTH laugh]

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:47.347
Sounds like it's
time for some lunch.

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.474
Yeah. What should we eat?

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:52.894
Uh... I know just the place.

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:56.940
[FINA] Oh, yeah,
we ate here the first day!

00:05:56.982 --> 00:06:00.318
[YUNA] Yep! I thought we should
visit again before heading back.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.862
What's this?

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:03.697
Are you sure it's
the right place?

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:05.240
[YUNA]
I mean, it should be.

00:06:05.282 --> 00:06:07.534
Did they really
shut down that fast?

00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:08.660
[YUNA. FINA gasp]

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.829
That should do it. Huh?

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:14.541
[MORIN] You've come in
here before, haven't you?

00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:15.834
My daughter and I thought that

00:06:15.876 --> 00:06:18.044
your bear costume
was simply adorable.

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:21.756
Oh, pardon my rudeness.
My name's Morin and you are?

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:23.133
You can call me Yuna.

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:24.384
And I'm Fina.

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:27.095
I see. Those are
beautiful names.

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:29.848
So, uh, why'd you close?

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.725
I'm afraid that
we lost our shop.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.351
We were unable to
pay back the money

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.437
we borrowed when
we first opened.

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:37.105
You're in debt?

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:38.064
[MORIN]
Yes.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:41.109
We ended up borrowing money
from a kind of shady place.

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:41.943
Before we knew it,

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:45.447
the debt had grown too
large to pay back in time.

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:48.033
But your food was delicious.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.326
Thank you, Fina.

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:51.912
I worked so hard with my
husband and daughter, Karin,

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:53.246
but in the end,

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:55.206
my poor husband
collapsed from overwork

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:56.917
and passed away soon after.

00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.376
Now that we're going
to lose the shop,

00:06:58.418 --> 00:06:59.794
his efforts feel wasted.

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:01.379
[KARIN grunts]

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.298
Well, I'm not ready
to give up just yet!

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.842
We can open up another
shop somewhere else!

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:07.886
Yes! We definitely will!

00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:08.762
We'll clean this place out...

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:10.889
As you can see,
she's very determined.

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:12.641
So we'll just keep trying.

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:14.267
I don't know how
long it'll be yet,

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:16.895
but I hope you'll
visit our new place.

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:20.357
Wait.

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:21.232
[MORIN]
Hm?

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:24.069
I know you're both busy,
but could I please borrow you?

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:30.200
[MORIN] We made everything
according to your recipes,

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:32.494
but I'm not sure if
we did it correctly.

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:33.578
Amazing!

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.997
I've never seen food
like this before!

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:37.791
Well, it looks perfect to me.

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:40.001
Time for the taste test!

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:47.550
[KARIN]
Mm! It tastes wonderful!

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:49.010
Yes, I agree!

00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:51.972
[gasps] Yuna!

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:55.141
Their dishes were
better for sure.

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:58.019
This might seem sudden, but will
you please come work for me?

00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.020
[MORIN, KARIN gasp]

00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:00.855
I knew that the
bread would be great,

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:02.649
but then you made
everything super delicious

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:03.984
on your first try.

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:07.487
So if you're game, I'd like
to put your talents to good use!

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:10.448
Yes, it is awfully sudden.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.742
And we don't really know
each other that well.

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:14.285
I'm not sure about this.

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.371
[YUNA] Here, this is
for travel and supplies.

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:17.497
Oh, my!

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:19.165
[YUNA] I'm planning to
open a shop in Crimonia,

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:20.875
and I want you to
be a part of it.

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:21.835
Uh, you do?

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.920
[YUNA] I'll provide the
essentials and a place to live.

00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:26.798
The only thing you need
to bring is yourselves.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.717
But why would you
do all that for us?

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:30.093
Well, it's going
to sound selfish,

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:33.138
but I just wanna eat more
of your awesome cooking.

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:40.270
[MORIN chuckles]

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:41.771
[KARIN]
I think we should do it!

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:43.523
[gasps] Really?

00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:44.524
[KARIN]
You've always said that

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:47.152
you wanted more people to
taste the bread that Dad made!

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.361
This is our chance!

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:49.946
I guess that's true.

00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:50.864
Even Miss Bear‐‐

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:51.698
[YUNA]
Yuna.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.784
Even Miss Yuna says that
the bread we make is delicious!

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:57.203
There's no way she
could be a bad person!

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:59.748
[YUNA]
Um, that's kind of a low bar.

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:02.917
I wanna keep baking, let's at
least give it a shot. Okay, Mom?

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:05.045
Oh, Karin.

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:08.173
Fine.

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:09.466
What do we have to lose?

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:11.009
[KARIN gasps]

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:15.430
We will accept your kind offer.
Thank you, Miss Yuna.

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:17.223
[BOTH gasp]

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:32.655
[YUNA] Well, it looks like
we'll be busy when we get home.

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:35.950
[FINA] I can't wait for your
restaurant to open, Yuna!

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:42.707
For what I have in mind,

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:44.709
I think we're going to need
a pretty large building.

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:46.211
At least for the main area,

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:48.463
the pre‐furnished
spaces are quite small,

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.048
but you could knock
down some walls.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:50.965
[TIERMINA]
Um.

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:52.467
[MILAINE]
What about this one?

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:55.303
[YUNA] Mm... Nothing
facing the main street.

00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:57.263
I'm worried about all the dust.

00:09:57.305 --> 00:09:58.181
Yuna.

00:09:58.223 --> 00:09:59.682
‐‐[YUNA] This place?
‐‐[MILAINE] Let's see.

00:09:59.724 --> 00:10:02.769
It's not bad, but it's really
far from the center of town.

00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:05.063
You'd get fewer customers.

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.189
[YUNA]
Good point.

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:07.148
[MILAINE]
Would this work?

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.025
‐‐[YUNA] Where's that?
‐‐[TIERMINA] Uh, hello?

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:10.068
‐‐[YUNA] Hello.
‐‐[MILAINE] Hi.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.113
[TIERMINA grunts] Why am I
a part of this meeting again?

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:14.697
[YUNA, MILAINE]
Hm?

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:16.324
I've decided to
open a restaurant.

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:19.410
And we'll need you to manage
the operations of it, naturally.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:21.746
[TIERMINA gasps]
Wait. You're serious?

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:24.749
But I'm already handling the
eggs sales at the orphanage.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.960
Well, if it helps,
you'll be getting a pay raise.

00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:29.087
Oh, that's very generous of you.

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:30.588
Ah! But I refuse;

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.049
I'm far too busy managing
all of the egg sales.

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:34.717
Work is a lonely creature.

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:37.720
That's why it's drawn to people
who already have a lot of it.

00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:40.014
Sorry, but that's a
terrible line of thinking.

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:41.516
[YUNA]
Hey, I found a place.

00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:42.642
Which one is it?

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:43.560
[YUNA]
There's plenty of space

00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:46.354
and it's a reasonable distance
from the center of town.

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:49.232
[MILAINE] It has a large kitchen
and a downstairs pantry.

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:51.317
You've picked out
an excellent building.

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:52.402
That's our Yuna.

00:10:52.443 --> 00:10:54.154
Great, I'll take it.

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:55.572
Right. Miss Tiermina and I

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:57.532
will go over the
details of the purchase.

00:10:57.574 --> 00:11:00.285
You act as though
I've accepted the job.

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:02.162
[sighs]

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:05.248
All right then. What's a
little more responsibility?

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.250
[YUNA]
Mm‐hm!

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:20.013
So, Mom, what do you think
the new shop will be like?

00:11:20.054 --> 00:11:21.181
I don't really
care what it's like

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:23.266
as long as you and I can
bake tasty bread together‐‐

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:25.643
[YUNA] We're here!
What do you guys think?

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:28.229
[KARIN, MORIN gasp]

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:30.732
[YUNA]
Pretty cool, huh?

00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:33.735
[BOTH scream]

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.114
Check it out. It used to be
a mansion for some old nobles.

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:38.948
A mansion?

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.325
For nobles?

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:41.367
[YUNA]
We can turn this room

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:43.912
into an eating hall
for the customers.

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:47.248
It's got a super big kitchen.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.626
The downstairs
even has a pantry.

00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:51.961
Pretty perfect, huh?

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:55.465
[KARIN] What do you think, Mom?
Isn't it just amazing?

00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:56.841
[MORIN]
It's so big.

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:58.968
Do you think the two
of us will be enough?

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:01.387
[YUNA] That's no biggie‐‐
I've hired more staff for you.

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.223
[KARIN, MORIN]
You have already?

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:05.016
[YUNA] I'll introduce
them to you later.

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:06.726
I'm sure the two
of you are tired.

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:10.563
Why don't you get some rest?
The second floor is all yours.

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.315
[KARIN, MORIN]
Huh?

00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:16.236
[BOTH gasping]

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:21.366
She told us to try
and get some rest here.

00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:24.911
But this place is way
too fancy to feel comfortable.

00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:59.445
[MILAINE] Oh, yeah. I'll need
you to give your shop a name,

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:01.322
so I can register it
with the Merchant's Guild.

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:04.951
A name? That's
a tough call. Hmm...

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:07.912
[YUNA] The truth is I kind of
suck at coming up with names.

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:11.249
Kumayuru and Kumakyu
were just random.

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:13.418
Hey, what do you guys think
I should name the restaurant?

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:14.502
[CHILDREN]
Huh?

00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:15.878
‐‐[CHILD 9A] The Bear Bakery!
‐‐[CHILD 9B] Bear Cafeteria!

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.088
‐‐[CHILD 9C] Bear Pizzeria!
‐‐[CHILD 5E] Bear and Pudding!

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.214
[CHILD 5C]
What about the Bear Eatery?

00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:19.590
[CHILD 5D]
Bear Restaurant!

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.009
[YUNA] Why do they all start
with bear?

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.510
[CHILDREN]
Huh?

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:25.263
‐‐[CHILD 9A] You're a bear!
‐‐[CHILD 5C] Bears are adorable!

00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:27.974
Yeah, but this is a
restaurant you'll be working in.

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:30.018
Not everything's about bears.

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:31.644
Speaking of bears,

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:33.938
I had uniforms
made for the shop.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.356
Uniforms?

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:37.817
[GROUP chuckles]

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:39.694
Show me!

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:41.029
You'll love them.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.113
Whatcha think?

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:43.614
[YUNA]
Should've seen that coming.

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.700
[ALL gasp]

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:46.993
[CHILD 5A]
So cute!

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:48.202
[CHILD 9D]
I wanna wear it!

00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:50.246
[CHILDREN laughing]

00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:52.123
[YUNA]
Hmm...

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:56.294
Don't be so grumpy.
They all love it.

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:58.129
Why do I have to wear one, too?

00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:01.049
Because you're the
manager of the main hall.

00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:06.304
I'm a bear!

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:08.348
No way, this is too
em‐bear‐assing!

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:09.849
[KARIN whimpers]

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:11.809
[YUNA] You don't have to
force yourself to wear it.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.686
We haven't decided if
it'll be our uniform.

00:14:13.728 --> 00:14:14.604
[CHIILDREN]
Huh?

00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:16.564
No fair!

00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:18.316
But we like this outfit!

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:19.901
Everything else is bear themed!

00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:23.279
[CHILD 9H] Please, please,
let us wear this one!

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:24.947
Hey, Yuna! [gasps]

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:25.782
[YUNA]
Uhh...

00:14:25.823 --> 00:14:27.533
[CHILD 5B]
C'mon, say yes, Miss Yuna!

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:28.910
[FINA]
Look at all the bears.

00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:30.119
There you are, Fina!

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:31.996
I'm trying to think of
a name for the restaurant‐‐

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:33.289
got any bright ideas?

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:34.582
[FINA]
Uh!

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:37.043
How about The Bear Shop?

00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:39.754
[YUNA groans]
Oh, come on, not you, too.

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:40.963
[FINA]
Hey, you know what?

00:14:41.005 --> 00:14:43.716
This shop feels kind of similar
to your bear house, Yuna.

00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:45.009
Yeah, you think so?

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:48.888
Yep. Everything about this place
feels really warm and relaxing.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.391
I guess I'd describe
the atmosphere as gentle.

00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:53.017
Like how it feels
when you come home.

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:54.977
A house, huh? I feel ya.

00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:57.980
Homes are kinda
like safe havens.

00:14:58.022 --> 00:15:00.817
Hey, Miss Milaine. I've
chosen a name for the shop!

00:15:00.858 --> 00:15:04.487
[CHILD 9I] Great news!
The Bear Haven is opening today!

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:05.947
[CHILD 9J] There are
lots of delicious foods,

00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:08.366
so we hope you'll stop by!

00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:16.916
Well, opening day is here.
Good luck, you two!

00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:17.750
[MORIN]
Thanks.

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:18.626
[KARIN]
Leave it to us!

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:20.795
[ALL]
Mm!

00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:22.839
[YUNA]
Okay, is everyone ready?

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.341
[CHILDREN]
Yeah!

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:28.719
[gasps]

00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:31.848
[CROWD chattering]

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:34.475
[YUNA grunts]

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:42.358
[YUNA]
There's so many!

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.485
[KARIN] Three puddings!
I hope you enjoy!

00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:46.446
[CHILD 5D]
Here's the pizza you ordered.

00:15:46.487 --> 00:15:48.614
[CHILD 5A]
One hamburger and fries to go!

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:49.574
[CHILD 9K]
Right this way, please.

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:51.868
[CHILD 9L]
Two teas and two pizzas.

00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:54.162
[MORIN] Keep taking the
plates as they get ready.

00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:56.205
But be careful‐‐
some of them are very hot.

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:57.081
[CHILD 9O]
Yes, ma'am!

00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:59.000
[CHILD 9P]
This is heavy.

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:01.210
Oh, wow.

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:03.504
I know! Your
restaurant's a huge hit.

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:05.131
Where did they all come from?

00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:07.675
Maybe our advertising
worked a little too well?

00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:08.718
What was that?

00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:10.428
We may have started
a few rumors.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.846
Helen is helping.

00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:13.473
Hey, have you ever had pudding?

00:16:13.514 --> 00:16:15.933
I heard they sell it here
and that it's simply amazing!

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:17.768
Wow, I can't wait to try it!

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.188
[HELEN] The pizza and
hamburgers are divine, too!

00:16:20.229 --> 00:16:23.065
Everything is. The bread
is just mouthwatering.

00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:25.943
I heard it was made by
a chef from the royal capital.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.236
What's more...

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:29.363
[GIRL 9A] When will we
get to see the bear shop?

00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:30.656
Hopefully soon, honey.

00:16:30.698 --> 00:16:33.701
The whole bear theme has
proven to be a big success.

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:35.620
Yeah, but maybe
a little too much.

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:37.121
At this rate we're
not going to be able to

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:39.373
handle all of the customers.

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:45.213
Miss Morin, what can
I do to help you out?

00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:46.297
[MORIN]
Yuna?

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:47.548
[YUNA]
Mm!

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:50.801
[gasps] Thanks so much, dear.

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:52.762
The children can handle
preparing the pizza dough

00:16:52.803 --> 00:16:53.721
and the meat patties,

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:56.015
so can you please cook them
using the frying pans?

00:16:56.057 --> 00:16:57.350
I'm on it.

00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:03.356
[YUNA] All right, this
will probably cut down

00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:05.107
on the wait times at least.

00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:06.651
But still...

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:10.321
[gasps]

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:12.949
[YUNA] It's no use.
There's just too many!

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.325
Leave the serving to me!

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:15.451
I'll help, too!

00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:17.787
Wait, really? Are you guys sure?

00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:19.622
‐‐[FINA] Follow me.
‐‐[SHURI] We're off! Yay!

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:20.581
[MILAINE]
Thank you for waiting!

00:17:20.623 --> 00:17:21.415
Huh?

00:17:21.457 --> 00:17:25.044
If you want, we're selling
some takeout items over here!

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:28.381
We're so sorry about the
long wait! We're open now!

00:17:28.422 --> 00:17:29.507
This way!

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.842
Please form a single row.

00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:43.104
[FINA] Everyone said
they wanted to help.

00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:44.230
[SHURI]
Yeah!

00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:46.816
[BOTH giggle]

00:17:46.857 --> 00:17:48.234
Thanks so much.

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:49.819
[FINA, SHURI]
Huh?

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.072
Thank you all for everything!

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:21.976
[KARIN, MORIN]
Thanks for visiting!

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:23.102
[CUSTOMER 9B]
It was good, huh?

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:24.937
[GIRL 9B]
Yeah! Let's eat here tomorrow!

00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:26.272
[CUSTOMER 9B]
Sounds like a plan.

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:29.066
[GIRL 9B] They have the
best bread in the world.

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:30.026
[TIERMINA]
Well, good news‐‐

00:18:30.067 --> 00:18:33.195
we sold out of everything
on the menu! Way to go!

00:18:33.237 --> 00:18:34.822
[CHILDREN]
Yay!

00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:37.491
Well, we pulled it off,
and people love the food.

00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:40.119
But this place did not
feel like a "haven" today.

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:42.038
[FINA]
I've never worked so hard.

00:18:42.079 --> 00:18:43.956
[SHURI]
Yeah, my feetsies hurt.

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:46.167
Oh, and one more thing.

00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:49.879
I made some pudding for all
of us to eat once we were done.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.715
[KARIN] Please enjoy, and
thanks for your work today!

00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:55.468
[ALL]
Thanks for your work today!

00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:06.729
What's the matter?

00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:10.024
Uh, mm... Not much, it's just,

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:15.821
I kind of thought this place
would be quieter, I guess.

00:19:15.863 --> 00:19:16.864
[door opens]

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:20.868
[NOIR]
Aww! We didn't make it in time.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:21.994
[FINA]
Lady Noa!

00:19:22.036 --> 00:19:24.413
[NOIR gasps]
What is that you're wearing?

00:19:24.455 --> 00:19:27.083
That's the most
adorable bear outfit ever!

00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:29.251
[FINA] This is the official
uniform for the shop!

00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:30.127
Uniform?

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:32.713
[FINA] Cute, right?
Hey, do you wanna try one on?

00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:34.090
May I, Fina?

00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:35.049
[FINA]
Sure. Go ahead.

00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:36.592
[NOIR]
I shall wear it immediately!

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:37.510
[YUNA]
How was it?

00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:39.053
Terrible, unfortunately.

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:41.013
It turns out that the
interest rate on the loan

00:19:41.055 --> 00:19:44.058
for the bakery was exorbitant
beyond what's legal.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.643
Thankfully, we were
able to catch them

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:49.480
and punish them properly.
Here's the loan document.

00:19:53.484 --> 00:19:54.902
'Preciate it.

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:56.821
I'm happy that I could help.

00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:58.823
[YUNA]
Mm.

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:00.825
[NOIR giggles]
How do I look?

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:02.618
[FINA, CHILD 9Q]
It's adorable!

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.371
[YUNA]
Miss Morin, Miss Karin.

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:06.914
Let's chat.

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:09.625
[YUNA]
Now that it's sorted out,

00:20:09.667 --> 00:20:11.669
you could reopen
your old bakery.

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:16.257
[MORIN] What will happen to
this shop if we go back, though?

00:20:16.298 --> 00:20:19.677
Um, I dunno. I guess we'll
have to hire some new people.

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:21.637
[KARIN] Can you even find
more help that quickly?

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:23.389
Honestly, it'll be a challenge.

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:25.975
But that's our problem
to figure out, okay?

00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:27.476
Here.

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:38.863
Earlier I overheard
a customer tell her mother

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:41.115
she wanted to eat
here again tomorrow.

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:42.324
Huh?

00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:43.868
We can't let that girl down.

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:46.328
She'd be so sad if we
went back to the capital.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:47.413
Yes, that's right.

00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:50.875
What kind of bakers would we be
if we let down our customers?

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:54.712
You're sure? I just thought
your shop was precious to you.

00:20:54.754 --> 00:20:57.840
Yes, but now this place
is precious to us, as well.

00:20:57.882 --> 00:21:00.259
[KARIN]
Mm‐hm!

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:12.146
[YUNA]
A precious place, huh?

00:21:13.397 --> 00:21:18.402
[inaudible]

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.342
[YUNA]
Hm.

00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:19.755
Okay, then! I wonder what kind
of quests there are today!

00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:54.683
[KUMAYURU]
Kuma!
