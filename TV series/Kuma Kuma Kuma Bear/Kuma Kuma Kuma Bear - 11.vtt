00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:13.972
You've discovered one of three
ways to get on my bad side.

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:15.182
Congrats.

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:17.559
One, interrupt me while I'm
eating something delicious.

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:20.145
Two, interrupt me while
I'm in the middle of gaming.

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:23.607
And then, three, interrupt
me while I'm sleeping!

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:26.193
[THIEVES groaning]

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:28.737
[YUNA]
I found you.

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.281
Hello, boys. I'm here to
make you pay for your crimes.

00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:33.742
What the hell are
you talking about?!

00:00:33.784 --> 00:00:36.870
[chuckles]

00:00:36.912 --> 00:00:38.872
[gasps]

00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:42.417
Uh, who're they?

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:45.295
[YUNA yawns]
Hey, Miss Atola.

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:46.630
Good morning.

00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:47.548
Yuna?!

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:48.590
[YUNA]
Get this.

00:00:48.632 --> 00:00:50.717
I caught these two thieves
who snuck into my room

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:53.220
and attacked me while I was
trying to sleep last night.

00:00:53.262 --> 00:00:54.137
[gasps]

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.139
And then, I went to
their secret hideout,

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:59.226
so I could confront
the rest of their gang.

00:00:59.268 --> 00:01:01.228
You what?! For real?

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.063
Yep, and now that
it's taken care of,

00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:04.940
I'm going to go back to bed.

00:01:04.982 --> 00:01:06.650
You can handle the rest.

00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:10.237
[ATOLA grunts]
Whoa, hold on a second!

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:12.739
What now? Can't I
just sleep already?

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:16.159
I'm gonna need you to
tell me the whole story!

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.837
[YUNA]
There you have it.

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.215
I ended up spending the
whole night chasing down thieves

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:56.468
and haven't gotten an ounce
of rest. I'm beyond tired.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.554
Wow. I knew you were strong,
but this is crazy.

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:02.057
Well, to be fair,
my bears helped me out a lot.

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.392
[KUMAKYU, KUMAYURU]
Kuma!

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:07.229
Uhh... Wait, so you're saying
your bears attack other people?

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.647
Only the people who threaten me,

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:09.981
so you should be perfectly safe

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:12.317
as long as you aren't
a bad person or anything.

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.403
[ATOLA grunts]
Right...

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:15.904
[THIEF BOSS 10A groans]

00:03:15.946 --> 00:03:19.658
The last thing I remember is
getting attacked by a she‐bear.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.742
[THIEF BOSS 10A gasps]

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:22.369
Spill it, thug.

00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:23.704
[THIEF BOSS 10A grunts]

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:26.581
Who's in charge
of your operation?

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.378
[ZARRAD] Those pieces
of trash are running late.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.964
When are they going to bring
that bear girl's item bag to me?

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:36.383
It should've been an easy job.

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:40.762
[ZARRAD] Oh, well.
It's almost time to pack up.

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:42.222
This town has
practically run dry

00:03:42.264 --> 00:03:44.850
and there's barely
anything left for me to steal.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.810
Once I get that
ridiculous girl's item bag,

00:03:46.852 --> 00:03:49.354
I'll grab whatever I can
and then I'm out of here.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:50.230
[knocking]

00:03:50.272 --> 00:03:52.190
[GUILDSMAN 10A]
Excuse me? Mister Zarrod?

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.316
[ZARRAD]
What do you want?

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:54.568
Excellent news!

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.903
The thieves blocking the
road outside of town are gone!

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:59.448
Apparently, they were
defeated by an adventurer.

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.032
Say what now?!

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:04.119
We'll be able to reestablish the
trade routes to our food supply.

00:04:04.161 --> 00:04:07.080
The great famine as we know it
is finally over, sir!

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:08.206
The thieves are
being interrogated

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:09.791
by Miss Atola as we speak!

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:11.126
Seriously?!

00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:12.919
Huh?

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:15.547
[ZARRAD]
This is terrible.

00:04:16.882 --> 00:04:19.134
Uh, Mister Zarrad?

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:25.140
[ZARRAD groans]

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:29.770
[ZARRAD] I have to grab
as much as I possibly can,

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:30.896
and then make tracks!

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.355
[ATOLA] Seems like
you're in quite the hurry.

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:33.398
[ZARRAD]
Hm?

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.233
[ZARRAD grunts]

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:36.359
[ZARRAD]
Atola?

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:37.444
Surprise, surprise.

00:04:37.486 --> 00:04:40.989
You have the things that
were stolen by the bandits.

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:43.575
[yawns]

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:44.993
[YUNA]
I'm so tired.

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:48.163
Now how is it that said items
came to be in your possession?

00:04:48.205 --> 00:04:49.664
What? Nonsense!

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:50.874
You must be mistaken!

00:04:50.916 --> 00:04:53.543
Every single thing in this
room was acquired legally!

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:57.088
That's strange;
we heard a different story.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.050
[ZARRAD grunts]
Who are these fools?

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:01.510
[THIEVES]
Mm...

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.637
They filled us in
on all the details‐‐

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:06.681
including how you paid
them for their services.

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:10.060
The "band of thieves" act
was quite convincing.

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:11.102
[ZARRAD grunts]

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.647
You capitalized on
the kraken's appearance.

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:15.941
Then hired adventurers
who posed as thieves

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:17.526
and blocked the
route outside of town,

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:19.361
trapping us from all sides.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:22.155
Then you controlled the food
supply for the entire city.

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:25.283
Meaning that you could then
sell it for outrageous prices.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:28.537
To top it all off, you pocketed
any valuables that were stolen

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:30.622
from the townspeople.

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:31.581
That everything?

00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:33.542
[YUNA yawns]

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:35.836

Ah...

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:44.636
[YUNA]
Oof, that's gonna leave a mark.

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:46.555
Get this man out of my sight.

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:47.889
Right.

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.477
[ATOLA]
Thank you, Yuna.

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:53.562
[YUNA]
Huh?

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:54.813
Without your help,

00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:57.190
we wouldn't have uncovered
the evidence we needed.

00:05:57.232 --> 00:05:59.526
We've suspected that
Zarrad was behind everything

00:05:59.568 --> 00:06:00.735
for quite a while now.

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:02.529
We just didn't
have any solid proof.

00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:05.282
Jeez, couldn't you've just told
me all that from the get‐go?

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:08.118
I wanted to, but it seemed
like every adventurer

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:09.578
from our guild
was working for him,

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:13.123
so I couldn't afford to trust
you until I was absolutely sure.

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:14.958
At least everything's
back to normal.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.460
Now the coastal road
can be reopened.

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:18.753
The sea route is still a bust

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:20.547
due to the whole kraken
in the harbor thing,

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:23.466
but, hey, one problem
at a time, am I right?

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:27.095
Suppose so... Yeah.

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:34.895
Way to go kid! Word around
town is that you saved us all!

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:37.355
Now we don't have to worry
about those pesky bandits

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:38.773
blocking the road anymore!

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:41.026
You're amazing, Miss Yuna!

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.736
Aw, man, this is
really embarrassing.

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:45.196
I asked Miss Atola
not to tell anybody.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:49.367
[laughs] Well, squashing a rumor
is like trying to unring a bell.

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.536
Yeah, and the people
from the Adventurer's Guild

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:53.538
already confirmed
your involvement!

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.873
[groans]

00:06:54.915 --> 00:06:56.499
[DEIGHA]
We both wanted to reward you.

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:57.375
Huh?

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:59.169
So we made you a special meal.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.338
Anz, are you done with
the preparations yet?

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:05.258
[ANZ] Yep, it should be just
about ready to go. Lemme check.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.677
[YUNA]
Hm? What's she making?

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:10.305
I guess you'll find
out when it's ready.

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:11.723
[YUNA]
Hm?

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:15.101
[ANZ]
First up, grilled fish!

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:16.227
[gasps]

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.896
[ANZ] And if you're
eating grilled fish,

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:19.940
then you gotta have this.

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:21.608
It can't be.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.443
Steamed rice?!

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:25.278
There's more!

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:28.490
Miso soup and soy sauce, too!

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:29.991
[DEIGHA chuckles]

00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:33.328
So you're familiar with
miso soup and steamed rice?

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.704
Uh, yeah.

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:37.582
That's great! Rice,
grilled fish, and miso soup.

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:40.251
Top your fish off with a
little soy sauce and ta‐dah!

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:42.879
You've got yourself
the ultimate food combo!

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:44.255
[YUNA]
I was expecting fish

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:45.840
because we're so
close to the sea,

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:50.303
but I never imagined I'd see
a complete Japanese meal here!

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.141
[gasps] Real chopsticks?

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:08.989
[heart beats]

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:14.452
How is it?

00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:18.665
Whoa, tears?!

00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:20.667
Is it not to your
taste, Little Bear?

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:21.710
[YUNA munching]

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:25.922
It's delicious, like so
delicious, it's making me cry!

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:33.888
This is it!
It's a dream come true.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.141
You guys have no idea how
long I've been searching for

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.184
the taste of my hometown like
this!

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:40.270
Your hometown?

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:42.731
Wait a second, are you
from the country of Wa?

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:43.982
[YUNA]
Country of Wa?

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:45.233
Yes, am I wrong?

00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:46.735
Well, I'm not from there,

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:48.570
but if this is a good
example of what they eat,

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:49.738
then it seems
like they have food

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:51.573
very similar to my hometown.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.324
And the taste reminds
me so much of home

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.368
that I couldn't
help but start crying.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.788
Ah. I'm glad that you
appreciate it so much.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.832
And I wish that I could
make you even more food

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:02.250
from the country of Wa,

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:04.461
but unfortunately
we're out of ingredients.

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:06.880
Yeah, before the kraken
took up shop in the harbor,

00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:08.339
we got shipments
with ingredients

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:10.633
from the country
of Wa once a month.

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:11.885
[YUNA]
Huh?

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:15.430
[YUNA]
I've gotta defeat that kraken.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:32.781
[YUNA] All I really
know about this thing

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:34.532
is that it's weak to fire,

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:37.577
but I can't even get close
to it because of the ocean.

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:42.415
[YUNA] I could try
fighting it on a boat,

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:44.501
but I doubt that would end well.

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:51.674
How do you guys
feel about swimming?

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:53.760

You're naturals!

Kuma!

00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:05.855
[YUNA] Except... no matter
how good they are at swimming,

00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:07.524
we're gonna be in
big trouble as soon as

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:10.276
the kraken decides
to dive underwater.

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:16.699
[YUNA]
Think, Yuna.

00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:18.868
There's gotta be another way.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:19.994
[BOY 11A]
C'mon, hurry up!

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:21.371
Uh?

Great job! Let's go!

[BOYS laughing]

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:38.179
Okay, Kumakyu!

00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:41.015
This is the moment when
we change bear history!

[KUMAKYU grunts]

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.562
Let's go!

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:48.022
We fly!

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:56.281
A bear that can't fly,
is just a bear!

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.616
[YUNA, KUMAKYU scream]

00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:03.496
[YUNA] Yeah, dumb idea.
Kumakyu is a land bear.

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:04.998
Obviously.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:07.750
[YUNA]
What else?

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:09.752
[GIRL 11A]
Look, Mommy!

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:11.629
My bubble is ginormous!

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:14.757
I see! It's beautiful!

[YUNA gasps]

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:23.099
Check out my air bubble!
Let's do this thing!

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:25.727
Underwater kraken fight is a‐go!

00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:29.606
Now, eat fireballs, you monster!

00:11:33.484 --> 00:11:37.655
[YUNA groaning]

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:42.660
Death by drowning,
no thank you! Bad idea.

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:45.705
[gasps]

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:55.298
Behold, the mysteries
of the East!

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:59.344
The skills of the legendary
Japanese bear‐girl ninja!

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.266
Ugh... This is pointless.
Thanks to the lack of sleep,

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:07.936
I can only think of weird
ideas that end with me dying.

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:10.772
I should really go
and get some rest.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.907
[YUNA]
Hmm... What if I part the sea?

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:21.741
[YUNA]
Hi‐yah!

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.576
[KRAKEN roars]

00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:27.413
[YUNA] Too biblical.
Not to mention, impossible.

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:30.208
[YUNA]
Could I guide it to land?

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.085
[KRAKEN growls]

00:12:32.126 --> 00:12:34.963
Except that there's no point
if I can't keep it there.

00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:37.090
[sighs]

00:12:37.131 --> 00:12:39.259
[YUULA]
Hi there, Yuna!

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.468
[YUNA]
Miss Yuula!

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:41.803
Perfect timing!

00:12:41.844 --> 00:12:44.389
I was actually just about
to go looking for you.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.057
Why, is something the matter?

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:47.892
No, quite the opposite.

00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:50.478
We were able to get some
seafood from a friend of ours

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.272
and we wanted to
invite you over for dinner

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:54.107
to thank you properly.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.443
[YUULA]
Who's ready to eat?

00:12:57.485 --> 00:13:00.196
Fair warning, dinner tonight
is a bit extravagant.

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:04.200
But we wanted to celebrate the
reopening of the coastal route.

00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:07.620
It's a seafood hotpot with fish
and vegetables from Mileela!

00:13:07.662 --> 00:13:10.123
[gasps] It smells so amazing!

00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:11.374
Okay, then.

00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:13.793
[ALL]
Thank you for the food!

00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:16.337
Hotpot. Wow.

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:18.840
[BROTHER 10A] Oh, boy,
I can't wait to dig in!

00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:20.216
Whoa, hold on.

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:22.010
This meal is to thank Miss Yuna.

00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:23.845
We should wait until
she's served herself.

00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:25.179
Uh.

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:27.265
[YUNA]
Nah, it's okay.

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:29.100
You must be pretty hungry.

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:30.643
I don't mind if you go first.

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:34.188
[BROTHER 10A ] For real?
You're the best, Miss Yuna!

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.024
You are a bottomless pit.

00:13:36.065 --> 00:13:37.525
[YUNA, BROTHER 10A chuckle]

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:38.860
[YUULA]
Yuna.

00:13:38.901 --> 00:13:41.070
Now that the thieves
have been taken care of,

00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:43.156
we'll be able to use
the coastal road to leave

00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:46.284
and get more food and supplies.

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:48.536
So good!

00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:50.997
We won't have to worry
about our kids starving.

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:52.498
So thank you for that.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.335
We may not be able to fish, but
at least we can get supplies.

00:13:55.376 --> 00:13:56.919
You've saved us all, Yuna.

00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:59.005
[YUNA]
Aw, it wasn't that big a deal.

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:01.257
Here. Please enjoy.

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:03.384
Oh. Thank you so much!

00:14:03.426 --> 00:14:04.260
[YUULA chuckles]

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:06.012
Looks awesome.

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:09.432
[YUNA]
Squid.

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:11.642
What's wrong?
Do you not like squid?

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:13.353
[YUNA]
Oh, sorry!

00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:17.815
[YUNA gasps]
Delicious!

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:20.276
Good! Glad you like it.

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:22.820
[YUNA] Mm... Man,
if I just had some rice,

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:25.698
I could soak up the
leftover soup with it.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.283
[YUULA]
It's nice, huh?

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:30.328
Sitting together and
cooking food in a big hot pot.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.830
Big pot...

00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:37.960
[DAMON]
What's wrong?

00:14:38.002 --> 00:14:40.463
[YUNA]
No way!

00:14:44.717 --> 00:14:47.220
'Kay, this cliff should be
high enough to keep me safe.

00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:51.599
So let's see. Now I just
need something to use as bait.

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:54.477
It'd have to be pretty big
for a squid that size, though.

00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:56.979
Maybe a giant worm or something.

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:02.735
[gasps] Wait a sec.

00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:05.363
I've got one already.

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:07.448
[ATOLA] You're going
to take down the kraken?

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:08.950
Are you serious?

00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:11.244
[YUNA]
Mm‐hm.

00:15:11.285 --> 00:15:14.122
And just how do you plan
to fight a monster that size?

00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:16.666
It's kinda crazy,
but just bear with me.

00:15:16.707 --> 00:15:18.543
You've heard of hotpot before?

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:19.877
[ATOLA]
Mm...

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:21.796
Say wha‐‐?

00:15:23.881 --> 00:15:26.676
Um, I don't know, Yuna.
It sounds pretty risky.

00:15:26.717 --> 00:15:29.595
Don't worry; I'll be careful and
take things one step at a time.

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:31.431
Hey, so what's your deal?

00:15:31.472 --> 00:15:33.850
Why are you going
so far for all of us?

00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:37.145
I mean, you're not from here,
so it's not your problem.

00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:40.481
There's just something here
I really want to protect.

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:43.067
Do I need a better
reason than that?

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:46.863
Oh, wow, Yuna! I'm so touched.
I didn't realize this town

00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:48.823
and its people meant
that much to you!

00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:50.366
Okay! I'm on board!

00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:53.411
I'll help out however I can,
just tell me what to do!

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:56.164
Awesome, then do you think
you can go find me some rope?

00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:58.416
Preferably as long as possible.

00:15:58.458 --> 00:15:59.250
Also,

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:01.586
This is gonna be dangerous,
so can you tell everyone in town

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:04.714
to please steer clear of
the cliffs for a little while?

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:10.678
[ATOLA] All right,
I borrowed the longest rope

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.513
I could find from
one of the fishermen.

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:14.682
[YUNA] Mm. All we need
now is some bait.

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:16.601
Huh?

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:19.353
[ATOLA screams]

00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:22.315
When you told me you were
gonna use a giant worm as bait,

00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:25.610
I didn't think it would
be the size of a house.

00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:27.653
Lemme guess‐‐
did you beat this, too?

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:31.282
Naturally. Right!
It's time for us to get to work.

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:33.910
Come help me tie
the rope around the worm.

00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:36.871
Okay... I guess so.

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:30.151
[YUNA]
This level of magic

00:18:30.192 --> 00:18:33.070
requires a super
insane amount of mana.

00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:38.826
[YUNA grunting]

00:18:41.412 --> 00:18:43.122
Whoa.

00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:56.927
[gasps]

00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:02.308
[KRAKEN roars]

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:07.605
Wow. It really worked.

00:19:09.106 --> 00:19:11.025
[ATOLA]
You trapped it.

00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:14.028
‐‐[YUNA panting]
‐‐[KUMAKYU, KUMAYURU whine]

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.613
Phase one is complete!

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:18.741
And now it's time
for some kraken hotpot!

00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:28.668
[KRAKEN roars]

00:19:28.709 --> 00:19:30.044
[gasps]

00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:37.968
Man, that was a close call. Uh!

00:19:40.054 --> 00:19:42.098
Well, I guess
regeneration does go along

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:44.558
with the whole
murder squid trope.

00:19:48.062 --> 00:19:51.232
[FIRE BEARS, KUMAYURU, KUMAKYU]
Kuma! Kuma! Kuma! Kuma!

00:19:53.734 --> 00:19:57.279
[YUNA yelling]

00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:02.743
[panting]

00:20:07.331 --> 00:20:08.791
[grunts]

00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:16.132
[YUNA]
There's no escape!

00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:25.891
[panting]

00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:31.397
[KRAKEN roars]

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.192
This is a rough battle.

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:37.027
[YUNA] Maybe I should have
switched to the white bear side

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:38.863
so it could heal me as I fight.

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:42.366
Should I indulge in a quick
change to make things easier?

00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:43.492
No, absolutely not!

00:20:43.534 --> 00:20:46.579
I may be a warrior,
but I also value modesty!

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:50.249
[TOWNSPEOPLE murmuring]

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:52.960
Can anyone see what's happening?

00:20:53.002 --> 00:20:54.336
[DEIGHA]
Let's see...

00:20:54.378 --> 00:20:56.589
Rice! Miso! Soy sauce!
Rice! Miso! Soy sauce!

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:57.506
Rice! Miso! Soy sauce!

00:20:57.548 --> 00:20:59.091
Rice! Miso! Soy sauce!

00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:01.343
The bear girl's fighting it.

00:21:06.015 --> 00:21:11.896
[YUNA panting]

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:15.316
[groans]

00:21:15.357 --> 00:21:17.610
Man, I'm at my limit.

00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:20.821
[KRAKEN roars]

00:21:20.863 --> 00:21:25.534
[YUNA panting]

00:21:25.576 --> 00:21:28.662
[KRAKEN roars]

00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:35.920
Operation squid hotpot is
now officially a success.

00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:38.172
‐‐[ATOLA] Yuna?!
‐‐[KUMAKYU, KUMAYURU gasp]

00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:44.470
[ATOLA]
She's asleep.

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:50.226
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:21:55.773 --> 00:22:00.110
[TOWNSPEOPLE cheer]

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:02.154
We owe that little bear a lot.

00:22:02.196 --> 00:22:06.617
I guess we'll have to feed her
even more delicious food, huh?

00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:10.412
Steamed rice. Miso. Soy sauce.

00:22:10.454 --> 00:22:13.833
Yuna's capable of
accomplishing impossible feats.

00:22:13.874 --> 00:22:15.376
But then when she's sleeping,

00:22:15.417 --> 00:22:18.087
she looks just
like a normal girl.

00:23:52.681 --> 00:23:55.851
[KUMAYURU]
Kuma.
