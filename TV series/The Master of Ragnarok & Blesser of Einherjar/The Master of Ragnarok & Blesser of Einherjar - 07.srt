Well, I certainly won't deny it.

just caught something.

Listen, Yuuto, if you're
going to marry my sister,

I want you to know that
I strongly disapprove

of you having other

Hey, now.

a girl I like waiting back home!

Thank you for your hard
work in the last battle.

24
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,166
Everyone did very well
against the Claw.

25
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,666
I'm proud of you all

and your various accomplishments
on the battlefield.

27
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,125
But I also have to
accept responsibility

28
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,791
for putting you in danger.

29
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,875
It was my failures as a leader
that put you in that place.

30
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,791
So I apologize to you all,

and I hope you
that can forgive me.

[BRUNO] Big Brother, please!
There's no reason to bow to us.

33
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,666
We were only able to defeat
such a powerful enemy

34
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,666
because you were leading
us as patriarch!

00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,291
I don't need your flattery.

But I--

What the Wolf Clan needs
most in this moment

38
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,041
is a new Patriarch,
one who is not only powerful,

00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,541
but knowledgeable,
and has youth on their side.

I already told you that
I'm going back home

as soon as I can!

[FARBAUTI] I'm sorry, but I'm
unable to keep my promise.

You're the only one here
who has the ability

49
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,375
to keep the Wolf
Clan safe, Yuuto.

50
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,791
Wait! Loptr, he should do it!

51
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:11,208
He's way more capable at running
things than I would ever be!

00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,083
Right, Loptr?

53
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,416
[LOPTR grunts]
Cut the act.

54
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,416
[YUUTO]
What act?

55
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,833
Your plan is to
make it look like

56
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,666
you don't want to
become patriarch,

57
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,625
and that you're only agreeing
to assume the role

58
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:23,041
is because
Father insists, right?

59
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,666
What a pitiful little strategy!

60
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,125
That's not it!

61
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,958
I swear I don't want to be
the patriarch, now or ever!

00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:33,041
[LOPTR] Becoming the Wolf Clan's
patriarch was my dream.

00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,375
I did everything in my power.

64
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:37,458
I wanted to protect
Felicia and our people,

65
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,000
to make us a more
powerful nation

66
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,958
that could stand up to
the Claw and Hoof Clans.

67
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,791
I was almost there.

68
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,916
I was so close.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,333

If the day comes that you save

and demanding
to come visit you.

can think about!

Shut up! No, I don't!

You shouldn't lie like that.

you two have stopped by.

Well done as always, Father.

126
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,666
[CHRISTINA]
There's news regarding a tribe

127
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,458
of the Hoof Clan, the Noatun.

128
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,750
They were conquered by a
nomadic Midgardian clan

129
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:10,750
called the Panther.

130
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,000
Wait. A Hoof tribe
was conquered?

131
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,500
And did you say the Panther?

132
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,875
Yes, they came with a mounted
army, thousands strong.

133
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,083
They what?

134
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,625
[CHRISTINA] And they
fired iron-tipped arrows

135
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,750
from horseback. They completely
annihilated the Hoof tribe.

136
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,333
[YUUTO] No! They shouldn't
have that kind of knowledge!

137
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,708
Iron weapons?

138
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,666
I didn't think there were
any clans besides ours

139
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,041
that even knew
how to make those.

140
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,166
That isn't what
worries me the most.

141
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,708
Given Yggdrasil's level of
technological advancement,

142
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,041
cavalry shouldn't be in use

143
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,958
for at least another
few centuries!

144
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,375
Unless someone managed
to get a hold

145
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,208
of our stirrup technology.

146
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,208
No, it can't be.

00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,833
Probably the young
leader of the Wolf Clan

150
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,458
who's no longer here.

151
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,083
I've heard he possesses a rune
which allows him to copy

152
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,208
any kind of technology
he pleases.

153
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,000
[FELICIA] Yes, my brother
is definitely responsible.

154
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,083
Wait. What do you know, Felicia?

155
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,333
I realize now
I should have told you,

156
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,666
but about two weeks ago,

157
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,166
I received an unexpected
message from Loptr.

158
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:12,166
He asked me to turn my
back on the Wolf Clan,

159
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,000
to abandon you and join him.

160
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,208
And also, he said
he's the Patriarch

161
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,666
of the Panther Clan now.

162
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,541
You knew? For this long?

163
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,375
I'm so very sorry.

164
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,791
I'll accept any punishment
that you deem necessary.

165
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,208
But I would never desert you,

166
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,333
and I swear that you're
the only brother I'm loyal to!

167
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:32,791
Easy. It's okay. I'm just
glad that you told me.

168
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,916
Aw, Big Brother.

169
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,833
[YUUTO] Well, it sounds
like he's still harboring

170
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,333
a great deal of
resentment towards me.

171
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,000
[YUUTO] For now, let's send
our congratulations

172
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,750
to the new patriarch
of the Panther Clan

173
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,208
and pretend I know
nothing of his identity.

174
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,500
I should probably reply
to his message too,

175
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,958
to avoid any suspicion.

176
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,833
Yeah. I'm sure you know this,

177
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:58,250
but what you two just heard
stays between us four, Alchris.

178
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,458
We're separate people.

179
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,000
You shouldn't combine
our names like that.

180
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,250
Yes, we understand!

181
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,583
And I'll discipline my sister

182
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,208
if she so much as
breathes a word.

183
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,416
Excuse me?

184
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,416
Good plan.

185
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,166
[ALBERTINA]
What? No, it isn't!

186
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,416
[YUUTO]
Oh, man!

187
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,333
It's definitely not
gonna be an easy task

188
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:20,708
taking down the
Panther Clan's cavalry.

189
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,750
I better make that call
before my battery dies.

190
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:27,250
[phone ringing]

191
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,416
[MITSUKI]
Hello? Yuuto?

192
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,041
[YUUTO]
Hey! What's up?

193
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,625
So what did you do today?

194
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,708
[MITSUKI] Oh, you know,
just a normal day in paradise!

195
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,958
What about you?
Did something happen?

196
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,333
[YUUTO]
Huh?

197
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,708
Because it kinda sounds like
you're forcing yourself

198
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,791
to be cheerful.

199
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,250
[YUUTO] Once again,
you've managed to see

200
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,916
right through my act, Mitsuki.

201
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,708
Come on. I've known you
practically forever,

202
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,875
so there's nothing
you can get past me.

203
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,208
[YUUTO]
True.

204
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,708
Sometimes I think you
know me a little too well.

205
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,208
[MITSUKI]
Sounds rough.

206
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,291
Do you think everything
will be okay?

207
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,875
[YUUTO] Yeah, I'll come
up with something.

208
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,458
[MITSUKI]
That's not what I meant.

209
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:07,041
[MITSUKI] Do you really think
you'll be able to fight Loptr?

210
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,833
I'm the Patriarch of
the Wolf Clan now.

211
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,333
When the time does come,

212
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,083
I'll have no choice
but to fight him,

213
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,083
whether I want to or not.

214
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:25,333
[LOPTR] "The only brother
I'm loyal to is Yuuto." Heh.

215
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,125
I can't believe that
fool had the audacity

216
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:30,083
to forge a letter from
my beloved sister.

217
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,500
Well, it appears the time
has finally come, Yuuto,

218
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:38,291
for you to return what is
rightfully mine, all of it.

219
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,916
[SIGYN chuckles]

220
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,666
[FELICIA]
Big Brother!

221
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,750
[YUUTO] Looks like the
Panther Clan has attacked.

222
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,125
The town of Myrkvithr was taken.

223
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,250
This is bad news.

224
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:55,166
We might actually have to
fight the Panther Clan.

225
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,458
Summon our troops.

226
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,458
We're going to defend
the Horn Clan.

227
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,750
Right.

228
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,416
[YUUTO] We've still got
quite a ways to go

229
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,541
before we get to Myrkvithr.

230
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:17,833
[FELICIA]
Last we heard,

231
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,500
3,000 Panther Clan troops
had gathered there.

232
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,125
So are you absolutely sure

233
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,083
that Christina's
intelligence is correct?

234
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,291
Christina has never
been wrong before.

235
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,041
Though I have to admit
that the thought of facing

236
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:31,416
3,000 cavalrymen is
a sobering one. What's more--

237
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,541
--[SOLDIER A] Watch out!
--[SOLDIER B] It's the enemy!

238
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,916
Attack!

239
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,041
[SOLDIERS shouting]

240
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,041
Crap, they're here!

241
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,875
Units one through three,
move out!

242
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,333
I never expected them

243
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,208
to utilize the exact same
hit-and-run tactics we used

244
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,833
when we fought the Hoof Clan.

245
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,375
Man, it kinda sucks being
on the receiving end of things.

246
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,958
Do you think we should try
and wait until Run can get here?

247
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,541
They sure as hell aren't
going to wait for us.

248
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,125
Get down!

249
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,708
Covering the chariot with
sheet metal just saved us.

250
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,125
Still, though,
it's hard to believe

251
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,125
they were able to target
you from that far away.

252
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,833
Agreed, and I think it's only
fair to return the favor.

253
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,833
Fire!

254
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,833
[SCARFIOR] Unit Two, pass the
next crossbows to Unit One.

255
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,416
Give the unloaded
ones to Unit Three.

256
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,708
They're getting a lot better
at loading the crossbows.

257
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:34,375
Indeed.

258
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,958
Fire!

259
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,625
[grunts]

260
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,833
Retreat, men! Now!

261
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,291
Look, the enemy is withdrawing!

262
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,875
It was just an advance unit.

263
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,166
The real fight will begin when
we meet up with their main army.

264
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,125
[LOPTR]
For all your big talk,

265
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,833
you didn't manage to
accomplish much, Vali.

266
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,625
My information was bad!

267
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,166
They were firing their
crossbows one after the other!

268
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,958
I thought we'd be able
to shoot five times

269
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,416
in the period it took them
to release one volley!

270
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,000
Huh? Do you know
how they managed it?

271
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,916
[VALI] The men in the
first row would fire

272
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,583
while another row of
troops behind them

273
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,166
prepared the next round.

274
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,916
That's how they could
shoot so fast.

275
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,583
I see.

276
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,000
Very well. You may go.

277
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,166
Uh, Sir.

278
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:30,958
Narvi's report stated

279
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,833
that the Wolf Clan currently
has around 8,000 men.

280
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,750
It's amazing that
somebody so young

281
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,833
could have grown
his nation so much.

282
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,416
And he managed to do it
in less than a year.

283
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,916
Please, it's not as if he did
it all with his own power.

284
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,333
The boy himself
isn't anything special.

285
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,458
This time, he'll be the one
who falls into my trap.

286
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,500
[SOLDIERS shouting]

287
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,708
Charge!

288
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,166
We'll slam right
into their ranks!

289
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:58,791
Wait. They're back?

290
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,250
How many of them are there?

291
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,916
Big Brother,
we're completely surrounded!

292
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:11,583
Five thousand of them
at least, maybe more.

293
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,041
[SIGYN] They saw a few soldiers,
let their guard down,

294
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,750
and fell right into our trap.

295
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,333
[LOPTR] They might be able to
fire multiple crossbow shots,

296
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:27,041
but we can easily overwhelm
them with our numbers.

297
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:30,291
Even Yuuto's fancy phalanx
formation is completely useless

298
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,166
when they're surrounded
by an enemy.

299
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,250
That's what happens when
you put too much faith

300
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,375
in your smartphone.

301
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,875
I know exactly what
he's going to do,

302
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,833
and I can counter
anything he throws at us.

303
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,291
Hm?

304
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,541
[LOPTR scoffs] Does he think
he can offer me his cargo

305
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,000
in exchange for his life?

306
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,458
But then again, I suppose
I would expect nothing less

307
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,875
from a coward like Yuuto.

308
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,041
I will crush them down
to the last man!

309
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,375
All units, prepare to attack!

[SOLDIERS shouting]

311
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,625
He made it look like
he surrendered

312
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,000
and then ambushed us?

313

I swear there's no end
to his cowardice!

314

No matter.

Brother, you've learned a
lot since I last saw you.

But you aren't the only
one who's been busy!

324
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,333
You're gonna see that I've
learned a thing or two myself.

are those things?

familiar with my tactics,

he'd try to surround our army
with a huge cavalry force.

So I was waiting for my chance

Yes.

It's surprising, but horses
actually hate camels.
