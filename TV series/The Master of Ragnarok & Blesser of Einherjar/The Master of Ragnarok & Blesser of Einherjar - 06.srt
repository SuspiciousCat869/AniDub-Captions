1
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,916
[YUUTO]
Man, another failure.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,375
You know, I'm starting to think
that making a cup out of glass

3
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:28,750
is just something you made up.

4
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,750
[YUUTO]
It's more like I suck at it.

5
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,958
Do you wanna give
it a try, Ingrid?

6
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,541
[gasps]

7
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:37,208
[YUUTO] Oh, I guess you
wouldn't want my germs, huh?

8
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,041
I'll get you a pipe
I haven't used yet.

9
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:42,166
No, that one's okay, really!
It doesn't bother me at all.

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,916
What I mean is...

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
...I'll just use yours.

12
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,916
[YUUTO]
I'll keep it steady for you.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,250
Just relax and
blow in it slowly.

14
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,458
Uh, okay.

15
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:01,791
[INGRID] I can't relax with
him behind me like that!

16
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:08,958
[INGRID chuckles]

17
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,333
Awesome work!

18
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:12,375
You know, I bet we could
mass-produce these things.

19
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:13,958
Really? You think so?

20
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,166
[YUUTO] You have a
knack for making stuff.

21
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,625
[YUUTO]
I want you to stay by my side.

22
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,083
Don't ever leave me.

23
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,458
Stay by your side?

24
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,083
[YUUTO]
Is something wrong?

25
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:30,375
[INGRID gasps]
No, everything's perfectly fine!

26
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,875
[YUUTO]
Hm?

27
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:35,333
[INGRID] Anyway, why are you
still touching me? Get off!

28
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,250
[FELICIA]
"Valkyrie's Day Off."

29
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,875
Why did you call me here?
Am I in trouble or something?

30
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,416
Not at all.
It's just that I heard

31
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,125
Lord Yuuto has taken quite
a liking to you, young lady.

32
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,375
Because of that,

33
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,458
we thought he might like
to have you around more.

34
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,041
Yes, please don't worry.
If Big Brother likes you,

35
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,291
then it means
we can all be friends

36
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,291
and do lots of
fun things together.

37
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,208
That's right.

38
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,750
Wow. Thank you.
I'm so honored!

39
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,291
Now, the reason I've
called you all here

40
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,958
is because I want to
discuss something important.

41
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,666
It's a matter that
concerns Lord Yuuto.

42
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,791
As you know, Father possesses
a great deal of knowledge,

43
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,833
and his talent for military
tactics is unmatched.

44
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,166
Yet he shows no arrogance

45
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,708
and consistently puts in
more effort than anyone.

46
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,500
I'm sure that everybody
here can agree

47
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,083
that his perseverance,
hard work, and incredible skill

48
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,333
are the driving forces behind

49
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,375
the Wolf Clan's
current prosperity.

50
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,875
I propose we band together

51
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,541
and find a way for
Father to relax,

52
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:04,041
so he has the opportunity
to rest his body and soul.

53
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,750
That makes sense,
and I certainly agree

54
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,083
that Father has more than
earned a little time off,

55
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,083
but I'm not even sure

56
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,125
how we would go
about doing that.

57
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,625
[JORGEN] I was thinking
we could have him take

58
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:16,125
a short vacation in the
foothills of Mt. Surtsey.

59
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,083
[JORGEN] He's been so busy
governing the country,

60
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,291
it seems rather unfair

61
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,750
that he hasn't had any
time to relax in it.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,208
Not to mention, this would
be a great opportunity

63
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,666
to get closer to him.

64
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,708
[ALL giggling]

65
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:42,041
[MITSUKI]
Whoa!

66
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,791
[YUUTO]
Huh? What's wrong, Mitsuki?

67
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:47,125
[gasp] Uh, sorry. I almost
fell out of my chair.

68
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,458
I just had this weird
chill run down my spine.

69
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,333
What a strange feeling!

70
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,208
Think you're getting
sick or something?

71
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,916
Maybe you've caught a cold.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,875
[MITSUKI]
Hm... No.

73
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,416
It wasn't really
that kind of chill.

74
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,166
[FELICIA] And that's why we all
think it would be a good idea

75
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,000
for you to go on a trip
out to the country

76
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,583
and take a little
time for yourself.

77
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,166
Where'd this come from?

78
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,333
It seems a little strange
for me to take a vacation

79
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,291
while everyone else
is working so hard.

80
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,625
Listen, Father, if you do
nothing but work all of the time

81
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,375
then you're going
to make yourself sick.

82
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,583
Precisely.

83
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:19,708
And it's not like
we're telling you

84
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,916
to take a month off or anything.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,791
Okay, I'll go. Just stop
looking at me like that.

86
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,458
That's great!
A group vacation, yay!

87
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,875
Uh, who said that
you were coming?

88
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:38,166
But, sis, I wanna relax too!

89
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,333
Just leave it to us.

90
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,625
We'll make all the
necessary preparations.

91
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,458
[FELICIA giggles]

92
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,583
[EPHERIA chuckles]
Huh?

93
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,916
[EPHERIA yelps]

94
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,208
Listen, Jorgen...

95
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,375
Yes?

96
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,916
I'm going to have to
leave you in charge

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,875
of Iarnvior for a few days.
Do you think you can handle it?

98
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,958
Yes, I can take care of
your responsibilities here,

99
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,333
but it's important
to the Wolf Clan

100
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,416
that you take some
time for yourself.

101
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,000
Why is it so important?

102
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,583
[JORGEN] As long as you
remain in good health

103
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,750
and continue to be
our Patriarch,

104
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,625
the Wolf Clan's prosperity
and fortune will be assured

105
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,791
for many decades to come.

106
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,708
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were trying

107
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,791
to tell me not to
go back to Japan.

108
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,375
[JORGEN chuckles]

109
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,250
[YUUTO]
Still, there's no guarantee

110
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,583
that the Wolf Clan
will stay in power

111
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,666
after I go back home, is there?

112
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,541
[JORGEN] Honestly, you're
overthinking this vacation.

113
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,916
Trust me. It'll be easier to
give in to the girls' request.

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,708
[YUUTO] Yeah. I suppose
it would be nice

115
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,583
to have a few days to
relax and enjoy myself.

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,791
[YUUTO] Nice! I like the
look of this place.

117
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:47,875
[YUUTO sighing]

118
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,500
This is exactly
what I need right now.

119
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,583
[ALBERTINA laughing] Look out,
hot spring, here I come!

120
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:54,750
[CHRISTINA]
Al, wait!

121
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,000
You shouldn't run
when it's so slippery!

122
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,250
[ALBERTINA]
Ha!

123
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,666
Excuse me. This hot
spring is occupied!

124
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,041
What's the big deal?

125
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,958
You know we've been with
you this whole time, right?

126
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,250
Wait. Seriously?

127
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,458
[ALBERTINA giggles]

128
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,833
Look, can you go
somewhere else, please?

129
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,083
I really prefer to
bathe by myself.

130
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,791
[CHRISTINA]
I'm afraid that's not possible.

131
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,708
You need your bodyguards here.

132
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,208
I don't!

133
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,666
Nobody's gonna assassinate me
in the middle of nowhere!

134
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,958
[CHRISTINA] I never said
anything about assassins.

135
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,250
Honestly, I'm more worried

136
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,541
about you being eaten
by a bear or something.

137
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,958
Well, I kinda doubt

138
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,125
you'd be able to stop me
from becoming a bear's lunch.

139
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,666
So, you should go get
Run or somebody.

140
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,291
Okay, fair enough.

141
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,625
Jeez. I'll just have to
sneak out of here quickly

142
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,166
while she's off grabbing Run.

143
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,416
Nice try, but my backup
is actually already on the way.

144
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,875
Huh? They are?

145
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,041
Great.

146
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,583
What?

147
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,458
No way those bears
will get to you now!

148
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,458
I'm starting to think
there are no bears!

149
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,916
[CHRISTINA giggles] Oh, well,
better safe than sorry.

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,583
[YUUTO]
Why are you doing this to me?!

151
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,291
[FELICIA]
It's so peaceful.

152
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,375
It really is like a paradise.

153
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,791
[RUN]
Indeed.

154
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,916
This is the optimal environment
for Father to relax in.

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,666
Yes, there's nothing more
refreshing than a hot spring.

156
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,375
[RUN] Aren't you going
to take your towel off?

157
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,958
Like, in front of other people?

158
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,875
[LINNEA] This is my first time
ever going a hot spring.

159
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,583
I could definitely
get used to this.

160
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:29,958
[sighs]

161
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:34,250
[ALBERTINA laughs]
Look, Mister Monkey, I'm naked!

162
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,333
Whoa!

163
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,833
You'll have to excuse
my older sister.

164
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,125
She still has a lot to learn

165
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,833
when it comes to
acting like a lady.

166
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,041
Uh, since I'm a slave,

167
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,750
should I even be bathing
with everyone else?

168
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,625
Because this kinda
feels inappropriate.

169
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,958
Just take your
towel off already.

170
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,375
No!

171
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,416
I'm starting to think I'll
never have privacy again.

172
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,458
What'cha doing all alone?
Sulking in the corner?

173
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,666
You should come talk with us

174
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,500
instead of standing
over here by yourself.

175
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,416
[YUUTO]
No, thank you!

176
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,250
Don't worry. I actually caught
a quick glimpse of it earlier,

177
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,708
and it's rather impressive.

178
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,708
You know, I think
I'm starting to overheat!

179
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,375
--Bye now.
--[CHRISTINA gasps]

180
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,416
You can't get out already!

181
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,000
I haven't had a chance
to wash your back yet!

182
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,541
Linnea did it last time, so it's
only fair that I get a turn!

183
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,333
She's absolutely right,
Big Brother.

184
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,708
Huh?!

185
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,166
[CHRISTINA chuckles]

186
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,458
[YUUTO sighs]

187
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,208
[YUUTO]
Do what you want.

188
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:31,416
[YUUTO] Hold on a second.
What's going on here?

189
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,500
[FELICIA] After our previous
failure, we all got together

190
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,083
and discussed future
bathing sessions,

191
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,333
which included what would be
the most efficient method

192
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,583
to serve you.

193
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,500
And we drew lots to see
where everybody sits,

194
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:42,958
so it's extra-fair.

195
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:43,833
[sighs]

196
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,041
We're all set.

197
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,916
Whenever you're ready,
we can get started.

198
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,291
[YUUTO] What the heck?
I didn't expect this to happen.

199
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,375
But it's too late for me
to try and back out now.

200
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,375
"A prince should guard himself,
above all things,

201
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,375
against hatred and contempt.
It makes him contemptible

202
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,333
to be considered fickle,
frivolous, and irresolute."

203
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,333
That's what Machiavelli said.

204
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,708
So I have no choice
but to endure!

205
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:11,083
Whatever. I don't care.
Let's get this over with, okay?

206
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,666
But once you guys are done,
I'm definitely leaving.

207
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,291
Right. Then we'll
get started. Excuse me.

208
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,791
[GIRLS]
Here we go!

209
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:18,958
[EPHERIA groans]

210
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,750
[YUUTO yelps]

211
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,791
Felicia, what are you
using to scrub me?

212
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,583
Because it does not
feel like a washcloth.

213
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,166
[FELICIA]
I'm using my breasts, naturally.

214
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,916
[YUUTO]
Why? Just why?

215
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,958
I told you I was thinking
of the best way to serve you.

216
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:37,500
And what better way than
washing you with my own body?

217
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,500
Maybe use a scrub
brush or something.

218
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:43,750
[YUUTO yelps] Whoa, Run!
What did you just do?

219
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,666
I'm seeing to the cleanliness
of your toes by licking them.

220
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,250
[YUUTO]
You're doing what now?!

221
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,958
I didn't hurt you, did I?

222
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,500
No, but I guarantee you
that is not the issue here!

223
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,833
Well, Felicia told me that
I might damage your skin

224
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,416
if I used anything else.

225
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
So we thought the best
course of action would be

226
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,291
for me to use my tongue instead.

227
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:03,333
Are you kidding me, Felicia?
Don't tell her things like that!

228
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,500
[FELICIA giggles]

229
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,458
Those two are only
so close to Big Brother

230
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,958
because they're his advisers.

231
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,833
I won't let that intimidate me!

232
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,250
The same goes for me!

233
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,166
I'm determined to show
Yuuto how grateful I am, too!

234
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,250
Stubbornness is
your super power.

235
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,208
Use it for good, not evil!

236
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,625
[ALBERTINA] Okay!
I wanna clean Father, too!

237
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,125
[CHRISTINA]
Actually, it looks like

238
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,208
we've got everything covered
wash-wise, but if you want,

239
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,000
you can dry him off
with this linen cloth.

240
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,041
[EPHERIA]
I think I'm too young

241
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,250
to be witnessing
this sort of thing.

242
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,208
[ALBERTINA]
Scrubbity, scrub, scrub!

243
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,333
Look at me. I'm helping!

Can't... take... it.

[GIRLS]
We're sorry. Please forgive us.

250
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,250
So, what was the
point of all that?

251
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,250
I've made it abundantly clear
that I prefer to bathe alone.

252
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,458
Yes, but...

253
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,166
It's just that we wanted
to try to repay you

254
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,000
for all the wonderful things
you've done for us

255
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,333
these past two years.

256
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,166
And if you're going to be
leaving us someday,

257
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,916
then we want to do
as much as we can now

258
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,208
in order to help you.

259
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,708
Fine, okay.

260
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,000
Then I'll let you all serve
me for the rest of the trip.

261
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,791
But you have to
wear your clothes!

262
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,750
And no getting too close either!

263
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:20,666
Got it?

264
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,875
[GIRLS]
We understand!

265
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,375
Okay, well now that we've got
your permission to proceed,

266
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,625
how about next we help you relax
with a nice group massage?

267
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,375
Huh?

268
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,666
[LINNEA]
Great idea!

269
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,750
Okay, I don't think you're
grasping the concept

270
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,125
of "not too close."

271
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,791
So let's just go to bed,
and we'll be nice and rested

00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,125
for Al and Chris's
chalice ceremony tomorrow!

273
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,958
But won't you be able to
sleep that much better

274
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,250
if you're nice and
relaxed beforehand?

talk about this first?

Maybe we should do
something else!

280
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,583
We could all tell stories
or braid each other's hair!

Ow. My tummy hurts so much.
I really ate too much this time.

Well, maybe in the future,

287
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,000
you'll learn a
little self-control.

288
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,833
[ALBERTINA grunts] At least
I didn't eat everything.

289

[CHRISTINA]
Good job.

290
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,000
[YUUTO yawns]
We're finally finished!

291
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,125
I've never seen a chalice
ritual get so noisy before.

292
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,208
You performed
your part excellently.

293

[YUUTO]
Linnea!

295
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,416
As your younger sister,
allow me to congratulate you

296
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,291
on adding another two members
to our growing family.

297
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,583
Well, when somebody's done
something impressive,

298
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,458
it's only proper to
reward them for it.

299
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:44,750
I think that's the key

300
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,958
in getting talented people
to join your cause.

301
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:50,041
Oh, by the way, did you hear?
I mean, about Steinthor.

302
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,458
Yeah, I heard.

303
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,541
I still can't believe that
idiot survived the river.

304
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,958
But there's no reason to worry,

305
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,291
because it's not like he
could ever beat you in battle.

306
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,041
I'm not anything special myself.

307
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,791
I'm simply lucky to be
surrounded by amazing people.

308
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,583
I owe everything to you guys.

309
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:04,250
Right?

310
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,458
[RUN gasps]
Huh?

311
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,416
Um, yeah, sure.

312
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,083
I guess.

313
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,000
[INGRID]
Here you go.

314
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:18,041
Personally, I think it's
even better than before.

315
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,000
[STEIN]
You'll never defeat me!

316
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,666
[gasps]

317
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,958
[sighs]

318
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,583
Hey, now, I'll have you know

319
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,125
that sword happens to be
one of my finest creations.

320
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,291
Do you have some kind of
problem with it or something?

321
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,125
No, it's great.
I'm very satisfied with it.

322
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,333
It's a beautiful piece.
Thank you, Ingrid.

323
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,458
[INGRID] Yeah, well,
you don't look very satisfied.

324
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,875
Uh, I am.

325
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:51,000
It's just that you made
this katana, right?

326
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,166
Yeah, why do you ask?

327
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,208
Are you lookin' for a fight?
Because I will give you one!

328
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,666
I didn't mean to insult you--

329
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,458
I don't care whether
you meant to or not.

330
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:03,250
Now you had better tell me what
the deal was with that sigh!

331
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,500
And you'd better give
me a good answer,

332
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,375
or I'll never make
you a weapon again!

333
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,041
Don't even joke about that!

334
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,250
[INGRID] Then I suggest
you start explaining!

335
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,375
What exactly did the sigh mean?

336
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:18,166
Fine, I'll tell you.
Here goes.

337
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,166
See, the thing is,

338
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,000
I was thinking about
how it wasn't Father

339
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,458
who made this
sword for me, so...

340
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:25,375
So?

341
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,833
What I'm trying to say is

342
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:30,041
that I wanted Father to make
the katana for me instead.

343
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,375
[RUN] When I think
about losing the weapon

344
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,291
that Father came up with,

345
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,708
I feel like I've also lost

346
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,208
the sense of safety and
joy that it brought me.

347
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,750
It's just gone.

348
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:42,958
To be perfectly honest,

349
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,625
I'm almost afraid
to fight without it

350
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:48,125
because it makes me
feel less sure of myself.

351
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,500
I see.

352
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,916
Hello there, Ingrid.

353
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,208
I wanted to ask if I could get
your help with something.

354
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,125
Hello, Father.

355
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,083
I'm glad you're here too, Run.
Perfect timing.

356
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,416
You'll never believe what I got

357
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,958
from a merchant who came
to the chalice ritual.

358
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,625
[gasps]

359
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,291
Careful! Otherwise,
you might cut yourself!

360
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,500
The hilt.

361
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,083
Yeah, I'm afraid the
hilt was a lost cause,

362
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,791
but the blade seems
to be intact.

363
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:18,166
I'm sure Ingrid can
fix it for you.

364
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm just so glad to
finally have it back.

365
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,458
I don't think she heard me.

366
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,166
I don't think so, either.

367
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,875
[FELICIA laughs] She's happy,
and that's what matters.

368
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,208
[INGRID] Well, it looks like
I have more work to do.

369
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,208
By the way, Yuuto, how's the
whole glass thing going?

370
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,541
Pretty well, I think!

371
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,291
Let's go to the bazaar
and take a look.

372
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,291
It's always best to see
things with your own eyes.

373
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,750
Wow, the market's even
more crowded than usual.

374
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,250
Iarnvior is the only place

375
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,208
where you can buy
blown glass, after all.

376
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,750
So, I guess, in the end,
all that work was worth it.

377
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,000
Even though a certain someone

378
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,458
was making it hard
to concentrate.

379
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,583
[YUUTO]
Hm. I know it wasn't easy,

380
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,041
but we're making a fortune now.

381
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,291
And all thanks to
your wisdom, Big Brother.

382
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,416
Now the Wolf Clan will be even
more prosperous than before.

383
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,583
The poverty we experienced
two years ago

384
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,333
feels like ancient history.

385
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,833
[YUUTO]
That's good and all,

386
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,625
but we don't have the
resources we need

387
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,958
to do anything with that wealth.

388
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,041
There aren't enough talented
people to do the jobs

389
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,833
that will help the Wolf Clan
continue to grow.

390
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,000
Here, Master, I brought
you something to drink.

391
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,666
Great. Thank you!

392
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,875
[EPHERIA yelps]

393
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,041
[YUUTO groans]

394
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,833
[EPHERIA gasps]
Oops! I'm so sorry!

395
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,791
Oh, no! What have I done?
I don't know why I'm so clumsy!

396
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:42,416
Please forgive me, Master.
I'll do anything!

397
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,083
Relax. I'm not going to get
angry over a little water.

398
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,083
But I...

399
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,166
[ALL giggling]

400
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,666
I'm sure you're still getting
used to your new life here.

401
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,458
But thanks for
everything you do.

402
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,375
Uh, no. There's nothing
to thank me for.

403
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,708
I'm not as helpful
as the others.

404
00:17:58,791 --> 00:17:59,625
You sure?

405
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:00,875
Uh-huh.

406
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,583
I may have lost my friends
and my big house,

407
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,541
but in the end,
you saved me and my mother,

408
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,083
so I want to do more
to repay your kindness.

409
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,541
I'm just not good
at anything yet.

410
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,958
Please don't worry about
repaying me, Epheria.

411
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,166
Now come on, we have
some yummy dessert here.

412
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,666
Oh, no! I could never!

413
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,000
There's no way
that I'm worthy enough

414
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,083
to eat the same dessert
as you, Master!

415
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,375
Well, that's a problem.

416
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,708
See, I'm actually not
a big fan of sweets,

417
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,375
but it would be rude to
the person who made it

418
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,000
to let it go uneaten.

419
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,083
It sure would help me out

420
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,958
if someone would
finish it for me.

421
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,083
I really shouldn't do that.
It isn't proper.

422
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,916
Go on. Eat it before it
goes stale. It's tasty.

423
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,833
[EPHERIA gasps] Okay.
Thank you. You're so kind.

424
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,000
Oh, wow!
It really is tasty!

425
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,000
What's this?

426
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,958
It's so delicious
it made you cry?

427
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:50,166
Yes, but the taste isn't
the only reason.

428
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,416
It just reminded me

429
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,750
of when I used to eat
these sorts of things

430
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,208
with my mom and dad,
back before I was a slave.

431
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:58,375
It sounds like you've
had a rough time, too.

432
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,791
Never mind.

433
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,958
I'm sorry if I made you
remember something unpleasant.

434
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,166
It's fine!

435
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,833
Thank you again for
the delicious dessert!

436
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,125
You're welcome.

437
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,125
Hold on a second.

438
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,125
Hey, Effy, come here.

439
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,791
Can you read that
sign across the way?

440
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,708
[EPHERIA]
At the wool merchant's stall?

441
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:22,125
It says, "One byg of silver
for 360 byg of wool."

442
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,875
Okay, that's plenty.

443
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,541
Now, you can have as
much of this as you like.

444
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,958
[EPHERIA gasps]
There's so much.

445
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,708
I couldn't possibly
take all this!

446
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,166
Of course you can.

447
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,416
Besides, I owe you for
the idea you just gave me.

448
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,583
[FELICIA]
Compulsory education?

449
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,041
Yeah, that's right.

450
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,958
Did you see how Effy could
read the sign at the market?

451
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,458
I did.

452
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,916
It she seems as though she
and her mom were quite well off

453
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,375
prior to becoming slaves.

454
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,833
Agreed. It gave me an idea.

455
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,000
You see, with a
proper education,

456
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,625
even small children like
Effy can learn to read.

457
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,458
Sorry, Yuuto.
I'm not following.

458
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,666
To put it bluntly,

459
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,375
the clan's literacy rate
is disastrously low.

460
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,041
And if we don't
address that problem,

461
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:06,666
we'll always have a
limited talent pool.

462
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,291
--Right.
--Okay?

463
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,875
What I'm saying is, I think
we should see to it

464
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,541
that every child from
the ages of 7 to 15

465
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:17,041
is given at least
a basic education.

466
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,666
But tuition would be expensive

467
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,958
and difficult for many
parents to afford.

468
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,625
And I feel like it
would be a little cruel

469
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,750
to force them to pay for
it against their will.

470
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,666
You don't have to
worry about that.

471
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,125
We'll make it so they can
attend school for free.

472
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,291
What?

473
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,916
The Wolf Clan can cover
all the expenses,

474
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,708
the teachers, the supplies,
the buildings.

475
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,333
Whatever it is they need
in order to be successful.

476
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,666
[GIRLS gasp]

477
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,291
We're making a ton of money
from our glassware.

478
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,666
It won't be long
before it exceeds

479
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,125
what we've ever made
from selling paper.

480
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,916
"No principality is secure
without having its own forces.

481
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,666
On the contrary, it's dependent
on good fortune,

482
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,250
not having the valor
which would defend it.

483
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,291
It has always been the
judgment of wise men

484
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,791
that nothing can
be so uncertain

485
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,458
as fame or power not founded
on its own strength."

486
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:03,333
Got it?

487
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,833
The only thing I got from that

488
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,541
is that you're about
to do something crazy.

489
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:10,083
It may seem like very
little to start with.

490
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,333
But if we start the process now,
in five or ten years' time,

491
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,791
it will reap a great benefit

492
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,875
for the Wolf Clan
and its people.

493
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,000
I see now.

494
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,666
If we don't have enough
talented people,

495
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,041
then we just have to start
developing our own.

496
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,583
That's exactly right.

497
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,208
[FELICIA] It sounds like
Brother's trying to plan

498
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,166
for what will happen
after he leaves us.

499
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,583
[INGRID]
It's a good idea.

500
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,041
Especially when you consider

501
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,875
how bad you used to be at
reading compared to Epheria.

502
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,291
Yeah. Hopefully,
the children of the Wolf Clan

503
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,916
catch on faster than I did.

504
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,291
[INGRID]
I bet they will.

505
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,833
[YUUTO]
Be nice.

506
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,541
I've learned a lot in the two
years since I've come here.

507
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,458
[LOPTR]
Glad to have you aboard, Yuuto.

508
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,208
The hot spring was so fun!

509
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,958
I think hectic and noisy
is more like it.

510
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,083
You'd be less grouchy

511
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,416
if you'd actually
done some swimming.

512
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,958
Swimming isn't the point
of going to a hot spring,

513
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:40,791
you dummy!

514
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:41,625
Then what do you do in them?

515
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:42,875
Soak in the water and relax.

516
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:45,000
Okay, we should go back
and try it right now!

517
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,000
We can't go all
the time, you know!
