but you always looked so upset,
like you hated the idea.

00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,916
And all the girls around
you are so beautiful.

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,375
I can't compare to them.

162
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,333
It was silly.

163
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,750
I don't know why I thought
you'd ever want a girl like me.

164
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,916
I promise you, you're more
than beautiful enough

165
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,750
for any man to want you.

166
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,208
Then why don't you?

167
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,666
Because, well, I'm the
leader of the Wolf Clan,

168
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,416
which means that I
have responsibilities.

169
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,083
Actually, that's not true.

Hey, what are you doing?

Much better.

I had to drive all of
that pretentious crap

173
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,916
out of my head somehow.

Linnea, I'm sorry!

175
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,333
I should have told
you right away.

I can't marry you!

Okay, well, will you at least
give me an explanation?

178

I'm in love with someone,

and I'm trying to
remain faithful to her.

180
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,958
If that's all you're
worried about,

181
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,291
then why not marry both of us?
I think I could accept that.

182

Well, things don't
exactly work that way

[YUUTO] If you'll be patient,
I'll tell you everything.

186

This is going to
sound unbelievable,

187
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:44,416
but the thing is, I'm not
originally from here.

188
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,750
I'm actually from
a different time,

in the future.

[LINNEA gasps]

191
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,708
That's why I know so many things

192
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,583
that seem incredibly advanced
to the people here.

193
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,000
[LINNEA]
You're right.

194
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:01,083
That isn't the kind of story
that's easy to believe.

195
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,333
But as ridiculous
as it might sound,

196
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,750
it also explains
a lot about you.

197
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,583
I mean, all those
inventions of yours.

198
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,083
If you came from the future,

199
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,666
then that must be where
you got the ideas from.

200
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,041
Yeah, I'm glad you're
so quick on the uptake.

201
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,541
But the point I'm
trying to get at is

202
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,041
that I'm gonna have
to go back home someday.

203
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,666
Because the girl that
you're in love with

204
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,875
is waiting for you back there?

205
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,458
As long as she's waiting for me,

206
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,375
I'll always try to reach her,
and I won't be with anyone else.

207
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,250
It makes me jealous to hear that
there's somebody you love enough

208
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,416
that you would stay
loyal to them for so long.

209
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,333
I guess she must be
a really incredible woman.

210
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:43,500
Yeah, well, she's actually
kind of a loudmouth and a crier.

211
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,833
And I recently learned
that she's pretty dang scary

212
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,291
when she's pissed off.

213
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,833
So she's basically a mess,
but she's my mess.

214
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,500
And 'cause of that,

215
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,250
I really need to go
and be there for her.

[LINNEA]
But we need you, too.

If you suddenly disappeared,

218
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,125
the Horn Clan wouldn't
have anyone to rely on.

219
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,916
I don't think that's true.
They'll still have you.

220
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,583
Frankly, I was amazed when I saw

221
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,208
how quickly you won
over those farmers.

222
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm just a phony
who's been leeching

off her father's legacy.

224
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,375
I'm such a fool.

00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,083
All in a twisted effort
to prove myself,

226
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,208
I started a reckless war
against your clan and lost,

harm to my people.

[YUUTO]
Once upon a time,

234
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:43,750
there was a kid who
was a serious brat.

235
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,958
He had more knowledge
than anyone...

236
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,375
In this time at least.

237
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:52,041
People were always saying
how great he was.

238
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,833
But he'd taken that
knowledge from others.

239
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,083
He didn't deserve the credit

240
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:59,041
for even one of
his achievements.

241
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,250
Despite that, he got a big head.

242
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,250
He thought that because
of that knowledge,

243
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,333
he knew more about anything
than just about anyone.

244
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,083
He chalked up warnings
to mere jealousy.

245
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,583
Then made a huge mistake.

246
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:17,958
Because of that,
someone close to him died.

247
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,416
It should've been the brat
who paid for that mistake,

248
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,458
but someone gave their
life to protect him.

249
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,625
He was a lot like
you after that,

250
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:29,333
paralyzed by his newly
discovered limitations.

251
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:33,416
He blamed himself,
just like you do.

252
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,000
But all that matters
is what you do next.

253

"Steel is tempered 100 times."

254
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,333
It's an old saying from
my home country.

255
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:47,541
You have to temper your mind
and body over and over.

256
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,625
That's the only real way to get
stronger that I've heard of.

257
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,916
Let me ask you this.

258
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,291
Why should you let one
mistake break you forever?

259
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,666
I mean you've barely even
gotten started, right?

260
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,583
This is your chance
to temper yourself,

261
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,791
to start growing stronger!

262
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:09,375
Do you really think that someone
like me could become strong?

If it'll make me
the kind of leader

I want to do it!

my mind that you can.

more talent than me.

00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,625
[ALBERTINA screams]

315
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,541
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

316
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,208
[CHRISTINA]
Well, she's rather weak,

317
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,458
which means she's poorly suited
for fighting on a battlefield.

318
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,666
But if used as an
escort or assassin,

319
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,916
my sister should prove
to be quite valuable.

320
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,041
Nobody would ever suspect
she was an assassin

321
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,333
until it was already too late.

322
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,791
No kidding! It never occurred
to me. That's crazy.

323
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,333
I feel lucky my head's
still attached to my neck.

324
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:59,000
Don't worry. There's no way
we would have assassinated you.

325
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,583
Wait. "Would have"?

326
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:04,083
We had a golden opportunity,
and I was pretty insulted

327
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,458
when you suggested our patriarch
wanted to get rid of us.

328
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,166
Remember?

329
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,958
So what you're trying to say
is you two have the ability

330
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:14,000
to easily sneak into the enemy's
city and take out their guards?

331
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:17,041
Perhaps it's time for you
ladies to take a little trip.

332
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,583
We can do that for you.

333
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,000
In return, I want your word that
we can make an oath with you

334
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,041
when it's all said and done.

335
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,916
Yeah, an Oath!

336
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,041
--[YUUTO] This is it, huh?
--[FELICIA] Yes,

337
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,083
the Elivagar River
is what marks our border

338
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,958
with the Lightning
Clan's territory.

339
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,041
Steinthor's strength
and stupidity remind me

340
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,083
of a warrior named Xiang Yu.

341
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,958
Our best plan might be
to cross the river

342
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,750
and fight him over there.

343
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,958
Hey, we could try that
trick Han Xin used.

344
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,375
I don't follow you.

345
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,166
Han Xin was a great warrior.

346
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,083
Listen, Linnea,
I need your help,

347
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,875
and it's something
only you can do.

348
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,708
You want my help?
Are you sure?

349
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,083
[YUUTO]
Yes, I'm positive.

350
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,875
You're the only person
who can do this task, okay?

351
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,583
Right!

352
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,083
[MITSUKI on phone]
It's so good to hear your voice!

353
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,500
[YUUTO]
Thanks. You too.

354
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,125
[MITSUKI]
You sound kinda down.

355
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,583
Is everything okay?

356
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,708
[YUUTO] Well, it looks like
we're headed to war again.

357
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,208
[MITSUKI gasps]
Why?

358
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,375
I thought you said
things would be peaceful.

359
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,708
[YUUTO]
I know. I thought they were.

360
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,000
But then this jackass showed up.

361
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,625
He's gonna attack us,
so we have to fight.

362
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,208
[MITSUKI] I see. I guess
jerks exist everywhere.

363
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:32,000
[YUUTO]
Totally. You can say that again.

364
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:35,291
[MITSUKI] Just make sure you
survive and come back, okay?

365
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,416
I will. I promise.

366
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,333
[YUUTO]
So Steinthor.

367
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,625
Why would he wanna
go to war with us?

368
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,583
[FELICIA]
Maybe he's after land?

369
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,916
Gimle does have a lot
of fertile fields.

370
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,458
And they're pretty
close to the border.

371
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,416
[JORGEN] It could be because
the Lightning and Hoof Clans

372
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,541
are allies. In fact, Yngvi,
the Hoof Clan Patriarch,

373
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,416
was Steinthor's father-in-law.

374
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,291
So, perhaps he wants revenge?

375
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,041
He doesn't strike me as the type
of person who's into vengeance.

376
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,583
We've already begun our
preparations for battle.

377
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,541
About how much time
do you think we have?

378
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,166
At this point, I don't
really know for sure.

379
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,708
But fortunately for us,
once their army starts to move,

380
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,458
Christina will let us
know via carrier pigeon.

381
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:19,083
I've heard that the Lightning
Clan has never lost a battle

382
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,708
since Steinthor
became patriarch.

383
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,208
Is their army really
that strong?

384
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,958
Their army has
a normal formation.

385
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,291
And to my knowledge,

386
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,083
they don't have any
special weapons or cavalry.

387
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,000
They never set any traps
and always use the same tactic,

388
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,750
charging straight forward.

389
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,333
In that case, how do they
always manage to win?

390
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:40,083
Well, their soldiers' morale
is extremely high.

391
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,666
Okay and...?

392
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,875
The reason they always win is
because of Steinthor himself.

393
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,791
What makes that jerk so special?

394
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,916
Basically, the young
twin-runed Einherjar stands

395
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,875
out in front of his army
like a one-man vanguard.

396
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:55,041
He crushes his opponent's
armies without hesitation,

397
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:58,041
and it inspires his men
to charge into battle after him.

398
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:01,125
[YUUTO] We're lucky to have
Einherjar like Run on our side.

399
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,791
And beyond her,
we have Scarfior,

400
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:07,125
the former Managarmr, as well
as many other gifted warriors.

401
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:10,875
Still though, we're not going to
win a war with just them alone.

402
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,416
[RUN] You're absolutely right.
I'm sorry.

403
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,833
If only I possessed the
same twin-runed power

404
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,791
that Steinthor does in battle...

405
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,625
Don't apologize. None of
us can do what he does.

406
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,000
And what does he do?

407
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,666
Well, a good example is what
happened seven years ago

408
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,791
back when the Lightning Clan
was fighting their neighbors,

409
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:28,958
the Snake Clan.

410
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,916
When he was only 13 years old.

411
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,125
Years before he
became a patriarch,

412
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,833
Steinthor single-handedly
took down an entire fort

413
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,625
garrisoned by several
hundred men.

414
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,250
How'd he do that?

415
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,750
By charging straight at it.

416
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,625
No way! Are you serious?

417
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,041
[SCARFIOR] He broke down
the gate with sheer force.

418
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,625
And out of the hundreds
of guards there,

419
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,083
he killed most of
them singlehandedly.

420
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,875
What a show off!

421
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,375
[FELICIA] In their war with the
Hoof Clan three years ago,

422
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,875
he fell for a trap
that was laid by Yngvi.

423
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,875
They had the Lightning Clan
completely surrounded.

424
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,375
But then Steinthor
used his power

425
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,375
to break through the
encirclement alone.

426
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,708
After that, the Hoof Clan
didn't stand a chance.

427
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,375
That's crazy.

428
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,916
You have to understand.

429
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,541
Steinthor's exploits go beyond
that of a simple Einherjar.

430
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,291
I don't care. He's an idiot.

431
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,333
What?

432
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,875
Don't you get it?

433
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,708
It's just the bravery of a fool!

434
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:22,625
Charging into everything
head first isn't bravery!

435
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,708
Screw that guy!

436
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:28,333
The Wolf Clan will not
be beaten by a moron!

437
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:41,916
[STEIN] So our army is
8,000 strong in all, huh?

438
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,708
That's more than the Wolf Clan
could possibly muster.

439
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,458
Everyone, get ready to march!

440
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:53,500
[SOLDIERS cheering]

441
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:33,708
So, Lady Linnea,

442
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:35,750
tell me why you were in
Lord Yuuto's room earlier.

443
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,208
I just needed to talk to him!

444
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,416
Is that what you call it?

445
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,875
Well, what else would
you call sleeping--

446
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:42,916
Oh, so scandalous!

447
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,833
You're as fun to
tease as my sister.

448
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:47,000
Just shut up and do the preview!
