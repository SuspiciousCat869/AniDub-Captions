And good morning!

00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:44,458
Let me guess, were you training?

8
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,333
[RUN] Yes, but what
about you, Felicia?

9
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,250
You're up early.

10
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,541
[FELICIA]
That I am!

11
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,416
I was just preparing
breakfast for Big Brother!

Wow, nice reflexes!

--[RUN] Hmm.
--[FELICIA] Huh?

16
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,750
[RUN] How do you get them
to look so perky all the time?

17
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:03,750
Oh, these? Do I sense a
small hint of jealousy?

18
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:04,958
Not really.

19
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,958
Honestly, I think they'd
just get in the way.

20
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,166
Then why do you care
about their perkiness?

21
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,083
I was curious, but they'd be
troublesome for a warrior.

22
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:13,666
That may be true for you,

23
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,000
but I bet Big Brother prefers
his melons to be big, so there!

24
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,791
Something wrong?

25
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:23,125
[FELICIA] No, though it does
make me a bit curious.

26
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,416
I wonder what kind of women

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,208
Big Brother is used to
back in his own world.

Stop! I'm serious!

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,583
Whoa, rude!

34
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,333
Fine!

35
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:17,958
You're such a killjoy.

36
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,541
Know what, I bet
they're only that huge

37
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,791
because of how
much you eat, huh?

38
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,583
And on that note,
sharing is caring!

Your cooking skills
are out of this world!

43
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,541
Yeah? Do you really think so?

44
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,625
[RURI]
Mm-hmm.

45
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,625
You can tell when
a girl is in love.

46
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,541
You must seriously wanna
impress that Yuuto guy.

47
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,875
Hey. I asked you
not to bring him up

48
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,833
when we're at school,
remember, Ruri?

49
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,708
It's not my fault he'd
just leave a nice girl

50
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,000
like you all alone.

51
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,375
He needs to hurry up
and get back here.

52
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,750
Don't be so hard on him.

53
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,125
I know that Yuuto
is trying his best!

54
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,750
At least, I'm pretty
sure he is, anyway.

55
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,291
Uh, yeah, no.

56
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,875
Come on, you're the one
who said he's got

57
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,500
a sweet little harem over there.

58
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,666
Well, it's going to take more
than some stupid harem

59
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,041
to keep him from
coming home, okay?

60
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,666
Calm down, it's not like
you guys are dating.

61
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,875
Yeah, but we probably
will when he gets back!

62
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,958
Um, y'know, maybe.

63
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,375
Seriously?

64
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,416
Some things never change.

65
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,583
Looks like we'll
both be spending

66
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,500
the New Year
boyfriend-less, as usual.

67
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,166
Hey, wait a sec!

68
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,375
Mitsuki, you should totally
come hang out at my place

69
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,458
on New Year's Eve!

70
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,833
Uh, what for?

71
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,208
Remember my cousin Saya
who's been living abroad?

72
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,458
She's gonna be back in town,

73
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,250
so you'll finally get
a chance to meet her!

74
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,708
Oh, yeah?

75
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:39,875
[gasps]

76
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,208
That gives me an idea!

77
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,583
Since Saya's spent all
this time studying abroad,

78
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,000
she probably knows
all kinds of stuff, right?

79
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,625
Okay, so what?

80
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,416
Do you think she knows
anything about archaeology?

81
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,791
Well, yeah. I think she
might have actually gotten

82
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,000
a doctorate's degree in it.

83
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,708
[MITSUKI] I'd really like the
chance to talk to her, then.

84
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,875
She might know something
about Yuuto's world!

85
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,916
[RURI]
Come on in, Mitsuki!

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,375
[SAYA] Good evening,
it's nice to meet you.

87
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,583
I'm Saya Takao.

88
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,250
Uh, it's nice
to meet you, too!

89
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,000
My name's Mitsuki Shimoya.

90
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,875
Thank you both for
having me over.

91
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,333
Our pleasure!

92
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,041
Ruri says you have
an interesting story

93
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,458
about your childhood friend
being zapped into the past?

94
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,750
It sounds like cool stuff.

95
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,000
You calling it a "story"

96
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,041
makes it seem like
I'm not telling the truth.

97
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:36,041
That's not what I'm saying,
so don't jump to conclusions.

98
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,333
Does that mean you
believe me, Saya?

99
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:41,041
Well, I'm not exactly saying
that I do believe you,

100
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,083
but I need a few more details
before I can know for sure.

101
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,291
Why don't you tell me the whole
story from the very beginning,

102
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,000
and we'll go from there.

103
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,250
Once I have all the facts

104
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,708
I'll be able to make a
more informed decision.

105
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,791
So, does that sound fair?

106
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,541
It's pretty cold outside.

107
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,083
Why not come sit at the kotatsu?

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,375
[sighs]

109
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,916
[RURI]
Mmm.

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,708
[SAYA] Okay, so you're
saying Yggdrasil is a world

111
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,250
in the Bronze Age? Hmm.

112
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,666
It seems a little too detailed

113
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,500
to be something a middle
schooler would make up.

114
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,041
‘Cause it's true!

115
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,000
I swear I wouldn't waste your
time like this if it wasn't!

116
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,583
[SAYA chuckles]

117
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,250
Relax, what I'm trying to say
is that I believe your story.

118
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,416
[gasps]

119
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,375
Wow, thank you for
listening to me!

120
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,416
This is pretty great news, huh?

121
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Well, don't celebrate just yet.

122
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,125
Unfortunately, I still
don't have a clue

123
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,541
where your friend
actually is, Mitsuki,

124
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,458
or what time period
he may be trapped in.

125
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,750
Oh, that's too bad.

126
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:42,375
In your account, you used a lot
of terms from Norse mythology.

127
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:45,083
However, I noticed there are
also quite a few variations

128
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,333
from the things I learned
about during my studies.

129
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,833
Yuuto actually mentioned
something similar.

130
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:53,000
He said that's why all the
research he did wasn't helpful.

131
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,708
Ah, but there are
some parallels there

132
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,500
that I find
rather interesting.

133
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,625
What, do you mean,
like similarities?

134
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,041
Exactly.

135
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,791
For example, there's your
friend's title.

136
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,000
When you were talking earlier,
I believe you said

137
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,833
it was "Hrthvitnir,
the Infamous Wolf," right?

138
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,000
Uh-huh, but why does it matter?

139
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:14,041
Because, it's another
name for Fenrir.

140
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,041
[gasps]

141
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,916
[SAYA] And then there's
the guy who's the Patriarch

142
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,125
of the Lightning Clan.

143
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,083
You said that he
possessed Megingjörth,

144
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,166
the Belt of Strength,

145
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,166
and Mjölnir
the Shatterer, right?

146
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,833
So he's obviously associated
with Thor somehow.

147
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,416
What's more, there's also
the thing you mentioned

148
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,166
where your friend defeated him
using the Wei River Stratagem.

149
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,750
[MITSUKI]
Yes, that's right.

150
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,458
[SAYA] The name of the river
in your story was Jormungandr,

151
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,041
and there's a myth about that.

152
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,916
It's a massive snake
with the same name

153
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
that fought Thor three times.

154
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,958
The Younger Edda says
that during Ragnarok,

155
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,833
it swept away the
land with a flood.

156
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,041
[MITSUKI yelps]

157
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,125
Whoa, there sure are
a lot of coincidences.

158
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,875
Let's see. What else?

159
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,333
Oh yeah, and about
your friend's name.

160
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,791
Humor me a sec.

161
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,833
Does his name include
the syllables "su"

162
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,125
and "to" by chance?

163
00:07:59,208 --> 00:07:59,833
Uh-huh.

164
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,208
His name is Yuuto Suou,

165
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,166
so both those
sounds are in there.

166
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,750
But how on Earth
could you know that?

167
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,041
Well, it's partly due to
Fenrir and Jörmungandr

168
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,000
being involved in Ragnarok.

169
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,416
I'm just connecting all the dots

170
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,416
because of the
other similarities.

171
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,083
Meaning?

172
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,750
Now back to your friend.

173
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,500
He's Japanese,
so unless he happens

174
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,000
to be biracial the
same way I am,

175
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,625
he's probably got black hair
and dark eyes, right?

176
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,083
Uh, yeah, does it matter?

177
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,083
[SAYA chuckles]
You see, it all comes back

178
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,875
to the tales of Ragnarok.

179
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,291
There's a myth about a giant.

180
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,625
In the stories, he's referred
to as "The Dark One."

181
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,416
So what does the
giant do in the story?

182
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,125
He's responsible for leading
the Múspell on horseback

183
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,458
across the rainbow
bridge of Bifröst,

184
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,791
where they ultimately
attack Asgard.

185
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,166
He's known as the flame giant

186
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,458
who ends up destroying
all the nine worlds.

187
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,041
[gasps]

188
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,875
His name is Surtr.

189
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,500
What I'm wondering
is if your friend's name,

190
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,875
"Yuuto Suou" is somehow
related to "Surtr."

191
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,166
Of course, there's also
your name, Shimoya.

192
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,250
It's kind of similar to
Surtr's wife, which is Sinmara.

193
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,166
[MITSUKI sighs]
Yeah.

194
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,416
Hey Mitsuki, are you okay?

195
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,208
Yeah! I'm fine. There's just
a lot of information,

196
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,208
and it's kind of overwhelming
trying to understand it all.

197
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,708
So in Yggdrasil,

198
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,625
Yuuto is somehow following
the stories in Norse mythology,

199
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,083
is that what you're saying?

200
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,166
Um, I don't think
it's that exactly.

201
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,916
It's more like he's forging
the original Norse myth,

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,500
if that makes any sense.

203
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,916
How can that be?

204
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Look, this might be a
total shot in the dark,

205
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,500
but from what I've studied,

206
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,833
Norse mythology is believed
to have originated somewhere

207
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:38,041
in between 1000 BCE
and the birth of Christ.

208
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,208
Will you tell me again

209
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,291
what time period you
thought he was in?

210
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,583
Well, we don't know
for sure, really.

211
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,500
But, we think it's 1500 BCE.

212
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,833
But that's a long time before
any of those myths began.

213
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,791
[gasps]

214
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,333
Whoa, Mitsuki.

215
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,041
Try to calm down,
what's the matter?

216
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,583
I remembered at the
end of that myth,

217
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,708
something terrible happens
to Fenrir and Jörmungandr.

218
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,708
They both end up dying!

219
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,541
If he's creating all
these Norse myths,

220
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,541
then that means Yuuto
is going to die, too!

221
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,875
We have to do
something to save him!

222
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,625
We don't know if that's true.

223
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,833
[MITSUKI]
Still though. What if it is?

224
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,583
Yuuto...

225
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,125
But Mitsuki,
don't you remember

226
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,041
what we talked about earlier?

227
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,333
We know that even though
there are similarities,

228
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,625
the myths aren't the same.

229
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,041
[MITSUKI gasps]

230
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,833
The odds of him following
that path are pretty low.

231
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,333
Yeah. I guess you're right.

232
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,958
It's not like there's any
way to know for sure

233
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,958
that Yuuto is going to die.

234
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,416
It's just a story,
so he'll be okay.

235
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,041
It's only a story...

236
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,833
It's only a story.

237
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,500
[SAYA]
I'm sorry. I wanted to help you,

238
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:55,125
but I feel like I've given you
more to worry about than before.

239
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,583
[MITSUKI]
It's fine.

240
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,000
Here's the thing.

241
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,416
Norse mythology was primarily
more an oral tradition,

242
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,875
so things aren't set in stone.

243
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,083
Nobody knows for certain

244
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,791
which parts have been
recorded accurately,

245
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,083
and which fragments
might have been left out.

246
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,333
What I'm saying here is that
you should try to stay positive.

247
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,541
Right, I'll keep that
in mind, thank you.

248
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,541
Before you go, there is another
fact regarding Ragnarok

249
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,041
that I think
you'll find useful.

250
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,875
When it happens, all bonds,
chains and seals are broken,

251
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,166
and everyone who was
imprisoned is released.

252
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,666
If that's true, then maybe it
means he'll come home.

253
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,375
Right.

254
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:35,166
I'll keep doing some research
and see what I can find out.

255
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,125
[MITSUKI]
Thank you so much.

256
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,708
No prob. You be careful
going back home, okay?

257
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,041
Sure, thanks again

258
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,625
and I'm sorry to have kept
both of you up so late.

we're having our
New Year's party tomorrow,

all about timing!

miss my chance,

in the middle of a tantrum.

00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,541
But this is good,
I've wanted to talk to you.

277
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,625
It's an unexpected honor
to have you pour me

278
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,541
a drink personally, my lord.

279

Consider it my way
of saying thanks.

I haven't done anything
to deserve such gratitude.

You're far too kind, my lord.

282
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,958
And besides, it's like
I've said in the past.

283
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:13,250
Slaying fools who kill women
and children is my duty,

284
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,708
and it's my way of
remembering my own.

285
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,458
I'm aware.

286
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,666
[SCARFIOR chuckles]
Fine, I'll accept it.

287

Delicious, thank you.

288
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,083
I need a favor.

289
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,833
Would you punch me in the
face as hard as you can?

290
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,500
That's a rather sudden
and odd request.

291
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,375
When we fought the Panther Clan,

292
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,750
the reason our wall was broken

293
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,583
is because I hesitated
in the middle of battle.

294

We lost a lot of good
soldiers that day.

Those men are only
dead because of me.

[SCARFIOR sighs]

297
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,791
I disagree, or perhaps I have a
different view on that moment.

298
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,291
We were only able to escape
with so few casualties

299
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,875
because we had you leading us.

300
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,625
Nobody in the Wolf Clan
is in a position to judge you,

301
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,750
nor would they.

302
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:07,625
So you say, but I still
can't forgive myself!

303
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,208
Even after such a
colossal failure,

304
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,750
there are still times when
I'm more focused on my old world

than this one!

If you want my opinion,

308
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,333
it sounds like you're
trying to bear

309
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,375
too many burdens
simultaneously.

310
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,916
I suppose that's
not surprising,

311
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,583
given how much you excel
in everything else you do.

[SCARFIOR]
My lord.

313

I can assure you, this drink
will serve you much better

314
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,291
than a punch from
me ever could.

315
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,000
And it'll probably
taste better, too.

00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,458

00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,250
If you get in our way,
things are gonna get ugly!

475
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,625
[CHRISTINA]
Silence!

476
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:17,083
Don't you fools have any
idea who you're speaking to?

477
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,291
Standing before you

478
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,166
is the Eighth Patriarch
of the Wolf Clan!

479
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,666
I present our father,
Lord Yuuto Suou!

480
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,500
--Yay, it's our Father!
--[MEN laughing]

481
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,500
What? Don't be ridiculous.

482
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,541
Yeah, the patriarch's not gonna
come to some dumpy tavern

483
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:30,333
in the middle of the--

484
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,291
[MEN gasping]

485
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:37,625
[MAN B] That black hair,
those dark eyes. It can't be!

486
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,958
It's the Dark One.

487
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:43,083
You are all in the presence of
the Patriarch of the Wolf Clan!

488
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,166
Show some respect and bow
before him, peasants!

489
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,500
Everybody bow! Bow party!

490
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,916
[MEN gasping, shuddering]

491
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,208
That's going too far.

492
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,416
Huh?!

493
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,333
[YUUTO]
Mitsuki?

494
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,375
Hey, let's do a
serious preview today!

495
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,500
Why? I've heard no one
even watches the previews.

496
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,625
Oh no!

497
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,708
Maybe because we're
not strong enough.

498
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,125
--Quickly, we should both train!
--Yeah!

499
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,791
First a thousand sit-ups!

500
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,916
Good! Only 998 more to go!

501
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,208
[ALBERTINA]
That's too many, aah!

502
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,041
This isn't fun at all.
