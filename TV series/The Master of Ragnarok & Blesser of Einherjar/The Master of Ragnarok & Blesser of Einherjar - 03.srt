[STEIN laughs]

162
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,541
It's been a while since
someone gave me a chill.

163
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,458
I think I might like you, yeah.

164
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,333
That doesn't make
me happy at all,

165
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,333
and I certainly don't like you.

166
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,666
Ouch, my feelings!

167
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,166
Got a question,
if that's okay with you.

168
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,375
What's your name,
Wolf Patriarch?

169
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,291
It's Yuuto.

170
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,500
Yuuto Suoh.

171
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,625
Yuuto Suoh, huh?

172
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,958
I'll try to make an effort
to remember that one.

[RUN, FELICIA sigh]

I won't lie, I was pretty
frightened for a moment.

175
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:12,416
That guy's strong, a total jerk,
but strong nonetheless.

176
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,291
[ALEXIS]
So, what did you think of him?

177
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,541
You certainly put yourself
in a lot of danger

178
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,041
to meet the Wolf Patriarch.

179

[STEIN scoffs]

180
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,625
[STEIN] For a man rumored
to destroy the entire world,

181
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,958
he was even more interesting
than I expected.

182
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:39,458
[ALEXIS] Hm... Then, will you
grant our request?

183
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,583
We're really depending
on your strength and abilities.

184
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,791
Please, Lord Steinthor.

185

[STEIN]
Sure.

187

Finally, a fight that I can
actually get excited over.

[chuckles]

189
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,375
[MITSUKI on phone] Do you know
how worried I was about you?

190
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,166
How can you say that
you're going off to war,

191
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,916
and then not contact me
for three whole weeks?

192
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,041
[YUUTO]
I'm sorry, Mitsuki!

193
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,083
[MITSUKI] Look, I understand
that you're dealing with all

194
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,958
kinds of problems right now,

195
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,125
and that someone like me
could probably never get

196
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,125
what you're going through.

197
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,541
Yeah?

198
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,083
But you're managing
an entire clan now,

199
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,666
so I'm sure I don't
need to remind you

200
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,916
how important
the three C's are.

201
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,458
What are they?

202
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,916
Uh...

203
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,833
Let's see.
Contact, communication, and...

204
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,000
...consult?

205
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,541
That's right.

206
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,000
And newsflash, you haven't done
any of those things for me.

207
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,500
You could've at least texted me!

208
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,541
[YUUTO]
Right.

209
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:58,583
[MITSUKI sobs]

210
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,875
I'm sorry. I'm just...
so glad you're not dead.

211
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,416
[gasps]

[MITSUKI sobs]

213
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:19,083
[YUUTO]
Mitsuki, it's fine. I'm okay.

214
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:23,083
I should have called
you sooner. I'm sorry.

215
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,375
I never meant to make you worry.

216
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,166
Are things better?
Like, more peaceful, now?

217
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,250
Uh-huh.

218
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,208
[YUUTO]
They are.

219
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:54,375
[FELICIA] Everything seems to be
in order here in the market.

220
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,750
[YUUTO] Yes, but part of
my duty as the Patriarch

221
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,583
is to tour the city.

222
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,041
Gather around!

223
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:04,083
These books are imported
straight from the Claw Clan.

224
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,583
[FELICIA] You know, this
prosperity is only made possible

225
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,750
because of the paper
you invented.

226
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,500
And because our merchants are
selling it in other countries,

227
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,291
now the Wolf Clan's economy
is finally flourishing.

228
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,416
I can't take credit for
inventing paper, Felicia.

229
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,916
Uh...

230

[BOTH gasping]

231
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:26,333
This mother and child pair
are my top items for today!

232
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,416
Look at their snow-white skin,

233
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,375
unique to the people
of the north!

234
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,291
And I'm certain this
girl will grow up

235
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,791
to be as beautiful
as her dear mother.

236
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,833
I'm so scared.

237
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,708
Looks like he's a slave trader.

238
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:43,750
[YUUTO gasps]
Selling a girl that young?

[SLAVE TRADER]
So, do I have any takers?

240
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,416
Right here.

241
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,583
Oh, well, if it isn't
our Patriarch!

242

I'm so very honored
to serve you, sir!

243
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:52,958
How will you be paying?

244
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:53,791
Felicia.

245
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,375
Okay.

246
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,625
[FELICIA]
I believe this should suffice.

247
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,666
Thank you. That amount
is more than enough.

Hey, guard, come over here!

Take these two to my
grand chamberlain.

See that they're
well taken care of.

Yes, sir!

254
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:43,208
Not that it matters.
It's still slavery.

255
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,958
[YUUTO] All I can do is change
what I can and help who I can.

256
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,416
One step at a time.

257
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,083
That's right.

Huh...

00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,500

Aw, man.

261
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,416
How can there be this
much paperwork?

262
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,000
What did you expect?

263
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,333
We never dealt with it
after fighting the Horn Clan.

264
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,791
We immediately ran off
to a new battle.

265
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,250
So, now,
there's double the work.

That's true. Sorry.

This is probably the last
thing you wanna be doing.

It's fine.

If I help you with your work,

you all to myself.

There are envoys
from the Claw here.

I apologize.

I did tell her it
was a bad idea,

but I'm afraid she insisted.

to sneak in here after her?

pass the blame onto me, sis.

00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,291
[CHRISTINA]
Let's start over.

320
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:39,041
I am the Claw patriarch's
daughter by blood.

321
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,791
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Christina.

322
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,375
And I'm her older sister,
Albertina!

323
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,083
[CHRISTINA] We were sent here by
order of the Claw Patriarch.

324
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,250
He wishes for my sister
and me to marry you

325
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,958
and become your wives.

326
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:54,125
I'm sure we'll all have
a very happy life together.

327
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,500
Huh?

328
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:56,750
Huh?

329
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:57,875
[gasps]

330
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,833
Marry me?!

331
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,833
[YUUTO] Well, I never agreed
to marry either of you.

332
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,541
You can't just show up
and say things like that.

333
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,291
I'll have to ask you to leave.

334
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,125
Aw! No fair! You can't
just throw us out

335
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,083
after we've traveled
all the way here!

336
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,333
I have to agree.

337
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,250
The entire journey,
she kept telling me,

338
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,333
"I've heard that
he's really amazing,

339
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,083
but I've also heard he can
come off as kinda scary."

340
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,625
Then there's,
"Oh, I bet he's so handsome!"

341
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,291
And roleplaying.

342
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,250
[imitating YUUTO] "Albertina,
say that you'll be mine!

343
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,208
I want to be with you forever!"

344
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,791
[imitating ALBERTINA]
"Of course, Lord Yuuto!"

345
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,916
Considering how much she
just embarrassed herself,

346
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,333
the least you could do
is be a little bit nicer.

347
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,416
Show some compassion
for the poor girl.

348
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,958
[ALBERTINA whines]

349
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,500
Uh, now that you know
my deepest, darkest secrets,

350
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,291
please reconsider our offer!

351
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,958
Hey, even if Lord Yuuto
thinks you're hopeless,

352
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,500
I just want you to know:

353
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,875
I, your little sister, love you
and will never abandon you.

354
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,458
That didn't even make sense.

355
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,125
[ALBERTINA]
Wow, really? Thank you, Chris!

356
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,208
I'm sorry I'm so hopeless!

357
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,875
You're the only person
I can depend on!

358
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,291
You're so cute when you cry.

359
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,291
Is it me, or do they seem
a little high-maintenance?

360
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,708
I could be wrong,

361
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,500
but I suspect their Patriarch
may have sent them here

362
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,416
just to get some
peace and quiet.

363
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,708
Yeah, I agree.

364
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:16,958
[CHRISTINA]
Are you trying to suggest

365
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,208
that our Patriarch
wants to get rid of us?

366
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,583
[ALBERTINA]
How rude!

367
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:21,750
[YUUTO]
You heard that?

368
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,583
We sure did!
And don't act so surprised.

369
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,291
We are Einherjar, you know!

370
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,750
If they are indeed Einherjar,

371
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,041
it would be extremely rude
of us to ask them to leave.

372
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,750
Look, no matter
what you two may be,

373
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:38,750
it doesn't change the fact that
I never agreed to marry you.

374
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,166
Is it because you're too busy

375
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,500
preparing to marry the Patriarch
of the Horn Clan? Maybe?

376
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,125
[BOTH gasping]

377
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,750
Well, it looks like you
really do hear everything.

378
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,666
[CHRISTINA chuckles]
Uh-huh.

379
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,625
Including the truth about
the so-called massacre at Van,

380
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:56,125
you know, the city you always
mention in your negotiations?

381
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,958
[gasps]

382
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,958
[CHRISTINA] Of course, we
haven't told anybody about it.

383
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,375
I see your information-gathering
abilities are quite impressive.

384
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:09,041
I think you'd be better
suited to be my children.

385
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,625
[CHRISTINA]
Well, what a coincidence.

386
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,208
I wasn't really
all that interested

387
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,791
in this silly talk of marriage
or concubines anyway.

388
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,583
Honestly, I'd never let
you touch my sister.

389
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,875
Well, then what was the
point of coming here?

390
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,083
Do you want the truth?

391
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,125
The real reason we
came all this way was

392
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,916
to test you, Lord Yuuto.

393
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,291
That's it! I've heard enough!

394
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,666
I've held my tongue because
you're both princesses,

395
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,458
but you've been
nothing but rude!

396
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:34,208
I can't believe you would
dare test my father!

397
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,166
[YUUTO]
Hold on, Run.

398
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,916
The reason you told me the truth

399
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,333
is because you're satisfied
with what you see, right?

400
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,916
I am.

401
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,791
[CHRISTINA] Patriarch of
the Wolf Clan, Lord Yuuto,

402
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:54,958
we two sisters have never had
a father by oath before now.

403
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,458
We have but only
one life to give,

404
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,458
but we would gladly
give it to you,

405
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,125
the greatest
chalice of Yggdrasil.

406
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,750
[YUUTO]
I'm happy I impressed you,

407
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,916
but there's no need
for compliments now.

408
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,375
They're not just empty words,
Lord Yuuto.

409
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,125
We're quite serious
about this offer.

410
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,375
We would be very honored
to join your family.

411
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,333
Please consider it.

412
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,583
[YUUTO] I get the
feeling that these twins

413
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,875
might still be hiding
something from me.

414
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,291
Even so, they are Einherjar,

415
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,000
and I still have
that jerk Steinthor

416
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,666
that I have to worry about.

417
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,291
[YUUTO]
Okay, I'll consider it.

418
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,291
But you have to
prove yourselves.

419
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:42,666
[gasps] Hold on.
Why do we have to do that?

420
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,583
[YUUTO]
Good luck.

421
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,125
The chalice of the Wolf
patriarch is special.

422
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,208
You'll have to earn it.

423
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:35,125
I hope that one day I have
big boobs just like Felicia's!

424
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,958
I hear they grow better
if they're fondled.

425
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,041
Wait. Is that true? Then, Chris,
will you maybe touch--

426
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:40,375
No way.

427
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:41,958
Only an imposter would
refuse to fondle my chest!

428
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:45,208
Actually, I just wanna see you
worry about your teensy boobies.

429
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,958
I guess it is the real Chris.
