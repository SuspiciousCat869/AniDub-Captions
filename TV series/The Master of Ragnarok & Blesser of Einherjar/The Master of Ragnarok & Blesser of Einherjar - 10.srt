00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,666
[LEAFA]
I, Divine Emperor Sigrdrifa,

2
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,166
heir to the Holy
Asgarthor Empire,

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,458
Beseech thee, oh moon,
source of all Asmegin,

4
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,833
to please bless the
people of our country

5
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:31,375
with a bountiful harvest
in the coming new year.

6
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:39,416
Bless our empire with
prosperity and long life.

7
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,166
[LEAFA]
And with that,

8
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,291
the New Year's prayer
has been concluded.

9
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,166
I can't help but wonder
who will conduct

10
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,250
the New Year's Ceremony back
home since I'm not there.

11
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,750
[YUUTO]
"Cornered Wolf."

12
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,708
Well, I'm glad you're back,
Big Brother.

13
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:38,916
Did you have fun on your
little midnight stroll?

14
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You sound angry.
Did I do something wrong?

15
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,666
Yes and no.

16
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,125
It's just that being
your bodyguard

17
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,166
used to be my
prime responsibility,

18
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,708
but lately, it seems like
Chris is fulfilling that role.

19
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,416
Yeah, but that's only because
her skills are a bit more useful

20
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,375
for walking around undetected.

21
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,625
I'm well aware of her skills.

22
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,541
So, uh...

23
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,083
...in other news, we may need
to prepare a guest room.

24
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,708
[gasps]
How'd Mitsuki get here?

25
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,416
--Were you summoned?
--[LEAFA] Huh?

26
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,750
That's actually not Mitsuki.

27
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:08,833
This is Lady Leafa.

28
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,791
She's a princess
of the Jarl Clan.

29
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,458
You know, from over in the
Holy Asgarthor Empire?

30
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,666
I apologize for any rudeness
caused by my ignorance.

31
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,416
As it turns out, she was
traveling around in secret,

32
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,666
but upon finding her,

33
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,750
we believed it best to
welcome her as a guest.

34
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,125
So, here we are.

35
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,500
It's more rundown
than I expected.

36
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,083
[ALL gasping]

37
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:34,125
Our humble quarters are nothing
compared to an imperial palace.

38
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:37,208
I assure you that you'll have
the finest welcome we can offer.

39
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,041
Would it be all right
if I look around?

40
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,833
Of course, feel free to explore
as much as you like.

41
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,416
Since you're
staying here for now,

42
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,791
I should probably
go back to the inn

43
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,833
and inform your guards
of your whereabouts.

44
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes. I'm sure they're
worried since I snuck out.

45
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,791
I'd appreciate it.

46
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,791
As usual, you did
an excellent job.

47
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,333
There's no need to
keep hiding, though.

48
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,916
It seems I wasn't
hiding well enough.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,458
Detecting the unknown
is my specialty.

50
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,041
But, fortunately for you,
I don't believe it's Father's.

51
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,208
Thank goodness! If he
knew I was guarding him,

52
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,750
then he'd probably
be more on edge

53
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,500
when walking around the market.

54
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,166
Did you need something?

55
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,000
Lady Leafa, what do
you think of her?

56
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,666
She's quite powerful.

57
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,500
Yes, even if I were
to catch her off guard,

58
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,375
I don't think I could beat her.

59
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:26,083
That may be true, but her
skills are unrefined.

60
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,416
I would describe her
as a diamond in the rough.

61
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,583
I'm sure you're right.

62
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,083
Detecting fighting skill
is your specialty.

63
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:35,041
Well, she's no mere princess.
That said,

64
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,625
I don't believe she's
a threat to Father.

65
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,375
He's the Dark One?

66
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,166
Hard to believe.

67
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,666
[knocking on door]

68
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,291
[FELICIA]
Big Brother! It's Leafa!

69
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,166
[YUUTO] Did she manage
to find more trouble?

70
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,916
Yes, at the workshop!

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,625
[LEAFA]
Do you have wax in your ears?

72
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,666
Lord Yuuto said I could explore
the palace as much as I like,

73
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,166
so I do have permission!

74
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,333
I'm so sorry, My Lady,

75
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,750
but unfortunately
I have to see a pass!

76
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,458
I don't need a pass!

77
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:07,875
[YUUTO]
Oh, no!

78
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,625
Forgive me, Lady Leafa.

79
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,541
I'm afraid this
room is off limits.

80
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,083
Say what?

81
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:17,166
It's nothing personal, but entry
is forbidden to other clans.

82
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,291
[LEAFA]
Even me, Lord Yuuto?

83
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:23,041
Uh, well, the thing is...

84
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:27,583
Uh... Uh-huh.

85
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,041
In that case, I guess
I'll have to use force.

86
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,916
[INGRID] What the heck
is going on out here?

87
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,250
[INGRID]
Mitsuki? But how?

88
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,083
Did you get called
to this world too?

89
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,416
Actually, it's not
what you think, Ingrid.

90
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,208
She just looks like Mitsuki.

91
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,958
Okay, then who is she?

92
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, wow! I can't believe
I'm meeting the Lady Ingrid,

93
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,416
the famous blacksmith!

94
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,125
I've heard so many good things!

95
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,250
Uh... who are you again?

96
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,666
Princess of the Jarl Clan,
Lady Leafa.

97
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,791
The Jarl Clan?

98
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,208
Hey, they're old
customers of ours!

99
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,458
That's the third time now
somebody's mistaken me

100
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,833
for this Mitsuki person.

101
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,166
Where is this mysterious
girl everyone knows?

102
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,875
Well, pretty far away
at the moment, actually.

103
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,416
Ah, and could someone explain
what Lady Ingrid meant

104
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,208
about her being
"called to this world"?

105
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,250
That's a very unusual thing to
say to someone, don't you think?

106
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah, you've got a point there.

107
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,625
Listen, I know this might
be tough to believe,

108
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,291
but the truth is that I actually
came here to Yggdrasil

109
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,791
from another world entirely.

110
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,541
Oh? How exactly?

111
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,666
Uh... Well, um,
it'll sound crazy,

112
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,708
but in my world,
I looked into a holy mirror,

113
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,541
which I think was made
of elven copper,

114
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:38,208
and then, the next thing I know,
I was sent to this world

115
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,708
where Felicia was
standing in the room

116
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,125
performing the hidden
magic called Gleipnir.

117
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,083
If that is truly what happened,
then that means

118
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,000
that there should be an elven
copper mirror here in Iarnvithr.

119
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,083
But how could you know that?

120
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,708
Well, as it happens, the Empire
is the world's frontrunner

121
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,541
in the study of elven copper
and divine secret magics!

122
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,333
Please tell me more! It could
be extremely important.

123
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,583
I suppose.

124
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,541
And I do owe you for
saving me last night.

125
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,416
But first...

126
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,500
I am starving!
Can we have lunch?

127
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,625
Whoa! This is so delicious!

128
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,916
It's a hamburger, a dish we like
to make back in my world.

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,333
There are a few differences

130
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,208
since some of the ingredients
are hard to get here.

131
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:20,375
Whew! That was quite the feast.
Your weird food was oddly tasty!

132
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,375
Thank you. So, uh...

133
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,833
Right, of course.

134
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,208
What is it you would like
to know about secret magics?

135
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,791
Mostly, I'm just interested

136
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,166
in finding a way to get
back to my own world.

137
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,541
[LEAFA]
You can't go back?

138
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,291
No.

139
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,333
There's something odd about
the way you say it happened.

140
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,916
Oh, what's that?

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,458
[LEAFA] I don't feel that much
divine power emanating from you.

142
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,500
I'm not trying to sound mean,
but it's obvious

143
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,708
that you're a
below-average magic user.

144
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:49,166
Yes, I'm well aware of my
weakness in that regard.

145
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,250
Even with one half
of a pair of mirrors,

146
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,833
you don't possess
nearly enough power

147
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,500
to summon a person from a
different world by yourself.

148
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,083
I'm pretty strong, and not
even I could manage that.

149
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,458
Are you a magic user, too,
Lady Leafa?

150
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,416
Naturally, but I'm not
just any old magic user.

151
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,625
In fact, I happen to be
the most powerful one

152
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,208
--in all of Yggdrasil.
--[YUUTO groans]

153
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,333
Are you implying you
don't believe me?

154
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:13,666
No, I'm not saying that,
but I did do a bunch of research

155
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,208
on the top magic
users of this land,

156
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,250
and I don't remember seeing
your name anywhere on the list.

157
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,208
Go. Raising.

158
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:26,000
[YUUTO grunting]
What did you just do?

159
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,000
I can't move!

160
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,083
How dare you?
Explain yourself!

161
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:32,666
What? I was just demonstrating
my power to Lord Yuuto.

162
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,083
[FELICIA] Two runes?
You mean like Steinthor? How?

163
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,166
No! That's not possible!

164
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,875
There's only supposed
to be one other person

165
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,166
with two runes
in all of Yggdrasil.

166
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,041
But that would mean you're...

167
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,375
Oops, here we go.

168
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:50,291
You're actually the
Divine Emperor Sigrdrifa?

169
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,458
[sighs]
That was stupid of me.

170
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,791
I managed to blow my
cover on the first day.

171
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,708
[FELICIA]
Was I right?

172
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:57,958
Yes.

173
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,125
Before you is the
13th Divine Emperor

174
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:04,666
of the Holy Asgarthor Empire.
I am Lady Sigrdrifa!

175
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,125
[FELICIA]
Please forgive my impertinence!

176
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,750
[YUUTO]
Yeah, sorry.

177
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,541
So, can you please
undo the spell?

178
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,458
My face hurts.

179
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,083
[chuckles]

180
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,875
[LEAFA] Well, you see, there are
two major types of magic:

181
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,416
Spells with internal effects,

182
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,625
and spells with
external effects.

183
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,708
The spell I just used,
"Raising," is the internal kind.

184
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,416
[YUUTO]
Yeah, that's fascinating.

185
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,458
But the spell, please undo it.
My body is so heavy.

186
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,125
Because Raising is a spell
of the internal variety,

187
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,666
it will require an external
spell to negate it.

188
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,708
Some people are better at
certain spells than others.

189
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,916
[YUUTO]
Don't tell me.

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,041
I'm very good at
the internal spells

191
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,291
but terrible at external ones!

192
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,083
[YUUTO]
That's a really peppy way

193
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,791
of admitting you can't
undo the spell.

194
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:51,583
At least it was an abbreviated
one with no chanting or ritual.

195
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,333
That means it should expire
on its own after a week.

196
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,958
[YUUTO]
Felicia, can't you do something?

197
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,291
Sorry, Big Brother,

198
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,958
but it's too powerful
for me to undo.

199
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,916
If you're really desperate
to get it fixed sooner,

200
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,500
I'm sure Sigyn,
the Witch of Mithgarthor,

201
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,458
would be able to
undo it immediately.

202
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,708
[YUUTO]
Sigyn? From the Panther Clan?

203
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,291
Oh, good. So you
already know her!

204
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,750
There's a rumor that
she can use Fimbulvetr,

205
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,458
a spell that can supposedly
release one from their bonds.

206
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,708
Big Brother!

207
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,541
[YUUTO]
Then that light was...

208
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,208
[MITSUKI] Huh? You met a
girl who looks like me?

209
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,375
[YUUTO]
Yeah.

210
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,875
Her hair and eyes
are a different color,

211
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,916
but other than that, she could
practically be your twin.

212
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,041
What's her name?

213
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,041
[YUUTO on phone]
Leafa.

214
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,041
[gasps]

215
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,750
[YUUTO on phone]
Huh? What's wrong?

216
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,958
Nothing, her name just sounds
familiar for some reason.

217
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,500
[YUUTO]
Anyway, thanks to her,

218
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,375
I may have a lead
on getting home.

219
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:48,541
[MITSUKI screams]

220
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,041
Ow, my ear!

221
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,083
It's only a lead. There's still
a lot to figure out, okay?

222
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,291
Tell me everything!

223
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,416
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

224
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,500
So, if I have someone cast a
spell called Fimbulvetr on me,

225
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,500
then I should be
able to come home,

226
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,375
but the only one who can
do it works for an enemy clan.

227
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,875
[MITSUKI]
Don't give up hope just yet!

228
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,583
Maybe there's someone besides
Sigyn who can cast it.

229
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:13,041
Good idea! I'll start
looking into it right away.

230
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:16,500
Talking to you always
gets me fired up!

231
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,500
I believe I'll see
you again, Yuuto.

232
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:25,333
[YUUTO]
Here's to the New Year. A toast!

233
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,666
[CROWD]
A toast!

234
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,166
[CROWD laughing and cheering]

235
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,583
[groaning]

236
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,875
Man, these official
ceremonies are exhausting.

237
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,166
[FELICIA]
Big Brother,

238
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,166
this is a gift from all
of us for the New Year.

239
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,083
I love it!

240
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,500
That's so thoughtful
of all of you.

241
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,500
Right, time for the
unofficial ceremony.

242
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:51,666
We should probably keep

243
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,041
Lady Leafa's identity
a secret for now.

244
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,208
Sure! We can use
our private ceremony

245
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,666
to welcome
"Lady Leafa" properly!

246
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,125
Just leave everything
to me, Big Brother!

247
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,083
[sighs] I don't think
I can drink a drop more!

248
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,500
Here! You're almost empty!

249
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,625
Eat your fill
while you can, Effy!

250
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,708
A warrior never passes up
the opportunity to eat!

251
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,333
[ALBERTINA laughs]

252
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,166
That's some welcome!

253
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,083
I think it's wonderful,
Lord Yuuto!

254
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,500
I've never been to
a New Year banquet

255
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,416
that was quite
like this before.

256
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,416
-[YUUTO] Uh...
-Big Brother, listen...

257
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,958
...can I please have just
a little bit of your seed?

258
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:32,458
[CHRISTINA] Oh, you're
so funny, Auntie Linnea!

259
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,458
But the Claw Clan would
also like your seed.

260
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,666
[groaning]
It's so hot in here.

261
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,000
Don't rip your clothes off!

262
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,916
Oh, I beg your forgiveness,
Big Brother.

263
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,500
Would you prefer that I remove
them a bit more slowly?

264
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,083
[YUUTO]
Uh... What?

265
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,166
Okay, then, allow me to go next.

266
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:48,875
[YUUTO]
Huh?

267
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,458
Then I'm doing it, too.

268
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:53,375
[YUUTO]
No, don't!

269
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,833
I won't let you all beat me!

270
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:55,750
[YUUTO]
Hold on!

271
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,125
We'll join you.

272
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,500
--Yay!
--[YUUTO] Seriously?

273
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,583
Please, stop.
Stop stripping!

274
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,875
[LINNEA] I just want your seed!
Why is that so difficult?

275
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,083
[FELICIA]
No, me, first!

276
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,000
[CHRISTINA]
The Claw Clan has first claim!

277
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,458
[YUUTO] I told you I'm in love
with a girl back home!

278
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,583
So good!

279

--[GIRLS laughing]

-[YUUTO groaning]
-[ALL GIRLS] Huh?

281
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,958
[CHRISTINA] Father, Albertina
and I have just returned

282
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,583
from our most recent
scouting mission.

283
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,041
We have bad news.

284
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,750
We came across a Lightning
Clan army 8,000 strong,

285
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,083
and being led by none other
than Steinthor himself.

286
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,250
You did? And they're
heading here?

287
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:40,416
Yes. I apologize for not
spotting the force sooner.

288
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,625
Gather our troops immediately!

289
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:43,791
Right!

290
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,625
Oh, my! That's quite a view!

291
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,833
[YUUTO]
Twelve thousand men in all.

292
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,916
I'm sorry, but it looks like
I'll have to leave for a while.

293
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,166
I understand that you need
to protect your people,

294
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,625
but... can you really win?

295
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,625
I never fight a battle
if I know I can't win.

296
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,541
Although our Horn Clan
allies are still stuck

297
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,416
in a skirmish with
the Panther Clan,

298
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,458
which means we can't count
on them for reinforcements.

299
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,708
I feel a little bad that I've
spent three whole months here

300
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,375
and have done nothing to
reward you for your kindness.

301
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,000
Here, lean forward.

302
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,541
[YUUTO grunts]

303
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,416

[BOTH gasping]

305
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,666
What'd you kiss me for?

306

[LEAFA]
That was a good luck kiss

307
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,791
from the Divine Emperor!

308
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,458
Try sounding less surprised
and a bit more grateful.

309
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,500
I am grateful.
I'd just rather you didn't.

310
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,750
That's the rudest thing
anyone's ever said to me!

00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,833
I'm sorry.

312
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:50,833
No, it's okay. I can't expect
you to know all our customs.

313
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:54,500
All right then, I'll be waiting
to hear of your victory!

314
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,166
I have to say,

315
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,458
I didn't expect Fort Gashina
to fall to so quickly.

316
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,166
[CHRISTINA] The Lightning Clan
army made camp

317
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,333
in front of the fort.

318
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,958
They're waiting for
us here and here.

319
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,500
With our iron weapons,

320
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,041
we can typically hold our own
in straight-forward battles.

321
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,541
But if Steinthor
is leading them,

322
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:14,041
we'll be wasting our men's lives
without some kind of plan.

323
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,291
Right, time for another
plan from Han Xin.

324
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,041
We'll lure out the tiger.

325
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,416
Run, you lead the right flank.

326
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,458
Scarfior, the left.

327
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,208
In the center...

328
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,166
I can count on you to
watch my back, right?

329
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,625
Yes, of course. Just focus
on the vanguard, Father.

330
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:43,166
Okay, everyone,
onward to victory!

331
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,291
[SOLDIERS shouting]

332
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,416
[FELICIA]
The Lightning Clan troops

333
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,291
sort of resemble an arrow.

334
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,458
Yeah, arrowhead formation.
It's an assault pattern,

335
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,708
and it looks like
Steinthor is leading it.

336
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,125
Wait. Is he riding a horse?

337
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,291
[FELICIA]
And he has a new weapon!

338
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,000
[YUUTO] I can't imagine
that being useful

339
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,708
for anything, though.

340
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:10,125
[STEIN] So those are
the wagon forts, huh?

341
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,500
[chuckles]

342
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,666
[SOLDIER A]
Crossbows, fire!

343
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,500
[yells]

344
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:22,875
Huh?

345
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,666
[FELICIA]
The crossbows aren't working!

346
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,166
Is that umbrella
seriously made of iron?

347
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,333
How on Earth does he manage
to wave it around like that?

348
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,666
Time for some payback!
Here you go!

349
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,541
--[STEIN shouts]
--[SOLDIERS shouting]

350
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,458
[YUUTO] You know, it's unfair
how much that guy cheats.

351
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,666
He broke through the wagon forts
with nothing but brute strength!

352
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,833
It'll be okay!
The plan was always

353
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,875
that they'd be broken
through eventually.

354
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,875
But isn't the Lightning Clan's
advance a little too strong?

355
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,166
What? Iron?

356
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,875
Yes, it would appear that
the Lightning Clan forces

357
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,750
are all equipped
with iron weapons.

358
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,250
Hold on. The Panther Clan!

359
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,708
You think there's a connection
between them, the weapons,

360
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,541
and Steinthor being
on horseback?

361
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,708
If they're working together,
then it explains everything.

362
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,500
This is bad.

363
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,333
Once again, I failed
to find out in time.

364
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,083
Our second rank
was broken through!

365
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,666
[YUUTO] Tell everyone to fall
back! Do not engage the enemy!

366
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,291
Messenger, go back
and inform Thjalfi

367
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,166
that we've broken through
the enemy's ranks!

368
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,750
Yuuto Suou must have
something up his sleeve.

369
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,250
Stay sharp, everyone!

370
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,250
Tell all units that it's time!

371
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,750
Deploy the kouyaku formation!

372
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,833
[horn sounding]

373
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,125
Let's go!

374
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,833
Onward!

375
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,875
What's going on?

376
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,375
[SOLDIER B]
Enemies from the north!

377
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,208
[SOLDIER C]
Ambushers from the south!

378
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,708
Calm down! We told you.

379
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:08,375
This is all just part of
the Wolf Clan's strategy!

380
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:11,208
[SOLDIER D] Sir, the enemy
is pushing back from the rear!

381
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,000
[THJALFI]
What?

382
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,416
Damn it!.

383
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,916
Kouyaku formation?

384
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,083
Yep. You deploy your
forces in two rows.

385
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,958
Then you make the enemy
think they're winning

386
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,375
and lure them in
where you crush them.

387
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,625
They fell for our trap

388
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,125
and jumped right into
the fangs of the Wolf.

389
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,500
[STEIN] Looks like you've
done it again, Yuuto Suou.

390
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,833
You really are
a clever leader.

391
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,416
[THJALFI]
Father!

392
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,125
[THJALFI]
I think we should withdraw.

393
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,958
Yes, I agree.

394
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,416
But not to our rear.

395
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,083
If we do that, then he'll
have us totally surrounded.

396
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,666
Death is behind us!
Tell our men

397
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,875
if they want to survive this,
then we need to run forward!

398
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,708
Don't worry. I'll open
the path for everyone!

399
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,250
[laughs]

400
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,541
[YUUTO] He saw the trap
and is still going forward?

401
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,041
Well, I don't know if it's
his idiocy or instinct at work,

402
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,541
but that was
the right answer.

403
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,333
Not that it will
do him much good.

404
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,833
We can take down as many
of your 8,000 men as we can,

405
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,000
Dolgthrasir!

406
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,958
Get out of my way!

[shouts]

408
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,583
It's about time you showed up!

409
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,000
[THJALFI]
Father!

410
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,875
[STEIN] Thjalfi, take our troops
and keep moving forward!

411
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,500
I'll handle things here!

412
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,000
Plus, if I don't take
the she-wolf's head,

413
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,708
I know that I'll regret it.

414
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,250
You heard him!

415
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,750
If you want to survive, you need
to push forward immediately!

416
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:44,083
[SOLDIERS shouting]

417
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,041
There's no turning back!

418
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,500
Big Brother,

419
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,458
it looks like they're going
to break the encirclement.

420
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,291
We have to motivate our forces

421
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,250
and defeat the enemy
no matter what!

422
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,083
Honestly, I didn't put
that many troops

423
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,041
to our front to begin with.
We won't follow them.

424
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,875
But why not? This could be
our chance at victory!

425
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,791
[YUUTO] I once read you should
never fight a desperate foe.

426
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,250
Right now,
Steinthor and his army

427
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,250
think their only chance
at survival is to go forward.

428
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,166
They're desperate.

429
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,375
For now, the first
battle is ours.

430
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,416
Let's move on.

Terrible news!

I just saw mounted units
heading this way from the south,

and... they're 10,000 strong!

For real?

They're almost here.
I'm sorry.

437
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:31,208
But that's impossible.

438
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,708
I'm coming for what's mine,
Yuuto Suou.

439
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,000
There's nobody to bother us now.

440
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,416

Can't you hit me?

The scrawny wolf is back!
Took you long enough!

Well, at least things are
finally getting interesting.

Your skill is deflecting
my attacks, right?

--Things are really bad!

We'll just have to use the power

Say what now?

463
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,291
In his hour of need,
Linnea appears before him,

464
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:43,375
and the power of love has turned
her into the ultimate patriarch!

She trounces all
the enemies and...

466

I'm pretty sure it's not going
to go down that way.
