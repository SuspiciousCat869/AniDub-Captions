Father.

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,416
[RUN] I was so rude
that night. Forgive me.

3
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,708
How did I end up
in this position?

4
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:47,625
Well, if nothing else,
I'll just go easy on her.

5
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,666
Prepare yourself!

[YUUTO shouts]

00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,458
[RUN]
Just as I suspected.

8
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,541
We can't even use you
on the battlefield

9
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,208
as an infantry solider.

Too late!

No, this fight still isn't over!

14
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,041
Uh-oh.

Please watch over Father,

17
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,958

[YUUTO]
The time has come.

21
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,333
At last, the day has finally
come for me to crush those

22
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,083
wolf mongrels into dust.

23
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,000
I should warn you that
the Wolf Army is said

24
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,958
to use a variety of stratagems.

25
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,416
Wait here and see what
tactics they deploy.

26
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,666
Wait here?

27
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,750
Yes, I think that would
be the wisest action.

28
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,875
[STEIN scoffs]
But that's so boring!

29
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:42,083
Stop your whining
and do as Thjalif says.

30
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,416
Fine, I'll wait,

31
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,083
but only because you think
it's a good idea, Ving.

32
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,500
Okay, get ready!

33
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,375
Charge!

34
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:55,416
[SOLDIERS shouting]

35
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,041
[SOLDIERS grunting]

36
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,583
We're losing too many
troops on the front lines.

37
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,208
What? It looks like the
shields aren't helping.

38
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,500
I recently heard a rumor

39
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,166
that the Wolf army prefers
to use iron weapons,

40
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,208
including the tips
of all their arrows.

41
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,583
What?

42
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,291
But iron is so valuable.
Why waste it on arrowheads?

43
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,625
[THJALFI]
I couldn't tell you, My Lord.

44
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,375
Hey, looks like it's working.

45
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:27,250
Our crossbow technology comes
from the distant future.

46
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,458
Its power and range is
superior to his bows.

47
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,458
And they seem to be
more accurate as well.

48
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:36,625
Yeah, that's true, but it
still has its disadvantages.

49
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,791
You know, their arrows
may fly pretty far

50
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,041
and do a lot of damage,

51
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,375
but something I've noticed is

52
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,000
that there's a great deal
of lag between volleys.

53
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,041
Don't falter! Keep going!

54
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,583
We need to break through
the enemy's lines faster!

55
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,041
[SOLDIERS shouting]

56
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,041
It looks like they're
getting closer.

57
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,208
Right. Recall the crossbows!

58
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,500
Phalanxes, advance!

59
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,375
[gong sounding]

60
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:02,416
[SOLDIERS shouting]

61
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,250
We're pushing on
their front lines,

62
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,958
but what the heck is
going on with our army?

63
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,333
Why does it look like they're
still losing this battle?

64
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:11,666
I believe what you're seeing is

65
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,375
the Wolf Army's main
infantry unit, the Phalanx.

66
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:17,166
They typically send in their
cavalry to support them.

67
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,583
So those weird bows of
theirs are a new weapon,

68
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,083
but everything else is their
same old bag of tricks?

69
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,708
Okay then, Thjalif.
I believe I've seen enough.

70
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,583
Ving, you take the left flank!
Thjalif, you take the right!

71
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,458
And as usual,
I'll take the middle.

72
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,250
[CHRISTINA] Our phalanxes
have the advantage.

73
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,541
This almost seems
a little too easy.

74
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,250
I think we had a harder time
fighting the Hoof Clan.

75
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,416
They're so uncoordinated.

76
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,208
Maybe it's their commander.

77
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:46,666
[YUUTO] Don't get me wrong. I do
think that guy's a total idiot.

78
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,916
But there's more to him.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,833
No matter what, he's still
the leader of an army.

80
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,583
The Lightning Clan is known
for their strategists.

81
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,333
Oh, really? Well, part of
me wants nothing more

82
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,208
than to crush my opponent
when he's at his strongest.

83
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,125
But this isn't some game.

84
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,250
We can't give them a
chance to counterattack.

85
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,541
--[horn sounding]
--[reveille playing]

86
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,500
[RUN]
Right. That's the signal.

87
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:12,291
Everyone get ready!
We're going in!

88
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,958
Muspell squad, go! Attack!

89
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,750
[SOLDIERS shouting]

90
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,625
[SCARFIOR]
A hammer and anvil strategy?

91
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,250
[YUUTO]
Yes, it's our specialty.

92
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,208
We use the phalanx
to pin down the enemy,

93
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,416
then hit them from
the side on horseback.

94
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,291
[CHRISTINA] But look, they just
sent out their chariots.

95
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,208
I'm the Managarmr
of the Wolf Clan.

96
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,541
My name is Siegrune!

97
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:37,541
And I am the Ivaldi of the
Lightning Clan, Thjalif!

98
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,250
So you're the strategist
I've heard so much about.

99
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,125
Finally, an opponent
worth fighting!

100
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,333
Come at me!

Now die!

104
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,916
Wow! You nearly
defeated Thjalif.

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,750
That's pretty impressive.

106
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,958
Wanna give me a try?
Let's see what you can do!

107
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:18,791
[RUN,STEIN grunting]

108
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,583
There aren't many things
that can withstand my attacks.

109
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:34,750
That's quite a sword.

110
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:39,791
[RUN, STEIN grunting]

00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,166
Withdraw now!

115
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,416
[CHRISTINA]
Lord Yuuto,

116
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,000
the cavalry has just
left the battle.

117
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,250
So they repelled Run and
our anvil and hammer.

118
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,000
This is the first time
that our strategy

119
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,416
hasn't worked in a battle.

120
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,666
[FELICIA gasps]
Yes.

121
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,916
So, I told Run I wanted
her to get out of there

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,708
if she felt she
couldn't beat Steinthor.

123
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,500
I'm glad she did instead
of being stubborn.

124
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,000
The Tiger is a worthy foe,
which is no surprise

125
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,583
if even our ferocious
Managarmr had to retreat.

126
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,125
[YUUTO]
Well, this is a war.

127
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,000
No matter how strong
he may be alone,

128
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:26,125
we can still overwhelm
him with sheer numbers.

129
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,500
[STEIN grunting, shouting]

130
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:29,500
He's here.

131
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,041

[FELICIA] "Bravery of a fool.
Bravery that doesn't think,

but just relies on its
own strength instead."

136
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,500
I believe you've
also described it as

137

"bravery that depends
entirely on physical force."

Wow, you remember
that whole speech?

140
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,750
Of course, it'd be
impossible for me

to forget any of your pearls
of wisdom, Big Brother!

alone were enough to win,

146
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,750
there'd be no such
thing as tactics.

147

Just charging right into
our ranks with a chariot

148
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,875
makes him easy prey
for our phalanx.

Sir, our phalanx
is falling apart.

Seriously, that guy's a
worse cheater than I am.

Are you sure he's really human?

I had no idea the twin-runed
Einherjar was so powerful.

158

[YUUTO] His strength's enough
to uproot mountains,

cover the whole world.

00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,583
Steinthor really does
remind me of Xiang Yu.

161
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,791
Lord Yuuto, I believe it
would be wise to retreat.

162
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,666
[YUUTO grunts] Guess we won't
be finishing things here.

163
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,375
Please allow me
to be the rearguard.

164
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,750
Try not to die.

165
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:04,333
Don't worry. I'd hate
to die in this place.

166
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,875
See you in Valhalla!

167
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,625
--[SOLDIERS shouting]
--[STEIN laughing]

168
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,916
[SCARFIOR]
Withdraw! We're retreating!

169
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,083
--[gong sounding]
--[STEIN] Huh?

170
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,041
[SCARFIOR] Don't panic!
Stay in formation!

171
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,083
Withdraw quickly!

172
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,041
You won't escape me!

173
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,500
What the--

174
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,500
[STEIN shouts]

175
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,541
You're a decent warrior.

176
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,208
I guess I'll get your name.

177
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,041
Fine. Scarfior.

178
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, it looks like that
silver-haired she-wolf

179
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,791
isn't the best the Wolf Clan
had to offer after all.

180
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,416
So how is it that I haven't
heard of you before now?

181
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,916
If anything,

182
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,625
it's because I don't enjoy
being the center of attention.

183
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,958
Besides, of the two of us,
she's better to look at.

184
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,083
Don't worry. Give her
another two years,

185
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,416
and she'll surpass both my
strength and abilities.

186
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,833
I'm not interested
in the future.

187
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,250
I'm interested in
fighting you now!

188
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,750
While your words honor me,

189
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,291
I have no intention of fighting
you at this exact moment.

190
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:07,583
Come on. You're spoiling it!
I wanna have some fun!

191
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,583
[SCARFIOR]
Soldiers of the Lightning Clan!

192
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,666
What you see before you
on the ground is meteoric iron!

193
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,708
[SOLDIERS]
Huh?

194
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:16,750
[STEIN]
Hey, stop!

195
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,250
[SCARFIOR]
Iron! If you sell it,

196
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,291
then you'll never have to work
another day in your life!

197
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,791
[STEIN growls]
Let's go! After them!

198
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,750
Someone fetch me a horse!

199
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:31,000
Hey! I said after them!
Are you listening?

200
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,333
[THJALIF]
Hold on.

201
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,958
I think we should let Ving
handle their pursuit.

202
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,875
You should use this
opportunity to rest.

203
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,250
Come now. You can't
be serious, Thjalif!

204
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,250
I'm still capable of fighting!

205
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,625
But it's important to
take care of yourself.

206
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,291
How do you feel?
Do you need to eat?

207
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,958
[STEIN'S stomach grumbling]

208
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,291
[STEIN]
Uh...

209
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,333
I'll have the men prepare
a chariot worthy of you,

210
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,375
and we'll get you some
fresh clothes as well.

211
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,000
Is that your way of
telling me I should be

212
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,666
a little more presentable
in front of the troops?

213
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,666
Well, it's a fair point,
I guess.

214
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,291
Fine, we'll send Ving
to follow their army.

215
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,125
I'll rest up for
the next battle.

216
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,000
[STEIN] I guess Yuuto Suou
is a coward after all.

217
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,458
What did you say?
Ving's dead?

218
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:30,250
Yes, My Lord, I'm afraid he died
in a battle against Scarfior.

219
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:34,375
[STEIN screams]

220
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,916
Uncle Vingerhor is dead

221
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,916
because I suggested he
follow the Wolf Clan's army.

222
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,333
I can't apologize enough.

223
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,750
Why you!

224
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,750
You're right. It's your fault!

225
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,666
[STEIN shouts]

226
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,458
[coughs]

227
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,375
[gasps]

228
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,166
[STEIN]
I'm sorry! Are you okay?

229
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,958
I'm fine. This pain is nothing

230
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,666
compared to the sorrow
you must be feeling

231
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,291
over losing your blood brother.

232
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,416
[THJALIF groans]

233
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,166
Don't push yourself!

234
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,291
Please, don't worry
about me, My Lord.

235
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,416
You must focus on
winning this battle.

236
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,041
The soldiers in our
army are all on edge.

237
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,041
You'll have to lead them
to victory yourself.

238
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,083
Leave it to me.

239
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,083
I'll devour everything
the Wolf Clan has to offer!

240
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,791
[STEIN] Yuuto Suou.
I won't let him get away!

241
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,291
--[grunts]
--[horse whinnying]

242
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,291
Sorry, but I can't
let you go further.

243
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,083
Scarfior!

244
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:55,625
You killed my brother, Ving!
I will have vengeance!

245
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,166
[STEIN]
Now I get it.

246
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,166
Your ability is to parry
others' attacks, huh?

247
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,416
It looks like you
catch on quickly.

248
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,750
Hyah!

249
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,458
[STEIN]
Get back here, you coward!

250
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,708
My army's already
forded the river!

251
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,500
There's no point in me staying!

252
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,708
All right then,
troops, follow me!

253
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,375
Those stupid Wolf Clan weaklings
think they can escape us

254
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,291
just by crossing
some puny river?

255
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,166
Let's show them
just how powerful

256
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,250
the Lightning Clan can be!

257
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:40,333
[SOLDIERS shouting]

258
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:43,458
Okay, looks like their army
is gonna take the bait.

259
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,208
Why are you talking like
we're trying to catch fish?

260
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,666
Well, we are.

261
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,666
At least it's sort of
the same concept,

262
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,500
but instead of fishing,
we're setting a trap

263
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,375
that's big enough to
catch a foolish tiger.

264
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,125
Huh? I'm confused.

265
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,000
So, are tigers
supposed to be yummy?

266
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:02,750
No, not if you eat them while
they're still raw, Albertina.

267
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,208
You obviously have
to cook them first.

268
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,875
Well, look at you, continuing
to defy the laws of nature.

269
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,291
Impressive.

270
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:26,166
Aw, did your coward's legs
get tired of running away?

271
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,333
My legs feel fine.

272
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:28,916
However, My Lord has requested

273
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
that I stop you from
advancing further.

274
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,166
Now, I'm here.

275
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,166
And you believe you
can actually do it?

276
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,875
I don't have any illusions that
I could defeat a monstrous man

277
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,125
such as yourself
without a little help.

278
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:43,458
Hello again. I've come to
return the favor of humiliation.

279
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,083
I'm here because I
couldn't stand back

280
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,208
and let everyone else
have all the fun.

281
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:50,125
You really think
you can take me?

282
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,041
[FELICIA] We also invited
along the Brisingamen.

283
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,958
They're the Horn Clan's
four mighty Einherjar.

284
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,250
[SCARFIOR] That means you're
up against seven Einherjar.

285
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,250
Do you still think
you can defeat us?

286
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,916
[grunts]

287
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,708
Would you like to know what your
biggest weakness is, Steinthor?

288
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:12,166
I'll tell you. You think you're
so superior that you can't lose.

289
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,625
[SOLDIERS groaning]

290
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,791
[SCARFIOR] You left
your entire army behind.

291
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,875
Now, they'll all die!

292
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,750
Damn you!

293
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,000
Curse you all!

00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,291
Tell me something.

298
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,875
Has your tiny tiger
brain figured out

299
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,041
that this whole
fight was a trap?

300
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,583
You've lost!

301
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,875
You're weaklings, all of you!

302
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,875
You'll never defeat me!

303
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,416
[ALL gasp]

304
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,958
Huh?

305
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,750
You trap me?

306
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,875
That's the most hilarious
thing I've ever heard!

307
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,291
There's no way you can bring
a tiger like me down,

308
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:22,666
because no matter what,
I can still take all of you!

309
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,125
Even with all seven of us here,
we still can't beat him?

310
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,916
He might be beyond
our power to defeat.

311
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,541
Hey, give yourselves
a little more credit.

312
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,500
It's not like anybody
else has made a battle

313
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,333
this challenging
for me before.

314
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,708
You should all be proud.

315

[laughing]

316
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,416
Huh?

317
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,958
[SCARFIOR]
I told you at the start of this.

318
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:49,416
My orders were only to keep you
from advancing any further.

319
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,583
The seven of us
were a distraction.

320
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:55,000
This whole fight was just a
ruse to keep you in one spot.

321
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,791
You fought valiantly.

322
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,958
Of course, your fighting skills
don't really amount to much

323
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,708
when all you have is
the bravery of a fool.

324
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,375
Go!

325
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,708
Hey! What the--

326
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,750
Our lord is the ruler
of three great clans

327
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,583
who commands the laws of nature!

328
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:12,291
Maybe if you try hard, you might
be half the man he is one day!

329
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,000
What's that?
Can you hear it yet?

330
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,291
It's the howls of Jormungandr!

331
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,833
[gasps]

332
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,875
[SOLDIERS shouting]

333
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,458
Looks like you were
too busy fighting

334
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:27,166
to notice the rushing water!
Enjoy your complimentary bath!

335
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,166
I don't understand.

336
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,416
It should be impossible.
I can't lose.

337
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,625
[YUUTO]
Hey, you really came through.

338
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,083
Big Brother!

339
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,416
[YUUTO] Block the river so
all the water will build up.

340
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,250
Then break the dam down
at the right moment

341
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,875
as the enemy tries to cross.

342
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,166
I just can't believe
it worked out so well.

343
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,791
I've never heard of
such an amazing

344
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,500
battle strategy before.
You're a genius!

345
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,666
It's the Wei River Stratagem.

346
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,166
Steinthor reminded me of
general I once read about

347
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,333
named Xiang Yu.

348
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:05,791
Another general, Han Xin,

349
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,333
used this tactic to
defeat him in a battle.

350
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,625
Whoa! Big brother,
sometimes I think

351
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,083
you might actually be
the god of war's avatar!

352
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,833
[YUUTO]
Nah, I'm just a big cheater.

353
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,541
You get all the
credit for this one.

354
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,416
Huh? But why me though?

355
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,916
Well, having an
idea is one thing,

356
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,250
but executing it is another.

357
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,500
You brought the
townspeople together.

358
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,833
And it was you that was the one

359
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,041
who organized the
building of the dam.

360
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,375
Without your help, this idea
would have never panned out.

361
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,625
[LINNEA] I doubt even someone
as strong as Steinthor

362
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,458
could survive getting hit
by that rushing water.

363
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,125
This is goodbye to that idiot.

364
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,166
Not that I'm disagreeing
with the idiot part,

365
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,416
but you really didn't
like that man, huh?

366
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,875
No, I didn't.

367
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,375
I don't know if it's
talent he was born with,

368
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,458
or the power of the gods,
or Alfkipfer.

369
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:59,166
Whatever the heck it was,
he didn't earn it himself.

370
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,041
It wasn't the result
of effort or training.

371
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,166
And yet he was still so
arrogant about everything.

372
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,875
He was just cheating.

373
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,958
What do you mean, brother?

374
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,000
I don't get it. I'm sorry.

375
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,500
The reason he made me so angry

376
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:18,083
is because he reminds me of
myself and how I used to be.

377
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,916
[YUUTO]
What an absolute moron.

378
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,166
[grunting]

379
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,541
Oh, crap! That's pretty painful!

380
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,166
[sighs]

381
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,708
I actually lost.

382
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:38,208
And what makes matters worse
is it was to such a weak guy.

383
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,833
[laughs]

384
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,375
[STEIN]
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

385
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,166
I think I might have a
bunch of broken bones.

386
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,791
Well, I guess there's
no real point

387
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,875
in sweating the small stuff.

388
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,583
Hey.

389
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,333
[MITSUKI]
Oh, you're alive?

390
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:00,500
[YUUTO]
Hmph. Yeah, obviously.

391
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,166
[MITSUKI] You went a lot longer
than usual without calling,

392
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,875
so I started to worry you
might actually be dead.

393
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,958
[YUUTO]
Well, there was a lot to do,

394
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:11,125
and even more after
we won the battle.

395
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,500
Like what exactly?

396
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,958
[YUUTO] Uh, the Lightning
Clan's land is ours now,

397
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,541
so I had to figure out
who was going to rule it,

398
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,250
and I had to reward the
men who fought for us.

399
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,291
Then I had to compensate the
families of the fallen and--

400
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,750
Okay, okay, I get it!

401
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,791
[MITSUKI]
When are you coming home?

402
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:36,708
[YUUTO] Honestly, I don't know
how to get back right now.

403
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,250
Oh.

404
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:42,208
But once the Wolf Clan is
more powerful, I can do more.

405
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:45,000
Like, I'll be able to
research and stuff.

406
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,875
I know I'll find
a way back home.

407
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,666
Good. Don't keep
me waiting, okay?

408
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,416
Right. I promise.

409
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:34,333
You did a wonderful
job again this week!

410
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:36,541
Yeah, I don't feel like I got
that much screen time.

411
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,708
I'm starting to feel like
I'm getting less and less, too.

412
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,541
Okat, if I talk about
Big Brother some more,

413
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:41,583
maybe that'll help.

414
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,166
Oh, would it be okay
if I joined you?

415
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,291
Well, I kind of doubt
I could really stop you.

416
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:47,041
[FELICIA chuckles]
