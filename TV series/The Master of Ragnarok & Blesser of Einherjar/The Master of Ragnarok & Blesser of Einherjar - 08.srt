I saw a young man
with short, black hair.

That was Yuuto.

There was a very
peculiar reaction.

The magics of Gleipnir
completely ensnared him.

The reason your hidden magics
affected him in that way

8
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:43,333
is because he was brought here
from another world.

162
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:00,791
Uh, yes! Right away!

163
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,166
And a glass of water as well.

164
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,666
I'm starting to get
a bit thirsty.

165
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,000
Sure!

166
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,750
[CHRISTINA] Effy. My shoulders
are feeling stiff.

167
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,166
--Would you massage them?
--[EPHERIA] Okay!

168
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,083
--[CHRISTINA] And also--
--[ALBERTINA] Oh! I can do it!

169
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:15,166
--[CHRISTINA] You be quiet.
--[YOUNG QUEEN growls]

170
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,041
[CHRISTINA] That classroom is
being ruled by a little queen.

171
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,375
What?

172
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,791
[CHRISTINA] She's the one
that's been telling

173
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,958
all of the other girls
in class to ignore Effy.

174
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,875
But why would someone do that?

175
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,041
This is all your fault, Father!

176
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,333
Why me?

177
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,666
When Effy was enrolled
at that school,

178
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,875
you accompanied her
on the very first day,

179
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,375
and then proceeded to act
especially close with her,

180
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,541
isn't that right?

181
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,291
I guess I gave her
some special treatment,

182
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,458
but that's only
because I figured

183
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,000
it would help her fit in.

184
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,916
You really don't understand
a single thing

185
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,500
about how women think, do you?

186
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,125
It's practically laughable.

187
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,125
[YUUTO]
Wait. What do you mean?

188
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,208
It's a case of female jealousy.

189
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,250
Every girl in that class
obviously wanted you

190
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,375
to pay attention to them
when you showed up.

191
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,291
But you clearly only
cared about Effy,

192
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,916
so of course
they got jealous.

193
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,750
That little queen in particular.

194
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,500
[YUUTO groans]

195
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,208
[sighs]

196
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,416
So, what do we do about it?

197
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,541
[CHRISTINA] Sit back and
watch while I rise to power

198
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,000
and become the new
queen of the classroom.

199
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,708
Okay?

200
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,583
[CHRISTINA] After I
establish myself as such,

201
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,208
I'll be able to bolster Effy's
standing in the class.

202
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,916
As a close companion
of the queen,

203
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,791
no one will be able
to ignore her.

204
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,875
Simple, yet ingenious.

205
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,333
[YUUTO]
Hmm. Now I get it.

206
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,833
Just relax, Father.

207
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,416
Leave it to me.

208
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,583
I'll make sure that everything
goes according to plan.

209
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,833
[TEACHER]
That's all for today's lessons.

210
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:40,666
Hey so, you want to come
over to my house later?

211
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,666
Huh?

212
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,958
[GIRL 2]
Lady Christina,

213
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,041
do you have any
plans for us today?

214
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,583
I do.

215
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,666
I was thinking we could all take
a trip to the bath together.

216
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,958
Father asked me to check out
this particular location

217
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,791
and report back with
my thoughts about it.

218
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,166
I asked him if I
could bring along

219
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,291
some of my friends
from school with me.

220
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:00,208
He said it was no problem,
so you're all welcome to join!

221
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,416
Wow, do you really mean it,
Lady Christina?

222
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,958
[GIRL 1]
Wonderful!

223
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:07,833
We're so lucky to be friends
with someone as generous as you!

224
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,958
Alright then,
let's get going, everybody.

225
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,291

Okay!

226
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,166
Aren't you gonna go with them?

227
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,791
Hey, did you hear what I said?

I don't need any
sympathy from you.

234
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,875
Just go away and leave me alone.

-Listen!

I thought I already told you no!

00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,250
I'd really like you
to come with us!

241
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,958
Did you hear a word I said?

--[EPHERIA] I heard you.
--[gasps]

It's just everyone
has a lot more fun

when all of our
friends are together!

Mm-hm.

[EPHERIA]
Let's go.

247
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,166
I have resolved Effy's issue,
just like I said I would.

248
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,708
That's good to hear!

249
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,208
So, I guess that means your
time as students is over then?

250
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,291
Yes, all over!

251
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:31,833
Huh?

252
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:32,958
Not just yet.

253
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,500
We're going to keep attending.

254
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,916
What?

255
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,458
But I thought you said we
were all done! Not again!

256
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,791
I don't wanna keep
going back to school!

[CHRISTINA]
Come along, Al.

258
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,333
We're going to study nonstop

259
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,000
until you know how
to write your own name.

260
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't like school!
And I hate studying!

261

[MITSUKI]
Merry Christmas!

Merry Christmas, Mitsuki.

263

Although Christmas isn't
exactly a thing here just yet.

[MITSUKI]
Oh, right.

Jesus hasn't been born
where you are, has he?

266
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,083
I guess that means no presents.

267
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,291
Nope, none.

268
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,875
--Uh...
--[MITSUKI] What's up?

269
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,583
Actually, I was
kind of wondering

270
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,375
what sort of presents
I would even give

271

to the people in this world.

272
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:20,333
Things are so different,
I have absolutely no idea.

273
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,125
I think as long
as your heart's in it,

274
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,166
they'd be happy with
any gift you gave them.

275
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,666
[YUUTO]
Yeah I get that,

276
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,375
but I'm trying to think of
something a bit more tangible.

277
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,208
You can make something by hand!

278
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,541
By hand? 

279
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,166
[MITSUKI] That would make
it one of a kind!

00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,333
Big Brother had
planned today.

321
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,625
[YUUTO]
You can take the work from here!

322
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,000
[INGRID] Hey, would you
stop being so pushy!

323
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:55,000
Huh?

324
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,958
[INGRID]
Why are you acting so weird?

325
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,916
Hello! What's up, Run?

326
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,250
Is something the matter?

327
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,750
Oh no, not at all!

328
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,166
We were just heading on
over to the smithy.

329
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,416
But if you need
anything important,

330
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,916
you can talk to Felicia.

331
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,875
[RUN]
I see. I'll accompany you!

332
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,083
[groans]

333
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,791
If you are planning
to sequester yourself,

334
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:13,666
then please allow--

335
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,500
No thanks! That's okay!

336
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,083
It's really not your
responsibility, so don't worry!

337
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,416
But, Father,
I would like to help.

338
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,750
We'll be fine! Just go
along with your day!

339
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,375
Aw.

340
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,625
How bizarre.

341
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,833
I didn't accidentally do
something to upset you,

342
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,833
did I, Father?

343
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,500
[INGRID]
What's got you so on edge today?

344
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,833
[YUUTO] I am not on edge!
You're on edge!

345
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,791
--[CHRISTINA] Oh, hello, Father.
--[YUUTO groans]

346
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,875
And a good day to
Miss Ingrid, as well.

347
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,625
Are you two on your
way to the smithy?

348
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,041
That sounds fun!

349
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,000
Can I come?

350
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,291
I wanna try making something

351
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,333
at the smithy
with you, Father!

352
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,416
[CHRISTINA]
What you're asking for

353
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,833
is simply impossible,
my dear sister.

354
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,583
That place is the source of
the Wolf Clan's prosperity.

355
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,000
You could even say that
it's the clan's heart.

356
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,833
Not even I was
allowed to enter,

357
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,708
so you certainly
won't be, Al.

358
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,625
[YUUTO]
You mean you tried?

359
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,166
[INGRID]
Well, these things are weird.

360
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,583
Where'd you get the idea
to make these yourself?

361
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,541
I was thinking about
giving Felicia and Run

362
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,291
handmade presents
for their birthdays.

363
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,875
[INGRID grunts]

364
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,708
They're coming up soon, so I'd
have to get them done quickly.

365
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,333
Is that so?

366
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,208
You mean you're having
me spend my day off

367
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,041
making presents
for other people?

368
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,375
Uh, I just wanted to
do something nice.

369
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,583
That's all.

370
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,125
Those two have
helped me out a lot,

371
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,000
so I thought maybe-

372
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,958
[INGRID screams]

373
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,833
I can't believe I'm going
to be stuck in here

374
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:28,916
helping this moron

375
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,416
make birthday presents
for other women.

376
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,250
And on my only day off too.

--[YUUTO] Wanna talk about it?
--Just work!

[INGRID grunting]

379
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,708
You think maybe you
could take a second

380
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,333
and try to not be
so angry at me.

381
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,958
And how do you expect
me to do that?

382
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,833
I don't know, some deep breaths?

383
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:49,041
Please, I'm begging you.
Let's try to get along.

384
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,666
It is just the two
of us, after all.

385
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,125
Just the two of us, huh?

386
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,125
[INGRID]
I rarely get a chance like this!

387
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,166
[YUUTO chuckles]

388
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,416
[INGRID]
It's the perfect opportunity

389
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,583
to make this idiot finally
see me as a woman!

390

[YUUTO blowing air gently]

00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,458
Try again!

392
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:11,375
And again!

Give it here, and I'll show
you how it's done.

--[INGRID] Like that.
--Uh, thanks.

Okay, now start turning it.

--[YUUTO] Like this?
--That's wrong!

Jeez. Try doing it
more like this.

00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,333
Good, that's much better.

400
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,625
So then, what do you think?

401
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:39,958
This is hard.

402
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,458
But I'll keep trying.

403
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,500
Really? Does he not notice

I'm trying to seduce
him right now?

[INGRID]
No, you're still doing it wrong!

You have to spin it more!
Ugh, I'll just do it myself!

[ALBERTINA]
I wanna see!

408
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,041
I wanna go inside!

409
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,208
Jumping and whining like
that won't get you anywhere.

410
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,666
So relax.

411
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,875
Of course, I'd like to see
what's going on inside too,

412
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,291
but I'm not complaining.

413
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,625
We just have to accept
that getting in

414
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,208
is impossible and move on.

415
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,916
So what do you think they're
making in there anyway?

416
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,750
Maybe they're working on some
sort of new advanced technology.

417
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,083
Something even better
than metal or glass!

418
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,958
Now look at what
you've done, Al!

Who, me? But I
didn't do anything!

You got me all excited.

00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,958
And now I just can't
stand not knowing

what's behind those walls.

while I'm trying
to find a way inside,

please tell our father
that I died with honor!

And that I did it for
the glory of our country!

No! You can't die on me, Chris!

Yeah, of course they did,

considering I did
all of the work.

You're right about that.

So, I can't really say

and you also picked the colors.

I can tell that you put
your heart into these.

You think so?

479
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:25,625
Now get this place
cleaned up!

480
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,833
Man, that hurt.

481
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,541
She didn't have to hit me.

482
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,708
Hmm?

483
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,125
Oh!

484
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,208
Good morning!
How are you doing?

485
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,375
It sure is cold today, huh?

486
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,916
Wait, hold on a sec!

487
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,916
Hey, would you slow down?

488
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,958
What do you want?

489
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,041
This is called a magatama.

490
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,583
And I made it just
for you, Ingrid.

491
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,875
Look, I didn't mean to
make you angry yesterday.

492
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,708
But I thought I would
try to make it up to you

493
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,666
by giving you
something pretty.

494
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,958
Not that you need it.

495
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,000
Because I think you're
plenty pretty already.

496
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,333
[gasps]

497
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,708
A cheap, little trinket
like this

498
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,375
really wouldn't
do you any favors.

499
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,833
So, you don't have to
accept it if don't want to.

500
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,833
[INGRID chuckles]

501
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,375
What do you think?

502
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,541
Looks great.
It really suits you.

503
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,291
I think you'll turn
quite a few heads.

504
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,125
I've never been much
of an attention seeker,

505
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,458
so I don't wanna start now.

506
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,708
Come on.

507
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,541
You don't really
mean that do you?

508
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,541
Are you actually okay with
spending your whole life

509
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:41,500
stuck in a forge?

510
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,708
It's fine by me!

511
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,916
I've already gotten what I want.

512
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,708
Thanks for this, Yuuto.

513
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,750
I think it'll help
my motivation.

514
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,000
Good to hear.

515
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:53,750

[YUUTO]
Work hard, okay?

517
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,125
[LOPTR]
Enlighten me.

518
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,208
What exactly sparked

519
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,291
the Empire's interest
in all of this?

520
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,708
It is the duty of the Empire

521
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,916
to ensure that order is
maintained all across the land.

522
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,250
And it seems the Wolf Clan

523
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,625
has been disrupting
that order as of late.

524
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,208
What's your point?

525
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,500
There are no current
ties between

526
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,000
the Lightning
and Panther clans.

527
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,541
And yet you're proposing
an Oath of the Chalice?

528
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,333
Let's say that we do
take this oath.

529
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:31,208
Would I be the younger,
or the elder?

530
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,375
[ALEXIS] You must consider
the Lightning Clan's position

531
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,625
in this as well.

532
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,416
Why not brothers
of equal standing?

533
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,375
Equal standing?

534
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,208
I accept.

535
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,916
I'm not interested in
any more younger brothers.

536
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,708
That's very good to hear.

537
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,041
Then shall I proceed
with the plan?

538
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,041
You shall.

539
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:52,291
Best of luck to you,
Lord Alexis.

540
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,666
[ALEXIS]
Of course.

541
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,166
Let us make the young
Patriarch of the Wolf Clan

542
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,958
disappear from
this world forever.

543
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:33,625
There were quite a few kids

544
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,125
in this episode,
don't you think?

545
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,875
I just hope some of them
are interested in smithing.

546
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,375
Or I can make
Al my apprentice.

547
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,333
--Why would you?
--She's cute and obedient.

548
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,125
--She'd make a great smith.
--[CHRISTINA groans]

549
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,458
Maybe I should start training
her as soon as possible!

550
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:46,958
You and I need to
have a little chat.
