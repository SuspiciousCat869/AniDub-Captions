Can't you hit me?

The scrawny wolf is back!
Took you long enough!

00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:33,541
Why don't you join your
men and run like a dog?

Well, at least things are
finally getting interesting.

00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:49,000
Your skill is deflecting
my attacks, right?

Did I hit a nerve, she-wolf?

[THJALFI] Father! The Panther
Clan is preparing

34
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,541
to attack the Wolf
Clan's main army, sir!

35
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:58,500
They are?!

36
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,958
Really? Well, that was fast.

37
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,416
I guess I can't
let my guard down

38
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,250
around my masked brother
for even a moment.

39
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,000
We should join him
as soon as we can.

--I won't let you!
--Huh?

41
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,708
Come on. You can't be
serious right now.

42
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,333
Haven't I embarrassed
you enough?

43

Unless you want to end up
like your fallen friend,

44
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,208
then you had better
get out of my way.

[SOLDIER 2]
What's going on?

49
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,833
This is bad. Ten thousand
cavalrymen can only mean...

50
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,500
That we're going up
against the Panther Clan.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,208
They've got us between a
rock and a hard place.

52
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:46,458
[FELICIA] Big Brother,
it might be best if we retreat.

53
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,750
[FELICIA] There are some
battles that cannot be won.

54
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,166
You are a brilliant leader,

55
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,750
but even you can't be
victorious every single time.

56
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:57,125
We should just withdraw for the
time being and try to regroup.

57
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,250
I agree.

58
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,375
With both the Lightning Clan

59
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,000
and the Panther Clan
pursuing us,

60
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,291
then a retreat would be best.

61
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,083
That can't be the only option.

62
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:08,166
I know it's a difficult choice
to make, but even so...

63
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,208
[YUUTO]
If we run away now,

64
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,416
then the enemy
will swarm after us.

65
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,958
They'll chase us back
into our own territory,

66
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,875
and our lands will suffer
greatly as a result.

67
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,916
Our men will be killed,

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,166
and our women and children
will be sold as slaves.

69
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,666
[YUUTO]
The Wolf Clan is my family.

70
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,958
Everyone in it looks up to me
as a brother or a father.

71
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:49,000
[YUUTO] Sometimes you need
to be cruel, be calculating.

72
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,208
[YUUTO]
At least, that's what the cheats

73
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:55,041
I've relied on this
entire time have told me.

74
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,000
But... I won't!

75
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:03,500
I won't just abandon my family
like some kind of lowly coward!

76
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,500
Of course, you won't.

77
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,083
For this battle, I'm using

78
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,958
a cheap little technique
you're so famous for, Yuuto.

79
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:20,583
I suspected from the beginning
that you'd set a trap like this.

80
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,250
It appears that I'm
several steps ahead

81
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,958
of whatever game you're playing.

82
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,625
Attention, Soldiers of
the Panther Clan!

83
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:31,000
It's time to avenge
our past humiliation!

84
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:34,708
This is our moment!
Prepare to engage!

85
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,416
All units, attack now!

87
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:45,333
What now, Father? How do
you want us to proceed?

88
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,791
I'm not sure.

89
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,833
Do you want me to
call Run back to us?

90
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,166
Unfortunately, I don't think

91
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,833
calling Run back
is going to help.

92
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:56,750
There has to be another plan
I haven't thought of yet.

93
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,208
How frustrating!

94
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,333
If only I had the kind
of power Steinthor did,

95
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,833
things would be different!

96
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,291
Big Brother?

97
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,208
Did you think of something
new that will help us?

98
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,708
Yeah. Well, new for me.

[SOLDIER B groans]
It's over.

106
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,583
We can't win against
an army that big!

107
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,708
Maybe we should
give up. Retreat.

[SOLDIER G] The patriarch!
It's the patriarch!

115

Hold your ground,
Champions of the Wolf Clan!

116

Take up your spears
and get into formation!

quickly!

It's the patriarch!

122

Lord Yuuto will surely
lead us to victory!

123
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,291
Are you truly going to
the front lines, Big Brother?

124
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:02,166
I am. The Lightning Clan
always has the highest morale.

125
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,958
That's because Steinthor
is right there

126
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,250
at the front with them.

127
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,291
[CHRISTINA]
I think I get it.

128
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,916
You've never been
on the front before,

129
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,625
so if you go now, you'll be
able to inspire our soldiers.

130
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,041
You want to boost their morale
the way Steinthor does.

131
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,583
That's right, and I know

132
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,083
that it's a dangerous
move for me to make.

133
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,333
But because our
situation is so dire,

134
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,666
it's more important than
ever to unite our army.

Behold the Patriarch
of the Wolf Clan!

140
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,541
There is Yuuto Suou!
He is your target!

141
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,208
I order you to go forth
and capture him!

142

I promise to reward any man
who brings him to me!

Please put your faith in me!

Did you see Lord Yuuto just now?

148
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,708
[SOLDIER B]
The Patriarch is so brave!

149
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:06,875
Hail Lord Yuuto!

150
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,125
With Lord Yuuto as our leader,

151
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,125
the Wolf Clan is stronger
than ever before!

152
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:15,250
[SOLDIER C] He brought peace
and prosperity back to our land.

153

[SOLDIER D]
Because of him,

154
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,916
my family has bread
to eat every day.

155
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,125
[SOLDIER E]
He even sent my son to school.

156
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,833
I believe in him.

157
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,625
I have complete
faith in Lord Yuuto,

158

[SOLDIERS yell]

163

Our Patriarch was right
about this battle!

164
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,750
Come on! We can
still be victorious!

165
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,500
We won't let you scoundrels
lay a hand on Lord Yuuto!

166
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,875
Protect the patriarch
at all costs!

167
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,583
Don't let 'em hurt the
Wolf Clan's savior!

168

[LOPTR grumbles]
This can't be!

How are our forces
being pushed back?

170
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:06,208
Way to go! This was a
splendid idea, Big Brother!

171
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,875
Considering that
I'm no Steinthor,

172
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,708
I'm honestly surprised that
it boosted their morale so much.

173
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,500
Don't say that!

174

From the soldiers here
on this battlefield

175

you are the Wolf Clan's savior!

What's the matter?
Does the she-wolf need a break?

don't need to rest?

183
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,333
Damn you!

184
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,166
[SOLDIER A]
We're gonna be okay!

[SOLDIER B]
The Patriarch is here!

186

[SOLDIER C]
Lord Yuuto!

187
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:58,583
No way! Is it possible Father
is truly on the front lines?

188
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,291
[STEIN laughs]

189
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,333
Oh, my! You don't say?

190
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,875
Yuuto Suou never
ceases to amaze me.

191
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,958
Things are finally starting
to get interesting!

192
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:15,458
All these years, I had no idea
men like him even existed.

193
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,500
My father...

194
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,583
My father is...

195
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,666
[STEIN] Heh! It's been fun,
but I think I'll see

196
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,958
what your precious
patriarch is up to.

197
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:35,375
[RUN] Hey, I told you earlier
that I'm not letting you leave.

198
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,375
[STEIN scoffs]
Let's not be ridiculous.

199
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,875
It's not like you'll ever
be able to defeat me.

200
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,708
I have more important
matters to attend to.

201
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:46,500
Business with Yuuto Suou!
And this time, I'll win.

202
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,916
He may be the worthiest
adversary I've ever faced,

203
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,375
but still...

204
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,250
This time I have no intention
of losing to that man!

205
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:56,750
[RUN] Well, I have no intention
of losing to you, Steinthor!

206
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,125
Huh?

207
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,708
[RUN] It's a new technique,
and I'm still practicing it.

208
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,166
But now...

209
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,958
Huh?

210
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,166
[RUN]
It's my last chance.

211
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,500
[STEIN]
That's a new stance.

212
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,416
[RUN] Yes, it's a move
that Father taught me.

213
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,125
[STEIN] Oh? Sounds like it might
actually be interesting, then.

214
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,125
Let's go.

215
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:28,125
Heh! I'll give you a chance,
but I'm done going easy on you!

[STEIN laughs]

218
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,958
Some technique!
How disappointing.

219
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,875
Right then, it's time
to say goodbye!

220

Nice move, she-wolf.

[SOLDIER A] The Muspell Squad
has captured Fort Gashina!

We've won!

00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,541
[SOLDIER B] Reinforcements!
The Muspell Squad is here!

225
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,125
So, we made it through?

226
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,333
[SOLDIERS cheers]

227
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,500
Big Brother!

228
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,625
Looks like the squad
finally made it!

229
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,375
The truth is I never
intended to engage you

230
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,625
in straight-forward
battle, Steinthor.

231
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,416
Not this time.
You see, my goal was always

232
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,166
to cut off the path
to your supply lines

233
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,625
as well as your escape route.

234
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:42,833
Though I do have to say,

235
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,250
I didn't think you'd
actually get this close

236
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,750
to defeating our troops.

237
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,541
Let's go! The counterattack
begins now!

238

[STEIN] Every time I meet
him on the battlefield,

241
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:06,333
he comes up with some new
trick or plan to outsmart me.

242
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:09,541
I'm starting to think
that man might be a magician.

243
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,166
Well, as much as
I hate to admit this,

244
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,916
it'd probably be a good idea
for me to take my leave.

245
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,166
Hey, just so you know,
that attack really hurt.

246
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,875
Of course it did.
You can thank my father.

247
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,833
He's the one who taught
me how to do that.

00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:30,583
[STEIN]
Tell me, what's your name?

249

The Managarmr of the Wolf Clan.
I'm Siegrune.

250
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:39,291
Siegrune's a pretty good name.
I'll remember that.

251
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:45,458
Okay, men, temporary retreat.
Go on ahead. I'll hold them off!

252
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,416
Father, no! We would
never leave without you!

253
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,083
Yeah, that's right! If anything,
we'll hold off the enemy

254
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,166
while you escape to safety!

255
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:58,250
No way. I'm not leaving a
single one of you behind, men.

256
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,666
Steinthor, get back here!

Please give your predecessor
my regards, Siegrune.

Impossible.

Even after we joined our forces
with the Lightning Clan,

270
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,166
we're still losing this war?

271

Not only did he steal
my position as patriarch,

272
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,250
but he's a better general, too?

273
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:06,541
Sigyn, I command you to
open up a pathway to Yuuto.

[YUUTO] This is good.
We managed to fend them off.

Right, Felicia?

00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,875
He's coming. See?

They're not stopping him?

279
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,458
If I had to guess, it's probably

280
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,125
because of Sigyn
and her spellsong.

Do you really think so?

Yes.

283

You bet I have!

Because I haven't been
skipping my fighting lessons!

I'm not the worthless
kid I used to be.

I'm sick of always having
to be protected.

316
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,083
Time to die!

317
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,666
You first!

318
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,500
You're done!

[BOTH grunting]

00:19:49,958 --> 00:20:04,000
Damn you, Yuuto.

00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,416
Loptr.

322
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,000
Are you okay?

[SIGYN sings]

324
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,291
It's her!

325
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,250
Another spell?

326
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,083
Yes, one that even I could feel.

327
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,041
I'm sure that's
Sigyn's spellsong.

328
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,958
But why?

329
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:22,000
[SIGYN]
The bonds of the holy pact...

330
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:27,166
...made by God begin to weaken,

331
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:32,500
and the chained,
starving wolf will be unleashed.

[FELICIA] Big Brother,
your body's disappearing!

--[YUUTO] Felicia!
--What's happening?

Take this!

00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,041
Why?

337
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:56,000
[gasps] No! Please,
don't leave us, Big Brother!

338
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,000
I beg you!

339
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,416
Listen, I don't
want this either!

340
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,333
What are we going to do?

341
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,125
I'm sorry.

342

[sobs]
Don't leave me. Big Brother!

--[SOLDIER A] Father!
--[SOLDIER B] This way!

[FELICIA]
What should we do?

345
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,791
[MITSUKI]
Huh?

346
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,750
Uh?

Uh, Mitsuki?

351
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,208
Felicia, where's Father at?

352
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,333
Uh, Run, I don't know
how to tell you this...

353
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,875
Wait. Has he already
gone to sleep?

354
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,375
That's not exactly
where he went.

355
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,583
Well, he must be exhausted
after that last battle.

356
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,541
I'll just go see
if he needs anything!

357
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:47,000
Poor Run! I don't know how
to tell her what happened.
