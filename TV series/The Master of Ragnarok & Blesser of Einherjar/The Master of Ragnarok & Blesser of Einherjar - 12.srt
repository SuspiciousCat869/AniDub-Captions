Am I in Mitsuki's room?

[gasps] You're back!

00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,833
Oh, my god!

6
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:35,250
Is that really you, Mitsuki?

7
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,916
It's me.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Is this some kind of dream,
or are you here for real?

9
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,166
Yeah! No dream. I'm really here!

10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,916
I can't believe it.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,541
After all this time,
you're back!

[MITSUKI cries]

13
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,208
I'd almost stopped hoping.

14
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,458
I missed you!

15
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,666
Me, too, Mitsuki.

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,166
I missed you, too.

17
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,333
So was this supposed
to be a surprise?

18
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:41,208
[YUUTO]
Huh?

19
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,750
You should've called and told me

20
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,208
you were planning on
returning home today.

21
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,416
Instead you mentioned
that you were going to war,

22
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,041
which had me worried about you.

23
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,375
[YUUTO gasps] Mitsuki, I need
to see your phone right now!

24
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,375
I don't understand.
Is there something wrong?

--Quickly!
--Yuuto!

26
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,250
Okay.

27
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,125
Who are you trying to call?

28
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,458
--My own phone.
--Huh?

29
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:03,875
[OPERATOR 12A]
The number you have dialed

30
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,833
is no longer in service.
Please hang up and try again.

31
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,000
I should've known better
than to expect it to work.

32
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,958
Is everything okay?

33
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,916
Are you worried about what's
going on back in Yggdrasil?

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,875
Yeah...

35
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,833
But thankfully, the Lightning
Clan was driven off,

36
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,833
which forced the
Panther Clan to retreat.

37
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,458
That's good to hear.

38
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,750
[YUUTO]
Huh?

39
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,458
[MITSUKI] You look more
grown up and handsome

40
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,916
since the last time I saw you,

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,250
but you're still the
same boy I remember.

42
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,125
You look cooler than in
your pictures, though.

43
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,333
You think so, huh?

44
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,416
It's good to have you
back home, Yuuto.

45
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,958
Yeah, it is. Thank you.

46
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,041
I can't believe I'm
able to see you again.

47
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,958
It almost doesn't feel real.

48
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,083
It's like a dream that I can

49
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,083
reach out and touch
you like this!

50
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,541
[YUUTO]
I feel the same way.

51

[LOPTR]
Is it true? Are you sure?

53
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:02,458
Yes, he's gone from this world.
I am absolutely certain of it.

[bottle shatters]

56
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,875
I thought I made it
quite clear to you

57
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,375
that I would kill him
with my own hands!

58
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,958
Indeed, you did.

59
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:14,416
It was never my intention
to interfere with your plans.

60
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,875
But you are not merely the
leader of the Panther Clan.

61
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,958
You are also my husband.

62
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:22,416
That is why I cannot allow
anything to happen to you.

63
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,791
Fine.

64
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:30,541
[LOPTR] It is time to enact
my revenge on the Wolf Clan.

65
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:31,875
[STEIN]
What did you say?

66
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,250
Are you telling me Yuuto
Suou disappeared? [groans]

67
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,375
I am unclear as to
the exact details,

68
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,416
but yes, he appears to
have vanished entirely.

69
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,083
The Panther Clan
soldiers are saying

70
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,708
that there is nothing left
to fear of the Wolf Clan,

71
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,583
now that their great leader
has seemingly gone missing.

72
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,583
Did my masked brother
have him killed?

73
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,875
I hope not, but honestly,
it wouldn't surprise me.

74
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,166
It is likely the Panther Clan
will prepare an attack

75
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,750
against Fort Gashina.

76
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,125
What will you do?

77
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,625
[STEIN] I intend to join
the fight, of course.

78
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,291
It belonged to us to
begin with, after all.

79
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,416
Though, to be honest,
without Yuuto Suou around...

80
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,666
...I am much less enthusiastic
about this battle.

Shh. Keep your voice down,

84

or the soldiers outside
might hear you.

[gasps] I apologize.

86
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:27,125
But this is a serious matter
that we must address at once.

87
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,583
Tell me what happened.

88
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,125
He went back there...

89
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,750
[FELICIA]
To his own world.

90
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,875
The secret magics that
were binding him here

91
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:42,000
have been released by
Sigyn of the Panther Clan.

92

No, you cannot mean...

anything you can do?

94
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,666
Any way for you to
summon him back?

95
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:53,958
[FELICIA]
I am afraid I cannot,

96
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,458
since we do not
possess the mirror.

97
00:05:56,541 --> 00:06:00,375
Besides, when I consider what
it was that he truly wanted...

98
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,166
We've got trouble!
Big, big trouble!

barge into my room.

But there's word the
Panther and Lightning Clans

101
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,000
have started mobilizing.

It's kind of hard to
believe I'm really home.

104
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,791
And now we need to get you all
new kinds of clothing to wear,

105
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,291
since you've grown so much.

106
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,791
Yeah, I couldn't believe
this was the only outfit

107
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,833
left in the house that
would still fit me. Huh?

108
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:30,375
[MITSUKI] Hey, Yuuto, over here!
Come check this out.

109

This would look great on you!

[YUUTO]
Too much!

111

I like it, but I'd rather get
something a little bit cheaper.

112
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,416
What? That's no way for
the Wolf Clan Patriarch

113
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,833
to be talking.

114

If you're not careful,
your men will lose faith in you!

115

I'm nothing but an
unemployed teenager here.

116

Yeah, whatever.

But they're all black.

something a bit brighter?

121

I'll let you choose then.

122
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:05,250
Man, I'm exhausted!
My body is so tired,

123
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,250
I could drop dead from
fatigue right here.

Don't be dramatic.

125
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,250
All we did was go shopping
and pick out some clothes.

126
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,541
That was more than "some"!

127

I'll have you know, we spent
at least an entire hour

is supposed to take.

were making great time.

a little pricey, too.

160
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,291
Oh, you've made
a decision already?

161
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,666
No, I decided I'll
have you choose for me!

162
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,333
What?

163
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,916
[MITSUKI]
You heard what I said.

164
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,250
I want you to choose
something for me.

165
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,708
But if I'm the one
picking something,

166
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,083
it might not look good on you.

167
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,666
That's okay. I'll treasure
anything you give me,

168
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,458
even if it's a ridiculous
comb-over wig for parties!

169
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,958
You're serious?

170
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,166
Are you sure you'd be okay
with something weird like that?

171
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,916
[MITSUKI]
I'd make it a family heirloom!

172
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,541
A personal gift bestowed upon me

173
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,791
by the Patriarch of
the Wolf Clan himself!

174
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,250
An artifact.

175
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,458
Uh...

176
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:03,958
All right, if you're sure.

177
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,625
[MITSUKI giggles]

178
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,291
At least tell me what you'd
prefer for me to get you.

179
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,583
Well then, if you insist,
I'd like a hair accessory!

180
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,541
That way I can always wear it
and keep it close to me.

181
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:19,791
Oh, you don't want clothes?
Well, that's fine, too.

182
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,833
Are you planning to
fight in this state?

183
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,083
Your wounds aren't
even fully healed yet.

184
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,666
I don't have a choice.

185
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,916
The Panther and Lightning clans

186
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
are closing in
and nearly upon us.

187
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,708
But since Big Brother
has vanished

188
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,375
and returned to his world,

189
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,250
we cannot afford
to lose you as well.

190
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,333
Otherwise, the Wolf Army will...

191
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,208
That's why I have to go.

192
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,958
If I'm absent from
the front lines,

193
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,333
morale will surely falter.

194
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,458
It's the Managarmr's
job to take their place

195
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,125
at the forefront of battle.

196
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,500
I shall honor this sacred duty.

197
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,916
All right, then.

198
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,375
Big Brother is the only person
you ever did listen to.

199
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,083
I was hoping to
hear his last words,

200
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,833
but unfortunately, I suppose
this will have to suffice.

201
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,833
Tell him that Siegrune fought
bravely until the end.

202
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,916
That I honored him and
all the great things he did

203
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,208
while he lived among us.

204
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,708
[horse neighs]

205
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,875
Please be careful.

206
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,875
[LEAFA] I see. So that
is what occurred then.

207
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,750
Sigyn, the Witch of
Mithgarthor, is powerful.

208
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,041
She is of the three strongest
magic users in all Yggdrasil

209
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,666
and not someone
to be taken lightly.

210
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,500
[LEAFA] It appears that the
only person in all of Yggdrasil

211
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,875
who could possibly break
through her secret magic

212
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,250
and summon Yuuto
back would be me.

213
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,500
[gasps] Then you mean to--

214
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:43,250
Yes, I will summon Yuuto
back to Yggdrasil.

215
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,750
[BOTH laughing]

216
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,791
[LEAFA] Though it entirely
depends on his desire to return.

217
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,000
It seems to be true
that both the Lightning

218
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,708
and Panther Clans
have come back.

219
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,208
What can you tell me
about Big Brother?

220
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,583
Is he safe?

221
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,458
[RASMUS]
Unfortunately...

222
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,500
...I'm told that in
the last battle,

223
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,166
Lord Yuuto perished.

224
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,541
[gasps] That is a
shameless falsehood!

225
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,791
Big Brother materialized
from heaven itself!

226
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,875
I refuse to believe
he could be dead!

227
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,125
I'm terribly sorry, Princess,

228
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,791
but it truly is the
only possibility.

[RASMUS gasps]

230

No, it's a lie! You're wrong!

There's no way
that could be true!

Please, you must try
to collect yourself

233
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,958
and remember that you are still
our patriarch, Princess!

234
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:30,000
Let us use this opportune
moment to our advantage.

235
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,000
We can seize control
of the Wolf Clan.

236
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,041
How dare you suggest
that we repay kindness

237
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,791
with such treachery?
I would never!

But, Princess--

No man as strong
as my Big Brother

Never!

your appetite.

mom make all of this?

That's a good guess,
but it was all me.

eat an entire mud pie.

let me feed you by hand,

00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,958
Can you hear me?

318
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,833
[YUUTO]
Loud and clear.

319
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,250
Are you okay?

320
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,291
I'm fine. I'm just so glad
to know that you're safe.

321
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,583
I can't begin to tell you
how much of a relief it is

322
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,416
to hear your voice again!

323
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,666
I'm doing just fine, I promise.

324
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,166
Huh? Are you still there?

325
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,291
I offer you my deepest
apologies, Big Brother.

326
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,500
We have utterly failed
to protect our stronghold

327
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:05,500
at Fort Gashina.

328

[gasps]

329
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,416
[FELICIA] We lost to the
Panther and Lightning Clans

330
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,541
and barely managed to
escape to Iarnvithor

331
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,291
with our lives intact.

[YUUTO gasps]

333
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:15,875
You said you were
all right, though.

334
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,291
Is Run there, too?

335
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,750
She's here.

336
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,500
I'll let you talk
to her if you'd like.

337
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,333
[RUN]
Father, I...

338
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,458
[gasps] Run,
are you hurt at all?

339
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,791
[RUN] Yes, but it's
a minor injury.

340
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,833
I must apologize to you as well.

341
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,083
Not only did I
lose Fort Gashina,

342
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,333
but I failed to
protect our soldiers.

343
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,166
I lost many of our men.

344
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,666
I don't want you
blaming yourself, okay?

345
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,416
It's my fault for suddenly
disappearing on you like that.

346
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,083
You did well just to endure.

347
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,750
Run, can you put
Felicia back on?

348
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,416
--[FELICIA] Yes?
--[YUUTO] Felicia, tell me.

349
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,166
If I were to ask you to try...

350
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,250
...do you think it's
even remotely possible

351
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,083
for you to summon me
back to Yggdrasil

352
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,041
like you did before?

353
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,958
I believe Leafa could
summon you here.

354
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,041
But, Big Brother...

355
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,958
Yes, what?

356
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,500
[FELICIA] No matter what
the consequences may be,

357
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,208
I will honor any
decision you make.

358
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,041
If you should choose
not to return to us,

359
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,833
know that I'll understand
and I will respect that.

360
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,500
Are you sure that you're
really okay with that?

361
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,833
I hope you never forget
that whatever else I may be,

362
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:27,458
I am always your little sister,
first and foremost.

363
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,875
And it's a little sister's job

364
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,583
to wish for her
big brother's happiness,

365
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,166
don't you agree?

[gasps]

367
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,791
I understand. Thank you
for everything, Felicia.

368
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,041
Of course.

[FELICIA gasps]

370
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,916
What are you doing?
What's this for?

371
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,500
I know you were trying your best
to act cheerful for Father.

372
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,375
Now that it's over,
you may cry on my shoulder.

373
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,083
You have my thanks.

[FELICIA, ALBERTINA crying]

375
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,166
So many crazy things
have happened

376
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,291
and they all started right here.

378

00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,375
Thanks for coming.

380
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,875
I'm sorry I called you
out here so late at night.

381
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,125
It's nothing.

382
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,333
What's gotten into you
all of a sudden, anyway?

383
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,875
Listen, Yuuto, you wanna
go back to Yggdrasil

384
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,625
to help the Wolf Clan,
don't you?

385
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,875
[YUUTO gasps]

386
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,083
I thought so.

387
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,666
How did you know?

388
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,666
Like I said, it's pointless
to try to hide stuff

389
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,875
when I can read you
like an open book.

390
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,291
Why do you look like you're
about to start crying?

391
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:08,000
I know if I do go back there,
you'll worry about me,

392
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,750
and I don't wanna put you
through that ever again.

393
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:11,958
Never mind me.

Focus on what you
want to do, 'kay?

395
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,083
But, Mitsuki...

396
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,500
[MITSUKI]
There's just one catch.

397
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,458
In exchange, I'm going to
do what I want to do, too!

398
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,833
I'm going to go to Yggdrasil
with you this time!

399
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:29,000
Sure, we can
go together! Huh?!

400
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,333
We can! If you let
me come with you,

401
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,375
you won't have a single
reason to worry about me,

402
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,583
because I'll be right by
your side the whole time.

403
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:36,916
You see, this way,

404
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,333
you'll be able to help the
people of the Wolf Clan

405
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,666
and be with me, too!

406
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,041
There's no way I could do that!

407

Are you kidding me?

408
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,833
And why not?

409
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,916
If you can be summoned back,

410
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,666
then it should be possible for
me to go with you this time.

I'm not talking about
if it's possible or not!

Mitsuki, do you have any
idea what you're asking?

413
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,041
You might not ever be able
to return to this world--

414

to come back home!

I know that!

Why else do you
think I wanna go?

417
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,958
I don't want to sit
around waiting anymore.

418
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,333
So we'll do it, right?

419
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,000
[YUUTO groans]
Of course we won't!

420
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,625
You've still got your
family living here!

421
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:12,166
What about Ruri and
your other friends?

422
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,750
It's possible you might
never see them again.

423
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,291
I'm aware of that.

424
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,375
It's sad to think when we leave,

425
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,083
I'll probably be saying
goodbye to them forever.

426
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,750
Then stay here.

427
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,708
But that's nothing compared
to what I went through

428
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,833
not being able to see you!

429
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,750
It was unbearably painful.

430
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,500
I don't want to be apart
from you ever again.

431
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,708
Because, well, I...

I love you more than
anything or anyone, Yuuto!

Please take a second to
give it a bit more thought.

434

This choice could
change your entire life.

435
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:46,833
I have thought about it!

436
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,250
I've thought about it
more than you'll know.

437
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,250
But no matter how much
time I spent thinking,

438
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:54,625
I couldn't contemplate a future
where I was happy without you.

439
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,000
There's no electricity
or running water.

440

There's not even gas
or anything else!

441
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,500
I'll have you and
that's all that matters!

442

You'll have to do
a whole lot of things

you wouldn't normally have
to in the modern world.

Father, up here! Look up!
We're over here! [yells]

474
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,500
You should be more
careful, Big Sis Al.

475
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,541
You wouldn't want to
risk falling, would you?

476
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,708
I can't believe the
size of this crowd!

477
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:42,750
So many people came

478
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:44,333
and they're all
cheering for Master!

479
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:45,500
It's not just here.

480
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,291
Everyone in the Horn Clan
looks up to him.

481
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,708
I'm sure that they would
cheer just as loudly.

482
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:52,125
I never thought he would
grow up like that.

483
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,708
[gasps]

484
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:02,250
So you're the Mitsuki
everyone talks about.

485
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:05,041
[MITSUKI] Well, um, yes,
I'm Mitsuki Shimoya.

486
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:07,000
It's a pleasure to meet you.

487
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm very envious of you.

488
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,166
I hear you're the girl

489
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,458
Lord Yuuto is
desperately in love with.

490
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,791
Well, we have known each other
for a long time, so...

491
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,958
I'm pleased to make
your acquaintance.

492
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,416
Call me Leafa!

493
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,291
[MITSUKI]
Okay!

494
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,666
I owe you my deepest
thanks, Felicia.

495
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,083
[FELICIA gasps]

496
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,916
Truly. Thank you so much

497
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,500
for bringing Father
to our world.

498
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:31,958
I can't imagine a greater honor

499
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:34,375
than swearing an oath
to someone like him.

500
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,708
[CROWD cheering]

501
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,625
[FELICIA]
Welcome home, Big Brother!

502
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,375
We're glad you're back!
