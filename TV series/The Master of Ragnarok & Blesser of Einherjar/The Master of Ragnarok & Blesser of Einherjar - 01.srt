Those who are weak are often
oppressed and trampled upon.

Somehow in this world where I
didn't even speak the language,

49
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,750
I managed to rise to
a position of power

as the Patriarch
of the Wolf Clan.

Well, seeing as you are
kind of like our king,

are you trying to suggest

68
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,041
that perhaps you'd like
to eventually marry me?

you'd see in a chess game maybe.

[FELICIA giggles]
You're always so silly!

Honestly, though, in my opinion,

73
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,916
that makes you
even more charming.

if the battle has
reached this far already,

[YUUTO] I hope Run's okay.
I'm worried.

I highly doubt you need
to worry about that one.

during the battle, did you?

I'm not even sure how I
would manage to get hurt.

I'm nowhere near
the front lines.

time mincing words,

so I'll just come
out and ask you.

Absolutely not!

more than a frail boy!

Hold your tongue. You will
not insult our patriarch.

I already told you no!

160
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:11,708
Okay, then what about
becoming my little sister?

161
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,541
Your little sister?

162
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,916
That's the compromise
I'm willing to make.

163
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,375
Unlike a child,

164
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,000
a younger sister or brother
has different privileges,

165
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,333
and they aren't
bound by servitude.

166
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:25,208
Sorry. I can't.
I'm part of the Horn Clan.

167
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,250
[YUUTO]
Such a shame.

168
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,125
You've left me with no choice.

169
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,083
In that case, your city will
share the same fate as Van!

170

[CITIZENS screaming]

172
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,083
[LINNEA] You'd really slay
all those innocent people

173
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,458
and burn it to the ground?

174
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:41,000
If you refuse my patronage,
yes, I will!

[LINNEA whimpers]

176
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,333
Make your choice. Hurry up.
I'm not a very patient man.

177
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,333
[LINNEA sobs]

178
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:03,083
Fine, you win.
I'll become your sister.

179
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,125
But only your sister,
understand?

180
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,083
I won't be your child!

181
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,041
That works for me.

182
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,125
[YUUTO sighs]

183
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,458
[RUN] Father,
is something the matter?

184
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,250
You're not feeling ill, are you?

185
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm good. Just really tired.

186
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,500
Thank goodness!

187
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,500
[FELICIA chuckles] You know,
lying on the floor like that

188
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,041
makes you seem a lot less scary

189
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,958
than the infamous leader
who goes around torching cities.

190
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,291
Of course, he's not scary.

191
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:35,125
He didn't burn anything.
He's not that type of man.

192
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:39,250
Father is far too kind to behave
in such a ruthless manner.

193
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,125
Well, it's not that
I'm kind, per se.

194
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,291
Naive? Definitely.

195
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,250
But having a story
that indicates differently

196
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,083
can sometimes limit
future bloodshed,

197
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,750
like it did today.

198
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,083
[FELICIA]
For what it's worth,

199
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:58,125
I've always found your naiveté
to be a very charming quality.

200
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,208
You should really try not

201
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,708
to be so hard on
yourself all the time.

202
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,750
Thank you for saying so,
Felicia.

203
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,541
It's only the truth.

204
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:10,791
You don't have to thank me,

205
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,125
especially since I'm the
one who summoned you.

206
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,000
It's the least I can do.

207
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,416
Hey, wait a sec!

208
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,833
I respect your charming
naive-uh-whatever it is, too!

209
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,083
[YUUTO]
Thank you as well, Run.

210
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,750
Oh, sure!

211
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,208
[YUUTO] Okay, it's time
to head back home.

212
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,916
Onward to Iarnvior!

It appears that you're still
as popular as ever, Big Brother.

Everything okay?

Huh? What? Yeah, sorry.

Why don't you try
answering your adoring crowd?

Right, I probably should, huh?

Ah, home sweet home!

[BRUNO] It's good to see you've
returned safely, Lord Yuuto.

224
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And congratulations. We heard
your victory was impressive.

225
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,541
All thanks to our soldiers.

226
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,916
You should know we prayed
to the goddess Angrbooa

227
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,125
so that the Wolf Clan
would triumph in battle.

228

Are they really trying
to say we won

229
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,500
because of their dumb prayers?

230

[FELICIA chuckles]

231
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:30,375
Anyway, I'm kinda in a rush.
So let's talk later!

232
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,708
[BRUNO]
Excuse me Lord Yuuto,

233
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,125
but don't you think
it's unacceptable

234
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:36,291
to speak to your uncles
in such a rude manner?

235
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,916
We are the younger brothers
of the last patriarch.

236
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,250
Show us some respect!

237
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,750
A relationship born of the
chalice must come first.

238
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,416
That has always been
the way of our people,

239
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,125
which I'm sure
you can understand.

240
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,333
Damn it! I'm in a hurry.

241
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,875
I'd be happy to
listen to your report

242

and relay it to him later.

to worry you.

But I'm honestly doing great.

It's wonderful to hear that.

I've missed you too, Mitsuki.

255

So, uh, have you found
a way back home, yet?

[YUUTO on phone]
No, not yet.

[MITSUKI]
Oh.

258
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,750
Well, promise me you'll
keep trying, okay?

259
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:50,583
I'll be waiting for you
for as long as it takes.

260
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:51,958
[YUUTO]
I will.

261
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:09,625
[YUUTO] This place, Yggdrasil,
probably isn't another world.

262
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,666
I think it's on Earth.

263
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,291
Judging by the tools they
use and their culture,

264
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:19,083
it's a time period somewhere
between 1300 and 2000 BC.

265
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,500
Basically, its Earth during
the late Bronze Age.

266
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,250
It has to be, because the
constellations here

267
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,583
are the same as
the ones on Earth.

268
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,916
Based on their location,

269
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I think it's somewhere in
the Northern Hemisphere,

270
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,208
but I'm not sure where exactly.

271

It's time to wake up.

00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,000
Uh, hey, good morning.

274
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,083
Good morning.
I hope you slept well.

275
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,666
It looks like it's going
to be a beautiful day.

276
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,708
I've brought you
a nice, fresh breakfast.

[sniffing]
Ah, it smells awesome!

278
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,291
Um, the rotor?

279
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,875
[YUUTO]
The rotary quern?

280
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:57,833
Yes, that's it.

281
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,083
Thanks to your great idea,

282
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,458
we can bake delicious
bread every single day!

283
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,791
Yeah, I'm always impressed

284
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,583
by how knowledgeable
you are, Father!

285
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,458
It's only because
of my smartphone.

286
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,000
Your smartphone?

287
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,833
Ah, it's been a while since
I've had a good night's rest.

288
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,333
I feel like I'm raring to go.

289
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,958
Yes, that much
seems fairly obvious.

290
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,833
Maybe I could help
you out with that.

291
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,208
It must be hard having
all that energy stored up.

292
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,208
Unfortunately,
I'm gonna have to pass,

293
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,166
but thank you for offering.

294
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,458
Oh?

295
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,291
I think your top half
and your bottom half

296
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,166
don't quite agree
with each other.

297
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,666
Stop it, Felicia,

298
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,333
or I will execute you for
making our lord uncomfortable!

299
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:36,500
[FELICIA] Listen, Run, it's
common knowledge that men have

300
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,375
to clean out their pipes
every once in a while,

301
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,083
or it can be bad
for their plumbing.

302
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,041
Wait. Is that how
it works? Really?

303
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,541
Be reasonable.

304
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,416
If it's not with us, it'll just
be with some other woman.

305
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,666
We might as well send him off

306
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,541
with some proper experience,
don't you think?

307
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,375
Well... that's a valid argument.

308
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,541
Wait, do you actually
believe her?

309
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,083
[RUN]
Okay then, I know that my body's

310
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,875
more muscular than curvy,
but I'll offer it to you anyway!

311
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,791
Uh, the only thing I want right
now is breakfast! I'm starving!

312
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,291
True. You shouldn't do
anything too strenuous

313
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,375
on an empty stomach.

314

He should really give
in to his urges.

00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,708
If nothing else,
it might help relieve

316
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,500
some of the stress
from his daily duties.

317
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,000
If we're going to make an
oath with the Horn Clan,

318
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:20,291
they'll need weapons,
preferably of iron.

319

Do you think Ingrid
can make them?

320
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:28,333
[INGRID] All right everyone,
time to remove the slag!

No way, Yuuto?

[YUUTO] Hey! It's been
a while, huh, Ingrid?

323
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Not sure why you look
so surprised, though.

324
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,083
Uh, no reason in particular.

325
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,875
I just didn't realize you were
already back in the city.

Some friend you are.

Everybody else seems
to know I'm here.

328
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,041
Hey, some of us have been
breaking our backs at the forge

329
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,541
since yesterday!

330
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,208
So I can't really spare
the time to think of you.

331

Well, I can always come
back later if you're busy.

You've already interrupted me!

There's no point
in you leaving now.

334
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,833
Might as well stick around.

335
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,250
Ahem.

336
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,166
Sorry, Lady Ingrid, but as
I've reminded you before,

337
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,000
you need to be more
respectful to the patriarch.

338
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,000
Apologize.

Anyway, I guess...

You don't have
to change anything.

349
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,208
Honestly, I wouldn't
know what to think

350
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,250
if you were suddenly nice.

351
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,666
Yes, I agree.

352
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,458
When it's just the two
of you, I think it's fine

353
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,041
to use your regular names
and be more informal.

354

Wait. What do you mean?
Like alone?

I don't think she means
anything weird by it.

356
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,833
She just means, like,

00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,416
if we were to make
something together again.

358

Right, of course, I knew that.

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,041
I mean, that makes
perfect sense, sir.

360
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:54,208
Oh, yeah. I wanted to tell you
the Horn Clan's patriarch

361
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,750
will be my new sister.

[INGRID]
The Horn Clan is joining us?

363
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:58,625
I think it'd be a good idea

364
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,208
for them to also
use iron weapons.

365
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,916
Sounds tricky, but okay then.

a lot of extra work.

handle it, though.

Thanks, Ingrid.

Yeah, right.
Leave it to me!

[ALEXIS]
Thank you for gathering here.

374
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,166
On this day, in the name
of the Divine Emperor,

375
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,791
I, Alexis,
will perform the ritual.

376
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,583
Join me in observing our
most sacred ceremony,

377
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,791
the Chalice of Allegiance.

378
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,666
[YUTTO] In Yggdrasil,
all the people in a clan

379
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,041
make an oath with the
patriarch over the chalice

380
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,625
and become his children
or younger siblings.

381
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,250
The ties created by the chalice

382
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,083
are stronger than
those of blood.

383
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,500
It's a holy ritual called
the Oath of Allegiance,

384
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,208
and it's meant to
bind a patriarch,

385
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,333
his children,
and siblings together.

386
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,500
That is how things are
done in this world.

387
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,083
This ritual should
make it possible

388
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,500
to rid the Wolf Clan
of all opposition

389
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,166
and bring peace to this realm.

390
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,250
All I want is to find
a way to get back home

391
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,208
without having to worry
about the people here.

may I have a word with
you outside, please?

394
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,208
[YUUTO]
Sure. I don't mind at all.

395
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:16,166
[LINNEA] I'm sorry. I don't
mean to inconvenience you.

396
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,541
It's all right. What'd you
need to talk about?

397
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,583
[LINNEA] I wanted to ask that
you treat the Horn Clan people

398
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,666
with the same respect
you would your own.

399

Please, I beg of you!

Do what you want with me.

Just be kind to my people.
That's all I ask.

You're totally safe here.

you're my new little sister,

00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,041
so I would never hurt you.

Oh, Big Brother.

What's wrong, Felicia?

We've just received

from Fort Horn at the border!

This is very serious,
so I'll get right to the point.

414
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,166
Four days ago,

415
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,291
one of the largest clans
to the west, the Hoof,

416
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:25,458
began an invasion of our
new sister nation, the Horn.

417
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,083
They've captured their
fort on the border.

418
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,375
Their forces number
around 10,000.

Wait, 10,000 soldiers?!

The Horn Clan hasn't recovered
from their recent defeat,

and Linnea isn't there, either.

It's literally the perfect
time for an invasion.

00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,708
It's my fault this happened.

425
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,000
Because I lost the battle.

[YUUTO]
I'm declaring this an emergency.

00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,875
I propose we go to the rescue
of the Horn Clan immediately!

Whatever for, Lord Yuuto?

It's not as if the
Wolf Clan is under attack.

430
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,458
This sounds like the
Horn Clan's problem, not ours.

I agree with Bruno!

I feel bad for the Horn Clan,

but we only made the
pact earlier today!

We don't exactly
owe them anything.

What are you saying?

[BRUNO] The Horn Clan were our
rivals until a few hours ago.

437
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,458
We should have just
made them slaves!

438
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:13,916
But instead,
we made them siblings

439
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,625
out of the goodness
of our hearts.

440

It's just that you're still
rather young, Lord Yuuto.
