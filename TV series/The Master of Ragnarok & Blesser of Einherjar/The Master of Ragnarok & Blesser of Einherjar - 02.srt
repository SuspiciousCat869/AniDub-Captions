Still, though,
the stirrup devices

that the Wolf Clan came up
with are pretty incredible.

Riding a horse by itself
can be a difficult task,

38

but with the stirrups, you have
a stable platform to fight from.

Uh, yes sir?

We'll need more
of those stirrups.

I want you to share them
with Linnea's cavalry.

If anything, you need
to keep a level head

00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:10,291
For your army to be well fed
while the enemy is famished.

96
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,208
To simply be waiting at ease.

97
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,291
It's the art of husbanding
one's strength.

It's actually a line
from Sun Tzu.

102

You can't fight at full strength
when you're tired and hungry.

So we eat, okay?

that the Wolf kid

Let's see how those dogs
handle our counter attacks.

I bet the Wolf brat
won't see that coming.

keep up with our forces.

We might actually win this.

Listen, there's a
distinct possibility

that the enemy will notice
the Phalanx's weak point

No. How are we supposed
to beat that demon?

164
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,500
Please, save me.
Save me, Big Brother!

165
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,333
This doesn't look good.

166
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:21,208
The Horn Clan's left flank
is being attacked by chariots.

167
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:24,333
Yes, I suspected they'd
discover our weakness.

168
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,333
Even so, it appears
to have happened faster

169
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,750
than you initially anticipated.

170
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,625
I was hoping
it would take longer,

171
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,208
but despite the
chaos in the field,

172
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,875
they discovered it
almost immediately

173
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,666
and launched a counterattack.

174
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,541
I should have
expected it. However...

175
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,083
"By holding out
advantages to him,

176
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:43,166
he can cause the enemy to
approach of his own accord."

177
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,875
I'll be the champion
of this battle of wits.

178
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,500
Even if I am cheating.

179
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,041
It looks like you didn't
plan for everything!

180
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,666
I'll shred you stupid
mutts into pieces!

181
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,208
They have one advantage,
and that's their chariots.

182
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,958
They'll utilize them
at every opportunity.

183
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,458
But that's where we
have the upper hand.

184
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,541
Because they've fallen
right into my trap.

It's go time.

Victory is ours!

I am Siegrune, Managarmr of
the powerful Wolf Clan!

I see that you are
also a strong warrior.

Who are you?

195
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,166
I am the Patriarch
of the Hoof Clan

196

and ruler of Alfheimr.
You may call me Yngvi!

Good.

Then when I bring you down,
the battle will be over.

You have my thanks as well.

It was a great honor to fight
such a worthy adversary.

Let's meet again in Valhalla.

Yngvi has been slain by

we're your escorts, silly,

Listen, not only is it rude
to interrupt his bath,

but it's also rude to
make a request like that

out of the blue.

249
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,583
Etiquette demands
that at the very least,

250
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,625
you should offer to wash
Big Brother's back first,

and then you can
propose marriage to him!

came out of nowhere.

such a strange request?

If you and I were
to get married,

278

then I think it would
help strengthen

the bond between our clans,

280
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,583
and even you can't deny
that both of our people

you're trying to make,

but you're the Patriarch
of the Horn Clan.

Do you really plan to
just abandon your title?

No, I don't.

286
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,416
Actually, my hope was
that you would agree

the Horn Clan by my side.

abandon his people?

I never said that!

He'd be free to keep ruling
the Wolf Clan as well!

But why should Big Brother
stick to ruling only one clan

Frankly, this deal sounds
too good to be true,

more than the Horn Clan.

that it's the strong
who should lead.

313

Hereditary rule
only leads to decay,

are chosen by merit.

320
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,416
Why does it matter if I tell you

321
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
when I'm already
trying to give it away?

322
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,708
Well, I get what
you're saying, but...

323
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,291
[LINNEA] For my father,
I was the precious child

324
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,250
he'd spent a long
time waiting for.

325
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,000
But I think he loved me
so much it blinded him.

326
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,666
[YUUTO]
And so because of that,

327
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,000
he made you his heir
instead of following tradition.

328
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,500
[LINNEA] Of course,
there were many people upset

329
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,500
that my father had appointed
an heir for himself.

330
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,375
I'm not even special,
like an Einherjar.

331
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,750
But I still wanted
to be our Patriarch!

332
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:46,916
I wanted to protect the things
my father loved and cared for!

333
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,541
I thought I could do it,
but I failed.

334
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,833
That's why I think someone
who's wonderful and smart,

335
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,250
like you, should lead
the Horn Clan,

336
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,625
instead of a stupid
hereditary fake like me.

337
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:03,291
So, please, I know I may not
be the best option available,

338
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,750
but I promise I'll
serve you forever.

339
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,083
If nothing else,
say you'll consider my offer.

340
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,500
Well, I, uh...

341
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,916
Might I interject?

342
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,208
While your offer
is very generous,

343
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,875
I would like to
remind our Patriarch

344
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:21,958
that it's not a decision

345
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,625
we should be making
by ourselves.

346
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,833
[YUUTO]
Uh... Yes, Felicia is right.

347
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,291
I should probably consult
with our clan members.

348
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,833
Right. Yes, of course.

349
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,625
And I apologize for
pressuring you like this.

350
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,583
Please, take your time.
I'll wait for your answer.

351
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:42,000
[YUUTO] Mm. We'll get back
to you. Sound good? Heh.

352
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,916
[YUUTO] What Linnea said
is really weighing on me.

353
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,750
And for that matter,
so is this dumb outfit.

354
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,250
[FELICIA giggles]

355
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,541
[FELICIA] You only have to
wear it for the victory ritual.

356
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,625
It's just for a little bit.

357
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,500
[YUUTO]
You know, from up here,

358
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:04,375
you can really see how different
the parts of Yggdrasil are.

359
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,291
If you were to take Big Sister
Linnea as your wife,

360
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,791
then the Horn Clan territory

361
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,458
would become part
of your domain.

362
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,541
[YUUTO] I'm not going
to marry her, Felicia.

363
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:15,875
[FELICIA]
But this is the perfect chance

364
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,625
to attack the Hoof Clan.

365
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,500
You could use this
land as a base,

366
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:20,875
and you'd be that much closer

367
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,500
to becoming the
ruler of Alfheimr.

368
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,708
Look, you make a good point,
but I still can't agree to it.

369
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,250
No matter how good of a deal
it may be for the Wolf Clan.

370
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,791
Right, please forgive me.

371
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,083
I became overzealous when
I heard we might be able

372
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:37,500
to take the entire Horn
Clan for ourselves.

373
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,916
But that's not
what you want, is it?

374
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Felicia, why did you recommend
that I marry Linnea?

375
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,750
Because I know that
you want to go home.

376
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:53,291
[FELICIA] Come on. It's what you
think about the most, right?

377
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:59,291
So, I was worried that you were
going to disappear on us,

378
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,166
and it frightened me.

379
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,291
[YUUTO]
I see.

380
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,458
But if you become Patriarch
of the Horn Clan,

381
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,875
then you'll keep fighting
the other clans.

382
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,625
And if you do that,

383
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,875
I thought maybe
you'd stay here with us.

384
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,166
[crying]

385
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,833
But that's a selfish thing
for me to hope for.

386
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,958
Don't cry. I'm sorry.

387
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:28,083
There's no reason for you
to apologize, Big Brother.

388
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,833
But I am sorry.

389
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,541
No matter how tough things were,

390
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,500
you've always been
there to support me.

391
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,666
I'm the one who's been selfish.

392
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,125
That's why I'm sorry.

393
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,625
Big Brother.

394
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,166
I just want you to know
that it makes me very happy

395
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,833
you've been able to rely
on me these past two years.

396
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,541
No matter how selfish
you think it is,

397
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:53,125
I always want you to be
honest with your feelings!

398
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,916
I'd like that.

399
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,625
Is it possible you can forget
about what I said earlier?

400
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:02,833
And in return, I promise to
keep doing my best for you!

401
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,416
Sure.

402
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,166
In fact, I'm kind of
counting on that one.

403
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,125
Because you're,
you know, my, uh...

404
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,125
You're, you know...

405
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,833
You're my most trusted friend.

406
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:21,458
[FELICIA] Yes. I swear
I won't let you down!

407
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,375
I'll stop this wedding
between you and Linnea!

408
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:28,291
Don't worry about a thing.
Just leave this one to me, okay?

409
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:31,416
[YUUTO]
Thank you. I'd appreciate it.

410
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,916
Right!

411
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,708
Just don't do
anything too crazy.

412
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:35,791
Right!

413
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,416
I'm serious!

414
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,125
Right!

415
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:42,500
[BOTH laughing]

416
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,750
[STEIN] The Wolf Clan Patriarch
has defeated the Claw Clan,

417
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,666
the Horn Clan, and now,
the Hoof Clan as well.

418
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,666
I can't wait to meet him
and see what he's like.

419
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,916
[chuckling]

420
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,375
[LINNEA]
La, la, la. La, la, la.

421
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:35,583
You look pretty happy.

422
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:37,416
Of course, I'm gonna be
Big Brother's wife,

423
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,250
so I'm learning to sing in case
I ever need to cheer him up.

424
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:41,375
Wait. That's not true!

425
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,041
Watch. Soon, I'll make my debut

426
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,708
as the first singing,
dancing Patriarch!

427
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,958
This preview was useless.
