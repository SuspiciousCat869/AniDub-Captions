In addition to the default
options presented in each event,

162
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,958
you can also use free responses
to level up affection!

163
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,625
No dating simulation
is more flexible.

164
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,708
During each predetermined
phase of the school day,

165
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,375
you must target your
preferred character,

166
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,500
say what it takes to
max out their affection,

167
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,083
and at the end of the day,
confess your feelings!

168
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,750
This leads to the ending.

169
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,750
With your current disadvantage,

170
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,958
there's only one
way to bounce back.

171
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:22,458
You'll have to use your
free form responses!

172
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,125
You should know more than most
about what Chisato likes.

173
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,708
Use that knowledge to come
up with perfect dialogue!

174
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,541
I'm on it.

175
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:34,208
[KAZUYA] It's time...
to conquer Chisato Chikaishi!

176
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,125
[CHISATO]
<i>Tsugumomo</i> !

177
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,416
[TATAMI]
<i>Tsugumomo</i> .

178
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,791
[KAZUYA] My school has taken
a turn for the bizarre,

179
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,750
thanks to a gal game
amasogi spawned

180
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,666
by Hiroshi Ookado's
desire to woo Chisato.

181
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,833
Kiriha's off searching for
the amasogi's location.

182
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,541
Meanwhile, to make sure
Hiroshi doesn't score,

183
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,208
I'm resolved to win
Chisato for myself.

184
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,458
Found her!

185
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,750
Chisato! Hey, wait up!

186
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:55,750
What do you want?

187
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,125
I was just on my
way to meet Hiroshi.

188
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:58,750
[gasps]

189
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,250
[KAZUYA]
So cold!

190
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,500
[OSAMU] To catch up with our
less-than-esteemed Hiroshi,

191
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,375
you'll be required to
score an affection combo

192
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,958
by repeatedly saying
the perfect thing.

193
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,333
Godspeed, my friend.

194
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,500
If you really need something,
please make it quick.

195
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,541
[KAZUYA]
Here goes.

196
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,500
The default answers
are predictably lame.

197
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,333
I have to think for myself.

198
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,791
This is Chisato. How can I
tempt her to hang out with me?

199
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,041
[gasps]

200
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,583
There was a problem that
I couldn't figure out

201
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,625
in math today!

202
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,625
Could you please
walk me through it?

203
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,916
Well, I am your
class representative,

204
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,916
so I guess I must.

205
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,958
All right! I'm a
beast! Let's go!

206
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,375
And now, you'll apply
that formula here.

207
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:59,333
Chisato. Your hand is so warm.

208
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,875
Please take this seriously.

209
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,416
[KAZUYA]
What went wrong?

210
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,291
That was a pretty
rough transition.

211
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,916
[OSAMU] Kazuya. This may
be your last chance.

212
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,500
Sorry if this is rude,

213
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,541
but I don't really see the point
in eating lunch with you two.

214
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,958
Please forgive this pair
of lonely gentleman

215
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:30,083
for wishing to adorn our table
with a delicate flower.

216
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,958
I've never been
called a flower.

217
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,583
[KAZUYA] Hey, I'm supposed to be
the one scoring points here.

218
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,833
[OSAMU] That was merely a bit
of conversational lubricant.

219
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:41,416
Sheesh. Talk about
obvious flattery.

220
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:47,125
[KAZUYA] The third option
seems too good to pass up.

221
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,416
But Osamu says the default
answers won't cut it!

222
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,375
I need something even better!
Something like--

223
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,625
[KAZUYA] There's something
about your lunches, Chisato.

224
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,500
[CHISATO]
Yeah?

225
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,583
[KAZUYA] They seem like the
kind that a mother would make.

226
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,458
My goodness,
what are you saying?

227
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,416
[KAZUYA chuckles]

228
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,583
[OSAMU]
Well done!

229
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,708
Knowing Chisato,
you spun your compliment

230
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,708
so as to put her in the
position of a mother.

231
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,041
I can think of no better way

232
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,375
you could've praised
her efforts!

233
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,541
[CHISATO] You can have
a bit, if you'd like.

234
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,958
[KAZUYA]
Really? Thanks a bunch!

235
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,000
Wow! This is the
fluffiest egg I've had!

236
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,125
I could eat this every day!

237
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,875
You would make a
fine wife, Chisato!

238
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,041
[gasping]

239
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,041
[KAZUYA] My first combo!
Maybe I can pull this off!

240
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,791
[OSAMU]
Right! Keep the pressure on!

241
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,000
Oh, by the way, Kazuya,

242
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,791
did Kiriha come to
school with you today?

243
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,750
[OSAMU]
Why isn't there a window?

244
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:55,583
A free input conversation event.
If he answers carelessly--

245
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,375
Yeah. You might not've
noticed her in gym clothes.

246
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,250
I think she's napping.

247
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,500
She does enjoy her naps.

248
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:07,166
And her gym clothes.
Or are they your clothes?

249
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,000
Affection decreasing.

250
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,125
[KAZUYA] How come?
There wasn't even a window!

251
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:18,291
[OSAMU] Focus. This conversation
event isn't over yet.

252
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,750
There are negative combos
as well as positive ones.

253
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:24,333
You need to get out of this
hole with your next response!

254
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:29,125
Tell me, Kazuya, do you like it
when Kiriha wears gym clothes?

255
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:33,208
I mean, they're kinda the only
decent clothes she has, so--

256
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,208
It almost sounds like
there are other costumes

257
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,666
you have her wear.

258
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,125
Well, she can't go
around naked all day.

259
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:43,000
So she lets you see
her naked, does she?

260
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,541
Hey! Help me out, Osamu!

261
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,125
A bomb just showed up!

262
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,041
Crap. What do I do now?

263
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,541
[OSAMU]
Defuse it! Quickly!

264
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,500
[KAZUYA yells]

265
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,333
You're the worst.

266
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,791
So... I take it you failed?

267
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,708
[KAZUYA]
This game is impossible.

268
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,708
That negative combo
could not have come

269
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,833
at a less opportune moment.

270
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:12,000
Your affection level is
likely sub-zero now.

271
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,666
What about you?
Did you find the game?

272
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,541
Afraid not.
It eludes me for now.

273
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:21,500
Osamu. Has he any
option left in game?

274
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,041
There's one last chance.

275
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,250
It could allow you to
max her affection level

276
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,583
in one fell swoop.

277
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:27,875
[BOTH]
Huh?!

278
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:28,833
Seriously?

279
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,791
Why not mention this earlier?

280
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,208
I was hoping we could
rely on standard combos.

281
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,000
It would've been less risky.

282
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,541
This isn't really
a legitimate tactic.

283
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,416
It's more what you'd
call an exploit.

284
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,166
I'm not sure what the
chances are that it'll help,

285
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,833
but it's our final option.

286
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,458
Come what may, we'll
have to take the gamble.

287
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,375
How does this exploit work?

288
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,875
It's called an NTR combo.

289
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,750
What the heck does that mean?

290
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,875
[scraping]

291
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,250
Even though this is
referred to as a combo,

292
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,833
you just get one shot.

293
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:04,125
After school, when normally the
only option would be to confess,

294
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,625
there is a certain
sequence of inputs

295
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:09,541
that will trigger one last
conversation event.

296
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,166
Use that bug perfectly,

297
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,750
and you can exceed the
maximum level of affection.

298
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,291
In other words...

299
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,875
In other words.

300
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,625
With a single
well-crafted sentence,

301
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,583
you can blow our
less-than-esteemed Hiroshi's

302
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,333
score out of the water!

303
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,958
You have one advantage
in all this.

304
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,666
You and Chisato have been
friends since you were kids.

305
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,125
Sift through every memory
of your past with her.

306
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,375
Is there something you
can remind her of?

307
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,708
A shared experience you
can use to touch her heart?

308
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,166
Chisato.

309
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,041
Yes, Hiroshi?

310
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,666
The thing is, I think I'm in--

311
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,041
[KAZUYA]
I object!

312
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,083
Hold that confession.

313
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,083
Hold it right there.

314
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,583
[HIROSHI]
What is it now?

315
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,666
Nobody wants you
to be here, man.

316
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,958
Just go home, Kazuya.
You're interrupting.

00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,625
You're plannin' to try the
NTR combo exploit, aren't ya?

318
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,208
You didn't actually think I
wouldn't know about it?

319
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,416
So what if it lets you
bypass the score limit?

320
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,541
There's no way you'll come
up with a good enough one liner.

321
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,541
Sorry I got here late,

322
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,875
it took me a while
to find these.

323
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:43,791
Hey, Chisato. Let's play
house again, okay?

324
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,791
Here. You can be
the daddy, Kazuya.

325
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:57,208
Uh, do we have to
play house again?

326
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,416
Kazuya's having a tea
party with dolls!

327
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,500
Jeez, man. Talk
about sissy boy.

328
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:06,208
I'm sick of this. I'm gonna
play something else.

329
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:14,083
[CHISATO]
Oh. Okay. But...

330
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:17,458
Would you mind taking
the daddy doll with you?

331
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:21,916
I'll keep the mommy doll, so if
you ever do wanna play, we can!

332
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,375
We can play house
anytime you want.

333
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,958
I'll be waiting.

334
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,916
You want to?

335
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,166
Well, how could
I say no to that?

336
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,958
[yells]

337
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,750
Impossible!

338
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:58,166
[HIROSHI crying]

339
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,375
Very well played.

340
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,583
[HIROSHI]
I couldn't even win in a game?

341
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:06,083
[KIRIHA] Hey, wait! You need
to destroy the amasogi!

342
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,166
A loser both in his
games and in his life.

343
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,125
It must be mortifying.

344
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,250
[KAZUYA sighs]

345
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,666
Man, I am beat.

346
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,041
Hiroshi's missing.

347
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,416
But he's probably still
somewhere in the school.

348
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,208
We'll find him and extract
the amasogi's location.

349
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,083
You two can rest up here.

350
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,958
[CHISATO]
Are you okay, Kazuya?

351
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:31,958
Yeah, I'm fine.

352
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:35,000
Just a little tired from
all this excitement.

353
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,166
[KAZUYA]
That's right.

354
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,083
Her affection is still
maxed out for me.

355
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,500
Huh. Guess I'll just take a
nap in this other bed then.

356
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,541
You sleep tight.

357
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:58,333
[CHISATO breathing heavily]

358
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,833
[KAZUYA]
Huh?

359
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,208
[KAZUYA gasps]

360
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,666
What the--?

361
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,208
Time to play house.

362
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,958
[KAZUYA screaming]

363
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,791
You be the daddy, okay?

364
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,875
[OSAMU]
Wait. What did you just say?

365
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,333
[HIROSHI]
You heard me.

366
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,500
I was running it on one of
the PCs in the computer lab.

367
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,708
Is that significant
to you somehow?

368
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:43,500
The PC version of <i>Pure</i>
<i>Heart</i> is quite different.

369
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:47,083
It's basically <i>Pure</i>
<i>Heart</i> X-rated!

370
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,500
In other words, it's porn.

371
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,833
[KIRIHA grunts]

372
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,333
[KAZUYA] And then the
mommy untied the daddy

373
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,708
so he could go to the bathroom!

374
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,625
[CHISATO] No. They were
determined to become one.

375
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,375
The daddy needed some help,
but the mommy was willing.

376
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,333
[KAZUYA]
Uh! No, stop, please!

377
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,625
[OSAMU]
Frankly, those two could enter

378
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,666
the final event at any second.

379
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,208
[KIRIHA]
That's bad. That's really bad!

380
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,250
[OSAMU] Hiroshi and I will
shut down the game.

381
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,125
You go pry her off him.

382
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,875
[KIRIHA]
Kazuya!

383
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,666
[OSAMU]
Tell me.

384
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,833
How far did they actually get?

385
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,291
I arrived just too
late to find out.

386
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,458
They'd already separated
when I got there.

387
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,166
And Kazuya was
strangely resistant

388
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,916
to my interrogation techniques.

389
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,958
It matters not, though.

390
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,291
[CHISATO giggles]

391
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,625
[KIRIHA] They shared the
memory of playing house

392
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,625
one last time.

393
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,083
[KAZUYA] Their shrine
destroyed once again,

394
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,625
Kukuri and Kokuyou
are in real trouble.

395
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:34,041
They go to Kanayama, the local
god of another region,

396
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,458
to ask for a loan.

397
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,333
But she does not
pay out for free.

398
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,125
<i>Tsugumomo</i> , Chapter 7:
"Kanayama- <i>san</i> ."

399
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,458
Don't miss it!
