The range of Sunao's sword
should be fairly short.

it's that funny.

158
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,833
[KANAKA chuckles]
Of course not, I'm sorry.

159
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,833
So, what's going on?

160
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:37,000
[KAZUYA] Well, Kiriha's never
exactly gentle with me.

161
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,083
But she was seriously
brutal today.

162
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,625
We were talking about
the duel tomorrow

163
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,916
and she blew up
out of nowhere.

164
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,625
Not sure if I agree that
it was out of nowhere.

165
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,041
[KAZUYA]
Huh?

166
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,708
[KANAKA]
The thing about Kiriha

167
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,708
is she's always been
protecting people.

168
00:09:55,791 --> 00:10:00,791
That goes for you, me,
and her previous wielder.

169
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:05,625
t's been especially true for
you though, hasn't it, Kazuya?

170
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:09,250
And then you went
and turned the tables.

171
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,125
I'm sure that startled her.

172
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:14,083
Heck. It might've
taken her breath away.

173
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,291
[KAZUYA] 
So... she wasn't mad then?

174
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,333
Kiriha's really quite
a sweetheart. Don't you agree?

175
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:22,416
[KAZUYA]
Huh? Yeah. I guess so.

176
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,041
I certainly hope
you'd guess so.

177
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,375
After all the naughty things
you've done with her.

178
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,541
[KAZUYA]
Huh?

179
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,041
[KAZUYA gasps]

180
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,500
First this, then that,
and to top it all off--

181
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,875
No! I...

182
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,625
[KANAKA]
And not just with her, either.

183
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:37,708
You've been a busy boy.

184
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,666
[KAZUYA yelps]

185
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,166
[KIRIHA]
Kazuya.

186
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,791
[KANAKA] You know, most boys
your age stick with porn.

187
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,958
Hey! Cut it out with
these weird illusions.

188
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,583
You're freaking me out!

189
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,708
You're definitely making those
illusions yourself, buster.

190
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,625
I mean we are hanging out
in your dream, aren't we?

191
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:55,625
[KAZYUA gasps]

192
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,875
I really made them myself?

193
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,208
[KAZUYA] Okay. Then I should
be able to get rid of them.

194
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,333
[KAZUYA grunts]

195
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,208
[DUDES]
Kazuya.

196
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,541
[KAZUYA gasps]

197
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,166
[yelps]

198
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:10,541
[KANAKA chuckles]
Nicely done.

199
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,958
Someone in your position
is gonna need at least

200
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,208
that much willpower.

201
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,625
I guess so.

202
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,916
[KANAKA] Still. You may as
well experiment with her.

203
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,458
Experiment?

204
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:23,291
[KANAKA] That's what I said.
You know Kiriha wouldn't mind.

205
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:26,291
I'm sure she'd be quite
gentle in that context.

206
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:32,291
[KAZUYA sighs]
I think so too, but...

207
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,708
[gasps]

208
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,791
[KAZUYA] I love the way things
are right now. You know?

209
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:42,041
[KAZUYA] Kiriha, Kukuri,
Kokuyou, and Chisato.

210
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:46,375
They're great. I really enjoy
just being around them.

211
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,041
If something more
happened with any of them,

212
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,166
I feel like that might
change things too much.

213
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:58,000
[KANAKA]
Huh... Yeah, I see your point.

214
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:03,333
[KANAKA gasps] Looks like dawn.
I'd better get going.

215
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:07,458
[KAZUYA] See ya later,
previous malison cleanser.

216
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,916
Right. Catch ya later.

217
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:15,250
The previous malison cleanser.

218
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,291
Wait. I thought that the
previous malison cleanser

219
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:22,083
was my mother. But if my mother
was suppose to be the previous

220
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:26,208
malison cleanser, then wouldn't
that mean that she's...

221
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,250
Wait... no...

222
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,083
[KANAKA]
Don't hurt yourself, kiddo.

223
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:34,625
That thought's been sealed away,
so you can't connect the dots.

224
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:38,500
Take it easy. It'll come back
to you one of these days.

225
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,333
And until then? I'll be waiting.

226
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:54,750
[KAZUYA gasps]

227
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,666
It was just a dream,
macho men are not your thing,

228
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,541
it was just
a dream, it's fine!

229
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,375
[KAZUYA, KIRIHA]
Tsugumomo!

230
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,750
[SUNAO, KOTETSU]
Tsugumomo.

231
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,791
[KAZUYA grunts]

232
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,000
[SUNAO grunts]

233
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,958
[KUKURI]
The bonds are made.

234
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,625
From here on out, any injury
one of you would get will be

235
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,250
inflicted on these
dolls instead.

236
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,791
There are three ways
that this duel can end.

237
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,500
The water doll's power only
works on this hallowed ground,

238
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,291
so if ya leave, ya lose.

239
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,708
The main two ways to win are
by breaking your opponent's

240
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,916
water doll, or getting
them to surrender.

241
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,541
Those are all the rules
we've got, so keep 'em in mind.

242
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,000
All right. The malison
cleanser of Kamioka

243
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:44,458
has been challenged
to a duel for his title.

244
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,208
And the Incarnation
of Hakusan Myouri,

245
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,708
Kukuri-hime no Ookami,
has agreed to preside.

246
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,666
I'm sure you'll both
fight with honor.

247
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,583
[SUNAO] To become a malison
cleanser like my brother.

248
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,375
And to surpass Kanaka,
who stole my vendetta,

249
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,375
I have trained and trained,

250
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:03,041
pushing myself to the
limit since I was a child.

251
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,791
But this boy...

252
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,333
[SUNAO]
It just "kind of happened?"

253
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:10,916
Yeah, pretty much. Well,
Kukuri ordered me to do it,

254
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,416
so I didn't have a choice.
But, whatever. So it goes.

255
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,083
[SUNAO
This brat didn't work at all

256
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,625
to become Kanaka's successor.
He didn't even want it.

257
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,833
He's my foe alright.
It's my duty to teach him that

258
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:28,125
things won't always be so easy.

259
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,708
[KOTETSU]
Suou lost his life because

260
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,125
I was too weak to protect him.

261
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:37,000
If we lose this battle too,
it'll be because of my weakness.

262
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,208
Again...

263
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,583
I can't let it come to that.

264
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,875
[KAZUYA]
Ignorant and unprepared.

265
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,208
That's what I was when I first
became malison cleanser.

266
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,166
But I've grown since then.

267
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,958
If I have to inflict malison
on the people around me,

268
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,291
then I have to be the
one to protect them.

269
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:59,916
This is my duty. More than
anyone else can claim.

270
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,916
And besides...

271
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,708
Kotetsu? My tool is
none of your concern.

272
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,458
[KAZUYA]
Why be so mean to him?

273
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,125
[SUNAO]
Because he belongs to me.

274
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:14,750
And when I own an object,
I use it however I please.

275
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,041
[KAZUYA]
Tsugumomo are more than tools.

276
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:22,416
They're our partners. We have to
beat Sunao to prove that true.

277
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,083
Alright. We've waited
long enough.

278
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,750
[KIRIHA] Time we paid them
back for before, Kazuya!

279
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,125
[KAZUYA grunts]

280
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,166
Combatants at the ready...

281
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,708
[KUKURI]
Begin!

282
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,083
[KAZUYA grunts]

283
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,875
[SUNAO]
Why's he moving forward?

284
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,333
Dummy Weave!

285
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:56,875
[SUNAO, KAZUYA grunting]

286
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,916
[SUNAO] That thing again?
I'll tear it to shreds.

287
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,708
[KIRIHA] Get ready, Kazuya.
Do it just as we planned.

288
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:15,916
Right!

289
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,000
[SUNAO]
Empty Blade!

290
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,833
[SUNAO grunts]

291
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,250
[KOTETSU]
Are you alright?

292
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,125
We got her!

293
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,500
[KIRIHA] A glancing blow.
Stay wary and hold this range.

294
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,541
We're ill-matched
against that sword,

295
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,333
but her empty blade is
just a projection technique.

296
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,958
It's weaker than the real blade,

297
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,083
and far easier enough
to defend against.

298
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,500
What's more, we know
she needs time in between

299
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,333
attacks to recharge. Once we've
parried her next strike,

300
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,583
we'll use that time to counter.

301
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,166
[HONOKA] Seems your boy's
waiting to riposte. Clever.

302
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,125
[KUKURI]
Huh?

303
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,666
Honoka. You came.

304
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,083
Yeah. Thought I'd send
an avatar, at least.

305
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,666
Huh. I heard he was
a worthless coward.

306
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,833
Completely lacking in skill.

307
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:08,208
But the kid's putting on
a surprisingly good show.

308
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,250
They make nice rivals,
don't ya think?

309
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,708

[SUNAO] He's figured
out my range exactly.

312
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,583
As long as he has those
dummies to block my strikes,

313
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,208
he can dart in right
after to counterattack.

314

[KIRIHA] She's starting to
catch on to our strategy.

Then let's change it.

We should step back

they're planning.

Whoa. That's impressive.
They've got her on the ropes.

00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:56,375
Huh. This seems a lot more
one-sided than it ought to be.

[KOTETSU] He's changing
his tactics and obi weaves

330

too quickly for you
to dodge on reflex.

Let's retreat for now and
come up with a plan.

Don't be such a damn coward.

I'll face him head on,
take everything he's got,

Sunao seems to want more.

Why don't we oblige her?

even started fighting!

[KUKURI chuckles]

348
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,583
[KIRIHA] She's blocking
everything we throw at her.

349
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,291
Still, a sword's
offensive by nature.

350
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,291
If she can't attack,
she can't defeat us.

351
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:05,500
[SUNAO exhales] So this
is what they came up with.

Not bad. But it won't be enough.

353
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,833
[KIRIHA] She'll be
expecting us to counter now,

354
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,916
so keep it quick, alright?

They've barely even
started fighting.

375
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,125
Their plan was to exploit
the cooldown time

376
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,125
between Sunao's
ranged attacks.

Let's see if they can adapt it.

She's firing consecutive
strikes, and at greater range.

379
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,125
Is she doing what I think?

380
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,875
Yup. By reducing
the power of each attack,

381
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,375
she's able to chain
them together

382
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,041
and extend their range.

383
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:20,333
Which, I have to say,
requires a great deal of skill.

up his sleeve, you'll see!

Kazuya! What are you doing?

[KAZUYA] I need two
obi for a shield weave.

But with one projection missing,

406
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,750
that would mean blocking
with the original.

And if I do that, Kiriha will...
