Wake. Morning has come.

00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,958
Some servant. Sleeping in
later than your master.

00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,208
Cease your insolence.

[KAZUYA] Cut it out, sis.
I'm still tired.

10
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:52,791
That weird youkai
kept me up all night.

11
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:55,750
[KIRIHA] Even in your sleep,
you provoke me.

12
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,416
You've sealed your fate.

As long as she hasn't
called attendance yet...

You are just the worst!
Every time you're tardy,

29
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:17,000
you insult this entire
school! You hear me?

30
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,875
Business as usual for them.

31

The class rep seems to be
exceptionally stern with Kazuya.

[CHISATO] Are you even
listening to me? Ugh.

This is all Kiriha's fault.

How is it already past 8?

36
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,875
I set my alarm clock;
I'm sure of it!

00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,208
[KIRIHA] Oh. That's
what it's called?

38
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:37,416
It rang most obnoxiously,
so I silenced it.

00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,458
Besides, you've never
left me at home before.

45
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,333
[KAZUYA] That was different; you
were just a cloth back then!

46
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,708
This is bad.

47
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:59,000
If I let her spout this
"servant" stuff at school...

48
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,041
Bow to me! Dumb servant.

Hmph. That's right you will.

53
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,166
[KAZUYA] But might I make
one humble request?

54
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,708
[KIRIHA]
Huh...?

55
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,750
I am an obi once more!
Will that do?

56
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,875
[KAZUYA] Perfectly!
Thanks a million.

57
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,666
Now I'll just put you in
this bag to keep you clean.

58
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,708
[KIRIHA] A commendable
precaution!

59
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,375
[KAZUYA] And this
box here'll stop you

60
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,083
from getting damaged
if you're jostled.

61

[KIRIHA]
How considerate.

62
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,250
[KAZUYA] Finally,
I'll tie the box up

63
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,166
so it won't break open
if it's dropped.

64
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,875
[KIRIHA]
Very thorough.

Serves her right. Stupid youkai.

Ya wanna share your
joke with the class?

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,916
I think Chisato's
finally broken him.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,666
Nah, don't worry
about it. It's nothing.

72
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,666
Kay, well, anyway, back to what
I was saying. Rumor has it that

73
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,791
after school, when almost no
one's around, a ghost appears.

74
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,916
That's simply ridiculous.

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,416
Tell that to the many
people who've seen it

76
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,958
with their own eyes.
Some saw a weird slug,

77
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,166
and some a weird hairy thing.

78
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,875
[OSAMU] Uh huh. Sounds more
like an unidentified animal

79
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,291
than a ghost.

80
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,583
[KAZUYA groans]
Pretty sure it was that.

81

Kazuya. Are you listening, man?

82
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,833
[KAZUYA] Sorry,
I kinda zoned out.

83
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,125
Well, what I'm getting at is
that this is the perfect time

84
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,916
for a test of courage!
Invite a cute little lady

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,958
to wander the dark
hallways by your side!

86
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,083
Huddled close,
holding hands, maybe.

87
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:38,708
If you're lucky, a kiss!
If you're sly, a fondle!

Play your cards perfectly,
and Eden awaits!

is sweet! Mmm...

[KAZUYA]
What did I do?

92
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,208
That's what you think
adolescence is?

93
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,041
Perhaps instead of cooking up
these ridiculous schemes,

94
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:59,708
you could be double-checking the
reports that're due 5th period.

95
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,875
Reports? I totally forgot!

96
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,083
Please, Osamu!
Lemme copy yours!

97
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,833
That'll cost twenty pages
of screentone for my manga.

98
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:08,833
[CHISATO]
Copy?

[KAZUYA yelps]

100
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,958
You'll copy nothing.
We still have lunchtime!

101
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,916
I'll even assist you, but you're
doing the work yourself.

There's no way I'll finish
in time. Lemme see yours.

108
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:35,125
This is so doable.
Just move your hands

109
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,583
instead of your mouth.

110
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,958
I mean...

111
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,958
That part is clearly wrong.

112
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,750
Prince Shotoku came after
the warring states period.

113

Mm...

114
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,500
Fine, I'll actually try,
are ya happy now?

115
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,500
I will be when you're done.

Did I get something else wrong?

120
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,750
[CHISATO]
No. Sorry.

121
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,916
I was thinking about how we'd
do this when we were little.

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,250
[KAZUYA] Oh, yeah.
I remember that.

123
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,708
You were a pretty intense tutor.

124
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,083
Thank you for your assistance.

125
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,583
[CHISATO] You are quite
welcome, of course.

126
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:22,708
I was falling behind back then,
so you were a really big help.

[CHISATO] And you're
doing better now?

[KAZUYA]
Ah...?

132
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:49,125
[CHISATO] I wouldn't mind
coming to your house again.

133
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:52,416
I could help catch you up
on your studies. I mean,

134
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,500
teaching others has always been
something I found enjoyable, so.

135
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,458
You mean it?
Yeah, that'd be gre--

[KIRIHA chuckles]

137
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,333
Um... Now wouldn't
be a great time.

138
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,916
[CHISATO] Oh, no worries.
Sorry for being so meddlesome.

Oh, that was the last page.

141
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,666
Guess I'll go put the books up.

00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,458
Hey, way to go.

143
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,916
All right.
I'll see you back at class.

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,333
[KAZUYA]
Sure. Thanks again, Chisato!

Heh. Kazuya.

Hey, Kazuya. Is everything okay?

155
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,500
Oh, yeah, I'm good.

156
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,833
[CHISATO] What happened
to your face?!

157
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:11,458
Nothing, I'm fine. Yup.
Everything is just fine.

158
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,291
Weren't you heading
back to class, though?

159
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,208
We've only got a few minutes.

160
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,833
Yeah, I know, but the
door won't open.

Come on!

00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,083
The windows
won't open, either.

[KAZUYA pants]

167
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,333
[KAZUYA] I thought
the door was just jammed.

168
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,541
But if the windows
are stuck too...

169
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,500
That's every exit.

170
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,875
[KAZUYA]
We've been trapped.

171
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,000
Huh? Hmm...

00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,125
[KAZUYA]
All right. I give up.

00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,791
[KAZUYA sighs]

179

Not only do they refuse to open,
they're unbreakable now.

00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,458
[CHISATO]
This is weird.

[KIRIHA] This is quite
the quandary, Kazuya.

183
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,708
Seems you've gotten
your comeuppance

184
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,583
for trying to leave me behind.

185

[KAZUYA pants]

00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:40,833
What's this? Feeling
amorous this morning?

193
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:44,458
What? No, I'm not. How did
you even follow me here?

194
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:48,833
Wait. The door thing. Are you
doing this to get back at me?

195
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:52,000
Heh. I'd hardly bother with
such roundabout measures.

196
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,875
[sound of punches landing]

197
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,500
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

198
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,750
My preferred type of abuse
is very much physical.

199
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,166
Ya don't say...

200
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,333
At any rate, should misfortune
befall you near here,

201
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:06,875
it's safe to assume that
a Tsukumogami caused it.

202
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,875
Wait, a tsukumogami...
So another youkai like you?

203
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,625
[sound of punches landing]

204
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,000
I said it again.

205
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,750
Not at all like me, imbecile.

206
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,083
Heed my words.

207
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,375
Tsukumogami generally
fall into two categories.

208
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,166
Ones like myself arise from
objects after many years

209
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,375
of human use. We are
known as Tsugumomo.

210
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,375
In contrast, the tsukumogami
that attacked you yesterday

211
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:34,000
was one which took form quickly,
due to intense human emotions.

212
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,750
It's called an Amasogi.

213
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,750
A Tsugumomo has a fully
developed conscience.

214
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:43,083
We are enlightened creatures.
As you can see.

215
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,541
[KAZUYA groans]

216
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,916
[KIRIHA] But Amasogi
are like mewling infants

217
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,083
with magic powers.
They cause problems

218
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,916
like this quite regularly.

219
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,208
We shall need help
to resolve this.

220
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,333
That friend of yours
should do nicely.

221
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,583
[KAZUYA]
Aah...!

222
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,041
Wait, before you go...!

223
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,583
[KIRIHA]
Huh?

224
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,791
[CHISATO]
Uh...

225
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,291
Hello there!
Thank you for waiting.

226
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,541
[CHISATO] It's nice to meet you.
I'm Chisato Chikaishi.

227
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,208
Right, and I am Kiriha,
the tsukumoga--

228
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,500
[KAZUYA yelps] Just tell her
the story we agreed on, okay?

229
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,291
[KIRIHA]
Fine, have it your way.

230
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,875
[KIRIHA clears throat]

231
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:26,625
Uh... I am Kazuya's cousin, and
I am here to visit his school.

232
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:30,333
Uh... Name's Kiriha Obina.
Nice to meet you.

233
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,791
[CHISATO]
Sounds likely.

234
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,166
Anyway. Supernatural
stuff's like a hobby for her.

235
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,708
So, she knows a lot
about weirdness.

236
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:41,416
She thinks she can find a way
out, but she needs our help.

237
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,958
Oh...

238
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,333
[CHISATO] So, in your view...
This supernatural situation

239
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,791
is being caused by one of these
so-called "Amasogi." Right?

240
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,250
Exactly! Such an
intelligent girl.

241
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:58,208
Now then. We can move on
to escaping its grasp.

242
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,583
I am unsurprised that smashing
the doors and windows

243
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,458
was all his undeveloped mind
could come up with.

244
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,833
You're lucky I'm here.

245
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,625
Sure we are.

246
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,541
[KIRIHA]
Both of you take one.

247
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,500
What are they?

248
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,791
[KIRIHA] Kimono clasps.
Interwoven with my hair.

249
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,916
If they come into the
proximity of any spirit,

250
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,833
they should react.

251
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:23,458
[KAZUYA] So this'll show us
where the Amasogi is?

252
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,958
That's correct.
The Amasogi must be acting

253
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:29,208
on the wish of whoever's
emotions gave rise to it.

254
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,041
If we can find out
what that wish is,

255
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,458
the rest will
likely prove simple.

256
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,708
But who would want to
trap us in the library?

257
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,291
I can't think of anyone
who would benefit.

258
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,625
[KAZUYA]
Huh. I can't either.

259
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,125
There's no use in
idle speculation.

260
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,375
Go. Get started already.

261
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,125
Yeah, yeah.

262
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,458

Ha, ha, ha!
That was fast.

267
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,791
[CHISATO]
Could it be this book?

[CHISATO, KIRIHA gasp]

269
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,125
I found one.
Check it out!

270

Are there two Amasogi?

Hm.

Very well. I have
concocted a simpler plan.

Now I see. It would appear that
this entire study's an Amasogi.

Yes. Most disappointing.

[KAZUYA yelps]

[KIRIHA] Think back to your

00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,291
when you first
came into the study.

330
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,916
[KAZUYA] What?
How would that help?

331
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,041
Just do it!

332
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,458
Okay, uh...

333
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,916
Well, I wasn't really sure
what books we should get.

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,916
[KIRIHA]
Aye.

335
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,625
So Chisato pulled down
a few books for me.

336
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,041
[KIRIHA]
And then?

337
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:48,416
Oh, yeah! I mistook Sudoku
for a Warring States Warlord!

338

His name is Prince Shotoku!

00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,875
Doesn't matter! What else?

340
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,541
After that, she asked me
if I want her to come over

341
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,833
and help me study
sometime. I said no!

342

What makes you think that?

348
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:15,083
I told you what makes Amasogi.
It's strong human desires.

[CHISATO gasps]

350
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,875
Stop asking dumb questions
and grant her desire!

Chisato's desire?
Oh, yeah. Chisato!

[BOOK MONSTER roars softly]

We're back.

Ahh... That's that...
My work is done here.

361
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,958
Thanks a bunch.
You saved us.

362
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,875
And on top of that,
I understand Amasogi better.

363
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:18,208
[KIRIHA] Mm. Then it
was all worthwhile.

364
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,125
As for you, Chisato...

365
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,625
Yes? What is it?

366
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:26,875
Sorry I didn't realize sooner.
How you felt, I mean.

367
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,875
But you... do now?

Yeah, I do...

people, don't you?

[KAZUYA]
Chisato? Why're you here?

384
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,375
Because you invited
me to come over

385
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,791
and study with you
at 1:00, you jerk!

Again?! Really?!

388
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,875
[KIRIHA] What's all
the fuss about?

389
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,541
[CHISATO] I brought these.
Help yourself.

390
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,583
[KIRIHA squeals]
Well done!

391
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,833
[KIRIHA giggles, hums]

392
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,708
[CHISATO]
Kazuya. Kiriha.

393
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:39,000
I'd like to apologize
for yesterday.

394
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,500
I never imagined that something
like that could happen.

395
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,166
Let alone that I could cause it.

396
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,208
[KIRIHA] The blame
is not yours alone.

397
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,625
[CHISATO]
Huh...?

398
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:51,458
[KIRIHA] There is a much
larger force at play. Malison.

399
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,583
"Malison"?

400
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,583
I've never heard of that.
What is it?

401
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:58,583
[KIRIHA] How to describe it...
It's a distortion in reality.

402
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,916
Some think it the
root of all creation.

403
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,375
Some think it a mere vestige.

404
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,958
[KAZUYA] I'm really
not following.

405
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,333
No one's surprised.

406
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,000
It can warp our natural
laws, but it does so

407
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,416
only in response to the
will of sentient beings.

408
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,875
In theory, one could wield
the power of malison

409
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,458
to shape the world
to one's will.

410
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,208
Seriously? You can
make it do anything?

411
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,375
[KIRIHA] At normal densities,
the effects of malison

412
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,125
are rather limited. That's
why events like the one

413
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,250
we had at the library
yesterday are so rare.

414
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,458
Wait, so for that to happen,
there must've been

415
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,875
a high concentration
of malison there.

416
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,166
Precisely. What's more,
there's a system in place

417
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,541
for preventing such
things from happening.

418
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,625
That much malison never
should've accumulated.

419
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,375
So what went wrong?

420
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:46,458
The blame rests with the god
who oversees this area.

421
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,958
[KAZUYA]
A god?

422
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:52,958
Aye. Our local god.
That idiot Kukuri did this.

423
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,166
[KAZUYA] Kiriha and I
are taken to a shrine

424
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,750
by a mysterious priestess
named Kokuyou.

425
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,833
There, the masked god
Kukuri awaits us.

426
