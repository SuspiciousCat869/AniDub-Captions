00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,250
[KAZUYA chuckles]

161
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,291
[KUKURI]
For real though.

162
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,125
That was an awesome
fight to see.

163
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,708
Yeah. Albeit with an
obvious outcome.

164
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,666
I don't know about all that.

165
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,375
Looked to me like
you cut it close.

166
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,083
Sure. Well, if we'd
dominated from the start,

167
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,041
it would've been boring.

168
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,958
So it was all for show?

169
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,500
Anyway, why don't we head
back home and celebrate?

170
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,875
[KIRIHA] Since when was
it your home? It's mine.

171
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,666
[KUKURI] If it's not mine,
it ain't yours.

172
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,333
[BOTH gasp]

173
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,000
[BOTH]
Kazuya!

174
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,125
[KAZUYA, SUNAO]
Tsugumomo.

175
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,666
[ALL]
Tsugumomo!

176
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,083
[KIRIHA, KUKURI groan]

177
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:08,500
[KAZUYA groans]

178
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:12,791
Oh. I guess that would
explain why Kazuya passed out.

179
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,708
Aye. Its the price of
using Divine Possession.

180
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,916
When a tsukumogami and its
wielder truly become one,

181
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,833
they gain access
to far more power

182
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:25,125
than they had as
allied individuals.

183
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,541
Actually, they gain too much
power for a human to wield.

184
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,500
Not without putting
a proportionate strain

185
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,875
on the body.

186
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,958
[KUKURI] You barely even did
it for a minute though.

187
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:37,291
Is he actually hurt,
or just tuckered out?

188
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,791
I don't suppose you know
how long till he recovers?

189
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,291
I can't say for sure,

190
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,291
but I'd like to think that he
just needs a lengthy nap.

191
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,416
Still, though.
Talk about dangerous.

192
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,625
[KIRIHA]
Hm?

193
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,500
If the Divine Possession
had worn out before

194
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,208
you could finish off Sunao,

195
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,875
then Kazuya would've passed out
in the middle of the fight.

196
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:57,041
You'd've had to protect
him all by yourself.

197
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,666
I'd've had to surrender
at that point.

198
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,000
My spiritual energy
was quite depleted.

199
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,541
I couldn't project on my own.

200
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,000
[KUKURI]
Huh?!

201
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,541
[KIRIHA] We had tested
out Divine Possession

202
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,791
for a short time
while we were training.

203
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:12,583
But we kept it brief to
avoid any side effects.

204
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:16,000
That fight was the first
time we'd used it seriously.

205
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,333
To be honest,

206
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,750
I didn't think it would
take that much out of him.

207
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,958
Sounds like one of those
techniques you can only pull out

208
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,500
when you're sure
you'll win with it.

209
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,333
Bet it's nice to have as
a last resort though.

210
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:28,916
[KASUMI] Hey! Dinner's ready
when you are!

211
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,666
[KUKURI]
Kazuya! Hungry?

212
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,208
Say, "Ahh!"

213
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,666
Ahh...

214
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,625
Good boy. What would
you like a bite of next?

215
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,375
Let's see. How about the salad?

216
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,125
[KUKURI]
Sure! Ahh!

217
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,666
Wait a second. Why does
he need help eating?

218
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,833
[KIRIHA] It's nothing.
He'll be fine in a few days.

219
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:51,583
[gasps]

220
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,083
[KASUMI]
Don't tell me.

221
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,500
They forced my Kazuya into a
dark room and subjected him

222
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,541
to such harsh treatment that
he can't stand on his own now?

223
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,750
This is dire. But perhaps
I could be the one

224
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,500
to heal his injured
heart and body.

225
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,458
Does everything
taste good, Kazuya?

226
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,875
You sure are enjoying this.

227
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,208
Huh? What do you mean?
I'm just being nice!

228
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,750
I'm definitely not imagining us
as newly weds right now,

229
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,083
that'd be crazy.

230
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,625
Tell you what, Kukuri.

231
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,625
Why don't I show you some other
ways you can be of service?

232
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:20,916
Uh. Sure. I'd be happy
to help him out.

233
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,250
Uh! I want to help, but...
Not like this!

234
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,333
Huh?

235
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,375
[KAZUYA grunts]
I'm fine, Kiriha.

236
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,958
It's not gonna hurt anything
if I skip a single bath.

237
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,083
That's nonsense. You worked
up quite the sweat today.

238
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,416
[KUKURI gasps]

239
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,125
And Kukuri here has
offered to help you because

240
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,041
she wants to prove what a
caring god she can be.

241
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,625
Well, of course I wanna do my
part, but this is embarrassing.

242
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:49,125
Surely there's some way I
can help that isn't so, uh...

243
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,416
...intimate.

244
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,166
Sure. I have the
perfect compromise.

245
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,208
[KUKURI]
Huh?

246
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,208
[KIRIHA] Sorry for the wait,
but we're here now.

247
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,791
You can relax.

248
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,208
[KAZUYA] Yeah. I'm not
too sure how you expect me

249
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,041
to do that, considering.

250
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:10,750
[KIRIHA] Aw, you're displeased?
Well, it's all Kukuri's fault.

251
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:14,208
[KUKURI] Uh...! Sorry 'bout
this, Kazuya. I...

252
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,583
...just get
embarrassed sometimes.

253
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,583
[KAZUYA gasps] Oh, no.
It's not your fault, Kukuri.

254
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:19,583
[KIRIHA]
Here you are.

255
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:20,625
[KUKURI]
Thanks.

256
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,250
[KIRIHA]
Now, turn this way.

257
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,000
[KAZUYA] Hey! You're rubbing
against my face.

258
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,625
[KIRIHA] So what if I am?
It's crowded in here.

259
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,958
[KUKURI] Kay, I'm gonna
start washin' ya now.

260
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:33,041
Right. Well, thanks again
for doing this.

261
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,833
[KIRIHA chuckles] Goodness.
You must feel pretty high and

262
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:43,666
mighty making a local
god wash your back.

263
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,375
She's got a point, Kazuya.

264
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,333
[KAZUYA] No. Kiriha's the one
who came up with all this.

265
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,500
Kukuri, you can stop if
you're uncomfortable.

266
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,250
No. I'm good.

267
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,666
You did a downright fine
job today, you deserve this.

268
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,250
[KIRIHA]
You done back there?

269
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:05,125
Yup! Go ahead and
turn him this way.

270
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,958
[KIRIHA]
Sure...

271
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:10,583
[KUKURI hums]

272
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,958
[gasps]

273
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,500
[KAZUYA gasps]

274
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:19,333
What's the hold up? Go ahead
and start your scrubbing.

275
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,250
Wash that dick.

276
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,916
How can you just
blurt it out?

277
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,750
Hold on, you don't
have to do that part!

278
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,041
I can wash it myself once
I'm able to move again.

279
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:29,333
Hush, you. That's the part
that needs washing the most.

280
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,791
[KUKURI] I can
do this. I have to.

281
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,541
After all, the only reason
Kazuya even needs help is

282
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:38,041
because I made him become
a malison cleanser.

283
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,708
He's always tending to
our needs, and what's more...

284
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,708
...soon enough, he may well
be tending to my needs

285
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,083
on a fairly regular basis.

286
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:50,333
Fine! I said I'd clean him,
so clean him I will!

287
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,666
Brace yourself!

288
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,125
Hang on a minute.
Actually, I need like five-- No!

289
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,583
Huh. It appears to be
ready for battle.

290
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:03,750
Indeed.

291
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,083
It's not fair.

292
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,500
You had my face right
there and you were naked,

293
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,041
and she was washing me.

294
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,625
--[KUKURI] En garde!
--[KAZUYA] No! Wait!

295
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,125
You don't have to do this! I--

296
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,250
[KAZUYA screams]

297
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,416

298

[KUKURI snores]

299
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,625
That blasted Kukuri.

300
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,875
How's she to take care
of you if she's asleep?

301
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,750
[KAZUYA chuckles]

302
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:36,875
Alright, Kazuya. I promised
you a reward if you won.

303
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,500
Yeah, I forgot.

304
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,208
[KIRIHA]
But I did not.

305
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:44,000
[chuckles] Now what kind
of reward should it be?

306
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,166
Uh, chocolate?

307
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,125
[KIRIHA]
Don't be coy with me.

308
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,250
Look, Kukuri's sleeping
right next to us.

309
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,291
[KIRIHA] Forget the goddess.
She's deep in slumber.

310
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,166
But, what if--?

311
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:59,458
Hush. You're not getting out
of this, Kazuya. He, he.

312
