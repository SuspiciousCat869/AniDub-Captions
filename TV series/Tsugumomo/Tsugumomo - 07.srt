Where's the slide?

00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,958
[KUKURI]
Kiriha!

163
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:26,000
Look what they did!
They murdered my new shrine!

164
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,666
What are you rambling about?

165
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,000
[KOKUYOU]
The slide was classified as a

00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,166
playground hazard and bulldozed.

[KAZUYA]
How come?

168
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,291
An irate mother demanded it.

169
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,625
Seems her child was
injured at play.

170
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,458
She swiftly commenced
to threatening a

171
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,958
local city official, until he
agreed to have it destroyed.

[KIRIHA]
Was it that brat from before?

I do recall him
skinning his knee.

[KUKURI whimpers] Where am I
supposed to sleep, Kiriha?

You'll be fine.
I'll make arrangements.

I've told you before, buster.

We can't have pets here.
No exceptions.

Yeah, they're not pets though.

You sleep like
an animal, Kiriha.

And wear as much underwear.

Tell me when you're satisfied.

[KAZUYA shouts]
I'm sorry...!

I didn't mean to! I thought
the bathroom was empty!

[KOKUYOU]
Fear not, young man.

195
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,583
I've come to realize that
my chest is somewhat

196
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,416
coveted among men.
You've done much for us.

197

I'm grateful.

[KAZUYA shouts]

can repay that debt,

Why are you two in my house?

Oh yeah. Last night.

205

Their home collapsed in a storm.

206
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,708
They need somewhere to
sleep while they fix it.

Kazuya.

208

Do you know what providing
for two people entails?

209
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,458
This household is
full enough as it is.

Dad's right.

211
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,458
I would do almost anything for
you, but even I have my limits.

I mean... how could any caring
sister let her brother share

a roof with a dynamite
rack like that?!

you can't take them?

is why the cards say
