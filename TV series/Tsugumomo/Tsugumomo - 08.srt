To the best of my knowledge,

no girl has ever had eyes
for our esteemed Shirou.

00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,500
Strange that he would
become so popular overnight.

00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,333
I highly doubt this phenomenon
has a natural cause.

[KIRIHA]
Correct! It's supernatural!

169
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,541
This is certainly the
work of an amasogi.

Come on, Kiriha! I asked
you to stay in the bag.

[KIRIHA] How would anyone
notice me amidst this commotion?

175
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,375
We checked the
malison forecast.

176
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,666
It indicated that we were in
for some denser malison

over the next few days.

So I was expecting something
like this to come up.

Now, Kazuya,

it's in times like these that
malison cleansers are needed.

the moment. Can't you tell?

I know that you used
some kind of magical tool
