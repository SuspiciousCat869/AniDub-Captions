00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,083
That gives rise to them.

160
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:02,458
So it isn't like the
one that Tadata made?

161
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,041
[KIRIHA]
Not exactly. Tadata was alive,

162
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,000
and that hair was but a wig.

163
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:11,125
His was what you might
call a pseudo-kamioni.

164
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,041
This is still
an amasogi, right?

165
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,375
So doesn't it need a
living host to exist?

166
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,333
Yes, it does. A living
human with a wish

167
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,875
that resonates with
the regrets of the dead.

168
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,458
So if we exorcise this
monster ourselves,

169
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,625
someone'll face a
malison atonement.

170
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:29,916
That's right. But this kamioni
must have an objective.

171
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,208
And if that turns
out to be revenge,

172
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,916
then we'll have to
thwart it somehow.

173
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,750
I'm sure you're listening.
Get up, Yuu. We need help.

174
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,625
Tell us anything and
everything you know.

175
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,083
Alright.

176
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,791
[KOSAKABE] We were just a
bunch of dumb freshman.

177
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:53,000
There was this boy in our
class and he was really cute.

178
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,416
We all bonded
over liking him.

179
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,541
That's how the Yuuichi
fan club started.

180
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,125
We got along on
the understanding

181
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,541
that we'd share him. All of us.

182
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:07,541
But then, Yuuichi actually
took an interest in Eiko.

183
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,041
Things got awkward after that.

184
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,916
[KOSAKABE] It was too
much for me, so I left.

185
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,500
I can't say for sure, but I got
the impression that they

186
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,625
started bullying
Eiko pretty badly.

187
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,916
Sakumi was the
group's leader.

188
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,625
[KOSAKABE]
Actually, I heard that she was

189
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,000
the first person to
see Eiko's body.

190
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:38,291
We should track down the whole
fan club. Especially Sakumi.

191
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,416
By the way, I think we
should assume that

192
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,541
the amasogi's
looking for them too.

193
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,916
Nanako said she would try and
help us warn them about that.

194
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,458
[knocking]

195
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,750
[ALL]
Huh?

196
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:50,291
[TADATA]
Come in.

197
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,750
[SECRETARY A]
Excuse me, sir.

198
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,833
I have the details you
requested on Eiko Nago.

199
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,583
[TADATA] You have my thanks.
What'd you find?

200
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,625
Well not only did
she have a sister,

201
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,333
her sister is actually
enrolled at this school now.

202
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,375
That's peculiar. I'm fairly
certain that I have

203
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,166
the current student
roster memorized.

204
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,708
There's no Nago in it.

205
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,208
Yeah that's the thing.

206
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,708
Her parents got divorced,
so her surname is different now.

207
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,291
Here's her profile.

208
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,625
[TADATA gasps]

209
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:24,583
[KIRIHA] Hurry, Kazuya.
Weave it just like I described.

210
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,541
I'll try. Obi wheels?

211
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,000
[KAZUYA yelps]

212
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:39,916
[SAKUMI screams, whimpers]

213
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,916
[NANAKO]
Tsugumomo!

214
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,666
[EIKO]
Tsugumomo.

215
00:11:57,166 --> 00:12:01,666
[SAKUMI whimpers]
Please. Don't hurt me.

216
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,791
[screams, grunts]

217
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,833
[EIKO]
Where is the letter?

218
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:11,166
I-I don't know. I never
saw a suicide note!

219
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,541
[KAZUYA]
Let her go!

220
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:15,875
[SAKUMI gasps]

221
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:23,958
We made it just in time.
I know you're here, Nanako!

222
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,333
I know your last name
used to be Nago.

223
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,166
And I know what you're doing.

224
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,833
You're trying to find out what
happened to your sister, right?

225
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,666
[NANAKO]
Glad you understand.

226
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,583
You could've killed someone.

227
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,875
I don't think that the
ghost would've killed her.

228
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,125
No one else knows
where the note is.

229
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:52,541
[NANAKO] I wanted so badly to
know why. Why she jumped.

230
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:56,875
So when a lock of her
hair took on her form,

231
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,791
I felt like she sent it
to help me find the truth.

232
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:03,125
[KIRIHA] Strange. If it has
access to Eiko's memories,

233
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,000
the kamioni should know
why she killed herself.

234
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,500
We've seen it speak.
Why wouldn't it just tell her?

235
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,208
Any ideas?

236
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,208
[KIRIHA] Nothing specific.
But there may be another link

237
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:17,000
between the sisters'
wishes and regrets.

238
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:20,000
Nanako. So, what's all
this talk about a letter?

239
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,166
It's all this mindless
husk will say.

240
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,166
The key to finding out
what she was thinking.

241
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,000
Sakumi.

242
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,291
[gasps]

243
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,208
[NANAKO] All it asked you
about was a letter.

244
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,375
You called it a suicide
note on your own.

245
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,458
[gasps]

246
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:33,750
[NANAKO]
Just tell me where you hid it.

247
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,333
Why would you...

248
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:40,458
[whimpers] I just wanted
them to get together, okay?

249
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,416
He really liked her.
It was obvious.

250
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,416
But she didn't
want to betray us.

251
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,000
So, she started avoiding him,
despite herself.

252
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:52,083
We only messed with her
so she'd leave the club.

253
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,416
At least, that's what
we told ourselves.

254
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,166
Honestly, we did it out
of jealousy. I'm sorry.

255
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,916
So you bullied her. Is that the
reason why my sister's dead?

256
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That can't be true! The day
she died, we all talked.

257
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,666
She really let us have it.

258
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,166
Said everything she'd
been bottling up before.

259
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,208
She seemed different. Stronger.

260
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:19,541
She told us she was gonna tell
Yuuichi how she felt and left.

261
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,583
Later, when school let out,

262
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,666
I saw her heading
towards the roof.

263
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,541
After a minute. I decided to
follow her up and apologize.

264
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:33,291
[SAKUMI] All that she'd left
were her shoes and a note.

265
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,958
A suicide note.

266
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,916
Why did you hide it, Sakumi?

267
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,916
[SAKUMI] Why wouldn't I?
Come on. Think about it.

268
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,333
If she'd named the fan club as
the reason why she jumped,

269
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,000
it would've ruined our lives.

270
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:49,166
I was scared, okay?
I never read it.

271
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,958
I couldn't bring myself to.

272
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,083
You didn't destroy it, did you?

273
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:57,708
[SAKUMI] No. I kept it hidden.
I'll go get it right now.

274
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,583
[NANAKO] "Nanako. By the
time you read this,

275
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,166
I'll already be gone."

276
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,375
[EIKO] But you should know that
there's no reason to mourn me.

277
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,333
I try to seem nice
and stay quiet.

278
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,916
But inside, I'm a
horrible person.

279
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,208
My thoughts are rotten. And on
top of that, I'm a coward.

280
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,583
I couldn't ask out
the boy I liked.

281
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,458
When my friends became bullies,
I couldn't stand up to them.

282
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:29,125
I was too weak to speak
my feelings, or to act on them.

283
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,541
I was really starting
to hate myself.

284
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,750
And that's when the
growth first appeared.

285
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:39,708
It got bigger and uglier
with each passing day.

286
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,333
Until it started to
look like a face.

287
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:47,791
[EIKO] I was too scared and
revolted to tell anyone.

288
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,458
I decided just to
hide it. But then...

289
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,125
[BOY C] What do you mean,
you didn't do it?

290
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,333
[EIKO]
I'm sorry.

291
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,000
[BOY C] That essay's two
thirds of our grade!

292
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,250
[EIKO]
I'm sor--

293
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,833
[EIKO'S GROWTH] Cry me
a river, you lazy jerk!

294
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,375
You gave yourself the easy job
and dumped a team's work on me!

295
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,208
You want an essay?
Write it yourself.

296
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,583
[EIKO] Those dark
thoughts I held inside?

297
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,041
The growth said them for me.

298
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,250
It taught me to speak frankly.

299
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,708
To stop caring what
people might think.

300
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:15,958
And strangely enough,
that helped me make friends.

301
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,916
The growth told me
that it would go away

302
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,416
once my wish was fulfilled.

303
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,250
I thought there was only one
thing that wish could be.

304
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,583
To tell Yuuichi
that I liked him.

305
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,166
[EIKO]
He said he'd go out with me.

306
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,208
I felt like I could fly.

307
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:37,000
But the growth said that my
wish wasn't granted yet.

308
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,625
That there was someone
who would steal Yuuichi

309
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,958
if it didn't stop them.

310
