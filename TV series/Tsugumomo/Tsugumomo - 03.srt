[KOKUYOU] You are
Kazuya Kagami, yes?

6
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,333
Yeah, no, that isn't me.

7
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,750
But you look just like him.

8
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,416
[SHIROU]
In what world?

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,291
[KOKUYOU] Well, it seems I
have no business with you.

10
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,291
Actually, I think
I can help you!

11
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:39,541
[SHIROU] I can't let a
chance like this slip by!

Explain.
My time is limited.

13
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:46,041
Well, see... Me and him just
happen to be best buddies.

14
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:50,291
Truly? Take me to
him immediately.

15
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:55,375
Yeah, no prob, but, uh,
if I do that for you...

[KIRIHA]
I know.

00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,958
[WOMAN'S VOICE] I'll seal
away all his memories

of this incident, along
with the excess energy.

00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,583
That ought to stabilize him.

[KIRIHA]
Then do it, please!

[WOMAN'S VOICE] I will,

of trouble thanks to you!

Damn you, Kazuya.

Ya coulda told me you knew
a bombshell like this.

61

Even if she's a little...

62
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:43,291
Eh, scratch the little,
she is weird. But damn...

63
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:47,833
She can afford to be.
Those are some double dangs.

64
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,500
[KOKUYOU] And you're
footing the bill?

65
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,958
Oh, yeah.
Get whatever you want.

00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,083
Have you decided what
you'd like to get yet?

67
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,375
Let's see...

68
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,375
I'd like to have the
sixteen ounce sirloin steak.

69
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,500
That is an excellent
choice, ma'am.

and the tomato garlic sauces.

you can have them both?

About the bill, sir.

Not only did they take
every penny I had...

102
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,500
I also had to get
a loan from Osamu!

It's no big deal.

I've got your back, pal!

...was subjected to a summer
of doujinshi creation hell.

How come?
What did she want?

[GIRL'S VOICE] Yeah, well,
sorry doesn't cut it, missy.

118
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,750
As of late,
I've had nothing to eat

119
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:38,541
but edible grass and mayonnaise.
I've eaten frogs, snakes,

120
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,000
and rats for protein,
but only rarely.

121
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:45,875
Thus, the promise of such a
feast was too much to resist.

122
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,625
I'd prefer to live off
donations to the shrine.

If its deity were
notable enough to be

124
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,583
in the Kojiki Records,
perhaps there would be some.

[KOKUYOU] Hmm? Might
you be hearing things?

00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:00,333
Please tell me this
isn't something you di--

157
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:01,166
I'm very sorry.

158
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,333
[KIRIHA]
Better be.

159
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,708
This is really weird.
Could it be an Amasogi?

160
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,041
I doubt it.
Was probably just a thief.

161
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:11,500
[KIRIHA] But how could a human
consume the lunches of so many?

162
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,958
I seek Kazuya Kagami!

163
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,666
[OSAMU, KAZUYA, CHISATO]
Wow.

164
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,416
[SHIROU screams]

165
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,250
[SHIROU] There she is!
The bottomless stomach!

166
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,583
And who might you be?

167
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,833
[SHIROU] The guy who paid
for your meal yesterday!

168
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,708
Pay me back!
Or let me touch the ladies.

169
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,625
[KOKUYOU] Oh, yes.
You were most generous.

170
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,375
It was you who
offered to pay, no?

171
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,833
Not for every dish
on the menu!

172
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,416
I'll be working
that off all year!

173
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,208
I am most sorry to hear that.

174
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,666
But I have no money.
Come and rub them.

175
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,833
Heh! That's what I thought.
No point in calling the cops;

176
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,166
you'll just talk
your way out of--

177
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,666
[KOKUYOU] But I have no money.
Come and rub them.

178
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,333
--[SHIROU screams]
--[CHISATO] No, you don't!

179
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,791
[KOKUYOU]
That settles that.

180
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,875
Kazuya Kagami. I've been
sent here to fetch you.

181
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:56,875
I...

182
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,541
[KIRIHA]
I think not!

183
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:03,291
Why should I allow you to
run off with my servant?

184
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:06,041
You promised you wouldn't
come out of my bag!

185
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:10,000
You are a lowly tsukumogami.
Don't oppose my master.

186
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,583
[KIRIHA] Hmph. I see that she
failed to teach you any manners.

187
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,750
I was expressly forbidden
from letting you come.

188
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,833
Begone, washcloth girl.

189
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,333
Oh, no... you did not.

190
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:26,458
We have no need of you.
So be on your way.

191
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:29,291
[KIRIHA] Kukuri's dog
dares to bark at me?

192
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,208
Come at me, you damn ogress!

193
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,791
[KAZUYA] Let's handle
this calmly, okay?

194
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,708
[KIRIHA]
Unhand me, Kazuya!

195
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,041
--[KIRIKA grunts]
--[KAZUYA yelps]

196
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,500
Have you lost your nerve?

197
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:38,708
Say what?

198
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,666
Take it easy--if you use
your powers in here,

199
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,375
you'll tear down
half the school!

200
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,625
[KIRIHA growls]

201
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,458
I know.

202
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,000
You, with the demon teats.

203
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,125
What is it, washcloth girl?

204
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:55,250
We can settle this dispute...
with a bout of arm-wrestling.

205
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,375
Very well.

206
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,166
[KAZUYA]
Uh...

207
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,791
[indistinct murmurs]

208
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,916
[KOKUYOU] I fail to see why the
wardrobe change was required.

209
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,291
Those are official
arm-wrestling uniforms!

210
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,166
So it was your idea.

211
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,291
[CHISATO] I can't believe
you're still at it!

212
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,916
Kay. So it'll be a
single round match.

213
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,916
If Kiriha wins, she comes
with us to the shrine.

214
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,916
If she loses, then she
has to stay here.

215
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Can't help but notice that I
have to go there either way.

216
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,083
--[KIRIHA] Kazuya.
--[KAZUYA] Hm?

217
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,166
A small task. Move this desk;
it's in our way.

218
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,916
[KAZUYA]
Eh?

219
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,291
[KIRIHA]
We may use but one arm,

220
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:35,166
and must keep both feet
planted at all times.

221
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,458
Whoever can connect with a clean
blow to the face is victorious.

222
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,958
If I should triumph, you will
take me to your master.

223
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,750
[KOKUYOU]
I accept.

224
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,000
[KAZUYA] Uh, I thought
you were arm-wrestling.

225
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:53,416
This is arm-wrestling.
We're doing it our way.

226
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:06,666
[KIRIHA, KOKUYOU

Hey, kids!
What's going on out here?

233
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,625
Lunch break ended
ten minutes ago.

234
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:43,000
Sorry, sir. We got caught up
in an arm-wrestling match.

235
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,958
[TEACHER] Arm-wrestling?
What are you talking about?

236
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,458
[SHIROU]
Uh...?

237
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,291
Huh...

238
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,916
[KOKUYOU]
I've given my word.

239
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,291
Follow if you must,
washcloth girl.

240
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,375
[KIRIHA] Call me that again,
and I will tear you asunder.

241
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,916
[CHISATO] There goes my
perfect attendance record.

242
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,291
I'm surprised you came.

243
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:09,041
I really had no idea that there
was a shrine on this mountain.

244
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:13,541
None of the locals do.
Hence the state of it.

245
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:17,250
[KAZUYA] I don't think
I've ever been here, but...

246
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:21,208
it feels like I've seen
all this before.

247
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:25,250
[KOKUYOU] Here we are.
Welcome to Hakusan Shrine.

248
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,291
[KAZUYA, CHISATO gasp]

249
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,041

with her presence.

[KIRIHA] Against a
porcelain Amasogi,

256
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,083
I'm not sure silk will suffice.

257
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:26,083
You could call upon
a hammer tsukumogami.

258
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,791
No way--we've got this!
Let's get to work, Kiriha!

259
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,541
[KANAKA laughs]

260
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,750
[KUKURI] Behold the incarnation
of Hakusan-Myouri.

261
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,041
Kukuri-hime no Ookami.

262
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:47,666
All right. So, is she the
goddess of the shrine, then?

263
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,166
She's wearing a Noh mask,
like from a play.

264
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,666
Someone wants to
seem impressive.

265
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,000
Come, Kukuri. We're reunited
after all of this time,

266
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,791
and you hide your
face like a leper?

267
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,791
[KOKUYOU gasps]
You shut your mouth!

268
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:04,666
[KUKURI] I only recall asking
for Kazuya to join us today.

269
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,083
[KOKUYOU]
Apologies, ma'am.

270
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,708
I was challenged by
the washcloth girl.

271
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,333
[KIRIHA] Yeah, and I
put her in her place!

272
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,833
[KOKUYOU]
You barely won.

273
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,583
[KUKURI]
Arm-wrestling, was it?

274
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:17,083
I see that time has not
dulled your skills, Kiriha.

275
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:22,500
What'd you expect? I still lead
you 125 wins to 123 losses.

276
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,708
So what chance would your
disciple have against me?

277
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,208
[KUKURI] Perhaps your
mind has grown frail

278
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,666
in lieu of your body.

279
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:35,500
The true record is 124 wins,
123 losses, and one draw.

280
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:36,666
To my advantage.

281
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,833
Huh?! Sounds to me
like you've gone senile!

282
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,166
And what is this draw
you're talking about?

283
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,750
[KUKURI] Do you not recall
the battle we called off

284
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,166
due to heavy rain?

285
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,958
[KIRIHA] You created that
drizzle in order to dodge

286
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,375
an imminent loss!

287
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,041
[KUKURI] Even if that were true,
you would not have had

288
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,625
more wins than me!
We'd be tied!

289
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,916
What are you, the goddess
of alternative facts?

290
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,166
[KUKURI] Curb your tongue,
you washcloth youkai.

291
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,791
Excuse me. Can we move
this along, please?

292
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,916
[KUKURI] Ah--? Y-Yes,
I summoned you beca--

293
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,375
[KIRIHA]
Hold, before that.

294
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,500
The seal was meant to last
until he had fully matured.

295
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,500
Why'd it break so quickly?

296
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,208
Between that and
the malison levels,

297
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,541
something must be at work here.

298
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,833
[KUKURI] I admit,
the seal has weakened,

299
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,166
but it is not broken completely.

300
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:22,333
His memories of the truth are
still blocked off, correct?

301
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:26,291
[KIRIHA] Yes, but still,
this is untenable.

302
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:31,208
You must reapply the seal.
Bring the malison under control.

303
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,416
[KUKURI] I cannot do that.
Certainly not right now.

304
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,916
[KIRIHA]
What?

305
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,041
[KUKURI] However, there is
another option. Kazuya Kagami.

306
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,583
Yes?

307
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,291
[KUKURI] You shall exorcise
the anomalies in this region.

308
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:48,416
I call upon you...
to become a malison cleanser.

309
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,833
Malison cleanser...
Why me? Why not Kiriha?

310
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,750
I won't allow it!
Cease this sadistic joke.

311
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,291
If the malison
is out of balance,

312
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,166
you should send your
priestess to deal with it!

313
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,500
[KUKURI]
This is no jest.

314
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,333
[KIRIHA gasps]

315
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,541
[KUKURI] Tell me, Kazuya.
Over the past several days,

316
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:09,833
you've been party to a number
of strange occurrences, yes?

317
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,250
I have.

318
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,458
[KUKURI] These are
isolated events.

319
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:17,041
These aberrations can
only be found around you.

320
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,333
Do you know why that is?

321
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,958
I don't.

322
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,875
That's enough, Kukuri!

323
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,875
[KUKURI] It is because you are a
beacon that malison is drawn to.

324
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,875
[KAZUYA gasps]

325
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,916
[KUKURI] Wherever you go,
malison will follow.

326
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Simply by living, you endanger
the people around you.

327
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,500
[KAZUYA shudders]

328
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,083
[KUKURI] Who better to deal
with the otherworldly threat

329
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:43,291
of malison than the one who
summoned it? Logical, yes?

330
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,083
[KAZUYA]
Uh...

331
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,625
[KIRIHA]
Ignore her, Kazuya!

332
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:50,166
That lying serpent is just
trying to control you.

333
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,750
We're leaving!

334
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,458
A barrier.

335
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,333
[KUKURI] This is
hallowed ground.

336
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:06,208
You shall not leave until I feel
that this matter is resolved.

337
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,416
[KIRIHA]
Uh--!

338
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,708
[KUKURI] Are you resolute
in your answer?

339
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,833
Yes, I am. Now let us out
of here before I get angry.

340
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,083
[KAZUYA]
Uh...

341
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,083
[KUKURI]
Then I have no choice.

342
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,166
[KIRIHA grunts]

343
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,125
[KUKURI] He is
the seed of calamity.

344
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,291
If he can't be controlled,
he must be slain.

345
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,166
--[KOKUYOU] Pardon.
--[CHISATO yelps]

346
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,291
--[CHISATO yells]
--Chisato!

347
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,125
[CHISATO screams]

348
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,083
So you're taking
hostages now?

349
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:38,291
[KUKURI] I simply moved a
bystander from harm's way.

350
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,250
I will ask once more.

351
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,500
Will you accept the duty
of cleansing the malison?

352
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,000
I... I don't know...

353
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,666
He will not!

354
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,791
[KUKURI] Very well.
You have a right to fight back.

355
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:55,916
Run as you may. Make the most of
your final, fleeting moments.

356
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,583
Tch. Have you lost your mind?

357
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:05,083
[KUKURI] Bear witness
to the power of Kukuri,

358
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,750
the Water Goddess.

359
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,208
Dance for me,
O droplets of water.

360
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,166
[KIRIHA grunts]

361
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,500
[KUKURI]
Water Pressure.

362
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,500
What do we do?

363
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,416
You do nothing! Stay back!

364
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,958
[KUKURI] You know how
this will end, Kiriha.

365
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,833
Damn you.
Double-Woven Shield.

366
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,375
[KUKURI]
Water Spear.

367
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,333
[KIRIHA] She pierced
both layers with ease.

368
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,583
[KIRIHA]
Wing Weave!

369
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:39,583
[KAZUYA screams]

370
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,000
I refuse to play your game!

371
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,583
[KIRIHA grunts, sighs]

372
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:53,250
[KUKURI] A fine attempt,
but misguided.

373
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,291
Kiriha, look!

374
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,875
Hush, lest you
bite your tongue!

375
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,500
[KIRIHA] Nowhere to run.
So be it.

376
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,708
[KIRIHA] The weakening
of the seal... Her refusal

377
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:09,125
to show her face...
There's a chance.

378
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,958
Sledgehammer Weave!

379
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,958
[KUKURI]
Water Curtain.

380
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,000
Greater Strike!

381
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,208
[KUKURI gasps]

382
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:20,125
Right where I want you.
Spiral Weave!

383
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,500
--[KIRIHA gasps]
--[KUKURI] Water Mirage.

384
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,166
Seems you've been bested.

385
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,000
[KIRIHA yelps]

386
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,583
[KAZUYA]
Kiriha!

387
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:33,125
[KUKURI] It was clever of you
to aim for the Noh mask.

388
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,166
As you've clearly
surmised, my power

389
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,583
is tied to it at the moment.

390
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,208
Not that such knowledge
could help you now.

391
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,458
Are you okay?
Talk to me.

392
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,791
[KIRIHA groans]

393
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:49,625
[KIRIHA grunts]

394
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,250
[KAZUYA] You can't
keep fighting.

395
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,666
It's fine--I'll do
what she wants.

396
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,583
[KIRIHA] 
Foolish boy.

397
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,833
Putting yourself in the
line of fire helps nothing.

398
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,458
Be quiet and stay back,
like I said.

399
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:02,875
What about you?

400
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,583
[KUKURI] It's time we
put an end to this game.

401
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,208
[KUKURI]
O noble white mountain peaks.

402
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,416
Gush forth with
a blessed torrent.

403
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,458
Let your fury be known
to the world below.

404
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,750
[KIRIHA] She's using
the full incantation.

405
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,875
[CHISATO gasps]

406
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,208
[KUKURI] By the will
of those whose dominion

407
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,166
is all that swirls...

408
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,125
Water Impact!

409
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,166
[KIRIHA, KAZUYA gasp]

410
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:45,416
[KIRIHA] What now?
How do I stop it?

411
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,958
[KIRIHA grunts]

412
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,583
[KUKURI]
It is done.

413
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:29,458
[KAZUYA]
Kiriha just barely endures

414
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,791
the local god Kukuri's attack.

415
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:34,250
But it's left her too
weak to keep fighting.

416
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,791
I have to help her, but how?

417
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:40,125
<i>Tsugumomo</i> , Chapter 4:
"Trials of the Local God."

418
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,666
Don't miss it!
