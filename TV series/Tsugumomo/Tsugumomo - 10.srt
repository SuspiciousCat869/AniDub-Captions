00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,208
[SUNAO]
Tsugumomo!

163
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,875
[SUNAO]
Tsugumomo.

164
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:29,708
You may not.

165
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,250
[whimpers]

166
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,708
My brother was killed.
You must let me seek vengeance.

167
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,708
Lend me the aid of a
strong tsukumogami.

168
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,125
I don't care if that
monster hurts me.

169
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,083
I don't even care
if it kills me!

170
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,250
[gasps]

171
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,625
[HONOKA] Know your place,
you stupid girl!

172
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,833
Last I checked, you're no
malison cleanser.

173
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,750
Why should I let you take one
of my spirits to your death?

174
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:54,791
This was a foe that
Suou couldn't beat!

175
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:58,666
What makes you think that
you would stand a chance?

176
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,166
Listen... Sunao...

177
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,250
Suou didn't want you to
grow up fighting like he did.

178
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:08,916
He became a malison cleanser
so you wouldn't have to.

179
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,458
He always hoped you'd lead
a normal, peaceful life.

180
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:17,083
He died trying to ensure
that you'd get a chance to.

181
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,416
Try and respect that, Sunao.

182
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,041
The best way you could honor
him is by granting his wish.

183
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,208
Understand?

184
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,250
Uh-oh.

185
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,708
[KOTETSU sobs]

186
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,250
[KOTETSU]
I'm sorry, Suou.

187
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,500
If I'd just been stronger,
then you'd still be here.

188
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,916
--[SUNAO] Hey!
--[KOTETSU] Huh?

189
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,125
[KOTETSU groans]

190
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,500
What the heck did ya
do that for, Sunao?

191
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,166
[SUNAO] That's for
blubbering like a baby

192
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,916
when there's work to do.

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,500
You and me have a
vendetta to fulfill.

194
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,333
[SUNAO] My brother used to
tell me all about about how

195
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:59,166
amazing you were. How he could
always depend on his Kotetsu.

196
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,750
But now he's dead. He's dead
because you were weak.

197
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,958
Because his tool was flawed and
it failed him. You failed him.

198
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,708
I oughta throw you away.

199
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:11,500
I ought to, but I won't.
I'm gonna use you anyway.

200
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,750
You might be a loser,

201
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,166
but at least you know
what's worth dying for.

202
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:23,333
I don't see it. Are you sure
that it went in this direction?

203
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:26,958
[KOTETSU] I'm sorry! But yeah.
It should be nearby.

204
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,333
I guess it ran then.
We'll keep on looking.

205
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,458
We're right by the
border of Kamioka.

206
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,250
They have their own
malison cleanser.

207
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,083
She'll have sensed it by now.

208
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:38,166
What, and she'll kill it first?
I won't allow that!

209
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,791
What do you mean, why not?

210
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:44,250
[gasps] I sense it!
The same presence as before.

211
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,833
[SUNAO grunts]

212
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,625
[SUNAO] The object of
my vendetta's ahead.

213
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,833
It's time to avenge my brother.

214
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:50,583
[gasps]

215
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:51,875
[KANAKA]
Spiral Weave!

216
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,958
[gasps]

217
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,458
[KIRIHA shouts]
Drenched in blood again?

218
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,041
You'd think you'd've learned
how to get a clean kill by now.

219
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,500
Yeah, that's my bad.

220
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:15,166
Haven't had a challenge in
so long, I got carried away.

221
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:20,583
My vendetta... It's gone. Dead.

222
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,041
My brother's killer's
been killed.

223
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:27,791
I was supposed to do it.
But you... you!

224
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,625
[SUNAO shouts]

225
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,708
[KANAKA]
Hey... Hey!

226
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:39,791
Oh. Good, you're still alive.

227
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,166
Hold on. How'd I...?

228
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,583
You got knocked out.
Kiriha is very sorry.

229
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,541
Tell the child you
abused how sorry you are.

230
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:52,083
She charged us from the bushes
brandishing a sword Tsugumomo.

231
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,583
She had this coming.

232
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,541
[KANAKA] Whatever. Hey, she's
not crushing you, is she?

233
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:57,833
No, not really.

234
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,291
That's good.

235
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,625
Now, do you mind if I ask
what this is all about, hun?

236
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,166
[gasps]

237
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,250
[KIRIHA]
You're a damned imbecile.

238
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,791
That monster would've killed you
without batting an eye, kid.

239
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,083
Amateurs, am I right?

240
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:17,875
[KANAKA whimpers]
You poor dear.

241
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,041
You poor, sweet, little thing!

242
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,625
[SUNAO grunts]

243
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:25,291
[SUNAO] You... You killed my
brother's killer before I could.

244
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:30,166
Which means... That you are
now the object of my vendetta!

245
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,166
[KIRIHA]
Eh?

246
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,583
Think about this, kid. Shouldn't
you be grateful to the person

247
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,208
who put an end to your vendetta?

248
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,791
No way! You stole it!

249
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,833
Really? How the hell
does that make sense?

250
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:46,833
Because. Because I-I have to
take vengeance on someone, okay?

251
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,333
It's the only way Suou
can rest in peace!

252
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:52,791
You're my vendetta now!
I'll beat you!

253
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,291
[KANAKA chuckles]
Okay, then!

254
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,541
You can have your
vendetta with me.

255
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,333
I'll take you on
when you're ready.

256
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,958
[SUNAO gasps]

257
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,458
So, yeah, 'til then.

258
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:06,708
[KIRIHA sighs] What possessed
you to fuel her delusions?

259
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,000
I dunno, I felt
bad for her, gee.

260
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:09,958
[KIRIHA groans]

261
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,916
[KANAKA chuckles]

262
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,625
Right!

263
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,458
[SUNAO] I challenged Kanaka
many times after that,

264
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:21,916
but I never stood a
chance of beating her.

265
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,375
To hone my technique,

266
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,333
I enrolled in the malison
cleanser school, Tsuzuraden.

267
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,000
I did well there.

268
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:32,375
But after graduating, I returned
to Kamioka to find Kanaka gone.

269
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,666
And a pathetically
weak boy in her place.

270
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,625
My vendetta was with Kanaka.
But I also admired her greatly.

271
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:42,750
In fact, she was the greatest
teacher I'll ever have.

272
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:46,750
And if anyone is fit to carry
on her legacy, then it's me.

273
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:50,541
[KIRIHA growls] I wouldn't
be so sure if I were you.

274
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,500
Quiet, you insolent tool.

275
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,541
[KIRIHA growls]

276
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,000
Kazuya Kagami.
I've challenged you.

277
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,208
Do you accept?

278
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,625
It would be his pleasure to.
Right, Kazuya?

279
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,541
Get up, Kazuya. Time to train.

280
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:17,750
[KAZUYA]
No thanks.

281
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,791
Huh? What's the matter?

282
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,250
[KAZUYA]
Lots of things.

283
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,916
You plan to let that girl
get away with all she said?

284
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,333
As if I'd let you!

285
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:30,041
[KIRIHA growls]

286
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,458
Explain yourself, now.

287
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,500
Okay.

288
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,541
Tadata lost his hair,
and Nanako lost her voice.

289
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,958
Because of me.
Because I attract malison.

290
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,125
If it weren't for that,
they'd be fine.

291
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:46,041
The world would be better
off if I just disappeared.

292
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,166
So I will.

293
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,208
I'll just stay
in here forever.

294
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,166
[KIRIHA]
Mm?

295
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,583
[KAZUYA]
It's for the best.

296
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:54,791
What of school?

297
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:55,458
[KAZUYA]
Done with it.

298
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,500
And food?

299
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,958
[KAZUYA]
My sister'll bring it to me.

300
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,291
Malison cleansing?

301
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,333
[KAZUYA]
Had enough.

302
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,500
Have you?

303
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,500
You've always said before that
you wish to take responsibility

304
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,666
for the malison you attract.
What changed?

305
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,000
[KAZUYA] Sunao says that
she wants to do it instead.

306
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,125
So let her.

307
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,500
[KIRIHA]
And what'll you do?

308
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,250
Live your life huddled up
in a makeshift cocoon?

309
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,083
Yeah, I will. If that's what's
best for everyone else,

310
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,708
then it's fine by me.

311
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,333
[KIRIHA growls]

312
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,500
Clothes off, now!

313
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,458
[KAZUYA gasps]

314
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,541
[KAZUYA gasps]

315
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,541
[KAZUYA]
Kiriha. What are you doing?

316
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,083
