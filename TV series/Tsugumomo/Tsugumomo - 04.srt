Hm...?

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,708

I didn't realize you could
wield eight obi at once.

13
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:49,541
But doing so has clearly
taken its toll on you.

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,541
[KAZUYA]
Ah! Kiriha! You're tiny now.

15
00:02:56,625 --> 00:03:00,458
[KUKURI] You're in no shape
to block a second Water Impact.

16
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,458
Will you reconsider my offer?

17
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,208
[KIRIHA]
I will not!

Kiriha, I...!

19
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:11,583

battle, then do as she says.

There's no point
if you die, too.

21

What do you mean?

22
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,500
[KUKURI]
O noble white mountain peaks.

23
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's give up now.
It's not so bad.

24
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,625
I just have to do
this malison cleansing.

25
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,041
I refuse.

[KUKURI] Gush forth
with a blessed torrent.

27

But why are you
so against this?

28
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:33,666
Because... it goes against
the reason I'm here.

[KAZUYA] Uh... Who are you?
And where the heck am I?

41
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:20,583
We were fighting this goddess,
and then got engulfed in water.

42
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:25,125
Yup, that Kukuri's Water Impact
is no joke. She's a tough lady.

43
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:28,625
Between you and me, Kiriha
doesn't know when she's beat.

Pickin' a fight with
a water goddess...

She's in way over her head!

[KANAKA]
Wait.

49
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,541
I should go. Gotta get
back to drowning, so...

50
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,791
Just listen. I need
to ask ya for a favor.

51
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,875
What is it?

52
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,625
[KANAKA] 
Save Kiriha for me.

53
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,375
[KAZUYA] You want
me to save her?

54
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,041
What, from that water god?

55
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,625
Not really. See, those two
shouldn't even be fighting

56
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,750
right now. Kiriha's stuck
keeping her end

57
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,166
of a deal she made way back.

58
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,375
What kind of deal? And how
can I get her out of it?

59
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,291
[KANAKA laughs]
Pretty easily.

60
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,791
[KAZUYA]
Uh...

61
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,833
Just get strong! Then you won't
need Kiriha's protection.

62
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,291
You can start
protecting her instead!

63
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,916
But that's completely insane!

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,208

We'll start by teaching you

get out of this predicament.

[KAZUYA]
Eh...?

67
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:29,333
So, I... use her true name, and
wait for an ultimate attack?

68
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:32,166
That's it! Sounds like you
can handle things from here.

69
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,500
Break a leg.

70
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:37,083
[KAZUYA] Wait a sec.
What is Kiriha's true name?

71
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:42,166
You already know it.
Good luck, Kazuya.

You're quite resilient.

But I won't allow you
time to recuperate.

Do your worst, then.

No, hold on! Just change
back into an obi for me.

Let you what?

81
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,625
You're too weak to fight
on your own now, right?

Let me help.

83

be wielded by my servant.

Do you have any idea
what you've done?

you with me.

[KIRIHA] You fool.
Know your place.

[KAZUYA] This is the only way.
You're out of strength.

[KIRIHA]
Uh... Have you a strategy?

98
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,666
I do.

99

[KIRIHA]
Very well.

100
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,250

from desperation.

it's doomed to fail.

[KIRIHA] This attack is
larger than the ones

us directly, we're finished.

An impressive performance.

You came surprisingly close,
but in the end, I am a god.

Now then.

145

Let her go!
Don't hurt Kiriha.

What will you do for me?

Okay. Fine.

I'll be your malison cleanser.

Then please put Kiriha down.

be held to those words.

[KAZUYA] Kiriha!
Are you hurt? Talk to me.

I am fine, but thou art a fool.

Ah...

158
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,416
[KUKURI] Mm. And so,
this matter is settled.

159
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,458
Just as it should have been.

160
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:25,500
I have high hopes for you,
my new malison cleanser.

161
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,041
[KAZUYA]
Ah--!

162
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,958
[KUKURI]
Uh...

163
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,500
[KIRIHA, KAZUYA]
Uh--!

164
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,750
[KIRIHA]
<i>Tsugumomo</i> !

165
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,500
[KUKURI]
This here's <i>Tsugumomo</i> !

166
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:04,208
[KUKURI]
Uh... Uhhh...

167
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:08,500
No! Don't look at me!

168
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,875
[KIRIHA laughs]

169
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,500
You look like a
little brat now! Ha!

170
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,000
[KIRIHA laughs]

171
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,791
[KIRIHA] I knew that was why
you were wearing that mask!

172
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,375
You're as weak as a
newborn babe without it!

173
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,541
[KIRIHA laughs]

174
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,958
You shrank too,
so stop makin' fun of me!

175
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,291
[KIRIHA]
No, no, no.

176
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,375
[KUKURI yelps]

177
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,291
[KIRIHA chuckles]

178
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,583
Hey, give it back.

179
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:33,958
[KIRIHA] Why, so you
can make sport of me

180
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,625
like you did before?

181
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,208
[KUKURI yelps]

182
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,583
[KUKURI] L-Look here. I had a
perfectly good reason for that.

183
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,500
I'm sure you did, Kukuri,
and you can tell me

184
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,958
all about it,
once I've gotten even.

185
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,041
No. You wouldn't.
I'm a goddess, dang it!

186
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,833
You do not want
to incur my wrath!

187
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:54,125
I'll show you wrath!
Take this!

188
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,416
What, you don't like that? Well
then, why don't we try this?

189
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,958
[KUKURI] You're exposing
my unmentionables!

190
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,875
[KIRIHA] Come on.
Just a little more.

191
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,583
Snap, you stupid little brat!

192
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:10,250
If you're to be believed...
then the entire point

193
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,083
of that battle was to
get Kazuya to command me.

194
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:16,875
Darn straight. I was never
actually gonna kill him.

195
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,500
What with my divinity dryin' up,
I was in a real pickle.

196
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,625
A good Tsugumomo wielder
is just what I need.

197
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,250
It's a dangerous gig, though.

198
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,500
So, I knew that you'd
be against him doing it.

199
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,791
The only solution was to
have him become your master.

200
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,750
So, yeah. I gave
him a little nudge

201
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,708
to make sure he'd
have to use ya.

202
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,750
Little more than a nudge,
don't ya think?

203
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,666
[KUKURI] Once you've been
commanded by your true name,

204
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,833
you have to do whatever
you're told to do.

205
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,958
So the only one I had to win
over was Kazuya here!

206
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,583
[KIRIHA groans]

207
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,541
And whaddaya know,
my plan worked.

208
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,708
Now I'm the boss
of both of you.

209
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,541
[KUKURI laughs]

210
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,958
[KIRIHA]
You dirty pest!

211
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,583
[KAZUYA]
Calm down, Kiriha!

212
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,000
[CHISATO]
She's just a kid!

213
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,125
[KUKURI]
I am not! I'm ancient!

214
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,750
Please stop
spinning the goddess.

215
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:08,375
[KUKURI] Don't just ask her!
Do something! Aah!

216
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,750
[KUKURI groans]

217
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,291
There.

218
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,750
Well. My house is this way.

219
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:26,250
Thanks, Chisato. I'll try
to make it up to you later.

220
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:30,250
Sorry about all the trouble,
Chisato. We'll see you tomorrow.

221
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,791
[CHISATO]
Mm.

222
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,958
[KIRIHA]
Mm...

223
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,583
[KAZUYA]
Hey, Kiriha?

224
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,541
[KIRIHA]
Uh?

225
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,791
About this malison
cleanser thing.

226
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:49,500
I know I was kind of
forced into it.

227
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,791
But I still wanna
do a good job.

228
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,041
[KIRIHA]
Mm.

229
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,208
[KAZUYA] So I'm gonna
need your help, okay?

230
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,750
[KIRIHA]
Aye.

231
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,583
[KOKUYOU slurps]

232
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,125
[KUKURI]
Hm.

233
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,750
[KAZUYA] I guess
we should go now.

234
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,458
[KUKURI]
See ya later!

235
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,041
--[KIRIHA] Kukuri.
--[KUKURI] Huh?

236
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:22,666
You can't let it
slip any further.

237
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,333
I've got this.

238
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,333
I wonder. Is this
truly for the best?

239
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:39,083
Couldn't tell ya, but what's
done is done; let's trust him.

240
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,875
[KUKURI sighs]

241
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,458
The bigger problem's
right in front of us.

242
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,000
Indeed.

243
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:54,791
[KOKUYOU] The place is
certainly well ventilated now.

244
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,416
[KUKURI]
No doubt.

245
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:04,000
[KAZUYA] 
Hm. You really did shrink.

246
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,333
[KIRIHA groans]

247
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:10,125
And what if I have!
Who cares? You pissant!

248
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,000
I shan't remain like this
forever, but it will take

249
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,625
some time before
I'm completely restored.

250
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,583
I'd better check and see
if you were injured at all.

251
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,750
Do not treat me
like a child.

252
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:27,375
[KAZUYA] Fine. As long
as you're not hurt.

253
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,125
Are you really
that concerned?

254
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,291
Yeah, of course I'm
worried about you.

255
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:36,666
[KIRIHA] Mm. In that case, you'd
best take a nice, thorough look.

256
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,000
[KAZUYA] Oh, no,
I don't think so.

257
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,250
[KIRIHA sighs]

258
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,125
I guess this is okay.

259
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:47,666
Get over it. You're the one
who wanted to take a look at me.

260
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,208
[KAZUYA sighs]

261
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,666
Eee! Keep scrubbing
right there.

262
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,458
As you command.

263
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,666
[KIRIHA] Your hands
feel enormous.

264
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,041
[KAZUYA] That's only
because you're smaller.

265
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,958
I wonder what else
seems bigger now.

266
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,125
[KAZUYA]
You are such a pervert.

267
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,916
[KIRIHA giggles]

268
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,166
I meant the tub, of course!
It's like a pool in here.

269
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,541
You're splashing
water everywhere.

270
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,208
I'll stop...

271
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,041
[KIRIHA]
Hmm...

272
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,875
[KAZUYA]
Let me wield you.

273
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,625
Spiral Weave! Layered Edge!

274
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,375
[KIRIHA] The eight-layered
Spiral Weave.

275
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,375
That was Kanaka's technique.

276
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,458
[KANAKA]
Say, Kiriha.

277
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,250
[KIRIHA]
Mm?

278
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,625
[KANAKA]
If anything...

279
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,833
Hypothetically, if anything
happened to me...

280
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,750
Would you take care of Kazuya?

281
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,750
[KIRIHA]
Ha! Don't be ridiculous.

282
00:16:56,833 --> 00:17:00,458
You're way too tough
to worry about that.

283
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,208
No, then?

284
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,250
This is an absurd line
of thinking, but fine.

285
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,041
Should you be killed,
I'll keep him safe.

286
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:12,000
[KANAKA]
Kiriha.

287
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,541
Thank you.

288
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,083
[KIRIHA]
Right.

289
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,375
[KIRIHA]
Kazuya.

290
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,875
[KAZUYA]
Ah?

291
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:24,500
[KIRIHA] I'll always
keep... you sa...

292
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,125
[KAZUYA screams]

293
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,500
[KIRIHA sighs]
Such a terrible blunder.

294
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,583
[KAZUYA chuckles]

295
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:39,583
Kazuya. I fear I am done for.

296
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,875
Nah, you're just dizzy.
Too much time in the water.

297
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,500
Pudding. One last
pudding before--

298
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,250
Yeah, I'm not fallin' for it.

299
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,500
Pudding...

300
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,875
[KASUMI]
Huh? Old clothes... of mine?

301
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:00,375
[KAZUYA] Yeah. Just on the off
chance you still have some.

302
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:05,291
Like from when you were a little
less than half your height?

303
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,791
Whatever do you
need them for?

304
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,833
Well, uh...
Ya see, I...

305
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,416
No, it can't be true.

306
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,958
[KAZUYA]
Eh?

307
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,583
[KASUMI]
You haven't...

308
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,791
...discovered that you're
into that sort of thing?

309
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,833
--[KAZUYA] Eh?
--You can't do this to me!

310
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:27,291
You'll find naught but pain
and suffering down that path!

311
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,416
[KASUMI gasps]

312
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,916
[KASUMI] This could
be my last chance.

313
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,083
I must demonstrate the charm
and allure of older women.

314
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:36,166
I must grasp his
heart and squeeze!

315
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,333
Come to me, brother!
I'm ready as always!

316
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,666
[KAZUYA] Never mind. Sorry
to interrupt your cooking.

317
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,083
[KASUMI]
Huh?

318
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,041
[KASUMI screams]

319
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,333
[CHISATO] Old clothes?
I might still have some,

320
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,958
but I doubt I can get
them to you tonight.

321
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,500
[KAZUYA] I figured as much.
Thanks anyway.

322
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,625
[CHISATO]
Yeah, of course.

323
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,916
I'll let you know if
I find something.

324
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,958
That would be great.
I'll see ya later.

325
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,791
Hm. I guess she could wear
some of my old clothes,

326
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,833
if I can find any.

327
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,625
[OSAMU]
I've brought them.

328
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,166
[KAZUYA gasps]

329
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,458
[KAZUYA]
Osamu.

330
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,583
[OSAMU]
The items you requested.

331
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,333
[KAZUYA]
Thanks.

332
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:46,000
Sorry for springing this on you.
I appreciate it.

333
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,166
[OSAMU] You took
me by surprise,

334
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,083
but I won't question why you
might desire such clothes.

335
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,416
That isn't my place, and we
all have our inner shadows

336
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,000
that we keep hidden from
the world, don't we?

337
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,625
[KAZUYA] Please stop.
You have no idea, man.

338
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:08,750
Ah! Well done, Kazuya!
Now give them here.

339
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,500
You've brought
me pudding, yes?

340
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:14,875
Oh, yeah. I did, but that
isn't what I went out for.

341
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:19,041
Here. I borrowed some outfits
that should be around your size.

342
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,666
You can't go out
wearing just my t-shirts,

343
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,500
and I'd feel bad making you stay
in obi form all the time, so...

344
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:29,208
Ha! How considerate!
You're finally starting

345
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:32,833
to think like a servant.
I'm proud of you.

346
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,541
[KIRIHA giggles]

347
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,541
[KIRIHA growls]

348
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,083
[KAZUYA]
Huh?

349
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,458
[KIRIHA]
Kazuya?

350
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,791
[KIRIHA] Of all the
clothes in the world...

351
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,125
[KIRIHA] Why would
you choose...

352
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,625
...these?!

353
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,291
Yeah. I got this
bag from Osamu

354
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,916
and didn't think to look
inside till just now.

355
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,541
This Osamu...
The one with glasses?

356
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,625
What on earth do
you think he is?

357
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,166
Not sure.

358
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,916
He said these were reference
materials for his manga.

359
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,791
I'm not even sure that this
one qualifies as clothing.

360
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,291
It's nothing but string.

361
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,791
Damn it.

362
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:17,166
Well, hopefully at least a few
of these will be wearable.

363
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,333
So, which of these garments
best suits your predilections?

364
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,958
If you truly want
me to wear one,

365
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:25,500
I'm sure we can
work something out.

366
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,083
[KAZUYA]
Nope, I'm good.

367
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,833
[KIRIHA giggles]
There's no need to be coy.

368
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,250
Seriously, please don't do this.

369
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,708
Kazuya.

370
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,791
[KAZUYA]
Hey, Osamu. How goes it?

371
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,750
Did you enjoy
yourself last night?

372
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,583
[KAZUYA]
Huh? Yeah, I...

373
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,750
Ohh! No. N-N...
Look, Osamu.

374
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,416
Th-That w-wa--
Hiss 'n' leer, man.

375
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,208
[CHISATO] What's this
about hissing, Kazuya?

376
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,500
--[KAZUYA] It's nothing.
--[CHISATO] How suspicious.

377
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,166
[KAZUYA]
It really is nothing!

378
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:30,000
[KAZUYA] I've taken on the
position of malison cleanser,

379
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,833
so Kiriha begins to teach
me how to wield an obi.

380
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:36,750
But before I can learn much,
another Amasogi appears.

381
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:41,291
<i>Tsugumomo</i> Chapter 5:
"Training." Don't miss it!
