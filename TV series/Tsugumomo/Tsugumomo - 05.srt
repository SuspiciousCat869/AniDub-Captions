we take on all the weaknesses
that go with that form.

With skin, muscle,
bone, and organs.

which would be fatal to a human

An understanding of distance
is essential in battle.

The obi extends exactly
one jou and one shaku,

that to use one.

away, you coward!

equal to 4.17 meters.

he'll know how far his
own strikes can reach.

Sure. Seems kinda basic.

by a magical being

It came from this sketchbook,

Should the drawing be erased
or torn out of the sketchbook,

the creation will disappear.

like this might happen,

I swapped his sketchbook
out with my own.

Now then, how best to
dispose of your minotaur?

I'm tempted to draw
up a magic girl.

But it's probably best to go the
more straightforward route.

This is check.

How do you mean?

425
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,958
You place a piece of paper over
the drawing you intend to copy.

426
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,375
Then you shine a
light from below,

427
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,000
and draw over the newly
visible lines by hand.

428
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,875
I copied my minotaur
from the art

in one of my tabletop
RPG rulebooks.

Which would explain why
that arm you redrew

431
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:13,250
was so sloppy in comparison
to the rest of the monster.
