1
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:18,791
[KAZUYA] Kept wound and folded,
the obi was like a cocoon,

2
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,208
but when it unfurled,

3
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:25,208
from that vision of white,
a girl emerged.

4
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,583
[KAZUYA gasps]

5
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:36,333
[KAZUYA]
A fairy? A youkai? A ghost?

6
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:39,500
I couldn't have known,
and yet...

7
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:45,000
[KAZUYA] Her scent
was comforting. Familiar.

8
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,333
[NARRATOR] Tsukumogami:
When after many years an object

9
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:55,291
gains a soul and, eventually,
the power to transform.

10
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,458
[KAZUYA]
"The Scent of Cherry Blossoms."

11
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,750
[KAZUYA]
Uh...

12
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,916
[KAZUYA]
Where am I?

13
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:50,416
[KAZUYA]
Ah... Hey. Don't go. Wait.

14
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,791
[KAZUYA]
Don't leave me...

15
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,208
Don't leave me!

16
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,791
[CHISATO]
Hm?

17
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,541
[CHISATO]
Aah...!

18
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:02,791
[CHISATO screams]

19
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,333
[KAZUYA yelps]

20
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,416
Just what kind of dirty
pervert are you? This is how

21
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,500
you thank me for trying to
wake you up from a nightmare?

22
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,125
Man, that hurt.
What'd I do to deserve that?

23
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,541
[CHISATO] I could ask
you the same thing!

24
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:17,958
[KAZUYA]
So white...

25
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,500
[CHISATO] Ugh! You'd think
you'd've gotten your fill

26
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,375
from groping a
classmate's chest!

27
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,291
But apparently, no, you just had
to go for the upskirt peek too!

28
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,875
[SHIROU laughs]

29
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:28,208
She'll probably be shouting at
the poor guy for the next hour.

30
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,375
He's getting a
passionate lecture

31
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,458
from our class representative.

32
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,916
Some of us would
pay for that experience.

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,500
[CHISATO] Every moment in
school is an opportunity,

34
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,583
and you are wasting this one!

35
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,083
[KAZUYA sighs]
And I'm out.

36
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,875
[KAZUYA exhales]

37
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,291
[KAZUYA] Chisato's lectures
feel like they last forever.

38
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,416
[KAZUYA]
That was strange.

39
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:11,583
It's showing up
in my dreams now.

40
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:16,291
This kimono sash, or obi--
it used to belong to my mother.

41
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,541
I don't remember her
all that well,

42
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:22,375
but I've kept it with me
ever since she passed.

43
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:31,208
[KAZUYA] It smells familiar.
Like cherry blossoms.

44
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,916
Better go before
Chisato finds me.

45
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:45,416
[KAZUYA] A wig?
I wonder who left it there.

46
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,458
[KAZUYA yelps]

47
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,666
[KAZUYA]
What the--? Aah!

48
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,583
[CHISATO] Where did
Kazuya run off to?

49
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,916
I was hoping to walk him home.

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,375
[KAZUYA]
Somebody, help!

51
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,500
[KAZUYA yelps]

52
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,291
Lemme go!

53
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,625
[KAZUYA yelps]

54
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,208
What the heck is that thing?

55
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:19,083
[FEMALE VOICE]
An amasogi. You should be wary.

56
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:27,375
[KAZUYA]
Wha...? Am I... falling?

57
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,125
Aw. Guess I'm dead.

58
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,958
[FEMALE VOICE]
Thou art a fool.

59
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,458
It's been a long time, Kazuya.

60
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,083
Who're you?

61
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,500
Why, you... ingrate!

62
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,750
[KAZUYA grunts]

63
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,791
[KAZUYA groans]

64
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,875
[KAZUYA gasps]

65
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,625
Aha. Look who's arrived.

66
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,541
[KAZUYA] Listen, there's
something really dangerous

67
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,666
around here. You need
to run for it, okay?

68
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,041
[KIRIHA] Kazuya.
That person is hosting it.

69
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,666
[KAZUYA yelps]

70
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:47,833
[KAZUYA yells]

71
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,833
Do not covet the
possessions of others.

72
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:55,708
This young man belongs
to me. So back off.

73
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:56,833
[HOST groans]

74
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,208
Why do I belong to you?

75
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,666
I have saved your life
not once, but twice.

76
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,208
Do not complain.

77
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,291
[KAZUYA] So one youkai
wants to kill me,

78
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,958
and the other wants me
for a slave. Great.

79
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,833
[KAZUYA screams]

80
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,916
[KIRIHA] How dare you
call me a youkai?

81
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,083
I am a Tsukomogami!

82
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,750
Yeah, well, I don't
see the difference!

83
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,625
[KIRIHA]
Oh, really?

84
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,083
--Kazuya.
--No!

85
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,875
This is your hour
of reckoning.

86
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,750
Agree to serve me, and I'll
save your wretched life.

87
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,416
Okay, fine, whatever you want!

88
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,083
I'll be your servant, just don't
let this thing kill me!

89
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,416
I accept your offer.

90
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,583
[KAZUYA screams]

91
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,041
Give him back.

92
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,708
[HOST screams]

93
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,333
Not so fast, you strumpet.
Obi strike!

94
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,333
[HOST yells]

95
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,041
And to follow up...
Obi slam!

96
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,666
[HOST grunts]

97
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,458
Ah! That's amazing.

98
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,083
But wait, if you keep that up,
you could kill her!

99
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:57,458
[KIRIHA] Heh. This one shan't
perish quite so easily. See?

100
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:00,458
[HOST breathes heavily]

101
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,125
[HOST yells]

102
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,416
[KIRIHA]
Take this!

103
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,416
[KIRIHA]
Once more!

104
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,333
[KIRIHA] I'm impressed by
the strength of your desire.

105
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,708
But this amasogi...

106
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:35,083
Giving in to its power
shall not grant your wish.

107
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:39,000
Return to your senses,
while my patience endures.

108
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,333
Should you rebuke the amasogi
with your own will,

109
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,125
then the price of your
atonement will be light.

110
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,000
[HOST groans]

111
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:53,500
If I can't have him for
myself... I'll destroy him!

112
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,041
Shield Weave!

113
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,041
Kazuya!

114
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:03,083
No. Don't worry, I'm fine.
It barely grazed me!

115
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,000
[KIRIHA]
You've exhausted my mercy!

116
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:15,000
[HOST gasps]

117
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,250
I shall skewer both you
and your amasogi.

118
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,416
Take this. Spiral weave!

119
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,541
No, don't!

120
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,666
Heh. You owe your life
to Kazuya here.

121
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,500
[KAZUYA] All this trouble
from a wig she was wearing.

122
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,791
So, uh, do you know
why she attacked me?

123
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,583
[KIRIHA] The wig became
possessed by your classmate's

124
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:56,916
feelings for you.
Creating an amasogi.

125
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,500
Amasogi?

126
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,333
[KIRIHA] They're conceived from
strong but primitive desires.

127
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,416
Think of them as
instant Tsukumogamis.

128
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,500
This one was born from
a desire to possess you.

129
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:10,750
You're quite lucky I was around.
Had you been captured,

130
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:14,458
no orifice on your body would
have been spared from its lust.

131
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,458
[KAZUYA]
Didn't need to know that.

132
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,416
Still, I dunno...

133
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,375
It's kinda cool to think that
a girl liked me that much.

134
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,583
[KIRIHA] Small correction.
This one is male.

135
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,833
[KAZUYA]
Uh-- Huh?

136
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,833
Wow. You don't say...

137
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:35,416
Could you tell me anything else
about what just ha... Uh?

138
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,541
[TEACHER]
Hey, kid!

139
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,958
It's way after hours! Why are
you still hanging around here?

140
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,583
[KAZUYA] Sorry, sir! But this
girl fainted, see, so I had to--

141
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,083
[TEACHER]
Eh? What'd you do to her?

142
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,500
[KAZUYA] Nothing, sir!
I found her like this.

143
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,583
[TEACHER] And put
her on your lap?

144
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,375
[KIRIYA]
Hm.

145
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,833
[KAZUYA]
I'm home.

146
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,208
[KASUMI]
Welcome back, Kazuya.

147
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,375
I've drawn a bath.
Ya wanna share it?

148
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,000
No thanks.
I'm not a kid anymore.

149
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,083
[KAZUYA sighs]

150
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:16,333
[KAZUYA] Crazy.
That girl saved my life.

151
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,875
I think I'd remember
if I'd seen her before,

152
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,625
but she certainly knew me.

153
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:27,291
Why'd she take off so fast?
And what was with those powers?

154
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:31,291
What'd she call herself?
A tsukumogami?

155
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,458
"Not a youkai," my foot.

156
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,958
[KAZUYA] After I fell off
the roof, I couldn't find

157
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:45,875
my mom's obi no matter where
I looked. So, that must mean...

158
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,958
[KAZUYA] Hey. Don't go.
Don't leave me!

159
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,000
[KAZUYA gasps]

160
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,625
[KAZUYA pants]

161
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,500
That dream again.

162
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,250
[KAZUYA screams]

163
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,625
[KIRIHA]
<i>Tsugumomo</i> !

164
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,125
[KIRIHA]
This is <i>Tsugumomo</i> !

165
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,583
[KAZUYA screams]

166
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,833
[KASUMI]
Kazuya!

167
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:39,708
Are you okay?

168
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,666
[fight bell rings]

169
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,666
[KASUMI]
Hm?

170
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,291
Yup. Everything's fine here.

171
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,333
Uh... But you just let
out a terrible scream...

172
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,458
[KAZUYA] Oh, well,
that's just cause, uh,

173
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,500
I slipped and fell
a little bit.

174
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,583
[KASUMI]
Oh. Is that all?

175
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,291
[KAZUYA] Yup! Sure is.
You can go now.

176
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,875
[KIRIHA groans]

177
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,291
[KAZUYA sighs]

178
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,125
So, uh...

179
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,125
Imbecile! You have
some nerve,

180
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,916
tossing your savior behind
your bed like dirty laundry!

181
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,583
[KAZUYA] I'm sorry, but I had
to hide you from my sister!

182
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,416
[KIRIKA clears throat]

183
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,041
Offensive though it
obviously is that you have

184
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:24,583
no recollection of me, I shall
graciously explain everything.

185
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,791
First off, I am--

186
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,625
[KAZUYA] A tsukumogami
born from my kimono?

187
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,041
How'd you know?
Has it all come back to you?

188
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:34,291
[KAZUYA] No, just
an educated guess.

189
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,625
[KAZUYA] I mean, a bunch of
cloth sprang out of my backpack

190
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,666
right before you showed up.

191
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,750
[KAZUYA] And then there's
that smell. Cherry blossoms.

192
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,375
[KIRIHA]
Mm?

193
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,541
Plus after you showed up,
the obi sash went missing.

194
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,208
If tsukumogami
come from objects,

195
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,000
then that must be yours.

196
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,750
You're slightly smarter
than I took you for.

197
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:03,500
Indeed. The hand-woven
obi of silk, Ayasakura.

198
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:07,125
I am it's Tsukumogami, Kiriha.

199
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:11,750
Since you are my servant, you
may address me as Lady Kiriha.

200
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:15,750
About that. Listen, Kiriha.

201
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,000
That's wrong. "Lady" Kiriha.

202
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,208
Okay, uh, I don't mean
to seem ungrateful

203
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,500
about the whole saving my
life thing... but, uh...

204
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,583
Given the "circumstances,"
I don't feel like

205
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,791
that deal we
made was valid.

206
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,541
And besides, the obi you were
born from belongs to me,

207
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:34,041
so I think that means
I'm your master.

208
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,041
[KIRIHA growls]

209
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,208
[KAZUYA] I take it back.
I take it all back.

210
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,666
[KIRIHA]
Good. In that case,

211
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,875
it's time for your
first task, my servant.

212
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,000
[KAZUYA]
Geh...

213
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,541
[CLERK]
Good evening!

214
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,583
[GIRL'S VOICE]
Sa-weets!

215
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,041
Are you happy now?

216
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,625
Aah! So much sugar...

217
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:55,833
Mm...!

218
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,416
You forgot the pudding,
you worthless twit!

219
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,000
[KAZUYA groans]

220
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,458
[KIRIHA] When I ask for sweets,
that's included!

221
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,916
[KAZUYA] How was I
supposed to know that?

222
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,333
[KIRIHA] It's assumed!
Apologize to the god of pudding!

223
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,541
[KAZUYA]
I'll go back.

224
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,416
[CLERK]
Good evening.

225
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,208
[GIRL'S VOICE]
Pudding!

226
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,125
[KIRIHA]
Ahh... Mm.

227
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,291
[KIRIKA squeals]

228
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,125
Oh, that's the stuff.

229
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,458
Just delectable!

230
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,666
Pu, pu, pudding!
Pu, pu, pudding!

231
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,583
So, so tasty...

232
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,791
You coulda just asked
for it to begin with.

233
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,958
[KIRIHA]
Ha--mm! Pu, pu, pudding...!

234
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,166
Anyway, I'm gonna go downstairs
and eat dinner. Kay?

235
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,500
Try and keep it down
while you're alone up here.

236
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,583
[KIRIHA]
Aye, you are dismissed.

237
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,291
[KAZUYA]
Thanks for the food.

238
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,125
[KASUMI] Eat your fill.
I made enough for seconds.

239
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,000
[KAZUYA]
Okay.

240
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:52,041
Oh, by the way, Kazuya. You've
been especially noisy today.

241
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,625
Try to rein it in.
You'll bother the neighbors.

242
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:59,750
[KAZUYA] R-Right. Wow, these
boiled veggies are great.

243
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,416
Really? I'm glad you like them!

244
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,750
[KIRIHA laughs]

245
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,000
[KASUMI] Uh-- Did I
just hear laughter?

246
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,791
Yeah, weird, maybe I left
the TV on or something.

247
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,000
[TV VOICE]
I'm seventeen!

248
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,625
[KIRIHA]
Oh, come on!

249
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,583
[KAZUYA] Anyway, how long
till Dad gets back

250
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,375
from his business trip?

251
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,250
Um, a good while.
He's really busy lately.

252
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,625
[KIRIHA yells]

253
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,166
[KASUMI]
Hm?

254
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,250
[KIRIHA] Damn it all!
Stop using the same two attacks!

255
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,250
[KASUMI] You're sure
that no one's up there?

256
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,458
I'm sure this
miso soup is awesome.

257
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:29,958
Ya do something special
with the stock?

258
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:33,291
[KASUMI] What's up with you?
You're acting strange.

259
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,458
Have you finally realized
how attractive I am?

260
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:37,916
Do you wanna marry me now?

261
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,166
I knew this day would come!
I just had to be patient!

262
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,041
[KAZUYA]
I wouldn't go that far...

263
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,291
[ANNOUNCER]
You lose!

264
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,083
[KIRIHA growls]

265
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,541
Worthless lay-about,
always ducking...

266
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,750
Go provide for your family!

267
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:53,125
[KIRIHA sighs] Anything else
of interest around here?

268
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,791
Oh, right.
There is always that.

269
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:04,791
[KAZUYA sighs] I'm turning into
a nervous wreck down here.

270
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,583
Hey, Kiriha?
Could you keep it down?

271
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:13,041
Uh oh. She disappeared.

272
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,750
[KAZUYA] I wonder...
Where would she have gone?

273
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,583
[KASUMI] Go ahead and
take your bath, Kazuya!

274
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,333
Kay, will do.

275
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,458
[KASUMI] I'll join you
in a bit, okay?

276
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,291
Could you just not?

277
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,916
[KAZUYA] Really is strange
that Kiriha took off.

278
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,708
Maybe she's just prowling
for more snacks.

279
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,541
Whatever. As long
as she doesn't

280
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,833
run into my sister
while she's at it.

281
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,541
[KAZUYA]
Mm?

282
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,000
[KIRIHA]
Ah...

283
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,666
[KAZUYA] This could
go three ways. One...

284
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,000
Ew! Get out, you pervert!

285
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,000
--[KAZUYA] Two...
--[KIRIHA] Thought you could

286
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,333
peep on me in
the bath, did you?

287
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,916
[KAZUYA cries]

288
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,916
[KAZUYA] I swear. I didn't know.
I wouldn't have...

289
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,125
[KIRIHA]
Don't just stand there.

290
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,916
Um... What?

291
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You have come to wash my back,
have you not? Get to it.

292
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,416
[KAZUYA]
Option three it is.

293
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,458
[KIRIHA] Ah, that's the spot.
Keep rubbing right there.

294
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,541
[sound of water being poured]

295
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,000
[KIRIHA] Well done.
Now it's your turn. Go on.

296
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,916
[KAZUYA]
Wait... My turn?

297
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,458
You are quite fortunate.

298
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,083
Tonight, you have the honor
to be washed by me.

299
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,333
No thanks, I'm okay.

300
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,500
[KIRIHA] What are you
so embarrassed about?

301
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,166
We used to bathe together
all the time, remember?

302
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,333
No, I don't remember
doing that!

303
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,541
Although, I probably wouldn't...

304
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,500
[KAZUYA sighs]

305
00:18:53,583 --> 00:19:02,541
[KIRIHA hums]

306
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,791
[KAZUYA] She's right.
This feels familiar.

307
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,875
You have certainly
grown, Kazuya.

308
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,125
Back in the day,
you were this little!

309
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,833
Oh, come on,
I was never that tiny.

310
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,208
[KIRIHA]
Your dick was, though.

311
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,750
My, it's grown!
So firm and proud.

312
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,458
My nude form has aroused you!

313
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:30,375
[KAZUYA] No! That just happens
sometimes. Don't look at it.

314
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,708
[KIRIHA] Hmmm.
Still hiding its head

315
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,291
in that hood. Here, allow me.

316
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,541
[KAZUYA]
What are you--? No!

317
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:37,541
[KIRIHA] Don't struggle.
That'll make it worse.

318
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:38,791
[KAZUYA]
Don't! Please!

319
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,541
[KAZUYA screams]

320
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,250
[KAZUYA shudders]

321
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:47,500
'Tis a trivial matter.
Don't be such a ninny.

322
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,083
[KAZUYA] No, it's a
delicate matter involving

323
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,750
an extremely delicate
body part, okay?

324
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,708
[KIRIHA sighs]
None too manly, are you?

325
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,333
[KAZUYA groans]

326
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:59,416
[KIRIHA] My, look at the time.
We'd best head to bed, Kazuya.

327
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,291
Oh, we've got a guest futon
downstairs. I'll go grab it.

328
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,958
Mm? Why would you?

329
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,500
[KAZUYA]
Uh...?

330
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,458
[KAZUYA]
Eh...

331
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
This is so not a good idea.

332
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,125
I'm a boy, you're
sort of a girl...

333
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:21,291
We're not supposed to be...

334
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:26,625
You're speaking nonsense.
We've always slept together, no?

335
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:31,958
[KAZUYA] Huh. When you put it
like that, yeah. This is normal.

336
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,708
[KIRIHA]
It's settled, then.

337
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,333
[KAZUYA] 
She appeared so suddenly.

338
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:51,166
Saved my life, and then started
calling me her servant.

339
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,958
Guess she's made
herself at home now.

340
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:59,625
Funny. I don't actually
mind that. It feels right.

341
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,166
[KAZUYA]
Kiriha sleeping beside me,

342
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,750
with her familiar,
comforting scent.

343
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:21,208
[KAZUYA groans] How am I
supposed to sleep?

344
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:44,625
It would seem the malison
has grown slightly denser.

345
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,750
Shall we take action now?

346
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,458
[GIRL'S VOICE]
Meh. No need to rush.

347
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,166
'Specially not so soon
after the incident.

348
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,291
Just keep on keepin' an eye
on things, for now.

349
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,375
[KAZUYA] My childhood
friend Chisato and I

350
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,916
end up trapped in
the school library.

351
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,083
When we try to figure
out the reason why,

352
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,208
things get even more bizarre.

353
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,875
<i>Tsugumomo</i> Chapter 2:

354
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,333
"The Library and the Childhood
Friend." Don't miss it!
