Come on... That's crazy talk.

3
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,947
[LALA]
No.Think of how many times

4
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:16,049
you've narrowly escaped your
death.

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,417
[KIMIHITO]
Well, yeah but‐

6
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,553
[LALA]
Don't waste your breath. My evil

7
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,656
eye of Balor sees the
fate of every man.

8
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:26,693
I am a Dullahan, a knight
of the underworld.

9
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:29,730
I've come to reap
your soul and take it

[RACHNELA]
No one's laying a finger on my

11
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,168
Honey... except for me, of
course.

12
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:38,772
[LALA]
(grunt)I am death incarnate!

13
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,475
This mortal thread of yours will
never stop his fate‐

14
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:45,378
[RACHNELA]
I'll handle her... You girls
protect Honey.

15
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:50,316
[CEREA]
Ah... Yes, of course! Papi! Take
the master somewhere safe!

Okay!(hup!)

Nice one, Suu!

00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,887
Keep saving him... We need your

More than ever?

Yeah, thanks again,

Darling!

Owwie.‐ I forgot I can't see so
well at night [time].

31
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,233
[CEREA]
Look what you're doing to him!

Oh, I do hope you're alright,

(aagh!)(OM scream)

38
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:01,588
[MIIA/CEREA/MERO]
He really is at death's door!

39
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,694
[KIMIHITO]
Would you guys just relax?...
You're imagining things.

40
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,697
[CEREA]
I'll protect you from anything,
even fate!

41
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:15,669
I thought this might happen, so
I've prepared a saddle for
traveling long distances.

42
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:19,105
[CEREA]
This way, Master and I can run
as far away as necessary!

43
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:24,110
Traditionally, it's a great
dishonor for a knight to flee in
the face of danger...

44
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,348
... but a true knight knows
today's dishonor is tomorrow's
victory!

45
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,885
And if it ensures my Master's
safety, I'll pay the price!

46
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,687
[MIIA]
Wow, Centorea!

[KIMIHITO]
Uhhh...

48
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,322
[MERO]
Running off into the sunset

49
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,792
together is very romantic!...
How touching!

50
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:42,362
[CEREA]
(startled) Well, I'll leave the
rest to you, Miia!

51
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:46,366

(huh?) Hey!... That's no fair!

52

[RACIST GUY] (laughing)Yeeha!
[RACIST GIRL] See how fast we
can go!

00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:55,609
[RACIST GUY]
Good thing this baby's insured!
Whoa, what the hell?!

54
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,411
[CEREA]
You won't die, especially at
THEIR hands!

[KIMIHITO]
(holding on)(land)

56
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,786
[CEREA]
Tarnishing my proud name...
leaving my home...

57
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:10,724
All to preserve my Master's
life! It's honor through
dishonor!

58
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:13,594
This is legendary!

59
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:17,931
The knight and her master travel
far and wide to elude their
pursuers...

60
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:22,903
in search of a place
where they can live in peace...
forever and ever!

61
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:29,242
Then one day...... they realize
an unbreakable bond of love has
been forged between them!

62
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:33,479
(happy)Goodness, I've let myself
get carried away!

[CEREA]
Are... you alright?

67
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,327
[KIMIHITO]
Never been better...

68
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,930
[CEREA]
I don't believe this...
Normally,

69
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,901
I'd never make a
mistake like that. This means
not even I can protect him!

70
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,469
[LALA]
You're right; nobody can.

been...?!

72
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,644
[LALA]
Such a foolish mortal.‐ Just as
you can never escape

73
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,547
the call of
death, neither can you escape
from my sights.

74
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:09,916
[CEREA]
Quick, Master, you must run
away!... Leave this to me!

75
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:14,087
[KIMIHITO]
Listen, can't we talk about
this?(OM yanked, scream)

76
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:19,392
[CEREA]
Mero! Well then, I suppose I can
give you my full attention!

[KIMIHITO]
Agh!... Mero, wait!...

79
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:29,803
Are you trying to
drown me?!‐ I don't have gills
like you do, remember?(hit)

Oh, Master!

81
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:36,977
[KIMIHITO]
(gasp for air)That was a close
one...

82
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:40,614
[MERO]
Master? I'd like to request
something of you.

83
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:43,684
I was thinking, since you're
going to pass away any time now

84
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,786
and there's nothing we can do to
stop it...

85
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:48,421
[KIMIHITO]
You accepted that awful
quickly...

86
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:49,923
[MERO]
I want you to leave behind a

87
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,826
token of our tragic love that I
can treasure forever!

88
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,227
[KIMIHITO]
A token?

89
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,428
[MERO]
Yes!

90
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:58,899
So I can remember you... every
day.

91
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:03,537
[KIMIHITO]
Wait... you mean... OH, haha..
for a second I thought you

92
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,807
wanted me to, uh... I dunno,
make a baby with you or
something

93
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,375
weird like that... But
that would be insane‐

94
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,277
[MERO]
Yes, that's exactly what I want.

95
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:12,613
[KIMIHITO]
(floored)

96
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:15,649
[MERO]
Ah.. a child born after your
death...

97
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,619
Think of it; the idea
is so terribly heartbreaking and

98
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,554
yet it's so inspirational at the
same time!

99
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,456
[KIMIHITO]
Stop assuming I'm gonna
die!(startled)

Please, Master!.. I need you to

fertilize my eggs as soon as
possible!

102
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,830
I'll help you create a legacy
that will live on forever!

[KIMIHITO]
Pull yourself together, tragedy
addict!

104
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:38,204
Listen, Mero! Just because that
girl SAYS I'm at death's door
doesn't mean I‐

105
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:42,042
[MERO]
It's alright, no one can see us
underwater... Are you ready?

106
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:44,477
[KIMIHITO]
Do I LOOK ready to you?!

107
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:46,847
[MERO]
Master... it's time to do it.

108
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:50,551
I'm new at this, so please be
patient with me.

109

[KIMIHITO]
Oh god... I‐I'm blacking
out...(OM look)

110
00:05:56,256 --> 00:06:00,126
[MERO]
P‐pardon me... It's true that
I'm a mermaid...

111
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:03,964
but I can't
breathe underwater... Please let
go...

[MIIA]
Hey!.. Darling!.. Are you okay?
You need to cough up the water!

This is bad... This is really
REALLY bad!

117
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,216
No matter what we do
to help him, we keep putting
Darling's life in danger!

her side!

You girls just don't get it, do
you?

(huh?)

123
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,468

Try as we might, we'll never

124
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,739
save Honey from his fate...
Knowing that...

125
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,442
... wouldn't it be best to go
ahead and put him out of his
misery now?

126
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:52,145
there's no need to delay the
inevitable

127
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:56,349
Dullahan... use that scythe to
do what must be done.

128

Wait!

[RACHNELA]
(hm?)

130
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,353
[MIIA]
Don't take him away from me!

131
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:05,225
If you're gonna kill him now...
then you'll just have to kill me
too!

132
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:08,461
[RACHNELA]
I can tell you're trying your
best to be tough,

133
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,430
but you're
shaking like a fly in a web.

134
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,733
[MIIA]
Sh‐shut up!

135
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,569
I mean, do you guys honestly
expect me to let you do this?...

136
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:21,241
This person just showed up out
of nowhere and now she's going
to take my Darling's life!

137
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,544
And there's nothing I can do!

138
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:30,684
At least let me die too, so we
can be together in heaven.

[MIIA]
Darling!

142
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,223
[KIMIHITO]
Come on...

143
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,059
You seriously believe
I'm gonna die?

144
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,795
[KIMIHITO]
Just because this random girl
said so?

145
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:42,929
[LALA]
(pout)

146
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,197
[RACHNELA]
(hm?)

147
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,468
[KIMIHITO]
(think)(think harder)

148
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,203
[KIMIHITO]
Miia.

149
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,271
[MIIA]
(huh?)

150
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,773
[KIMIHITO]
I'll come back...

151
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:55,441
and when I
do... I'll get married!

152
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:58,211
[MIIA]
(blush)Don't say that!

153
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,213
[MIIA]
That's a death flag!

154
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,416
[KIMIHITO]
Let's split up; we can cover
more ground that way.

155
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:04,951
[MIIA]
Another one?!

156
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,887
[KIMIHITO]
Is it alright if I cross the
finish line now?

157
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,055
[MIIA]
When people say that stuff...

158
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,124
[KIMIHITO]
You mean stuff like, "You don't
mind

159
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,492
if I beat that thing,
right?"

160
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,595
[MIIA]
Yeah, they always die
afterwards!

161
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:17,497
[KIMIHITO] No problem.
Everything's fine. [MIIA] Stop
it!

162
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,266
I'm not afraid of anything
anymore.

163
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,943
Ow.

164
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,778
SATSUKE
My bad!

165
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:34,147
[KIMIHITO]
Are you satisfied now?

166
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,349
[RACHNELA][MIIA]
(confused)

167
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,384
[KIMIHITO]
I'm not about to die.

168
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:39,786
[RACHNELA]
So...

169
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,955
[MIIA]
She's not death incarnate?

170
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,926
[SMITH]
(laugh) What do you think this

171
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,229
is, a horror movie?... She's not
the grim reaper.

172
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,465
[KIMIHITO]
The detachable head's pretty
horrific...

173
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:55,001
[SMITH]
And you! You're never going to

174
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,904
run away like that again...
right...

175
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:58,872
... Lala?

176
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,141
[LALA]
Agh... How dare you address me

177
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,676
by my worldly name?

178
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,611
[RACHNELA][MERO][MIIA][CEREA]
Lala?

179
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,713
[SMITH]
I've been looking all over for
you.

180
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:09,683
[LALA]
I told you, I am death
incarnate...

181
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:13,119
Therefore, I am as
uncontrollable as death itself.

182
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,922
[SMITH]
Now why did you send Darling
that nasty letter?

183
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,324
[MIIA]
Don't tell me I have ANOTHER
rival to compete with!

184
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:21,528
[LALA]
It is impossible for the living
to escape death...

185
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,997
and, well...
being an executioner
aboveground,

186
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,567
I understand that
concept better than anyone else.

187
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:29,335
That being said... if a mortal
being was entitled to extra
territorial righ‐

188
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:33,540
[SMITH]
Just tell me what it is you came
here to do.

189
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,977
[LALA]
Mm... uh... Well, you see...

190
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,080
When I saw that man... I thought
it was so strange

191
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,650
how he was
always so close to death but
never died.

192
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,187
[MIIA]
Is that really your reason? I
don't get it.

193
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:50,490
[LALA]
What kind of harvester of souls
would I be if I were to overlook

194
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,794
something like that? His soul
was poised on the brink of
death;

195
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,896
I needed to ensure that
the job was done...

196
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:57,964
[SMITH]
Ensure the job was done? You're

197
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,301
lucky you didn't hurt Darling,
or there'd have been hell to
pay!

198
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,570
[KIMIHITO]
Why doesn't that make me feel
safe...?

199
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,073
[SMITH]
Every time we find a place for
you, you wind up missing.

200
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,611
[LALA]
Of course... Because no one
there is at death's door.

201
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,613
[SMITH]
You seriously think I'd let you

202
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:15,081
move in with someone who's about
to die?

203
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,350
[LALA]
It appears this agent from the

204
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,919
organization sees me as a
threat.

205
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,988
[KIMIHITO]
Oh, so the organization is Smith
and her crew.

206
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,757
[LALA]
Well then... I'm going to
stay right

207
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:25,726
here and observe this
human for a little longer.

208
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:29,630
[KIMIHITO] (huh?!)
[LALA] It shouldn't be a problem
if I move in with all of you.

209
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,897
[SMITH]
I'm fine with it!

210
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,666
[KIMIHITO]
Don't I get a say in this?!

211
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:35,201
[MIIA]
As long as she's not after
Darling.. sure.

212
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,204
[CEREA]
As long as she isn't really the
grim reaper after all.

213
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,907
[RACHNELA]
As long as I can tie her up
every once in a while.

214
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,176
[KIMIHITO]
Is that all it takes for you
guys?!

215
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,012
[SMITH]
I'm impressed, Darling. You were

216
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,314
able to see that it was all an
act.

217
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:51,918
Most people make up their minds
as soon as they take one look at
her.

218
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:56,189
[KIMIHITO]
Not me... I've gotten used to my
life being in danger.

219
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,959
Hm... You've got a point.

220
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,628
[KIMIHITO]
You know...She's just like
middle‐school me.

221
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:05,165
[LALA](Under)
I may not be the exact form of
death you perceived me to be...

222
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,000
[SMITH] Hold on...
[LALA] However, the Dullahans

223
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,003
Were you one of those weird kids
who pretended they had powers?

224
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:11,772
[LALA]
and that's much more terrifying!

225
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,840
[KIMIHITO] What? I have no idea
what you're talking about!

226
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,211
[LALA](Under)
But do not be afraid, mortals...
For death is only the beginning!

227
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:21,181
[KIMIHITO](14 y/o)
So, the final battle is
beginning.

228
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:25,986
Yes, it's me.It appears Ohama
would like to challenge our
power.

229
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:32,158
Oh, I already know... It's just
the kind of thing he'd do.

230
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,895
La... jodaso steana.

231
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,772
[KIMIHITO]
(sigh)

232
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,809
[KIMIHITO]
We're spending a fortune on
food.

233
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:51,912
These girls are eating me
out of house and home!

234
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,615
I was barely making ends meet
before...

235
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:57,784
... but with Lala here I don't
stand a chance.

236
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:03,123
It's gonna be tight this month.
I'll just have to make do with
what we've got.

237
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:07,493
Awesome...Hey Miia, any idea

238
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:08,929
what happened to all the
groceries?

239
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,831
[RACHNELA]
My goodness!‐ You were cooking

240
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,534
without tasting the food again,
weren't you, dear?...

241
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:15,602
Look what
you've done to poor Lala.

242
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:16,870
[MIIA]
I tasted it!

243
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,707
[KIMIHITO]
(sigh)Well... I think they're

244
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:23,043
having a sale at the
supermarket.

245
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:28,982
[KIMIHITO]
Of course. Today of all days.

246
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,284
[MIIA]
I wanted to go shopping with
Darling too!

247
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,386
[RACHNELA] Well somebody had to
finish the dishes,

248
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,221
and you did
make the mess! [MIIA](Under)
it's not fair!

249
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,725
[CEREA]
There's no helping it. We'll
have to go elsewhere.

250
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,528
(street/market chatter)

251
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:45,832
[MEAT SALESMAN]
Come on over! (ad‐libbed
meat‐selling under)

252
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,334
[MERO]
What a lively place this is!

253
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,937
[CEREA]
I've never been to an outdoor
market.

254
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:53,674
[KIMIHITO]
Eh, it's not all that exciting.
(hm??)

255
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,341
[FISH SALESMAN]
CLOSE UP THE SHOP, HURRY!

256
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,511
That
girl's a mermaid!‐ What if she
sees us selling fish?!

257
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:00,881
[MEAT SALESMAN]
There's a bird girl too! We have
to put away all this chicken!

258
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:02,616
[MEAT SALESMAN] Get rid of the
duck, honey!

259
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:04,317
[MEAT WIFE] Should
I do something about the horse
meat?!

260
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:08,054
MEAT SALESMAN/MEAT WIFE(Under)
(flailing, panicking)

261
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,323
[KIMIHITO]
It's okay, everybody! They eat

262
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:14,360
fish and poultry all the time!‐
Don't worry! It's fine

263
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,962
[MEAT SALESMAN]
(huh?!) Oh, well I had no idea.

264
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,799
[CEREA]
Well, I only eat vegetables...

265
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,603
[KIMIHITO]
(hm?)Mero?

266
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:24,270
FISH SALESMAN
Uhh hey...

267
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,407
[MERO]
My, the fish you sell here seem
to be very fresh.

268
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:31,612
They're so healthy. Not one of
them is too bony or dry.

269
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:36,182
Such exquisite fish... What a
rare and pleasant sight.

270
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,786
You may live on the land... but
you certainly have impeccable

271
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:42,589
judgement of aquatic creatures,
don't you?

272
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:46,860
As an ocean‐dweller, it touches
my heart that you possess such

273
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,063
an intricate understanding of my
world.

274
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,165
[MERO]
I just had to express my
gratitude.

275
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,334
FISH SALESMAN
THANK YOU SO MUCH, MISS

276
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:57,971
This is one of our top‐quality
yellowtail.

277
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,506
I'd really like you
to have it.

278
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:01,107
[MERO]
(happy)Awww

279
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,643
[KIMIHITO]
(freak out) We can't accept
something like that!

280
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:04,811
[KIDS]
(playing)(laughing)

281
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,947
[LITTLE GIRL A]
I wanna fly too, bird lady!

282
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:08,214
[LIL BOY E]
Let me go next!

283
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,216
[LITTLE GIRL A]
No way, wait your turn!

284
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:13,386
[KIMIHITO]
He ended up giving us a bunch of
extra stuff.

285
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,822
[MERO]
Yes, he was quite a generous
man.

286
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,391
[VEGGIE LADY]
I'm glad you like our
vegetables.

287
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:19,860
[KIMIHITO]
(hm?)(awkward)

288
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,394
[VEGGIE LADY]
Don't be shy, dear, have some
more!

289
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,930
[CEREA]
Oh no, I couldn't take any
more...

290
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,532
[VEGGIE LADY]
What are you talking about?

291
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:29,603
I'm sure a good strong girl like
you can eat plenty!

292
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,772
I highly recommend the carrots.

293
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,307
[CEREA]
Ca... carrots...

294
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,877
[CEREA]
(serious)

295
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:47,153
[CEREA]
(happy yell)

296
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,223
[CEREA]
These are incredible! So fresh
and sweet!

297
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:54,360
No... sweet doesn't
cover it! There's so much depth
to the flavor!

298
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,930
These carrots are the gods of
all vegetables!

299
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,967
Herbivores' taste buds are two
to four times more sensitive
than humans'.

300
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:07,373
That's why I can appreciate all
the complex flavor sensations in
these glorious carrots!

301
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,544
While we're on the subject,
carnivore species only have a

302
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:13,413
tiny fraction of the taste buds
humans have.

303
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:16,016
Might explains why Miia's such a
terrible cook.

304
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:17,884
[MIIA]
Actually, that's only one
reason.

305
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:21,087
[RACHNELA]
Who are you talking to?

306
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:24,357
[VEGGIE LADY]
Well! I'm happy to see you enjoy
them so much!

307
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:25,859
[CEREA]
(thrilled)

308
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,160
[VEGGIE LADY]
My sweet grandmother put her

309
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,095
heart and soul into growing
those carrots.

310
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,665
If you go ahead and stock up;
I'll give you a discount!

311
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,199
Plus a few extra!

312
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,335
[KIMIHITO]
That's nice of you, ma'am, but
we can't really

313
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,804
afford that
much... Money's kinda tight
so...

314
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:41,608
[VEGGIE LADY]
Oh, you're broke, are you? You
better feed this girl!

315
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,878
Here, you can take these with
you... Those are the
funny‐shaped

316
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:49,149
vegetables people
never want to buy... They still
taste delicious though!

317
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,017
[TOFU LADY]
Excuse me!

318
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,753
You can have this tofu pulp if
you like.

319
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:55,388
[EGG LADY]
That little bird friend of yours
has been a big help

320
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,858
playing with
the kids today, so I wanted to
thank her somehow.

321
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,994
These eggs are all grade B, but
you're welcome to take them.

322
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,863
BAKER MAN
Here, have some bread crusts!

323
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,866
[KIMIHITO]
Wow... You guys are so generous!

324
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,969
[PAPI
Look at all the food!

325
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,405
[KIMIHITO]
How are we gonna carry it?

326
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:14,841
[MERO]
Couldn't you take it on your
back, Lady Centorea?

327
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:16,610
[CEREA]
Do I look like a pack mule?!

328
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,179
[KIMIHITO]
Sorry to put you out, Cerea; do
you mind?

329
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,381
[CEREA]
My pleasure, Master!

330
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,017
[MERO]
That hardly seems right.

331
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:26,587
[CEREA]
I'm sorry...

332
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:27,754
[KIMIHITO]
Thanks again!

333
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:30,557
[SUU]
You're not going home yet,
Master?

334
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:34,227
[KIMIHITO]
Mmm... I think I'll get a little
more, just to be safe.

335
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,130
It takes a lot of groceries to
keep everybody fed...

336
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,366
[SUU]
Don't worry about me; I don't
need food.

337
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:44,638
I can always get my nutrients
from anything that's
digestible...

338
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:48,274
So you don't have to buy any
groceries for me, okay?

339
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:53,514
[KIMIHITO]
Thank you, Suu... but... I still

340
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:57,250
want everybody to eat the same
nice dinner at the same table.

341
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,286
I mean... we're family, right?

342
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:03,824
(surprised)Whoa, hey!

343
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:05,559
[SUU]
Come with me, Master!

344
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:10,263
[KIMIHITO]
W‐wait a second! GAH! MY AAAARM!

345
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,000
[KII]
I understand perfectly.

346
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,569
You've come into these woods to

347
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:19,005
collect some edible plants for
your dinner table, is that it?

348
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,406
[KIMIHITO]
Is that... okay?

349
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,375
[KII]
I'm the guardian of this
forest.

350
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:25,812
What makes you think I
would allow you to ravage it in
such a way?

351
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,313
[KIMIHITO]
Fair enough.

352
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:32,418
[KII]
(startled)Suu... what are
you‐?!‐ (gasp)

353
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:35,455
[SUU]
(start to suck)(extended
sucking)

354
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:40,861
[KII]
(extended moaning/gasping)

355
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:43,296
[KIMIHITO]
(panic) What the hell, Suu?!

356
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,265
[SUU]
She said no, so I thought I

357
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,534
should give her something in
return.

358
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:51,905
She seemed to like it when YOU
sucked on her like that last
time, Master.

359
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:54,941
[KII]
But I wasn't going to tell you
no.

360
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,242
[KIMIHITO]
Huh?

361
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:57,944
[KII]
Papi taught me that friends

362
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,513
should help each other.

363
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,917
[KII]
So, I will permit you to gather
a small amount.

364
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:06,119
Follow me; I'll take you there.

365
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,554
[KIMIHITO]
That's perfect... Thanks, Kii.

366
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:10,156
So that stump thing moves with
her?

367
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:14,094
Wow, check this place out!

368
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,096
[SUU]
Pretty!

369
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:17,931
[KII]
Feel free to pick some plants.‐

370
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:19,666
Those ones over there should be
edible.

371
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:24,705
[KIMIHITO]
Um... some of these are
definitely poisonous mushrooms.

372
00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:27,440
[KII]
All I did was direct you to an
area with plants that

373
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,744
are ripe
and firm enough to be
ingested...

374
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:33,479
[KII]
Whether or not those plants are
poisonous...

375
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,180
I have no idea.

376
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,516
[KIMIHITO]
(stunned)

377
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:37,417
[KIMIHITO]
I don't know enough about plants

378
00:18:37,518 --> 00:18:39,485
to figure out which ones are
safe to eat.

379
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:42,322
Sorry, Suu, but I
think we should call it a day.

380
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:43,857
[SUU]
Ding ding!(eating)

381
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:44,791
[KIMIHITO]
(huh?)

382
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:45,959
[SUU]
Bzzz!

383
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:47,227
[KIMIHITO]
No way!...

384
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,262
You can tell if
they're poisonous?!

385
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,965
[SUU]
This kind here is okay to eat.

386
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:54,701
But this one's not.

387
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,603
[KII]
(impressed(I didn't know you
could do that.

388
00:18:56,703 --> 00:19:00,406
[KIMIHITO]
I hope she doesn't get sick from
eating that stuff...

389
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,618
[KIMIHITO]
(sigh)

390
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:13,353
[KIMIHITO]
We ended up taking a lot more

391
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,556
than I thought we would...
Sorry, Kii.

392
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:21,261
[KII]
That's alright... The forest has
plenty more to give.

393
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:24,264
Tell Papi to come visit me when
she has a chance.

394
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,600
[KIMIHITO]
Yeah, we'll come back.

395
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,801
[KII]
Not you.

396
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:29,503
[KIMIHITO]
(awkward)

397
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:32,939
[KIMIHITO]
Suu... you sure you're okay?

398
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,543
[SUU]
Yep, I'm perfectly fine!‐ But we
should hurry home, Master;

399
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:38,945
those
freeloaders are probably hungry
by now.

400
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:42,816
[KIMIHITO]
That was kinda harsh. Is that
the poison talking?

401
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,751
[DRACO]
THERE YOU ARE!

402
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:45,852
[KIMIHITO]
(uhh)

403
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,353
[DRACO]
Miia WILL be my bride!

404
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:49,790
Now hand
her over, you filthy human!

405
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:53,694
[SUU]
(spit)

406
00:19:56,897 --> 00:20:01,367
[DRACO]
I‐I can't move! What'd you do to
me?!

407
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,036
[KIMIHITO]
So she IS poison.

408
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:04,370
[DRACO]
(gasp)

409
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:06,940
[DRACO]
N‐no, wait! I'll leave him
alone,

410
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,309
I swear! Just let me go
and I won't lay a claw on him!

411
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:13,313
[DRACO]
(scream)

412
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:16,382
[DRACO]
(panting)

413
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,089
[KIMIHITO]
Sorry for the wait!

414
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:26,593
Ladies...Bon appetit!

415
00:20:27,928 --> 00:20:30,430

L A] (amazed)

416
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:34,400
MIIA/CEREA/PAPI/MERO/LALA/RACHNE
L A] Thanks for the food!

417
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,538
[KIMIHITO]
(sigh)And we've got lots to
spare too!...

418
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:39,740
We should be good
for a while.

419
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:44,477
And it's all thanks to you,
Suu.Great job.

420
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:47,080
[SUU](Under)
(happy sounds)

421
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,348
[KIMIHITO]
(annoyed)

422
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:50,183
[SMITH]
Well, good evening, Darling!...

423
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:52,118
We were in the neighborhood, so
we thought

424
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:53,554
we might join you all
for dinner.

425
00:20:53,654 --> 00:20:55,221
[ZOMBINA]
Ooh!.. Smells good!

426
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:57,123
[TIO]
Yeah, I'm really hungry!

427
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,692
[MANAKO]
Sorry to interrupt.

428
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:02,328
[DOPPEL]
I tried to tell them not to, but
here we are.

429
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:05,799
[SMITH]
That looks good!

430
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:07,668
[TIO]
I don't think this'll be enough
food...

431
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,503
[SMITH]
You're right.
Whip up a few more

432
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,505
helpings,
would you, Darling?

433
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:15,475
[KIMIHITO]
(weak laugh)

434
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:18,712
Okay! Keep those orders coming,
everybody!

435
00:21:18,812 --> 00:21:21,682
I'll make you as much food as
you can eat!

436
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,584
[SMITH] More tempura, please!
[KIMIHITO] Here!

437
00:21:23,684 --> 00:21:26,386
[CEREA]
Would you mind making us another
salad?

438
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:27,654
[KIMIHITO]
More salad, coming up!

439
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:29,422
[TIO]
I want more bread pudding!

440
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:31,257
[KIMIHITO]
I'll get that right away!

441
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:33,594
[MIIA]
Aww, I didn't get to try any
yet!

442
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:38,464
[KIMIHITO]
(power up)YOUR WISH IS MY
COMMAND!

443
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:40,534
[MIIA]
That was delicious!

444
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:41,935
[CEREA/MANAKO]
Thank you for dinner.

445
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:43,103
[PAPI
(burp)

446
00:21:43,203 --> 00:21:45,205
ZOMBINA
I'm so full I could die...

447
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:47,908
DOPPEL
It's a little late for that.

448
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:49,142
[SMITH]
What is it, Darling?

449
00:21:49,242 --> 00:21:50,276
[KIMIHITO]
What?!‐ What are you talking

450
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:51,745
about?‐ Everything's peachy!

451
00:21:51,845 --> 00:21:53,880
[SUU]
Actually, Master's devastated
because those

452
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,382
freeloaders just
went through all the groceries
in one meal

453
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:57,951
and now we have no
[more] food left.

454
00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:00,186
[KIMIHITO]
A‐AH, SUU, I SEE YOU'RE STILL
FULL OF POISON.

455
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:02,088
[SMITH]
Darling...

456
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:04,658
[KIMIHITO]
Uh, don't listen to Suu; she's
not herself today!

457
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:08,361
[SMITH]
You do know you can expense
groceries, right?

458
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:11,698
[KIMIHITO]
(stunned)

459
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,534
[SMITH]
Didn't I tell you that?...

460
00:22:13,634 --> 00:22:14,801
All
you have to do is keep your

461
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:17,303
receipts and we'll reimburse you
in full.

462
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:18,872
[KIMIHITO]
(rage‐drowning)

463
00:22:18,972 --> 00:22:21,642
[SMITH]
Now what are you doing, Darling?

464
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:26,006
[KIMIHITO]
Sometimes it's difficult, and
things can get pretty crazy...

465
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:29,042
But I gotta admit, it's always
an adventure.

466
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:30,911
And that...

467
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:35,115
is Everyday Life
with Monster Girls.

468
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:36,617
[KIMIHITO]
