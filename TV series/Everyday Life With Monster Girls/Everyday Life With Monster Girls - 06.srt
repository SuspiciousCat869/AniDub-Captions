1
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:08,241
[MIIA]
If you're not sure how to
season your cooking...
"S" is the magic letter!

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,910
[MIIA]
Sugar! Salt!

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,745
[MIIA]
Vinegar! Soy sauce!

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,079
[MIIA]
Woo!

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,749
Vinegar starts with V,
but yeah, sure.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,085
[MIIA]
And of course, we can't
forget the secret
ingredient...

7
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:23,524
It's my burning hot..
love.. for.. you!

8
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:24,525
[MIIA]
(giggle)

9
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:25,258
Uh‐oh...

10
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,893
Nope, that's fire!

11
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:29,062
(panic) Are you sure
I can't help you, Miia?!

12
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:34,167
It's okay! I have to beat
out the competition to
become your bride, right?

13
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,503
And right now,
I am on FIRE!

14
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,405
[KIMIHITO]
If you're not careful,
we'll all be on fire.

15
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:43,544
Starting today, I'm gonna
cook all of our meals.

16
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:47,047
They say the best way to
a man's heart is through his
stomach!

17
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,583
I can see it now...

18
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,586
[KIMIHITO]
I'm home from work, Miia.

19
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:55,088
[MIIA]
Welcome back, Darling!
[KIMIHITO] (hm?)

20
00:00:55,188 --> 00:01:01,261
[MIIA]
Would you like dinner...
or a hot bath? Or maybe...
you.. want.. me!

21
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:04,330
[KIMIHITO]
I'll have YOU for dinner
in the bath!

22
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,133
Ooooh, you're so greedy,
Darling!

23
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,502
Ah, I can't wait...

24
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,270
This has very little
to do with cooking...

25
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,540
[MIIA]
(spacing out)

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,110
[KIMIHITO]
Where is everybody?
I guess they're still
asleep. (surprised)

27
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,679
[KIMIHITO]
The pot's boiling over!

28
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,681
[MIIA]
(huh?) (panic)

29
00:01:23,449 --> 00:01:24,751
[MIIA]
(breath) (pained cry)

30
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:28,822
[KIMIHITO]
(startled) Miia!

31
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:06,820
[KIMIHITO]
Miia... Everyone makes
mistakes sometimes...
If you just keep trying‐

32
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,323
[MIIA]
I‐it's fine! I'm not upset
about the cooking anymore!

33
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:16,329
So, um... if you don't
mind, could you leave me
alone for a little while?

34
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,233
[KIMIHITO]
(notice) (huh?)

35
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,235
[MIIA]
Why is this happening

36
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,236
This is bad...

37
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:26,372
Oh no... What should I do?

38
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,509
I can't do it
without hands.

39
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:31,177
[KIMIHITO]
Is this some kind of paper?

40
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,113
[MIIA]
(surprised) Don't!

41
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,480
[MIIA]
Ow...

42
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,017
[KIMIHITO]
(groan) (notice)

43
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,885
[MIIA]
(look up)

44
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,387
[KIMIHITO]
You're molting?

45
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:45,225
[MIIA]
(sob) (cry)

46
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:49,530
[KIMIHITO]
Well... I didn't know lamias
molted just like snakes.

47
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,065
[KIMIHITO]
So is that why you were
spacing out?

48
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:56,002
I was hoping you would never
have to see me while I'm
shedding my skin, Darling...

49
00:03:56,102 --> 00:04:00,406
But now that I've burned my
hands, I'm gonna need some
help with the stripping.

50
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:01,675
[KIMIHITO]
(shocked)

51
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,009
The skin, I mean.

52
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:04,377
[KIMIHITO]
Oh.. yeah, that!

53
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:05,812
[MIIA]
Uh‐huh...

54
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,348
(clear throat) Nothing.

55
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,183
You shouldn't stress
out over it...

56
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,686
I mean... I can always
see your tail, so‐

57
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,087
[MIIA]
You don't understand‐

58
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,522
For lamias, being seen
molting

59
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,758
is way worse than
being seen naked!

60
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:22,629
This stinks...
I can't cook, I can't clean
or do laundry...

61
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,766
And if that wasn't bad
enough...

62
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,268
I can't even
shed my skin right.

63
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,136
[MIIA]
I can't marry you...

64
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:31,437
not if I can't live up to

65
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,406
your expectations
as your bride!

66
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:36,777
After you finally said
you'd consider marriage!

67
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,479
I've never messed up
molting before!

68
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,114
What's wrong with me?!
(crying)

69
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:44,851
[KIMIHITO]
That's called an
unsuccessful molting, right?

70
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,887
[KIMIHITO]
It happens to snakes
when they're stressed out.

71
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,321
[MIIA]
(huh?)

72
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,490
It could be that you're
feeling a little tense

73
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:53,560
because you're adapting to
a new living environment.

74
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,129
But you might get a skin
disease if you leave it
like that.

75
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:00,300
[MIIA]
(huh?)
How do you know so much
about this, Darling?

76
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,868
[KIMIHITO]
Oh, I've been doing some
studying...

77
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,738
Smith actually gave me some
helpful advice too.

78
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,574
[SMITH]
Lamias are biologically
similar to snakes...

79
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,076
Here you go,
educate yourself.

80
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:11,411
[MIIA]
(surprised)

81
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:13,079
If I'm gonna live with
all of you...

82
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:13,947
I should know these things.

83
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,415
[MIIA]
Darling!

84
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:18,184
Don't worry, I'll be happy
to help with your molting.

85
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:22,455
But in exchange... I want you
to help me when I molt.

86
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:25,491
[MIIA]
(huh?) But I thought
humans didn't molt.

87
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,661
[KIMIHITO] We do.
[MIIA] (surprised)

88
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,897
[KIMIHITO]
But it only happens
when we get sunburned.

89
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,003
[KIMIHITO]
Well... Here goes nothing!

90
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,171
[MIIA]
(reluctant nod)

91
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,673
Let me know if I'm
hurting you.

92
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,174
[MIIA]
(gasp)
(extended flustered panting)

93
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,643
[KIMIHITO]
Wow...

94
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:44,878
It comes right off,
doesn't it?

95
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,948
I guess this means all that
studying paid off
after all.

96
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,216
[KIMIHITO]
Um...

97
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,552
[MIIA]
(panting) (wince)

98
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:57,390
(pant) (muffled flusterment)

99
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,359
[KIMIHITO]
(gulp)

100
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:03,564
[MIIA]
Aaah! (overwhelmed)

101
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,065
[MIIA]
(gasp) (overwhelmed)

102
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:08,434
(extended panting)

103
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,672
[KIMIHITO]
(panting)

104
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:16,877
[KIMIHITO]
Just do it...
Don't think about it!

105
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:17,778
[MIIA]
(gasp)

106
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:18,679
(startled)

107
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,714
[MIIA]
D‐Darling...

108
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:24,551
The t‐tip of my tail
is, um...

109
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,086
[KIMIHITO]
I‐it's sensitive, right?

110
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:28,955
You'll just have to be patient
for a sec, okay, Miia?

111
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:33,459
[MIIA]
(startled)
(squeal, into panting)

112
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,429
[KIMIHITO]
(surprised) (choking)

113
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,231
[MIIA]
Please, Darling,
we have to stop!

114
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,366
I just can't take it
anymore!

115
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:43,637
[MIIA]
If you don't stop
touching me there,
I'm gonna go crazy!

116
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,807
[KIMIHITO]
Come on, hang in there
a little longer!

117
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,308
It's just the tip, okay?
Just the tip!

118
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,010
[MIIA]
(scream) (extended panting)

119
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,013
[KIMIHITO]
Okay... I got it!
(panting)

120
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,051
[KIMIHITO]
That.. wasn't so bad...

121
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,621
Why don't we take the rest
off your stomach now, huh?

122
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:02,556
Flip on over to your back.

123
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,859
[MIIA]
Okay...

124
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,694
[KIMIHITO]
We're done with the tip of
your tail,

125
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:11,064
so you should be able to
rela‐ huh? (panic)

126
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:16,970
[MIIA]
Um, Darling?
Don't look at me, okay?
I'm taking it off now...

127
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,907
[KIMIHITO]
W‐wait a minute, Miia!
Don't you think it's better if
you do that part yourself?!

128
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,877
[MIIA]
But, this is the most
sensitive area...

129
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:28,549
If I leave any of the old skin
on it... I‐I'll get all
itchy...

130
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:32,018
So... please, Darling...
could you...?

131
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,722
[KIMIHITO]
(gulp) Y‐yeah...

132
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,559
Okay, now where's the rest
of the skin? (react)

133
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:41,595
[MIIA]
Um, n‐not there.
A little to the right.

134
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:44,665
[KIMIHITO]
Right, the right!
Uh, wait, it that your
right or my right?

135
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:50,103
[MIIA]
Oh, I'm sorry...
I meant more to my right.
(gasp)

136
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:54,841
[KIMIHITO] (horny)
Being blinded is making me
focus on my hands even more...

137
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,710
I can feel how warm she is.

138
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,946
[MIIA] (extended gasping)
[KIMIHITO] Wow, she's soft...

139
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,348
[KIMIHITO]
Ah, and smooth and silky
and squishy...

140
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,818
[MII]
(flustered) (gasp)

141
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,089
[KIMIHITO]
This is a lot different
from the scaly parts.

142
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,724
[MIIA]
(pant) (gasp)

143
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,827
Darling... I'm really sensitive
right there... (flustered)

144
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:17,430
[KIMIHITO]
I can't wait to touch her
delicate skin...

145
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:20,901
[MIIA]
(scream, into panting)

146
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:25,672
[MIIA]
I‐I'm sorry, Darling...
I'm alright now...

147
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:28,542
I can take it... There's only a
little bit left!

148
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,110
[MIIA]
(panting)

149
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,879
[KIMIHITO]
I got a little carried away.

150
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:39,285
Aw man, if this keeps up...
then I'm probably gonna start
coming outta my own skin too!

151
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:45,058
I gotta finish this quick!
M‐Miia, tell me where the
rest of the skin is!

152
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,694
[MIIA]
T‐to the right...
(panting under)

153
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,230
[KIMIHITO]
Okay, I got it!
A little to my right!

154
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,599
It'll be fine as long
as your hand is there!

155
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,034
[MIIA]
(huh?)

156
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,837
[KIMIHITO]
Alright, Miia, here I goooo!

157
00:08:56,937 --> 00:09:00,641
[MIIA]
(gasp) D‐Darling,
I didn't mean YOUR right!

158
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,678
[GOOFY SNAKE A]
Comin' in!

159
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:19,926
[KIMIHITO]
Something feels we‐
(scream) (pass out)

160
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:25,999
[MIIA]
(gasp) No! Darliiiiiing!

161
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,769
[SHRIEK A]
(horror scream)

162
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:31,738
[MIIA]
Here you go, Darling!
Hope you enjoy!

163
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,073
[KIMIHITO]
(disgusted)

164
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,709
Bon apetit! This is to say
thank you.

165
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,978
[KIMIHITO]
(huh?)

166
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,713
[KIMIHITO]
The hell is that stuff?

167
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:43,383
Is it some kind of traditional
lamia cuisine? Eugh...

168
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:44,518
[MIIA]
(giggle)

169
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,720
[KIMIHITO]
(nauseous)

170
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,356
[KIMIHITO]
(more nauseous)

171
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:51,625
[MIIA]
(giggle)

172
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,260
[KIMIHITO]
Looks delicious...

173
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,162
(forced eating)

174
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,000
(crash to table)

175
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,003
[KIMIHITO]
Wow, couldn't eat another bite,
thank you Miia...

176
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,539
[MIIA]
(happy) I can't believe
you ate all of it!

177
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,008
[KIMIHITO]
I've never tasted anything
like that,

178
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,777
and I might not live to taste
anything else again.

179
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,378
[KIMIHITO]
(notices door)

180
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,748
[PAPI/MERO] (nauseous)
[CEREA] No... we're too late.

181
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:18,218
[KIMIHITO]
What happened to you guys?
I haven't seen you since
breakfast!

182
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:21,487
[CEREA]
Ugh.. What is that smell?

183
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:22,989
[MIIA]
Oh! Let's see...

184
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,226
Curry, meat and potatoes,
hamburger steak,

185
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:30,163
fried rice, pork soup...
Ooh, and pudding!

186
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:33,199
[KIMIHITO]
Uh, Miia?
Did you follow a recipe?

187
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,002
[MIIA]
(mm‐mm!) I learned by watching
you!

188
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,138
[CEREA/PAPI/SUU/MERO]
(long nauseous)

189
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:41,141
[MIIA]
But I had everybody taste it,
so it should be okay!

190
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,443
[KIMIHITO]
Uh, why didn't you taste it
yourself?

191
00:10:43,544 --> 00:10:47,080
[MIIA]
'Cause I always lose my
appetite when I start molting!

192
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,651
[KIMIHITO]
(long nauseous)

193
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:57,157
[MIIA]
MonMusu!

194
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,733
[MIIA/CEREA/SUU/PAPI]
MonMusu!

195
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:08,935
[KIMIHITO]
I'm home.

196
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,336
[MIIA]
Welcome back!

197
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,638
Good to see you, Darling.

198
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,239
[PAPI]
Hey, Master?

199
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,208
[MERO]
Did you stop by the supermarket
today?

200
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,177
[KIMIHITO]
Yeah, they were having
a big sale there...

201
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,279
Vegetables and eggs
were dirt cheap.

202
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,514
[PAPI]
Uh, Master?

203
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:21,982
[MIIA/MERO]
(annoyed)

204
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:23,183
[SUU]
Master! Master, Master!

205
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,585
[PAPI]
I need to tell y‐

206
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:25,852
[CEREA]
Stop that, Suu!

207
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,220
Give Master some space;
he's exhausted!

208
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,055
[PAPI]
Master, I have something
to tell you!

209
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,424
Okay, I'm listening, Papi;
what's the matter?

210
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,127
[PAPI]
So you know,
I'm gonna lay an egg soon.

211
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,729
[CEREA/MIIA/MERO]
(shock)

212
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,064
[SUU]
(hm?)

213
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:43,169
[MIIA]
Oh wait, it's unfertilized.
That doesn't necessarily mean
you guys did it! My bad!

214
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,871
[MERO]
You frightened me for a moment!

215
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,841
[CEREA]
Oh Papi... You little
troublemaker!

216
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,010
[SUU]
(dazed) (play‐swinging)

217
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,945
How's it work?
Do you lay eggs every day
like a chicken or what?

218
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,749
[PAPI]
I'm not a chicken! I haven't
laid an egg in a long time!

219
00:11:55,849 --> 00:12:00,554
But this WILL be the first time
I've done it since I came to
Japan, so I'm a little nervous.

220
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:02,222
[SUU]
(playing)

221
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:03,990
[MIIA]
Aw.. maybe it's because
you're stressed out?

222
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,426
Well... I think we'd better
talk to Ms. Smith about it.

223
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,894
[ALL]
(surprised at doorbell)

224
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,129
[KIMIHITO]
Um, can I help you, sir?

225
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,931
[KASEGI]
I believe you can!

226
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:12,866
Is there a young harpy
living in this household

227
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,068
who's getting ready to
lay an egg, by any chance?

228
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,537
[KIMIHITO]
Huh?

229
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:18,104
Wait how would you know that?

230
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:21,007
[KASEGI]
I was tapping your...
I mean, just a hunch!

231
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,709
Filmmakers know these things.

232
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,210
[KIMIHITO]
Filmmaker?

233
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,780
Ah, how rude of me! My
name's Kasegi;

234
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,682
I'm an experimental
film director.

235
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:34,020
My current project is
a documentary about the
Interspecies Exchange.

236
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,289
I was hoping you'd be
available for an interview.

237
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:39,560
[KASEGI]
(excited laughter)
Look at this wide hallway!

238
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,361
[KASEGI] (growing amusement)
[KIMIHITO] I'm kinda concerned.

239
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:44,464
So am I, but we DID come here
for an interspecies exchange.

240
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:47,500
[CEREA]
We should do what we can
to promote understanding.

241
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,069
[MIIA]
Does my hair look okay?

242
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,505
Don't worry... It's not any
different than usual.

243
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:54,808
[KASEGI]
Alright, why don't we start
with our little expectant harpy
friend?

244
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,176
[SUU]
(playing)

245
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,311
Beautiful... Is it time yet?

246
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,246
[PAPI]
(shaking head)

247
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,348
Then I'll get some footage of
the other girls' rooms

248
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,084
while we're waiting
for the main event!

249
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:05,586
[MERO/CEREA/MIIA/KIMIHITO]
(confused)

250
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:07,788
It's for the good of society!

251
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,455
You don't mind, right?

252
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:12,292
When you put it that way, I
suppose we don't have a choice.

253
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,895
[KASEGI]
(grin)

254
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,697
[MERO]
These are my living quarters,
Sir Kasegi.

255
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:19,265
[KASEGI]
Ah, that's why you're in a
swimsuit!

256
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,168
So you like gothic Lolita
fashion?

257
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,537
[MERO]
Yes, I do.

258
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:24,738
[KASEGI]
By the way...

259
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,139
Are you wearing underwear?

260
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,708
[MERO]
(shocked)

261
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,042
[KASEGI]
I'm curious to see what's

262
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,110
under that cute skirt...

263
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,377
[MIIA]
What's wrong with you?!

264
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,279
You can't just ask a girl that!
(fuming)

265
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:37,417
It's all for educational
purposes, I swear! Nothing
sketchy here.

266
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:39,352
Can you show me how
you get out of the pool?

267
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:42,989
[MERO]
Certainly, but it's very
simple.

268
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:45,626
I just build up momentum
and leap!

269
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:47,928
[KASEGI]
(grunt)

270
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,162
[MERO]
Did you get a good shot?

271
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,931
[KASEGI]
Oh, yeah.

272
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,165
[MERO]
(gasp, into shriek)

273
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,134
[KASEGI]
(snickering)

274
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,836
[KIMIHITO]
Hey that's not cool!

275
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:57,838
Don't worry about that,
we'll cut it in post.

276
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:01,274
Now let's keep the ball rolling
and see what we can
discover in Centorea's room!

277
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,909
[CEREA] (surprised)
[KIMIHITO] Listen, buddy...

278
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,778
Look. There is no reason
to fear, Master...

279
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:07,614
Now that I've seen what
happened to Mero,
I'll be on my guard.

280
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:13,019
A noble Centaur like me
is courageous through any
adversity!

281
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,421
[KASEGI]
Ooh, a Japanese‐style room!
Classy!

282
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:20,561
[CEREA]
Yes, I prefer tatami mats.
The nice texture...
and the grassy smell...

283
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:24,230
You see, my people don't
traditionally sleep on beds or
futons...

284
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,166
Tatami mats are better for
beings of my size‐

285
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,634
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

286
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,202
Anyway, are you wearing
underwear?

287
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:31,437
[CEREA]
What?! Where did that question
come from?!

288
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,273
That's got nothing to do with
this!

289
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,408
[KASEGI]
You don't wear bras either?

290
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:38,344
Um‐if you must know,
it's not customary for
Centaurs to wear underwear!

291
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,446
[KASEGI] I'll have to
investigate further!
[CEREA] (gasp)

292
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,216
[KASEGI]
Damn, these are massive!
Do they hurt your back?

293
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:44,618
[CEREA]
(uncomfortable) (angry)

294
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,219
You've taken this indecency
too far!

295
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,154
I won't tolerate
any more of this!

296
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,990
[KASEGI]
Who cares if it bugs you?

297
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,625
[CEREA]
(huh?!) (pushed back)

298
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,727
[KASEGI]
Asking the hard‐hitting
questions is what I do!

299
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:56,830
Even if you and all the other
monsters in the world hate my
guts for it..

300
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,232
this is my one true calling!
[CEREA] (pushed) (startled)

301
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:02,736
[KASEGI]
I can promise you... I will
fight for unity of all species!

302
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:04,237
[CEREA]
(fuming)

303
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,640
[KASEGI]
Now let's go check out Miia's
bedroom!

304
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,742
[MIIA]
(surprised) (sigh)

305
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,944
Well, here's my room, happy
now?

306
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,713
[KASEGI]
So, are you wearing underwear?

307
00:15:12,813 --> 00:15:15,448
[MIIA]
That's all you wanna know?!
Yes, I am, okay?!

308
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:17,684
[KASEGI]
Would you mind
showing us, please?

309
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,953
[MIIA]
(annoyed)
I don't think so!

310
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:22,288
[KASEGI]
(gasp)
What's this?!

311
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,457
[MIIA]
(shriek) (clutch)

312
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:25,659
[KASEGI]
Hmmm!

313
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,027
[KIMIHITO]
Is that your molted skin?

314
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:27,961
Why didn't you trash it?

315
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,062
[KASEGI]
Skin?!

316
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:30,531
I was afraid if I threw it out,

317
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:31,765
the birds would get into it!

318
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,333
That would be way too
embarrassing!

319
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,401
[KASEGI]
No, you can't throw that away!

320
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:39,806
A rare item like that
would drive people crazy!

321
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:43,309
The Japanese have always
considered snake skins
to be lucky charms!

322
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,746
We've even built holy shrines
for worshipping
snakes as gods!

323
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:49,650
And snake skins have been
used in traditional Chinese
medicine for years!

324
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,785
But if you're just going
to throw out such a
valuable artifact,

325
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:54,254
I'd be more than happy
to take it off your hands!

326
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:56,389
[MIIA]
Ew, forget it,
I'm not giving you that!

327
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:59,693
Only a sicko would want to
keep somebody else's skin!

328
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,695
[KIMIHITO]
She does have a point...

329
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,597
[KASEGI]
Alright, then instead of snake
lovers,

330
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:05,532
I can give it to a
research lab...

331
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,934
Maybe they can make some
scientific discoveries with it.

332
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:09,269
[MIIA]
You mean it?

333
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:10,937
[KASEGI]
It might help us understand

334
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,105
each other on a deeper level!

335
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:13,740
[MIIA]
Uh, deeper? (hm?)

336
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,942
Might even lead to you getting

337
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,244
hitched to Darli‐er, that guy.

338
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,547
[MIIA]
Wait a minute...

339
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:25,819
[MIIA]
Well, I guess if it's to better
society,

340
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,022
I would be a bad person
if I said no, now wouldn't I?
(conniving laughter)

341
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,223
[KASEGI] (tch)
[KIMIHITO] (hm?)

342
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,858
[KASEGI]
This could be better...

343
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,895
I'd be rolling in cash if I had
a video of the molting...

344
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,196
[KIMIHITO]
(huh?) (startled)

345
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:37,831
[MERO]
Master, help, it's Papi!

346
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:38,932
[KIMIHITO]
(surprised)

347
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:40,366
[KIMIHITO]
Papi!

348
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:44,771
[PAPI]
Um... I think... it's...
coming...

349
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,607
[KIMIHITO]
Uh, try to relax, okay?!

350
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:50,977
[MIIA]
Yeah, try Lamaze breathing!
Hee, hee hee, hoo!

351
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:54,748
Breathe in two times
and then hoo, let all the air
out at once okay!

352
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:58,218
[MERO]
You know a great deal
about childbirth...

353
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,053
[KIMIHITO]
Do you really have to
record the whole thing?!

354
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:02,789
[KASEGI]
This is for cultural
awareness, remember?!

355
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:06,927
Now then, Miss Papi, go ahead
and pull up that skirt for me!

356
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:07,961
[KIMIHITO]
Dude!

357
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:08,829
[PAPI]
(pull)

358
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:09,996
[KASEGI]
Whoo!

359
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,364
Aren't you taking this too far?

360
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:12,966
[KASEGI]
So give her a hand..

361
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,367
After all, the sooner
she lays the egg,

362
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,236
the sooner I'll be
out of your hair, right?

363
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:17,638
[KIMIHITO]
(stunned)

364
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:21,441
[PAPI]
(extended panting)

365
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,243
[KASEGI]
Nice moves there, "Master".

366
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:25,512
[KIMIHITO]
Shut up!

367
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,848
Oh, by the way, what do you
plan on doing with the egg
after it comes out?

368
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:29,415
I'm just curious.

369
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:31,051
[KIMIHITO]
Would you just be quiet
for five seconds?!

370
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:32,519
[KASEGI]
(chuckle)

371
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:37,457
[PAPI]
M‐Master...
just a little...

372
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,560
[KIMIHITO]
Sorry, was I being too rough?

373
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,295
[PAPI]
(panting) No, just go a little
lower... (flustered)

374
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,897
[KIMIHITO]
Lower?!

375
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:46,099
[PAPI]
(mmmfff!) (panting)

376
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:50,704
[KIMIHITO]
(ggh!)
I feel something hard...
Is that the egg, or...?

377
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:53,507
[PAPI]
(squeal) Ah... Master...

378
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:59,212
I can... feel... the egg...
It's gonna.. come out!

379
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:00,914
[KIMIHITO]
Y‐you can do it, Papi!

380
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:03,116
Okay! That looks excellent,
now take her panties off!

381
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,985
[KIMIHITO]
(shocked)

382
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,287
[KASEGI]
You want to make the world
a better place, don't you?!

383
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,955
[KIMIHITO]
Oh, come on, man!

384
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,291
[PAPI]
It's okay... Master...
(panting)

385
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:14,260
[KIMIHITO]
But... (nervous)

386
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:19,800
[KASEGI]
That's it! Time for the
uncensored egg‐laying scene.

387
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,804
[KASEGI]
Harpy eggs are so rare, I can
easily get 3 million for one.

388
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:26,306
[KASEGI]
And if I packaged the
footage along with it...

389
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:28,775
it'd be worth 4, no, 5 million!

390
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,244
[KASEGI]
These freaks of nature
bring in a pretty penny!

391
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:35,315
[KASEGI/SUU]
It's a good thing they're so
stupid; they fall for almost
anything!

392
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:36,883
[KIMIHITO/MIIA/CEREA/MERO]
(surprised)

393
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:42,756
[KASEGI] (startled)
[SUU]
Now we're getting to the
sexiest part.

394
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:45,626
Man, I can't wait to whack off
to this thing before I sell it!

395
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:47,027
[KASEGI]
(scream)

396
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,663
[MIIA]
So that's what this was all
about, huh?

397
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:52,533
[CEREA]
Unity? World peace? Ridiculous!

398
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,035
[MERO]
You insolent mongrel!
How despicable!

399
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,539
[MIIA]
You were just trying to make a
quick buck off us! How dare
you?!

400
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,306
[CEREA]
Give us back Miia's skin, now!

401
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:03,076
[MERO]
Yes, and surrender the camera!

402
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:04,745
[KASEGI]
I'm not afraid of you!

403
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:07,614
Monsters like you aren't
allowed to hurt humans,
remember?

404
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:09,783
This camera is my property
and mine alone!

405
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:13,253
I won't let you lay hands,
hooves, or fins on it,
do you hear me?!

406
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,955
[KIMIHITO]
Hey, hotshot.

407
00:19:15,055 --> 00:19:17,490
[KIMIHITO]
You wanted Papi's egg too,
didn't you?

408
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:23,396
[KASEGI]
Ah! The egg! My precious 3
million yen! (happy)

409
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,666
[KASEGI]
(punched)

410
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:31,137
[KIMIHITO]
Get your eggs from the
supermarket; they're having a
sale.

411
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,305
[KASEGI]
(weak)

412
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,908
[PAPI]
(touched)

413
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,309
[ALL]
You're so brave, Master.

414
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:39,412
Oh, wait, did you
seriously smash Papi's egg?!

415
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:40,213
[CEREA/MERO/SUU]
(concerned)

416
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:41,214
Course not!

417
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:42,415
That was just a regular egg

418
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:44,050
I picked up when I
went shopping today.

419
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,452
[CEREA/SUU]
Clever!

420
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:48,121
[KIMIHITO]
You did good too, Suu.

421
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:50,123
Yeah, I had no idea
you could do that!

422
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:53,694
[CEREA]
A slime who can read minds?
Quite impressive.

423
00:19:53,794 --> 00:19:54,661
[SUU]
(happy)

424
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,262
[MERO]
Pardon me, everyone!

425
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,131
I believe the real egg
is on its way now!

426
00:19:58,231 --> 00:19:59,900
[PAPI]
(panting) (small push)

427
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,334
[CEREA]
You can do this, Papi!

428
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,869
[MERO]
Just a little further!

429
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:05,205
Your breathing!
Don't forget your breathing!

430
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:07,007
Hee, hee, hoo! Hee, hee, hoo!

431
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:08,709
[KIMIHITO]
(grabbed) Miia! Come on!

432
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:13,113
[MIIA]
I'm not letting you see this!
Whoa, it's coming out!

433
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,380
[CEREA]
Goodness, it's quite large.

434
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,150
[MERO]
Wow, it's really stretched...

435
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,886
[KIMIHITO]
Stop making such graphic
commentary!

436
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:22,255
[PAPI]
(scream)

437
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,825
[KIMIHITO/MIIA/CEREA/MERO/SUU]
(amazed)

438
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:30,163
So... what are we going to do
with Papi's egg?

439
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:34,535
[MERO] Yes, I wasn't aware such
a thing was so valuable... How
perplexing.

440
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:37,237
[KIMIHITO]
Hmm... Well, what do you
think, Ms. Smith?

441
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:41,374
[SMITH]
Don't ask me! You know I don't
get paid enough to get involved
in this!

442
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,309
[SMITH]
Oh, by the way, Darling...

443
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,345
[KIMIHITO]
Yeah?

444
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,013
[SMITH]
About that director.

445
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,550
The name and address on his
card were both fake.

446
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,053
But his M. O. was sophisticated,
so he might be a repeat
offender.

447
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:54,254
I'll look into it.

448
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:55,255
[KIMIHITO]
Uh‐huh...

449
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:56,456
Well anyway...

450
00:20:56,557 --> 00:20:58,725
what are we having
for dinner tonight?

451
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:02,228
[KIMIHITO]
Uh, actually, Miia's cooking,
so join us at your own risk...

452
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:04,064
By the way, where's your egg?

453
00:21:04,164 --> 00:21:05,566
[PAPI]
It's in the fridge.

454
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,267
[KIMIHITO]
That's a silly place for it.

455
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:08,502
What if someone mistakes
it for a‐(realize)

456
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:10,837
[ALL]
(mortified)

457
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,038
[SUU]
(huh?)

458
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,607
Tonight's dinner is my
specialty!

459
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:16,943
I hope everyone likes
boiled eggs!

460
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,912
[KASEGI]
That damn kid!

461
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:21,815
He destroyed the harpy egg,
my camera, AND the rare
footage!

462
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:25,752
[KASEGI]
I better collect some more
thread before I go broke.
(frustrated under)

463
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:30,557
[RACHNELA]
Somebody's busy. Shall I lend a
hand? I have several.

464
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:32,492
[KASEGI]
Shut your yap!

465
00:21:32,593 --> 00:21:36,329
Don't go getting cocky
just because your thread's
a hot seller!

466
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:37,864
And stop spinning webs
everywhere!

467
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,601
Can't you keep 'em in one
place, huh?!

468
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:42,468
[RACHNELA]
Keep them in one place?
(chuckle)

469
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:44,137
[KASEGI]
(mmff!) (muffled struggles)

470
00:21:44,237 --> 00:21:46,306
[RACHNELA]
You mean like this?

471
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:50,210
[RACHNELA]
Anyone who'd throw away
3 million is either too
kind or up to something.

472
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:55,081
Which makes me
a little bit concerned...
not to mention intrigued.

473
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:59,920
[RACHNELA]
(giggle)
Now I will have to investigate.

474
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:35,148
[SMITH]
Say hello to a special force
made of exclusively non‐human
species

475
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,817
to punish non‐human criminals

476
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:39,520
in accordance with the
Interspecies Exchange Bill.

477
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,725
[SMITH]
We are... MONster's New Law!
