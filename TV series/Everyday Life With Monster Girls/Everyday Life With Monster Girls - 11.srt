1
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,563
(street chatter)

2
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:37,998
[TIO]
(squeal)

3
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:42,435
Those clothes are totally
cute!... Ooh, I wanna buy them
all!

4
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,838
[KIMIHITO]
Jeez, Tionishia!... What's the
hurry?!

5
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:50,343
[TIO]
(halt)Hey!... Didn't I tell you
to call me Tio instead?

6
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,613
[TIO]
(excited) Wow, those are some

7
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,915
yummy‐looking desserts!‐ Let's
go try some!

8
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:56,116
[KIMIHITO]
(screaming)T‐time out!

9
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:59,385
[TIO]
Ooh, ANM48's new single just

10
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:01,121
came out!‐ I gotta go buy it
right now!

11
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:06,927
[KIMIHITO]
(panting)

12
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:10,864
[ZOMBINA]
Jeez, Romeo, how can you live
through that?

13
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,834
[KIMIHITO]
I guess I'm just used to it.

14
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,369
[ZOMBINA]
Oh, by the way...

15
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,005
...you're going on a hot date
with us today.

16
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,674
[KIMIHITO]
Huh?

17
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,776
[ZOMBINA]
Check this out.

18
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,880
[KIMIHITO]
Oh great, another creepy letter.

19
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,549
I will grant you death...

20
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:33,286
'Til death do us part forever,
we'll share an empty dream.

21
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,590
At the end of your short life, I
will bring death upon you.

22
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,460
I shall send you into
everlasting hell and
eternal darkness.

23
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:43,630
This life is a mirage
disappearing like the wind.

24
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,367
I am the messenger of
darkness. From D.

25
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,203
This one's more like a
depressing love letter.

26
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,905
[ZOMBINA]
So Maybe D's an emo kid.

27
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,640
[TIO]
It's almost like a love poem!

28
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,209
[MANAKO]
I agree, I think it's very
romantic.

29
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:59,312
[KIMIHITO]
So uh.. why am I taking you guys
out?...

30
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,015
I haven't heard anything
from Smith about this

31
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,952
[ZOMBINA]
Because it's our day off and we
want you to spoil us, you dummy

32
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,153
[KIMIHITO]
Huh?!

33
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,622
[ZOMBINA]
I mean, jeez! All we do is

34
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,456
watch you take those other girls
out

35
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,693
all over town and have the
time of your lives!

36
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,996
I just can't take it anymore!...
What about me?!

37
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,699
[KIMIHITO]
Seriously?
[ZOMBINA] I'm so fed up with
this stupid

38
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,003
surveillance mission! Why can't
we be done with it already?!

39
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,872
[KIMIHITO]
Kinda seems like they're not
really doing anything though...

40
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,473
[ZOMBINA](Under) make googly
eyes at each other all day

41
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,243
[MANAKO] I don't really mind
it... A job's a job.

42
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,313
[ZOMBINA](Under) are you trying
to rub it in our face or
something?!

43
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,915
[KIMIHITO] Hey
wait.. Doppel's not here.

44
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,551
[MANAKO]
She said this was boring, so she
went home.

45
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:40,453
[ZOMBINA]
We're gonna catch that perp
today, no matter what!

46
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,656
Thanks
for the fake date, jerkface!

47
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:49,596
[TIO]
Well? Whatcha think?... Huh?...
It's super pretty, right?

48
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:53,066
[KIMIHITO]
Um... It probably looks okay...
I think.

49
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:58,972
[TIO]
Hey! You're not even looking at
me! Darling pay attention!

50
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,776
[KIMIHITO]
Uh... well... don't you... think
it's kinda full?

51
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:05,378
[TIO]
What?!.. Excuse me, but I'm very
self‐conscious

52
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,214
about my
height!.. You don't have to be
rude! Hmph

53
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,850
[KIMIHITO]
That's not what I meant!

54
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,717
[TIO]
Ah!

55
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:11,618
[KIMIHITO]
(huh?)

56
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,220
[TIO]
Argh, I can't get it off

57
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,622
my butt's too big!

58
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,191
[TIO]
Mr. Boyfriend, help me!

59
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,727
[KIMIHITO]
What?!

60
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:21,928
[TIO]
(straining)

61
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,931
[KIMIHITO]
Don't strain yoursel. Try
to relax.

62
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:28,602
Take a deep breath... I'll pull
it off as you breathe out.

63
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:29,469
[TIO]
Okay!

64
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,171
[KIMIHITO]
I'll step outside

65
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,373
when it's
about to come off. (tug)

66
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,242
[KIMIHITO]
(shock x2)

67
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:41,548
[TIO]
(clueless)(shriek)

68
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,684
[TIO]
(dramatic crying)

69
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,586
[KIMIHITO]
I'm really sorry...

70
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:48,354
I didn't
think it would come off that
easily.

71
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,556
[TIO]
That's not it...

72
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,491
I wanted this skirt really
bad!...

73
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:55,361
But they don't carry it
in my size!

74
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,799
[TIO] (sob) I don't wanna give
up on it yet!

75
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,201
[KIMIHITO]
That's all?

76
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,005
[KIMIHITO]
Hey... I could always adjust the
size, you know.

77
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:09,342
[KIMIHITO]
(startled)Miia usually buys
human clothes...

78
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,878
Then I alter
them to fit her.

79
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:12,979
A skirt should be easy.

80
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,981
[TIO]
(sniffle)That's great!...

81
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,182
Thank you!

82
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,450
I didn't know you were so handy!

83
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,452
You're the best boyfriend ever!

84
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,658
[KIMIHITO]
(gasp for air, into dizzy)

85
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:27,528
[ZOMBINA]
Hey, lover boy, can you hear me?

86
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:28,795
[KIMIHITO]
Zombina?

87
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,532
[ZOMBINA]
See anybody suspicious?

88
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:34,000
[KIMIHITO]
Nope... nobody so far.

89
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,238
[ZOMBINA]
(laugh)He's probably scared
Tio'll squash him!

90
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,740
[TIO]
Hey, that's mean!

91
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,108
[ZOMBINA]
Then it's time I took over!

92
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,646
(movie theater chatter)

93
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:47,914
[ZOMBINA]
Man, zombie movies are awesome!

94
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,618
Just the right combination of
casual pleasure and devastating
fear!

95
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:57,123
I think the ones in that movie
look a little too lively though.
I mean, they're DEAD.

96
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:00,026
[KIMIHITO]
I dunno, you're a zombie and
you're pretty lively.

97
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:05,265
[ZOMBINA]
(laugh)That's true, but I'm a
special case, 'cause... hm?

98
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,901
[KIMIHITO]
(surprised)(nervous looking)

99
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:11,505
[WALLA: General]
(screams, terror at disembodied
hand)

100
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,743
[ZOMBINA]
Hey, not bad.

101
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,345
So you're good at cooking AND
sewing, huh?

102
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:22,516
[KIMIHITO]
Sorry this thread's kinda cheap.

103
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,419
[ZOMBINA]
You don't seem grossed out.

104
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,721
[KIMIHITO]
Huh?

105
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,489
[ZOMBINA]
Well, most guys can't handle all

106
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,957
the gore... They always make a

107
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,126
face like they're
gonna throw up.

108
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,862
Are you into gory stuff or what?

109
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,599
[KIMIHITO]
Nah... I'd probably freak out if

110
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,234
I ever saw a dead body or
something like that...

111
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:46,139
But you... well, you're just
YOU. You don't gross me out at
all.

112
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,341
[ZOMBINA]
(surprised)(grin)

113
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,544
[ZOMBINA]
What kinda weird answer is
that?!

114
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:51,745
[KIMIHITO]
(confused)

115
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,847
[ZOMBINA]
What did he mean by that?

116
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:57,283
For a second I thought my heart
would start beating again.

117
00:06:57,383 --> 00:07:02,388
But hey, if that's where this is
going, might as well have a
little fun with him.

118
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:06,560
[KIMIHITO]
(hm?)Hey, you dropped something.

119
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,796
[KIMIHITO]
(freak out)(trembling)

120
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:13,433
[ZOMBINA]
Whoopsie!... The stitches around
my boob came off too.

121
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,035
Mind patching me up?

122
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,469
[KIMIHITO]
(panic)

123
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,606
[ZOMBINA] (humming)
[KIMIHITO] (nervous stitching)

124
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:22,442
[ZOMBINA]
Oh yeah, he's losing it.

125
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:23,810
[KIMIHITO]
A‐am I hurting you?

126
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,746
[ZOMBINA]
No way, I'm a zombie, remember?‐

127
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,748
I can't feel any pain. (realize)

128
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:31,484
But I can still FEEL things, so
try not to be too rough with me.

129
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:36,122
[KIMIHITO]
Uh, okay... Well, I'm gonna sew
the underside now, so...

130
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,191
[ZOMBINA]
(gasp)(shriek)

131
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,360
[KIMIHITO] Ah!.. I'm sorry I'm
sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm
sorry I'm sorry

132
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,898
[ZOMBINA]
(laugh)Calm down, Casanova, I'm
just pulling your leg!

133
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,868
[ZOMBINA]
I really did feel that though...

134
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,737
I still can't believe he's not
weirded out by this...

135
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:54,407
Most people wouldn't want to sew
the boob back on a dead girl.

136
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:55,942
[KIMIHITO]
Zombina!
[ZOMBINA] (huh?)

137
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,812
[KIMIHITO]
I think you're bleeding!... Are
you okay?

138
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:01,682
[ZOMBINA]
Huh?... I don't see
blood...(hm?)

139
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:05,686
[KIMIHITO]
(dazed)(nose bleed)

140
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:06,987
[ZOMBINA]
(burst out laughing)

141
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,889
[KIMIHITO]
What are you laughing at?!

142
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,658
[ZOMBINA]
Ah, you're killing me! I'm in
stitches! (laughing)

143
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:14,928
[MANAKO]
sorry to interrupt, but it's my
turn.

144
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:18,565
(park chatter)

145
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,542
[KIMIHITO]
Listen... Manako?

146
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,744
[MANAKO]
Ah!‐ Yes?.. What is it?

147
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,548
[KIMIHITO]
This is a date, right?... Let's
walk a little closer.

148
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,382
[MANAKO]
Oh! I'm sorry!

149
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,218
[KIMIHITO]
And that hat... It's kinda

150
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:41,287
covering your whole face... Are
you sure you can see?

151
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:42,422
[MANAKO]
(impact)(reeling)

152
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,157
[KIMIHITO]
Guess not.

153
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,193
[MANAKO]
(impact)(impact)

154
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,162
[KIMIHITO]
Whoa.. are you okay?!

155
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:52,699
[MANAKO]
(pain)I'm fine... This is
normal.

156
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,970
Monoeyes don't have much depth
perception up close. Um...

157
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,304
[KIMIHITO]
(huh?)

158
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,706
[MANAKO]
If you don't mind...

159
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:00,774
I'd like
it if we could

160
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,308
go somewhere more
private.

161
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,077
[KIMIHITO]
Ah... you mean, like...?

162
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:07,614
[MANAKO]
It's just that... I'm not so
fond of crowds.

163
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,983
[KIMIHITO]
Oh, right. Sure.

164
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,357
[KIMIHITO]
Is green tea okay?

165
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:20,493
[MANAKO]
Yes... thank you so much.

166
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:24,464
[KIMIHITO]
So big crowds wear you out, huh?

167
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:29,636
[MANAKO]
He really is a nice person. Even
to someone he doesn't know that
well.

168
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,338
That must be why he gets along
with all those girls.

169
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:36,076
But what if it's all just
pretend?

170
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:39,880
What if he thinks we're strange,
or scary, or bad?

171
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,818
I can tell by the look in
someone's eyes.

172
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,388
When I look at people, they
always look away.

173
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:55,295
In fact, he doesn't look at me
either. He must not care about
me at all.

174
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,164
[MANAKO]
Mr. Boyfriend?
[KIMIHITO] (hm?)

175
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,200
[MANAKO]
Would you please look at me for
a moment?

176
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,768
[KIMIHITO]
Sure.

177
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,608
[MANAKO]
(amazed)

178
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:12,646
[MANAKO]
(gasp)

179
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,380
[KIMIHITO]
Huh?What's wrong?

180
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,750
[MANAKO]
Ah!.. Nothing, I was just...
well, I...(nervous under)

181
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,985
[KIMIHITO]
Do I have something on my face,
or...?

182
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:23,389
[MANAKO]
Oh no... not at all... Could
you... perhaps...(scared)

183
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,191
[MANAKO]
Please don't look at me!

184
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,294
[KIMIHITO]
Huh?! But you just told me to...

185
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,431
[MANAKO]
(gasp)You, over there!... You've
been following us!

186
00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:33,934
[MANAKO]
Who are you?!

187
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,401
[KIMIHITO]
Hey!... Wait up‐(startled)

188
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,303
[ZOMBINA]
Gotcha! Woohoo!

189
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,973
[DOPPEL]
(stunned x2)(run)

190
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,676
[KIMIHITO]
(surprised)(look up)(shocked)

191
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:45,946
[TIO]
Stand back!(throw)

192
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,083
[DOPPEL]
(startled)

193
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,954
[DOPPEL]
(fall)

194
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:55,789
[ZOMBINA]
Awesome!‐ Now we can FINALLY

195
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,357
be done with this lame job!

196
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,792
[TIO]
This is wonderful!

197
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:02,462
[ZOMBINA]
Now... say hello to the
famous... D?

198
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:03,864
[ZOMBINA][TIO][MANAKO]
Doppel?!

199
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:06,332
[DOPPEL]
Zombina... those tranquilizer

200
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,835
darts sure pack a punch...

201
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:16,342
[DOPPEL]
Well, he wasn't gonna hook up
with anybody on his own,

202
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:19,680
so Smith and I made a plan...
We thought if we wrote a scary

203
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,948
letter and made it seem like his
life was in danger,

204
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:25,786
it might force him to go ahead
and pick someone... So, did it
work?

205
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:27,120
[ZOMBINA]
Not exactly.

206
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,256
[MANAKO]
He just got closer to EVERYONE.

207
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,959
[DOPPEL]
Great, you mean I did all that
work for nothing?

208
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,695
[ZOMBINA]
Jeez, Doppel.. Couldn't you have

209
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,496
at least told us what you were
up to?

210
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:41,334
[DOPPEL]
Well, I could have... but that's
no fun... Sorry!

211
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,636
I can't believe you guys worked

212
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:45,171
your butts off and you never
knew it was me.

213
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,508
[ZOMBINA][MANAKO]
Well, she IS a doppelganger...

214
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:49,475
I guess this is what she
does best.

215
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,845
[DOPPEL]
But hey, think of it this way.
[ZOMBINA][MANAKO] (huh?)

216
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:55,148
[DOPPEL]
You guys all had a good time
today, right?

217
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,919
[MANAKO]
I suppose...

218
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,555
[DOPPEL]
Manako, why are you blushing?

219
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:03,890
[MANAKO]
Ah... because... you see,

220
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,893
nobody's ever treated me like a
normal girl before.

221
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,429
[MANAKO]
I'm a little embarrassed.

222
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,998
[TIO]
Yeah, that guy's got a really
big heart...

223
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,001
He doesn't treat us
different because of looks.

224
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,538
[ZOMBINA]
I know what you mean...

225
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:22,208
I guess
to him... we really ARE just
normal girls, aren't we?

226
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:29,215
Now that I think about it, that
second letter wasn't like the
first one at all.

227
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:32,085
[TIO]
Right, it sounded like a poem.

228
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,520
[MANAKO]
I didn't know you had such a way

229
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,923
with words, Doppel... It was
wonderful.

230
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:39,860
[KIMIHITO]
(surprised)

231
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,394
[DOPPEL]
Second letter?

232
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,701
Nah, I only sent him one.

233
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,369
[MANAKO][TIO][ZOMBINA]
(huh?)

234
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:58,111
[KIMIHITO]
I'm home!

235
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,180
[MIIA]
Oh hi, Darling!... Come in!

236
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,783
Did you find out who wrote you
that mean letter?

237
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:07,353
[KIMIHITO]
Uhh... maybe... I think... it's
her.

238
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,190
[MIIA]
(gasp)(scream)

239
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,892
[MIIA]
Darling.. W‐w‐what are you
thinking?‐

240
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:13,860
Why'd you bring a
scary headless ghost woman home?

241
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,028
[CEREA]
I quite agree!

242
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,897
[MIIA]
Get back!.. She's dangerous!

243
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:20,133
[KIMIHITO]
(startled) Hey, wait a
sec‐whooaaaa!

244
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:24,404
[MIIA]
(wincing, into look up)(gasp)

245
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:28,809
[MIIA]
(scream)

246
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:31,444
[MIIA]
(groan)No head...

247
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:35,415
[MIIA]
Just a spine, and a throat,
and...(groaning under)

248
00:13:35,516 --> 00:13:38,151
[CEREA]
Master... I hate to question
you,

249
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:40,887
but who is this girl and
how did you meet her?

250
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:45,458
[KIMIHITO]
Well... actually...
I don't really know.

251
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,734
All I know is she misplaced her
head somehow.

252
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,637
[RACHNELA]
That's not the sort of thing
that's easy to lose...

253
00:13:56,737 --> 00:14:01,074
[KIMIHITO]
Yeah... I know it's weird,
but... I couldn't leave her.

254
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:05,111
[RACHNELA][CEREA]
She's not a stray dog...

255
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,480
[KIMIHITO]
Anyway, I'm gonna go look for
her head now.

256
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:08,915
[CEREA]
At this hour?!

257
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,984
[RACHNELA]
It's rather dark... Wait 'til
morning.

258
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:14,320
[KIMIHITO]
Somewhere out in town.. a girl's
head

259
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,723
is lost and scared. I gotta
help.

260
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,592
[CEREA](Under)
(blush)

261
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,727
[CEREA]
Then allow me to assist you!

262
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,295
[KIMIHITO]
Huh? You want to help?

263
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,798
[MERO]
There's no need to aimlessly
search

264
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,667
the city all by yourself,
Master.

265
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:27,934
PAPI
Yeah, let me come too!

266
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,070
[KIMIHITO]
Thanks a lot, you guys...

267
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,872
Okay,
we should get going now.

268
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:35,341
[MIIA]
(gasp) W‐wait, you can't go
without me!

269
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,843
[RACHNELA]
Suu and I will stay here and

270
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:40,213
keep an eye on Little Miss
Headless.(smirk)

271
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:48,889
PAPI
(sigh) There's not really enough
light to see anything here...

272
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,157
[MERO]
(surface)Nothing so far...

273
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,493
I'll
let you know if I find anything.

274
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:57,030
[KIMIHITO]
Sounds good... Be careful in the
dark!

275
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,499
[CEREA]
Any luck here, Master?

276
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,137
[KIMIHITO]
Nah, just a bunch of trash. Hey,
where's Miia?

277
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,939
[MIIA] (scream)
[KIMIHITO][CEREA] (startled)

278
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,674
[MIIA]
(cowering)

279
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,109
[KIMIHITO]
What's wrong?!

280
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:14,447
[KIMIHITO]
It's fine, Miia... it's just a
mannequin head.

281
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:18,384
[MIIA]
(ugly sob)I don't think I can
do this, Darling!

282
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,187
I don't wanna look for a head!
We don't even know

283
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,591
that she HAS a head! I mean,
she didn't have a neck!

284
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:26,159
[CEREA]
You're THAT frightened?

285
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,194
[KIMIHITO]
Wow, Miia... I had no idea you

286
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,864
were this easily freaked out.

287
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:32,198
[CEREA]
She's right though.

288
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,935
We'd better
find it quick and get back home.

289
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:38,071
But remember, if it's still
alive...

290
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,807
it might come flying
at us out of nowhere.

291
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:43,810
RACIST GUY RACIST GIRL
(scream)

292
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,378
[KIMIHITO]
But now that we're here,

293
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,881
if someone else finds it,
it'll look like we dumped it.

294
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,416
[KIMIHITO]
We might end up as murder
suspects.

295
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:52,118
[MIIA]
(big scream)

296
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,521
[KIMIHITO]
(look up)

297
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,189
[MIIA]
(dazed)

298
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,992
[KIMIHITO]
Okay, guess Miia found it.

299
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:05,298
[KIMIHITO]
(surprised)(stunned)

300
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,734
[CEREA]
I'll take her elsewhere and calm
her down.

301
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:11,805
I'm sorry to put you out, but
you'll have to handle the head.

302
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:14,074
[KIMIHITO]
Uh... sure, no problem...

303
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:17,043
I wonder if it's alive.

304
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:22,115
Well, the body's still moving,
so I assume...

305
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,988
Uh, hey... You're not dead...
are you?

306
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,723
You hurt or anything?

307
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:36,029
Is she ignoring me? Maybe she
can't talk without her body.

308
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:38,899
Anyway, let's go home.

309
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,601
[LALA]
Do not touch me so casually.

310
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:42,235
[KIMIHITO]
(panic)

311
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,370
[LALA]
I am a Dullahan...

312
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,808
the harvester of spirits and
the harbinger of death.

313
00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:52,913
It seems you are caring for my
body. You have my gratitude.

314
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,781
[KIMIHITO]
You're... welcome?

315
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:59,720
[LALA]
I regret that I was forced to
appear to you in this form.

316
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,455
[KIMIHITO]
Huh? Her head's different from
her body.

317
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:05,726
I thought she was the
clumsy type.

318
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:08,428
[LALA]
Since I am being pursued by the
Organization,

319
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,096
I know my options
are limited.

320
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,598
[KIMIHITO]
By the who?

321
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,801
[LALA]
However, as long as I remain in
this state,

322
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,970
I cannot exercise
the power of death.

323
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,072
So, human.
[KIMIHITO]
(huh?)

324
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:22,543
[LALA]
I will now permit you to touch
my flesh.

325
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:24,511
Offer up your own body as my

326
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:27,380
temporary host, so that you may
do my bidding.

327
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,483
Return me to my completed state
and allow

328
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:34,087
the glorious darkness
to bless me once more.

329
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:37,558
[KIMIHITO]
Uh... sorry?

330
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:41,728
[LALA]
(annoyed) Insolent mortal...
Such arrogance!

331
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,163
I am death incarnate...

332
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:45,599
and you
are merely a pathetic human...

333
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:48,468
You must obey me and help
restore my power!

334
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,571
[KIMIHITO]
Yeah, still don't get it.

335
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:53,306
[LALA]
Um... listen... I‐I just want

336
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,810
you to take me back to my body,
okay?... That's all.

337
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:01,081
Being a disembodied head... well
it's... kinda tricky...

338
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,617
[KIMIHITO]
(startled)Oh, that's all?!

339
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:05,519
[KIMIHITO]
No problem.

340
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:08,522
Hey... about that threatening
letter you sent me

341
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:10,924
What exactly were
you trying to do?

342
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:13,860
[LALA]
I told you, I am a Dullahan,

343
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,699
bringer of death. I have only
one reason to make contact with
the living.

344
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,134
[LALA] (gasp)
[KIMIHITO] Whoa!.. What's
wrong?!

345
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:24,304
[LALA]
(sexy gasping)

346
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:27,941
[LALA]
I‐it would seem that someone is
violating my body

347
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,342
...This is
humiliating...

348
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,212
[KIMIHITO]
Violating...?(realize)

349
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,548
[RACHNELA]
Aww... That's no fun; I can't

350
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:37,250
see how she's reacting without
her head...

351
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,187
I have to admit, this is getting
bizarre even for my taste.

352
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:45,792
Ah, well... What's it matter?...
She's headless, but the body's
not too bad.

353
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:49,495
[KIMIHITO]
(panic)
Oh, thanks a lot, Rachne!...

354
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:52,398
So
THAT'S why you wanted to stay
back at the house!

355
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,134
[LALA](Under)
(pant x2 pleasured)

356
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,703
[KIMIHITO]
(notice)Quiet!

357
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,072
[SATSUKE]
This is way too dark and
scary...

358
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:03,109
But somebody said they
heard a lady screaming around
here...

359
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:04,578
So I guess I gotta...

360
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:06,246
[LALA](Under)
(extended muffled moans)

361
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:07,848
[KIMIHITO]
There is NO way to explain this

362
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:09,282
that won't get me in trouble.

363
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,918
I know this sounds bad, but
please don't make noise.

364
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:14,287
[LALA]
(gasp x2)

365
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,289
[LALA]
(gasp)

366
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:22,128
(panting)(bite down)

367
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:24,197
[LALA]
(gasp x2)Oh...

368
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:31,371
[KIMIHITO]
(on edge)

369
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:34,374
[KIMIHITO] Huh?... What's up?...

370
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,610
You uh... got quiet all of a
sudden.

371
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,781
[LALA]
I'm not sure... The violation
must've reached its conclusion.

372
00:19:40,881 --> 00:19:42,749
[KIMIHITO]
(huh?) I wonder...

373
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,386
[RACHNELA]
Agh... She caught me off guard.

374
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:49,489
[KIMIHITO]
I should probably thank Suu for
that when I see her.

375
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,392
Wait... Oh no...

376
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,561
[LALA]
(startled)(gasping)

377
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:56,496
[KIMIHITO]
Dammit! There's no one there to
stop her!

378
00:19:56,597 --> 00:20:03,403
[LALA]
(moan)So slimy... It's all over
me!

379
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:10,110
SATSUKE
Freeze!
[KIMIHITO] (startled)

380
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,745
[SATSUKE]
Don't move!... I'll shoot
you!

381
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:13,446
You don't wanna mess
with the law, pal!

382
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:15,181
Both of you put your hands
up!...

383
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,217
Oh wait, one of you
doesn't have hands...

384
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,820
What kinda
messed‐up murder
scene‐(headbutted)

385
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,725
[PAPI]
Ow ow ow ow!... I couldn't see
where I was flying...

386
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:27,093
[CEREA]
What happened here, Master?

387
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:28,995
[MIIA]
Darliiiiing!

388
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:30,130
[LALA]
Well done, human.

389
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,098
[MIIA]
DID THAT HEAD JUST TALK?!

390
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,601
[KIMIHITO]
Aaagh! Everybody calm down!

391
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,542
[LALA]
(grunt x2)

392
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:43,343
[KIMIHITO]
Finally back to normal.

393
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:47,614
[RACHNELA]
Perhaps I should tie your head
on so you don't lose it again.

394
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:49,215
Is that a no?

395
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:50,851
[MERO]
I made tea for everyone.

396
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:52,686
Would
you like some, milady?

397
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,922
[LALA]
(nod)
Yes, I'm curious to see if

398
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:59,225
mortal beverages can quench my
otherworldly thirst.

399
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:01,227
[CEREA]
Oh, so you can drink normally?

400
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:03,564
[LALA]
Of course.

401
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:06,767
[CEREA]
That's unconventional. Oops, too
hot.

402
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:09,169
[PAPI]
Wow, cool!‐ Do you eat like that
too?

403
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,170
[LALA]
Indeed.

404
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,404
[RACHNELA]
Wait, dear...

405
00:21:11,505 --> 00:21:12,873
I think you forgot
something important.

406
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:15,475
[CEREA]
I know a little something about
Dullahans.

407
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:17,277
[MIIA]
Dulla‐what?!

408
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:19,613
[CEREA]
The Dullahans are headless

409
00:21:19,713 --> 00:21:22,015
nights who appear to people on
the brink of death.

410
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,417
Like the Grim Reaper...
they harvest

411
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:28,321
the souls of the dead
and escort them to the
underworld.

412
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:29,823
[MIIA]
Reaper?!... No way!

413
00:21:29,923 --> 00:21:32,526
[MERO]
My, how tragic!‐ That sounds
like a fairy tale!

414
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:35,562
[RACHNELA]
Exactly; I thought Dullahans
were imaginary.

415
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:37,831
[KIMIHITO]
Yeah, says the giant spider.

416
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:42,903
Wait! So if she's here... that
means someone's about to die.

417
00:21:43,003 --> 00:21:46,540
[LALA]
Yes... Someone in this household
is knocking on death's door.

418
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,509
[KIMIHITO]
But how do you know‐(surprised)

419
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:53,814
[LALA]
It's you...You're going to
die... very soon.
