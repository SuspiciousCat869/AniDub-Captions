1
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,166
[MIIA]
The situation is dire!

2
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:39,566
[MIIA]
The Japanese government knows
about Suu,

3
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:43,700
the slime girl we've
been sheltering in this house.

4
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
[CEREA]
That's right...

5
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,966
It's us against the government.

6
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:47,166
What should we do?

7
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:48,600
[MIIA]
Officer Darling.

8
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,900
What do you recommend?

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,266
[KIMIHITO]
Um‐what are you asking me for?!

10
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:53,766
And why all of a sudden
are you on Suu's side?

11
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:57,266
[MIIA]
Why not?
I mean, it's not like a giant
drop of water

12
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:59,033
is gonna win
your love instead of me!

13
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:01,133
[CEREA]
Um‐as your servant,

14
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:02,400
I must support your decisions
to the end.

15
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,866
(doorbell)

16
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:06,366
[FOREMAN A]
Inter‐species Exchange
Security Service.

17
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:08,133
[KIMIHITO]
Coming!

18
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:10,066
(surprised)

19
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:11,100
[FOREMAN A]
Good to see you again, sir.

20
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,766
Please excuse us.

21
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:16,300
[KIMIHITO]
(speechless)

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,200
What the...?

23
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,833
[FOREMAN A]
Hey, you're hosting
a lot of people here...

24
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:24,200
That's awfully nice of you.

25
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,566
[KIMIHITO]
(confused)

26
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,233
Is this a room for Suu?

27
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:31,133
Wow, Ms. Smith can be
surprisingly generous sometimes.

28
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:35,333
[MIIA]
Okay, I think we'll
be safe out here.

29
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:38,300
[CEREA]
We should hide Suu
until this all blows over.

30
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,500
[PAPI]
Hey, are you sure it was okay
to leave Master behind?

31
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,766
[CEREA]
How could we forget
the most important thing?!

32
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:45,533
[MIIA]
This is bad! If we don't have
Darling with us,

33
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:48,300
then we're gonna
get arrested too!

34
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,633
[CEREA]
Hide!

35
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:54,266
[MIB A] Any luck?
[MIB B] Nope, can't find 'em.

36
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:57,600
[MIB A] Where did they go?
[MIB B] Let's try that way.

37
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,600
[MIB A]
Right.

38
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,733
[CEREA]
That was quick.

39
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,900
They're right on our tail.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,200
[PAPI] Aaaah!
[MIIA] Papi!

41
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:07,166
[PAPI]
(long discomfort)

42
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:08,666
[MIIA]
What happened?

43
00:03:08,766 --> 00:03:10,266
Suu was thirsty so I was gonna

44
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:13,266
share my water bottle, but...

45
00:03:13,366 --> 00:03:15,266
[MIIA]
I'm sure it'll dry soon, Papi;

46
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:16,533
just try to be quiet.

47
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:17,500
[PAPI]
(squeal)

48
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,366
[MIIA]
What did I just‐

49
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:19,666
[MIIA/CEREA]
(panic)

50
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,833
[SUU] (face‐sucking)

51
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:23,466
[PAPI] (mmmfff!)

52
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:26,466
[PAPI]
Suu! What are you doing to me?!

53
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,133
[SUU]
mm...

54
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:29,466
[PAPI]
(gasp)

55
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:32,366
[CEREA]
She's lapping up all the water.

56
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:34,300
[PAPI]
W‐wait a second, Suu!

57
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,766
If you want water that bad,
I can go get you some.

58
00:03:37,866 --> 00:03:40,333
You don't have to do that...

59
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:44,266
[PAPI]
C.. Cut it out... Suu...

60
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:47,000
If... you keep... that up...

61
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,266
I'm gonna...

62
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,900
[MIIA/CEREA]
So, if we get wet...

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
She'll do THAT?!

64
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,566
[KIMIHITO]
(running)

65
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,733
[KIMIHITO]
Aagh where did those four go?

66
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:04,000
Suu's getting her own room;
there was no reason to run away!

67
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,233
[MERO] (scream)
[KIMIHITO] (surprised)

68
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,066
[MERO]
Ah! Please help me!

69
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,566
[MERO]
I'm out of control

70
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,833
I'm going to crash!

71
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:11,833
Someone please!

72
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:13,200
[MERO]
(gasp)

73
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,266
[KIMIHITO]
(mmff...)

74
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:25,166
[KIMIHITO]
Thank god for airbags,
am I right?

75
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,100
[MERO]
Oh! Are you alright, sir?

76
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,666
Would you like me to call
for an ambulance?!

77
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:30,600
[KIMIHITO]
Oh no, I'll be just fine...

78
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,133
This kinda stuff happens
to me all the time.

79
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,800
[MERO]
I could have been seriously
injured...

80
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,100
Thank you for saving me.

81
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:41,200
My name is Mero...

82
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,033
I hope you'll forgive
my rudeness.

83
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:45,233
I'd almost forgotten
to introduce myself!

84
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,700
[KIMIHITO]
That's okay... I'm Kimihito.

85
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,666
[KIMIHITO]
I should probably get going
though...

86
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:52,433
I kinda lost the
exchange students I'm hosting.

87
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:57,900
[MERO]
That so? I don't suppose you're
looking for a centaur, a harpy,
and a lamia, by chance?

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,533
I ran into those three
not long ago.

89
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,100
[CEREA]
This is a problem...

90
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,000
Who knew a dehydrated slime

91
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,666
would be so much trouble?

92
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,366
[MIIA]
They're still after us.
What's the plan?

93
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:12,600
[CEREA]
There isn't much we can do...

94
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,900
We should wait for
a chance to relocate.

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,866
[MIIA]
Heh...

96
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:18,366
[CEREA]
What's that look for?

97
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:21,066
[MIIA]
Are you sure there
IS anywhere we can hide?

98
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,533
I mean, y'know since your butt
is so big and all...

99
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:26,733
[CEREA]
I'm not the one who's
20 feet long!

100
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,000
[MIIA]
Uh‐oh... Now look
what you did...

101
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,133
[CEREA]
Shh‐silence! It's not my fault;

102
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,033
what's a faucet
doing there anyway?!

103
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:37,233
[MIIA]
Wow, this is a lot of water.

104
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,233
[MIIA]
Your clothes are totally
soaked...

105
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,066
Looks like you wet yourself.

106
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,233
[CEREA]
(sigh)

107
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,766
[MIIA/CEREA]
(realize)

108
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,700
[CEREA]
Oh no... Suu!

109
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,500
[CEREA]
Leave me alone!

110
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,166
Just drink from the tap!

111
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:52,700
[CEREA]
(moan, muffled struggling)

112
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,100
[MIIA]
Keep your voice down!

113
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,700
They might hear you!

114
00:05:56,766 --> 00:05:58,266
Do your best to stay calm!

115
00:05:58,366 --> 00:05:59,966
She'll probably stop
just as soon

116
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:01,633
as she sucks up
all the water!

117
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,733
[CEREA]
(muffled squeal)

118
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,033
(more muffled moans)

119
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,400
[MIIA]
This thing is really thirsty!

120
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:14,233
[CEREA]
(extended muffled struggling)

121
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:17,033
[CEREA]
(release)

122
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:19,633
[MIIA]
Centorea!

123
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:21,766
[MERO]
(worried)

124
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:25,366
[KIMIHITO]
Whoa! There's a really weird
vibe coming from over there!

125
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:26,966
[SUU]
(growl)

126
00:06:27,066 --> 00:06:29,233
[MIIA]
(hiss)

127
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,166
[MIIA]
There's no turning back now...

128
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,333
It's either you or me.

129
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:37,000
[MIIA]
But seriously,
just drink from the tap.

130
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,133
[SUU]
(menacing)

131
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,400
[MIIA]
(gulp)

132
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,066
[KIMIHITO]
What are you doing? Eehh...

133
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,800
[MIIA]
Ah! Darling! Well, uh...

134
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,733
Suu was trying to‐ (gasp)

135
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,900
[SUU]
(lick x3)

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,466
[MIIA]
But I'm not even wet! (ggh!)

137
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:56,733
[SUU]
(lick)

138
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,700
[MIIA] Suu!
[KIMIHITO] (speechless)

139
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,066
[SUU]
(licking)

140
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,766
[MIIA]
(gasping)

141
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,966
[MIIA]
(big gasp) Oh no...
how does she know my weakness?

142
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:11,966
[MIIA]
(pleasured sound) Darling...

143
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:14,433
please don't.. look...

144
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,400
[SUU]
(menacing)

145
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:23,166
[SUU]
(notice)

146
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:25,500
[MERO]
(surprised) You... want me too?

147
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,466
[SUU]
(lunge)

148
00:07:26,566 --> 00:07:27,633
[MERO]
(scared)

149
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:33,100
[KIMIHITO]
I told ya, I'm used to this.

150
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,633
[MERO]
(happy)

151
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:41,100
[FOREMAN A]
Okay, looks like we're
all done building your
waterproof room now.

152
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,333
[PAPI/SUU]
(happy)

153
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:44,366
[MIIA]
This is so unfair...

154
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:46,433
[CEREA]
So we did
all that work for nothing.

155
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,833
[SUU] (happy)
[PAPI] You get to stay, Suu!

156
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:53,266
[FOREMAN A]
We'll need to sign all these
papers by tomorrow morning.

157
00:07:53,366 --> 00:07:55,133
[SMITH] Well.
[KIMIHITO] (surprised)

158
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:57,166
[SMITH]
Seems the construction
is finished.

159
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:59,066
[KIMIHITO]
Ms. Smith!

160
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,566
You think you could maybe
NOT order construction work

161
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,566
without at least
telling me first?

162
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,233
[SUU] (happy)
[PAPI] Thanks for everything,
Ms. Smith!

163
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,466
I'm so happy Suu gets
to live with us now!

164
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:09,033
[SMITH]
There's something I want to say.

165
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:10,333
[SUU/PAPI/KIMIHITO]
(huh?)

166
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:12,200
[SMITH]
I wear a lot of hats.

167
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,133
Matching demi‐human exchange
students with families,

168
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:16,233
enforcing the Interspecies
Exchange Bill,

169
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,766
and implementing
new procedures,

170
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:19,300
and yet my salary never
increases.

171
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,700
Y'hear that! I work my butt off
and don't get paid crap!

172
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,866
[SMITH]
And now THIS?!

173
00:08:23,966 --> 00:08:26,100
I've had enough, I tell you!

174
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,800
[KIMIHITO/MIIA/CEREA]
Huuuuh?!

175
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,100
So as far as I'm concerned,
we don't have any new species

176
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,900
or illegal immigrants in this
house! Is that clear?!

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,166
[CEREA]
Can she do that?

178
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:35,666
[KIMIHITO]
Hhmmph...

179
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:36,800
[MIIA]
Well, good for you, Suu.

180
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,100
[SUU]
(smile)

181
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,066
[KIMIHITO]
Okay, but if she doesn't exist,

182
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,366
why'd you build her a room?

183
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:45,466
[SMITH]
Huh? It's not for her.

184
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:48,700
[MERO]
Greetings, everyone.

185
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:53,333
[MERO]
Oh my goodness,
it's a lovely evening, isn't it?

186
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,300
[KIMIHITO]
Huh? What are you doing here?

187
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,200
[SMITH]
I told you not to go outside
on your own...

188
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,366
Do you realize
how hard we had to look for you?

189
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:02,433
[MERO]
Yes, I do apologize...

190
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:05,333
It's just that I was
so excited to explore
this magnificent city.

191
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:09,600
[MERO]
And when I lost my way...
who should come to rescue me
but my new host...!

192
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,800
[MERO]
It must have been destiny!

193
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,566
[KIMIHITO]
Uh wait, your host?

194
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,766
Does that mean you're
going to be living here too?

195
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:17,033
[CEREA/MIIA]
(react)

196
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:18,366
[SMITH]
That's right, Darling...

197
00:09:18,466 --> 00:09:21,733
Meet the newest addition
to your happy home.

198
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,033

[ALL]
(stunned)

200
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:29,400
Hello there, my name is Meroune
Lorelei, and I'm a mermaid...

201
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,400
I'll be residing here starting
today as part of the home‐stay
program.

202
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,666
I'm pleased to make your
acquaintance... new master.

203
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,700
[MERO]
MonMusu!

204
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:51,066
[MERO/KIMIHITO]
MonMusu.

205
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,500
[KIMIHITO]
Will this be okay...

206
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,700
Miss Meroune?

207
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,333
Would you please call me Mero...
My dear Master?

208
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,966
[KIMIHITO]
Are you ready to go?

209
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:04,866
[MERO]
Yes... go ahead and take me.

210
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:08,100
[MIIA]
How dare you?!

211
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,466
[MIIA]
What is this?!
Are you two making out?!

212
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:12,133
[KIMIHITO]
Whoa... Miia, cut it out‐

213
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:16,833
[MIIA/MERO]
(fall)

214
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:19,933
[KIMIHITO] (stunned)
[MERO] (stunned)
[MIIA] (stunned)

215
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:21,733
[MERO]
Are you alright, Master?

216
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:25,566
[MIIA]
Back off, Fish Lips, I'm the one
who's supposed to fuss over him!

217
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,066
[CEREA]
(look)

218
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,966
[MIIA]
(ashamed)

219
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:31,566
[KIMIHITO]
(shocked)

220
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,800
[KIMIHITO]
What did you do that for?

221
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,966
All I did was pick her up
so I could take her upstairs.

222
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:38,933
[MIIA]
Um.. yeah, but you...

223
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:43,533
[CEREA]
Smith said she'd bring her a new
wheelchair as soon as she can.

224
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:45,800
[KIMIHITO]
I guess I'll carry her
until it gets here.

225
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,700
[MIIA]
But Darling!

226
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:50,066
[CEREA]
What is wrong with you?

227
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,666
She's just another
home‐stay like us.

228
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:53,766
[MIIA]
Yeah...

229
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:55,633
But she's also another rival

230
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:57,066
to win my Darling's heart!

231
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,133
I can't just let her get ahead!

232
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:00,866
[MIIA]
I mean, look at it this way...

233
00:11:00,966 --> 00:11:02,533
You never try to seduce him...

234
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:03,733
Papi's a birdbrain..

235
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,266
Suu's a sexy puddle!

236
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:06,666
Until she got here,

237
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,433
I was the obvious choice
to be Darling's bride!

238
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:11,566
Why don't you tell us
how you really feel, Miia...

239
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,900
Besides, you don't even know
if she's interested in him.

240
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,866
[MERO]
What a lovely home...

241
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:18,333
By the way, Master,

242
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:21,033
I don't suppose you have
a wife or perhaps a lover?

243
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:22,466
[MIIA]
That was quick!

244
00:11:22,566 --> 00:11:24,200
[KIMIHITO]
W‐why are you asking‐

245
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,933
[KIMIHITO/MERO]
(stumble)

246
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:27,500
[MERO]
(gasp)

247
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,800
[MIIA]
Hey! Excuse me! (hissing)

248
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,066
[KIMIHITO]
Don't be mad! I promise,
it was just an accident!

249
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,466
[KIMIHITO]
(huh?)

250
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,733
[MIIA]
You pervert! You just did that
on purpose, didn't you?!

251
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,000
[KIMIHITO]
(startled)
I didn't, I swear!

252
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,166
[MERO]
Actually... Mermaids' bodies are
covered in a layer of mucus

253
00:11:46,266 --> 00:11:48,366
that keeps us from drying
out on land...

254
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:53,366
Our clothes tend to slip off
easily because of it.

255
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:57,066
[MERO]
But... as long as it's you,
Master... well...

256
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,500
[MERO]
I don't mind.

257
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,233
[MIIA]
She's already making her move!

258
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,700
Stupid mermaid...

259
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,000
There's enough slimy things

260
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,333
in this house with Suu here!

261
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:08,966
[CEREA]
Oh, I guess that makes sense.

262
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:11,600
That must be why Suu attacked
her earlier.

263
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,100
[MIIA]
Come on, Suu,

264
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,266
I just thought of something
really fun we can do!

265
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:16,933
[KIMIHITO]
That's the guest bedroom...

266
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:18,266
And if we go over here
we'll find the...

267
00:12:18,366 --> 00:12:19,766
[MIIA] Darling!
[KIMIHITO] (hm?)

268
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:23,266
[MIIA]
Oh no... Don't look,
I'm way too embarrassed!

269
00:12:23,366 --> 00:12:26,666
I got covered in sticky slime
from playing with Suu!

270
00:12:26,766 --> 00:12:28,000
[MIIA]
You know what they say,

271
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,066
an eye for an eye,
and a slime for a slime!

272
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,833
[MIIA]
That's what you get for
trying to steal my man!

273
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:36,800
[KIMIHITO]
Oh, good thing I already got
the bath ready then...

274
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,366
Knock yourself out.

275
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:41,300
Darling, why do you have to be
so considerate?!

276
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,200
I love that about you,
but if this keeps up

277
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,200
it'll lead you straight
into her scaly arms!

278
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,800
[CEREA]
Miia... Don't you think

279
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,233
you might be overreacting?

280
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,666
[MERO] (rich girl laugh)
[MIIA] Of course not!

281
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:51,333
The ink's not even dry on her
homestay papers

282
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:53,533
and she's already making
goo‐goo eyes at Darling!

283
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:57,000
[MIIA]
That stuck‐up mermaid's gotta
have some kind of secret agenda!

284
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,633
Here's an idea!

285
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:01,600
Maybe I can freeze her out
before she gets too cozy!

286
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:05,066
[MIIA]
That'll teach ya...

287
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,733
Just 'cause you're a mermaid

288
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:10,533
doesn't mean y‐you can be..
ha‐half.. na‐naked!

289
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:14,100
[CEREA]
I'm starting to worry about her.

290
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,500
[KIMIHITO]
It's chilly in here...

291
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,066
Was it supposed to be cold
today?

292
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,666
How's it feel, Mero?

293
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:23,233
Great! Mermaids are highly
resistant to cold temperatures..

294
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,466
It doesn't bother me.

295
00:13:24,566 --> 00:13:26,266
[CEREA]
Don't pass out, Miia!

296
00:13:26,366 --> 00:13:27,500
You'll die in here!

297
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,000
[PAPI]
She's hibernating.

298
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,866
[KIMIHITO]
Oh, the AC's on.

299
00:13:30,966 --> 00:13:32,566
[MIIA]
(guilty)

300
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,900
[KIMIHITO]
Weird, now the heater's cranked
as high as it can go,

301
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,700
[KIMIHITO]
But it's not working...

302
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Maybe the battery's dead.

303
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,933
I'll be right back.

304
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:43,233
[MERO]
Alright.

305
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,533
[MIIA]
Now it's hot!

306
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:48,933
Get ready, you three!

307
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:50,200
It's time for all of us
to work together

308
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,800
to protect Darling's heart!

309
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,866
[CEREA]
Do you really have to
bring us into this Miia?!

310
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:57,766
[MIIA]
We're united by a common enemy!
You're on my side, right, Papi?

311
00:13:57,866 --> 00:14:00,333
[PAPI]
Hey, you wanna play
a game with me?

312
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:02,433
[MIIA]
Seriously?!

313
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:05,966
[MERO]
Tell me, Papi, does the master
have a woman in his life?

314
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:07,133
[PAPI]
(huh?)

315
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:10,433
Um... I don't really know...

316
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:14,000
[CEREA]
You seem oddly curious about
Master's relationship status...

317
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,766
Don't tell me you're
interested in him too?

318
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:18,733
[MERO]
Well it's.. embarrassing, but...

319
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:22,566
the story of The Little Mermaid
is quite popular among my kind.

320
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,100
[PAPI]
What's it about?

321
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,433
A young mermaid falls in love
with a human prince...

322
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,300
[MERO]
She trades her voice for
a pair of legs to be with him,

323
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,366
but in the end, her feelings
are not returned and
she turns into sea foam.

324
00:14:35,466 --> 00:14:37,433
[MERO]
It's such a sad story.

325
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:40,566
[MERO]
My people have a bit of a soft
spot for tragic romance...

326
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:47,166
In fact, I enjoy attending
operas and plays
about unrequited love.

327
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:49,133
[CEREA]
Operas and plays?

328
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:53,066
Wait, the way you act and speak,
not to mention your aura‐

329
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,566
is not like the average citizen.

330
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,366
Even Ms. Smith acted
unusually respectful

331
00:14:57,466 --> 00:14:59,633
when she spoke to you before.

332
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,533
[CEREA]
I wondered why that was.

333
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:06,866
[MIIA]
Ha! Nice going, Centorea!
I knew I could depend on you!

334
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:08,566
[MERO]
Oh, I understand...

335
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,266
You're saying YOU'RE the
Master's lover; is that right?

336
00:15:11,366 --> 00:15:12,500
[CEREA]
(shocked)

337
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,533
(stammering)

338
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:15,233
M‐M‐M‐Master's lover?!

339
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,033
Of course not, I'm only
a humble servant, that is all!

340
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:21,200
[MERO] It's just as they say.
[CEREA] (huh?)

341
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,000
I hear Centaurs are a famously
proud and noble species.

342
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,766
[MERO]
But you... I sense
there's something even
more valiant about you.

343
00:15:29,866 --> 00:15:33,100
[MERO]
Yes... You're just like a knight
of the Middle Ages

344
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,066
who's sworn full allegiance to
her master.

345
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:39,166
[CEREA]
She's so poised and
sophisticated. What is this?

346
00:15:39,266 --> 00:15:42,133
It's almost as if
I'm standing before a queen!

347
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,766
[CEREA]
(serious)

348
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:45,366
[MERO]
I never could have imagined that

349
00:15:45,466 --> 00:15:48,033
I would meet someone as
disciplined and heroic as you.

350
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:51,766
[MERO]
I am eternally grateful that
destiny brought us together...

351
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:53,233
Centorea.

352
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,066
[CEREA]
Uh‐thank you!

353
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,733
I trust you will always
fight with all your heart.

354
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,333
[CEREA]
Yes.. I swe‐(choked)

355
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:01,466
[MIIA]
Oh, snap out of it,
knight in shining armor!

356
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:03,433
[CEREA]
W‐what are you doing to me?!

357
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:05,700
[MIIA]
I don't care how special
you are!

358
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,700
You're still not gonna lay
one flipper on my Darling!
You got that?!

359
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,000
[MERO]
(chuckle)

360
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,733
That isn't my intention at all.

361
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,700
[MIIA]
(huh?)

362
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,400
[MERO]
I can assure you...

363
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,133
that's never going to happen.

364
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:22,633
[KIMIHITO]
Found 'em! Whoo,
it's hot in here.

365
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:23,533
[MERO]
(cough)

366
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:24,966
Uh...

367
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:27,166
Pardon me... Mermaids are
able to breathe on land

368
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:28,900
as long as our gills
are moist...

369
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,333
but I'm afraid the heater
is drying out the air.

370
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:33,400
[KIMIHITO]
Okay, I'll take you
to your room.

371
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,800
[MERO]
Thank you, Master,
you're very kind.

372
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,733
[KIMIHITO]
Miia, could you change
the batteries?

373
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,900
[MIIA]
(grumble)

374
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,233
[MIIA]
Arggggh, there's totally
something fishy about her!

375
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,433
[CEREA]
That's quite enough, Miia!
Let it go!

376
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:49,566
[CEREA]
(sigh) If you don't like what
Master's doing...

377
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,700
then you shouldn't have
broken her wheelchair!

378
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,100
[MIIA]
She's not the only one
who loves fairy tales, you know.

379
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,233
[CEREA]
(huh?)

380
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,000
[MIIA]
In all those stories,

381
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,533
the princess is rescued
by prince charming.
[YOUNG MIIA] (happy)

382
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:03,400
[MIIA]
He sweeps her up in his arms

383
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,666
and then they live
happily ever after.

384
00:17:05,766 --> 00:17:11,233
I always dreamed of
being carried like a princess
by my true love.

385
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,200
By MY prince charming.

386
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,833
[KIMIHITO/MIIA]
(happy chuckle)

387
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:19,200
But now, I have to watch him
carry HER around instead.

388
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,766
[CEREA]
I'm not sure that would
actually work, anyway.

389
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:23,866
[KIMIHITO]
(straining)

390
00:17:23,966 --> 00:17:25,000
Rgghh, stupid mermaid!

391
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,133
Prancing around in a bikini

392
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:27,533
to get his attentionnnnnnnnn!

393
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:29,600
[CEREA]
Why don't you wear
a swimsuit as well?

394
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,166
[MIIA]
(realize) (gasp)

395
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:38,866
[MERO]
Tell me honestly, do you really
not have a girlfriend?

396
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:43,700
[KIMIHITO]
Um‐no, I really don't...
Why is that so important?

397
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,066
[MERO]
Well, because...

398
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,366
[MIIA]
Don't mind me!

399
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:52,033
[KIMIHITO]
(shocked) (stammering under)

400
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:55,233
[MIIA]
Wow... isn't this a beautiful
pool?

401
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,366
[MIIA]
I've been wanting to try it out.

402
00:17:57,466 --> 00:17:58,533
Do you mind?

403
00:17:58,633 --> 00:17:59,600
[MERO]
No, not at all.

404
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,566
[MIIA]
Come with me, Darling.

405
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:02,866
Let's go for a swim.

406
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:04,833
[KIMIHITO]
(nervous) Uh, I don't know...

407
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:06,333
[MIIA]
It's anyone's game now!

408
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:08,966
Actually, I'm showing more skin,
so I'm winning!

409
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:11,600
Better luck next time, princess!

410
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,933
[CEREA]
U‐um...

411
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:14,133
[MIIA] What's the matter?

412
00:18:14,233 --> 00:18:16,066
Why don't you come in too?

413
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,300
[CEREA]
Uh.. well... you see...

414
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,200
[MERO]
There's no need to be shy.

415
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,000
[CEREA]
Ah... alright... (shy)

416
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,733
[MIIA]
Hey! you're not supposed to be
all sexy too!

417
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:32,266
[CEREA]
Excuse me! It's not my fault
your swimsuit was too small!

418
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:34,833
[MIIA]
Um... What's going on
with that coverup;

419
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:36,133
where'd you get that from?

420
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:37,266
[CEREA]
Well... actually

421
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,566
I just took some sheets and‐

422
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,533
[CEREA]
Agh! Papi, what are you doing?!

423
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:44,533
[PAPI]
I've been looking all over for
Suu. Thought maybe she was here.

424
00:18:44,633 --> 00:18:46,466
[CEREA]
Why would she be in there?!

425
00:18:46,566 --> 00:18:50,433
[CEREA]
(gasp)

426
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:51,200
I have to go!

427
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,766
[PAPI] (trampled)

428
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,466
Why did those two even
come in here?

429
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:57,733
Anyway, now that
they're out of the way‐

430
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:58,933
[KIMIHITO]
(stumble)

431
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:01,166
[MIIA]
(huh?) (gasp)

432
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,200
[MIIA]
Darling! I know...

433
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,233
She MEANT to pull him in!

434
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,733
[MIIA]
Leave Darling alone!

435
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,033
Wow, it's deep...

436
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:15,100
[MIIA]
And cold...

437
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,433
[MIIA]
D‐Darling...

438
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:23,633
Oh no, my body temperature's
dropping... I can't move...

439
00:19:23,733 --> 00:19:29,133
Instead of rescuing him,
I'm going to... N... no...

440
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,700
[KIMIHITO]
Miia!

441
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,700
[MIIA]
(surprised)

442
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:44,600
Darling...

443
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:52,900
[MIIA]
(panting)

444
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,766
[MIIA]
(pant) Thank you...
for saving me... That was‐

445
00:19:56,866 --> 00:19:59,600
[MERO]
Are you alright?
I was so worried!

446
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,633
[MIIA]
(huh?)

447
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,066
Oh no, this is terrible!

448
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,666
You're freezing cold now!

449
00:20:03,766 --> 00:20:05,900
Please allow me to warm you up
with my own body heat!

450
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,266
[MIIA]
(confused)

451
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:08,633
[KIMIHITO]
She'll be okay, Mero...

452
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:10,933
And Miia, the bath
is still warm;

453
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:12,866
you should probably go take one.

454
00:20:12,966 --> 00:20:13,933
[KIMIHITO]
(startled)

455
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:14,966
[MIIA]
It's Suu.

456
00:20:15,066 --> 00:20:16,400
[KIMIHITO]
I can see that!

457
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,933
[MERO]
The heater must have dried her
out as well,

458
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:21,000
so she's trying
to replenish her water.

459
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,333
[MERO]
That's why she tried to
attack me earlier.

460
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,166
[KIMIHITO]
(struggling)

461
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,666
Oh, so that's what happened!

462
00:20:28,766 --> 00:20:30,500
[KIMIHITO]
If you're not gonna help,
go take a bath!

463
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,700
[MERO]
Great idea. Would you mind too
much if I joined you?

464
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:38,733
[MERO]
It's so nice and warm...

465
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,266
I hear it's quite common
in Japan

466
00:20:40,366 --> 00:20:42,633
to have heart‐to‐hearts
while in the bath.

467
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:43,666
[MIIA]
Mero?

468
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:44,600
[MERO]
(hm?)

469
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,166
I'm uh... sorry...

470
00:20:46,266 --> 00:20:48,900
I shouldn't have been so rude
to you.

471
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,466
[MERO]
When were you rude?

472
00:20:50,566 --> 00:20:52,800
[MIIA]
You didn't notice?!

473
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,000
It's just that you and my
Darling get along so well...

474
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,066
I guess I got jealous...
so I'm sorry.

475
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:03,433
[MIIA]
But!

476
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:06,533
I'm still not giving up
on becoming Darling's bride!

477
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:07,800
I never will!

478
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,433
[MERO]
Your enthusiasm is inspiring,

479
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:11,833
but I have no intention
of marrying the master.

480
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:13,133
[MIIA]
(huh?)

481
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:14,766
I already told you, didn't I?

482
00:21:14,866 --> 00:21:17,766
There's nothing I love more than
stories like The Little Mermaid!

483
00:21:17,866 --> 00:21:19,000
[MIIA]
You mean...?

484
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,233
Yes... You need not worry...

485
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,833
What I want most of all is...

486
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:26,800
[MERO]
...tragic love!

487
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,300
I guarantee you I'll never
get in the way of your romance!

488
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,333
In fact, I'll be praying with
all my heart that the master
takes your hand in marriage!

489
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:37,000
[MERO]
All I want is to experience
a profound and dramatic love
that will never be returned!

490
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:41,166
[MERO]
I'm more than happy to support
all of you in your quest
for the master's heart!

491
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,733
However, for the sake of
authenticity,

492
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,566
I do ask that you overlook
a little infidelity on his part!

493
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,166
That won't be
a problem, will it?

494
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:49,166
[MIIA]
Infidelity?! I don't think so!

495
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,433
Darling is mine and mine alone!

496
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:51,966
We'd better not
underestimate her.

497
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:53,600
[MERO]
Well, of course, his HEART will
be!

498
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,166
That's the beauty
of unrequited love!

499
00:21:55,266 --> 00:21:56,333
Sounds like
they're getting along.

500
00:21:56,433 --> 00:21:58,066
[MIIA]
That doesn't make sense!

501
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:33,066
[MIIA]
I can't marry you
if I can't live up to your
expectations as your bride!

502
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,633
[MIIA]
After you finally said
you'd consider marriage!

503
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:40,333
[MIIA]
I've never messed up molting!
What's wrong with me?!

504
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:43,366
[PAPI]
I'm gonna lay an egg.
