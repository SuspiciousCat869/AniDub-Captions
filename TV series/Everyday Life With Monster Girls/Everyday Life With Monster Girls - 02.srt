happened again

00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:05,559
[KIMIHITO]
Hope she's okay.

158
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,661
[PAPI]
I know! I can save her!

159
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,162
I'll peck her 'til she lets go!

160
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,496
[KIMIHITO]
No don't do that!

161
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:20,741
[PAPI]
Oh yeah, I guess, my wings are
too wet to fly.

162
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,042
[KIMIHITO/MIIA]
(groan)

163
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,244
[MIIA]
Don't worry, I'll save her
myself!

164
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,813
Lamias are excellent climbers,
after all!

165
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,453
[KIMIHITO]
Miia...

166
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,691
[MIIA]
Yes! This is a perfect
opportunity!

167
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,961
I'll save that little girl and
impress my Darling!

168
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,062
(small exert)

169
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:44,631
[MIIA]
There's so many leaves...

170
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,299
I hope I can find her
in all this...

171
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,269
[MIIA]
Oww, stupid branch!

172
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:50,804
This is harder than I thought...

173
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:53,707
[LITTLE GIRL]
(scared) Mommy...

174

[MIIA (Creepy)]
That's... it...

175
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,444
come... here...

176
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,914
[LITTLE GIRL]

177
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,315

181
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:11,658

Agh, my wings!

[PAPI]
(gasp)

186
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,935
[KIMIHITO]
Ugh... that... hurt...

187
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,805
[PAPI]
(surprised) You just saved me!

188
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,908
[KIMIHITO]
Uh‐huh... and you saved her...

189
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:28,609
Good job...

190
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,844
[PAPI]
Um... (happy)

191
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:33,113
[LITTLE GIRL 2A]
Thanks, Birdie!

192
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:37,050
[PAPI]
(embarrassed chuckle)

193
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,587
Hey wait... I tried to save the
day too, you know...

194
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:44,424
[KIMIHITO]
It's okay... I know you did.
(surprised)

195
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:47,594
[SATSUKE]
Huh? I heard there was a little
girl stuck in a tree here.

196
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:48,862
[MIIA]
Nope!

197
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,697
Well, there was, but thanks to
this one,

198
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:51,732
she's safe and sound.

199
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:52,899
[SATSUKE]
Oh, is that right?

200
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,500
Thanks so much for your help!

201
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,269
[PAPI]
(happy) Uh‐huh!

202
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,840
[SATSUKE]
By the way... You're demi‐human
exchange students, right?

203
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,442
Where's your host family?

204
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:03,810
[MIIA]
Well, I have Darling, but...

205
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,346
[PAPI]
Is this the part where I get
incested?

206
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,114
[KIMIHITO]
Papi keep your voice down!

207
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,651
It's more about you getting
kicked out of the country!

208
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:13,219
[PAPI]
Noooo!

209
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,454
[SATSUKE]
I'm waiting...

(nervous)

211
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,524

(look)

212
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:18,692
(determined)

213
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,394
[KIMIHITO]
I'm her host family, sir.

214
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,629
[MIIA/PAPI]
(surprised)

215
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,731
[KIMIHITO]
They both live at my house.

216
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,332
[MIIA]
Oh, darling...

217
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,369
[SATSUKE]
Then would you mind showing me
your IDs, please?

218
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,236
[MIIA]
(huh?)

219
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,038
[ALL]
Uh‐oh!

220
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,075
[SATSUKE]
Well...?

221
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,210
[KIMIHITO]
(nervous)

222
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,279
[SATSUKE]
(annoyed)

223
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,349
[KIMIHITO]
(nervous)

224
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,952
[SATSUKE]
I'll ask you one more time,
can I please see your‐

225
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,922
[SMITH]
Officer... Is this what you're
looking for?

226
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,858
[KIMIHITO]
Where did you come from?!

227
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,128
[KIMIHITO]
Okay Ms. Smith,
that was kinda outta nowhere.

228
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:58,131
How did you get her ID at the
drop of a hat like that?

229
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,499
[SMITH]
(sip) Hm?

230
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,168
Oh, that old thing?
I already had it.

231
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,270
[KIMIHITO]
What? You did?

232
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,874
[SMITH]
I've had trouble finding someone
to host a repeat run‐a‐way.

233
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,611
[SMITH]
I had it on me because I was
about to force...

234
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:14,280
Ahem... I mean ASK you
to let her live here.

235
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,816
[SMITH]
But she got away.

236
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:19,452
So the coordinator Papi ran away
from was actually YOU?!

237
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:20,453
[KIMIHITO]
(realize)

238
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:21,755
Wait... that's not good...

239
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,524
[SMITH]
Well then, back to business...

240
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,358
I hope you like your new
home, Papi.

241
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,860
[PAPI] Really?!
[MIIA] What?!

242
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,563
Be sure to listen to everything
this man tells you...

243
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:31,665
He's the master of the
household.

244
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:32,866
[PAPI]
Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay!

245
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,100
[KIMIHITO]
Uh‐are you sure it's okay

246
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,236
to have two of them in
the same house?!

247
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,838
[SMITH]
Eh, why not?

248
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:40,040
[KIMIHITO]
Again, you are WAY too careless
about your job!

249
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,677
[SMITH]
Now, Papi, promise me you'll
never run away again.

250
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,045
[PAPI]
I promise!

251
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,814
I may not be very smart, but I
know one thing!

252
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,049
And I won't forget it!

253
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,717
[KIMIHITO (Under)]
(surprised)

254
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,687
[PAPI]
I'll stay reeeeal close
to my Master's side

255
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:55,155
from now on... okay?

256
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,489
Take good care of me!

257
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,325
[PAPI]
Oh and Master, we never finished
our bath earlier.

258
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,962
Let's go take one right now!
Come on, come on!

259
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,363
[KIMIHITO]
(pulled)
Hey, don't pull me!

260
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:04,731
[KIMIHITO]
I uh...

261
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,167
[MIIA]
That's a great idea...

262
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:10,403
Go right ahead... You and Papi
have a nice bath.

263
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,738
[PAPI]
Hee hee, let's go!

264
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:12,873
[KIMIHITO]
Uh... mmhmm.

265
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,207
[MIIA]
Don't let her catch cold!

266
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,309
[SMITH]
I've got to hand it to you,
Miia.

267
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,744
You're surprisingly calm.

268
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,980
I thought you'd be furious.

269
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,482
[MIIA]
Oh no, it's nothing
to be upset about.

270
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:27,688
[MIIA]
I was annoyed a nuisance like
her is invading the happy home
I share with Darling, buuut...

271
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,055
I'll be okay!

272
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,526
I mean, Papi's a kid...
a child... a baby, even!

273
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:36,863
Adults don't get jealous over
silly little stuff like that!
That's pathetic!

274
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,700
[SMITH]
Well... actually Papi's
the same age as you.

275
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,167
[MIIA]
(shock)

276
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,737
[SMITH]
You see, the harpies evolved
smaller bodies

277
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,739
to make
themselves more aerodynamic...

278
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,909
so they often look
younger than they are.

279
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,077
[KIMIHITO]
(scream)

280
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,579
[MIIA]
On second thought, Darling,

281
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,947
let ME keep her company!

282
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,919
[MIIA]
Listen, Darling is mine and mine
alone.

283
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,087
So keep your grubby little
fingers off of him!

284
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,825
[PAPI]
Uh yeah okay... but I don't have
any fingers... I'm a bird.

285
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,392
[MIIA]
Oh, you know what I mean!

286
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,328
If you touch him with any of
your body parts, you're dead!

287
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:11,364
[KIMIHITO]
I think two of them
might be too many...

288
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,201
[PAPI]
MonMusu!

289
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,444
[CEREA]
MonMusu!

290
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:30,316
[PAPI]
(nervous trembling)

291
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,185

(soft breathing)

292
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,090
[KIMIHITO]
(smile)

293
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:41,194
[KIMIHITO]
(sigh)

294
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:48,468
[KIMIHITO]
Never thought I'd have to make a
grocery run

295
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:50,103
first thing in the morning.

296
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:53,840
It's so hard to keep the fridge
stocked these days.

297
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,308
[KIMIHITO]
(sigh)

298
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:58,311
[KIMIHITO]
I hope my poor wallet can handle
it...

299
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,114
(stampeding hooves)

300
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,283
[KIMIHITO]
(smacked)
(scream)

301
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:11,658
[CEREA]
How fortuitous that I should
finally meet you...

302
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,326
Must be fate I guess!

303
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,729
[CEREA]
I am known as Centorea
Shianus...

304
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:17,898
a member of the proud
Centaur race...

305
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:21,635
Could you be the man who's
destined to be my master?

306
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:25,005
[KIMIHITO]
(weak stammering)

307
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,908
[SMITH]
Oh, Centorea?

308
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:31,845
[SMITH]
She has special permission
to be out by herself.

309
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,547
From what I understand...

310
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:37,918
Centaurs have a tradition of
seeking out their own masters to
serve.

311
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,419
[KIMIHITO]
(on phone) Masters?

312
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,555
[SMITH]
I'm sure she's referring to host
families...

313
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,390
I mean uh... if she really
wants to live in Japan,

314
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,128
she'll need to find one pretty
soon, so... (yawn)

315
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:50,531
[KIMIHITO]
Uh, Ms. Smith?

316
00:13:50,631 --> 00:13:54,300
[SMITH]
Sorry... but I don't deal with
this stuff on my day off...

317
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,970
You'll have to look after her
yourself, okay?

318
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,071
[KIMIHITO]
What?!

319
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,606
[SMITH]
Night, Darling.

320
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:01,141
[KIMIHITO]
Wait! Ms. Smith‐!

321
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:04,044
Oh great... That figures.

322
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:07,614
[CEREA]
Impressive... These Japanese
spells truly are powerful!

323
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:09,015
[KIMIHITO]
Spells?

324
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:10,817
[CEREA]
Legend has it that if you run
straight

325
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,686
into an intersection
with all your might,

326
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:14,487
you are sure to encounter your
soulmate.

327
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:16,056
It is an ancient
prophecy!

328
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:17,423
[KIMIHITO]
I don't know where you're
getting all this,

329
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,859
but it sounds
more like a traffic accident!

330
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,393
You could've killed me!

331
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:21,762
[CEREA]
Oh... I...I see.

332
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,129
[KIMIHITO]
Seriously...

333
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,265
What makes you think I
would be your soulmate?

334
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,667
And besides...

335
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:29,235
that stuff only happens in
anime... It's not real life.

336
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,037
[CEREA]
(surprised)
Is that so.

337
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,239
Perhaps I should have tried it
with some toast in my mouth.

338
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,975
[GIRL (Mouth Full)]
Oh no, I'm late!

339
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:37,544
[KIMIHITO]
Where did you learn all these
tropes from?!

340
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:39,513
And why are you in such a hurry
to find your soulmate?

341
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:42,082
You don't have to resort
to violence, you know!

342
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:44,050
[CEREA]
I will do whatever it takes.

343
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,951
(approaching moped)

344
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:45,786
[LADY]
(scream)

345
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:46,553
[ROBBER]
(grab)

346
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:47,654
(surprised)

347
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,890
[ROBBER]
Watch it! Outta my way!

348
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,824
[CEREA]
(grab)

349
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:52,258
[KIMIHITO]
(grabbed)

350
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,294
That ruffian should learn to
look where he's going!

351
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,162
[KIMIHITO]
(muffled struggling)
Can't breathe...

352
00:14:56,262 --> 00:15:00,066
[KIMIHITO]
(muffled struggling)
(gasp for air)

353
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,135
[CEREA]
(startled)
Excuse me!

354
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,004
[KIMIHITO]
(panting)

355
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:07,107
That must've been the guy
who's been snatching purses
around here lately!

356
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,108
[CEREA]
(surprised) What?!

357
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,676
On my honor as a Centaur,

358
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,712
I cannot abide this thievery!

359
00:15:11,812 --> 00:15:13,146
[CEREA]
I swear by my blade,

360
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:17,017
this pilfering lowlife will be
brought to justice!

361
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,285
Sadly, the law forbids me
to do so alone...

362
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,421
I am unable to harm your kind...

363
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:25,926
So I've searched far and wide
for a valiant master
to fight by my side.

364
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,795
[KIMIHITO]
Isn't there a law against
swords, too?

365
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:29,763
(surprised)

366
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,197
But there's not much time.

367
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,734
Whether or not you're my master
makes no difference.

368
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:35,068
[CEREA]
You must come with me!

369
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:37,804
[KIMIHITO]
Okay, okay! I get it!

370
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:38,939
I guess I'll just hop on...

371
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:39,940
[CEREA]
(startled)

372
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:43,243
[KIMIHITO]
(startled) Hey!

373
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,812
[CEREA]
What are you doing?! I am not a
horse!

374
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:49,616
[CEREA]
And if you're not my master,
then you must restrain yourself!

375
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:53,253
[CEREA]
How dare you? That's the last
time I rely on some worthless
Japanese spell.

376
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:56,456
[KIMIHITO]
Well if I can't ride you, then
how are we gonna catch him?!

377
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,962
[ROBBER]
(whistle) Heh heh...

378
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,598
[ROBBER]
Now this is what I call a good
haul!

379
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:06,166
[CEREA]
Stop right there!

380
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:09,570
I encourage you to surrender
this instant and come quietly,

381
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,004
you insolent scoundrel!

382
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:13,373
Otherwise, you will be forced to
repent for your sins

383
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,241
at the edge of
my glistening blade!

384
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:18,512
[CEREA]
And if you try something
indecent, I'll throw you off!

385
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:20,714
[KIMIHITO]
Okay, then please slow down!

386
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,549
[ROBBER]
Is that a centaur?

387
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,917
(laugh)

388
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,019
Luckily I've got more horsepower
than you, babe!

389
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:27,387
[CEREA]
Not so fast!

390
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,090
[KIMIHITO]
Where's the brakes on this
thing?!

391
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,829
[ROBBER]
(laugh)

392
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,430
[KIMIHITO]
Slow down, I'm falling off!

393
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:39,733
[CEREA]
Then stop floundering around!

394
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:44,237
[ROBBER]

(flailing) (scream)

397
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:53,313
[CEREA]
Is that the best you can do?

398
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:54,615
[KIMIHITO (Under)]
(panic)

399

402
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:07,060
[ROBBER]
(laugh) Later, jackass!

403
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,229
[CEREA]
Oh yeah?! I won't lose that
easily...

404
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,632
[KIMIHITO]
Are you gonna‐?!

405
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:13,734
[KIMIHITO]

[ROBBER]
What the‐?!

411
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,516
[CEREA]
There's no escape!

412
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:32,619
Alright then, if you could do
the honors on my behalf...
(panic)

413
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,755
[KIMIHITO]
Agh... I think I'm gonna die!

414
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:35,589
[CEREA]
(shriek)

415

[ROBBER]
(gasp)

416
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,260
[CEREA]
Just what do you think you're
doing to me?!

417
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,095
[KIMIHITO]
Wait, stop, if you keep
struggling like that‐!

418
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,463

[CEREA]
I see... This was your plan.

421
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,869
[KIMIHITO]
Hey, slow down!

422
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:50,403
[CEREA]
Bastard!

423
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:52,338
It's one thing
for you to ride me,

424
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,407
but now you're groping me
as well?!

425
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:56,677
[CEREA]
You will not get away with this!

[KIMIHITO]
Ouch. Hey, wait!

430
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,193
Look up! Watch where you're
going!

How dare you disrespect me like
this?

434
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,872
I cannot believe you.

435

00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,679
[CEREA]
(react) Wait a second,
what am I doing?

438
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:37,083
[CEREA]
Damn that crook!
He still must be punished!

439
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,384
[CEREA]
(gasp)

440
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,520
(anger)

441
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,060
[ROBBER]
Alright, now I'm freakin' mad.

442
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,529
I'll slice you to shreds!

443
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:49,195

[KIMIHITO]
(shock)

447
00:18:56,036 --> 00:19:01,241
This is it... I'm... gonna...
die...

448
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:08,582
[KIMIHITO]
Nope... As it turns out,
I'm still alive and well.

449
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:09,482
(chuckle) Yeah.

450
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,552
[KIMIHITO]
Her sword's a replica.

451
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:15,021
[SMITH (phone)]
Well, it's not like she could
walk around with a real one.

452
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:18,559
[SMITH]
I can't believe you were stupid
enough to go after him.

453
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:21,027
[KIMIHITO (phone)]
She didn't really give me a
choice in the matter.

454
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:23,564
I mean, the guy was on
a moped, so‐

455
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:24,565
[SMITH]
Moped?

456
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:26,700
(phone)
Oh God, please don't tell me

457
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,368
you rode on her back.

458
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,537
[SMITH]
There's a commandment in Centaur
literature...

459
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:34,340
She can only be ridden
by the one she chooses to be
her lifelong master.

460
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,209
[KIMIHITO]
(shock)

461
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,512
[SMITH (phone)]
From their perspective, it's the
same as getting married...

462
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:42,315
So if you FORCEFULLY rode on her
back, well, that would be...

463
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:45,385
[KIMIHITO]
Would... be what...?

464
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:46,853
[SMITH (phone)]
Well... "violating her".

465
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:48,622
[KIMIHITO] I didn't do that
I did no such thing!

466
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:49,923
[SMITH] Ah! Dinner!

467
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,866
[KIMIHITO]
I AM SERIOUSLY SO SORRY ABOUT
THAT, CENTOREA!

468
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:02,603
[KIMIHITO]
I had no idea riding you was
such a sacred thing!

469
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,905
I really didn't mean
any harm, I swear!

470
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:06,372
(silence)

471
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:09,042
[KIMIHITO]
Uh, Centorea?

472
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:10,210
(surprised)

473
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:12,613
[CEREA]
Please don't call me that...

474
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:15,649
If you wouldn't mind,
I'd rather you call me Cerea.

475
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:18,919
[CEREA]
My family and closest friends
call me by that name.

476
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:20,320
[KIMIHITO]
(huh?)

477
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,623
Besides, what happened today
was all my fault...

478
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:26,492
My selfish sense of justice
has caused you a great deal of
trouble.

479
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,529
[CEREA]
And you were injured...

480
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:31,998
Well yeah... but I could've put
a stop to it if I'd wanted to...

481
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:34,267
You don't have to go out of your
way to be nice to me‐

482
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:35,569
[CEREA]
That's not the point!

483
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:38,505
Can you feel my heart beating?
It's racing!

484
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:42,175
I can sense my destiny
taking shape!

485
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,778
This is like the fateful
encounter between

486
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:47,981
the Greek Hero
Heracles and his mentor Chiron!

487
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,182
[HERACLES]
(manly grunt)

488
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:51,017
Perhaps there's something to be
said

489
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:52,285
for Japanese spells...

490
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,287
I did find you after all.

491
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,256
[CEREA]
You... the master
I've searched for.

492
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,390
[KIMIHITO]
(surprised)

493
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,892
[CEREA]
That was the first time

494
00:20:58,992 --> 00:20:59,926
since I've been here...

495
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:01,528
no, the first time EVER,

496
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:05,632
that someone has been willing to
risk his life to protect me.

497
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,435
[CEREA]
And therefore... this day...

498
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:11,071
I, Centorea Shianus...

499
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:13,306
[CEREA]
... name you my chosen master...

500
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:15,475
and swear my eternal
fealty unto you.

501
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:16,442
[KIMIHITO]
(surprised)

502
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:17,878
[CEREA]
Well, Master?

503
00:21:17,978 --> 00:21:19,513
W‐would you please...

504
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:22,348
accept my undying loyalty?

505
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,384
Ah... Cerea...

506
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:25,986
[MIIA]
(angry)

507
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:28,722
How many girlfriends do you plan
on bringing home, Darling?!

508
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:30,524
[PAPI]
Yeah, and what's for dinner?!

509
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,358
[CEREA]
(offended) What did she say?!

510
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,060
Who are these girls, Master?

511
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,495
This is quite improper!

512
00:21:35,596 --> 00:21:38,264
[MIIA]
(worried) What happened?
You're hurt!

513
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:39,499
[PAPI]
Hungry Hungry!

514
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,434
[KIMIHITO]
(panic)

515
00:21:41,535 --> 00:21:44,170
[CEREA]
Ladies! Now that I'm living here
with you all...

516
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,472
I must insist we make a few
adjustments!

517
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:49,009
[CEREA]
My Master is my first priority,
do you understand?

518
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:52,412
[MIIA]
S'cuse me, Darling is MY
priority not yours! Ugh!

519
00:21:52,513 --> 00:21:55,215
[PAPI]
(mouth full) Yeah, me too!

520
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:59,319
[KIMIHITO]
And yet nobody wants to help me
with the chores...

521
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:30,911
[MIIA]
Got you!

522
00:23:31,011 --> 00:23:32,746
[MIIA]
I'll never let you go, Darling!

523
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:35,849
[MIIA]
We're going to get married and
live happily ever after!

524
00:23:35,949 --> 00:23:38,151
[PAPI]
Don't think so! Master's gonna
marry ME!

525
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:41,254
[CEREA]
No, the only proper wife
for my Master is ME!

526
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:42,756
[MIIA/PAPI/CEREA]
(glare)

527
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:44,925
[MIIA] Darling!
[CEREA/PAPI] Master!
