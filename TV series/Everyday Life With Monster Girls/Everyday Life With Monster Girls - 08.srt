[KIMIHITO]
(sleepy breathing)(groan)

2
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:45,238
[KIMIHITO]
(confused groan)(look)

3
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:49,610
[CEREA]
Good morning to you... Master.

4
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,648
[KIMIHITO]
(freak out)Whoa!.. What are you
doing here?!

5
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:57,784
[KIMIHITO]
Miia would do this... but you...

6
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,954
[PAPI]
That was yummy!

7
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,255
[SUU]
Mhm!

8
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,758
[RACHNELA]
Breakfast was wonderful.. Honey.

9
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,259
[KIMIHITO]
Glad you enjoyed it.

10
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,461
[MIIA]
Wait a minute, bug breath!...

11
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:11,297
I heard that!...
What the heck do you
think you're doing by

12
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,066
calling my future husband
Honey?!

13
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,901
[RACHNELA]
Oh... Would you rather I call

14
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,069
him "Darling" the way you do?

15
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,705
[MIIA]
(angry)(raging)

16
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,909
[MIIA]
You better watch it!... you
skanky spiderrrr!

17
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:27,347
[RACHNELA]
Oh no, dear, you can call me
Rachnera...

18
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,149
We're all friends
here, aren't we?

19
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,317
[MIIA]
(grunt)Get her, Papi‐

20
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:34,721
[PAPI]
Wow, you're so fun!‐ I want you
to be my big sister!

21
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,590
[RACHNELA]
There's the greeting I was
hoping for.

22
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,260
[MIIA]
Thanks a lot, Papi, you're a big
help!

23
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,828
[MERO]
Tell me, which ocean did you
come from?

24
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:46,099
[RACHNELA]
(laugh)Well, I'm a spider, not a
crab.

25
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,571
[MIIA]
Whatever, who needs them?
Centorea should take my side!

26
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,138
[MIIA]
(stunned)

27
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,540
[CEREA]
I don't have any objections to

28
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,509
Lady Rachnela staying here with
us.

29
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:56,543
[MIIA]
Huh?!

30
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,278
[CEREA]
She doesn't make me suspicious

31
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,213
the way Lady Meroune does.

32
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,857
[KIMIHITO]
Hey... Cerea!(ahhh...)

33
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,492
[CEREA]
(surprised)Pardon me!

34
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:15,095
Please ride on my back!... Go
on!

35
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,763
[KIMIHITO]
No thanks, it's okay...

36
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,332
Something wrong?... You're being
kinda pushy.

37
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:20,967
Why are you sticking so close to
me?

38
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,804
[CEREA]
What do you mean?... You're my
great master!...

39
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:28,208
It's my duty to
accompany you... Please allow me
to stay at your side always!

40
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,443
[KIMIHITO]
It's just... I gotta pee so...

41
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,979
[CEREA]
P‐please excuse me then!

42
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:39,753
[MIIA]
So you really don't mind her?

43
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,789
[CEREA] I don't.
[MIIA] That spider's gotta be up
to no good,

44
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,491
don't you think?... I
mean, she even LOOKS dangerous.

45
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,260
[CEREA] Miia.
[MIIA] (surprised)

46
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,295
[CEREA]
No matter how she looks...

47
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:54,134
don't judge
someone by appearance,
It's not honorable.

48
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,401
[CEREA]
As non‐human species,

49
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:56,803
we should
know that better than anyone.

50
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,305
[MIIA]
Y... yeah, I know that but
still‐

51
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,373
[CEREA]
(grunt)

52
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,142
[MIIA/CEREA] (startled)(look)

53
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,577
[CEREA]
(kick)

54
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:06,179
[CEREA/ MIIA]
(fuming) (angry)

55
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,581
[RACHNELA]
(clear throat)

56
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,450
[RACHNELA]
Whoops.. Sorry!... Silly Honey

57
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:15,155
just came rushing into the
bathroom!... I was so startled I
trapped him!(giggle)

58
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,422
[MIIA]
That's a lie!... You were

59
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:17,624
waiting for Darling
to‐(surprised)

60
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,425
[CEREA]
That's alright... But if you

61
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:22,428
wouldn't mind... please lock the
door from now on.

62
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:23,664
[MIIA]
(shocked)

63
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:28,101
[KIMIHITO]
(sigh)I'm so tired...

64
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:32,338
What's up with Cerea today? And
Rachne...

65
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,741
(startled)What the hell?!

66
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,476
[RACHNELA]
I see we're finally alone.

67
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:38,912
[KIMIHITO]
Rachne!

68
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,347
[RACHNELA]
Oh and you've shortened my name
too?

69
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,284
I quite like it.

70
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,919
[KIMIHITO]
What are you doing in my
bedroom?!

71
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,890
[RACHNELA]
I'm here to make you mine.
Head.. to.. toe.

72
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,391
[KIMIHITO]
(panic)

73
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:55,729
[RACHNELA]
You're looking for a marriage
partner, right, Honey?

74
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:59,065
And yet you haven't laid a
finger on them.

75
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,234
Are you
lacking experience?

76
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,603
[KIMIHITO]
(freak out)

77
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,204
[RACHNELA]
In that case, I'll teach you

78
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,908
everything you need to know,
Honey.(giggle)

79
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:12,312
I'm promise it'll be fun...
Those other girls won't get in
our way.

80
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:16,449
Ooh! You're already so hard!

81
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,855
[RACHNELA]
(surprised)Oh my... Was that
really necessary?

82
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,124
[KIMIHITO]
I thought that was a fake sword.

83
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:25,025
[CEREA]
(determined)

84
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,693
[KIMIHITO]
(scream)

85
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:32,599
[RACHNELA]
How about that...She might be
more deadly than me.

86
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,169
[KIMIHITO]
Cerea, stop running!

87
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,104
I'll fall off!... Where are you
taking me?

88
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,973
[CEREA]
Somewhere you'll be safe!

89
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:43,443
If she means to sink her fangs
into my Master, then...

90
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:46,747
then...
we'll just have to run away!

91
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,351
[CEREA] Have a nice day!
[KIMIHITO] You too hun!

92
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,922
[CEREA] It's kicking!
[KIMIHITO] Let me feel!

93
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,491
[CEREA]
(troubled)They're staring.

94
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:00,026
[KIMIHITO]
(huh?)

95
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,963
[CEREA]
Those are the stares we
non‐humans always get.

96
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,198
I'm sure
most of them don't mean any
harm.

97
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:09,670
Still... the stares people give
you just because you're
different...

98
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,773
They're so severe... they pierce
through you.

99
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:16,042
[KIMIHITO]
I think they're probably staring
at something else...

100
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:19,145
[CEREA]
Those looks are painful... We
know that all too well.

101
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,581
SATSUKE
(ogling)

102
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:23,149
[KIMIHITO]
I still don't think that's the
reason‐

103
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:27,521
[CEREA]
I hate the way it makes me
feel... and yet...

104
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:29,489
I'm no better...

105
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,025
I judged Lady
Rachnela by her appearance.

106
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,161
[KIMIHITO]
Well... you turned out to be
right...

107
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,697
[CEREA]
That's not the point! Making

108
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:39,132
assumptions about her was still
unforgivable!

109
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,670
I'm ashamed... I came here to be
an ambassador

110
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,841
of the proud
Centaur species, and yet... look
at me.

111
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,647
I can't represent my kind... I'm
not worthy.

112
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,181
[KIMIHITO]
(concerned)

113
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,050
[RACIST GUY]
Well, well, well!

114
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,952
Check out that massive rack!...

115
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:01,888
But that horse's ass... that's
freakin' gross.

116
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:05,258
[RACIST GIRL]
Isn't that a Centaur?... Can you
even screw one of those things?

117
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:09,029
[KIMIHITO]
Not these jerks again... They
even brought friends.

118
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,798
[CEREA] (hmph!)
[RACIST GUY] She's more like a
cow with those tits!

119
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,701
[RACIST GIRL]
No kidding! I wanna milk 'em!

120
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,070
[RACIST GUY]
Yeah, that sounds good. I'll do
that!

121
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,572
[KIMIHITO]
Hey, that's enough‐

122
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,974
[CEREA]
Wait, Master... I don't
understand anything

123
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,143
they're
saying, but this isn't worth it.

124
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:24,611
We should get out of here‐

125
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,880
[RACIST GIRL]
Is that her boyfriend?

126
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,116
[RACIST GUY]
There's no way a wussy boy like
him can keep her satisfied!

127
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,319
[THUG 8A]
Yeah, I bet he's a virgin with a
little baby wiener!

128
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,855
[RACIST GIRL]
Ha, she needs a stallion!

129
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:39,125
[CEREA]
(screams)I'll cut you to
pieces!... Now begone!

130
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,861
[KIMIHITO]
Whoa... Cerea!

131
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,129
[RACIST GUY]
Uh‐oh... Be careful...

132
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:46,266
You monsters aren't
allowed to attack people,
remember?

133
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:50,837
[CEREA] (unsure)
[RACIST GUY] You don't wanna get
deported, now do you?

134
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,906
[THUG 8A]
Where you goin', virgin boy?

135
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,976
[CEREA] Master, no!
[THUG 8B/THUG 8C]
(reach out)

136
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,913
[RACIST GUY]
We can forget about the bottom
half anyway.

137
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:03,116
Those titties'll be
enough for all of us.

138
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:07,387
[RACIST GUY]
(laughter)(huh?)

139
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,490
[RACIST GUY]
What the hell...

140
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:11,892
[RACHNELA]
Well what do we have here?

141
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,828
[RACIST GUY]
(surprised)(look)

142
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,263
[RACHNELA]
have you been playing naughty
games without me?

143
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,866
[RACIST GUY MenTHUG 8A/THUG
8B/THUG 8CRACIST GIRL]
(panicking)

144
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,468
[RACIST GUY]
You know the law; you're not
allowed to hurt me!

145
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,871
I‐if I go
to the authorities, you...!

146
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:29,409
[RACHNELA]
Do you really think you're going
to get that chance, my friend?

147
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,277
[RACIST GUY]
(faint)

148
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,848
[RACHNELA]
(sigh)Honestly... Why were you
letting that

149
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,117
sniveling gaggle of
vermin have their way with you?

150
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:40,486
[CEREA]
I had to... causing harm to
humans is illegal.

151
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:43,289
[RACHNELA]
Only if you get caught.

152
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:46,459
[CEREA]
(clear throat)Well.. anyway,
thank you for that.

153
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,928
If not for you, Master and I
would‐

154
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,830
[RACHNELA]
Only I can torment you...

155
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,734
On.. ly.. me!... Understand,
Honey?

156
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:57,037
[RACHNELA] Now let's get a nice
room somewhere, shall we?

157
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,873
[RACHNELA]
(pained)

158
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,776
[RACHNELA]
Ouch... That wasn't funny,

159
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,612
dear... You could've killed me
with those hard hooves!

160
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,816
[CEREA]
I‐I am grateful to you, and I
don't mean to discriminate...

161
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,485
[CEREA]
... but even so, I still hate
you!

162
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:13,687
[KIMIHITO/RACHNELA]
(huh?)

163
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,455
[CEREA]
You mustn't toy with him!...

164
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,323
He's not some plaything; he's my
Master!

165
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:20,561
And as his servant, I can't
watch him endure this!(squeeze)

166
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,729
[KIMIHITO]
(squeezed)(long weak)

167
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,865
[CEREA]
(gasp)Ah.. what have I done
now?!

168
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,500
And after she rescued me too...

169
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:31,271
I should
return to my homeland. Thank you
for everything, Master...

170
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,739
[KIMIHITO]
Whoa, calm down!

171
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,307
[RACHNELA] (laughter)
[KIMIHITO/CEREA] (huh?)

172
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,977
[RACHNELA]
I see you're finally speaking
your mind...

173
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,947
You're much too
serious... you know that?

174
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,917
It bothers me when people try to
put up a good front.

175
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,286
Like the way
you said you had no objections

176
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:49,255
even though you were
afraid of me. Just be honest!

177
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:54,294
I know, I'm a giant spider. I'm
dangerous enough to do THIS.

178
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:57,564
It's natural to be wary, but is
it discriminating?

179
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,300
You can like and dislike what
you want...

180
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,571
If you find you
dislike me... well, that's
normal.

181
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,608
Pretending to get along just
makes you a hypocrite.

182
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,611
It's
alright for you not to like
me.(smile)

183
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,112
[CEREA]
(surprised)

184
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:15,448
[RACHNELA]
Now then... why don't we head
back home?

185
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:17,884
Spinning all that
thread made me hungry.

186
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:21,822
[KIMIHITO]
Oh...okay, I'll make something
for dinner.

187
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:25,091
[CEREA]
Goodness...I didn't know what
to say.

188
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,894
It may be true that I dislike
her, but...

189
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,830
[KIMIHITO]
You're gonna
make me fall down.

190
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:33,767
[CEREA]But perhaps I can
at least trust her.

191
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:37,003
[RACHNELA](Under)
You're so warm, Honey...(giggle)

192
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:41,174
[CEREA]
Lady Rachnela, please allow me
to repay you for saving me.

193
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,844
I feel just
terrible for my ingratitude.

194
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:46,179
[RACHNELA]
Hmm... In that case...

195
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,816
[MIIA]
(amazed)

196
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,652
[KIMIHITO]
Um... what's happening?

197
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:56,590
[RACHNELA]
Oh... I just wanted to try tying
her up... Nice, isn't it?

198
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,994
[CEREA]
Endure it, Centorea, you deserve
this!

199
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,697
Perhaps this punishment
will cleanse your impure heart!

200
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,732
[RACHNELA]
Oooh!... Wouldn't it be fun if I

201
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,233
tied your hands behind your
back?(giggle)

202
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,336
[CEREA]
I really do hate
her!(struggling)

203
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,807
[RACHNELA]
MonMusu!

204
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:23,850
[KIMIHITO/SUU]
MonMusu.

205
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,421
[MIIA]
Oh no! You caught a cold?!

206
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,924
[KIMIHITO]
Uh‐huh...(cough)

207
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,761
[KIMIHITO] Ugh...
[MIIA] No... Please don't die on
me, Darling!

208
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,597
[PAPI]
Wow, Master... You look bad.

209
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:39,933
[MIIA]
Don't you worry!... You can
just leave everything to Nurse

210
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,903
Lamia, okay?‐ I'll have you back
to perfect health in no time!

211
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:45,906
Oh my gosh, Darling, you're
getting really sweaty!

212
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,908
Maybe we'd better take all your
clothes off!...

213
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,743
Or maybe you
want to give ME a shot.‐

214
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,011
What do you
think of that?(thirsty laughter)

215
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,813
[CEREA]
Miia!... Get a hold of yourself!

A] (startled)

217
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:59,019
[SMITH]
Stop right there! Ladies... you
must evacuate quickly!

218
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:04,390
Darling may be contaminated. We
have to quarantine him.

219
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,561
We're responding to a severe
threat of virus mutation.

220
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:13,499
If a new virus from a human
mutates and is transmitted to
non‐human species...

221
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,270
It could lead to a
pandemic that threatens the
existence of all non‐humans!

222
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,340
[CEREA]
So, what do you propose we do
about Master?

223
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,578
[SMITH]
Don't worry... You ladies let me
take care of him instead.

224
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:26,012
[MIIA]
Aren't you busy?

225
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,414
[SMITH]
Well yes... I've got more
paperwork

226
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:32,519
than I can manage...
but preventing your extinction
is first priority!

227
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:36,189
[ZOMBINA]
You're the worst!... Don't bail
out when we're busy!

228
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,759
[RACHNELA/MIIA/CEREA]
She just wants to skip out of
work!

229
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,728
[SMITH]
(snoring)

230
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:42,929
[RACHNELA/MIIA/CEREA/PAPI/MERO]
Of course.

231
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,698
[MIIA]
Okay, looks like it's up to us

232
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,099
to get Darling well again!

233
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,000
[PAPI]
Yay!

234
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,401
[CEREA]
Wait. Smith is right;

235
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:51,071
there'd be
serious trouble if we got
infected.

236
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:53,540
[MERO]
Ah, I can picture the tragedy
now!

237
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,910
[KIMIHITO](Cool)
Mero... I got you sick; it's all
my fault!

238
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,112
[MERO]]
You mustn't weep for me...

239
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:04,718
But please...
you must live on... for my..
sake now...

240
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:07,621
[KIMIHITO]
(worried)Noooo!

241
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,923
[MERO] (cheeky laughter)
[MIIA] (angry)

242
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,893
[CEREA]
If only one of us was resistant
to infection...

243
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:15,629
[SUU]
(hm?)

244
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:17,531
[KIMIHITO]
(coughing)

245
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,432
[CEREA]
Master? May I come in?

246
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,902
[KIMIHITO]
(hm?)Cerea...

247
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:26,439
[KIMIHITO]
Oh, Suu. You sounded like Cerea.

248
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,809
[CEREA](As SUU)
Master!... Can you hear my
voice?!

249
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:31,344
[KIMIHITO] (huh?)
[CEREA](As SUU)
We were instructed to keep our

250
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:33,446
distance to avoid
contamination... Therefore...

251
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:37,050
We have decided to have Suu take
care of you on our behalf!

252
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,619
[CEREA]
Well done Suu... Good!

253
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:40,654
[CEREA](As SUU)
Suu will be acting as a proxy
nurse,

254
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:42,556
so please ask her for
anything you need!

255
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:46,492
[MERO]
What a wonderful idea!... You're
quite resourceful, Centorea!

256
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,995
[CEREA]
Maybe so... but the real
obstacle is how

257
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,164
to teach Suu to
be a good caretaker... right?

258
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,566
[MERO/RACHNE/PAPI/MIIA]
(hmm...)

259
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,434
[SUU] (smile)
[MERO] (happy)Alright!

260
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:57,170
[MERO]
Here's something...Why don't we
have Suu play the part of the

261
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,440
Master? That way she can
learn how from experience!

262
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,309
[CEREA]
Good!... Let's teach her to take
his temperatu‐oh!

263
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,812
[MERO/RACHNELA/MIIA/PAPI]
(surprised)

264
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,948
[MIIA]
Whoa, is that her?!

265
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,716
[CEREA]
I didn't know she could do that!

266
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,618
[PAPI]
You're so cool, Suu!

267
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:16,356
[CEREA]
A.. Alright, Suu... P‐pay close
attention.

268
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:20,293
Put your forehead up against his
like this...

269
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:24,264
And feel his...
temperature...(gasp)

270
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:28,869
O‐oh dear... so hot...

271
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:34,575
That was intense! One of us has
a serious fever...

272
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:43,984
[KIMIHITO]
(surprised)Oh... that's nice and
cool, thank y‐

273
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,923
(splutter)No wait, Suu!... I
know this is kind of your thing

274
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:52,793
and all, but when I'm this sick
it might just kill me!

275
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,294
[KIMIHITO]
(gasp for air)

276
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,129
[CEREA](As SUU)
Your fever's over 100!

277
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,064
[KIMIHITO]
I almost drowned!

278
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,600
[MERO](As SUU)
Hello Master...

279
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,335
Please allow me
to take care of you for a little
while.

280
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:05,105
[KIMIHITO] What?
[MERO](As SUU) When we mermaids
are feeling sick...

281
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:10,577
The traditional cure...
is to take a long bath in a pool
with a blend of medicinal herbs.

282
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:13,547
If you soak long enough, any
ailment can be healed this way.

283
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:17,083
[KIMIHITO](Under)
(shivering)So cold... How long
do I have to sit here like this?

284
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:19,285
[MERO](As SUU)
You should recover in about a
week's time!

285
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,955
[KIMIHITO]
Are you kidding?!‐ I'll be dead
by then!

286
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,760
[MIIA](As SUU)
(smile)I knew the rest of you
guys would suck at this.

287
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,797
It's my turn to shine... At a
time like this, he needs his
nutrients!

288
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,999
[KIMIHITO]
(nervous)This isn't good...

289
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:39,472
[MIIA] Voila!‐ It's Miia's
special white rice porridge!
[RACHNELA/CEREA/PAPI](horrified)

290
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,145
[CEREA]
Actually, it looks pretty
decent.

291
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,147
[MIIA]
I've been practicing every day!

292
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:50,083
[MERO]
Rice porridge! I've never seen
it before.

293
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:51,652
[MIIA]
Want to try it?

294
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:52,653
[MERO]
May I?

295
00:15:52,753 --> 00:15:55,589
Thank you very much!(bite)

296
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:01,695
[SEA WITCH 8A]
(chuckle)This potion will grant

297
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,130
you human legs, Little
Mermaid...

298
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,300
But in return, you will suffer
the agony of your fins being

299
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,172
torn to shreds and experience
every torture of hell.

300
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:16,042
[MERO]
(dazed sigh)

301
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,111
[MIIA]
I used all the best ingredients
too...

302
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,514
White rice, white onions,
white sesame, white cabbage,

303
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:23,517
white peaches, white icefish,
white roe, white swan, white
egret

304
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:25,952
and just a little bit of
white chocolate to top it all
off!

305
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:29,623
[CEREA]
You thought white rice porridge
is just porridge with [all]
white ingredients?!

306
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:34,227
[MIIA](As SUU)
... bit of white chocolate to
top it all off!

307
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,230
[KIMIHITO]
(scared)Can I really eat this
stuff?...

308
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,233
I‐I feel like it might
actually kill me...

309
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:45,005
Huh?... Did you eat it already?

310
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,306
[SUU]
(nod)(huh?)

311
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:49,375
[KIMIHITO]
Aw... I REALLY appreciate that.

312
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,713
[PAPI](As SUU)
Ready, Master?... It's my turn
to play!

313
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:54,314
[KIMIHITO]
Can't I just go to bed?

314
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:57,518
[PAPI](As SUU)
My wings are soft...and they're
so warm too!

315
00:16:57,618 --> 00:16:59,653
I bet you'll
feel better if we snuggle!

316
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:02,789
[KIMIHITO]
You know... that sounds pretty
good, actually.

317
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:06,192
[PAPI](As SUU)
You heard him, Suu! Sleep next
to Master for me, would ya?

318
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,061
[KIMIHITO]
(shocked)

319
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:11,732
[SUU]
Suu... sleep next to... Suu...
Master...

320
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:14,134
[KIMIHITO](Under)
You're just gonna sleep next to
me?

321
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:15,936
'Cause It kinda feels like
you're gonna eat my soul!

322
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:21,307
(freaking out)What's
happening?!.. I'm scared!‐
(freaking out)

323
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:26,112
[MIIA]
Get your claws off him!

324
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,413
[PAPI]
Why are you so mad?

325
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:29,182
[MIIA]
Oh, I think you know why!

326
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:32,052
[CEREA/MIIA]
Don't you realize what that
looks like?!

327
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,089
[PAPI]
So?... It's Suu.

328
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,358
[CEREA]
I know that!... But it looks
wrong!

329
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,027
[MIIA]
Oh yeah?! Well if you can do
that, so can I!

330
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:42,395
[CEREA](Under)
What are you doing?!

331
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:45,365
[MIIA]
If you're drenched in sweat...

332
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:47,734
it's gonna make you cold...
Don't worry.

333
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:51,304
I'll use my body to wipe off the
sweat for you.

334
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,307
You like it?... Huh?(startled)

335
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:58,178
[CEREA]
That's so indecent! The best
remedy...

336
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,415
is to warm him up using your
own body heat.

337
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,117
Keeping a man warm in this
manner has been

338
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:06,352
a woman's job
since the beginning of time, you
know.

339
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:09,656
(surprised)
Ah... th‐therefore...

340
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,826
there's
nothing untoward about this in
the slightest!

341
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:17,163
C‐Centaurs have a higher body
temperature than humans,
after all...

342
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,165
It's 100 degrees,
just like horses.

343
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:25,271
So that makes us... the.. the
perfect species... for um...
warming up...

344
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:27,841
That said, my body temperature
is so high at the moment,

345
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:31,912
I'm afraid I'm more likely to
burn you, so I'm awfully sorry,
but it's probably best if you

346
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:35,381
let me recuse myself from this
one.‐ Forget I said anything,
Master...

347
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,784
[MIIA]
Then why don't you let me‐agh!

348
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,185
[PAPI]
(shove)No, me!

349
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,321
[MERO]
No! I'll do it!

350
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,189
[CEREA]
No wait... I'll do it.

351
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:49,596
[RACHNELA]
Honestly... I think that's quite
enough...

352
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:53,567
If Suu learns
something strange.. it's your
fault... Now‐(surprised)

353
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:58,572
[KIMIHITO]
Suu, what are you doing?

354
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:07,380
Whoa... hey! What the heck were
those other girls teaching you?!

355
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,417
[KIMIHITO]
I... think I'm at my...
limit...(ggh...)

yourself... We've been worried
about you.

00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:41,715
I guess you got stuck because of
all the rain, huh?

363
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:43,884
[SUU]
(nod)(huh?)

364
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:46,352
[KIMIHITO]
Here, take my umbrella.

365
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:52,659
Brrr!.. It's cold out here
though.. Let's go home. (
sneeze)

366
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:56,763
(sniffle) Well... anyway, don't
run off on your own.

367
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,432
I was afraid something happened
to you.

Suu.. what are you doing?!
Wait... I feel better now.

374
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:37,237

you watching over me this whole
time?

Thanks for your help... Suu.

378
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,081
[KIMIHITO]
Uh... Do I wanna know?

379
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:49,883
[MIIA]
Darling... you're up.

380
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:51,351
[PAPI]
Are you okay?

381
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:53,286
[KIMIHITO]
Yeah, thanks to Suu, I'm much
better.

00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,889
[MIIA/CEREA/PAPI/MERO/RACHNELA]
(surprised)
[PAPI] Wow, good job, Suu!

383
00:20:55,989 --> 00:21:00,093
[SUU]
Oh no... I was the one who made
him sick in the first place...

384
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:01,695
I'm sorry I ran off.

385
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:04,397
But I'm glad I could make
everything better...

386
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:07,133
because now
I know I love my Master!

389
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:13,574
[MERO] Are you sure?
[PAPI] We must have taught her a
bunch of words today.

390
00:21:13,674 --> 00:21:15,709
[CEREA]
Or Miia's food made her
delusional.

00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:17,343
[MIIA]
What do you mean you love him?‐

392
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,280
You mean, you LOVE HIM, love
him?!‐ I need to know!

00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,882
[SUU]
I need to know?

Not talking anymore?!

[SMITH]
What's all this noise?

396
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:28,154
Darling's room is quarantined,
remember?‐

397
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:29,623
You girls aren't
supposed to be in here.

398
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:32,258
[MERO]
Ooh, Miss Smith,
what a pleasant surprise...

399
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:33,527
We were just here to see...

400
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:35,662
[SMITH]
(sneeze)(sniffle)
[SMITH] Uh‐oh.

401
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:43,570
[SMITH]
Uh... it turns out I've got a
bit of a cold...

402
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,639
If you girls
could come over and nurse me
back to health,

403
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:48,509
I would really
appreciate it. (cough)

404
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:51,945
ZOMBINA
Aw, too bad!... Don't get me
wrong, we'd LOVE to...

405
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:55,248
But we wouldn't want to start up
a pandemic or anything like
that;

406
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:56,950
you understand, don't you,
Boss?

407
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,586
[SMITH]
(sneeze)Ughhh...

408
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:32,412
[MIIA]
Is he on a date with Smith?!

409
00:23:32,513 --> 00:23:34,380
[MIIA]
How dare he cheat on me?!

410
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,949
[CEREA]
We can't tell anything for
certain yet.

411
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:38,384
[MERO]
We need to go in and find out
for ourselves.

412
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:40,120
That's the only
way to be sure.

413
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,455
[MIIA]
Oh no! Where'd he go?
