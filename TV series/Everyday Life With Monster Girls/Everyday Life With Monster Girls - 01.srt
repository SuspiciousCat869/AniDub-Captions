Hey, Miia... It's morning. Time
to get up.

[MIIA]
Mmm... five more minutes...

Better yet, wait 'til my
body temperature goes up
five degrees.

Ah, uh Wait, hold on!

00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,900
W‐what are you doing
here in my bed?!

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,301
[MIIA]
Well, it's chilly,

13

and I'm having trouble
warming myself up!

Maybe you can help me,

Lamias are cold‐blooded
creatures, you know.

16

In that case, I'll go get the
bath started, okay‐?

YOU warm me up.

That's more like it...

I love feeling the heat from

Oh crap, she's cutting
off my circulation!

At this rate, I'm gonna pass
out! T‐time out, Miia!

If I don't get Miia
warmed up fast,

65
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,927
she'll fall asleep and
strangle me again.

66
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:24,364
I had to do quite a lot of
remodeling for her to be able to
live here...

Now all the rooms are super
huge.

Wait.

00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,873
How does she pee?

to‐gyaaah!

Ahh.. This is yummy... Japanese
baths are just the best.

Japan has these great things
called hot springs.

together one day!

[KIMIHITO]
(flailing) MIIA! Thanks for your
help,

86
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,749
but I don't need to be warmed
up any more than I already am!

87
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,919
[MIIA] You know...
they do have mixed bathing.
[KIMIHITO] M‐Miia...

88
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,322
[MIIA]
So we could even be in the same
bath at the same time.

89
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,657
Doesn't
that sound nice?

90
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,626
[KIMIHITO]
There it is again...

91
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,427
Uh, but don't you think that'd
be tricky

00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,295
with the Prohibited
Activities and all?

93
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,332
[MIIA]
Oh, it's not that bad, is it?

94
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,835
It's just a hot spring; what's
wrong with that?

95
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,637
[KIMIHITO]
A lot more than you know...

96
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:40,406
[MIIA]
I think it's an important
experience.

97
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,844
[MIIA]
I AM here for cultural exchange,
after all.

98
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:49,349
And don't worry, Darling...
I won't bathe with anyone else.

99
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,718
I want my first time to be with
you, okay?

100
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:55,589
[MIIA]
(shriek) That's cold!
Turn it off!

101
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,159
[MIIA]
My temperature's dropping!

102
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:03,429
[KIMIHITO]
Um my apologies... but this
facility doesn't offer mixed
bathing.

00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,331
[MIIA]
(discomfort)

104

mean!

Popular singing sensation ANM48
has released yet another number
one hit song!

108
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:28,689
That's right! As the world's
first musical group comprised of
demi‐human singers, they're
really making a splash!

109
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:32,325
Not only that, but they're all
super adorable too!

110
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:38,498
The sudden success of ANM48
is largely a result of the
legislation that was passed
three years ago...

111
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,301
[EMCEE 1B (Male)]
The Inter‐species Exchange Bill.

112
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:47,473
The bill was enacted to allow
interaction between humans and
non‐human species that,

113
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:51,377
until recently, were kept
secret by the government.

114
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:56,082
[EMCEE 1A (Female)]
In the past three years,
society has experienced
accelerated cultural exchange.

115
00:06:56,182 --> 00:07:00,687
So far, there have been no major
conflicts caused by these
adjustments.

116
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:04,725
Perhaps the world hasn't changed
much after all.

117
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,492
[KIMIHITO]
Well I gotta disagree with you
there...

118
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:10,496
This morning has been a total
freakin' nightmare.

119
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:15,502
[KIMIHITO]
(sigh) Ever since she got here a
few days ago,

120
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,104
it's been one
crisis after another...

121
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,205
[SMITH]
Indeed.

122
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,074
[KIMIHITO]
(freak out, fall)

123
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:27,180
[SMITH]
Good morning, Kimihito Kurusu...
What's your deal?

124
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,883
[SMITH]
Aaaww don't tell me you've
forgotten about me already?

125
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:34,220
[SMITH]
I am your interspecies exchange
coordinator... remember.

126
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,356
[KIMIHITO]
I know THAT Ms. Smith...

127
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,625
But why are you inside my house?

128
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,226
[SMITH]
I see I'm just in time for some
breakfast.

129
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,362
[KIMIHITO]
Sure, help yourself!

130
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,332
[SMITH]
Also... I'm here to make sure
you're not in violation of any
Prohibited Activity.

131
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,234
(nervous humming)

132
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,170
[SMITH]
The demi‐humans are here for
cultural exchange.

133
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,940
[SMITH]
In accordance with the
Inter‐species Exchange Bill,

134
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,211
anyone who harms the non‐human
species will be severely
punished.

135
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,946
[SMITH]
Since you are a host family,

136
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,816
I wanted to make sure you fully
understand the rules.

137
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,951
[KIMIHITO]
Ms. Smith, I already told you.

138
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,721
[KIMIHITO]
You brought Miia here by
mistake, remember?

139
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,123
That does not make me her
host‐family.

140
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,057
[SMITH]
I don't recall that.

141
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,726
[KIMIHITO]
Uuuhhh...

142
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,697
Come on! Jeez, for an exchange
coordinator you sure are sloppy!

143
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,965
[SMITH] Well, anyway...
[KIMIHITO] Nice segue...

144
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,234
[SMITH]
Miia says she'd like to stay
permanently...

145
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,104
And that means I'll need you to
know the law in great detail.

146
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:27,307
It's a good thing your parents
were transferred overseas.

147
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:28,875
[KIMIHITO]
Good for YOU maybe...

148
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,611
[SMITH]
More coffee, please.

149
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:37,183
[KIMIHITO]
Yes ma'am. I'm not gonna hurt
her, you know.

150
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,619
[SMITH]
You're not allowed to deflower
her, either.

151
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,686
[KIMIHITO]
(startled)

152
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,788
W‐what do you mean?!

153
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:42,989
[SMITH]
They can do it if they want
to...

154
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,592
They've got the parts that
matter.

155
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,360
[SMITH]
Has she propositioned you?..

156
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,229
The girls can be pretty frisky,
y'know.

157
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:50,463
[KIMIHITO]
(ggh...)

158
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,533
[SMITH]
However...

159
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:56,637
The demi‐humans are meant
to be representatives of their
entire species.

160
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,605
If she was defiled by human
hands...

161
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:03,009
well, let's just say
there would be a diplomatic
issue.

162
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,945
[SMITH]
You'd be arrested on the spot.

163
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,515
And your beloved guest would be
deported back to her homeland.

164
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,617
[SMITH]
(boo hoo)

165
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:14,988
Tragic, but that's the world we
live in.

166
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,890
[SMITH]
Wait.. you haven't already done
it.

167
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,226
[KIMIHITO]
Oh no‐of course not... I'm not
crazy.

168
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:24,130
[SMITH]
(curious) I'm sure you've
thought about it at least,
haven't you?

169
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,600
[SMITH]
She may be a snake from the
waist down,

170
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,004
but she's got charm,
a great rack, and beautiful
features to boot.

171
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,774
Not to mention she's smitten
with you.

172
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,341
Besides...

173
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,944
You seem like you're
easy to seduce.

174
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:38,979
[KIMIHITO]
Huh?

175
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,113
[SMITH]
(smile)

176
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:41,948
[KIMIHITO]
(yanked)

177
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,350
[MIIA]
Hey! What is going on here?!

178
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,487
Nobody touches my Darling,
not even you, Miss Smith!

179
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,723
[SMITH]
This poor kid has it pretty
rough.

180
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,791
[MIIA]
Understand?!

181
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,125
[SMITH]
Yes yes of course...

182
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:57,030
Anyhoo... I'd better
be on my way now.

183
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,266
[SMITH]
Well, "Darling"... As long as
you don't break any of the rules

184
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,135
I'm sure you'll be just fine...

185
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:03,136
See ya!

186
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,277
[KIMIHITO]
Uh hey... Miia?

187
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,479
Maybe you should go dry off...

188
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,782
You might get too cold again.

189
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:19,219
[MIIA]
Is the law... really that
important?

190
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:23,690
[MIIA]
You know... when I first came to
Japan...

191
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:30,263
[MIIA]
The moment anyone saw that I had
the body of a snake, they were
immediately put off by me.

192
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:35,001
[MIIA]
So, I was worried you wouldn't
like me either.

193
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:54,020
[MIIA]
But you accepted me, with a
smile on your face.

194
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:59,092
[MIIA]
It made me so happy, Darling.

195
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:03,530
[KIMIHITO]
Well, I had seen similar stuff
on the news,

196
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,666
so I knew you were
nothing to be scared of.

197
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,333
(surprised)

198
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,569
[KIMIHITO]
(panic)

199
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,037
That law doesn't
mean a thing to me...

200
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:14,675
Because... I really don't
care what you do to me, Darling.

201
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:17,744
[MIIA]
You can do whatever you want
with me.

202
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,681
[KIMIHITO]
Wait, Miia, I‐

203
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:23,216
[MIIA]
And if you wanted to deflower
me...

204
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:24,651
[KIMIHITO]
(struggle) Ah what're you doing?

205
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:28,655
[MIIA]
I'd let you... I want you to...

206
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:29,990
Because I...

207
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:34,294
[MIIA]
I love you, Darling...
very very much.

208
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,763
(breathing)

209
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,498
[KIMIHITO] Sorry.
[MIIA] (huh?)

210
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:39,900
[KIMIHITO]
I can't do this.

211
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,769
Why? It's because of those
stupid laws isn't it?

212
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,470
[KIMIHITO]
That's not what I meant.

213
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:47,007
(goofy pain)

214
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:50,744
[KIMIHITO]
It's gonna snap!

215
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:53,947
AAAAAUGGH!

216
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,817
[MIIA]
DARLIIIIIIIIIIING!

217
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:03,023
[MIIA]
I'm so sorry, Darling!‐ I really
am sorry!

218
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:04,525
[SMITH]
You're alright...

219
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,561
Your shoulder's out of socket.

220
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:09,429
(small exert)

221
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,598
[KIMIHITO]
(more pain)

222
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,366
[SMITH]
This poor poor dummy.

223
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,771
[MIIA]
I'm sorry! I'm sorryyyyyy!

224
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,747
[MIIA]
MonMusu!

225
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,519
[MIIA]
We're going on a date!

226
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:35,922
A date date date
with Darling! Woohoo!

227
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:36,957
[KIMIHITO]
(uncomfortable)

228
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,258
[SMITH]
About your date...

229
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:38,992
(clear throat)

230
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,360
I mean, your FIELD TRIP,

231
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,395
let's go through the rules
again, shall we?

232
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:47,033
The host family is never to
leave the demi‐human guest
unattended...

233
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,369
Stay close to her and make sure
she has all she needs.

234
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:52,038
[SMITH]
In other words, just show her a
good time!

235
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:55,208
[KIMIHITO]
No offense, Ms. Smith, you're
the exchange coordinator,

236
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,243
isn't
it YOUR job to take care of
Miia?

237
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,144
[SMITH]
(chuckle)

238
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,346
I'm a very busy woman, you know.

239
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,481
[KIMIHITO]
(sigh)

240
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:02,716
[SMITH]
Oh. And...

241
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:06,119
Don't take her to a sleezy
hotel, okay?

242
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:09,556
[MIIA]
Hurry, Darling!
It's time for our date!

243
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:10,290
[KIMIHITO]
(grabbed)

244
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,058
(scream)

245
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:36,983
[MIIA]
This is great!

246
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,586
I had it in my head that Japan
was super stuffy...

247
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,688
But they have some
fun things to do!

248
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:45,191
[MIIA]
The only thing I don't like
is that everything's meant for
humans,

249
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,927
so some things are too
small for me.

250
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,862
[Cheater]
No, I swear, honey,
I'm not cheating on you!

251
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:52,498
[MIIA] I wanted to do karaoke.
[KIMIHITO] Yeah, those rooms
are pretty tiny.

252
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:56,503
[KIMIHITO]
Well, not everything's been
updated for other species yet,

253
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:57,871
so what can you do?

254
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:58,839
[MIIA]
(happy)

255
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:00,240
Ooh, look, Darling!

256
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,510
It says they cater to every
species! Let's go!

257
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,112
[KIMIHITO]
Okay, if you say so...

258
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,416
[KIMIHITO]
Hey... Wait, this is a lingerie
store!

259
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,452
[KIMIHITO]
Uh, I'll just wait for you
outside‐(yanked)

260
00:14:12,553 --> 00:14:17,858
[MIIA]
Hold it! Ms. Smith said you have
to stay by my side at all times!

261
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,326
[MIIA]
Excuse me, where's your Lamia
section?

262
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,462
[SALESLADY A]
Over here. Feel free to browse!

263
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:23,664
[MIIA]
Thanks!

264
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:25,298
[KIMIHITO]
This is awkward...

265
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:30,470
[KIMIHITO]
Can she wear this stuff?

266
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:31,872
How would that even work?

267
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:32,873
[MIIA]
Well, Darling?

268
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34,541
Which do you like better?

269
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:38,078
Be honest..
I don't usually wear a bra,
so it's hard to decide.

270
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:39,880
[KIMIHITO]
(nosebleed)

271
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,948
Uh, I'm not a bra expert either.

272
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,617
Why don't you try them on?

273
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:44,851
[MIIA] You're right.

274
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:45,986
Here we go!

275
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,253
[MIIA]
(happy)

276
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,222
[KIMIHITO]
Can't you do it by yourself?!

277
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:53,459
[MIIA]
Don't be silly! We're supposed
to stay together no matter what.

278
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,197
Now then... Help me pick the one
that looks best on me.

279
00:14:57,297 --> 00:15:01,134
[MIIA]
I want... to wear something that
makes you happy...

280
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,737
I want you to
love me even more.

281
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:06,472
So give me your honest opinion.

282
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,440
[KIMIHITO]
(ggh...)

283
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,374
I LIKE ALL OF THEM!

284
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,511
LET'S JUST
BUY 'EM ALL, RIGHT NOW!

285
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:14,515
[KIMIHITO]
What is this thing?

286
00:15:14,615 --> 00:15:19,152
Is it like a silicone bra cup?
No, the shape's different...

287
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,922
The back is sticky, and it's
kinda warm...

288
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:23,724
[MIIA]
Um, Darling?

289
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:24,825
[KIMIHITO]
(huh?)

290
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,092
[MIIA]
I'm sorry...

291
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,427
I never should have made you

292
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:29,563
come into the changing room
with me so...

293
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:32,132
Would you please give me my
underwear back!

294
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:33,734
[KIMIHITO]
(confused)

295
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:35,569
[MIIA]
Don't be so pervy!

296
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,307
[KIMIHITO]
Oh! So that's how you...

297
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,108
[MIIA]
Quit it!

298
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,046
[MIIA]
Jeez, I'm surprised at you..

299
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,348
Only a creeper would steal a
girl's panties!

300
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,783
[KIMIHITO]
I didn't steal them!

301
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:51,117
I didn't even know what they
were!

302
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:52,318
It was an accident I swear.

303
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,987
[MIIA]
(giggle) If you're that curious,

304
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,089
I could always give you
a little peek sometime.

305
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,457
[RACIST GIRL]
(laughing)

306
00:15:57,558 --> 00:15:59,059
[KIMIHITO]
Look, I wasn't trying to do
that!

307
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,594
[RACIST GUY]
Hey, check it out!

308
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:03,597
[RACIST GUY]
That nasty worm thing
calls him "darling"!

309
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:04,698
(laughter)

310
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,366
[RACIST GIRL]
That's disgusting!

311
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,001
[MIIA]
(angry)

312
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:09,636

(shocked) Darling!

[KIMIHITO]
(pained)

316
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,509
[MIIA]
You did that on purpose!

317
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:18,044
[KIMIHITO]
Yeah... because of the law
remember.

318
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,479
[MIIA]
(surprised)

319
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,784
Humans aren't supposed to hurt
non‐humans, okay...

320
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:24,985
And that works both ways.

321
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:26,753
(wild laughter)

322
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,590
[KIMIHITO]
Which means, if you had hurt
them, you'd have been deported.

323
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,691

I've never seen one in person!

He's dating that thing?

[KIMIHITO]
Uh, excuse me...

330
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:45,271
[KIMIHITO]
Could you guys maybe not take
pictures of her please? Please?

331
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,875
[MIIA]
Darling... Could we maybe go
somewhere more private?

332
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:50,577
[KIMIHITO]
(think)

333
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,479
Where are we gonna find that
around here?

334
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,550
[WOMAN 1B]
(Distant) Where'd they go?

00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,619

way!

J‐just calm down... It's nothing
dirty; we're only here because
we had to hide‐

(happy sigh) The bath here
may not be as big as yours,

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,068
but that was amazing!

343
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,571
[KIMIHITO]
Ah.. Miia... what's up?

00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:18,672
[MIIA]
(crawl up)

345
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:21,141
I feel a whole lot better.

346
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,109
[MIIA]
But I didn't pack a change of
clothes...

347
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,211
I didn't know we'd be going to a
fancy hotel.

348
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,881
[KIMIHITO]
Oh, we're just staying for a few
minutes.

349

[MIIA]
What we're leaving?

350
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:30,917
Then why do people come here
anyway?

351
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:32,919
[KIMIHITO]
OH GEE I WONDER Haha...

352
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,588
[MIIA]
And what's this thingy for?

353
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:35,556
[KIMIHITO]
(hm?)

354
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:37,591
Oh God! Put that back!

355
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:47,200
[MIIA]
I guess humans really aren't
used to my kind yet, are they.

356
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,435
Even when people
are nice to us...

357
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:52,539
it's mostly just because of the
law.

358
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,742
[MIIA]
You've treated me so kindly,
Darling.

359
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:58,078
Is it because you're afraid of
getting arrested?

360
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,413
[KIMIHITO]
Huh? No, that's not‐

Look at me, Darling.

You see?

00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:09,656
I'm not scary.

00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,059
[MIIA]
I'm completely harmless!

367
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,295
You could do anything you wanted
to me...

368
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:16,697
I wouldn't fight back...

369
00:18:16,797 --> 00:18:20,834
I mean how can you be afraid
of me, knowing that?

That's enough out of you two!

388
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,489
[RACIST GUY]
Can you even bang a snake?

a (beep), does it?!

Oh, man up. You'll live...

You just sprained it a little,
that's all.

[KIMIHITO]
Thank you.

00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,603
So... what about them?

406
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:05,572

Don't worry... I was able to
settle the case out of court,

407
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:08,474
so you shouldn't get

There's a good boy.

Well then... Have a good night.

00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:30,130
[MIIA]
Um what did you do that for?

416
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,832
[KIMIHITO]
Eh, it's not a big deal.

417
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:35,769
I just moved in front of your
tail at the wrong time and got
hit.

418
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:39,039
[MIIA]
No... that's not what I'm
talking about.

419
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:42,843
[KIMIHITO]
Look... Humans get into
fistfights all the time...

That guy's trash..

421
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:45,378
I'd hate for you to get deported

422
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,447
for hurting a lowlife like him.

423
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:49,550
[KIMIHITO]
Besides, um...

424
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,118
It doesn't matter whether or not
you have a snake tail...

425
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:55,288
[KIMIHITO]
Point is, you're a girl‐who
cares what species you are?

426
00:20:55,388 --> 00:21:00,226
Those jerks were picking on a
girl for no reason... I couldn't
let that slide.

427
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:02,062
[KIMIHITO]
It was nothing more than that.

[KIMIHITO]
(tackled)

431
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,002
I guess this is my life now.

432
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:10,170
[MIIA] (happy snuggling)

433
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,539
Thank you! That makes
me so happy...

434
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:15,842
It's wonderful to know that you
think of me as such a lady!

435
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,111
[MIIA]
Okay, let's pick up where we
left off...

436
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:19,680
[KIMIHITO]
(panic)

437
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,515
Wait, I've already had all
I can take today!

438
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:22,616
Please! Stop. Please!

439
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:24,317
[MIIA]
Since it's my first time,

440
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:25,652
I don't want to go slow anyway!
Let's just get to it!

441
00:21:25,752 --> 00:21:27,287
[SMITH]
Oh, by the way, Darling...

442
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:28,855
What're we having dinner
tonight?

443
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,056
[MIIA]
(busted)

444
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:31,491
What are you doing here, Ms.
Smith?!

445
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:34,127
[SMITH]
Well. Trying to get a hot meal.

446
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:35,762
[KIMIHITO]
We didn't invite you.

447
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:39,265
[SMITH]
Y'know... saving your ass
can be rather exhausting.

448
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:40,901
[KIMIHITO]
Would you like to stay for
dinner?

449
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:42,035
[SMITH]
Are you sure?

450
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,937
I wouldn't want to impose,
but...

451
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:45,005
[MIIA]
(frown)

452
00:21:45,105 --> 00:21:46,339
And just when I thought things

453
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:48,208
were finally getting started...

454
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:49,910
[SMITH] Oh, right.. Miia...

455
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,311
I think this belongs to you.

456
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:52,345
[MIIA]
(horrified)

457
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:56,750
(long scream)

458
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:31,845
[KIMIHITO]
Who are you?

459
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:32,746
My name's Papi!

460
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:35,181
I'm Papi the happy,
poppy harpy!

461
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:37,383
Uh... Parpy happy what now?

462
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:38,685
No, Harpy the Papi!

463
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:41,087
Wait, that's not right...
Papi parpy...

464
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:44,925
[Centorea]
How fortuitous that we should
meet... This must be fate!
