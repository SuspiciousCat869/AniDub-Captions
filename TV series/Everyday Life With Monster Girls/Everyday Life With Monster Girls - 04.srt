1
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:03,570
[MIIA]
(big swoon)

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,173
I can't stop thinking about
what my Darling said to me!

3
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:09,910
[KIMIHITO]
Miia, starting now,
I'm going to date you

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,746
so I can prepare to take your
sweet hand in marriage...

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,080
What do you say, baby?

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,048
[MIIA]
(swoon)

7
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:18,051
Darliiiing!

8
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,327
[CEREA]
We're... we're getting
married...

9
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,329
[CEREA]
(determined)

10
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,398
If I'm to protect Master from
the guiles of those other two

11
00:00:32,498 --> 00:00:35,035
I'd better keep my trusted
sword in pristine condition.

12
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:36,570
[PAPI] Hey!
[CEREA] (startled)

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,872
Centorea, will you come
play a game with me?

14
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,240
[CEREA]
Not now, Papi...

15
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,942
I'm still polishing my blade.

16
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,044
[PAPI]
Come on, pleeeeease?

17
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,312
[CEREA]
I told you, I'm busy.

18
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,616
[PAPI]
(slide)

19
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,319
[KIMIHITO]
Alright, that looks just about
done to me.

20
00:00:53,419 --> 00:00:54,988
Time for dinner, everybody!

21
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:58,158
[PAPI]
Master! Let's play a game
together!

22
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:59,359
Please...

23
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,994
[KIMIHITO]
After dinner, okay?

24
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:02,162
[PAPI]
Hurry, hurry!

25
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,798
[KIMIHITO]
(yanked)

26
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,000
[PAPI] See, look,
you hold it like this!
[MIIA] Ooh, smells good!

27
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,704
[KIMIHITO]
You don't have fingers.
[MIIA]
Wonder what Darling made for d‐

28
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:13,740
[MIIA] (shriek)
[KIMIHITO/PAPI/CEREA] (hm?)

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,908
[CEREA]
(shocked)

30
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,042
What's happening?!

31
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:21,114
[MIIA]
(comic drowning)

32
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,818
(splutter)

33
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:03,149
[MIIA]
(groaning)

34
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,118
[KIMIHITO]
What the hell is this thing?

35
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,420
[CEREA]
It seems we have a slime.

36
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,123
[KIMIHITO]
Wow, really?
So... those are a thing?

37
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:15,395
[CEREA]
There are many species of
demi‐humans that have yet to be
acknowledged by your society.

38
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,564
[CEREA]
Slimes are one of them.

39
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,267
[CEREA] But have no fear!
[KIMIHITO] (uneasy)

40
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,269
[CEREA]
You're safe, Master...

41
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,038
I shall protect you from
anything!

42
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,406
[CEREA]
I swear upon my sword!

43
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:27,874
Even if it IS fake...

44
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,076
[CEREA]
No harm will come to you ever
again,

45
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,113
especially from a lower
life form such as a slime!

46
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,881
[KIMIHITO]
Uh, thanks I guess.

47
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:38,985
[PAPI]
Master! I wanna play a game
with you now!

48
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,721
Come on, you
said we could!

49
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,256
[CEREA]
This isn't the time
for such frivolity!

50
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,626
There's a dangerous creature
in the living room!
We need to be on our guard!

51
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,962
Papi really seems to love
her games, doesn't she?

52
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,466
[KIMIHITO]
(stunned)

53
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,868
[CEREA]
Stand down!

54
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,036
[KIMIHITO]
(hm?)

55
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,238
Get away from Master!

56
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:03,276
[CEREA]
(surprised) Wh‐why can I not
cut through it?!

57
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,279
[CEREA]
Slimes are always the weakest
enemies in video games!

58
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,014
My blade should've
destroyed it!

59
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:11,251
[KIMIHITO]
Wow, you're even more
into games than Papi!

60
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:14,521
[KIMIHITO/CEREA]
(quiet awkward)

61
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,623
(scream)

62
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,626
[KIMIHITO]
Ugh... you okay, Cerea?

63
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,262
[CEREA]
Uh‐yes... I think so..

64
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,566
I didn't know a slime could be
so powerful...

65
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,466
Ugh...

66
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,434
Now my entire body is sticky.

67
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,371
[KIMIHITO] (uncomfortable)
[CEREA] Are you hurt?

68
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,840
[KIMIHITO]
No, it's just...

69
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,642
Uh, I should probably
go take a shower!

70
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,878
[PAPI] (darting around)
[KIMIHITO] Be careful, Papi!

71
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:42,516
[KIMIHITO]
(sigh) Seriously what is it
with this chick?

72
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,353
[KIMIHITO]
Okay, so now there's a slime.

73
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,490
My life just keeps getting
crazier.

74
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,527
What should I do?

75
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:57,197
Guess I better call Ms. Smith
and tell her what's going on.

76
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:03,003
[CEREA]
Master? Um I was wondering if
you'd be alright with... ah...

77
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,540
[KIMIHITO]
Huh? Am I... "alright"?

78
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,842
Yeah, I guess I'm alright now.

79
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:13,479
Oh... I‐I see... Well then...

80
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,415
[CEREA]
I'm coming in!

81
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,450
(huh?)

82
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,953
(shocked)

83
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,822
[CEREA]
(long shy)

84
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,925
[KIMIHITO]
Whoa! What's this about?!

85
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,827
[CEREA]
No it's not what it seems!

86
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,029
I promise I'm not harboring
impure motives...

87
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,431
[CEREA]
But I was afraid the slime
could try to attack you again..

88
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:34,935
And.. as your servant,
I didn't want to leave you
in here all alone...

89
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:37,704
[CEREA]
I swear, it is only out of
necessity!

90
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,373
[KIMIHITO]
You could've at least kept your
clothes on, couldn't you?!

91
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,975
[CEREA]
Well I‐WAAAAAH!

92
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,677
(fall)

93
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:48,615
You see, Master,
I can't get all the sticky
slime off my body

94
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,384
so I was hoping you could help
me wash it off. That's all.

95
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,554
[KIMIHITO]
(mmmfff...)

96
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,859
[CEREA]
Oh dear... I'm sorry; I didn't
mean to cause so much trouble.

97
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,661
[KIMIHITO]
It's OK, don't worry about it.

98
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,796
Besides, the only reason you
got all dirty

99
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,965
is because you
were trying to save me, right?

100
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:08,168
So wait, if you can't normally
reach back here by yourself...

101
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:09,636
does that mean
you just never wash it?

102
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,337
[CEREA]
W‐well yes I wash it!

103
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:12,873
I use an augbesian of course!

104
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,908
[CEREA]
But today I need extra help
because‐

105
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:15,809
(startled)

106
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,377
(flustered)

107
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,545
Please Master, stop!

108
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,180
[KIMIHITO]
(huh?)

109
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,915
[CEREA]
Um... i‐it's just that...

110
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:24,150
y‐you don't have to wash around
my rear‐end...

111
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:30,256
[CEREA]
You see... that's a...
a bit of a sensitive area...

112
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:32,058
[KIMIHITO]
(hm?)

113
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:35,428
(freak out) I am SO sorry,
what was I thinking?!

114
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,965
[KIMIHITO]
Of course you wouldn't
want me to wash you there;
that's way too personal!

115
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,901
[CEREA]
You don't have to shout...

116
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,403
Uh.. I‐I'll just wash you
somewhere else then...

117
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:46,072
[CEREA]
(shocked)

118
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,708
[KIMIHITO]
That's bad too!

119
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:50,777
Sorry, I panicked!
I dunno what to do...

120
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,685
[KIMIHITO]
Why didn't she just get in the
tub in the first place...?

121
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,687
[CEREA]
(uncomfortable)

122
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,423
[KIMIHITO]
So anyway, I wonder why that
slime thing

123
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:06,026
attacked us all of
a sudden.

124
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:06,827
[CEREA]
Water...

125
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:07,694
Water?

126
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,195
[CEREA]
My best guess is...

127
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:12,065
the slime was probably looking
for a water source.

128
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,801
[CEREA]
First it was in the pot,
then it moved to the sink.

129
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,503
[KIMIHITO]
(thinking)

130
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,204
[CEREA]
I could be wrong, but it seems

131
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:21,441
to be in its nature to stay
close to water.

132
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,710
Yeah, that does make sense.

133
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,412
I guess the bathroom's not the
safest place to be, huh?

134
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:27,648
(laughing)

135
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:29,315
[KIMIHITO]
(surprised)

136
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:33,019
(looking)

137
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,692
[CEREA]
There you are.
En garde!

138
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,394
[KIMIHITO]
That's not your sword...!

139
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,898
[CEREA]
(pull back)

140
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,299
[CEREA]
(gasp, into shriek)

141
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,068
[KIMIHITO]
(fall)

142
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,169
[CEREA]
(dizzy)

143
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,403
[KIMIHITO]
Cerea! Stay with me!

144
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:51,471
It's gonna be alright!

145
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:52,606
(grabbed)

146
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:53,707
No, stop, please don't eat me!

147
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,208
I'm not very nutritious

148
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,910
and I probably taste awful!

149
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,779
If water's all you want,
I'll give you all the water
you can drink!

150
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,215
But you have to let me go
first, okay?

151
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,884
[KIMIHITO]
(huh?)

152
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,126
[KIMIHITO]
(shock)

153
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,427
It's girl‐shaped!

154
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:18,231
She must be another species
of demi‐human...

155
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,199
[SUU] (look)
[KIMIHITO] (startled)

156
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:20,333
[SUU]
(hug)

157
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,935
[KIMIHITO]
Hey! Wh‐what are you‐

158
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,136
(fall)

159
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,305
[KIMIHITO]
(nervous)

160
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,540
[SUU]
(light exerts)

161
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,841
[KIMIHITO]
(awkward)

162
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:31,778
[KIMIHITO] (struggle)
[SUU] (light exert)

163
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,446
[KIMIHITO]
(gasp for air)

164
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:36,517
(pant)

165
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,552
[KIMIHITO]
(look)

166
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,120
Hold on a second!

167
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,321
I mean, we just met,

168
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,557
this is a little too
sudden for me!

169
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,595
[SUU]
(light exerting)

170
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,430
[KIMIHITO] (nervous)
[SUU] (continued scrubbing)

171
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,399
Listen, Miss...
uh, slime girl...

172
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:58,872
I have a lot of questions,
but let's start with
"why are you washing me?"

173
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,407
[KIMIHITO]
WHOA! Hey, are you even
listening to me?!

174
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:02,776
[SUU]
(washing)

175
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,244
[KIMIHITO]
I appreciate the effort,

176
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:05,746
but I'd feel a lot better
if you'd stop doing that!

177
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:06,780
[SUU]
(more washing)

178
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,914
You don't understand

179
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,315
anything I'm saying, do you?

180
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,752
Of course this would
happen to me.

181
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:15,822
She's washing me just like
I was washing Cerea before.

182
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,958
[KIMIHITO]
So that's what's going on.

183
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,594
She imitates whatever she sees.

184
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,396
[KIMIHITO]
But why?

185
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:24,931
[SUU]
(happy)

186
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,367
Maybe this is her
way of trying to
communicate with me.

187
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:28,802
[SUU] (happy push)

188
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,304
[KIMIHITO]
She might not
be dangerous at all!

189
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,506
[KIMIHITO]
Uh...

190
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:33,707
[SUU]
(hm?)

191
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,643
[KIMIHITO]
Uh...

192
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,911
(realize)

193
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,813
[KIMIHITO]
Oh crap, I can't get out!

194
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,648
I‐I can't breathe!

195
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,483
Okay slime girl...
if you want to communicate,

196
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,886
then please read my thoughts
and let me out of here!

197
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:50,390
[KIMIHITO]
Damn, it was worth a shot!

198
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,692
Gotta do something...

199
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,459
gotta think...

200
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,495
I'm running out of time...

201
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,131
Everything's
starting to fade...

202
00:09:58,498 --> 00:09:59,633
No!

203
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,267
There's still one thing
left to try!

204
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,603
Here we go!

205
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,380
[KIMIHITO]
(gasp for air)

206
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,917
(panting)

207
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:20,621
[KIMIHITO]
Whew... I thought
I was dead for sure.

208
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:25,425
[KIMIHITO]
You know what,
you stay there for a while!

209
00:10:25,526 --> 00:10:28,128
[CEREA]
So you won by
diluting the slime.

210
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,430
Quite an impressive
strategy, Master!

211
00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:32,699
[MIIA] You're a genius,
Darling!
[PAPI] (darting past)

212
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,568
[KIMIHITO]
Oh no, I wouldn't say that...

213
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,202
I just took a big gamble.

214
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,572
For all I know she could've
absorbed all the water

215
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:41,542
and turned into some
gigantic monster.
[SUU] (drowsy laugh)

216
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,610
[KIMIHITO]
I gotta say,

217
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,345
I was surprised to see
it had a human form.
[PAPI] (dart past)

218
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,748
[CEREA/MIIA]
Human form?!
[SUU] (dart past)

219
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,783
Yeah, and a pretty
nice one at that.

220
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:50,751
[MIIA/CEREA]
What?!

221
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,185
Uhhh... sorry...

222
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,020
I mean... they uh...

223
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,288
(clear throat)

224
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,290
[CEREA]
A slime that can take
human form...

225
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,525
[PAPI/SUU]
(dart past x10)

226
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,093
[KIMIHITO]
Is that rare or
something?

227
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,028
[MIIA]
I never heard of one that
could do that before.

228
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,030
[CEREA]
I think we should report this
to Ms. Smith

229
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,199
before it gets out
of hand.

230
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,201
[KIMIHITO]
Who knows if she'll actually DO
anything though.

231
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:11,104
[MIIA]
She's the most irresponsible
person I've ever met.

232
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,974
[CEREA]
I wonder if it's alright to
just lock it in the bathroom?

233
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,942
[KIMIHITO]
Yeah I'm not so sure
about that.

234
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,812
[MIIA]
Right, it won't
be easy to... um...

235
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,547
[PAPI/SUU]
(ha!)

236
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:24,150
[CEREA] (nervous)
[MIIA/KIMIHITO] (awkward)

237
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,922
[PAPI] (hm?)
[SUU] (happy)

238
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:34,127
[SUU]
Mmmmooonnnmmmuuuussssuuuu...

239
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:42,836
[SUU]
Monnnmuusuuuu?

240
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,472
[MIIA]
(scream)

241
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:49,776
[MIIA]
That's my mug!
It's not for you!

242
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,211
[MIIA]
(angry)

243
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:54,681
That's the one that matches
Darling's!

244
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,149
[SUU]
(huuuuh?)

245
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,951
[CEREA]
Wh‐what have you done?!

246
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,453
My glorious blade
is all sticky!

247
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,156
[CEREA/MIIA]
It's time to pay
for what you did!

248
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,158
[KIMIHITO]
Whoa! Take it easy!

249
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,393
[PAPI]
Master's right!
Don't get mad at Suu!

250
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:10,664
It's not like she messed up
your stuff on purpose.
[SUU] (happy)

251
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:12,065
[KIMIHITO]
Suu?

252
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,067
Yeah, slime starts with S...

253
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,736
That's why I named her Suu!

254
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:16,837
[SUU]
Suu...

255
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,672
[PAPI]
Uh‐huh! Suu!

256
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,707
[MIIA]
Hey wait... Did she say
something?

257
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:23,910
[KIMIHITO]
She's good at imitating.

258
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,746
[CEREA]
In any case, it would be
indecent

259
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,614
to allow her to remain
in such a state.

260
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,415
[SUU]
(huh?)

261
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:30,584
[MIIA]
I know what you mean,

262
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:31,752
but if we put clothes on her,

263
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:32,853
they would slip right off.

264
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,421
[KIMIHITO]
Yeah... Oh!

265
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,893
[MIIA]
A raincoat!

266
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,195
[SUU]
(giggle)

267
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,964
[KIMIHITO]
It's perfect!
It doesn't absorb water,

268
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:45,699
and it won't be all see‐through
when it gets wet!

269
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,500
[MIIA]
You're so smart, Darling!

270
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:48,635
[SUU]
(happy)

271
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,170
[PAPI]
Aww, look how cute she is!

272
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,171
[SUU]
(giggle)

273
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,873
[KIMIHITO]
Uh‐oh...

274
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:55,609
[MIIA]
I think we just made her
sexier...

275
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:57,611
[CEREA]
Well now that I think of it...

276
00:12:57,711 --> 00:13:00,847
Wasn't she larger before?

277
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,216
I wonder what
would make her shrink.

278
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,451
[KIMIHITO]
Maybe she lost water
when she left the bath...

279
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,487
I guess this might be the size
she's supposed to be.

280
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:09,556
[PAPI] Papi! Call me Papi, ok?
[SUU] Pa.. pipi?

281
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:12,526
[MIIA]
But there's still one
problem here, Darling.
[KIMIHITO] Huh?

282
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,127
[CEREA]
It's only wise to assume

283
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,296
she didn't get to Japan
through official procedures.

284
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,331
[PAPI] Pa‐Pi!
[CEREA] She could've been
smuggled here.

285
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,534
Either intentionally
or by accident.

286
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,569
[SUU] Papi!
[KIMIHITO]
So she's an illegal immigrant?!

287
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,037
[PAPI]
(happy) I knew you could do it!

288
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,673
We should let Ms. Smith
decide what to do with her.

289
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,441
[PAPI]
Now say, Papi the harpy!
[KIMIHITO]
But if nobody knows

290
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:31,044
it's not like they
can send her back.

291
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,681
Well, I assume they would
place her on some sort of
probation...

292
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:35,982
...or else imprison her.

293
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:37,217
[KIMIHITO]
That's awful!

294
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,720
It's not like she's a criminal.

295
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,987
[PAPI]
Imprison her?

296
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,956
[CEREA]
But if we don't take action,

297
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:45,225
you might be punished as well.

298
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:50,063
[CEREA]
It's unfortunate...
but I believe the best course
of action for everyone involved

299
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,799
is for us to turn her in to the
authorities.

00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:57,203
[CEREA]
There's enough friction among
the species as it is.

301
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,739
And I highly doubt
this poor slime

302
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,041
could do anything to
overcome that friction.

303
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:04,444
[CEREA]
In fact, I'm sure she'd make
things worse.

[SUU]
(happy)

305
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,447

And then everything we've done

306
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:10,851
to create interspecies unity
would be lost.

Wait, Papi, what are you
doing?!

00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,494
Where are you going
with Suu?!

Are you okay, Suu?

00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,797
[PAPI]
Oh wow! You didn't get
hurt at all!

00:14:56,897 --> 00:15:00,400

You can't say the same for
everybody though...

329
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,937
[PAPI]
So... why'd you start wiggling
like that, Suu?

330
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:07,340
[KIMIHITO]
If I had to guess...

331
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,342
Maybe she's afraid of the
river...

332
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,578
I mean, she melted
in the bath tub.

333
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:14,014
[KIMIHITO]
She might've thought
she'd die

334
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,950
if she fell into
a big body of water.

335

Oh no! I'm sorry, Suu!

[KIMIHITO]
You can apologize to her later!

337
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,789
What did you run away for?

338
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:25,992
You are never supposed to leave
the house without me, remember?

339
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:30,096
[KIMIHITO]
And you took... uh, "Suu"...
outside with you too.

340
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:31,865
[PAPI]
I had to!

341
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:33,534
Because you guys were gonna
have her incested!

342
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:35,736
Even though she didn't do
anything to hurt you!

343
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:38,404
[KIMIHITO]
It's "arrested", we've been
through this...

344
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,641
And she did almost kill me,
remember?

So did everybody else!

I mean, the way
she protected Suu...

378
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:53,479

00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:48,855
[PAPI]
(strain)

456
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:49,856
[SUU]
Papi.

457
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,491
[PAPI]
(gasp)

458
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,329
[SUU]
Thank you Papi.

459
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:02,335
(splash)

460
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,270
[PAPI]
Suu...

461
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,342
[SUU]
Oookaaayyy!

462
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,443
[ALL]
(surprised)

463
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,846
[PAPI]
(determined)

464
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,751
[SUU]
(smile)

465
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,320
[SUU]
Papi.

466
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,156
[PAPI]
Suu!

467
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,225
[KIDS]
(happy)

468
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:29,663
[KIMIHITO]
She made it...
That was a close one.

469
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,232
[PAPI]
Master!

470
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:33,667
[KIMIHITO]
Papi!

471
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:36,670
[PAPI]
Suu! I was so scared!

472
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,471
[SUU]
Suu's okay, Papi, Suu's okay...
(cooing)

473
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,040
[PAPI]
Suu! (crying)

474
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,043
[KIMIHITO]
(two‐beat sigh)

475
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:47,447
[MIIA]
What do you mean she's
going to be staying with us
for a little while?!

476
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:49,583
[KIMIHITO]
Uh, I'm not sure how to
make it more clear...

477
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:52,986
Anyway, it's nothing to be
concerned about.

478
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,487
[SUU/PAPI]
(giggling)

479
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:55,756
I mean, it's not like
she's a bad person.

480
00:20:55,856 --> 00:20:57,558
She's just lacking in
common sense.

481
00:20:57,658 --> 00:20:59,125
[MIIA]
(surprised)

482
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,326
[CEREA]
Master, we talked about this!

483
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,228
What if something were
to happen‐

484
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:06,399
[KIMIHITO]
I can't just turn her in when
she hasn't done anything wrong.

485
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:08,401
[KIMIHITO]
Everything'll be okay...

486
00:21:08,502 --> 00:21:10,837
We just need to teach her
a couple of things, that's all.

487
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,073
[CEREA] But...
[MIIA] Darling...

488
00:21:13,173 --> 00:21:14,675
[KIMIHITO]
Gimme a break you two...

489
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,476
Just think of her as a child.

490
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:18,679
[CEREA/MIIA]
(thinking)

491
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:19,680
Like a child...?

492
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,047
[DAUGHTER A]
Mommy, Daddy!

493
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:23,049
[DAUGHTER B]
Mother, Father!

494
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:25,719
[DAUGHTER A/DAUGHTER B]
(giggling)

495
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:29,489
[MIIA]
Welll... I guess that wouldn't
be so bad after all...

496
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,525
[CEREA]
Oh, what is wrong with me?!

497
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:36,597
He's my master;
I should not have imprudent
fantasies like that!

498
00:21:36,697 --> 00:21:37,731
[KIMIHITO]
Listen, guys...

499
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:39,132
We can't tell Smith
about this.

500
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:40,701
[SUU/PAPI]
Okeedokee!

501
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,202
[KIMIHITO]
I sure hope they got that...

502
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:43,136
[MIIA]
Hey, Darling?

503
00:21:43,236 --> 00:21:43,937
[KIMIHITO]
Yeah?

504
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:45,338
What's up?

505
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:48,308
I'll talk to you
when I get inside.

506
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:50,844
[KIMIHITO]
Hey, we're hooome!

507
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:53,046
[MIIA]
Darling, Ms. Smith's
here right now,

508
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:54,014
so when you come in..

509
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:57,050
make sure she doesn't...

510
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,652
Oh. Oops.

511
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:35,348
[MERO]
Hello there, my name is Meroune
Lorelei, and I'm a mermaid...

512
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:39,452
I'll be residing here
starting today as part of the
homestay program.

513
00:23:39,553 --> 00:23:41,522
[MERO]
I'm pleased to make your
acquaintance...

514
00:23:41,622 --> 00:23:43,657
...new master.
