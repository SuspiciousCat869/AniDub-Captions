1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:05,138
[KIMIHITO]
Whoa! W‐wait a second! Time out!

2
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:09,109
[MIIA/PAPI]
Gotcha!

3
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,410
[KIMIHITO]
(pain)

4
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,378
[MIIA]
I'll never let you go,
Darling...

5
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:15,248
We're going to get married and
live happily ever after!

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,450
[PAPI]
Don't think so‐! Master's gonna
marry ME!

7
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:20,286
[CEREA]
No, the only proper wife for my
Master is ME!

8
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:22,288
[MIIA/PAPI/CEREA]
(glare)

9
00:00:22,388 --> 00:00:23,657
[MIIA] Darling!
[CEREA/PAPI] Master!

10
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:25,559
[KIMIHITO]
Uh (stammering)...

11
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:28,695
How did we get to marriage
all of a sudden?!

12
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:05,992
[MIIA]
Right. Now let's review the
Inter‐species Exchange Bill.

13
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,493
[MIIA]
Rule number one is...

14
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,430
humans and demi‐humans can never
do harm to each other.

15
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,098
[MIIA]
And rule number two...

16
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:15,368
You're not allowed to go out
unless your host family's with
you.

17
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,638
[MIIA]
And most importantly, rule
number three is

18
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:20,941
whoever has resided with the
host the longest has ultimate
authority!

19
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,876
[MIIA]
So you two better listen to
everything I say!

20
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,679
[CEREA]
You made that last rule up,
didn't you?

21
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,047
[PAPI]
Fascinating!

22
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,649
[CEREA]
Don't listen to her, Papi!

23
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,284
[MIIA]
Did you get all of that,
Centorea...?

24
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,753
Pay attention please!

25
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,154
[CEREA]
How dare you...?

26
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,923
I've read the Bill; it says
nothing of the sort!

27
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:40,126
[KIMIHITO]
Cerea...? Ms. Smith wants you to
fill out your home‐stay

28
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:42,228
application forms when you get a
chance to uh...

29
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,064
[MIIA] (anger)
[CEREA] (awkward)

30
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,100
[MIIA] If you know the rules,
why is there a horseshoe
mark on his face?

31
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,068
[CEREA] Um, well...

32
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,603
[KIMIHITO]
No wait, Miia!

33
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,605
I can explain...

34
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,641
[KIMIHITO]
Better get a bath started‐

35
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:55,241
[CEREA]
(surprised)

36
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,209
(quiet shock)

37
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:59,312
[KIMIHITO]
(quiet panic)

38
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,014
[CEREA]
(kick)

39
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,584
[KIMIHITO]
(scream)

40
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,852
[KIMIHITO]
I didn't think anybody was in
there...

41
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,387
I promise.

42
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,089
It was all my fault, okay?

43
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,791
[CEREA]
N‐no it isn't!

44
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:14,394
I was sweaty after my
morning run, so I
decided to take a bath.

45
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,530
I should have locked the door,
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,365
[KIMIHITO]
Nah, you don't have to
apologize.‐ I should've knocked.

47
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:20,634
[MIIA]
What's wrong with you‐?!

48
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,903
You are way too nice to her‐!
And you‐!

49
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:25,806
Those application forms aren't
gonna sign themselves!

50
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,007
[CEREA]
Ah.. right!

51
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,374
[MIIA]
All he did was see you naked‐!

52
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:29,275
You Centaurs can be so violent!

53
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,544
[CEREA]
Uh...What?!

54
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,513
You don't have any room to talk,
serpent!

55
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,948
Smith said you dislocated his
shoulder not long ago‐!

56
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,617
How is
that any different?!

57
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:40,286
W‐well, I just couldn't contain
my joy after he protected me...

58
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,888
[CEREA]
That's nothing,
I'll have you know

59
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,090
my Master took a villain's
blade to protect ME‐! so there!

60
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,859
[MIIA]
That's where you're wrong‐!

61
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,295
Darling defended my honor by
punching someone in the FACE‐!
So there!

62
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,632
[KIMIHITO] This isn't
gonna end well.
[CEREA] Any thug could do that!

63
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,399
[KIMIHITO] This isn't
gonna end well.
What Master did for ME
was heroic!

64
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:54,868
[MIIA]
It was a fake sword!

65
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:58,371
It's not like that guy could've
even hurt you!

66
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,239
[KIMIHITO] Papi!
(Miia and Cerea arguing under)

67
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,273
[PAPI]
Oh man...

68
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:01,575
This Inter‐skeezy whatever's

69
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,077
got way too many big words...

70
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,879
My head's all hot now.
I want a bath...

71
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,514
[CEREA]
My name is Centorea, and I'll
thank you to address me as such!

72
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,449
[KIMIHITO]
Uh.. then go ahead and take one.

73
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,118
[PAPI]
Master... I can't take a bath by
myself!

74
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,755
[KIMIHITO]
Huh...? Then why don't you ask
one of those two‐

75
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:17,057
[MIIA]
Yeah, well Darling and I have
taken a bath together!

76
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:20,994
[CEREA]
That may be so, but Master's
already touched me physically!

77
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,964
[MIIA]
Oh whatever he had no idea
what he was doing!

78
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:25,866
[PAPI]
(happy humming)

79
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:26,867
[KIMIHITO]
It's cold.

80
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,802
[PAPI]
Okay, let's go!

81
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:29,670
(happy)

82
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,505
[KIMIHITO]
Whoa, wait a minute!

83
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,140
You need to put on the swimsuit
Ms. Smith got for you first.

84
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,943
[KIMIHITO]
Though I'm not sure why it's a
SCHOOL swimsuit...

85
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,445
[SMITH]
It's the only style
that would fit her!

86
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:43,183
[PAPI]
But... I don't have hands‐
so I can't put it on myself.

87
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,485
[KIMIHITO]
Okay, wh‐where's the hole?

88
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,020
[PAPI]
I'm ready, Master...

89
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,655
[KIMIHITO]
It's my first time,

90
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,024
so I don't
really know how to do this...

91
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,192
[PAPI]
Is it going in?

92
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,827
[KIMIHITO]
Yeah, all the way...

93
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,161
[PAPI]
Ahh... it sure is!

94
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,263
[KIMIHITO]
Wow, it's really tight...

95
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,565
[PAPI]
Y‐yeah...

96
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,501
[KIMIHITO]
Okay now you just have to put it

97
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:01,902
into the other hole.

98
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,269
[PAPI]
Like this?

99
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,906
[KIMIHITO]
Well, I can't see,
so I'm not sure.

100
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,574
[PAPI]
(small exert)

101
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:12,045
(gasp) Master...
don't tickle me like that!

102
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,279
[KIMIHITO]
(ggh...)

103
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,415
Uh... now you need to use some
pressure

104
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:16,917
and just push it
through...

105
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:20,220
[PAPI]
Mmm... but my feathers are
getting in the way.

106
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,823
[KIMIHITO]
I‐it's okay, it should stretch.

107
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,491
[PAPI]
(surprised)

108
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,061
[KIMIHITO]
(fighting a boner)

109
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,896
[PAPI]
(shy)

110
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,965
Master...

111
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:39,640
[KIMIHITO]
You know what...? I think I need
to cool off for a little bit...

112
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,042
Go ahead and play, alright?

113
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,613
[PAPI]
Okay, I'll cool off with you!

114
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,915
(giggle)

115
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,852
[PAPI]
The water's so nice!

116
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:54,387
[KIMIHITO]
I'm like an otter with its baby.

117
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,557
[PAPI]
More like brother and sister!

118
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:58,258
If I had an older brother,

119
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,994
I'd want him to be just
like you, Master!

120
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:01,962
Me?

121
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:03,129
Yup! I really like the way

122
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,631
you always play with me...

123
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,200
and how you never get mad at me
when I do bad things...

124
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,435
You're the best ever!

125
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,004
[PAPI]
There aren't any boy harpies...

126
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,074
so I don't know what it would be
like to have a brother...

127
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,208
[PAPI]
But still...

128
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,777
I've always WANTED a brother...

129
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,112
so I'm really happy
that I met you!

130
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,013
[KIMIHITO] (surprised)

131
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,582
Oh... well I..

132
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:24,017
I guess there's nothing wrong
with being your big brother...

133
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,085
[PAPI]
(stand up)

134
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,954
Okay, let's get even closer...

135
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:28,855
[KIMIHITO]
(shocked)

136
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,123
Ah‐what are you...?!

137
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,859
It felt really nice when you
touched me here before...

138
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,661
My heart was beating really
fast!

139
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,564
I want to do it some more,
if that's okay with you?

140
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,700
[KIMIHITO]
Uh, not if we're brother and
sister!

141
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,636
[PAPI]
Hey, don't push me away!

142
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,137
Rggh, fine!

143
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,172
If that's how you're
gonna beeee!

144
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,007
[KIMIHITO]
(fear)

145
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:47,974
[PAPI]
(scream)

146
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,576
(shocked)

147
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:54,314
[CEREA]
Honestly! I'd expect this
behavior from a child...

148
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,349
but now that I know that you're
my age...

149
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,752
[CEREA]
Well, I simply cannot tolerate
it!

150
00:06:58,852 --> 00:06:59,485

00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,987
Let me down from here!

[KIMIHITO]
Cerea...

153
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,157
[CEREA]
Now then, Master...

154
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,592
P‐please mount me...

155
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,160
[KIMIHITO]
Huh...? What?

156
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,929
[MIIA]
I don't think so!

157
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,731
Did you think you could
hide from me?...!

158
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:13,499
Ms. Smith'll be here to get your
homestay paperwork soon.

159
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,601
[MIIA]
Now hurry up!

160
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,937
Get your hooves off Darling and‐

[CEREA]
Papi should cool down shortly...

163
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,047
We just need to give her some
time.

[CEREA]
Are you alright, Master?

167
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,723
[KIMIHITO]
Oh, yeah, I'm okay...

168
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:40,326
And my clothes are all dry now
from riding on your back too.

169
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,195
[CEREA]
I see... Then..

170
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,397
would you mind moving your
hands?

171
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:45,198
[KIMIHITO]
(horrified)

172
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,300
Ah...! Sorry!

I‐I didn't mean to!

175
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,437
[CEREA]
Ah.. no.. That's alright...

176
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,641
[CEREA]
I am my master's servant, after
all, so it's not a problem.

177
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,677
[KIMIHITO]
Come on, "servant"?

178
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:57,644
Isn't that a bit much?

179
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,546
[CEREA]
No, not at all!

180
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,382
I am a Centaur...
My people are proud warriors

181
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,585
who carry the ultimate loyalty
for our masters!

[WALLA: Men]
(battle charging)

183
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:06,653
For that reason...

184
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,421
I am honored to have a
master to serve!

185
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:13,326
Just like my father,
my grandfather, and
great‐grandfather before me!

186
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,729
I am a knight before
I am a woman!

187
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,631
This is the way Centaur‐kind
operates...

188
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,465
So no, it is not too much.
[Men] Hear, hear!

What is that, your Stand?!

But hey...

00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,073
You're in Japan now, remember?

194
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,876
Now I know that your culture's
important to you, but...

195
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:33,379
[KIMIHITO]
... but you're allowed to relax
your shoulders a bit.

196
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,881
[CEREA]
I don't know...

197
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,851
You came here because of
cultural exchange, didn't you?

198
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,586
So why not take advantage of it.

199
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,255
[KIMIHITO]
Can't you think of anything new
out there you want to do?

200

I dunno, you pick!

You can tell me.

[CEREA] Your hand...
[KIMIHITO] (huh?)

00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,907

I‐I think I'd like to hold...

00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,576
your... hand...

211
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:05,145
Well... I've only ever held
swords and bows...

212
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:08,549
so I thought maybe it might be
kinda nice... because...

Th... that's what human girls
do...

214

I... it wouldn't mean
anything...

unless you wanted it to...

Oh no.. wait... That wasn't
proper of me at all...

I can't say such things
to my master‐!

You could've let me down gently!

What are you two doing here?!

that you mustn't go out alone!

Shut up! First you
kidnap my Darling,

then you take him off somewhere
to make out with him‐?

I thought Centaurs were all
about honor!

[CEREA]
That is quite enough‐!

The last thing I need is a
lecture about honor

from a conniving viper...!

254

And why do you keep calling him
"Darling"‐?!

Don't tell me you believe
you're his wife?!

That's funny; who knew I would
accidentally hit you instead...!

And 3 times at that...

It's just... well, if we hadn't
been acting so selfish,

289
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:59,586
then none of this would've ever
happened to you...

That's why we made a decision,

From now on, we'll do whatever
we can to hold back

00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,680
and you shouldn't start fights.

304
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,481
[MIIA]
Darling!

305
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,917
[KIMIHITO]
But the one who's REALLY to
blame for all this is Ms. Smith!

306
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:33,086
[SMITH]
(long spit take)

307
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,722
[KIMIHITO]
Stuff happens. But the whole
point of this home‐stay thing

308
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:38,358
is to learn to get along with
each other, right?

309
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,661
And since we're all in this
thing together...

310
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,763
I'd say that kinda makes us a
family.

311
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:44,430
[CEREA/PAPI/MIIA]
Family...

312
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:47,668
[KIMIHITO]
So, no matter what complicated
junk gets in our way,

313
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,002
just keep being yourselves.

314
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,270
[CEREA/PAPI/MIIA]
(happy)

315
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,171
[MIIA]
Darling‐

316
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,573
[SMITH]
I couldn't agree more!

317
00:12:52,673 --> 00:12:53,940
[KIMIHITO/MIIA/PAPI/CEREA]
(stunned)

318
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,742
[SMITH]
Family... of course.

319
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,078
(chuckle)
This is too perfect.

320
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:00,781
I knew I was right to ask
Darling to look after them.

321
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,415
[KIMIHITO]
(huh?)

322
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:05,151
[SMITH]
Speaking of which, there's been
a movement recently

323
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,220
to amend the
Inter‐species Exchange Bill.

324
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,824
Well... most of the proposed
changes are just boring legal
jargon...

325
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:15,629
but there IS an article that
would allow marriages between
humans and demi‐humans.

326
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:19,265
Unfortunately, it's difficult to
predict whether it'll actually
work in practice,

327
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,934
so I've been looking
for a test case.

328
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,836
[KIMIHITO]
Really?

329
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:27,040
[SMITH]
And that's why you're going to
marry either Miia, Papi, or
Cerea...

330
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,875
Have fun. Choose carefully.

331
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:29,776
[MIIA/PAPI/CEREA]
(surprised)

332
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,044
[KIMIHITO]
(shock)

333
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,345
Marry?!

334
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:36,983
[SMITH]
MonMusu.

335
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,257
[MIIA/PAPI/CEREA]
MonMusu!

336
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,029
[KIMIHITO]
Ms. Smith...
Why did you bring up marriage?

337
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,931
[SMITH]
Well, marriages between species

338
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:53,199
really are the next logical step
in our progression,

339
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,401
even if it causes a
few hiccups early on.

340
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,604
[SMITH]
And that's why
we're doing a test.

341
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:58,939
[KIMIHITO]
No! What I mean is,

342
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,941
you can't just tell
somebody to get married!

343
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,443
[KIMIHITO]
This isn't the way it's supposed
to work!

344
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,111
What do I do?!

345
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,613
[CEREA] (sad)
[PAPI/MIIA] (concerned)

346
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,014
Hmm... just go with your gut.

347
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,550
[KIMIHITO]
Is that supposed to help?...!

348
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,652
Hey.. hold it!

349
00:14:11,752 --> 00:14:13,587
So that's it,
you're just gonna leave?!

350
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:14,888
[SMITH]
That's all I got...

351
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:16,356
My business is done here.

352
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:17,824
[KIMIHITO]
(stunned)

353
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:20,393
[SMITH]
Bye... Have a good night!

354
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:27,000
[KIMIHITO]
(big shock)

355
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,669
[SMITH]
Can't help but think...

356
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:30,504
That I left something out.

357
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,906
[SMITH]
Oh well.

358
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:41,047
[KIMIHITO]
I can't believe I'm being forced
to get married.

359
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,449
[KIMIHITO]
But if I touch them,
I'll go to jail?

360
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,587
[KIMIHITO]
Well... it's a good thing I
haven't tried to do anything...

361
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:49,956
Though they really aren't
making it very easy for me
with the way they act‐

362
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,626
Oh man I'm in trouble!

363
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:56,597
[KIMIHITO]
(thinking) Marriage, huh?

364
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:57,564
(knock)

365
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:58,699
[KIMIHITO]
(startled)

366
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,234
[MIIA]
Darling... are you awake?

367
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,637
[KIMIHITO]
Miia?

368
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:07,073
[MIIA]
Sorry to bother you, but you're
acting kind of strange...

369
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,709
I'm worried about you.

370
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:10,343
I guess... you're upset because

371
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,946
you don't want to marry
any of us, is that it?

372
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,481
[KIMIHITO]
Uh‐no... not exactly.

373
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,318
I was just taken aback 'cause
she was trying to force me...

374
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,787
It's not like I'm against
marriage, y'know.

375
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:22,022
[MIIA]
Really?

376
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:23,857
[KIMIHITO]
Well, that's not quite all.

377
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:26,192
I've never even had a girlfriend
before.

378
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:30,496
Plus I've never... you know...
"been" with a girl...

379
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,898
[MIIA]
I see.

380
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:34,067
So it's not that you
don't want to.

381
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,301
[KIMIHITO]
Miia...

382
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,137
[MIIA]
I knew you couldn't possibly be

383
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,239
having doubts about marrying me,
Darling.

384
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,274
[MIIA] You're so sweet.
[KIMIHITO] (startled)

385
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,443
[MIIA]
And you are so pure...

386
00:15:43,544 --> 00:15:47,147
[KIMIHITO] (nervous)
[MIIA] A few of the many things
I love about you!

387
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,482
[MIIA]
Hey... you know something...?

388
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:54,087
When snakes copulate...
they do it all night long.

389
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:57,090
They wrap their entire bodies
around each other

390
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,760
from their heads to
the tips of their tails.

391
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,131
They get so close you can't
even see where one ends
and the other begins.

392
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,603
[MIIA]
Darling... I'm ready for you...

393
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:14,708
I want us to become one,
right now.

394
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,242
[KIMIHITO]
What is up with her?!

395
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,112
I mean, she's always really
clingy and lovey‐dovey...

396
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:24,150
But tonight she's... well...
she's being very aggressive!

397
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,755
[KIMIHITO]
M‐Miia! Wait!

398
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,528
[KIMIHITO]
(fall down)

399
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:35,461
Are you okay?!

400
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:36,229
[PAPI]
Uh‐huh...

401
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,031
[KIMIHITO]
What the‐?!

402
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,366
Wh‐why aren't you wearing
any underwear?!

403
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,236
[PAPI]
Oh... don't worry,
you can look at me...

404
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,039
We're gonna get married anyway,
so it's okay, right?

405
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,308
[KIMIHITO]
THERE IS NOTHING OKAY
ABOUT THIS.

406
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,076
Do you even know
what marriage IS?!

407
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,845
[PAPI]
(shift weight)

408
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:53,814
Yeah, it's when you mate
and lay eggs.

409
00:16:53,914 --> 00:16:54,881
[MIIA]
(dazed pain)

410
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:55,949
[PAPI] First you insert your ‐

411
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,050
[KIMIHITO]
Don't be so graphic!

412
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,885
I know how it works, I promise!

413
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,821
[PAPI]
Graphic...? It's fine...
(unbuckling)

414
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:02,488
I'm a grown‐up too.

415
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:04,357
I can lay eggs.
[KIMIHITO] (react)

416
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,793
[PAPI]
I mean I'm old enough to mate.

417
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,562
I'm not some little kid okay.

418
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:11,965
[PAPI]
The two of us should make lots
of eggs, Master.

419
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,801
[KIMIHITO]
Now Papi's acting all weird too.

420
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:18,639
Dammit, Ms. Smith, why did you
have to bring up getting
married?! (galloping hooves)

421
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:20,340
[KIMIHITO]
(slammed)

422
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:22,743
[CEREA]
(shock)

423
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:23,710
[PAPI]
(weak collapse)

424
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,745
[CEREA]
I'm too late!

425
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:26,279
[MIIA/PAPI/KIMIHITO]
(pain)

426
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,015
[KIMIHITO]
Hey, good timing...

427
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:32,653
I dunno what's gotten into
those two tonight.

428
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:33,954
[CEREA]
I'm not surprised.

429
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,989
[CEREA]
There's a full moon tonight.

430
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:38,625
It puts their beastly
instincts into overdrive.

431
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,160
[KIMIHITO]
A full moon?

432
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,428
[CEREA]
That, combined with all that
talk of marriage,

433
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,632
must have caused them to lose
their senses.

434
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:46,867
[KIMIHITO]
I had no idea...

435
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:48,702
So.. why aren't YOU like that?

436
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:50,103
[CEREA]
Don't be silly!

437
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:53,473
I wouldn't abandon all reason
over a full moon!

438
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:56,142
I've sworn eternal loyalty to
you, Master.

439
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,311
My body and soul
belong to you...

440
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,814
You can do anything
you wish to me!

441
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:04,417
[CEREA]
I mean that makes us practically
married anyway, right?!

442
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:08,088
Here! Please touch me to your
heart's content...

443
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:09,255
I insist!

444
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:10,524
[KIMIHITO]
I don't care what you say,

445
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:12,225
you're just as crazy
as the other two!

446
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:13,326
[CEREA]
(Oh!)

447
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,961
Perhaps you'd prefer this!

448
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,129
Ah?!

449
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,832
[KIMIHITO]
(nosebleed)

450
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,834
(straighten up)

451
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,669
[MIIA]
Darling...

452
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,137
Get closer!

453
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:27,273
[PAPI]
Forget her, Master.
You're mine!

454
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:30,711
[CEREA]
My master only has eyes
for his devoted servant!

455
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:33,346
[KIMIHITO]
She wasn't kidding, their animal
instincts

456
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,081
really are getting
the best of them.

457
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,817
They're out of control!

458
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:39,252
If I DID try to do something
with one of them...

459
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,688
I'd probably have a heart
attack!

460
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,857
(scream)

461
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,726
(scream)

462
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:46,593
(pain)

463
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:47,528
[MIIA]
Not so fast!

464
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,295
You can't run from me, silly...!

465
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:52,666
We're destined to be together;
I'm never letting you go!

466
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:54,968
[PAPI]
But I want you to fertilize
my egg for me, Master!

467
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:57,571
[CEREA]
I'm going to be your wife,
and I will not surrender!

468
00:18:57,671 --> 00:18:59,439
[MIIA] Darling!
[PAPI/CEREA] Master!

469
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:04,611
[KIMIHITO]
(startled at phone vibration)

470
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,814
[SMITH]
Hey, Darling, it's Smith.

471
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:08,915
[KIMIHITO]
What now?!

472
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,383
[SMITH]
I forgot to tell you,

473
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,685
it's a full moon tonight.

474
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:13,319
[KIMIHITO] (phone)
Gee, thanks for the info!

475
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:14,688
At the rate we're going

476
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:16,389
we're gonna have a funeral
instead of a wedding.

477
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,558
[SMITH] (phone)
Which one did you bang?

478
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:19,025
[KIMIHITO]
Didn't 'bang' anyone...!

479
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,027
Oh... and thanks, by the way...

480
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:22,896
You just HAD to say
"marriage"...

481
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,598
Now they've lost their minds!

482
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:26,032
[SMITH]
Hmm...

483
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:29,736
So... I take it that means you
haven't made your decision yet?

484
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:31,638
[KIMIHITO]
(huh?)

485
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:34,374
[SMITH]
You don't know who you want
to marry?

486
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,276
[KIMIHITO] (phone)
Uh, I've been a little busy!

487
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,444
[SMITH]
Please tell me you at least
talked to them...

488
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:40,681
You need to keep them
in the loop.

489
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:42,015
But no... after I left,

490
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:44,685
you ran to your room and locked
yourself in, didn't you?

491
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:45,986
[KIMIHITO]
(awkward)

492
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:47,688
[SMITH] (phone)
If you don't tell them
how you feel,

493
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:49,089
they'll get insecure.

494
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,157
That's why they're acting
so desperate.

495
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:55,428
[SMITH]
Well... best I can say is...
just try to cool them off.

496
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,497
[KIMIHITO]
(phone)
How am I gonna do that?

497
00:19:57,598 --> 00:19:59,199
[SMITH]
You've got a fridge, right?

498
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,201
[KIMIHITO]
Yeah...

499
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:03,003
[SMITH] (phone)
Try using ice cubes.

500
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:04,170
[KIMIHITO]
Seriously?!

501
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,672
[SMITH]
(splash; distortion)
Ah!

502
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,908
Crap I dropped my phone
in the tub...!

503
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:09,342
[KIMIHITO]
Hello...?!

504
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:12,212
Please, you can't ditch me now,
I need your help!

505
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:14,047
[MIIA/PAPI/CEREA]
So this is where you've been!

506
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:15,782
[KIMIHITO]
(shock)

507
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,720
[PAPI]
That was so close!

508
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,288
[CEREA]
I'll never let you out of my
sight again, Master.

509
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,725
[MIIA]
Darling, what have you been
doing in here?

510
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:26,527
You're soaking we‐

511
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:28,729
[CEREA]
(gasp)

512
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:29,730
[PAPI]
(gasp)

513
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,731
[MIIA]
(gasp)

514
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:32,132
[MIIA] Darling!
[CEREA/PAPI] Master!

515
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,066
[KIMIHITO]
(huh?)

516
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,267
Yeah, I'm here.

517
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,069
[KIMIHITO]
(look around)

518
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:39,139
Ohhh, it's ketchup.

519
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,675
I hope I can get this out
of my clothes.

520
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,511
[MIIA] Darling...
[CEREA/PAPI] Master...

521
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:46,547
[KIMIHITO]
Hey, you aren't freaking out.

522
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:48,515
You guys must be feeling better.

523
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,893
[KIMIHITO]
Miia, wake up... It's morning.

524
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:00,927
[MIIA]
(stir)

525
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:02,062
[PAPI]
(light snore)

526
00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:04,164
[KIMIHITO]
Papi, Cerea, you too.

527
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:07,167
[MIIA]
(yawn)

528
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,169
[MIIA]
Oh... g‐good morning...
Darling...

529
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,336
(gasp)

530
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,672
[KIMIHITO]
Is it though?

531
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:13,907
[MIIA]
Ah...! What happened to you?

532
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:16,510
[PAPI]
Master... did you get
into a fight?

533
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,278
[CEREA]
I do hope you're alright...

534
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:21,214
[KIMIHITO]
Of course I am...!
Well, Not really...

535
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:22,583
[KIMIHITO]
But I was indecisive.

536
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:24,117
So when it comes to last night

537
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:25,318
there's no one to blame but me!

538
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:26,920
[CEREA/PAPI/MIIA]
(confused)

539
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,389
[KIMIHITO]
I shouldn't have made you guys
feel insecure...

540
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,825
I'm gonna try to
make a decision soon!

541
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:33,093
[CEREA]
A decision?

542
00:21:33,193 --> 00:21:34,661
[KIMIHITO]
(clear throat)

543
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:36,630
[KIMIHITO]
I'm going to date
all three of you

544
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,231
and figure out
who I want to marry!

545
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:40,433
I mean... you know, if that's
alright...

546
00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:41,702
[CEREA/PAPI/MIIA]
(surprised)

547
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:43,904
[KIMIHITO]
And that being said!

548
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:45,572
[CEREA/MIIA/PAPI]
(eager)

549
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,041
[CEREA/PAPI/MIIA]
(worried)

550
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,943
[CEREA/PAPI] Master!
[MIIA] Darling!

551
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:54,114
[KIMIHITO]
Could you three please
try to go to bed early

552
00:21:54,214 --> 00:21:55,716
when there's a full moon?

553
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:44,925
[SUU]
(extended scrubbing exerts)
