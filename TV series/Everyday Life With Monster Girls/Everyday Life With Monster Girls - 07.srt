00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:04,738
[ADVERT GIRL A]
Get your fix of
cute anime girls today!
(machinegun fire)

00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:09,275
[GUY A]
(cowering)

3
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:10,744
[GUY B/GUY D]
(shock)

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,113
[ORC A]
(grin) Fellow anime fans..

5
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:15,582
may I have your
attention please?

6
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:19,085
[ORC A]
We're sorry to barge in...
but this fine establishment

7
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:25,025
is now property of P‐O‐R‐K:
the Pioneer Orc
Renaissance Kinsmen!

8
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,724
[F. AGENT A]
We can't get a clear
understanding of the situation
since the blinds are closed.

9
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:06,392
[F. AGENT A]
But according to the people
running out of the building..

10
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:09,162
the criminal group
consists of six Orcs.

11
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,231
[F. AGENT A]
They're all carrying weapons.

12
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:15,736
Apparently, they've taken
a cashier and three customers
hostage inside the store.

13
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,505
[CHIEF]
Have they stated their demands?

14
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,240
[F. AGENT A]
Well...

15
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,045
The P. O. R. K. demands that
mainstream adult manga

16
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:31,251
must be changed to depict
the protagonists as
orcs paired with female knights!

17
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,319
(laugh) Your body doesn't lie!

18
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:38,158
[F. KNIGHT A]
I hate to admit it,
but it feels so good!
More, more!

19
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:43,797
[ORC A]
And we want variety!
Orc x elf, orc x sister type.
whatever we can get!

20
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:47,267
[CHIEF]
(speechless)
He's not serious...

21
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,070
[F. AGENT A]
Not just that..
they also want new genres

22
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,206
like "orc x witch",
"orc x teacher",
the list goes on.
[CHIEF] (long speechless)

23
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:59,145
[F. AGENT A]
Their demands may be absurd,
but the issue is that orcs
are a non‐human species.

24
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,047
According to the Interspecies
Exchange Bill,

25
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:04,117
they're technically not
acting outside their rights
in this case.

26
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,953
Which means that there's nothing
we can legally do to stop them.

27
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,990
[CHIEF]
Are you telling me we can't
even arrest those thugs?!

28
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:15,161
[FGN MINISTER]
Well, the Bill's still fairly
new.. Naturally,
it's full of loopholes.

29
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,698
[CHIEF]
There's no time for that,
Foreign Minister!

30
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,601
We can't split hairs over
legislation right now!

31
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,303
[FGN MINISTER]
If you want to break the law,
then be my guest...

32
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,106
as long as you don't mind being
arrested for it.

33
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,510
[CHIEF]
(stunned) Don't be ridiculous...

34
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,944
[SMITH]
Don't worry, Chief.

35
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,378
[MINISTER/AGENT/CHIEF]
hm?

36
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:36,082
This is exactly what
my team is here for. (sip)

37
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,684
[SMITH]
Blegh! This coffee's terrible!

38
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,419
[CHIEF]
Focus, will you?!

39
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,387
[MINISTER]
Alright, Smith...

40
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,690
If you believe your Interspecies
Exchange Security Service

41
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,292
can resolve this problem,
then by all means...

42
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:50,030
[CHIEF]
What?! Are you going
to trust THEM?

43
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,297
How will you get in?!

44
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,100
Those Orcs will
sniff you out for sure!

45
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,702
(squeal) Check that out!

46
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,304
This one's so rare, I can't
believe they have it here!

47
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,273
[ORC A]
Hmm... (sniffing)

48
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:01,742
[ORC A]
(annoyed)

49
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,912
[ZOMBINA]
(pain)

50
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:09,750
[ORC A]
Hey, looks like we got
company, boys!

51
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,451
[ORC C]
Whoa, she's like
a cool ninja babe!

52
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,053
[ORC B]
She's pretty cute, huh?

53
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:17,958
[ZOMBINA]
(pained) Agh...
How did you know I was up there?

54
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:22,629
[ORC A]
I could smell you...
We Orcs can smell anything
within over a half‐mile radius,

55
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,031
especially a hot girl
like you...

56
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,634
which is why the police can't
get close enough to stop us.

57
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,069
[POLICEMAN A]
Did you hear those gunshots?

58
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:31,437
[POLICEMAN B]
Yeah, I did.

59
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:34,641
(cough) So you handsome fellas
like my perfume?

60
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,476
[ORC A]
Damn right, we do.

61
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:39,345
[ZOMBINA]
(impact) (gasp)

62
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,481
[ORC A]
I don't like girls
with nasty mouths.

63
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,650
[ZOMBINA]
(extended nervous) (pain)

64
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,786
[ORC A]
Excuse me, is this the police?

65
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:49,189
We just disposed of the female
agent you sent in here.

66
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,724
[ORC A]
But it was all in self‐defense.

67
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:53,927
She violated the Interspecies
Bill by attacking me,

68
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,530
so I had no choice
but to fight back!

69
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,099
[CHIEF]
I didn't give the order
to go in there!

70
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,067
[F. AGENT A]
Then who's the officer?

71
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,837
[CHIEF]
Someone went in without
my authorization!

72
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:04,938
[SMITH]
(smile)

73
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,472
I wish it hadn't come to this...

74
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,809
but we'll have to leave it
up to you now.

75
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:13,346
[SMITH]
It's alright... We've got
everything under control.

76
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:16,116
[ORC D]
Hey, Boss!

[COSPLAY GIRL]
(scared) (startled)

78
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:20,486
Look who I just found hiding
around the corner!

79
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:21,855
[COSPLAY GIRL] No!

00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:25,025

[COSPLAY GIRL]
(scared)

93
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,550
You don't have to be afraid
of us, Mako‐chan.

94
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,884
[COSPLAY GIRL]
(nervous) (protesting gasps)

95
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,553
We're all gentlemen here.

96
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:55,922
We'd never do anything
to hurt a lady.

97
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,492
In fact, we even honor the
Interspecies Exchange Bill.

00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:00,861
[COSPLAY GIRL]
(extended panic)

99
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:05,431
Now... since we're talking
about "exchange"...

100
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:11,004
Let's show the cops how
our organization does
Interspecies Exchange, shall we?

101
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,606
[ORC D]
B‐but Boss! That's not fair!

Eh, alright, we'll take turns!

Perfect... They're all standing
next to the window. And the

105
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,928

I swear I didn't smell anyone...

00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:55,916
Don't tell me they're shooting
from outside the range of our

Finally done... Those guys made

00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:10,496
[MANAKO]
All this wind is really starting
to dry out my eye.

116
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:17,604

me over a mile away!

00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:16,777
[RACHNERA]
Listen. I need you to be quiet.
If you scream for help, then‐

295
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:18,444
[RACHNERA]
(delighted surprised)

296
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:21,682
Oh my... Guess you have
an extra appendage as well.

297
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:24,484
[KIMIHITO]
Ah, omigod!
I don't believe this!

298
00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:27,320
Sorry! I can't help it,
it just happened!

299
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,022
[RACHNERA]
I said be quiet.

300
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,957
[KIMIHITO]
(gagged) (gagged protests)

301
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:34,094
[SATSUKE]
(scared) Wh‐who's there?!

302
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:38,198
[RACHNERA]
Well now...
That was a close call.

303
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:39,633
[KIMIHITO]
(gagged struggle)

304
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:42,102
[RACHNERA]
(notice) (smile)

305
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:45,572
[KIMIHITO]
(fighting a boner)

306
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,874
[RACHNERA]
(snicker)

307
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:50,043
[KIMIHITO]
(startled) (panicking)

308
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:54,781
[RACHNERA]
You actually stayed in one
place... There's a good boy.

309
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,783
[SATSUKE]
I gotta get outta here!

310
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:58,218
It's too creepy!

311
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,922
[RACHNERA]
You know... It may scare you...

312
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,625
but you're only hanging
by your legs and your mouth.
[KIMIHITO] (straining)

313
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:07,260
What do you think would happen
if you fell from up here.

314
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,262
[KIMIHITO]
W‐why are you doing this?

315
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:13,834
[RACHNERA]
Because you've been
a naughty boy.

316
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:15,301
[KIMIHITO]
(gagged shock)

317
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,303
[RACHNERA] (giggle)
[KIMIHITO] (fighting the boner)

318
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:20,440
[RACHNERA]
Here's your punishment.
Are they heavy?

319
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,875
[KIMIHITO]
(straining)

320
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:23,209
[RACHNERA]
Ooh, I'm impressed.

321
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,645
You're quite the little trooper,
aren't you?

322
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:27,848
Trying so hard to fight it...
You're so cute.

323
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:31,918
Now, let's see if you can
handle some more. (bite)

324
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,486
[KIMIHITO]
(straining)

325
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:35,756
[RACHNERA]
(licking)

326
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:40,827
[KIMIHITO]
Aw come on, that's just not
fair! I‐I can't take it!

327
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,830
[KIMIHITO]
(bite) (realize)

328
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,932
[RACHNERA]
(surprised) (amused)

329
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,500
[KIMIHITO]
(scream) (halt)

330
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:49,736
[KIMIHITO]
(cowering)

331
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,071
[RACHNERA]
How about that?

332
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:52,706
You managed to bite
clean through my thread.

333
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:56,577
I guess I wasn't the only one
to do some nibbling.

334
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:59,813
[KIMIHITO]
I was so sure
I was about to die...

335
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,347
like 6 different ways...

336
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,951
[RACHNERA]
I might have overdone it
a little bit... Sorry!

337
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,553
[KIMIHITO]
Hey, uh, Rachnera?

338
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:09,089
What are you running from?
What are you hiding?

339
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:10,423
[RACHNERA]
(huh?)

340
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:12,225
[KIMIHITO]
You're here with me...

341
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:14,460
but you SHOULD be at home
with your host family.

342
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:17,497
[RACHNERA]
Let's just say I didn't see
eye‐to‐eye with my host.

343
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:19,566
[KIMIHITO]
Oh yeah?

344
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:23,336
[RACHNERA]
I'm sure they were expecting
someone soft and sweet.

345
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:28,809
Ah, but the sour expressions on
their faces were so priceless.

346
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,178
One day, they were approached

347
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,516
by a shady‐looking man
offering to take me in.

348
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:39,185
I'm sure that was an easy
decision for them to make.

349
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,421
[KIMIHITO]
That sounds terrible.

350
00:18:41,522 --> 00:18:42,889
[RACHNERA]
(grunt)

351
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,357
[KIMIHITO]
(pinned down)

352
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,259
[RACHNERA]
Just so you know,

353
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,562
I have no interest
in feeding on your sympathy.

354
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:51,197
[RACHNERA]
I'm just fed up with you humans.

355
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,266
Your kind may act
like you want to help...

356
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:58,138
but in the end, you can only
accept people who are like you.
It makes me sick.

357
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:00,206
[KIMIHITO]
(speechless)

358
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,575
[RACHNERA]
And you're no different.

359
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:03,343
Your lower body's only
reacting that way

360
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:06,947
because of the parts of me
that look human.

361
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:11,718
The rest of me only invokes
feelings of fear and disgust.

362
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,388
[KIMIHITO]
No, actually.

363
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,890
[RACHNERA]
(hm?)

364
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,959
[KIMIHITO]
Your legs are, um...

365
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:21,394
how should I put it...

366
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,863
[KIMIHITO]
Well, they're captivating.

367
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:24,330
[RACHNERA]
(surprised)

368
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,466
[KIMIHITO]
(excited)

369
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,001
[RACHNERA]
Aren't you kinky.

370
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,402
[KIMIHITO]
(shocked)

371
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,037
[RACHNERA]
Only a real degenerate

372
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:32,939
would be aroused by
spider legs... Oh my...

373
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,608
[KIMIHITO]
No!

374
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,110
[RACHNERA]
Look at you.. You're such
a horny boy...

375
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,912
Let me guess,
you're a virgin right?

376
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,615
[KIMIHITO]
What? That's crazy!
Whatever gave you that idea?!

377
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:43,750
[RACHNERA/KIMIHITO]
(surprised)

378
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:49,856
[KIMIHITO]
What... What's going on?!

379
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,625
[RACHNERA]
(tch) He must've secretly
called for help...

380
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:54,227
This was all an act
to keep me from moving.

381
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:58,699
[KIMIHITO]
They've got
the building surrounded.

382
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,335
This is Interspecies Exchange
Security Service
Coordinator Smith.

383
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,037
[KIMIHITO]
Huh?

384
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:06,172
[SMITH]
Now listen carefully.

385
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:07,874
We know that you inflicted
violence

386
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,876
upon that
self‐proclaimed director...

387
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:13,580
That behavior is strictly
forbidden by law.

388
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,248
[SMITH]
Surrender peacefully!

389
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:17,417
Otherwise, we'll have to
approach with force.

390
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:19,352
[DOPPEL]
Thanks for the tip, by the way.

391
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,555
[SATSUKE]
Uh... sure thing.

392
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:24,591
[RACHNERA]
I suppose I'll have to use
this hostage to...
(surprised)

393
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:30,230
[KIMIHITO]
I‐I guess I DID punch the guy
in the face but...
that was... because he...

394
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,066
[RACHNERA]
Wait a minute.

395
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,400
[KIMIHITO]
No, the law is the law.

396
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,969
[RACHNERA]
Yes, but...

397
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,303
[KIMIHITO]
Even if he was a scumbag,

398
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,238
I shouldn't have...

399
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:39,405
[RACHNERA]
Oh shut up!

400
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:40,440
Now listen to me!

401
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,275
[KIMIHITO]
(yelp) (pain)

402
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,376
[RACHNERA]
You're getting
ahead of yourself.

403
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,378
[KIMIHITO]
(huh?)

404
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:48,281
Did it not occur to you
that they're talking to me?

405
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:49,916
[KIMIHITO]
You? But why?

406
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:51,417
[RACHNERA]
Well...

407
00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:55,556
[KIMIHITO]
(sigh) Then I'll turn myself in.

408
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:56,890
[RACHNERA]
(surprised)

409
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,925
You should run away, okay?

410
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:02,195
Best of luck to you, Rachnera.

411
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:04,598
[RACHNERA]
(start to laugh)

412
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:06,132
[RACHNERA]
"Good luck", really? (laughing)

413
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:07,568
Oh God. That's good.

414
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:08,835
[KIMIHITO]
Yeah! So! What about it?!

415
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,637
[MON]
(stunned)

416
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:12,172
[RACHNERA]
(laughing) Aren't you so cool?
(laughing)

417
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:13,540
[KIMIHITO]
Stop laughing!

418
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,009
[RACHNERA]
You know, I think I like you...

419
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,177
You're so adorable!

420
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,212
[KIMIHITO]
(speechless)

421
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:21,515
[SMITH]
I'm terribly sorry, Rachnera.

422
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:25,218
We chose the wrong homestay
for you and failed to correct
the situation.

423
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:29,956
[RACHNERA]
Oh, don't bother... I wasn't
looking for some sort of an
apology from you.

424
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:33,393
It was lacking in sincerity
anyway...

425
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:37,130
I mean this IS
a result of YOUR negligence.

426
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,033
[SMITH]
Sincerity... I see.

427
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:43,504
[RACHNERA]
Exactly... I've got nowhere
left to go now.

428
00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:48,008
If only there were a nice
spacious house somewhere...
recently remodeled, perhaps...

429
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:51,578
with several other non‐human
girls already living there
happily.

430
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:54,480
Now that would be
just perfect for me.

431
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:56,149
Oh... and the host must be

432
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:57,884
comfortable around spiders...

433
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:01,121
Otherwise, there'd be no hope
of things working out at all.

434
00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:02,723
[SMITH]
(realize)

435
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:04,257
[RACHNERA] (giggling)
[KIMIHITO] (fretting)

436
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:05,526
I understand...
Though I have to admit..

437
00:22:05,626 --> 00:22:06,860
with those conditions,

438
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,662
your options are going
to be rather limited...

439
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:12,432
But there is one place that
would make a great fit for you.

440
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:13,567
[RACHNERA]

Ladies, you must evacuate
quickly!

443
00:23:31,812 --> 00:23:33,614
Darling may be contaminated.

444
00:23:33,714 --> 00:23:35,315
We have to quarantine him.

445
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,283
If a new virus from a human
mutates

446
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:39,586
and is transmitted
to non‐human species...

447
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:44,758
...then it could lead to a
pandemic that threatens the
existence of all non‐humans!
