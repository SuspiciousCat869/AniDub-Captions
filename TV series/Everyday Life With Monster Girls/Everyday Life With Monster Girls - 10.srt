1
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:40,934
[KIMIHITO]
(happy sigh)Well, This is a nice
change of pace, huh?

2
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,670
At least that's what I'd LIKE to
say.

3
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,041
[KIMIHITO]
Ugh... Why'd you say you wanted
to come here again?

4
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:51,211
[PAPI]
Me?... I never said anything
like that.

5
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,680
[KIMIHITO]
What?! You don't remember?!

6
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,415
[PAPI]
(hmm...)

7
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:57,651
[PAPI]
Uh‐oh...
Now that you say that,

8
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:00,420
I feel
like I forgot something
important...

9
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,388
[ZOMBINA]
This is so good!(gross eating
under)

10
00:02:02,488 --> 00:02:04,591
[KIMIHITO]
What are you doing?!... Stop
chowing down!

11
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,927
You're supposed
to be our bodyguard, aren't
you?!

12
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:08,194
[ZOMBINA]
Man, I love meat!

13
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,362
[KIMIHITO]
This was your idea!

14
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,564
You said if we make it look like

15
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,232
I'm alone with the girls in the
woods,

16
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,034
we might draw out the guy
who wrote the letter!

17
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,403
But he's not gonna come out if
he knows we have you here to
protect us!

18
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:18,939
[ZOMBINA]
It's nothing to freak out about.

19
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,206
[KIMIHITO]
Why not?!

20
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,474
[ZOMBINA]
Oh... by the way, I heard

21
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,109
somebody dumped some industrial
waste

22
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,978
around here somewhere...
Be careful.(gulp)

23
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,346
[KIMIHITO]
Whoa, industrial waste?

24
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:27,981
[ZOMBINA]
What if you get infected by

25
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,483
radioactive sludge and turn into
a zombie?

26
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,318
[KIMIHITO]
Not sure how to respond to
that...

27
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:36,156
[ZOMBINA]
I wonder if your face will melt
off.(laughing)

28
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,825
[ZOMBINA/KIMIHITO]
(surprised)
[PAPI/SUU] (huh?)

29
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:46,366
[KIMIHITO/ZOMBINA]
(staring)

30
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,903
[BIG KII]]
(roar)

31
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,139
[ZOMBINA]
Uhhmm... okay... that's a tree
monster...

32
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,908
[KIMIHITO]
(freaking out)

33
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,245
[BIG KII]]
(rage)

34
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,150
[KIMIHITO]
(panicking)

35
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,485
[KIMIHITO]
Can somebody please tell me what

36
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,487
that crazy thing is, 'cause it's
a WHOLE LOT

37
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:08,889
more terrifying than
a zombie!

38
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,891
Is that another non‐human
species

39
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,159
or just a nuked‐out
tree?!

40
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,761
[PAPI]
(gasp)Kii!

41
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,431
[BIG KII]
Papi... Papi!

42
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,300
[PAPI]
(panic)(grabbed)

43
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,869
[PAPI]
I REMEMBER NOW!

44
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,337
[KIMIHITO]
PAPIIIII!(running)

45
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,073
[SUU]
(gasp)
[KIMIHITO] (fumble)(dig heels
in)

46
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:30,176
[SUU]
(groan)Ah.. Master...?

47
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:33,179
[KIMIHITO]
Run away, Suu!

48
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,015
You have to go let Smith know
what's going on!

49
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,617
[SUU]
But...

50
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,085
[KIMIHITO]
OH GOD IT'S DIGGING INTO MY
CROTCH AAAAAAAAH!

51
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,287
[SUU]
Master!(huh?)

52
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:46,760
[SUU]
(squeal)(bounce x3)

53
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:57,403
[KII]
Stand down... human... I will
not allow you to harm me.

54
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,373
I am a Dryad... Keeper of plants

55
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,509
and protector of the forest.

56
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,911
And I despise you human beings.

57
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,947
[KIMIHITO]
(surprised)A Dryad?

58
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:08,114
[KIMIHITO]
That can't be right...

59
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,883
They're in the
book Smith gave me

60
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,384
but they're
not this massive.

61
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,119
[KIMIHITO]
(pain)

62
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,321
[PAPI]
No!... Don't do it, Kii!...

63
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,924
Please don't hurt my master!...
Stop!

64
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,526
[KII]
Papi...

65
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,529
[KIMIHITO]
(struggling)(huh?)

66
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,365
[PAPI]
Guess Kii's mad... You okay?

67
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:29,102
[KIMIHITO]
Huh?... Kii?... Are you telling
me you two know each other?

68
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:33,006
[PAPI]
She's my friend... I forgot
about her for a long time.

69
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:38,178
One day I was out flying around
and I saw Smith ince‐ I mean,

70
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,881
arresting somebody for
kidnapping a non‐human.

71
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:44,284
That's when I saw Kii, all alone
and scared.

72
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,952
[KIMIHITO]
Why'd you call her Kii?

73
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,187
[PAPI]
Rhymes with tree.

74
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,354
[KIMIHITO]
Wow, clever...
[KII](huh?)

75
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,724
[PAPI](Under)
(look)(smile)

76
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:53,827
[PAPI]
She was weak and her roots were
all dried out...

77
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:56,362
so I decided to
plant her here in the woods.

78
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,331
[PAPI](Under)
(giggle)(smile)

79
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,935
[PAPI]
Gotta go!... Bye!... I'll be
back soon!

80
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,605
[KII]
Papi...

81
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,840
[KIMIHITO]
So, how did she get so big?

82
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,710
[PAPI]
Beats me, I forgot all about her
after that!

83
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,079
[KIMIHITO]
What is wrong with you?!

84
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,381
[PAPI]
Kii!.. I promise my master isn't

85
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,417
a bad person!... Let him go,
okay?

86
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,152
[KII]
Papi...
[PAPI] (huh?)

87
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,022
[KII]
Humans are the ones who brought
me to this place...

88
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:25,358
You may be
my friend... but I still hate
humans!

89
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,661
[KIMIHITO]
(scream)
[PAPI] Don't hurt him

90
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,565
[KIMIHITO]
Wait a minute... "Dryad" starts
with D!

91
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,199
Maybe she sent me that
death threat!

92
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:36,102
[PAPI]
(straining)Stop this, Kii!

93
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:37,403
[PAPI]
(slapped)

94
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,273
[KIMIHITO]
Stay back, Papi!

95
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,509
[PAPI]
But this whole thing is all my
fault!

96
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:46,112
If hadn't forgotten about her...
she wouldn't be so angry!

97
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:50,016
That means I have to be the one
to stop her!(slapped)

98
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,886
[KIMIHITO]
Papi!

99
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,890
[PAPI]
(impact)(confused)

100
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:16,910
[KIMIHITO]
S‐Suu?! Now you're a big scary
giant too?!

101
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,785
[KIMIHITO]
(scream)

102
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,155
[SUU]
Master!... I believe Kii
ingested some of those toxic

103
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:33,660
nutrients... It's just a guess,
but that could be the reason for
her extreme increase in size.

104
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,761
[KIMIHITO]
Good guess...

105
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,329
[SUU]
If we can extract those

106
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,497
nutrients from her body,

107
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,199
it should be enough to stabilize
her.

108
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:42,135
[KIMIHITO]
So getting bigger made you
smarter too, huh?

109
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,473
[SUU]
(dodge)(punch)

110
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,580
[PAPI/KIMIHITO]
(hanging on)

111
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,949
[KIMIHITO]
How are we supposed to get that
stuff out of her?!

112
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:59,119
[PAPI]
Ugh... all this bouncing is
making me queasy...

113
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,322
[KIMIHITO/PAPI]
(bounce off)(scream)

114
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,725
[PAPI]
(falling)
[KII] (gasp)

115
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:11,565
[PAPI]
(mmmff...)Okay, let's see...
will this work?

116
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,567
[KII]
(startled)
[PAPI] (suckling)

117
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,471
[KIMIHITO]
Okay, that's a weird method...

118
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,941
but it looks like it's gonna
work at least!

119
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,647
[PAPI]
(gasp)(smooch exert x2)

120
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:29,516
[PAPI]
Aw darn it, I can't quite reach
her!

121
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,218
Hey!... You'll have to take over
from here!

122
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,486
[KIMIHITO]
(shocked)

123
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:36,523
[PAPI]
(yelp)
Hurry!... I can't move,

124
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,125
and this
is kind of a bad position!

125
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,326
[SUU]
Master!

126
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,828
[KIMIHITO]
Uh, do I really have to?!

127
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,698
[PAPI]
Please, we need you!... Only you
can save her!

128
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,900
[KIMIHITO]
But‐!
[SUU] Quickly!... I can only

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,069
keep her restrained for a little
longer!

130
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,336
[KII/KIMIHITO]
(shy)

131
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:53,607
[KIMIHITO]
(determined)(reach)

132
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:01,081
[KIMIHITO]
(tongue‐out reach)(sucking)

133
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:05,151
[KII]
(moaning)(determined)

134
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,821
[SUU]
(huh? x2)(straining)

135
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:15,128
[ZOMBINA]
Jeez, I thought I was double
dead! I sure hope they're okay.

136
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,565
[ZOMBINA]
WHAT THE HELL?!
[KII/PAPI/SUU] (sex noises)

137
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,534
[PAPI]
Let me go...
[SUU] That's enough;

138
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:21,935
you're sucking me
dry...

139
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,269
[KII]
N‐no more...

140
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,739
[ZOMBINA]
(huh?)

141
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,646
[SMITH]
Well, that was quite an ordeal!

142
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:35,115
But it could have been worse.
Luckily there was no chance

143
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:38,451
of casualties out here in the
middle of the sticks anyway.

144
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:41,187
[SMITH]
Now then... This must be the
girl.

145
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,589
[PAPI/SUU]
(startled)

146
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,090
[KIMIHITO]
Wait a second!
[SMITH] (huh?)

147
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,593
[KIMIHITO]
It wasn't her fault... This all
happened

148
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,729
because of that illegal
waste, didn't it?

149
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,731
I think you
should punish the people who
dumped it,

150
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:53,567
not her!... She
couldn't help what she did!

151
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:57,538
[SMITH]
Oh, don't be so dramatic... I
have no intention to punish her.

152
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,139
[KIMIHITO]
(confused)

153
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,306
[SMITH]
She obviously wasn't

154
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,542
the person
who sent you that letter

155
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:02,609
[KIMIHITO]
(huh?)

156
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,444
[SMITH]
I saw her paperwork.

157
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:05,411
She can't write.

158
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:06,412
[KIMIHITO]
Ohhhh...

159
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:07,981
[SMITH]
Starting today,

160
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:10,316
Kii will live
here in this forest...

161
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:14,254
Don't worry, we'll take
care of that garbage that made
you mutate, okay?

162
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,488
[KII]
Thanks.

163
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:16,857
[SMITH]
Of course if you'd rather just

164
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,458
go back to your homeland, I'm
sure

165
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,426
we can arrange that...
How's that sound?

166
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,362
[PAPI/KII/SUU]
(listening)

167
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:25,298
[KII]
As long as Papi and Suu can come
and play with me,

168
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,533
I don't mind
staying here.

169
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:27,868
[PAPI]
(happy)
[SUU] (stare)

170
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,970
[KII]
But that guy doesn't have to
come.

171
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,004
[KIMIHITO]
Me?!

172
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,607
[SMITH]
What did you do?, Out with it.

173
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:34,608
[KIMIHITO]
(awkward)

174
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:35,576
[KII]
On the other hand,

175
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:36,710
you guys seem to really

176
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,211
like that human for some
reason...

177
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,780
[KIMIHITO]
But I didn't really have a
choice,

178
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,747
I mean, she was gonna...

179
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:41,982
What makes him so special?

180
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,350
[PAPI/SUU]
Um...
... because he's nice!

181
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,052
[KII]
That's true, I guess the way he

182
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,154
sucked on my boobs was nice and
gentle...

183
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,592
[KIMIHITO]Did you really have
to bring that up?!

184
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,694
[SMITH]
Wow, Darling, you disgust
me sometimes.

185
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:54,961
[KIMIHITO](Under)
Look, it's not what you think,
okay?

186
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,229
[ZOMBINA]
Always wondered what it'd be

187
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,164
like to be buried alive alive!

188
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,902
Well, except I'm dead...get me
outta here!

189
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,342
[CEREA]
Master, it's dangerous to walk

190
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,846
on the street side. Please stay
to my left if you don't mind.

191
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,114
[KIMIHITO]
Uh‐huh...

192
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,017
[GAL 10A]
Would you like to donate?

193
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,719
[CEREA]
I'll contribute something,

194
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,186
just stay
away from my Master!

195
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,522
[GAL 10A/GAL 10B]
(amazed)

196
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,123
[SHADY GUY 10A]
Hey buddy, you got a minute?

197
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,526
We've got the best girls in
town, you know‐(startled)

198
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,393
[CEREA]
He's not interested!

199
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:28,895
[KIMIHITO]
Hey!
(notice)

200
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:34,134
[CEREA]
Wait, Master, it could be
another threat. Allow me.

201
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,606
[CEREA] Who's there?!
[MANAKO]
(startled)Th‐this is Manako,

202
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,274
I'm the surveillance agent.

203
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,809
I'm watching you two from on top

204
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:43,944
of a tall building, and um...

205
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,712
[CEREA]
Do you see danger?!

206
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,213
[MANAKO]
Well, it's nothing dangerous

207
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,416
exactly... But.. I should bring
it to your attention‐

208
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:55,021
[CEREA]
What?! Is there an enemy?! I'll
strike it down immediately!

209
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,591
[MANAKO]
It's just, you're supposed to be
staging a date to draw out the

210
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:02,395
culprit... but... that armor
you're wearing doesn't really
scream "romantic outing"...

211
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,830
[CEREA]
Don't be absurd!

212
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,898
We still don't know anything

213
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,833
about this "D" character!

214
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:09,603
I HAVE to be in full armor to
keep Master safe!

215
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:13,206
For all we know, the letter "D"
could stand for Dastardly Devil
of Death!

216
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,875
[MANAKO]
I don't think an evil overlord

217
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:16,342
like that would hang out in
Japan... (shriek)

218
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,211
[CEREA]
It's just an example!

219
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:22,415
And besides, I'm PROUD to go out
in full armor!

220
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:23,850
[KIMIHITO]
Um... okay but..

221
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,619
at least
take off your helmet.

222
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:28,221
I think it's making some people
concerned.

223
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:33,527
[CEREA]
I can't decline a request from
my Master... Still!

224
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:35,862
For as long as I am by your side
today,

225
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,264
I swear to you, I will
never allow

226
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,234
anyone to harm a
single hair upon your noble
head!

227
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,469
[KIMIHITO]
Wow, what's got Cerea so fired
up?

228
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,742
I mean, she always talks
like that, but today she seems
especially... intense.

229
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,877
[MANAKO]
I sure hope this works...

230
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,913
[LILITH]
Hey, there.
[MANAKO] (shriek)

231
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:54,881
[LILITH]
What are you doing up on the

232
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:56,650
roof all by yourself, lady?

233
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,352
[LILITH]
Whoa, you're packing heat!

234
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:03,657
[MANAKO]
H‐hello there... What brings you
up here, young la‐ (OM gasp)

235
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,425
[MANAKO/LILITH]
(shriek)

236
00:12:05,526 --> 00:12:07,393
[LILITH]
One‐eyed monster!

237
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:12,799
[MANAKO]
Children are always afraid of
me.

238
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,368
There's no place for
monoeyes in this world.

239
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:22,142
[LILITH]
Other non‐humans are so easy to
play with.

240
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,978
I can't have her getting in the
way of my playdate

241
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,081
with my favorite
goofy Centaur, now can I?
(giggle)

242
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,316
'Cause For Lilith the adorable
Devil girl..

243
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,054
humans and
non‐humans alike are nothing but
helpless playthings!

244
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:38,124
Now then, what kind of game
should we play together first?

245
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,928
[CEREA]
(exert)(extended struggle)

246
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,430
[KIMIHITO]
(panic)Don't hurt yourself,
okay?!

247
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:47,934
[CEREA]
I must!... I can't leave you
unsupervised, Master!

248
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,804
[KIMIHITO]
Uh... Let's just do outdoor
stuff then.

249
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:54,240
[CEREA]
(awkward)I'm so sorry...

250
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,777
[KIMIHITO/SALESGIRL10A
(stunned)

251
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:59,980
[CEREA]
Ah!... How terrible!(fretting)

252
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,848
[KIMIHITO]
Cerea! You okay?

253
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:05,051
[CEREA] I‐I'm fine!(wince)
[KIMIHITO] (knocked aside)

254
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,389
[KIMIHITO]
Balls

255

(running)(sigh)

256
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,962
POLT
(pant x2)Ahhh...

257
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,300
[CEREA]
I apologize for earlier.

258
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,836
[KIMIHITO]
Eh, don't mention it... Anyway,

259
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:25,972
I'm getting hungry now... Did
you say you made lunch?

260
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:29,009
[CEREA]
It's nothing special, but I did
prepare something.

261
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,778
[KIMIHITO]
Wow, that looks great!

262
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:34,447
[CEREA]
Ooh..umm..well. You always cook
for me,

263
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:37,050
so I thought I'd make
something to show my thanks,

264
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,819
despite not being much of a
cook.

265
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,755
[KIMIHITO]
Oh, they're tuna sandwiches.

266
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:44,825
Alright, let's dig in! (chewing)

267
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,760
[CEREA]
I hope they taste good...

268
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,096
I don't use bizarre ingredients
like Miia does.

269
00:13:51,532 --> 00:13:53,199
[CEREA]
How is it, Master?

270
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,602
[KIMIHITO]
Oh! Uhhh, it's pretty good!

271
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:59,072
[KIMIHITO]
I.. It has kind of a subtle
flavor to it...

272
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,741
I bet they're good for you!

273
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:02,342
[CEREA]
Y‐yes they are! I try to be

274
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:05,111
conscious about what I eat, so
I'm glad you like them!

275
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,848
[RACHNELA]
My, Centorea... Did you taste
them?

276
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:10,917
[CEREA] You!
[KIMIHITO] Rachne... Why are you
here?

277
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,219
[RACHNELA]
These don't taste like anything,
dear.

278
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:16,089
[CEREA]
(gasp)
[KIMIHITO] (awkward)

279
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,792
[RACHNELA]
Honey was just trying not to
hurt your feelings.

280
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:19,760
[CEREA]
Is that true?

281
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,394
[KIMIHITO]
N‐no! Uh...

282
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:24,130
I‐I don't think it
tastes BAD or anything.

283
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,232
[RACHNELA]
If you enjoy eating paper bags.

284
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,835
[CEREA]
Well... You see, Centaurs can
only eat vegetables,

285
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:32,873
so... I‐I
couldn't sample the whole
sandwich before serving it.

286
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34,140
[CEREA]
I failed.

287
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,876
[RACHNELA]
Here, have some salt.

288
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:38,144
[KIMIHITO]
Why do you have that?

289
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,083
[CEREA]
I'm sorry, I need to go clear my
head.

290
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,351
[KIMIHITO/RACHNELA]
(concerned)

291
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:50,657
[CEREA]
(troubled)(sigh)

292
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,726
[LILITH]
Hey! Pony girl!

293
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:53,927
[CEREA]
(surprised)

294
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,562
[LILITH]
You're one of those Centaur

295
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:58,264
things, aren't you? So what
are you up to out here?

296
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:02,168
[CEREA]
To tell the truth... I don't
know what I'm doing. (sad)

297
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:05,271
I simply wanted to repay my
Master for everything he does

298
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,307
for me, but all I can do is ruin
everything I touch.

299
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,210
No matter what I do, I'm useless
to him...

300
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,313
I'm not worthy to
stand by his side.

301
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,482
Oh.. I'm so sorry, that was
inappropriate...

302
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,485
Just forget
it... I was‐(surprised, into
gasp)

303
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:23,824
[CEREA] (confused)
[LILITH] I'm sure that's not
true?

304
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,192
[LILITH]
Think about it a little harder..

305
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:30,096
I'm sure there's SOMETHING you
can do to make your master
happy,

306
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:33,066
isn't there, my little
horsey friend?

307
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,169
[KIMIHITO]
Cerea? Hey!

308
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,139
Where did you disappear
to?(notice)

309
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:44,978
There you are. Uh... what's
wrong?

310
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:50,517
That hurt... What's up with you?

311
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,019
Uh... please say something.

312
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,622
[KIMIHITO]
(freak out)(stammering
under)

313
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:59,192
[CEREA]
I've heard that human males
prefer females with larger

314
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,596
breasts, so I thought you might
take pleasure in fondling mine.‐

315
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:05,498
Though I hope they aren't TOO
large for you, Master...

316
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:07,333
[KIMIHITO]
Ah!.. Well I mean, no, they're
not too big,

317
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,235
but that's not
really the problem here!

318
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,372
[CEREA]
Right, I apologize...

319
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:16,142
I shouldn't have withheld myself
from you...

320
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,344
Forgive me;
I was too proper.

321
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,916
[KIMIHITO]
This is like seven different
kinds of problematic

322
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,151
I‐I can't get away!

323
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,556
[CEREA]
Yes, that's it, Master...

324
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,158
Touch my body
in any manner you please.

325
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:33,894
[KIMIHITO]
(freak out)

326
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,462
[CEREA]
(panting)

327
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:40,100
[KIMIHITO]
Uh‐oh, they're so soft, I'm
starting to lose

328
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:45,271
consciousness... My hands are
moving on their own now!

329
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,108
[LILITH]
(giggle)
What a riot!...

330
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,678
I only hypnotized
her a little bit, and now she's
throwing herself at him!

331
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:55,782
(giggle)
Oh man, I bet they'll go all the
way right here in the park!

332
00:16:55,882 --> 00:17:00,153
(hm?)
Hey, who's back there?... Don't
be so loud!

333
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:03,056
If they see me‐(stunned)

334
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,326
[LILITH]
(shriek)

335
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:07,894
[KIMIHITO]
(OM dazed sit up)

336
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,262
[CEREA/KIMIHITO]
(huh?)(OM startled)

337
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,431
BOAR(Under)
(running)

338
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:14,935
[LILITH]
W‐why would there be a wild boar
in a place like this?!

339
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:18,204
[KIMIHITO]
Hey, you big pig!... Slow down!

340
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,807
BOAR
(running)(OM enraged)

341
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,576
BOAR
(impact)

342
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,782
[KIMIHITO]
Sorry, pal...

343
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,226
BOAR
(angry)

344
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,028
[KIMIHITO]
(huh?)

345
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,830
BOAR
(preparing)(charge)

346
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,366
[KIMIHITO]
Dammit, now it's after ME!

347
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,205
POLT
(running)

348
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:58,278
[KIMIHITO]
Whooooaaa!... You were awesome
back there, Cerea!...

349
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,614
Thank you.. You saved me.

350
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:03,650
[CEREA]
There's nothing to be impressed
about.

351
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,152
[KIMIHITO] You don't have to be
so humble about it
[CEREA] Yes I do!

352
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,955
[CEREA]
Master... all I want is to be of

353
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:12,926
use to you but... I'm
constantly causing you more
trouble.

354
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:16,697
The only time I can aid you is
when I'm cleaning up a mess that
I made.

355
00:18:16,797 --> 00:18:20,500
I'm just not worthy to stand by
your side and call myself your
servant

356
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:25,939
but I want you to be
able to depend on me... no
matter what you may need.

357
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,775
I'm so sorry I failed you,
Master.

358
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:41,487
[KIMIHITO] Okay.
[CEREA]
(surprised)W... what are you...?

359
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:44,357
[KIMIHITO]
Well, it turns out I was so
surprised by that boar

360
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:48,529
that I twisted my ankle... I
hate to bug you, but could you
give me a ride home?

361
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:51,632
[CEREA]
Mmm... well um... I could...
it's just...

362
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:55,268
I told you... I'm only useful
when I've already inconvenienced
you...

363
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,771
[KIMIHITO]
That's not true.
[CEREA] (panic)

364
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:03,544
[KIMIHITO]
I count on you more than you
know... All the time.

365
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:05,679
[CEREA]
Oh, Master...

366
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,515
[SATSUKE]
Hey, uh, we got a call about a

367
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,684
loose animal around
here...(surprised)

368
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:14,154
[SATSUKE]
What the hell?! Why is this...

369
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,322
[RACHNELA]
Let's see now... Whatever am I

370
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:20,861
to do with you, my sweet
little... what was it?...
Lilith?

371
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:25,532
[RACHNELA]
I can't let you go in case
you're the culprit

372
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:28,468
Oh dear,
you seem frightened!... How
adorable.

373
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:30,370
[LILITH]
Oh, you think I'm scared?...

374
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,273
Kinda seems like you're the one
who's scared around here.

375
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,576
You act like some kind of tough
black widow chick

376
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,844
who's got
everybody wrapped up in your
web...

377
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:42,983
But the truth is, you're too
afraid to open up and show
people who you really are.

378
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,718
Sure you can act like you don't
care,

379
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:48,488
but you really just can't
handle rejection. That sound
about right

380
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:51,324
You're worried about what
humans are gonna think when they

381
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:54,861
see that creepy spider bottom
half of yours... aren't you?

382
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:57,397
All those eyes and you
can't see that you're the one

383
00:19:57,497 --> 00:20:01,702
tangled up in a web of fear
(giggle)(surprised)

384
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:03,937
[RACHNELA]
Oh I see.

385
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,607
At first glance I thought you
were nothing but a loud‐mouthed

386
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:09,275
child... but you're a grown
woman.

387
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,811
[LILITH]
(scared)

388
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:12,345
[RACHNELA]
So that means I can give you an

389
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:16,617
adult punishment,
right?(laughs)(lick lips)

390
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:20,353
[LILITH]
(scream)

391
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:26,827
[CEREA]
I've found a way to reduce
Master's responsibilities.

392
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:30,731
Starting today, I'll be in
charge of preparing salad.

393
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:35,068
I want you all to clean your
plates, and don't be picky.

394
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:37,704
[MIIA]
Hey, not everybody's a herbivore
in this house, you know!

395
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:40,741
[PAPI]
Yeah, this is boring! I want some
meat! Come on!

396
00:20:40,841 --> 00:20:43,744
[CEREA]
Don't bother!... I will be as
strict as the Master was

397
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:46,513
generous.. From this day
forward, you won't get a scrap

398
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:49,282
of meat until you finish every
bite of your vegetables!

399
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:50,684
[PAPI/MIIA]
No fair!

400
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:52,385
[MERO]
Well, I don't mind the change;

401
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:53,554
salads are quite healthy!

402
00:20:53,654 --> 00:20:55,288
[KIMIHITO]
Thank you, Cerea... I can

403
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:58,559
never
get these ladies to eat their
vegetables.

404
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:01,061
[CEREA]
No... this is the least I can
do.

405
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:04,631
I always carried the weight of
the world on my shoulders.

406
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:08,268
I didn't want to accept that
there are some things I can't
handle.

407
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:10,604
[CEREA]
Therefore... from now on, I

408
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:13,439
promise to do whatever I CAN
do to the fullest!

409
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:19,112
Thank you, strange girl! Though
I can't quite remember all of
what you said...

410
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:22,282
[LILITH]
There's SOMETHING you can do...

411
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:24,484
[CEREA]
And in return.. I‐I'll ask for

412
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:28,054
help whenever I need it, Master.
Is that alright with you?

413
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:30,857
[KIMIHITO]
Sure thing. Anytime you want.

414
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:34,360
[CEREA]
(happy)(smile)

415
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:38,298
[LILITH]
(sexy panting)

416
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:41,067
[RACHNELA]
So then... you're not "D" after
all...

417
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:45,171
Tell me, little imp... is
there anything else you're
hiding?...

418
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:47,240
Or perhaps you've
been lying to me?

419
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,308
[LILITH]
Oh no, mistress, I wouldn't
dream of

420
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:50,343
keeping anything from
you!

421
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:52,378
So could you please let
me have my reward now?!

422
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,214
[RACHNELA]
(chuckle)
[LILITH] (pleasured squeal)

423
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,316
[CEREA]
What do you think you're
doing?!...

424
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,884
You have to eat it
yourselves!

425
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,753
[PAPI]
Finish every bite!

426
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:32,245
[ZOMBINA]
Oh, by the way......

427
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:34,214
you're going on a hot
date with us today.

428
00:23:34,314 --> 00:23:35,348
[KIMIHITO]
Huh?

429
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:36,650
[ZOMBINA]
Check this out.

430
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,685
[KIMIHITO]
Oh great, another creepy letter.

431
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:43,624
[LALA]
It's you. You're going to die...
very soon.
