00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:42,703
[Women]
Welcome home, Master!
It's great to see you!

2
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,106
(cafe chatter)

3
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,643
[SMITH]
Darling!

4
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:53,514
[KIMIHITO]
Uh, hey Smith. Why are we
meeting at a maid cafe?

5
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,783
[SMITH]
Why not? I've always wanted to
check these things out.

6
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,084
[KIMIHITO]
Uh‐huh...

7
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,453
[SMITH]
Aw, what's wrong?... Not a fan?

8
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:03,489
[KIMIHITO] (surprised)
N‐no... it's okay.
[SMITH] (giggle)

9
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,826
MAID 9A
Just let me know when you're
ready to order, okay, Master?

10
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:08,629
[SMITH]
Excuse me, miss, could we get
two coffees over here?

11
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,098
[SATSUKE]
Ahhh... I'm so glad I'm finally
off duty today‐

12
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,366
[MIIA]
(fuming)

13
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,036
[SATSUKE]
(startled)
Not again!

14
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,138
[MIIA]
Is he on a date with Smith?!

15
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:19,506
How dare he cheat on me?!

16
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,342
[CEREA]
We can't tell anything for
certain yet.

17
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,477
[MERO]
We need to go in and find out
for ourselves.

18
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,412
That's the only
way to be sure.

19
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:27,781
[CEREA]
Yes, you're right... but I think

20
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,416
it's fair to say none of us
exactly blend in.

21
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,653
[MIIA]
What if we wore disguises?

22
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,655
[CEREA]
We don't have anything on hand.

23
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,557
Then again I suppose Suu

24
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,859
is kind
of a walking disguise.

25
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,295
[MIIA/MERO/CEREA]
(realize)
[PAPI] (huh?)

26
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:45,532
[SMITH]
Ugh, great... This is cheap
instant coffee.

27
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,768
[KIMIHITO]
I'm sure, but maybe you
shouldn't say it so loud.

28
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:50,070
MAN 9A/MAN 9B
Whoaaaa!(OM goofy mesmerized,
laughing)

29
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,872
[MERO]
Thank you for your order,

30
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,707
Masters, I'll bring that right
out.

31
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:58,111
[MERO]
It'll just be a moment.

32
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,145
[KIMIHITO]
Mero?

33
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,914
[MERO]
Oh? Is there a maid

34
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,448
you'd
like to request?

35
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,985
[KIMIHITO]
Uh... no... Sorry...

36
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,286
I thought
you were, uh...

37
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,889
[SMITH]
Oh, don't be ridiculous,
Darling.

38
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,524
Mero has a fish tail.

39
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,559
[KIMIHITO]
Yeah... I just thought it might
be...

40
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,729
[SMITH]
Under the dress?(laugh)

41
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,099
[MERO]
I succeeded!... They didn't
find me out.

42
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,333
[CEREA]
Hey!.. Quiet!

43
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,334
[MIIA]
Keep your voice down

44
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,368
or they
might catch you!

45
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,304
[CEREA]
(troubled)Anyway,

46
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,471
I think it's
going well so far.

47
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,040
[MIIA]
This would probably be a lot

48
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,510
more effective if we let Suu
take over.

49
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,478
Okay, Mero, see if you can get

50
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,347
some incriminating evidence on
those two!

51
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:38,418
[MERO]
I'll see what I can
do.(startled, into trip)

52
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,989
[MAN 9C]
(startled)(Foley)Careful!...
Watch where you're‐

53
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,291
[MERO]
Oh dear... I hope you'll excuse

54
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,760
my clumsiness, Master...

55
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,329
[MAN 9C]
Eheheh... sure thing,
baby.

56
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,297
[MIIA]
Uh, Mero? You can drop the maid
act now.

57
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,667
[MERO]
But I've already got a
backstory!

58
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,703
A noble stripped of her title...
who disguises herself as a

59
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,706
housemaid just so she can be
closer to her forbidden love!

60
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,075
[MIIA]
That's not what we're here for,
tragedy addict!

61
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:06,279
[MERO]
Tragedy addict?... Well, you
don't have to be so harsh..

62
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,248
[MIIA]
just keep a close eye on
Darling, alright?!

63
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,484
[SMITH]
That was nice. Perfect start for
our date... What's next?

64
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,219
[MERO]
(shocked) It IS a date!

65
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,454
[SMITH](Under)
I'm open to suggestions...

66
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:15,756
[MERO]
N‐no, perhaps Miss Smith is just

67
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:19,492
forcing him to go with her. Yes,
of course!

68
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,461
[KIMIHITO]
Uh, you're making me kinda
nervous.

69
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:23,363
[MERO]
He's not objecting to it!

70
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,466
[MIIA] Mero? What's going on?
[SMITH] Don't worry, I'll show
you what to do.

71
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,001
[MERO]
Well, actually...

72
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,804

[MERO]
(bothered noises)( panting)

76
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,913
[MERO]
Oh, it's my sweat!... I forgot,

77
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:43,483
when Suu gets dehydrated, she'll
attack anything for water!

78
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:49,590
This isn't good... If I make too
much noise, the master will
surely hear me!

79
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,928
Oh? I'm not sweating anymore,
now it's just...

80

ah.. ah.. aaaahhhh!

Yeah, pick up your copy today!

It must be some kind of costume
party.

90
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:28,094
[KIMIHITO]
It's an event for a new game, I
think. (hm?)

91
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,933
[SMITH]
Hey Darling... Mind if we stop
in here for a sec?

00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:35,602
I'll show you how great I am at
crane games.

Hmm...She's got hands and big

they're onto us though.

Exactly... So we decided to
stage a date, thinking that

199
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,730
might help lure out the
culprit... I guess they weren't
convinced.

Just the two of us!

did Mero have to come with us
again?

288
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:49,783
[DRACO]
(gyaaah!)(frantic fixing)

289
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:53,186
[MIIA]
I'm so sorry! Huh? A tail?

290
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,556
[DRACO]
No, it's okay... Oh.

291
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:59,259
It's rare to see a non‐human
girl...

292
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:02,763
I'm sorry. I guess I was
a little distracted.

293
00:16:02,863 --> 00:16:06,733
[MIIA]
I wonder what species he is. A
Lizardman maybe?

294
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,001
[DRACO]
It's cold in here.

295
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,203
My body temperature's kinda
low...

296
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,138
That must be why I'm so
out of it today.

297
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,940
[MIIA]
Yeah, I know what you mean!

298
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,310
Whenever the AC's on, I feel
like I could start hibernating
right there!

299
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,113
[DRACO]
I can't even go to the frozen
section at the grocery store.

300
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,648
[MIIA]
Me neither!

301
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:24,985
[DRACO]
Oh... here, take this. It'll
help warm you up.

302
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:27,220
[MIIA]
(surprised)
Wow, thank you.

303
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,056
[DRACO]
You seemed pretty upset.
Everything okay?

304
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,424
[MIIA]
Yeah.. I'm fine.

305
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:33,560
[DRACO]
Man... they keep this place so
cold.

306
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,062
You want to go out in
the sun for a while?

307
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,932
[MIIA]
Uh, sure.

308
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:41,201
[TIO]
Yeah, Miia just walked off with
some good‐looking guy...

309
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,503
WOMAN 9B(Under)
Ma'am? I'm sorry but you

310
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:44,170
[TIO]
Do you think I should follow
them?

311
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,206
I don't know, isn't it
more important to make sure

312
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,141
Darling doesn't get left alone
while the culprit's on the
loose?

313
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,677
[WOMAN 9B]
It'll die. Please give it back
[TIO] Besides, I'm having fun.

314
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:53,714
[SMITH]
It's possible Darling's not the
one they're after.

315
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:57,684
[TIO] Huh?
[SMITH] It could be he's got his
eye on those girls...

316
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:01,121
He probably sees
Darling as competition for their
love.

317
00:17:01,622 --> 00:17:03,189
[TIO]
Uh‐oh...

318
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,728
[MIIA]
The wind's a little chilly
today.

319
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:10,230
[DRACO]
Take my jacket.

320
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,165
[MIIA]
Oh, thanks a lot.

321
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,434
[DRACO]
I can't believe what a jerk that
guy is.

322
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:18,038
He should know better than to
bring another girl on a date
with you.

323
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,774
[MIIA]
(surprised)
No, Darling's not a jerk at all.

324
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,544
[DRACO] (hm?)
[MIIA]
He's a really sweet person;

325
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:25,946
he just wants
to take good care of ALL of us.

326
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,447
[DRACO]
But if he really cared about
you,

327
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:29,449
why would he leave you
alone like that?

328
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,552
[MIIA]
No, Mero's the one to blame
here!

329
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:35,055
She said she wanted to
help me out, but all she did was
show off!

330
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,489
[MIIA]
But Darling's so nice.

331
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,125
He didn't want to abandon
someone who needed him.

332
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,261
That's
one of the things I love about
him.

333
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,764
[DRACO]
(annoyed)Stop talking about
that scumbag!

334
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:45,065
[MIIA]
W‐what?!

335
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,900
[DRACO]
What's
so great about that loser?

336
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,070
He has
everything he could ever want
and he doesn't even care!

337
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,173
[MIIA] Don't yell...
[DRACO] I think you should be
with me instead.

338
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:54,541
[MIIA]
Umm huh?

339
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:56,977
[DRACO]
We have a lot more in
common anyway.

340
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,245
I think we would
be great together.

341
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:03,617
As for your friend... it'll be
easy to get him out of the way.

342
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:06,587
[MIIA] (gasp)
[DRACO]
Who better to understand you

343
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:08,488
than someone of your own kind
right?

344
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,624
[MIIA]
Wait a second, Lamias and
Lizardmen

345
00:18:10,724 --> 00:18:12,659
are kind of similar,
but I don't know if‐

346
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:17,097
[DRACO]
You think I'm a Lizardman? No,
I'm something much better!

347
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:19,365
[MIIA]
(gasp)

348
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,934
[DRACO]
I'm the greatest...

349
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:23,670
no...... I'm
the KING of all species!

350
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:28,942
A proud royal descendant of
the dragons themselves...Bow
before Draco the Dragonewt!

351
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:34,147
[MIIA]
Dragonewt... D! He must be the
one who send that letter!

352
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,182
[DRACO]
Now just be still and do
everything I say!

353
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,219
[MIIA]
(gasp)(shoved)

354
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:42,723
[DRACO]
I've been watching you, you
know.

355
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:44,124
[MIIA](Under)
(trembling)

356
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:48,194
[DRACO]
And now...I can finally make you
mine.

357
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:52,265
[MIIA]
Darling... please, I need you!

358
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,467
[DRACO]
(gasp)

359
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,904
[DRACO]
Huh?... Who's there?!

360
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,272
[MIIA]
(muffled surprised)

361
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:05,011
[KIMIHITO]
(battle cry)GET AWAY FROM
MIIAAAA!

362
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,613
[MIIA]
It's Darling!

363
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,414
[DRACO]
What is that idiot doing?

364
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:11,518
Is he
trying to crash that thing right
into us?!

365
00:19:12,553 --> 00:19:14,855
Agh... I better dodge him
quick! Wait, what?!

366
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:16,657
Where'd the oars go?!(gasp)

367
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:18,158
[MERO](Under)
(laugh)

368
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,694
[KIMIHITO]
(big scream)

369
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,678
[KIMIHITO]
Are you okay, Miia?

370
00:19:37,778 --> 00:19:38,444
[MIIA]
Uh‐huh...

371
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:41,548
[MIIA]
(sneeze)(shiver)

372
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:44,117
[KIMIHITO]
Take this.

373
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:46,687
[MIIA]
(look)Oh, thank you, Darling.

374
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,993
[KIMIHITO/MIIA]
(look) (laughing)

375
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:56,262
[DRACO]
YOU LITTLE!

376
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,364
Get your filthy hands off my
bride this minute,

377
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,466
you pitiful
human!... You're nothing but
trash!‐

378
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:01,602
You could never compare
to‐

379
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,504
[MIIA]
Give it a rest, would ya?!

380
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:08,141
[DRACO]
That was my face (sneeze)

381
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:11,244
[KIMIHITO]
Come on now.

382
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:15,148
If you keep those wet clothes
on, you might accidentally
hibernate.

383
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:17,751
You should take them off and
warm up in the sun.

384
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:21,522
[DRACO]
Go away!... Don't touch me!...
What's wrong with you?!

385
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:23,389
[KIMIHITO]
Wait... There.

386
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,826
[DRACO]
(freak out)

387
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,330
[KIMIHITO] (shocked)
[MIIA] (shocked)So you're a
girl?!

388
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,865
[DRACO]
How could you?!

389
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:33,466
All I wanted was a friend...

390
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:36,169
Somebody who's a reptile species
just like me!

391
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:37,738
[MIIA]
Then why did you call me your
bride?

392
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:39,640
[KIMIHITO]
Do you always take your friends'
clothes off?

393
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,342
[DRACO]
Men are such savages!‐ This is
why I hate them!

394
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:45,512
[KIMIHITO] Whoa...
[MIIA] Is that why you sent
Darling that nasty letter?

395
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:48,281
[DRACO]
What nasty letter?! What are you
talking about?!

396
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:49,750
[MIIA]
(hm?)
[KIMIHITO] (huh?)

397
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,687
[DRACO]
You disgust me! YOU
FILTHY HUMAAAAAN!

398
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:58,792
[MIIA]
(shudder)(notice)
What's in here?

399
00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:01,227
[KIMIHITO]
(surprised)Uh, wait, don't open
it!

400
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:02,796
(uncertain)Let me see.

401
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:05,031
[MIIA] (hm?)
[KIMIHITO]
Turn around for a second.

402
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:07,701
[MIIA]
(surprised)Okay.

403
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:12,806
Darling! It's gorgeous... For
me?

404
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:16,843
[KIMIHITO]
Well, I saw it at the gift shop
and... uh...

405
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,646
I just thought it would look
pretty on you, that's all.

406
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:22,849
But then, I couldn't find the
right moment to...

407
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,085
(surprised)What's that for?

408
00:21:25,185 --> 00:21:26,419
[MIIA]
(giggle)

409
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,454
[MIIA]
You're always so sweet to me.

410
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:32,258
Thank you so much, Darling! I
love you!

411
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:37,664
[KIMIHITO]
(hm?)(scream)

412
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:39,432
[WOMAN 9B] I'm so sorry,
dolphins...

413
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:42,468
[SMITH] I see
someone went out without their
host family.

414
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:44,605
I'm letting you off easy
today...

415
00:21:44,705 --> 00:21:46,940
But this is the last
time. Understand?

416
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,077
[DRACO]
You have not heard the last of
me! (struggling)

417
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:56,016
[SMITH]
So she isn't the culprit after
all. Who could it be?

418
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:32,045
[KIMIHITO]
Ugh... Why'd you say you wanted
to come here again?

419
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:34,080
[PAPI]
Me?... I never said anything
like that.

420
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:38,251
[CEREA]
For as long as I am by your side
today, I swear to you, I will

421
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:43,489
never allow anyone to harm a
single hair upon your noble
head!
