1
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,041
[KAZAMA] I'm goin'
all in this time.

2
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:42,291
[SAKURA] Wow! Pretty big
gamble, don'cha think?

3
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,458
[KAZAMA] Maybe, but that's
how men play poker!

4
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,458
Whoa! Hell yeah!

5
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:49,916
[SAKURA] Ooh. sounds like
you've got a good hand.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,166
Please. Not like it's
gonna help you beat me.

7
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,958
I'll be the victorious one!

8
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,875
So that completes
the orbit, everybody.

9
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,583
Are we ready
for the big showdown?

10
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,833
[KAZAMA] Check it!
I got a straight flush!

11
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:03,333
[SAKURA] I got a
Master Instructor flush!

12
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,250
[CHITOSE] I got a
Mr. Kids flush!

13
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,000
[ROKA]
Joe flush in your face!

14
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,250
What kinda hand is that?

15
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,250
I told you already,
it's a Joe flush.

16
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,083
Do you guys even know
how to play this game?

17
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:14,541
Yes, and this is how
our club prefers to do it.

18
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,041
Allow me to instruct you,

19
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,125
based on the cards before us,
how a novice might arrive

20
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:20,416
at a Gaindhi flush
or a Pervender flush.

21
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,125
[KAZAMA]
Okay, I'm lost.

22
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,833
Let me break it
down for you, loser.

23
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:26,750
Matching picture cards always
beat matching number cards.

24
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,125
I guess that explains why

25
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:30,041
the deck we're playing with
is so freakin' enormous.

26
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:31,333
[TAKAO]
Hey, guys,

27
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,416
can someone tell me
if this hand is any good?

28
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,500
[CHITOSE]
Holy crap!

29
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,000
That's the "Scramble for
Porn Mags in Space flush!"

30
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:39,458
[ROKA] Which isn't just good,
it's the ultimate!

31
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,625
Wow!

32
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:42,750
I've never seen that
one before, awesome!

33
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,458
Oh. I had no idea.

34
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,291
How many picture cards
did you put in there?

35
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,583
You lose, which
means you have to

36
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,125
go buy everybody drinks.

37
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:50,708
Man, this is really messed up!

38
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,250
[CHITOSE] I want some
of that tasty juice

39
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,416
they sell at the convenience
store fifteen minutes from here.

40
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,458
[KAZAMA] Pick somethin'
from the cafeteria!

41
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,708
[SAKURA] I have a craving for
some ice-cold mineral water!

42
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:01,041
Get the trendiest, most
expensive kind they have!

43
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,583
[TAKAO]
I'll just have tea, please.

44
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,166
[ROKA] There's a certain
brand of grape soda

45
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,916
on sale right now that comes
with a free Mason figurine.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,416
You can get me one of those!

47
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,625
[TAKAO]
Ooh! I want that instead!

48
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,791
[KAZAMA] Why are these
girls so damn picky?

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,916
Man.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,333
The stupid games
they come up with

51
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,000
don't make any sense at all.

52
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,083
Huh?

53
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,458
You guys!
Hey! This is horrible!

54
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,625
It's Kenji, he's
been abducted again!

55
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,541
[ALL]
Huh? Again?

56
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,333
Wow. What a drama queen.

57
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,541
I don't understand what
the hell his problem is.

58
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,750
Does he enjoy being
a damsel in distress?

59
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,375
Wha... What are we
going to do?

60
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,333
We have to save him!
Oh! But how?

61
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,708
I say we leave him be.

62
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,458
I'm sure he brought
this on himself.

63
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,208
[ATARU] No. It isn't
Kenji's fault this time!

64
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,583
[CHITOSE]
Gah. The nerve of that girl.

65
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,125
She could've just sent
me the text directly.

66
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,000
[SAKURA]
Wait, you know her?

67
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,541
Unfortunately, I do.

68
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,208
Tama's a third year
student here.

69
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,291
So what gives?

70
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,375
You two have a
history or something?

71
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,750
I can't blow her off.

72
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,041
If I do, there's no telling
what she'll try next.

73
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,708
I'll explain the details later.
For now, let's go.

74
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,208
But where are we going?

75
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,958
One of the
third year classrooms.

76
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,416
[SIOU]
If you guys are going...

77
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,791
...then I'm coming too.

78
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,208
When did you get here?

79
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:00,708
Uh-oh.

80
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,208
Is it just me, or is he
not moving anymore?

81
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,583
[SHINSEN] It's probably
because you threw him too hard.

82
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,000
Most people don't
toss guys around.

83
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,791
You know the boss lady
doesn't take it easy on anyone.

84
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,666
But good point,
it's totally not normal.

85
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,875
I don't know.

86
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,708
I think it's less the
act of being thrown

87
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,166
and more the
psychological trauma

88
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,541
resulting from the fact that
it was a girl who did it.

89
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,000
Or maybe he's just a wimp.

90
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,333
Who the hell are you people?

91
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,125
What kind of coward
launches a surprise attack

92
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,166
and ties somebody up?
If you had come at me full on,

93
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,625
I guarantee that
this would've been

94
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,791
a completely different
situation altogether!

95
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:30,666
He's fine.

96
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,791
Must be his youth.

97
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,250
That's the only explanation.

98
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,500
Hello, I take it
from your lil' rant

99
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:36,625
that we don't ring any bells?

100
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,625
That's a hell of
an observation!

101
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,083
Thank you.

102
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,250
My name is Tama,
and this is my team.

103
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,458
I'm Matsubara.

104
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,958
And my name is Shinsen.

105
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,750
Naganuma.
Nice to meet you.

106
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,291
There is nothing
nice about this!

107
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,666
Buncha weirdos!

108
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,083
Wait a second. Hey. Ribbons?

109
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,791
You're third years, aren't you?

110
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,625
Yep, that's spot on.

111
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,375
Sorry about the whole
abduction thing,

112
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,708
but you looked easy to catch.

113
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,083
I figured I could
use you as bait

114
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,541
to lure your pals into my trap.

115
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,375
[KAZAMA] Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

116
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,875
Wait, what?

117
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,375
Who are you
trying to lure here?

118
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,875
[TAMA] The girls of the Game
Creation Club (Provisional).

119
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,291
So let me get this straight.

120
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,333
You only abducted me
to get to them?

121
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,750
[TAMA]
No, not exactly.

122
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,208
I have business with you,
too, as a matter of fact.

123
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,208
Oh, you do?

124
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,708
Yep. See, thing is--

125
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:19,750
That's right!

126
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,291
I have business
with you, too, punk!

127
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,500
What the hell?

128
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,750
I'm not gonna stand here

129
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,500
and let you pretend like
you don't know who I am.

130
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,791
Sorry, but I seem to be
drawing a complete blank

131
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:32,791
right now.

132
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:33,708
[SHINSEN]
What?

133
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,291
Oh, come on,
you just saw me.

134
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,166
At the tournament
for the bag, remember?

135
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,875
Wait. You were really there?

136
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,416
Are you calling me a liar?

137
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:44,458
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER 10A]
Attention,

138
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,958
the Game Tournament is over.

139
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,625
All students please leave
the stadium immediately.

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,708
[SHINSEN] Haven't we
waited long enough?

141
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,666
[SHINSEN] You remember now,
Captain Oblivious?

142
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,208
I was inside the robot, Isle.

143
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,916
How was I supposed
to know that was you?

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,375
Come on, be reasonable!

145
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,958
Well, I cheered you on
from the bleachers.

146
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,083
It was a pretty boring
tournament, to be honest.

147
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,583
No way!

148
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,583
When you told us to spy on
those Provisional dill-weeds,

149
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,500
I had to climb into
that honking pile of junk.

150
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,583
How come she got to chill
out in the bleachers, huh?

151
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:30,833
Don't ask me.

152
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,875
Oh. Well, would
you look at that,

153
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,375
you just got a text message.

It's from your
good buddy, Ataru.

how do you know Ataru?

00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,583
You know, they're likely
heading over here right now.

160
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:55,708
I wouldn't worry.

161
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,458
I can handle those
girls all by myself.

162
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,416
I'll send those
posers packing!

163
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,083
[KAZAMA] What? You're
gonna face them alone?

164
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,166
That's nuts!

165
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,375
[SHINSEN] Can someone
please explain

166
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,166
why the enemy
is worried about me?

167
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,166
As a third year student,

168
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,000
ganging up on others
happens to go against

169
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,750
my sense of pride.

170
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,083
But you don't
have any issues

171
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,500
with holding me hostage?

172
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,041
[SHINSEN] Plus,
I have a secret weapon.

173
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,375
This battle will be
over before it begins.

174
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,416
You'll see.

175
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,083
I don't understand.

176
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,208
Why is she so convinced
she'll be okay on her own?

177
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,125
'Cause she's nuts.

178
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,375
She's gonna get
her butt kicked.

179
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,416
Then maybe you
should stop her!

180
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,583
Has anyone ever mentioned

181
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,250
that you're way too nice
to your enemies?

182
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,750
Besides,

183
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,791
Barfy hates when underclassmen
don't take her seriously,

184
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:36,916
it's a pet peeve.

185
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,083
And I think it's important

186
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,291
to be respectful of
Barfy and her pride.

187
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,750
Okay, hold on.
Look. Let's get real.

188
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,958
You just called her Barfy,
how's that respectful?

189
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,083
[SHINSEN]
I'll be right back.

190
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,791
She might stand a
chance after all.

191
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,208
[ROKA]
Hello, passing through!

192
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,375
Just a couple nobodies
with brooms!

193
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,291
By pretending
that we're cleaning,

194
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,958
this brilliant
strategy will allow us

195
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,250
to reach the third
year classrooms

196
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,458
without drawing
attention to ourselves.

197
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,000
Yes, it's an excellent plan.

198
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,250
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
it makes us stand out more.

199
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,166
But--

200
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,541
[BOYS]
All right, all right!

201
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:11,375
So, uh...

202
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,541
These third year students

203
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,250
who don't seem to
like you very much,

204
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,750
the ones behind the kidnapping,

205
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,041
are they the former
student council?

206
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,916
[TAKAO] Tama Sakai, the
ex-Student Body President.

207
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,125
Naganuma, the ex-Vice President.

208
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,000
Matsubara, the ex-Treasurer.

209
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,791
Shinsen, the ex-Clerk.

210
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,000
When it comes to that crew,

211
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,250
I've heard that
even the teachers

212
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,958
bow down to their every whim.

213
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,291
So, what's the backstory,

214
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,333
why are you guys
at each other's throats?

215
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,708
This has been going on
ever since we were little girls.

216
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,791
Do you know why I became
Student Body President

217
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,250
to begin with?

218
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,333
It was for the sole purpose
of pissing that girl off.

219
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,791
I don't think it's
quite accurate to say

220
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,208
we're "at each
other's throats".

221
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,375
This situation is merely
the result of years and years

222
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,666
of unfortunate timing

223
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,833
and a string of regrettable
miscommunications.

224
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,000
[CHITOSE]
I wish she'd graduate

225
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,000
and spend an extra
year as a ronin!

226
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,333
And then she can
get her butt kicked

227
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,916
by the hardships of real life!

228
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
[TAKAO] If you really
can't stand her that much,

229
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,875
why did you go to
the same high school?

230
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,208
[CHITOSE]
I didn't make good grades,

231
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,500
and they pretty much
let anyone in this place.

232
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,541
[ROKA]
What the... Is that--

233
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,208
[CHITOSE] It's Isle,
the super-secret robot

234
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,833
that's been passed down
through the Science Club

235
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,625
for generations!

236
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,333
And the President
of the Science Club!

237
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,125
I did not expect
him to be here!

238
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,375
Tennouzu, what in the
world are you doing, man?

239
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,541
Please, forgive me.

240
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,666
The ex-president's got me
by the joystick.

241
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,583
[SHINSEN laughing]

242
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,291
[SHINSEN] It looks like
the jig is finally up

243
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,416
for the Game Creation
Club (Provisional)!

244
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,958
Oh, crap. It's so hot.
I'm roasting.

245
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,208
[CHITOSE] Great.
Barfy is inside that thing.

246
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,583
Barfy? You mean Barfy Barfy?

247
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,625
Wait.

248
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,708
Isn't that Shinsen,
the ex-Clerk?

249
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:45,958
[SHINSEN]
Don't call me Barfy,

250
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,583
you're gonna make me cry!

251
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:48,708
So what's the deal,

252
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,083
how did she end up
with the name Barfy?

253
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,250
[retching noise]

254
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,083
[CHITOSE] There's a
story behind that.

255
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,958
During a school assembly,
she hurled all over the stage.

256
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,541
The one who actually
coined the name was Tama.

257
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,875
Hey, Shinsen,

258
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,625
since you barfed on stage
in front of everyone,

259
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,208
from now on,
I'm callin' you Barfy.

260
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,958
[SHINSEN] Where do you
get off making fun of me?

261
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,375
You'll all go down for this,

262
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,708
--every last one of you!
-- [TENNOUZU] Be careful,

263
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,500
Miss Barfy!
If you keep doing that,

264
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,625
you're going to knock
Isle into reverse!

265
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,500
Enough talk.

266
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,375
Whaddaya say we bust
right through 'em!

267
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,583
I'm in.

268
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,708
It's been a while since
we kicked some butt!

269
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,125
Uh, you guys?

270
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,416
Here comes the fire!

271
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,500
And the earth!

272
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,958
Water, too!

273
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:28,333
Put all three together, you
get a Catastrophe Attack!

274
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,541
[TAKAO] Guys?
Are you just whacking it?

275
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,750
[SHINSEN]
The clanging is too much!

276
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,125
I think I'm gonna hurl!

277
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:36,791
Please! Stop!

278
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,625
Don't be mean to Isle,
he's fragile!

279
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,125
If you don't want them

280
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,625
to tear your precious robot
into a heap of scrap metal,

281
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,750
I'd man the hell up and hand
over that controller pronto!

282
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,083
Actually, that thing
looks magnificent.

283
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,250
Can I drive it for a while?

284
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,083
If Isle breaks,

285
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,041
the science club
will never forgive me!

286
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,708
[TENNOUZU] Everybody
cut it out right now!

287
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,583
[CHITOSE]
I never noticed

288
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:00,916
because of those
nerdy glasses,

289
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,958
but Tennouzu's
eyes are sparkly!

290
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,708
You're right.
On the other hand,

291
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,208
it might just be the
overhead fluorescent light

292
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,875
bouncing off his
prescription lenses.

293
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,208
But what do you
think it means?

294
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,666
That he was only
playing games before,

295
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,875
and now he's serious!

296
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,333
I'll show you what Isle
is truly capable of!

297
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,000
[TENNOUZU]
Ultimate Special Move.

298
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,500
The Deadly Isle Spin Attack!

299
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,875
[SHINSEN screaming]

300
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,083
Uh...

301
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,500
I think we might be in
over our heads here!

302
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,875
There is a silver lining.

303
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,041
Barfy is bound to get
sick at some point, right?

304
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,916
You know, there's really
no compelling reason

305
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,375
we have to fight her.
You guys wanna skip it?

306
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,291
[TENNOUZU] This thing can
only move in one direction!

307
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,541
[SAKURA]
Look how fast it's spinning.

308
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,333
There's no way Barfy
makes it out of there

309
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,833
without puking her guts out!

310
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,958
[ROKA] Takao, what on
earth are you doing?

311
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,791
You're in danger!
Flee before it's too late!

312
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,458
Easy for you to say!
I'm petrified!

313
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,541
[CHITOSE]
Careful!

314
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,125
Puff out your chest like that
and you'll get smacked.

315
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,333
Hey! This is how
I normally stand!

316
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,416
Get outta my way.

317
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,750
[retching noise]

318
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,208
[ALL exclaiming]

319
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,916
[TENNOUZU]
Isle, no!

320
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,250
[ATARU] Don't worry
about the robot,

321
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,916
worry about Barfy!
She's clearly been knocked out!

322
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,833
[SIOU]
Ugh. The stench!

323
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,750
[TENNOUZU] This is
gonna make him rust!

324
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,333
Too bad.

325
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,416
From the sound of things,

326
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,916
it seems Barfy
didn't win after all.

327
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,625
Well, I kinda thought
that might happen.

328
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:35,791
Oh.

329
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:36,916
I should take care
of my business with you

330
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,500
before they arrive.

331
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,625
You know that I owe
you big time, right?

332
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,708
Thank you for taking
the ten thousand yen

333
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,791
I got for New Year's
to the police.

334
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,250
Huh?

335
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,750
[TAMA] You see, that money
was a gift from my grandpa.

336
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,458
It's really important to me.

337
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,500
[KAZAMA]
Wait...

338
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,375
Don't tell me
that you're...

339
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,416
...Little Tama.

340
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,833
I have to say,

341
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,416
when a guy calls me
Little Tama, it's kinda hot.

342
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,125
[CHITOSE]
Hey, Tama. What's up?

343
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,916
I've come here today
to rescue Princess Pinch.

344
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,708
[TAKAO]
Aw, dang it!

345
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,083
That stupid robot scratched
up my cell phone strap.

346
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,208
It certainly took you
long enough to get here.

347
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,125
It's been a long time
since we met face to face.

348
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,333
Yeah, you're right.

349
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,291
I haven't seen you in
who knows how long.

350
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,833
Uh, we all ran into each
other yesterday at lunch.

351
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,666
[KAZAMA]
That's a long time?

352
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,000
So we did.

353
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:59,291
You had the nerve to stand in
front of me in the lunch line.

354
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,333
Now that I think of it,

355
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,166
that's what set me
off this time.

356
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,875
You're kidding!
That's nothing!

357
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,500
It's not nothing
at all, is it now?

358
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,833
Oh, as a matter of
fact, anything but.

359
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,166
[KAZAMA] Whoa, let's
think about this!

360
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,833
You two just agreed
on something!

361
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,625
Roka, now!

362
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,458
[KAZAMA] Whoa.
Did you guys see that?

363
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,750
She blocked the bag
attack with her pigtails!

364
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,041
[TAMA giggles]

365
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,833
Hey, everybody, look,
I caught myself a Roka.

366
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,125
[TAMA]
That hurt.

367
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,000
I thought she was
gonna pull my hair out.

368
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,875
Just who the heck are you?

369
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,000
Told ya, I'm Tama. Right?

370
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,458
Stop squeezing me, please.

371
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,833
Aw, yeah.

372
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,166
The pigtail block--
works like a charm every time.

373
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,750
After she got hit
with the bag attack,

374
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,250
she went from occasionally
wearing pigtails for fun

375
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,416
to wearing them every single day
for her own protection.

376
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,166
Guys, it's Barfy!
She's okay!

377
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,208
[SIOU] Why is she
wearing her PE uniform?

378
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,250
[ATARU]
Well, I mean,

379
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,750
she did puke all
over her clothes.

380
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:17,958
[SHINSEN]
And would anyone like

381
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,666
to take a wild guess
as to who's responsible

382
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,000
for the pigtails maneuver?

383
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,916
Oh yeah, that's right,
it was me.

384
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,166
Not exactly somethin'
to brag about.

385
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,500
The whole thing started

386
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,625
back when we were in
elementary school together.

387
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,166
[KAZAMA]
Okay, first of all,

388
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,958
that's a disgusting way
to start a flashback!

389
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,250
And second, you totally
deserve that nickname!

390
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,166
[FEMALE TEACHER 10A]
Goodness gracious me.

391
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,166
Shinsen, did you get carsick?

392
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,500
No, ma'am, that's not it.

393
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,916
Tama made her sick
by playing Kabuki.

394
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,958
[FEMALE TEACHER 10A]
Kabuki?

395
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:53,375
[YOUNG TAMA]
Kabuki!

396
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,750
Tama Sakai,
you should be ashamed.

397
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,333
You know better than to play
Kabuki in front of her!

398
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,083
No Kabuki, understand?

399
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,875
[YOUNG TAMA] I understand,
and I'm very sorry.

400
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,208
You have my word.

401
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,041
I will seal my Kabuki
away forever.

402
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:17,958
[YOUNG TAMA]
Eureka!

403
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:21,708
Double Kabuki!

404
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,083
[FEMALE TEACHER 10A] Tama Sakai,
what did I just say?

405
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:25,750
So you see.

406
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,416
There's only one
person responsible

407
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,000
for the pigtail move,
and that's me.

408
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,041
Yeah, I remember
that whole situation.

409
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,916
It really takes me back.

410
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,166
I just realized you three

411
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,625
have been friends since
you were little kids.

412
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:36,875
Listen, weirdos,

413
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,750
I don't feel like taking
a walk down memory lane!

414
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,458
[TAMA] Well at any rate,
the point is,

415
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,791
I don't wear my hair like this
'cause I think it's cute.

416
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,625
There's a practical
purpose behind it.

417
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,083
Honestly, I think it
looks way better

418
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,458
when I wear it straight down.

419
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,458
No one cares about
your stupid hair!

420
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,541
More importantly,

421
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,458
I think it's time
you put Roka down.

422
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,583
I see. So Roka comes first.

423
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,000
I thought you'd
be more concerned

424
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,708
with Princess Pinch over there.

425
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,333
Will you please
stop calling me that?

426
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,416
[ATARU] Hang in there,
Princess Pinch!

427
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,208
We've come here to rescue you!

428
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,166
If you're gonna do something,
let's get the ball rolling!

429
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,666
I'm in a really depressing
situation here, okay?

430
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,208
[TAMA] Aw, since you're
in such distress,

431
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,708
I'll get straight to the point.

432
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,666
I can't put up with the Game
Creation Club (Provisional)

433
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,833
anymore, and I'm
ordering you to disband!

434
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,333
[KAZAMA]
Why should we?

435
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,583
The moment I stepped down
as the Student Body President,

436
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,000
you stuck your dirty fingers
where they didn't belong

437
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,458
and began messing
with everything.

438
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,458
You appropriated
the student council

439
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:29,000
and started that weird club
you're all so fond of.

440
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,250
You used the council to
win the FUF Festival.

441
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,791
I will not watch the legacy
I worked so hard to build

442
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,375
be destroyed by
a poser like you!

443
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,791
[KAZAMA] Shouldn't the
current council members

444
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,333
be the ones who are upset?

445
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,208
So, as the ex-Student
Body President,

446
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,458
I decree the following:

447
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,666
From this day forward,
your club doesn't exist.

448
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,416
The Game Creation Club
(Provisional) is done forever.

449
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,291
Fat chance!

450
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,541
[KAZAMA]
So you object?

451
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,791
Uh, yeah.

452
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,250
Did you not just
hear what she said?

453
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,208
She threatened to
shut down our club for good.

454
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,333
Right. Good point.

455
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,708
So now what?

456
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,208
[TAMA]
What do you think?

457
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,500
If I remember right,

458
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,083
you're the president
of the Game Creation Club,

459
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,500
aren't you?

460
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:07,833
Do you really want this
good for nothing wannabe club

461
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:08,708
stealing focus?

462
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,500
Uh, I, uh...
think that...

463
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:17,708
Yes!

464
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,250
Competition is always good.

465
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,333
It's nice to have a rival club
around to keep things fresh!

466
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,791
Tell me. Why are you
defending these hacks?

467
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,791
[KAZAMA] Don't drag
an outsider into this.

468
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,041
I take it you're also opposed
to losing this silly club?

469
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,208
Believe it or not,

470
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,041
I signed on with 'em
'cause I wanted to.

471
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,291
And I'll tell you this much.

472
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,750
I'm not about to
let you come in here

473
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,958
and tell us we
have to shut it down.

474
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,000
If you want us gone,
then you'll have to earn it.

475
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,666
We're challenging you to a
head-to-head competition.

476
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,666
We'll put the club
up as collateral.

477
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,000
But our team gets
to pick the game!

478
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,166
[TAMA laughs]

479
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,750
You've got a deal.

480
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,375
How dare you decide
something like that

481
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,291
--on your own!
--Not the foot thing again!

482
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,000
Don't you get it?
If we lose, we're toast!

483
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,291
She wanted us to challenge them.
You fell right into her trap!

484
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,375
Come on.

485
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,583
Aren't you sick
and tired of that girl

486
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,125
acting like she can
do whatever she wants?

487
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,875
Be honest now.
She pisses you off

488
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,875
more than anything in
the world, and you know it!

489
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,416
You're right.

490
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,916
The thought of her
makes me nauseous.

491
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,916
Yeah, she is pretty
annoying, huh?

492
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,041
I shall do whatever it takes
to protect our home.

493
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,250
We must prevail, comrades!

494
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,208
[KAZAMA] Dude.
You hardly ever show up.

495
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,083
I've got a plan.
Someone go to the clubroom

496
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,291
and grab the Scramble for Porn
Mags in Space Game!

497
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,583
We play that,
we'll win for sure!

498
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:32,458
[KAZAMA]
That's definitely one of the

499
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,000
worst ideas I've ever heard!

500
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,000
Guys, I think you're
forgetting something.

501
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:40,000
Aren't you invincible once
the opponent's on your turf?

502
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,041
Or was that all just talk?

503
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,458
We are, yeah.

504
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,166
The Game Creation Club
(Provisional) means business.

505
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,583
[TAMA]
Well, who would've thought

506
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,541
Princess Pinch would be so
cool when I kidnapped him?

507
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,000
Kazama can be
all sorts of things

508
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,541
when he needs to be.

509
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,416
But his Princess Pinch
stat is really high.

510
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,625
If we win this competition,

511
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,083
no one's allowed to
call me that ever again,

512
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,416
do you understand me?

513
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,791
There's one issue.

514
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,916
I have no problem
fighting in a game battle.

515
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,083
But we only have three--

516
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,791
No that's not right. Four.

517
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,041
We only have four people,

518
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,875
which means our teams
aren't equally matched.

519
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,250
You almost said three
people just now,

520
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,083
didn't you?

521
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,250
Okay, who did you leave out?

522
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,416
To make it even,

523
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,333
you can only pick
four players to compete.

524
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,708
All right, then.

525
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,750
Now that that's done,
what game are we playing?

526
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,208
You guys!
We need to make a decision!

527
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,250
Why don't you
quit your watching

528
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,500
and help us out, Prez?

529
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,291
She's right!

530
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,416
Yeah! Help us!

531
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,916
Don't you have
any bright ideas?

532
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,291
Wait a second!
I'm not even in your club!

533
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,541
[KAZAMA]
Who cares?

534
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,583
And will somebody
please untie me, already?

535
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,666
This may be easier
than I thought.

536
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:46,666
[NAGANUMA] Man, it's dark.
Open the door!

537
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,083
[TAKAO] Calm down
and let me think,

538
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:49,375
--I'll come up with something.
--[NAGANUMA] Dumb door!

539
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:50,750
--[CHITOSE] All right,
--It's stuck!

540
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,083
--just know we're
--Guys! Come on!

541
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,625
--counting on you, Prez!
--Can someone let me out?

542
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,000
[SAKURA] You're the president,
you always think up

543
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:55,791
--something good!
--[NAGANUMA] It smells awful

544
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:56,916
in here!

545
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,833
[TAKAO] Except I'm
not your President,

546
00:23:57,916 --> 00:23:58,916
or have you all
forgotten that?

547
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
[NAGANUMA] Hey!
Can you guys hear me?

548
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:04,166
Seriously!
This isn't funny anymore!

549
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,875
[SIOU] Stop wasting
your time, friend.

550
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,375
This locker doesn't
latch correctly,

551
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:09,666
making it impossible
to open from the inside.

552
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,375
That, and they
clearly care not.

553
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:13,583
Relax. Be quiet. Enjoy.

554
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:14,833
[NAGANUMA] If we're quiet,
they won't hear us

555
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:17,250
and we'll never get out!
How can you be so calm?

556
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,416
[SIOU]
How can I not be?

557
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,125
The darkness is so tranquil!
So perfect.

558
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,166
[NAGANUMA]
Um, you're scaring me.

559
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,875
Get me out of here, please!
