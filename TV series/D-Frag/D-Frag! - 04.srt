That's a reasonable response.

[CHITOSE] What is Takao's
Secret Slash Attack, you ask?

8
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,333
The signature method
by which Takao channels

00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:09,916
jiggly-jug kinetic energy to
create an offensive strike!

10

The technique has
been passed down

the Takao family line
for generations!

12

Alas, it is a move that only

that supposed to mean?

[ROKA] Are you implying
we're short-term?

[ROKA] Um. Hey, guys...
Would you...

158
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,500
Would you mind coming
with me, please?

159
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,916
[BOTH]
Hm?

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,083
Uh. If you need us...

161
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,083
There's safety in numbers!

162
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,875
[ALL THREE]
Bye. We're off to pee.

163
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:09,208
[ROKA] Pick up the pace, ladies.
I can't hold it much longer.

164
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,333
Oh my gosh.
That girl, I swear.

165
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,583
Wait! Get back
here and untie me!

166
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,416
Um, excuse me.
A little help?

167
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,541
[TAKAO] Why are you smiling?
Stop it, that's creepy!

168
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,166
Look, contrary to what
you might like to believe,

169
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,416
not everyone enjoys this!
Quit looking at me like that!

170
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,291
Oh god, now I have to pee!

171
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,500
Oh, for the love of--
somebody help!

172
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,250
[KAZAMA groans]

173
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,250
[ODAWARA laughs]

174
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,833
Welcome back.

175
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,500
I gotta hand it to ya,
it took guts

176
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,166
standin' up to us when
there was only three of you.

177
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,208
I mean, seriously. We're the
Band of Fourteen Devils!

178
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,208
[KAZAMA] Man, who knew a bunch
o' hipster arcade jockeys

179
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,500
could hold their own in a fight?

180
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,125
[ODAWARA] Tch. You prob'ly
think we're a bunch

181
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:01,375
o' hipster arcade jockeys
or somethin', yeah?

182
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,625
You'd be surprised how much
muscle a man can pack on

183
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,083
testin' his mettle
'gainst Bongo Blitz.

184
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:09,875
And one day, Fujou Academy
is gonna bow down to us!

185
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,958
Ah! Look at this, boss!
You're not gonna believe it!

186
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,958
Hey, stay out of
my bag, ya jerk!

187
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,625
[KAZAMA] I don't remember
puttin' anything in there.

188
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,583
[ODAWARA] Whoa!
What the hell is this?

189
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,125
I don't know!

in Space Game, Volume Two!

Why would she stuff that
stupid thing into my bag?

192
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,583
[KAZAMA] I don't really remember
why I became a delinquent.

193
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,291
Somebody pissed me off,
I'd take 'em down.

194
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,583
They'd start a fight,
I'd end it.

195
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,458
And this is where... it gets me?

196
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,458
Nobody cares! I said
we're goin' first

197
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,041
and that's all there is to it!

198
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,708
[ODAWARA] Since when do you call
the shots around here, sun roof?

[GANG MEMBERS argue]

Yo, Kenji,
are you awake?

201
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,083
Yokoshima! Where's Nagayama?

Hangin' out.

203
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,625
Why the hell they have us
all tied up differently?

204
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,166
[KAZAMA grunts]

205
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,833
[KAZAMA] Crap. The ropes
are too tight to budge.

206
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,583
And here they all are
with their backs to me!

207
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,875
That game o' yours has 'em
all at each other's throats.

208
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,708
It's not my game, man.
She snuck it into my bag.

209
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,250
[GANG MEMBERS argue]

210
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,250
Point is, I'm the boss!
I call dibs on the first turn!

211
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,791
Get over yourself, Odawara!

212
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,666
Nobody here cares that
you think you're the boss!

213
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,666
[ODAWARA] Uh-uh. He did not
just go there! That's messed up!

214
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,166
And besides, man,
a good leader should know

215
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,541
when it's time for
him to step aside!

216
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:43,250
Fine! It's a four-player game.
Let's break into groups

217
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,958
of four and work out
who goes first after that!

218
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,666
[ALL] That's not
stepping aside.

219
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,375
But it's actually a pretty
reasonable suggestion!

220
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,791
[ODAWARA laughs]

221
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,666
Idiots. There's nine of us here.

222
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,916
Which means we only got
enough for two teams.

223
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,208
Somebody's gonna get left out.
I wonder who it'll be.

[ODAWARA] Aw, come on!
Really, guys? Really?

225

ever their leader?

[TAKASAKI] Listen up!
The only way for us

227
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,375
to settle this now
is a battle of wills!

228
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,750
[THREE GANG MEMBERS]
A battle of wills?

229
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,916
Yup. And I say whoever
has the will to show

230
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,666
how badly he wants to play
first takes home the gold.

231
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,416
To start. Lemme show ya what
I'm prepared to put down.

of her looking all flustered

putting down Funabori--

you it wasn't!

fun with new friends, huh?

driving a wedge between us,

wanted to play this game?

00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,833
I don't even really know
why I just did that.

308
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,875
[MYOKAKU] Huh? He's mumbling,
I can't hear 'im.

309
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,833
[HAIJIMA]
I say we beat him up!

310
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,208
[KAZAMA]
What's wrong with me?

311
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,750
Why'd I just lose my cool
there all of a sudden?

312
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,500
[CHITOSE] I say
we bury him alive.

313
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,833
[TAKASAKI]
Yeah! I like that!

314
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,291
[SAKURA] Ooh, we could
tie him to a cinder block

315
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,916
and drop him in a pool!

316
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,875
[HAIJIMA]
Whoa.

317
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,666
[ROKA]
I have a better idea.

318
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,416
We stuff him in a bag.

319
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,791
[TAKASAKI]
Oh, that's a good one!

320
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:35,000
Wait, hold up! Who the
hell are you people?

321
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,416
Who, us? Just a group
of girls that got lost

322
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
on their way back
from the bathroom.

323
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,750
Oh, that's a great
cover story, bravo.

324
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,625
[TAKASAKI]
What's going on?

325
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:45,791
[KODAMA] Ain't that the
student body president?

326
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:46,916
[HAIJIMA] Please don't
scratch me, Takao.

327
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,083
[KANEKO]
Please don't what?

328
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,916
[ODAWARA] What, uh, what brings
you ladies out here today?

329
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,083
You little bastard!
You sent for 'em, didn't you?

330
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,375
Yeah, cause that
makes sense.

331
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,333
[ALL FOUR] No, but we
did come to rescue him.

332
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,333
Traitor! No fair!

333
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,916
Does the bro code mean
nothing to you, man?

334
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,458
You can't bring
chicks into this!

335
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,000
Don't go there, boss!

336
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,333
Nobody here needs reminding
that we're hopelessly single!

337
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,875
[KAZAMA] Whoa, I think
you've got the wrong idea!

338
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,083
I gotta admit, this is
pretty big. I mean,

339
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:15,250
who'd've thought the president
would go for guy like him?

340
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,291
[CHITOSE]
What?

341
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,416
[ODAWARA] Oh, sorry!
I take it back!

342
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,958
So, uh, you're his girlfriend?

343
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,166
[SAKURA laughs]

344
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,791
[ODAWARA] I'll take
that as a no.

345
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,541
Then, you?

346
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,791
Indeed I am. We're islands
in the stream, he and I.

347
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,541
Held fast by an
indestructible bond

348
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,916
precious few can
hope to experience.

349
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
[ODAWARA] I'm gonna
take that as a no, too.

350
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:42,333
So that's gotta mean Takao is,
uh, kind of maybe... Except...

351
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,000
Ew, no! There's
nothing going on

352
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,333
between the two of us
and there never will be!

353
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,500
[KODAMA]
No!

354
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,375
[ODAWARA] I think we
have a winner, boys!

355
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,583
I am not Kazama's girlfriend!

356
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:54,625
[ODAWARA] Huh? Sorry.
Read too much into it. My bad.

357
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:55,916
[GANG MENBERS] But...
then why did you girls

358
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,958
come here to
rescue this guy?

359
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,375
Well, because he's...

360
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,000
[ALL THREE] ...a member
of the Game Creation Club!

361
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,375
[TAKAO winces]

362
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,666
Now, then. There's the
hard way and the easy way.

363
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,125
And 'cause of your
arcade shenanigans,

364
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,708
I'm leaning toward the hard.

365
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,083
Crap! These girls
are itching for a brawl.

366
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,458
What're we
supposed to do?

367
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,541
[TAKASAKI] This is
our big chance, boss!

368
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,083
What?

369
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,666
[TAKASAKI] If we take 'em out--
and I don't mean on a date--

370
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,666
Fujou Academy
will be ours!

371
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,916
You did not just
seriously say that!

372
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,666
Dude! We can't fight chicks!
What'll people think of us?

373
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,958
Stop being such
a pussy willow!

374
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,208
Hey, hey!

375
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,583
Look. If you wanna reign
supreme, you've gotta be

376
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,041
the most ruthless bastard alive!
Those are the rules!

377
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,083
You know what being
ruthless means, don't you?

378
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,458
It means doing
whatever it takes!

379
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,125
[ODAWARA]
Reign supreme...

380
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,416
[percussive music plays]

381
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,291
[ODAWARA grunts]

382
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,083
[ODAWARA]
No, no, no!

383
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,791
Not this song!
I never get past it!

384
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:49,291
I'm not gonna make it.

385
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,500
Mind if I
help you out?

386
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,458
Komagawa!
That's cheating, ain't it?

387
00:17:58,541 --> 00:17:59,750
Only if you play to win.

388
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,708
If you're just havin' fun,
who cares, right?

389
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:05,000
Hey. Whaddya say we show
this song who's boss?

390
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,708
Imagine how cool it'd
be if all The Devils

391
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,750
could find it in their
hearts to cooperate.

392
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,041
Get our own house in order and
the school would be a breeze.

393
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,625
Makes you stop an' think.

394
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,750
[ODAWARA] Mmm... The school
would be a breeze...

395
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:21,041
He was really onto somethin'
there. Miss you lots, bro.

396
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,375
Whatever it takes,
you guys! Get 'em!

397
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,291
[GANG MEMBERS]
Yes, sir!

398
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,958
That's what I'm
talkin' about!

399
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:26,958
[GANG MEMBERS]
Fight!

400
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,208
[CHITOSE laughs]

401
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,916
Trust me, guys, this is
not a good idea!

402
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,625
[HAIJIMA]
Damn! Kodama's out!

403
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,416
[MYOKAKU] Meh, he's just
the token runt we keep around

404
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,875
to have an even fourteen.

405
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,125
We got this, dude! Let's go!

406
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,375
[HAIJIMA]
Hey, President!

407
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,666
Try out our Ultimate
Twin Dragon Attack!

408
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,666
[MYOKAKU &amp; HAIJIMA]
Dra! Dra! Dra! Dra! Dra! Dra!...

409
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,416
[CHITOSE] I'm guessing the whole
idea is to annoy me to death?

410
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,041
Try mine on for size.

411
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,541
I call it "Dra to the head"!

412
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:54,875
[KAZAMA]
That's a door!

413
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,416
I need a vacation.

414
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,000
Maybe somewhere with
balloons and sausage?

415
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,250
[TAKASAKI] You're good,
I'll give you that.

416
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,791
But why the water? I'm not
seeing your thought process.

417
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,708
Oh, it's nothing fancy.
You see... I sorta have

418
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,291
a weird thing about touching
people I think are groddy.

419
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,000
So I like to wash my
hands between bouts.

420
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,083
[TAKAO] Ooh! Girl knows
how to hit below the belt.

421
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,083
Hey. Focus on
the ropes, please.

422
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,916
Shut up, I'm working on it.

423
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,166
Hope you realize this is what
comes of acting like a thug.

424
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,291
Eh. Anyway, thanks.
You're my hero.

425
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,708
Yeah. You're welcome.
You owe me one.

426
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,416
Heh. Well, I'm good for
it whenever you need me.

427
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,541
We're going about this wrong.
Let's tie up the weak one first!

428
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,291
Straight up.
It's two against one!

429
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,541
Aw, c'mon!
Don't do this!

430
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,125
Please! Whatever
you want, it's yours!

431
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:04,166
Whoa! When you got your guy
on the mat, the fight's over.

432
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,916
He backed down!
It's finished! You win!

433
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,166
Ah...? Oh, dear.
Where am I?

434
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,750
Geez, when you get serious,

435
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,208
it's like you're lost in your
own little world. It's weird.

436
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,708
[ODAWARA] No! It's you,
isn't it? You're the one!

437
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,541
I can tell from the way you use
that one-of-a-kind bag attack!

438
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:21,833
Of course!

439
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,916
There's all kinds of
stories about you!

440
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,333
You're the girl
who ended the fight

441
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,500
between the current president
and her predecessor!

442
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,791
The one who really
calls the shots!

443
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,750
Roka Shibasaki...
a.k.a. "Ultimate Darkness!"

444
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,166
You're Fujou's
underground boss!

445
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,291
[KAZAMA] What the hell
is he talking about?

446
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,291
You're the underground
boss? Seriously?

447
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,458
[KAZAMA]
So, in other words,

448
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,291
she's the most powerful
person at school.

449
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:48,416
I would give anything--
anything--to have her life.

450
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,375
And that's really messed up.

451
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,000
[ROKA] It's not what you think!
I don't care about the power!

452
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,458
It means nothing to me!
I don't even know how I got it!

453
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,875
[ODAWARA] Heh...
This's my chance!

454
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,916
She's wide open!
If I can defeat her now...

455
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,166
...I'll be king!

456
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,000
[ODAWARA roars]

457
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,291
Kazama, no!

458
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:15,208
[ODAWARA shudders]

459
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,541
[KAZAMA] Tch...
You spineless coward!

460
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:21,208
Nobody raises a hand to
the president of my club!

461
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,666
[ROKA]
Uh, thank you very much.

462
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,875
If anyone should
say that, it's me.

463
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,291
Seriously, I owe
you big for this.

464
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,208
Oh, I was just doing my duty
as your club president.

465
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:38,333
[KAZAMA]
Ah. Okay.

466
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,416
[TAKAO sighs]

467
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,958
[CHITOSE &amp; SAKURA giggle]

468
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:47,250
[ROKA] Okey-doke.
That's taken care of.

469
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,333
I propose we play a game!

470
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,291
[KAZAMA seethes]

471
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,541
[KAZAMA] When could
you have even made that?

472
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,500
[ROKA] Games are
evolving all the time.

473
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:56,708
[KAZAMA] Yeah, well,
guess what? I don't care!

474
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,041
I'm not playing it!

475
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,625
[ROKA] Sheesh. Calm down.
Why are you so upset?

476
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,291
[KAZAMA]
Because!

477
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,041
Hang in there, Kenji.

478
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,625
Things are gonna get a little
weird, but you got this.

479
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,166
Trust me.

480
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:41,083
[ATARU] Legend of the
Heroic Masochist, Ataru!

481
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:45,000
[ATARU &amp; TAKAO]
Uhhh...

482
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,416
[MINAMI] Sorry, kids.
I really don't think

483
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
I can let this one slide.

484
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:51,333
[TAKAO] You're a teacher!
Why do you have stun gun?

485
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:52,958
[MINAMI]
Self-defense, mostly.

486
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,958
Unbelievable.
All the slack I give you,

487
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:58,875
and you still have to push
the envelope. I swear.

488
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:00,583
Not to rock the boat here,
but I'm rather inclined

489
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:03,000
to think a stun gun
is pushing the envelope.

490
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,916
Please! Say something,
Vice President!

491
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,458
[ATARU shudders]

492
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:10,083
[ATARU] A jolt from that thing
could do some major damage.

493
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:12,541
So then, why...
Why is my body aching

494
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,916
for her to zap the
everloving piss out of me?

495
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,500
[TAKAO]
What?

496
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:19,791
Ah, to hell with it! I'll take
what I've got coming! Charge!

497
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:20,791
[MINAMI]
Okay.

498
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,041
[TAKAO]
Idiot.

499
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,708
[zapping sound;
ATARU screams]

500
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,875
[ATARU]
Yeah, daddy's been bad!
