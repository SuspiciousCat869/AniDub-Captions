1
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,333
[KAZAMA] No, like I said--
you've got it all wrong!

2
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,083
I swear, it was a completely
honorable battle!

3
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,541
Yes, honorable!

4
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,041
[KAZAMA] We weren't lookin'
in on those girls--honest!

5
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,500
[ATARU] Sir, what sort of
mountebanks do you take us for?

6
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:48,500
[KAZAMA]
What he said!

7
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:51,375
[ATARU]
Be merciful!

8
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:56,041
You went in the locker room.
Right in through the window.

9
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:59,416
[KAZAMA &amp; ATARU]
Uh-huh. That did happen.

10
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:04,875
Pervert.

11
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,083
[KAZAMA &amp; ATARU scream]

12
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:10,125
[KAZAMA]
No, I'm not!

13
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,416
It was just a dream.

14
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,166
But I did get suspended,
so yeah, there's that.

15
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:21,291
[TAKAO] I thought the club
was finally getting shut down!

16
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:23,125
So why haven't
they been disbanded?

17
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,833
This doesn't make any sense!

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,958
Well, we got ourselves
a new member.

19
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:29,041
Our head-count's
kosher now, so...

20
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:33,375
we can keep chugging along
for the time being an--

21
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:36,541
Give it back, Takao. Geez.

22
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:38,750
Kenji Kazama!

23
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,666
Let's drink a toast
to the survival

24
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,875
of the Game Creation Club.

25
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,041
[ALL cheer]

26
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,708
Man, we dodged the bullet
on that one, didn't we?

27
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,875
Only because Roka lassoed
that one guy into signing up.

28
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:26,125
Huh, what was his name?

29
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,208
The Foot Freak.

30
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,541
The Foot Freak...

31
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,250
Foot Freak,
yeah, that was it!

32
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,708
So how long did they kick him
out of school for, anyway?

33
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,875
Uh... until next week?

34
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,125
He's back mañana.

35
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,125
Huh? No way!

36
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,625
But he's a peeper!

37
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,250
How'm I supposed to sleep
with you yelling all the time?

38
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,750
Oh, Teach, you can
sleep through anything!

39
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,833
Hmm. Do you
think he's gonna

40
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,916
show up for club
meetings or what?

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,583
I don't know for sure,
but I think he's a delinquent.

42
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:58,208
Doesn't really strike me
as the club member type.

43
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,875
Well, he signed his
name on the paper.

44
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,958
That's all I care about. He can
skip out forever if he wants.

45
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,000
[ROKA]
He won't.

46
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,791
One way or the other,
he'll be here.

47
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,583
[ALL THREE]
Uhh...

48
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:17,416
[KAZAMA]
Did you get busted too?

49
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,541
I'm cool with
getting suspended.

50
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,791
I just wish it was for something
I actually did, y'know?

51
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,125
Aw, whatever.

52
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,416
[KAZAMA laughs]

53
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,166
[CAT meows frantically]

54
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,416
[KAZAMA yells]

55
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,166
[KAZAMA] Who the
hell're you guys?

56
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,125
[BLUE MASK] I think he
noticed us! What do we do?

57
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,625
[SMILE MASK] I'm kinda
winging all of this!

58
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,625
[KAZAMA] Wait--matching
costumes, but no plan?

59
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,625
[SMILE MASK] Just grab him!
Yeah, That works!

60
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,875
[ALL THREE]
Right!

61
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,833
[SMILE MASK yells]

62
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,416
Whatever your beef is
with me, bring it on!

63
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,000
[SMILE MASK laughs]

64
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,000
[SMILE MASK]
Now you can never escape!

65
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,333
[BLUE MASK] He's in
our clutches, Prez.

66
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,833
What's our next step?

67
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:01,125
[SMILE MASK] Uh, gimme a sec.
I'm working on it.

68
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,875
Whoa. I think I'm gonna hurl.

69
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,666
[ORANGE NOSE]
Oh, no!

70
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,791
[SMILE MASK pants]

71
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,125
[SMILE MASK]
Too much spinning!

72
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,500
[ORANGE NOSE] Maybe I
should rub her back a bit.

73
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,833
[BLUE MASK] No!
She'll just barf more!

74
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,916
[SMILE MASK]
Haven't barfed yet, thank you!

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,041
[KAZAMA]
I asked you a question!

76
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,125
[SMILE MASK] We are...
the one and only...!

77
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,500
[ORANGE NOSE]
Be strong, Pres!

78
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,375
[KAZAMA] I don't like not
knowin' who I'm dealin' with!

79
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,833
[SMILE MASK]
Huh?

80
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,375
Lose the masks before
I kick your lame asses

81
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,208
into another time zone!

82
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,500
[SMILE MASK]
I'm taking it off!

83
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,708
You're messing with
the Game Creation Club!

84
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:42,791
[KAZAMA] No! Not the
Game Creation Club!

85
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,916
Huh? Wait, you guys aren't them.
I just joined that outfit.

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,791
All you joined were
a bunch of fakers!

87
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,291
Huh? Say what?

88
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,958
Yeah! We're the real
Game Creation Club!

89
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,541
That other group just swiped
our name and ran off with it!

90
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:59,291
[KAZAMA] Augh! I just signed my
life away to those crazy chicks!

91
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,458
No wonder that whole
thing seemed so sketchy!

92
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,500
Man, I got played!

93
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,125
Hey, Sakuragaoka,
is he crying over there?

94
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,333
Like a baby.

95
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,666
It's your chance, Takao!
Go for the jugular!

96
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,125
Perhaps you're right, Inada.

97
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,333
Yeah, tell him what
we expect him to do!

98
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,458
Listen up, you! Quit that
fake club immediately!

99
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,833
[KAZAMA]
Huh?

100
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,291
Once you drop out, those
impostors will get shut down

101
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,750
for lack of members!

102
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:25,125
[KAZAMA] Shut down?
No wonder she was pushy.

103
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,625
So what's your
problem with 'em?

104
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,166
What does it matter to you?

105
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,625
They were already supposed to
be getting shut down anyway!

106
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,791
But some idiot had to
go and mess it all up!

107
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,333
It's not like I wanted to join.

108
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,500
Fine! Then quit!

109
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,875
Get the hell off
my back already!

110
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,291
You're not the boss of me!

111
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,458
I've had enough.
I'm gettin' outta here.

112
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,833
[KAZAMA sighs]

113
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:49,666
[KAZAMA grunts]

114
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,291
Hey!

115
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,291
You're pissin' me off!

116
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,708
You look pretty angry
right now, but still...

117
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,375
you wouldn't hit
a girl, wouldja?

118
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,250
I have complete faith in you!

119
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,833
And I believe that
you'll do the right thing!

120
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,833
[KAZAMA] Yeah, she annoys
the crap outta me!

121
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:06,166
But I'm not down
with punching chicks!

122
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,708
Uh... Hey there.

123
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,166
I don't think that
we've been introduced.

124
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,166
Tell me. Are you really
a girl, or a... dude?

125
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,375
You're so silly!
Of course I'm a girl!

126
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,791
[INADA] Aw, son of a...!

127
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,041
Sakuragaoka looks like
a sweet little princess,

128
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,208
but he's got boy bits down
there! He's a pretty-boy!

129
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,875
No, he's the prettiest boy!

130
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,500
And when he pretends
to be a girl, it's so hot!

131
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,083
But if this Kazama
guy figures out

132
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,833
the truth about our
bishy little gem,

133
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:34,000
he'll knock his beautiful
butt unconscious!

134
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,750
[KAZAMA]
Hmm...

135
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:39,250
You still doubt me.
So be it, then.

136
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,791
Would a boy walk around
in a schoolgirl uniform?

137
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:42,791
[TAKAO &amp; KAZAMA gasp]

138
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,208
[INADA] What?!

139
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,291
He was wearing that under
his robe this whole time?

140
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:51,666
Sakuragaoka. Would you mind
modeling this for me?

141
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,250
Inada, cut it out.

142
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,875
You know I'm not into
that gender-bending stuff.

143
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,500
[INADA] After all my begging,
he finally reveals himself

144
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,541
in a dress.
But not for me! No!

145
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,083
For this... this
hot-headed delinquent!

146
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:08,458
What a betrayal.
But I don't care!

147
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,500
[KAZAMA] Yeah, you're a
chick all right--sorry.

148
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,416
[KAZAMA] Two down, and I still
haven't punched anybody.

149
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,333
What the heck's
going on here, huh?

150
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,666
"What the heck's
going on here?" indeed.

151
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,250
[KAZAMA] Hey! Why're you
freaked out? They're your club!

152
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,375
I'm gonna call it a day.

153
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,750
I knew I forgot one!

154
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,666
Going by your build,
you've gotta be a dude!

155
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,916
[INADA] It's about to
hit the fan, big-time!

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,541
Sure, Yamada may
look like a huge slab

157
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,791
of uncaring testosterone,
but he's actually a big softie!

158
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,916
No way he can pass as a girl!

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,208
Soon as the mask's off,
Kazama's gonna clobber him!

160
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,375
[YAMADA]
Oh, silly-buns.

161
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,083
Of course I'm a girl!

162
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,125
[INADA]
A for effort, big guy!

163
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,500
You think I'd fall for that?

164
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,500
Worth a try!

165
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,583
Well, later.

166
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,458
[TAKAO] Nobody messes
with my club!

167
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm the only one left, so I
guess I'll have to avenge them!

168
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,375
[KAZAMA] Not a good plan.
Seriously. Just don't.

169
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,000
Hey, Prez, I think I'm gonna
have to agree with him.

170
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,666
I agree with her
agreeing with me!

171
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,916
I'm not an idiot, Kazama.
When it comes to sheer strength,

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,791
technique and speed,
your stats outrank mine.

173
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,791
But I've got a cell phone!

174
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,708
One call to the police,

175
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,333
and you're gonna be
in a world of hurt!

176
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,916
[ALL THREE] The cops
are not a summon attack!

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,833
Your truth doesn't sound
as good as my lies.

178
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,750
One of us did just get
suspended for peeping.

179
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,375
Who do you think
they'll side with?

180
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,458
Hey! You can't
pull that crap!

181
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,416
We've got the sullen
ne'er-do-well on one hand,

182
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,250
and on the other,
the super-busty girl.

183
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,625
Huh?

184
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,541
It really is too bad.
If you were into big boobies

185
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,625
instead of feet, the Prez
could have defeated you

186
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,666
with nothing more
than her wobbly wobs!

187

Huh?

188
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,000
Stop right there!

189
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,875
Why the hell do you think
I have a foot fetish?

190
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,208
That is what Ms. Ohsawa
told you, right?

191
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,166
[TAKAO]
Uh, mm-hmm.

192
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,833
He's kind of a foot freak.
That's all I know about him.

193
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,333
[TAKAO]
Copy that!

Damn that teacher to hell!

195
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,375
He likes feet... like that?

196
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,916
What about thighs and ankles?

197
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Do calves do it for you?
Maybe stockings?

198
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,666
You wanna get tied up
in some stockings?

200
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,416
[KAZAMA] Hell, no! I'm not
into feet, okay? I love boobs!

201
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,916
Time out. Did I really
just yell "I love boobs!"

202
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,333
at a bunch of girls?

203
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,166
So what you're saying is...

204
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,708
you'd like to do "you know
what" to the Prez's chest!

205

I never said that! I don't even
know what "you know what" is!

[TAKAO] No! That was

off when they saw us!

310
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,791
[TAKAO gurgles]

311
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,625
[TAKAO] Stop it! I don't
wanna drown in a classroom!

312
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,583
Not gonna get your licks in?

313
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,500
Nah. I'm good.

314
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,416
Jeez, what kind of monster
do you take me for?

315
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,958
[KAZAMA] Lemme get back
to you on that one.

316
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,791
[TAKAO coughs]

317
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,958
Takao, are you all right?

318
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,708
Don't talk to me like
we're still friends,

319
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,541
you little traitor!

320
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:33,750
It sounds like someone is still
nursing a grudge against Roka.

321
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,583
How can you possibly
stay mad at this?

322
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,625
She's too freakin' adorable!

323
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,458
[TAKAO cries]

324
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,791
Enjoy your stupid
fake club while you can!

325
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,875
'Cause I'm shutting
it down ASAP!

326
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,875
[ROKA]
Takao, wait up!

327
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,791
Okay, why do we have
two Game Creation Clubs?

328
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,375
Well, there was some drama.

329
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,041
Between those two,
specifically?

330
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,875
Short version:
Takao hates Roka

331
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,666
for almost breaking up
her Game Creation Club.

332
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,250
How did she do that?

333
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:12,750
Well... Roka was in her club,
back when she was a first-year.

334
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,625
What on earth are you
wearing on your head?

335
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,541
[ROKA] It's a bag.
Would you like to try it?

336
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:24,125
[CHITOSE] Not like it's news
to you, but Roka's a bit unique.

337
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,750
And unique isn't
exactly something

338
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,250
young people are
known for tolerating.

339
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,000
They gave Roka
the cold shoulder.

340
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,166
And when she realized how
weird they thought she was...

341
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,916
That's when the darkness
came out, right?

342
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,958
Guess again. I was so pissed
off, I took care of 'em myself.

343
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,250
[scream]

344
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,958
[CLUB GIRL] The ground
is suffocating me!

345
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,416
[CLUB GUY]
It's cold!

346
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,291
Attendance at the meetings
took a major hit after that.

347
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,583
Roka thought it
was all her fault

348
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:50,958
and she dropped
out of the club.

349
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,875
You're the one
who buried them!

350
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,250
Shut up; there's
more to the story.

351
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,541
[CHITOSE]
Hey, Roka.

352
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:09,166
Whaddya think about making
a new Game Creation Club?

353
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,875
Yeah!

354
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,791
The only thing
I wanted to do

355
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:16,250
was help my best friend Roka
find a way to smile again.

356
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,250
Now that you know what's up,
you have to go after them!

357
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,125
Why is this my
responsibility?

358
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:26,000
Because... I would only make
things weirder. And Sakura...

359
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,708
I'd drown Takao
in a heartbeat!

360
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:28,708
[KAZAMA]
Of course!

361
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:29,708
[CHITOSE]
And Teach is...

362
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,041
[KAZAMA]
Sleeping again?

363
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,708
How do I get myself
into these things?

364
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:40,958
Hmm... I didn't realize this
whole thing was your fault.

365
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,041
[CHITOSE]
Eh...

366
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,041
But if that's
really what happened,

367
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:47,833
why is Takao mad at Roka
instead of being mad at you?

368
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,708
[KAZAMA]
Uhhh...

369
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,833
Real knock-down
drag-out they're havin'.

370
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,916
[TAKAO] You've finally come
to finish me off, huh?

371
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,875
No, I... I just wanted...

372
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,500
All you wanted to do
was give her that towel.

373
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:24,625
Hey! It looks like Roka wants
to apologize. Whaddya say--?

374
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,083
[TAKAO]
Oh, really?

375
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,791
You want to apologize, huh?

376
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,250
I, uh...

377
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:34,458
Well, maybe it's too late
after all this time, okay?

378
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,333
You frustrate me so much!

379
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,166
You didn't even do anything
wrong, but you still

380
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,875
leapt at the chance to quit!
Don't tell me you're sorry!

381
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:45,083
You could've just stayed in
the club with me to begin with!

382
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,750
That's what all
this is about?

383
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,166
[TAKAO whimpers]

384
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,166
[TAKAO] You want a flier
for the Game Creation Club?

385
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:07,750
[TAKAO giggles]

386
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,291
[TAKAO]
Roka!

387
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,166
Some more people joined.

388
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,500
Now we have enough to
enter the tournament.

389
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,000
Wow, that's awesome!

390
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,875
And I know you're going to make
one heck of a game, Takao!

391
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,208
We could--!

392
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,250
[ROKA] Didja hear?
Chitose and I started a club.

393
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,708
I'm a club
president now, too!

394
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,416
[TAKAO] Oh.
You don't say.

395
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,541
Well, best of luck.
I'll see you later!

396
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,458
[TAKAO sniffs]

397
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:42,125
Your club's ridiculous, Roka.

398
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,750
Why do you care
what happens to it?

399
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,041
I put it together
with Chitose.

400
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,458
I can't just let
it get shut down.

401
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,500
Well, how do we move
forward from here?

402
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,125
[TAKAO]
Mm...

403
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
There's no "we"!

404
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,958
My club against yours
at the festival!

405
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,083
If we win, your fake
club is finished!

406
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,791
And my club will absorb
all of your members!

407
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,541
[KAZAMA]
"Absorb"?

408
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,625
Why doesn't she just
say that she wants

409
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,708
to be in the same club?

410
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,000
Man, this chick is stubborn.

411
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,458
What should I tell her?

412
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,791
What do I care?
This isn't my battle!

413
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,583
You're in my club,
aren't you?

414
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,291
I want to know what you
think about all of this.

415
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,125
It's risky, but...

416
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,458
at least then
you might be able

417
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:37,875
to get past all this crap.

418
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:41,125
Right now, you guys are
like a bad soap opera.

419
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,875
Win or lose, at least
it'll get sorted out.

420
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,291
I believe you are right.

421
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:52,375
I accept your challenge.
And may the best club win.

422
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:57,041
Fine. Until then!

423
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,083
Too late for
take-backs, huh?

424
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,125
Yeah. I think it is.

425
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:10,750
So, uh, you think
it's possible...

426
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:14,416
we could win this thing, maybe?

427
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,375
Only one way to find out.

428
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,125
A club duel at the festival?

429
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,208
[SAKURA]
Best idea ever!

430
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,750
Not gonna lie, it sounds
like a whole lotta work.

431
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,291
Hey. How 'bout
a little support?

432
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,875
We gotta win,
'cause if we don't,

433
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,208
our club's gonna get
absorbed into Takao's.

434
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,833
Huh? If that happens,
where'm I gonna nap?

435
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,958
I still can't believe
that someone hired you.

436
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,250
[MINAMI]
Don't judge me.

437
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:42,916
[CHITOSE] Well, it would be
nice to finally settle this.

438
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,083
All we have to do
is beat 'em, right?

439
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,750
Uh-huh.

440
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:52,208
But I'm betting that you've
got something lined up.

441
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,208
So, what's the plan, Roka?

442
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,750
Well...

443
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,500
What if we take
"The Demon King's

444
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,750
Secret Space-Compression
Ritual" and...

445
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,208
And?

446
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,791
[ROKA]
Uh...

447
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,625
The rest is kinda fuzzy.

448
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,291
[KAZAMA] Yeah.
We're toast.

449
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,375
[T &amp; H] Behind
the Scenes Uranium!

450
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,333
Yeah, this sucks.

451
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:53,291
Not feelin' it, huh?
I thought readers would dig

452
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,125
how the meek
protagonist turns into

453
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:58,416
the mysterious Jaguar Potato
to earn cash for the orphans!

454
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,625
I still can't quite figure out

455
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,875
where the story went
off the rails, man!

456
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:04,291
Right when you named
him Jaguar Potato.

457
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,708
Besides, Alive needs
some girl characters.

458
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:08,541
[H] Huh?
But there is one!

459
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:11,750
The leader of the pro-wrestling
underworld, Madam Mariko!

460
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,083
[T] She's a troll!

461
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:15,583
We need to run with
something hip and trendy.

462
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:19,416
Ah! We do a manga about
game design! That is so hip!

463
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,541
[H] Yeah.
Not hip in the slightest.
