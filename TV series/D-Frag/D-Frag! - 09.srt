1
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,166
'Round here, they call me the
Kazama Gang's dump truck,

2
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,666
Yokoshima.

3
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:50,458
I come within inches of the
ceiling even on all fours,

4
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:53,666
earning me the misleading nom de
plume, Long Mountain Nagayama.

5
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,625
The Kazama Gang's
chief of operations,

6
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:58,791
Ataru Kawahara, esquire.

7
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,791
Student Body Vice Pres.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,208
Not to rain on your parade,
but I already know you guys.

9
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,125
Permit me to answer in kind!

10
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,708
I am the illustrious Game
Creation Club (Provisional)'s

11
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,666
very own--wait for it--

12
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,333
Hachi Siou!

13
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,791
So your introductory
spiel was for his benefit?

14
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,458
[KAZAMA] Aw, come on, what the
hell do you think you're doin?

15
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:29,958
Ah! Apologies, friend!

16
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,333
I'm rather enamored
of confined spaces,

17
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,208
particularly when
being scrutinized.

18
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,041
[ATARU laughs]

19
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,208
Y'know, Kenji,

20
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,083
I'm kinda feelin'
this new buddy of yours.

21
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,666
He's not my buddy!

22
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:43,708
But I thought we... I...

23
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:44,750
[KAZAMA] If you
thought anything other than

24
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:46,750
"I am a pain in the
ass," try again.

25
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,583
Not to pry, but,

26
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:53,166
I cannot help but note the
absence of your attaché case.

27
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,166
Huh?

28
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,333
Yeah, I left it
in the classroom.

29
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,125
Completely unacceptable!

30
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,291
Keeping such precious
cargo to yourself!

31
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:02,125
Roka's gym bag deserves
to be put on a pedestal!

32
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,208
How the hell did you know

33
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,083
I'm keeping it
in my briefcase?

34
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,041
[SIOU]
She told me, silly.

35
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:08,875
[KAZAMA]
Of course she did.

36
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,083
Ugh.

37
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:11,875
Just don't read too
much into it, alright?

38
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,166
Very well.

39
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,041
So long as you agree
to show it every respect,

40
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,250
I am content.

41
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,708
If you gentlemen
will excuse me,

42
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:19,791
I've just remembered
something urgent.

43
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,208
Oh yeah,
that was natural!

44
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,083
We all know you're
going for the bag, dude!

45
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:23,833
[SIOU chuckles]

46
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,000
Dear Kazama!

47
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,916
You think me
impervious to honor?

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,291
I lost to you fair and square,

49
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,958
ergo the bag
doesn't belong to me.

50
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,416
Wait, are you serious?

51
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,541
Quite so.

52
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,833
Then again, nothing forbids
me from plunging my head

53
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,833
into your briefcase to
take a generous whiff.

54
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,250
Oh yes it does!
I'm forbidding you,

55
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,291
so leave it alone!

56
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,750
Uh, just a moment, sir.

57
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,250
I allowed you to break
bread with us, but this is...

58
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,708
...well.

59
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,750
Let's just say I'm not the
sort of man to sit idly by.

60
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh no.

61
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,708
If anyone gets to stick
their schnozzola

62
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,541
in Kazama's briefcase, fair play
clearly dictates that first dibs

63
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,541
go to his bestie!

64
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,208
[KAZAMA]
You, too?!

65
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,833
No worries, bro.

66
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,166
Think about it.

67
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,208
A guy trying to cram
his head in there'd be like

68
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,708
stuffing a watermelon
into a duck.

69
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,041
Huh.

70
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,875
You got a point there.
Hear that, ya' jackasses?

71
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,208
Too close for comfort!
That's no fun, right?

72
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,166
You're only making it
sound all the more tantalizing.

73
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,666
[KAZAMA]
What is wrong with you?

74
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,125
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I've got a date with that bag!

75
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:17,541
[ATARU] Consider your precious
briefcase well-protected!

76
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,041
[KAZAMA]
This is gonna be bad.

77
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,666
[ATARU]
Wait for me!

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,500
I'm just sayin', you know?

79
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,583
[SIOU]
Make way!

80
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,666
Sorry! No time to explain;
just keep my briefcase

81
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,375
out of their hands!

82
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,791
Uh, what?

83
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,416
[KAZAMA] This is not a drill!
I'm depending on you!

84
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,875
You're depending on me?

85
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,250
Uh, okay, I'll do what I can!

86
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,416
Really?

87
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm afraid you've
chosen the wrong ally!

88
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,250
[ATARU] As if Funabori has
what it takes to thwart us!

89
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,500
Oh, so you're
teammates now, is that it?

90
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,208
[SIOU] T'was my idea!
I should go first!

91
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,000
--It's only right!
--Hey! That's not how it works!

92
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,583
Funabori! Protect it
with your life, please!

93
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,458
All right!

94
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,291
Is this what you mean?

95
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,583
[KAZAMA] I think you made it
easier for them to reach.

96
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,000
[KAZAMA] Back off,
ya' dill weeds!

97
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,208
[SIOU]
Give it to me at once!

98
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,083
[KAZAMA]
I'm serious, let go of it!

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,250
[KAZAMA] Come on, guys!
It's a briefcase!

100
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,333
You can buy your own!

101
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,291
Oh, crap!
Funabori's about to break!

102
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,625
Leave the poor girl
alone already!

103
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,958
Run, Funabori!

104
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,791
Just chuck the stupid thing
out the damn window!

105
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:19,375
Huh?

106
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,625
But, you...

107
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,083
It's a nice case!

108
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,958
You should be more respectful
of your school supplies!

109
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,833
[KAZAMA] Did--
Did she just get on to me?

110
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:27,750
Ugh! Fine! Whatever!

111
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,083
Just hide it or something, then!

112
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,833
I... I wouldn't know
the first place.

113
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,250
[FUNABORI]
Think! He's counting on you!

114
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,416
Somewhere guys don't
have easy access to.

115
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,041
Look, I'm not tryin'
to rush you here,

116
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,333
but the natives are restless.

117
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,666
Uh, yeah.

118
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,375
Shakin' your head like
that isn't really helping.

119
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,625
My head, huh?

120
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,541
Copy that loud and clear!

121
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,500
Shielding mode engaged!

122
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,208
[KAZAMA]
What the hell?

123
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,416
[FUNABORI]
There!

124
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Now no one would dare
touch your briefcase

125
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,750
because I just
stuffed my head in it!

126
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,250
Wow it's super dark in here.

127
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,666
If someone were to
yank it off, it would hurt.

128
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,166
Like really bad.

129
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,125
But that's okay!

130
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,500
'Cause I trust you guys!

131
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,208
I know that Ataru and Siou
would never do anything

132
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,833
to hurt me on
purpose, right?

133
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,416
[ATARU]
Well played, Funabori!

134
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,791
You've won this round!

135
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,666
[KAZAMA]
Wait, it actually worked?

136
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,666
[SIOU chuckles]

137
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,041
[SIOU]
My dear.

138
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,958
You are the champion
of cramped spaces!

139
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:34,125
[FUNABORI] Was--
Was that sarcastic, or...?

140
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,958
Hey, are you all right?

141
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,083
[FUNABORI]
I don't know.

142
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,541
[NOE]
"Provisional"?

143
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,458
You're kidding me.

144
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,541
Why would he join a club with
a lame-o name like that?

145
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,125
[ROKA] Care to join me
for a spot of tea, Takao?

146
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,666
I'd love to, but I really
need to get to my own club.

147
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,958
I can't even tempt
you with a macaroon?

148
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,708
Well, I...

149
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:26,958
maybe I could.

150
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,125
Okay, whose little eyeball keeps
peeping into our clubroom?

151
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,750
Here, take a seat.

152
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,291
Would you like some tea?

153
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,458
Stuff your face?

154
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,583
[NOE] Red alert!
They're baiting me!

155
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,125
[CHITOSE] This is
our advisor, by the way.

156
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,166
[NOE]
What?

157
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,500
Don't I know you?

158
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,125
You're a first year
student, right?

159
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,416
Uh, that's me! Yeah!

160
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,083
I can't place it, but
you look kinda' familiar.

161
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,166
[NOE] I'm talking to the
Student Body President!

162
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,166
And she's just like Ogawa said!

163
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,791
Take my word for it, girlfriend,

164
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,666
that Karasuyama chick
is the coolest president

165
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,166
this school's ever had.

166
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,625
[NOE] But why is she slumming
in a nerd cave like this?

167
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,875
Your hair is ringing
some serious bells.

168
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,083
So you're a first year?

169
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,333
There's no need to worry.

170
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,458
We're rather big fans
of cute and small.

171
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,666
[NOE]
Who you talkin' to,

172
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,583
Miss Four-Foot-Nothin'
Blondie Brown Eyes?

173
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,625
That hair.

174
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,791
[NOE] Okay, why are
you freaking out?

175
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,750
You didn't even touch my hair!

176
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,708
Mmm-hmm.
That explains it.

177
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,166
Uh, what's going on?

178
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,583
Apparently, spiky hair
runs in the family.

179
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,250
Not gonna lie, I always
assumed he dyed it.

180
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,125
Yes, well it's conceivable
they just use the same dye.

181
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,083
[NOE] Ew!
We don't share product!

182
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:02,833
Hey, guys?

183
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,041
Uh, clue me in, please.

184
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,291
She's...

185
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,083
[CHITOSE]
You guessed it.

186
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,541
That's his Little Sister.

187
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,458
Wait, what?
Little sister?

188
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,791
Kazama never mentioned
anything about this to me!

189
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:19,958
Are the two of you
close enough

190
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,625
that'd you feel
entitled to know?

191
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,625
Hey!

192
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:23,791
What's he to you,
Fanny Funpacks?

193
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,625
[TAKAO]
Nothing! Nothing, I swear!

194
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,041
Not that it's a competition,
but I already knew.

195
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,041
Everybody just needs
to back off, okay?

196
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,208
Putting your hands in my hair
like this is a petting zoo.

197
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,916
How'd you like it if
someone touched your hair

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,125
and was all weird?

199
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,375
Maybe I'm sensitive
about how spiky it is!

200
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,625
All right?

201
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,000
I--I'm really sorry.

202
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,666
And the way you just assume
we're brother and sister

203
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,083
'cause of our hair!

204
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,041
If you're basing it on spiky,
maybe she's a relative!

205
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,708
She looks like she's wearing a
friggin' porcupine on her head!

206
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,541
To be totally honest, I think
being Kazama's Little Sister

207
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:56,750
would be pretty awesome.

208
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,333
Okay, It's kinda' creepy
for you to say that

209
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,500
while you're
brushing your hair!

210
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,666
Was that bed head?

211
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,375
--That's impressive.
--That's impressive.

212
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,250
[NOE] You've never
seen her like that before?

213
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,375
Good call, Ogawa.
This one's amazing, too.

214
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,458
I'm tellin' ya,
look out for Mizukami.

215
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,541
She'll turn your world upside
down with how amazing she is.

216
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,000
[NOE]
Why is she here, then?

217
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,041
Is this club just
a front or something?

218
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,416
Like it's really a
lair for the cool kids?

219
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,666
[NOE] I couldn't get my
head around why big bro

220
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,416
would join an outfit like this.

221
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,833
But with all the big shots here,
I guess it makes sense.

222
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,583
I think. Maybe.

223
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,333
[ROKA]
Excuse me, Little Sis?

224
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,083
Huh? Did you...?

225
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,750
So tell us what kind
of things you're into.

226
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,000
Uh, 'kay,
out of left field.

227
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,916
You mean, like, people or...

228
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,833
Like your brother?

229
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,666
Ugh! That's so gross!

230
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,958
I, uh, like...

231
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,583
...ice cream! Yeah!

232
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,208
Oh, okay!

233
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,416
So you draw your power
from an ice elemental!

234
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,041
[NOE]
I'm sorry, do what now?

235
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,125
Ice Type, say hello
to Water Type.

236
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,791
Maybe we really are
relatives after all, huh?

237
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,666
[NOE] Is this some kind of
a screening process,

238
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,333
or is she just nuts?

239
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,166
So how do you
feel about water?

240
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,791
Uh... I dunno.

241
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,208
I guess it's cool or whatever;

242
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,583
I haven't really
thought about it.

243
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,500
What are your feelings
on earth-based magic?

244
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,458
You like dirt?

245
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,250
Uh... Same as water,
I s'pose.

246
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,458
We'd be screwed without it.

247
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,750
I see. And what are
your feelings on fire?

248
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,625
Well, we need it
to cook and stuff, so--

249
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,541
What the hell's with all
these weird questions?

250
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,916
So what about games?
You appreciate those?

251
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,958
Okay, that one
was halfway normal!

252
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,125
[ALL] You can tell
she's Kazama's sister

253
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,125
by the way she
flubs a punch line.

254
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,708
Well, she's a fan of water!

255
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,916
[NOE] Why do I feel
like I'm in a sideshow tent?

256
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,416
If I don't make a
break for it soon,

257
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,000
they'll infect me
with their crazy.

258
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:44,375
[phone ringing]

259
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,208
Hey. Yeah, I know.

260
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,666
Sorry, I got caught
up in something;

261
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,666
I'm going to be late.

262
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,875
[ROKA]
Whoa!

263
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,458
Excuse me, but is that
what I think it is?

264
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,583
[TAKAO]
Huh?

265
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:54,583
[ROKA] When did you
get a phone strap

266
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,458
of Mason riding
Endgar the dolphin

267
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,625
from the Magical Village game?

268
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,333
[ROKA] That's a limited
edition item, special ordered

269
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,041
by the manager
of Virtual Poi!

270
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,833
I happen to know this
because I was camping out

271
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,083
in line when the
latest version of

272
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,375
the game went on sale.

273
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,125
And yet I don't recall
seeing you there.

274
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,833
Which is more than a little odd,

275
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,083
especially given
that Kazama was.

276
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,958
[TAKAO]
I am so busted!

277
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,541
Hold on a second.

278
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,791
Since when is Mr. Attitude the
type to wait in line for a game?

279
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,250
Not really his style.

280
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,583
[ROKA]
But... he was there.

281
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,083
I saw him.

282
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,500
He was dressed up
in a Mason cosplay.

283
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,208
I'm calling shenanigans!

284
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,500
No. Just no!

285
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,666
Believe me!

286
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,208
Now that I think of it,
his wizard's cloak

287
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,083
was really well-made.

288
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,083
No!

289
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,750
And when pressed,
he cast a spell.

290
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:38,791
Fire Archer!

291
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:39,916
What?

292
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,041
That better not be
code for something!

293
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,500
You're freaking me out here!

294
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,166
[ROKA] But he didn't want
to cast Cold Freezer,

295
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,333
which I find weird,
considering that his own sister

296
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,291
is an ice-type.

297
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,250
That would've been so cool.

298
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,875
[NOE] Look, I don't know how
well you think you know him,

299
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,833
but there's no way we're
talkin' about the same Kazama!

300
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:54,916
[TAKAO]
Oh, dear.

301
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,125
This is escalating quickly.

302
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,208
Should I save the
poor guy's reputation,

303
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,625
or bring on Roka's wrath
by admitting he and I

304
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,000
waited in line together?

305
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,083
She won't believe
it was innocent.

306
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,125
Oh!

307
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,333
[TAKAO]
Of course!

308
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,291
There's a perfectly good
explanation why your brother

309
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,291
was outside a game store
in wizard cosplay.

310
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,000
He owed me a favor
and I cashed in on it

311
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,791
by ordering him to wait
in line on my behalf!

312
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,833
You did what?

313
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,166
[TAKAO]
On second thought,

314
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,583
perhaps I should have
said "requested" instead.

315
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,291
You know, thinking
back, he did mention

316
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,416
on more than one occasion
owing you big-time.

317
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,291
So you had him pony up
for the game, huh?

318
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,916
Yes! Exactly!

319
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,166
Works for me.

320
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,958
Nice touch making him
put on the wizard getup.

321
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,166
Bet he secretly loved it!

322
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,791
Eh? Well, possibly,

323
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,458
but it was on my command!

324
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,541
Wait, so you're saying
that he only cast that

325
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,166
awesome Fire Archer spell
because you ordered him to?

326
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,666
Right! Yes!

327
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,416
No point cosplaying 'less
you give it a hundrend 'n ten.

328
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,000
Point being it was all me.

329
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,791
Otherwise he wouldn't be caught
dead doing something like that.

330
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,750
[TAKAO] Ha! Reputations
saved all the way around.

331
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,000
[TAKAO] Uh, then again,
it might be kinda difficult

332
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,041
to respect a Big Brother
when you think he allows

333
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,333
a girl to tell him
what to do.

334
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,583
Great, now I look
like a total witch.

335
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,166
[NOE]
Who is this chick?

336
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,625
Bro doesn't let himself get
pushed around by anybody,

337
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,708
but somehow she's got him
around her little finger?

338
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:10,916
What's with that?

339
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,083
Wait.

340
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,375
There's a girl named Takao

341
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,083
that puts the rest
of 'em to shame.

342
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,791
Make no mistake, that
one's got assets for days.

343
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,250
Ogawa didn't just
talk her up;

344
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,000
she made hand
motions in the air!

345
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,583
I'm in the presence of royalty!

346
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,625
Hey there.
Are you okay?

347
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:27,666
Don't be scared.

348
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,916
[NOE]
No. Divinity!

349
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,666
Uh, still with us?
You seem shell-shocked.

350
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,833
I can't handle all
this amazing!

351
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,083
[squeals]

352
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,166
Don't come any closer, please!
I'm not worthy!

353
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,500
[whimpering]

354
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,666
[ROKA]
Little Sister, no!

355
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,291
[SAKURA] She hit the bookcase
hard enough to knock down

356
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,083
both volumes of I Love!

357
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,291
I--I'm so sorry!

358
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:05,875
Ow! Brother, help!

359
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:07,791
[ALL]
Oh, crap.

360
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,708
Boobs McGee attacked
me with her assets!

361
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,625
No! I used my hands!
I swear I did!

362
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,583
--She called you Boobs McGee.
--She called you Boobs McGee.

363
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,625
Don't get any ideas.

364
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,333
A nickname like that'll
never stick!

365
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,666
Boobs McGee, huh?

366
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,916
[TAKAO]
Go back to sleep!

367
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,958
[NOE]
Kenji...

368
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,458
Kenji, I...

369
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,250
[KAZAMA]
Noe? What's going on?

370
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,166
You only talk to me in public
when something's wrong.

371
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,458
I, uh, might've sorta
gone and checked out

372
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,875
your little club.

373
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,708
[NOE] We walked home
together that day.

374
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,250
In total silence.

375
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,833
And I got treated
to the fanciest

376
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,708
convenience store ice
cream that money could buy.

377
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,000
[NOE]
Gimme a break, Kenji.

378
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,791
Why should I bother
making you a lunch

379
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,916
if you're just
gonna forget it? Ugh.

380
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm sorry.
Yesterday was--

381
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,958
[NOE]
Please forgive me!

382
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,875
It was super rude of me
to call you that name!

383
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,166
I wasn't thinking!

384
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,916
What are the chances of
running into this girl

385
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,666
twice in two freakin' days?

386
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,333
Am I cursed?

387
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,416
[TAKAO] Oh. The poor thing
must be terrified of me.

388
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,000
Not that I blame her,
all things considered.

389
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,208
No.

390
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,333
Yesterday was just a
big misunderstanding.

391
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:46,000
Uh, can you look at me?

392
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,250
The whole thing
was my fault!

393
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,458
I didn't mean to
grab your boobs.

394
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,916
--I'm sorry!
--Whoa!

395
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,666
To be honest though, it's
amazing how bouncy they are,

396
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,000
I mean--

397
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,083
Bouncy?

398
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,916
Well yeah,
didn't you see 'em?

399
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,541
Could you please
shut your face?

400
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,458
I mean, use your inside voice?

401
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,083
[NOE]
Sorry again.

402
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,583
I don't know how to explain it.

403
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:07,416
I guess I was just
scar--uh, shaken up.

404
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,583
Oh, come on!

405
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,125
There's no reason
for you to be scared.

406
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,208
[NOE]
I'm dying.

407
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,625
This is so awkward.

408
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,791
I blame you, Big Brother.
What am I supposed to do?

409
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,541
I don't have a reason
to be scared?

410
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,416
Then again, she is kinda cute.

411
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,458
And who am I kidding,
those things are awesome.

412
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,166
And apparently full of crazy.

413
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,458
I need to get the
hell out of here.

414
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,125
Thank you for talking to
me, but I've gotta go now.

415
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,541
Ah. I see.

416
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,291
Well, take it easy.

417
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,500
Maybe we can do lunch
together sometime?

418
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,916
[NOE]
And... you're out!

419
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,166
[NOE]
Not to sound ungrateful,

420
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,083
but why would you wanna
eat lunch with me?

421
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,125
Uh, seriously?

422
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,166
Uh...

423
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,083
No particular
reason, really.

424
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,791
I just figured it'd be nice of
me to make an effort

425
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,333
since we got off on
the wrong foot and all.

426
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,000
There're no ulterior motives
involved, I swear!

427
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,958
[NOE]
Ulterior motives?

428
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,541
Why is she so nervous?

429
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:02,875
This seems kinda sketchy.

430
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,333
What does this amazing girl
want to do with me?

431
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,250
Uh, so like I said,
I've gotta go.

432
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,000
Kenji was a doofus
and left his bento box

433
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,666
on the kitchen counter.

434
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,041
[NOE]
Well played.

435
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,333
Thanks for giving me an
excuse to avoid her, Kenji.

436
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:19,208
Even though it is your fault
I'm in this mess to begin with.

437
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,791
Ah, I understand.

438
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,125
Well, that's... yeah.

439
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:26,833
Maybe it wouldn't hurt to ask

440
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,041
if he'd be interested
in joining us?

441
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,458
[NOE] Is she asking me and
my brother out on a date?

442
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,916
What a freak!

443
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,166
Yeah, no.

444
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,041
It'd be kinda awkward to
eat with him at school.

445
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,583
One of those
brother-sister things?

446
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:38,958
Besides, I'd just hold you up.

447
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,291
I left my lunch
back in the classroom.

448
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,708
It doesn't have to be
today; any time is good.

449
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,041
You know, I could take
his bento box to him for you

450
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,625
so you don't have
to go back and forth!

451
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,833
See, I'm in the classroom next
to his, so it'd be convenient.

452
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,375
Hello there.

453
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,083
You recognize this, I trust?

454
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,916
That's right, I took it
from your sister.

455
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,666
Who, I might add,
is a pushover.

456
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,583
Oh yeah, I took the
liberty of mixing things up.

457
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,125
Eat every last bite, now!
Don't wanna waste protein!

458
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,625
And you can only use your mouth!

459
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,541
Please help me,
Big Brother.

460
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,791
I'm frightened and I
don't know what to do.

461
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,541
[TAKAO] What's wrong?
What happened?

462
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,625
Did I miss something?

463
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:22,791
Uh...

464
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:23,625
[ROKA]
No!

465
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,125
Step back, foul Takao!

466
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,541
I will not allow you to
harass my baby sister!

467
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,625
What? No one's
harassing anyone!

468
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,041
Somehow you have
managed to petrify

469
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,000
she with the
strongest of wills!

470
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,625
There's more to you
than meets the eye!

471
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:38,666
Gulp!

472
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,916
[TAKAO] Stop looking
at me like that!

473
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,541
I didn't do anything!

474
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,791
[ROKA]
A likely story!

475
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,333
I condemn thee, Takao Thunder!

476
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,125
--Takao Thunder!
--[TAKAO] Don't try to turn

477
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,166
--Takao Thunder!
--my name into an incantation!

478
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:53,583
Takao Thunder!

479
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,875
I really like where
this is headed.

480
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,208
What's wrong
with you people?

481
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,166
I just offered to take
Kazama's bento box to him

482
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,875
so his sister wouldn't have
to go to the trouble!

483
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,041
Where's the crime in that?

484
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,416
[ROKA]
Oh.

485
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,791
Well I have the perfect
solution to this conundrum.

486
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,291
I'll deliver the box
to him myself.

487
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,875
[TAKAO]
There is no "conundrum!"

488
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,083
Um, I'm thinkin'
I overreacted.

489
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:14,125
Maybe Roka should, I mean, one
of you should take it to him.

490
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,666
[TAKAO]
Wait.

491
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,791
Did she just let it slip that
she'd prefer Roka to do it?

492
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:18,875
[ROKA]
My pleasure.

493
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,791
It's in good hands, Sis.

494
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,958
Hey, who the heck
do you think you are?

495
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,458
I offered to take it first!

496
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,625
She clearly said either
one of us could take it!

497
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,291
[TAKAO] That may very well be,
but you sandbagged me!

498
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,625
Sandbagged?

499
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,000
Are you that desperate
to pilfer Kazama's lunch?

500
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,583
[TAKAO]
I'm not pilfering it!

501
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,958
I'm dropping it off out of the
goodness of my heart, honest!

502
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:40,958
Then don't let me stop you!

503
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,500
It's not fair, you can't--

504
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,708
Did you feel that, my son?

505
00:20:58,791 --> 00:20:59,708
Yeah!

506
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,083
It came from all
the way back home!

507
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,583
[ROKA]
No!

508
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:05,666
[TAKAO]
What have I done?

509
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,750
[ROKA]
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

510
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:08,625
You know what?

511
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:09,958
Forget about the whole thing.

512
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,208
To tell you the truth,
I'm relieved it spilled.

513
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,500
--Relieved?
--Relieved?

514
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,541
Oh, dear. Look at it.

515
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,458
And you went to all the
trouble to make him lunch.

516
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:20,916
[NOE]
It's no big deal.

517
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,750
He'll manage one way or another.
He always does.

518
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,375
I'd offer my bento box
to make up for it, except,

519
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,125
as luck would have it,
I was a moron

520
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,958
and left mine on the
kitchen counter this morning.

521
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,000
[NOE]
Coincidence?

522
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,166
[TAKAO]
Here.

523
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,833
The pastry I was
going to eat instead.

524
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,583
Take it. It's the
least I could do.

525
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,750
[NOE]
Huh?

526
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,375
Well, uh... I'm sure
he'll appreciate it.

527
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,458
She's really going
to give this to him?

528
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,416
She might actually be nice.

529
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,708
[ROKA]
We must ask ourselves

530
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,791
whether such a petty
offering will appease him.

531
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,666
He is a growing boy.

532
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,500
This will only make
his appetite angry!

533
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,666
Then what do you
think we should do?

534
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,583
We must also give him
this bento box.

535
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,208
Originally crafted for me,

536
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:03,041
by the youngest member
of my family.

537
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,875
[NOE]
How considerate!

538
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:07,166
[TAKAO] The sacrifice
is making her tremble!

539
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,083
She sure is
taking her time.

540
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,583
[NOE]
Uh, hey, Bro.

541
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:14,625
Here y'go.

542
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,083
The hell's with
the entourage?

543
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:17,583
[ROKA]
Farewell!

544
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:18,750
What the...?

545
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:19,875
Hey, what're doing
hanging out with them?

546
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,666
Fine, whatever.

547
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,708
Be weird.

548
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:28,541
[KAZAMA] "Big Sister, I love
you"? And there's a heart?

549
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:31,750
The leader of the Kazama
Gang goes by "Big Sister"?

550
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:32,958
Why would that be
the first thing

551
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,375
that popped
in your heads?

552
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,541
[CHITOSE]
So,

553
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,958
Anything interesting
happen today?

554
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:15,458
[ROKA]
Hey, Kazama?

555
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:18,250
I need my bento
box back, please!

556
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,208
You think you did me
a favor, huh?

557
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,750
[TAMA]
The notorious Kenji Kazama.
