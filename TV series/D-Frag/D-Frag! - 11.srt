I'll be the referee.

supposed to be?

He's famous for taking
the middle ground, dude.

What, were you born yesterday?

00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:06,375
Quite.

00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,000

[FUJISAKI] Heh.

11
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,375
[FUJISAKI] Ever since you
defeated me at the Bag Scramble,

12
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,000
I've gotten much
closer to achieving

the ideal of true
fifty-fifty impartiality.

So, thanks.
I owe ya.

15
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,083
[KAZAMA] Okay.

16
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,833
No clue what you're
talkin' about.

17
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,041
That's, nice and all.

18
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,833
But, uh, do we even
have a game picked out?

As it happens, I have
something in mind.

23
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,000
Step one: using the
notepad-slash-memo screen

24
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,541
of your phone, type a question.

25
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:41,875
Interesting. Then?

26
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,125
Well, once the timer starts,

27
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:46,000
the object is to steal
your opponents' phone.

28
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,875
That done, you answer the
question entered in their

29
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,875
memo screen and fire it off
to the referee for appraisal.

30
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,083
That's me!

[dinging]

32
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:56,250

Guess wrong,
play a penalty game.

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,208
It'll be four on four,
the team that still has a member

standing when the
smoke clears, wins.

The entire school will
be our playing field.

Oh, I'm likin' this.

42
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:15,375
Quick question.

43
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,458
Is assault a regulation
move for nabbing a phone?

44
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,250
Uh. No, not exactly!

45
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,291
Fairly straightforward
rules of conduct.

Yeah! I'm a big fan
of the full-contact,

this game on tag!

Do not, I repeat:
do not consider it

Don't worry,

for personal boundaries.

Hey, at the end of the day,
it's not the cash we're after.

It's the look on their faces

you to look after Roka.

from all of a sudden?

wouldn't recover in time.

as long as I could.

just away from here.

I've got to take care of.

to Peggy Pigtails, don't they?

have fun every now and then.

do what she says.

y'know, can't complain.

122

[CHITOSE]
Oh, is that a fact?

123
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,750
We're the unimportant side
characters this time, huh?

and have some faith!

[SAKURA] Huh?

126
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,416
We're cleverly
taking a back seat

127
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,333
until we can storm the climax.

128
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:33,416
Look at yourself.

129
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,833
You're in no shape
to storm anything.

130
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:39,333
Not to worry,
I have a strategy!

131
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,916
Depending on the method
by which I'm carried,

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,333
my recovery speed
significantly varies.

The Princess Carry!

134
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,666
Personally, I recommend
Number Three,

135
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,916
as that's the only fool-proof
method among our options.

136
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,333
Yeah, I think a piggyback
ride will be just fine!

Hey Kazama. Are you
taking this seriously?!

Indeed they do.

142
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,208
Let us hope I recuperate
quickly for Chitose's sake.

[KAZAMA grunts]

144
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,125
Actually, I could
get used to this.

145
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,708
If only time might stop
whilst I'm in your arms!

146
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,083
Well that was quite
the turn around,

147
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,958

drained or whatever...

Utterly sapped, yes.

If you're tryin'
to play me,

of the first window I see!

'Kay, I'll drop her off
at the nurse's office

152
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,791
and come right back.
Are you sure about this?

153
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,000
[CHITOSE chuckles]

154
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,583
Come on, who do you
think you're talkin' to?

155
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,250
Get back as fast as you can.

156
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,083
[CHITOSE and TAMA]
Hmm?

[TAKAO sighs]

158
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,041
[CHITOSE]
An innocent young maiden

159
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,000
abandoned on the battlefield!

160
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,750
[TAMA] That makes things
more challenging.

161
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,416
But regardless.

00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
[CHITOSE and TAMA]
She's goin' down!

163
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,166

the game begins, girls.

166
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,833
Uh. Hi, Inada?

[TAKAO gasps]

168
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,125
Aw, yeah! This'll be
Ataru's big moment!

169
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,750
[TAKAO]
Where did he come from?

170
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,458
Uh, seven minutes,
actually. So...

171
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,625
[KAZAMA] Heads up,
Funabori! Comin' through!

172
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,208
[FUNABORI] Kazuma?

173
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:17,541
[ROKA]
Emergency med pack. Excellent.

174
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,791
[SAKURA] Delicious!

175
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,500
Hey!

176
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:24,958
Sorry, pal.

177
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,333
This hallway's closed
for destruction.

178
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,916
[KAZAMA] What?
Wait, you're that...!

179
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,250
Uh... Who're you again?

180
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,125
Odawara of the Band
of Fourteen Devils!

181
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,583
There was a whole
episode about us!

182
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,583
I'm the leader.

183
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,625
[KAZAMA]
Not these guys!

184
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,083
I thought there were
more of 'em last time.

185
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,166
[ODAWARA] Tama opened
the arcades up to us again

186
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,083
after we was banned.

187
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,458
So me an' my posse got
a dog in this fight!

188
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,458
[BAND OF 14 DEVILS]
Hell yeah!

189
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,083
How much clout does this
Tama chick actually have?

190
00:08:56,166 --> 00:09:00,041
And like I said, this hall's
closed for destruction!

191
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,208
[KAZAMA] Dudes, the game
hasn't even started yet!

192
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,250
Game? Heh.

193
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,083
No idea what you're
talkin' about.

194
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,708
We're just a bunch of guys
hanging out in a random hallway,

195
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,041
doin' our thing.

196
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,416
Damn, why's he gotta
play it like that?

197
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,416
Even if my hands were free,
I couldn't take all of 'em on.

198
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,083
Why didn't I
bring more water?

199
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,666
These idiots
wouldn't be an issue

200
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,333
if I was properly hydrated.

201
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,666
[KAZAMA grunts]

202
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,458
[SIOU] And I suppose, in the
grand scheme of things,

203
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,750
we're chopped liver?

204
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,208
[KAZAMA and SAKURA] Ah!

205
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,125
[KAZAMA]
What the hell?

206
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,666
[SIOU chuckles]

207
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,083
You are only allowed to look
after Roka by my dispensation.

208
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,708
You want we should
take care of these jerks?

209
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,500
We got more than enough
members handle 'em now.

210
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,375
[KAZAMA] Whoa!
Where'd they come from?

211
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,916
[GUYS yell]

212
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,291
[YOKOSHIMA groans]

213
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,875
[KAZAMA] I don't wanna seem
ungrateful for the help

214
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,125
or anything, but the number
of dudes in here right now

215
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,500
makes it kinda
uncomfortable.

216
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,541
[SIOU yells]

217
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,583
[SIOU] Go, Kazama!
Eye of the needle!

218
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,166
[ODAWARA grunts]

219
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,541
[SIOU] Ah! Oh, my.

220
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:13,541
I absolutely love cramped
spaces, how about you?

221
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,875
Well, have a ball.

222
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,666
[FUJISAKI] We're now lookin' at
three minutes 'til Cell Thieves.

223
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,750
It's not exactly easy
to run like this.

224
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,333
I believe in you!

225
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,541
Fight it, Kazama!

226
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,625
[KAZAMA]
Knock it off!

227
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,041
[SAKURA] I don't wanna
add any pressure,

228
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,041
but we're running out of time
before the game starts!

229
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,458
Let's look at
this logically,

230
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,333
Chitose's got our biggest
threat on lockdown, right?

231
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,791
So why are we even that worried?

232
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,625
She handles Tama,
we handle the others,

233
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,208
easy peezy, nice an' sleazy.

234
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,791
I wish it was as
straightforward as that.

235
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:49,916
Do what?

236
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,166
Though admittedly
not much to look at,

237
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,583
the ex-Student Council
types are formidable.

238
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,916
Yeah, well you'll have to
forgive me if I'm not seein' it.

239
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,333
I think a quick rundown of the
Third Years we're up against

240
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,916
is in order.

241
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,750
First up, we have the
ex-Treasurer, Azuma Matsubara.

242
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,166
Flawless grade-point average,

243
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,416
Possibly Fujuo's
smartest student ever.

244
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,625
Let that sink in.

245
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,166
[GUYS] Ever? Ever?

246
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,791
[ROKA] She excels in sports,
and has high moral standards.

247
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,416
She's not gonna
be easy to beat.

248
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,791
[KAZAMA] Oh, gimme a break.
Nobody's that perfect.

249
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,125
[ROKA] Next, we have
ex-Vice President Naganuma.

250
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:23,166
Undisputed heavyweight anime
expert, prides himself on

251
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,375
watching all the late-night
titles as they air.

252
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,375
Incidentally walks around
with his eyes closed,

253
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,666
or half-closed, at least--

254
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,791
to balance out the
corresponding sleep deficit.

255
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,875
[KAZAMA] Wait, he's
an otaku? That guy?

256
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,625
I thought he was just a dork!

257
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,791
[ROKA] We're also dealing
with ex-Clerk, Shinsen,

258
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,875
a.k.a. Barfy.

259
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:43,250
According to legend, she vomits
acid, acid quite possibly able

260
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,000
to melt through to
the earth's core.

261
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,458
[KAZAMA] Not to ruin
your exposition,

262
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:49,041
but we need to talk about
the order of these pictures.

263
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,916
Anyway, what I'm
takin' from all this

264
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,291
is that we just need
to be on our guard.

265
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,625
[MASON]
Fire Archer! Fire--

266
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,041
It's been ten minutes,
the game is afoot!

267
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,041
[MATSUBARA] Then let
us begin, shall we?

268
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,500
[KAZAMA] Hm?

269
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,958
You kind of announced
yourself there

270
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,541
before launching
your first strike.

271
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,291
I suddenly have a lot
of respect for you.

272
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,083
Nice form.

273
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,583
I'm a very giving person.

S'pose that's enough
beatin' around the bush?

276
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,750
Let's get on
with it then.

277
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,000

[TAKAO] Huh?!
Why did you pick up?

286
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,625
Never mind, we've got problems,

You two make a run for it,
I've got you covered!

291
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,666
Get Roka somewhere
out of harm's way

292
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,500
and hightail it back to
the classroom, STAT,

293
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,416
Chitose's gonna need
all the help she can get!

00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,125
Uh, right!

295
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,500
You don't think the Prez is
in that much of a bind, do ya?

296
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,750
I mean, she seemed so confident
'bout keepin' Tama in check.

297
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,541
One has to wonder.

298
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,916
Huh?! Her defensive
measures are unprecedented!

299
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,500
You really know how to
take a beating, Ataru.

300
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,208
Do we need to call someone?

[ATARU groans]

302
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,041
Wasn't there an old proverb
about true diamonds

303
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,541
never breaking, or something?

304
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,916
Oh, I didn't realize that's
what we were going for here.

305
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,041
I bet that I can break him
with a couple more hits.

306
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,208
I, uh...

307
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,250
I hate to be that girl,
but is this legal?

308
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,750
We agreed the game
would be four on four.

309
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,208
While technically
she's using him

310
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,208
as last-minute addition
to the team.

311
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,666
Well, as a shield.

312
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,625
He's allowed!

with you guys for anything.

[bones crack]

318
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,375
I'm sorry, man.

319
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,416
The rules of engagement
forbid me from showing mercy.

320
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,833
[KAZAMA]
Damn, he's good.

321
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,083
Look at him.
You can just tell.

322
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,583
I have a soft spot, though.

323
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,000
Voice actresses and girls who
sound like voice actresses

324
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,333
all get a pass from me.

325
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm not a machine!

326
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,833
[KAZAMA]
Okay, I take it back.

327
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,291
You're up a creek, pal!

328
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,916
But the girls pose
a problem for me,

329
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,250
they both sound like they
could easily dub anime.

330
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,458
Even now I can imagine them

331
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,458
voicing some of my
favorite characters!

332
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,791
Real fans always go sub!!

333
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,291
Oh, you.

334
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,500
Don't encourage this jackass!

335
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,875
[SAKURA] Ah!

336
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,000
Nice moves!

337
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,666
You haven't seen
anything yet.

338
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,250
[NAGANUMA] Oh! Get a grip, dude!
They're nobodies.

339
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,125
These girls are just normal
high school students.

340
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,083
They aren't voice actresses.

341
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,916
They just sound like it.

342
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,333
Are you ready to go?

343
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,291
[NAGANUMA sobs]

344
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,833
[KAZAMA] What is
wrong with people?

345
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,166
Hey, uh...

346
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,833
We should grab this dude's
cell while he's down.

347
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,500
That is the whole
point of the game.

348
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,750
That might just be exactly
what he wants you to think!

349
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,250
Moments like this call
for the utmost care!

350
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,291
Besides, to engage him
you'd have to put me down,

351
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,000
and we all know any
tactic involving that

352
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,166
would be patently reckless!

353
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,125
You must cling to me
no matter the cost!

354
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,875
Yeah, I'm puttin' ya down.

355
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,291
[ROKA]
Are you listening to me?

356
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,708
Look, my arms have taken
just about all they can stand.

357
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,000
You mustn't lose heart!

358
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,916
Heave to! The fight
has only just begun!

359
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,500
Since when is me
continuing to hold you

360
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,041
our entire game strategy?

361
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,250
You're making the girl feel
self-conscious about her weight.

362
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,750
Not cool, my friend.

363
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,291
[KAZAMA] How are you
chewin' me out and fighting

364
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,458
at the same time?

365
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,958
Take it from me, Kazama.

366
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,000
Girls are light!

367
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,583
[KAZAMA]
Not all of em'!

368
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,833
You're incredible, of all the
times to squander one's energy

369
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,166
on insensitive, chauvinistic
attempts at humor!

370
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,500
[KAZAMA] I'm not
trying to be funny!

371
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:04,375
Never mind! Let's just
get the hell out of here!

[NAGANUMA laughs]

373
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,958
You've abandoned your friend
to a fate worse than death!

374
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,541
Ha! Two against one!

00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,291
C'mon, big brother Naganuma.

376
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,125
We both know you could never
bring yourself to stoop so low!

377
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,333
[NAGANUMA inhales sharply]

378
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,375
[NAGANUMA]
You're absolutely right!

379
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,625
Big brother will
fight with honor!

380

[KAZAMA grunts]

381
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,208
[NAGANUMA] On behalf
of anime voice-over

382
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,083
from both sides of the Pacific.

383
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,583
I will take you down!

384
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,083
Prepare to be defeated!

00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,291
Good heavens, he's
actually opening his eyes!

386
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,875
[NAGANUMA] Ooh! She sounds
so cute when she says that!

387
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,375
[KAZAMA] Pound for pound, he's
the most annoying of all three.

388
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,791
And Matsubara's moving the
fight back in our direction.

389
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,750
Our situation's deteriorating!

390
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,000
Enough is enough.
Put me down, Kazama.

391
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:47,916
[KAZAMA] Huh?

392
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,458
[ROKA]
I've recuperated mostly.

393
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,333
Leave me here and
get back to Chitose.

394
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,333
You're not ready to be
left on your own yet!

395
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,666
You're still shaking
like a damn leaf!

396
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,250
Then before you let go,
to fully recharge me,

397
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,000
hug me as tight as possible!

398
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,250
[KAZAMA] How is that
supposed to work?

399
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,416
There's no time to explain.

400
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,041
Just get on with it already!

401
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,875
Forget it!
Not happening!

402
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:07,875
[ROKA sighs]

403
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:08,958
You can't blame
a gal for trying.

404
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,791
Very well.

405
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,125
Let us focus on our
counter attack strategy.

406
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,208
[KAZAMA] Huh?

407
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,125
[ROKA] Firstly,
we break up--like so.

408
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,458
[KAZAMA] Oh! Is this
how I'm gettin' away?

409
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:22,375
Wait. If it means leavin'
you behind, I'm not doin' it.

410
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,500
[ROKA chuckles]

411
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,291
[KAZAMA] You need
the nurse's office,

412
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,333
that's where we're going.

413
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,541
[ROKA]
I'm hardly defenseless.

414
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,208
Naganuma can't bring
himself to harm me--

415
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,375
not while he thinks I
sound like, well, whoever.

416
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,291
And while it'd be nice to think
you could shoulder past him

417
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,500
without incurring injury,
I have my doubts.

418
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:36,666
When push comes to shove,

419
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,375
he might even be able
to eat your lunch.

420
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,500
[KAZAMA] Thanks for
the vote of confidence!

421
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,916
Listen to me.

422
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,833
If we can arrange it, I believe
a head to head with Tama

423
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,041
would be closer
to your speed.

424
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,375
[KAZAMA] Huh?

425
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,166
That, and I don't believe
Chitose can take her.

426
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,250
After all, she countered
my Bag Attack.

427
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,333
I realize it's asking a
great deal of you, Kazama.

428
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,666
But Chitose's gonna
need your help!

429
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,833
I'm on it.

430
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,250
So, how do I get back
to the classroom?

431
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,708
If I make a break for it,

432
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,666
this freak'll be on my ass
before you can say 'anime.'

433
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,375
Then I propose using your
secret move to sidestep him.

434
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,083
Oh yeah!

435
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,041
Wait, I have a secret move?

436
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,875
[ROKA]
Indeed you do.

You're surrendering?

440
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,708
Yeah, not exactly, pal.

441
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,166
It would behoove you not
to underestimate my friend.

'Cept that we're
sorta hoping he does.

Kazama's secret move!

444
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,041
Be warned, sir!

445
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,125

standing there? Come on!

The turbo jump he first showed
us during the Game Tournament!

453
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,708
Only this time,
with Yamada's help,

454
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:55,875
he's doubled the height--

what we've just seen?

00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,791
Stop dribbling the damn
ball while you chase me!

476
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,375
Nobody cares about your moves!

477
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,041
[phone beeps]

478
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,083
So whaddya say we fight
for real this time, yeah?

479
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:46,958
[MATSUBARA chuckles]

480
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,500
You're one scary little girl.

481
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:51,375
You want me to pull out the
stops--fine have it your way!

482
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,875
You've taken damage,
sure, anyone can see--

483
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,291
[NAGANUMA whimpers]

484
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,708
Anyone can see?

485
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,333
Charming.

486
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,166
[ROKA sighs]

487
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,041
[phone beeps]

488
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,916
[ROKA groans]

489
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,083
[NAGANUMA]
Ha! Pluck my eyes out

490
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,625
for all the good
it'll do ya, noob!

491
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,833
Only the savviest of anime
fans could have a prayer

492
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,333
of answering that question!

493
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,666
[NAGANUMA gasps]

494
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,875
Uh-oh! I've screwed the
pooch big time, haven't I?

495
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,500
The background on my phone is a
pic of Twenty Three Tokyo Wards

496
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,208
Magical Defense Girl Fuchuu!

497
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,208
How could I've made
such a weaboo mistake?

498
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,916
I might as well have written
the answer out for her

499
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,958
on a white flag!
Please don't notice!

500
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,458
Please don't notice!

501
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,458
Ah. Twenty Three Tokyo Wards
Magical Defense Girl Fuchuu,

502
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,333
can't believe it took me
this long to figure out.

503
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,875
[NAGANUMA] No!

504
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,750
She didn't even
need the hint!

505
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,958
[ROKA sighs]

506
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,458
I've done my part, Kazama.

507
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,333
It's up to you.

508
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,250
[ROKA] Well, Sakura,
it appears we have

509
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,083
quite the adversary
on our hands.

510
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,833
Before we start.

511
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,958
You, uh, you sure sending him
upstairs was a wise move?

512
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,333
Quite so.

513
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,791
My faith in Kazama's ingenuity
is almost boundless.

514
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,458
[MASON] Cold Freezer!
Cold Freezer!

515
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,791
Aaaah!

516
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,125
Ahh! Kazama!

517
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,000
What should I do?
What should I do?

518
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,291
Oh crap!

519
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,541
Takao speaking.
[dribbling in background]

520
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,291
[KAZAMA] Hey, it's me!
Are you still with the others?

521
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,666
Are you playing
basketball?

522
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,208
[KAZAMA]
Is Chitose all right?

523
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,541
Uh, well...
Define all right.

524
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,208
'Cause she's in a
little bit of a bind.

525
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,000
[KAZAMA] Listen, I need
you to put me on speaker.

526
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,875
[TAKAO gasps]

527
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,833
[phone beeps]

528
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,041
[KAZAMA] Yo!
[dribbling in background]

529
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,500
Am I coming in loud and
clear for everybody?

530
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,833
It sounds like he's
playing basketball.

531
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,750
[KAZAMA] Hang in there, Prez!
I'm coming!

532
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,500
Don't worry, I know
the score, I think.

533
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:44,208
You and this Tama chick
have a history of bad blood.

534
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,916
Word is you've never gotten
the better of her once.

535
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,250
[CHITOSE grunts]

536
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,458
Why didn't he call
me "little Tama"?

537
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,375
[KAZAMA] Look, this all happened
'cause of me and I'm sorry.

538
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,958
If I haven't let 'em
catch me, we'd--

539
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,375
Whatever.

540
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,625
Point is I'm on the way!
Don't die before I get there!

541
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:05,250
So I'm a damsel in
distress now, huh?

542
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,666
Can the dribbling,

543
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,500
it sounds like you're falling
down a flight of stairs.

544
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:09,625
Where's Roka?

545
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,125
Believe it or not,
she's actually okay.

546
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,250
She told me to come
and help you out.

547
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,541
'Least if I can maneuver
around this bunch of freaks.

548
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,625
Well, hurry it up.

549
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,875
I'm not in the habit
of waiting for people.

550
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,958
You wanna be my shield, you
better get up here right now!

551
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:28,083
You picked a strange time
to start acting tough.

552
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,541
[CHITOSE] Huh?
Did you say something?

553
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:32,416
I wasn't listening.

554
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,458
We're just getting started.

555
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,541
What good is a pony tail
going to be?

556
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,416
After all, you've only got one.

557
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,291
You really think it
can defeat my pigtails?

558
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,500
[KAZAMA] Whoa!

559
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,833
What kind of fight is
this supposed to be?

560
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,208
[footsteps and dribbling]

561
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,458
[KAZAMA yells]

562
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:22,625
[KISARAZU]
Dude, what's the de--?

563
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,500
Excellent bounce pass.
