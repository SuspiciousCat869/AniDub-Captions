1
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,416
[MINAMI] So, do you know why you
two have been summoned here?

2
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,291
Because of that little stunt
we pulled on the school grounds?

3
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:46,750
Sorry if we caused
any trouble,

4
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,875
but I didn't think things
would get that out of hand.

5
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,583
Oh. I'm afraid
you've misunderstood,

6
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,083
that's not what
this is about at all.

7
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,333
Wait. That's really not it?

8
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,583
Well, then why the heck
did you haul us in here?

9
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:59,291
[MINAMI] Relax.
We just want to talk to you.

10
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,500
Kazama. We brought
you here today

11
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,250
because of the
zipper-shot incident!

12
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,625
[TAKAO] Aahh!

13
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:07,041
[KAZAMA and TAKAO]
What? For that?

14
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,708
[KAZAMA] They called us in
because of the zipper-shot?

15
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,791
That doesn't make any sense.

16
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,083
The teachers are concerned
about the track suits.

17
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,375
The durability of their design

18
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,833
is now being called
into question.

19
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,083
Wait, what?
Is this some kind of a joke?

20
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,958
Aren't they focused
on the wrong thing here?

21
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,958
[MINAMI]
Hm. Well, either way,

22
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,458
student safety is not
something we take lightly.

23
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,166
Surely you can appreciate that?

24
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,166
Man. This is so stupid.

25
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,875
Gosh. I had no idea
breaking my tracksuit

26
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,916
would cause
so much trouble.

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
[TAKAO] But I can't admit
that it really broke.

28
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:11,000
Because it was too small
for me to squeeze into.

29
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,708
It was too small for
her to squeeze into.

30
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:16,583
Of course her tracksuit
popped a zipper!

31
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,583
[KAZAMA and TAKAO] Uhh...

32
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:19,958
I'm sorry, everybody.

33
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,791
I've been using my
awkward teenage phase

34
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,041
as an excuse to hide
that I've gained weight.

35
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,833
[KAZAMA]
"Gained weight"? Hold on.

36
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,708
Don't tell me she really
doesn't know why it broke!

37
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,250
Let's calm down everyone.

38
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,958
It's true this problem
started with you,

39
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,750
but it's not an
isolated incident.

40
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,291
The popularity of
the zipper-shot's

41
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,958
been spreading like wild fire.

42
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:37,708
[KAZAMA]
Whaddaya mean?

43
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:38,916
Well, you see.

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,916
Students all across
campus are beginning to

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,208
copy your signature move!

46
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,833
Are you kidding me?!

47
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,333
This frightening new trend has
resulted in a constant stream

48
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,708
of injured students.

49
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:48,958
[KAZAMA] Wait a sec,
why would anybody wanna try--

50
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,958
These two were
the first casualties.

51
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:51,583
Yo!

52
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,833
[KAZAMA] But why?

53
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,500
[MINAMI] Yes, why try
something so dangerous?

54
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:55,375
[KAZAMA] Dangerous?

55
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,916
You see, the thing is...

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,375
It's fun. And I also get to feel
what it's like to be Takao.

57
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,416
[KAZAMA] Huh?

58
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,250
Hmph. It's like they say.

59
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,166
"Boobs. If you can't
touch real ones,

60
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,291
just cup your
hands in the air

61
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,666
while going one hundred
miles per hour.

62
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,166
It's almost like
the real thing!"

63
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,416
Big ole' F Cups!

64
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,666
[KAZAMA]
It's not the same!

65
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,541
Yeah, man, but
the best part of all

66
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,000
is that we totally
pulled it off!

67
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,250
[KAZAMA] Could you remember
you're a guy for a second?

68
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,291
Now, what did it feel like?

69
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,583
[MUROMI and OHORI]
Not cool.

70
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:21,916
It hurt so bad.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,250
My mom grounded me 'cause
I ruined my tracksuit!

72
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,875
[KAZAMA] Serves you right,
freak-a-zoids!

73
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,125
[OHORI] It's all your fault!

74
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,666
Next time be gentler
when you shoot it off!

75
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,291
[MUROMI] I'm workin' free for
a week to pay for that suit!

76
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,875
[KAZAMA] Guys!
Break it up!

77
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,625
And they definitely
aren't the only ones.

78
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,291
How many dummies
we talkin' here?

79
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,541
Huh?

80
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,458
But, out of all the cases,
this is the worst.

81
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,000
Her name is Saginuma.

82
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,000
When she heard about
Takao's zipper-shot,

83
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,541
it's reported she was yelling

84
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,916
"She's not the only one
with an amazing rack",

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,958
as she tried to "bust
out," so to speak!

86
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,458
But the zipper
never shot off,

87
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,000
and her depression was so severe
she dropped out of school.

88
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,125
[KAZAMA] Weird thing
to base your pride on.

89
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,208
And there's nothing
wrong with her tracksuit!

90
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,625
That poor thing.

91
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,333
I feel absolutely awful,
I should go apologize to her.

92
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,416
I wouldn't, it'll only
make things harder.

93
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,625
Why do you say that?

94
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,333
You really don't
get it, huh?

95
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,416
And the list goes on and on.

96
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,666
[KAZAMA] I think
this school may have

97
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,500
the dumbest student body ever.

98
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,083
So, that's the long
and short of it.

99
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,458
But enough of that, what do you
really think of the tracksuits?

100
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:18,125
[KAZAMA] Hmm... I never
really thought about it.

101
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,666
Hey, what about you?
What's your opinion on 'em?

102
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,958
What? Why are
you asking me?

103
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:26,250
You wear a tracksuit
every day, don't you?

104
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,666
He's got a point.

105
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,125
Now that he mentioned it,

106
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,416
I don't think I've ever seen
you wearing anything else!

107
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,125
I feel a story coming on!

108
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh, uh...

109
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,250
[sighs]

110
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,083
Well...

111
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,541
Dude, you totally called it!

112
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:42,416
To be honest, my story
is fairly typical.

113
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,500
It happened back when I was just
starting out as a new teacher.

114
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48,291
I was so inexperienced at
the time that I'd get battered

115
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,708
and bruised just trying
to make it to school.

116
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,041
[MINAMI] I made it.

117
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,958
Walking all the way from
Hachioji is pretty scary,

118
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,041
I wasn't sure If I'd
ever get out alive.

119
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,500
[KAZAMA] Oh please, Hachioji's
in the middle of Tokyo!

120
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:01,500
Are you calling me a liar?

121
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,375
[KAZAMA]
Don't talk to me!

122
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,708
You're breaking the fourth wall!

123
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,375
Miss Osawa, you're
running behind again?

124
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,125
Goodness!
You're not looking so hot!

125
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,000
[MINAMI] This young woman's
name was Totsuka.

126
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,208
She wasn't the most well
behaved student in school,

127
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:16,041
but for some reason, she'd
taken a bit of a liking to me.

128
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,291
[KAZAMA] Huh. Guess every class
is bound to have its weirdoes.

129
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,791
[MINAMI] I can't remember
what she looked like.

130
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,125
[KAZAMA] Hey, come on,
aren't you supposed to be

131
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,250
painting a picture here?

132
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,125
This is no time to
be drawing a blank!

133
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,125
[MINAMI]
We were sort of friendly

134
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,541
throughout her
High School years.

135
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,208
And then, eventually,
her graduation came.

136
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,916
[KAZAMA] You just
skipped a lot of time!

137
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,458
[NOBORITO] Miss Osawa!

138
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,541
[MINAMI] Hm?

139
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,125
[NOBORITO chuckles]

140
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,208
[NOBORITO]
Here. Take it.

141
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,375
What's this for?

142
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,333
[NOBORITO] Well, duh,
cause your clothes

143
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,625
are always falling apart!

144
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,916
Now that I'm graduating,
I won't need it anymore,

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,208
so I figured I might
as well give it to you.

146
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,250
Better to give it to someone
who'll put it to good use.

147
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,333
And I can't think of anyone
who needs it more than you.

148
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,750
Thank you,
Too? Tohru? Toruko?

149
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,208
Oh! It's Totsuka!

150
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,500
[KAZAMA] You didn't know her
name until she graduated?

151
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,958
[MINAMI] And that's the story
of how I got this tracksuit.

152
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,958
And by some stroke of luck,
I've managed to wear it

153
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,625
this entire time
without destroying it.

154
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:11,625
[KAZAMA] It's not luck, it's
'cause you take care of it.

155
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:15,416
Uh... Her name wasn't
Totsuka, it was Noborito.

156
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,541
Hi there,
I'm Noborito.

157
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,958
[KAZAMA]
You got her name wrong?!

158
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,916
You need to work on
your story telling!

159
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,708
That's the sweetest thing I've
ever heard in my entire life,

160
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,750
when I graduate I want you
to have my tracksuit too!

161
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,291
[KAZAMA] She won't
remember your name!

162
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,958
Please. It's not like I can
fit into her tracksuit anyway,

163
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:30,833
I'm still waiting to "bloom."

164
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:31,875
[KAZAMA]
She doesn't want it!

165
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,250
Fine then, I don't
want it either!

166
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,291
[KAZAMA]
No one asked you!

167
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,000
Even though I'm
a man, I suppose...

168
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,125
[KAZAMA] All right,
that's enough!

169
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,000
This is awful.

170
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,083
I'm sorry for the trouble
I've caused everybody.

171
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,458
I feel like we're
all overreacting

172
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,958
to this whole zipper-shot thing.

173
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:46,833
[MINAMI grunts]

174
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,625
What is wrong with kids today?

175
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,458
And now, looking back on it,

176
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,500
I don't think any one person
is really to blame

177
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:53,458
for what happened.

178
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,333
[TAKAO gasps]

179
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,416
Sounds good to me.

180
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,041
And there's no need for you
to change the tracksuits.

181
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,291
After all,

182
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:07,625
you've kinda proven just
how durable they are.

183
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,208
Hey. Good point.

184
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,708
Yeah. This suit has
held up pretty well,

185
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,083
all things considered.

186
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,916
It has.

187

Kay.
Go to class now.

188
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,791
[OHORI and MUROMI]
Yes, ma'am.

189
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,416
Are you sure
about this?

190
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,500
No reason to treat something
like a major crisis

191
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,541
when the answer's
really quite simple.

192
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,208
Hey, Takao.
Don't shoot off your zippers.

193
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,458
That sound fair?

194
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,416
Yes. That won't be a problem!

195
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,916
My new suit's much bigger!

196
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,208
It's not nice to brag!

197
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,375
Oh! I'm sorry!

198
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,250
[KAZAMA sighs]

199
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,833
I'm glad to be done with that.

200
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,958
Uh. Thank you.

201
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:39,666
[KAZAMA] Uh!

202
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,125
I mean it, thanks a lot.

203
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,791
What're you
talkin' about?

204
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,166
I feel guilty for putting you
out and making you go through

205
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,666
all of this stuff on my behalf.

206
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,541
[KAZAMA] I don't get it,
why would you feel guilty?

207
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,083
Well, they were...

208
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,583
[KAZAMA] They were making
a big deal out of nothing.

209
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,500
So don't sweat it.

210
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,166
[TAKAO]
Uh. Yeah, okay.

211
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,041
Later!

212
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,458
Hey! Wait a second.

213
00:08:58,541 --> 00:08:59,666
[KAZAMA] Eh?

214
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,375
If-If you don't have
plans this weekend...

215
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,625
We could maybe...

216
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,083
[KAZAMA] Huh?

217
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,875
That was such an incredible
thing you did back there.

218
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,458
You could've looked
the other way.

219
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,666
I just wanna return the favor.

220
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,541
We should hang out on Sunday.

221
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:13,750
If you're not busy.

222
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,666
Oh. You wanna treat
me to something, huh?

223
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,666
Yeah. That's right!
It'll be kinda like a date!

224
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,041
Oh, crap!
I said that out loud!

225
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,458
Huh, so uh, didn't you say
something about treating me?

226
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,625
[TAKAO sighs]

227
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,125
You do know what that
means, don't you?

228
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:43,041
It means you take me to,
like, a movie or somethin'.

229
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,250
[TAKAO] Mm.

230
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,833
[KAZAMA] Cool.
Glad I didn't misunderstand.

231
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,708
'Cause that woulda been
embarrassing, huh?

[TAKAO] Yes!

240
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,583
This looks just about right.

241
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,875
It's so rare you get
all dolled up like this!

242
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,750
It's not that rare, mom!
Gah, just leave me alone!

243
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,583
The only thing you ever wear
is that grubby old tracksuit.

244
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:15,500
It's disgusting and it
has a broken zipper.

245

Well, you see,
the problem is--

Of course she's
dressed to the nines.

This is a big deal for her!

After all, it's not every day

and cancel, right?

00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,166
But I've never
called him before!

257
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,833
What do I do?
What do I do?!

258
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,208
What else can I say besides
my plan fell through

00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,208
and this is a complete disaster?

I'm sorry,
I'm a total failure.

261

If you had plans, you
shoulda just called first.

262
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,041
I wouldn't have minded
switching to another day.

[TAKAO chuckles]

264

[TAKAO] I'm so lame!
Is there anyone lamer than me?

In that case,
I'm outta here.

buy me lunch at
school or something.

[TAKAO] You know, come to think
of it, you still owe me a favor!

272
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,916
[KAZAMA] Huh?

playing that por--uh,

made me take part?

that stupid game with you!

That was a figure
of speech!

You can't hold me to that!

here and hang out with me

until the damn game
goes on sale!

Then maybe I'll let you leave!

say, "please."

[KAZAMA] Is that
really all she wants?

00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,041
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

the most of it.

[TAKAO chuckles]

289
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,416
[KAZAMA] So...

290
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,708
You said something
about a game,

291
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,125
which one are you waiting for?

292
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,583
[TAKAO squeals]

293
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,875
[NARRATOR] And now:
the legend behind

294
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,666
the Magical Village Series!

295
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,583
The first game in the
Magical Village Series

296
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,750
was released to
the public in 1987.

297
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,208
Its initial success spawned
a number of sequels.

298
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:01,750
This magic action game is
representative of Japan!

299
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:02,916
Here's the premise:

300
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,458
The palace wizard,
by the name of Mason,

301
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,791
goes to rescue Queen Ashan,
who for some odd reason,

302
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,916
keeps getting kidnapped
by the Demon King.

303
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,583
It has a simple story
combined with

304
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,416
a frustratingly hard
difficulty level!

305
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,708
The quality has barely
changed for the past decade,

306
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:18,125
making it a smash hit with older
fans and retro gamers alike!

307
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,791
Of course the game's
content was a plus,

308
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,500
but Mason's charm...

309
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,666
[KAZAMA] Makes sense.

310
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,875
The President of the
Game Creation Club's

311
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,250
a video game nerd.

312
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,625
I can talk about this
game for hours on end.

313
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,916
Yeah. It's better if
you don't do that.

314
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,416
[NARRATOR] Welcome to
the Magical Village!

315
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,791
[TAKAO] The first version
went on sale in 1987.

316
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,666
At the time, the graphics
were top of the line,

317
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,875
and it ushered the gaming
industry into a new era.

318
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,583
That's how the legend began!

319
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,291
[KAZAMA] I said you
shouldn't talk about it!

320
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,916
Who cares about some
crap game that came out

321
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,333
before we were born?

322
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,875
[NARRATOR] Oh, Over Yonder
is the Magical Village!

323
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,166
[TAKAO] The second release
was even more successful!

324
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,541
[KAZAMA] 
That title sucks!

325
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,708
Why didn't they make it the
"Super Magical Village?"

326
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,750
[NARRATOR] More to the Right,
More to the Left and voila!

327
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,208
It's the Magical Village!

328
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,625
[TAKAO] When this one
was in the works,

329
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,750
all the main staff were snatched
up by another company.

330
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:01,791
Things were lookin' bad.

331
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:02,958
[KAZAMA] After three
freakin' years,

332
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,250
the graphics haven't
changed at all?!

333
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,166
Following that, they had
a long series of flops,

334
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,708
one after the other.

335
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,208
Believe it or not though, the
game that's going on sale...

336
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,833
[NARRATOR]
Heh, heh, heh.

337
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,458
Hmm?
Magical Village?

338
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,666
[OTAKU 8A] Fire!

339
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,791
[TAKAO] ...was made
by the original staff

340
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:17,750
and is said to be
the next masterpiece

341
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,291
of the video
game industry!

342
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,250
[KAZAMA] Whoa! Talk about
a dramatic leap forward

343
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,666
in quality!

344
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,916
Yeah, tell me about it.

345
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,666
And I actually kinda
liked the pixels.

346
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,000
So what's the deal?

347
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,750
Are these guys dressed
up as the characters

348
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,416
from the game or something?

349
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,583
[TAKAO] This store is
legendary among fans,

350
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,416
so a lot of hard-core
gamers tend to shop here.

351
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,958
But that's not
why I chose it.

352
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,750
I like this place,
it's close to home

353
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,416
and compared to the megastores,
they have some great deals.

354
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,375
This game includes a
promotional cell phone strap

355
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,333
of Mason riding
Endgar the dolphin!

356
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,708
I'm so excited,
I can hardly wait!

357
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,250
Come on. Is this place
gonna open or what?

358
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,750
Uh?!

359
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,166
Is it just me?

360
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,416
Or does that bring a
certain someone to mind?

361
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,250
I know, talk
about dedication.

362
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,333
The person who owns that
tent camped here all night

363
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,791
so they could be first in line.

364
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,708
Kinda makes me feel
like a loser.

365
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:04,750
Really?!

366
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,625
So it doesn't remind
you of anyone?

367
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:07,958
Hm? No why?

368
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,833
How is it that you never
managed to see her before?

369
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,583
Excuse me, Miss,
but the store's open now.

370
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,458
Uh...
I was asleep.

371
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:18,833
Yeah, well, maybe I'm
just being paranoid.

372
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,416
[TAKAO gasps]

373
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,875
[KAZAMA]
See, I told you!

374
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,208
You should pay more
attention to your surroundings.

375
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,041
[TAKAO] Oh, crap.
Oh, crap!

376
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,000
[KAZAMA] Huh?

377
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:30,958
We've gotta hide!

378
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,125
[KAZAMA] What?

379
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,833
No way. Who cares
if she spots us here?

380
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:34,958
I do, you idiot!

381
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,708
If she sees us
together, she'll flip!

382
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,583
She's coming this way!
Whadda we do?

383
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,541
That'll work!

384
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:41,958
[KAZAMA] Huh?

385
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,125
Kazama?

386
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,458
[high-pitched voice]
No, sorry, you uh...

387
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,791
You must have the wrong person.

388
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,166
I don't believe that's true.

389
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,625
As a result of
your voice shifting

390
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,208
from its default
base to falsetto.

391
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,083
I've deduced that the
frequency differential

392
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,666
could only indicate
Kenji Kazama.

393
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,583
And I've deduced
that you're annoying!

394
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,875
So yeah, big deal.
It's me, Kazama!

395
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:06,583
[ROKA] I knew it.

396
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:07,916
Oh, shut up already!

397
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,750
But I must admit, I never
thought that I'd see you

398
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,500
waiting in line at a game store
wearing a Mason cosplay!

399
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,333
Well, it's not like I'm
wearing this stupid thing

400
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,708
because I want to!

401
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,708
[KAZAMA]
This is totally embarrassing.

402
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,375
Hey, what's
wrong with you?

403
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,875
[TAKAO] For a last-minute
hiding spot,

404
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,000
I thought it was a
pretty decent idea.

405
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,791
But it's super-hot in here.

406
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,083
Not to mention,
it smells like Con-Funk.

407
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,166
I feel bad for the guy next
to us who lent us his robe.

408
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,208
[ROKA] Hm. I see what this is.

409
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,750
A scantily clad man
sitting to your right.

410
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,500
He's cosplaying Mason
after he's hit

411
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,833
with a clothes-abolishing spell!

412
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,000
Yes, you're correct!

413
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,750
I'm impressed you
picked up on that!

414
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,833
[KAZAMA]
He's impressed?

415
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,791
Ah, forget about it.

416
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,125
Why don't you hurry back
to your own spot in line?

417
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,166
[ROKA]
But I don't wanna.

418
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,083
Not after I just ran into you.

419
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,208
Hey, I know!
Let's make a deal.

420
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,875
I'll go back if you
successfully pretend

421
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,791
to cast Mason's
"Fire Archer" spell!

422
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,625
Otherwise, I can stay
here as long as I please!

423
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:02,791
[KAZAMA] Seriously?!

424
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:03,958
[KAZAMA] This is not good!

425
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,500
Even if I knew what
"Fire Archer" was,

426
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,958
I don't want to make
an ass of myself.

427
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,333
Let's do it, Kazama!
Stand up, my friend!

428
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:13,750
[KAZAMA] I owe this
dude, big time!

429
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,083
Old geezer's really
playin' the part!

430
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:19,083
The only problem is this robe
is way too short on me.

431
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,916
If I stand up, it'll be obvious
there's someone else inside.

432
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,916
No, it's okay.

433
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,458
We can work around
this, trust me,

434
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,416
all you have to do is brace
yourself when you stand.

435
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,125
What exactly are you
planning to do?

436
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,416
Alright. We both move
on the count of three.

437
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,166
Hold on, wait!

438
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,666
[TAKAO] 
One, two, three!

439
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,875
[KAZAMA yells]

440
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,791
Oh, man.

441
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,041
[TAKAO groans]

442
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:45,583
[KAZAMA] Uh, yeah.
Wow. This is kind of, uh--

443
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:46,833
I'm sorry.

444
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,250
I know I'm a little heavy,
but hang in there.

445
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:52,125
No, really, it's not
your weight, it's your--

446
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,958
[TAKAO] Gosh, his
hair is so spikey!

447
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:57,625
So! Let's do it together
now everybody!

448
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,500
[OTAKU 8A] Fire Archer!

449
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,083
Fire Archer, or whatever.

450
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,458
[ROKA squeals]

451
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,750
[KAZAMA] Whoa.

452
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,250
I have no idea what
I'm doing, and honestly...

453
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,041
I don't think I wanna know!

454
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,083
[ROKA] Yay!
Fire Archer!

455
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,333
Kazama just cast
the Fire Archer spell!

456
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,500
[KAZAMA] I'm glad
you enjoyed that,

457
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,833
now run back to your spot, okay?

458
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,125
I have an idea!

459
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,458
You should cast the
"Cold Freezer" spell next!

460
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:25,416
[KAZAMA] Hell no!

461
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,000
The cold--

462
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,416
[KAZAMA]
Not necessary!

463
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,833
[ROKA] Nuts.

464
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,041
There's one last thing.

465
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,958
Seriously?!
What now?!

466
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,291
[ROKA]
It's about my bag.

467
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,291
Have you been taking care of it?

468
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,541
[TAKAO gasps]

469
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,250
Do you really have to

you in the clubroom,

Well, I wouldn't say

To be honest, I'm not
sure what to do with it.

around in my briefcase.

You're cool with that?

Did you hear me say I stuff
it into my briefcase?

gonna make it!

What am I doing?

Why did I leave him there
like that, I don't understand.

501
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,583
Why in the world would
I react so dramatically

502
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,125
to something so trivial?

503

No!

Geez, I really am
pathetic, aren't I?

There's no point in
trying to go back now,

he's probably already left.

510
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,625
Seeing him tomorrow at
school's gonna be weird,

511
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,000
and I didn't even
buy the stupid game.

512
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,625
[KAZAMA] That was pretty
dumb, wasn't it?

Aaaahhh!

What on earth are
you doing here?

517
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,333
I got you your
game. See?

518
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,083
[TAKAO] Huh?

00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,916
[TAKAO] Wow!
But, how'd you do it?

[KAZAMA sighs]

522

Hurry and buy that game so you
can go after her, my friend!

523
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:52,750
[KAZAMA] For some
strange reason,

the guys in the front
of the line let me cut.

00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,125
So what's the deal?

526
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,250
If you didn't feel good,
why'd you take off like that?

[TAKAO whimpers]

[TAKAO] I'm sorry.

[TAKAO] Please! Forgive me for
all the trouble I caused you!

[KAZAMA] Hey.

536
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,458
So, you're feeling
better now, right?

537
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:20,958
[TAKAO] Huh?

538
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,583
Well, last time I checked
you still owe me a meal.

539
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,625
And I didn't eat anything
for breakfast this morning,

540
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,458
so I'm starving.

[TAKAO] Heh! Sure!

542
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,166
[KAZAMA] So...

00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,458
You're telling me you're broke
because you paid for that game?

00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,958
[TAKAO] Mm-hm.

But not if they find out about

dressed up today, didn't you?

leave something to be desired,

work out just fine in the end.

doing this morning?

It's nighttime already.

[TAKAO] Oh, I was up late
playing video games.

563
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,500
And since it's a
three-day weekend,

564
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,375
I think I'm gonna spend the
rest of today gaming as well.

Are you a high
school girl or not?

You're wasting the best days
of your life, you know?

Why don't you have
a boyfriend already?

Isn't there a guy
out there you like?

Oh no.

I guess no one's interested.

If I had a pair of
boobs like that,

hearts left and right.

you'd still be a member of

Mysterious Animals club.
