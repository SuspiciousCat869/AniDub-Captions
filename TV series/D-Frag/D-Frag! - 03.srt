00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,500
[CHITOSE] This is Fujou
Academy's Game Creation Club.

2
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:43,083
They nearly got shut down
last year, but the club's

3
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:46,458
current president, Takao,
rebuilt the club from scratch.

4
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:49,166
It was revived as the
New Game Creation Club.

5
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,250
Despite having zero
experience whatsoever,

6
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,291
they did an outstanding
job in tournaments

7
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:57,208
due to their exemplary knack
for working together as a team.

8
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,916
Rumors of their greatness have
spread to schools everywhere.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,541
In other words...
we can't win in a fair fight!

10
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:07,000
Our victory rests
on one thing alone.

11
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,416
Sabotaging production.
The further we're willing to go,

12
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,000
the better our
chances of winning!

13
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:13,041
No way, we can't do that!

14
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,583
Oh! I've got a
great idea, you guys:

15
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,458
what if we get their
computer soaking wet?

16
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,500
[KAZAMA] Did you not
hear what I just said?

17
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,708
Or even better, we could pack
it to the brim with dirt.

18
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,708
Come on, guys, we're better
than that, aren't we?

19
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,750
Kazama's right. I'm afraid
I can't allow you to do that.

20
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,625
Your methods are
extremely time-consuming

21
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:30,000
and you'd run the risk of
getting caught in the act.

22
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:33,208
I have a better solution:
how 'bout we taze 'em?

23
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:36,375
Hey, I thought you were on
my side! No one's getting tazed!

24
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,375
There's only one way to
guarantee our victory--

25
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,291
by resorting to my firepower!

26
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:43,541
Ugh... It'd be a lot better
if you didn't try to help.

27
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,458
Look, you're the Game
Creation club, aren't you?

28
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,875
Can't you just try to win
with your game-making skills?

29
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,500
I mean, come on.
Let's play fair.

30
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,875
I'm only confident
in my stamina!

31
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,500
But I don't know how
to make stupid games.

32
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,791
The only skill I have is
throwing my weight around.

33
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,875
It's true: those who
can't do, teach.

34
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,250
So, in other words,
you're telling me

35
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,083
you actually suck
at making games.

36
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,791
Yep. We're screwed.

37
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:41,791
What about you?

38
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,291
[ROKA]
Hmph.

39
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,916
Hey! Look I'm sorry, okay,
but there's no reason to pout.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,375
I'm good at playing
"Super Marilyn."

41
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,291
I can beat the whole
game in under an hour.

42
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,666
If all you can do is play,

43
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,041
then I'm officially revoking
my apology right now!

44
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,333
[ROKA] "Super Marilyn"
happens to be

45
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,958
my favorite game of all time.

46
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:59,166
It first went on the market to
critical acclaim in the 1980's.

47
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,125
It was the first game ever to
feature a female protagonist.

48
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,166
Marilyn's seductive attack
moves redefined the industry.

49
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,958
Not only was the game fun,
it possessed a flair

50
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,541
of naughtiness that drew in
the eighteen-plus crowd.

51
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,500
To this day, sequels
are still being made!

52
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,750
[KAZAMA]
No one cares!

53
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,750
I'm startin' to think
maybe it would be better

54
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,333
to get it over with
and let them absorb us.

55
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,875
[KAZAMA sighs]

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,083
Either way, for now we
can all agree that we need

57
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,708
information on what
they're planning to do.

58
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,125
Without it, there's no
chance of victory.

59
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,916
You people just
don't get it, do you?

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,791
Oh, no, we "get it," all right.
We need you to spy for us.

61
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,333
[KAZAMA]
This is ridiculous!

62
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:35,625
Look! I'm sick of always doing
the dirty work around here!

63
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,375
Can't you see I'm giving
you the puppy dog eyes?

64
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,916
Doesn't that make you
wanna stop being a jerk

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,208
and help our team
win this thing?

66
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,791
Hell, no!

67
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,041
Oh, fine! Then whoever loses has
to spy on behalf of the group.

68
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,375
[KAZAMA] Ha! You girls
are dead meat!

69
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,208
[KAZAMA] I never expected
a friggin' chandelier

70
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,916
to come crashing down on me.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,583
Hey. I don't understand,
how come you're tagging along?

72
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,416
You beat me, remember?

73
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,958
What, do you have a problem
with me "tagging along"?

74
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:04,125
No. It's just after everything
you said back there...

75
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,041
Never mind, forget it.

76
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,708
[KAZAMA] That's one way
to get the point across.

77
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:13,958
[ROKA grumbles]

78
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,458
Roka, you see
anything in there?

79
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,083
Nope, I can't spy a thing.

80
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,208
Hey. On second thought,
why don't you go back?

81
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,333
Breaking and entering
is harder with two people.

82
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,625
I'm not leaving.

83
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,333
Well, why the hell not?

84
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,583
Look at what the
cat dragged in.

85
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,583
Hi. What a pleasant surprise.

86
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,958
Oh, cut the crap, ne'er-do-well!
You have a lot of nerve

87
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,333
showing your face around here
after everything you've said!

88
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,708
[KAZAMA] She does
raise a good point.

89
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,250
[TAKAO]
Whatever.

90
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,458
You wanna come in?
I'll show ya what we've got.

91
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,791
You sure?

92
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,250
You guys really suck.
It's not like showing you

93
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,208
is going to hurt our
chances of winning.

94
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,958
Oh. Thanks.

95
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,125
He's invited,
but you're not.

96
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,916
[ROKA groans]

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,416
[KAZAMA] Are you sure you want
me snooping around in here?

98
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:01,125
Oh, hey there, Yamada.
It's good to see you.

99
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,083
Sorry 'bout what
I did back there.

100
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,666
Ya know, punching you
and all that.

101
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,541
Please. Don't apologize,
I brought it on myself.

102
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,125
[KAZAMA] Whatever you say, man.
Respect all the same.

103
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,333
[YAMADA]
Thanks.

104
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,791
Whoa! Kenji Kazama?
What are you doing here?

105
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,333
[KAZAMA]
Hm?

106
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,333
Well. I suppose I owe you
a big "thank you," don't I?

107
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,083
[KAZAMA]
For what?

108
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,250
Hello, Kazama.

109
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,166
Huh? Oh, hi. Wait a sec,
weren't you a...?

110
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,250
[INADA]
Crap!

111
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,916
[SAKURAGAOKA]
Uh... Aw, man.

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,458
If he finds out I tricked him,
he's gonna punch me in the face!

113
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:33,833
I gotta get outta here!

114
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,583
Uh... See ya later!

115
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,791
On behalf of the entire club,
I'm truly thrilled you're here.

116
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,750
How 'bout a nice, hot cup
of coffee or something?

117
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,666
Sorry, we don't
have any coffee.

118
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,083
[INADA] Don't be silly,
we always have coffee!

119
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,333
[TAKAO] Come on. Do you
wanna see this or not?

120
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,750
Right.

121
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:52,583
Wow. So this is how you
make games? How does it work?

122
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:56,708
It's simple. You see this?
If you drag it over here...

123
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,166
[INADA] And now he will
fall into our clutches.

124
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,291
Just wait and see.

125
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,875
Pretty soon, those
"tig o' bitties"

126
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,875
will be smackin' him on
the back of his head,

127
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,708
reducing Kazama to nothing but
a pile of flustered man-putty.

128
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,625
When it comes to those gazongas,
she wins every time.

129
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,916
He's done for.

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,375
Yeah, well. They are
impressive. But still--

131
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,583
Still what? Don't
be shy, spit it out!

132
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,666
Why don't you
see for yourself?

133
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,625
Whoa! This can't be. No!

134
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,708
His hair is too spiky--it's
repelling her neck knockers!

135
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,291
She can't get her body
bumps anywhere near

136
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,666
the back of his head!

137
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,708
You must be overjoyed.
This means you won't lose him.

138
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,083
Uh... Wait.

139
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,208
[TAKAO cries out]

140
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,916
[KAZAMA]
Huh?

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,791
[TAKAO trembles]

142
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,750
[TAKAO screams]

143
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,166
[sound of slap]

144
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,416
Get out and stay out!

145
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,708
[KAZAMA groans]

146
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:50,458
Uh... Look. I'm really
sorry about that,

147
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,708
I know you never
intended for it to happen.

148
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,916
No. Please. There's no need
to say anything at all.

149
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,708
In that case, why don't
you join my club already?

150
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,041
What?

151
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,333
Why waste our time with
this duel when the outcome

152
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,625
is painfully obvious
to anyone with a brain?

153
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,375
And besides, maybe if
you were to join,

whichever of the two clubs
gets the most customers

wins--and no offense,

we will absorb your club.

00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,583
Hehe. Yeah, I'm really
sorry about that.

307
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,041
Hey, you look better than
her in that outfit. Wow.

308
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,166
Uh... Well... Thanks.
Since you brought it up,

309
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,541
this one forced
me to wear it.

310
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,875
I just told you it looked
good, why are you upset?

311
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:30,083
We're wearing these because...
it'll help attract customers.

312
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,458
[YAMADA]
Hello, Kazama.

313
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,791
[KAZAMA] Now that's
going too far!

314
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,916
[TAKAO] So.
Read 'em... and weep.

315
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,041
This is the result of my Game
Creation Club's hard work.

316
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,625
Everyone has thoroughly
enjoyed playing

317
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,833
the games we labored
so diligently to create.

318
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:44,833
[KAZAMA yawns]

319
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,375
[KAZAMA]
True enough.

320
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,000
So tell me, are you ready to
admit defeat? In the future,

321
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,416
we could work together and
make an even better club.

322
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,208
Yeah. It's a nice club,
there's no doubt about that.

323
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,625
But now it's your turn
to come check out

324
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,541
what we've got going on.

325
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,958
Fine, whatever! Even though
it's obvious we've beaten you,

326
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,125
I'll go along with
your little charade.

327
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,833
No way!
Wha... What is that?

328
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,000
[KAZAMA]
Isn't it obvious?

329
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,458
It's our Game Creation
Club's Offering.

330
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,958
Inside, well, we stuffed in
as many analog games

331
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,583
as we possibly could.
It was quite a feat!

332
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,458
[TAKAO] But... This is stupid.
These aren't even games!

333
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,208
[KAZAMA] Oh, come on,
sure they are.

334
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,583
We just didn't make
them with computers.

335
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,083
The team pulled
several "all-nighters"

336
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,708
to make the decorations.

337
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,458
As long as people have fun
doing it, then it's a game.

338
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:35,958
That's what she said, anyway.

339
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,333
Though I can understand
how that might anger you.

340
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,708
Yeah. Well... Even if
she is right about that...

341
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,250
There's a zero percent
chance you were able

342
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,750
to make that giant,
tacky thing without help.

343
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,458
[KAZAMA]
Mmm...

344
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,875
Come on, out with it!

345
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,833
Look. To be completely
honest with you...

346
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:51,958
We pulled strings.

347
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,500
You pulled what?

348
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,958
[KAZAMA] We rounded up
the student council

349
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,875
and some other guys
and made them help.

350
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,333
[TAKAO] You're despicable!
And... That's cheating!

351
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,500
[CHITOSE]
Actually, it's not.

352
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,458
After all, there's nothing
wrong with taking advantage

353
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:07,958
of a Club Member's
Assets, right?

354
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,375
[TAKAO] Wearing that
outfit is cheating too!

355
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,083
[KAZAMA] Uh...
I wouldn't go that far.

356
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,875
Look at her feet,
you'll think differently.

357
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,458
[TAKAO]
What the...?

358
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,250
I... I didn't lose because I'm
into sultry bunnies, I swear!

359
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,916
I fell victim to the law
of gravity, period!

360
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,583
So. According to
my calculations,

361
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:24,875
we beat you fair and square.

362
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,125
Of course people
would flock to this

363
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,750
ridiculous side show.
And I want a rematch!

364
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,125
Please. Your team demanded
the winner be decided

365
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,250
by who had more
customers, not us.

366
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,458
Even if I allow you to
compete with analog games,

367
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,708
these are other people's games,

368
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,916
and they're completely
lacking in originality!

369
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,916
Oh, give me a break, like the
mindless, idiotic games

370
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,083
you came up with are
overflowing with creativity!

371
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,375
At least we made
ours from scratch

372
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,250
instead of ripping
off other people!

373
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,375
We made ours
from scratch too,

374
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,583
and if I were you
I'd watch my mouth!

375
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,250
Yeah. But you--

376
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,833
But we what? Huh?
Spit it out, girlie!

377
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,916
It's just...
It's not fair.

378
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,791
[TAKAO cries]

379
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,916
Please don't cry.
I'm sorry that you're upset.

380
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,166
It doesn't matter to
me who wins or loses

381
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,500
this dumb competition.
But here's the thing.

382
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:19,250
Roka says she doesn't want to
let go of the club she has now.

383
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:23,458
Look. I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to destroy your precious club.

384
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,875
The truth is, I acted out of
pure rage back then, and I

385
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:29,250
didn't even stop to consider
the consequences of my actions.

386
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,125
[KAZAMA] That girl can be a real
pain in the butt sometimes.

387
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:36,666
I hope you can forgive me
for the grief I caused you.

388
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,208
From your point of view,
I can understand

389
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,625
how our club might seem
completely ridiculous.

390
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,916
But Roka has finally found a
place where she feels at home.

391
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,375
And I'm begging you. Please
don't take that away from her.

392
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,166
Would you tell me
where Roka is?

393
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,166
I'd really like to talk to her.

394
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,250
Uh. Well, about that...

395
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,791
[TAKAO]
Huh?

396
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,166
[TAKAO] Uh...
What is this?

397
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,166
[KAZAMA]
Beats me.

398
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,541
[TAKAO]
You don't know?

399
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,166
[KAZAMA]
I have no idea.

400
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,500
[FATHER laughs]

401
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,541
Before you're sent to hell,
you should know this...

402
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,625
You see, my dear boy, I am
your father. It is the truth.

403
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,875
No! I can't believe you're
my honest-to-goodness

404
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,708
biological father who I
haven't seen in fifteen years!

405
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,250
[FATHER laughs]

406
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,125
Do you have what it takes to
slay your absentee patriarch...

407
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,041
To kill your own
flesh and blood?

408
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,458
You bet I do!

409
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:29,666
Geez, you didn't
hesitate at all!

410
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,500
[ROKA]
And... cut!

411
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:35,333
Hey, that was a solid
performance you two just put on.

412
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,416
And bonus points for the whole
"I am your father" thing--

413
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,958
it was commendably awesome.

414
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,291
[FATHER &amp; SON]
Thanks!

415
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,791
It's a game! Wow!
It's bursting with originality!

416
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,625
Oh, hey, you guys,
guess what?

417
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,583
Four different people have
already played this game today

418
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,125
and they all said that they
had the time of their lives!

419
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,791
I'm glad to hear it.

420
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,375
[KAZAMA]
Four whole people came?

421
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:57,208
Everyone who played put on some
truly astonishing performances!

422
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,500
Takao?

423
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,708
I like your game.
It looks like fun.

424
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,875
Thanks. I gave it my all.

425
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:08,208
Roka. Are you,
uh, having fun?

426
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,375
Yeah.

427
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:13,166
Well. That's great.

428
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,625
In that case... This round
is over and you guys won.

429
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,750
[ALL]
Huh?

430
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,041
Well, what else can I say?

431
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,041
I admit that your Game
Creation Club is simply

432
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,083
too much for my group
to handle at the moment.

433
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,750
[ROKA]
Uh--!

434
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,291
Hold on.

435
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:35,125
I'm the president of this club.
So I can't very well join yours.

436
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,458
But... if you'd let me,
I would very much like

437
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:44,041
to be your friend.
And with that said...

438
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:47,458
How about you just quit your
club and join ours instead?

439
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,458
Who the heck do you
think you are?

440
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,833
[KAZAMA]
She killed the moment!

441
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:58,125
You'll never change, will you?
You're a lost cause.

442
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,458
[SAKURA] Thirsty?
I thought you might be!

443
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,916
Oh. Thank you.

444
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,916
Guess that's one problem
outta the way, huh?

445
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,250
You know,
despite what you say,

446
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,333
I bet you're actually
a nice person, aren't you?

447
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,916
Yeah, you're not a
delinquent at all.

448
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,458
Get off my back.

449
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:24,000
[students chatter]

450
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,291
[KAZAMA]
Hm?

451
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,500
[ROKA] Hey, Kazama.
Looks like the folk dancing

452
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,166
is about to start. Aren't you
gonna go check it out?

453
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,500
Seriously? What
makes you think

454
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,166
I'd be interested in
something like that?

455
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,750
[ROKA] So what's your
verdict on the FuF festival?

456
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,375
Well... I don't know,
I guess it was pretty fun.

457
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,625
[ROKA]
Thank you.

458
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,625
[KAZAMA]
For what?

459
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,291
[ROKA] Come on,
you know for what.

460
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,000
[KAZAMA]
Hm?

461
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,458
[ROKA] I'm grateful that you
joined my club. It means a lot.

462
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,458
Listen, I don't mean
to be a jerk wad.

463
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,166
But it's really hard
to take you seriously

464
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,916
with that thing on your face.
You should take it off.

465
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,208
[ROKA]
You don't like it?

466
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,750
[KAZAMA]
No.

467
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,791
The bottom line is, we failed at
getting rid of that stupid club.

468
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,208
Eh. Roka's only trying
to do the best she can.

469
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,000
I can't really
fault her for that.

470
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,333
But we're still planning
to destroy them, right?

471
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,583
Nah. As long as they change
the name of their club,

472
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,458
I think we can
all get along.

473
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,333
[TAKAO]
What's going on?

474
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,541
[SAKURA giggles]

475
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,083
What're you doing here?

476
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,166
We're very sorry for all the
trouble we caused the other day.

477
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,875
Although... to the victor goes
the spoils, as they say.

478
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,000
Or in this case, to the
winner goes the wobblies.

479
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,458
But... you held me and
said such nice things...

480
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,916
Yes, and I meant them.

481
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,083
And now I'm gonna tweak
those peaks like I mean it!

482
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,791
Rules are rules, after all.

483
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,625
Come on, this is
going too far!

484
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,458
Sorry, but we all
agreed on it,

485
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,916
and now it's my responsibility
to finish the job.

486
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,166
[CHITOSE cackles,
TAKAO whimpers]

487
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,916
[TAKAO screams]

488
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,333
[TAKAO]
I'm outta here!

489
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,250
[SAKURA]
Guys. She took off.

490
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:38,458
[ATARU] The Legend of the
Heroic Masochist, Ataru!

491
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:41,833
That's absurd! You want to
use the entire courtyard?

492
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:45,166
I can't let a single club take
up that much real estate!

493
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,708
Shut your mouth,
fill out the paperwork,

494
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,375
and no one gets hurt.

495
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,666
There is no way I'm gonna
budge on this issue!

496
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,500
I'm sick of you asking me
to do the impossible!

497
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,041
It's not me this time.

498
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,583
Technically, he's the one who
thought up this crazy plan.

499
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:00,083
[ATARU] What?
Is she telling the truth?

500
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:02,083
[KAZAMA] Uh...
Actually, she is.

501
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,500
I see. So, you're taking
the Culture Festival

502
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:06,291
really seriously, eh?

503
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,541
Then I suppose it can't be
helped, can it, Kazama?

504
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:10,500
Being that I'm your best
"bro dog" in the whole world,

505
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,375
it would be uncouth
for me to let you down.

506
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:16,083
Wow, that's, uh...
Thanks, man.

507
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,375
[CHITOSE] Well.
That turned out to be

508
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:20,208
a whole lot easier than
I thought it would be.

509
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:23,375
You know what, never mind,
I take back everything I said!

510
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,375
[KAZAMA]
Ataru...

511
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:27,000
Not cool.
