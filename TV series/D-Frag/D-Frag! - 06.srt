[school bell chimes]

2
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,000
[KAZAMA] Mr. Sean's
class is over;

3
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,333
guess that's my day.
Maybe I'll skip the rest.

4
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,708
[ROKA screams]

5
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:51,666
[ROKA]
You have to save me!

6
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,166
[KAZAMA] Ow, that was
my ribcage! What did you do?

7
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,250
[ROKA] He's coming!
My nemesis!

8
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:58,833
Wait, what?

9
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,083
Wait, what?

10
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,083
[KAZAMA] Someone
out there scares her?

11
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,458
Look, it's paramount
that I conceal myself.

12
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,083
You stand watch
and keep me updated!

13
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,166
[KAZAMA] Hey, hey, hey!
Uh-uh! Hold up!

14
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,541
Why you gotta drag me into this?

15
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,833
[ROKA] An excellent question!
Allow me to explain.

16
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,708
My nemesis is
fiendishly crafty.

17
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,791
However far I run,
he closes the distance!

18
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,083
[WOMAN] I'm sprinting
at full speed,

19
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,083
and he keeps up by walking.

20
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,208
[ROKA] It's like
a B-horror movie!

21
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:57,125
[KAZAMA] Doesn't really
answer my question.

22
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,125
[ROKA]
Good luck!

23
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,083
[KAZAMA]
She disappeared!

24
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,208
[KAZAMA] Damn it.
Fine, let's see this guy.

25
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,208
Hey, it's good to
have you back, Siou!

26
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,458
Thanks! Good to be back.

27
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,916
[GIRL B]
Look who it is!

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,916
Hi.

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,166
[GIRL B giggles]

30
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,250
[KAZAMA] Nah. It couldn't
be him, could it?

31
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,666
Do I detect my Roka's aura?

32
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,291
[KAZAMA]
Ugh. It is him!

33
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,291
[SIOU] You can run,
but you can't hide.

34
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,791
Whoa! Personal space, dude!

35
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:25,791
I know you're there.

36
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,791
Chill out!

37
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,750
[KAZAMA]
Where did she go?

38
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,125
[sound of
footsteps running]

39
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,625
[KAZAMA]
Seriously?

40
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,791
How'd you do that?

41
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,125
[SIOU chuckles]

42
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:39,333
Stand clear, friend.
It's my duty to pursue her.

43
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:42,208
[KAZAMA]
Mm... Oh, that's cool.

44
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,875
[ROKA]
You're terrible at this!

45
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,750
[KAZAMA]
And she's back.

46
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:46,916
Would you get off me, please?!

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,041
[ROKA] When the person
you're protecting

48
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,125
makes a run for it,
follow their lead!

49
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,458
[KAZAMA] I never
agreed to protect you!

50
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,458
I'm blown off again.

51
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,666
[KAZAMA] And he was
ready to catch her!

52
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,875
Fly to my arms, darling!

53
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,791
[KAZAMA] He turned around.
Go, fly, fly!

54
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,708
Yes, I'm aware,
but even I long to be

55
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,208
a free spirit every
now and again.

56
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,791
What the hell are you
even talking about?

57
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,000
[SIOU laughs]

58
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,625
Not a screed of that
devil-may-care attitude

59
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,541
has left you, I see!
And while some

60
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,833
find it off-putting,
I for one am captivated!

61
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,416
What? What's happening?

62
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,333
[SIOU laughs]

63
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,541
[SIOU] Ah... The more you
resist me, the more you entice!

64
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,500
[KAZAMA] Okay, I'm still
waiting for an explanation.

65
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:26,500
[FUNABORI] Well, for starters,
his name is Siou. I'm sorry!

66
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,583
Uh, where...?

67
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,000
[FUNABORI] Uh...
My classroom's nearby,

68
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,208
so I came to see what all
the commotion was about.

69
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:34,250
Oh, no. I meant, like, where
do you know this weirdo from?

70
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,750
[FUNABORI]
Weirdo?

71
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:40,208
Well, actually, Hachi Siou is
pretty famous around here.

72
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,125
Everyone knows him. His mom
and dad run the Siou Group,

73
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,833
a conglomerate that owns
a bunch of big-name brands.

74
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,833
The ladies are all about him,
and why wouldn't they be?

75
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,041
He's got looks, charm,
a family fortune.

76
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,166
[KAZAMA] Yeah, I get it.

77
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,500
My sources say he
took off from school

78
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,541
for a while to shadow his dad.

79
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,625
He's gonna run
the company one day.

80
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,833
But, for the moment,
it looks like he's back.

81
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,291
[KAZAMA]
Fantastic.

82
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:06,041
Oh, and he's totally lovesick!
How lucky is Roka?

83
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,250
[KAZAMA] That's just
what I was thinkin'.

84
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,333
So, is this the type of guy
that does it for you, or what?

85
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:11,500
[FUNABORI]
Huh?

86
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,125
He's a little too
sophisticated for me.

87
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,958
Uh, not that he's a snob or
anything. He's been a member

88
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,000
of the Game Creation Club
since before he left.

89
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,291
You're just now
getting to that?

90
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,958
Me and this guy are
in the same club?

91
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,458
[FUNABORI]
When did you join?

92
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,041
Ah! Another
gaming enthusiast

93
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,791
graces us with his presence?

94
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,875
Hey, Hachi Siou, Class 2-C.
Pleasure to meet you.

95
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,625
[KAZAMA] Oh, hey.
Kenji Kazama.

96
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,458
And how long have you
enjoyed the great good fortune

97
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,458
of our dear Roka's acquaintance?

98
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:40,750
[KAZAMA] Uh, I dunno.
Two months, maybe? Yeah?

99
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:44,291
 Isn't that fascinating?
I've known her since First Year.

100
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,458
Where does the
time go, am  I right?

101
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,708
[KAZAMA] 
Aw, jeez.

102
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,125
Now that I take a
moment to reflect,

103
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,791
I realize how deep
our friendship runs.

104
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,000
[KAZAMA] Could you
please let go of my hand?

105
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,791
Roka was one of the
first people I met here.

106
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,791
Huh? Are we about to
transition into a flashback?

107
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,500
[SIOU] I remember it
like it was yesterday.

108
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,458
There I was, strolling
through the courtyard.

109
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:01,708
[SIOU hums]

110
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,375
[SIOU] I am strolling
through the courtyard!

111
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,375
Laden with gifts from the lovely
womenfolk of this fine school.

112
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,291
[ROKA]
Aha! Finito!

113
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,125
You and I are going
to get along famously.

114
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,416
[SIOU]
Be still my heart!

115
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,166
Ah! A reticule for gym
articles and whatnot.

116
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,666
How industrious of you,
if I may be so bold, miss.

117
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,250
Uh... The gym is the last
thing this is meant for.

118
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,125
As a matter of fact, I never
intend to use it at all.

119
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,166
Never use it? But you
made it from scratch.

120
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,708
Let me honor your handiwork
by using it myself.

121
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,500
Are you asking for it?

122
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,333
[SIOU] 'Tis but a bauble
to you. But to me, dear lady,

123
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,041
it will bear the distinction
of an attaché case!

124
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,250
Are you not swept off your feet

125
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,583
at the prospect of
gifting it to me?

126
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:50,250
Come now! Girls love
giving me gifts!

127
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,416
[SIOU makes muffled cries]

128
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,375
Thus did the bird of love
pierce my heart with his beak!

129
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:59,916
[KAZAMA] Great. That's all
we need. Another one of them.

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,583
 Her gift has been with me
through rain and shine.

131
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,416
Indeed, I've kept it
close by ever since!

132
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,916
[KAZAMA] You can't even
tell what it is anymore!

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,875
In conclusion to
this tale of the hunt...

134
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,375
I shall not be deflected!

135
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,375
[ROKA] We'll see
about that.

136
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,250
I assure you,
I am intractable!

137
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:19,291
So, knowing I've also bagged
Kazama wouldn't deter you?

138
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,375
Why do you turn this
school into a den of lies?

139
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,833
Is she telling the truth?

140
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,291
[KAZAMA]
Yeah.

141
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:29,375
Well, my dear, this is,
I confess, a trifle dismaying.

142
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,375
But if I'm to be embroiled in a
love triangle, let it be grand!

143
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,541
[KAZAMA]
Do what now?

144
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,750
That is so romantic!

145
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,375
[KAZAMA] Uh, no.
No, it is not.

146
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,375
So romantic!

147
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,208
[KAZAMA]
Stop it!

148
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,416
Ah! This, fellow troubadours, is
the substance of true romance!

149
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,666
You stop touching me!

150
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,458
[SIOU] Raise your
voices to the firmament!

151
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:50,458
Love triangle, love triangle,
love triangle, love triangle!

152
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,500
La, la, la, la, la!
Tra la! Tra loo!

153
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,875
Love triangle!
Love triangle! Love triangle!

154
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:00,041
I am not in a love triangle!

155
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,875
[ROKA whimpers]

156
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:02,875
[SIOU]
My darling!

157
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,500
Worry not!
I'll save you!

158
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,708
[SIOU groans]

159
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,166
[ROKA grunts]

160
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,083
[FUNABORI &amp; KAZAMA]
Uhhh...

161
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,250
Uh... I might've pushed
a little too hard there.

162
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:19,125
I figured those catlike reflexes
o' yours woulda kicked in.

163
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,333
Sorry.
My bad.

164
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:25,541
[ROKA] Well, Kazama,
aren't you the lucky one?

165
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,583
For today shall be
your second bagging.

166
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,791
[KAZAMA]
U-Uh...

167
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,833
[KAZAMA screams]

168
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,208
[FUNABORI trembles]

169
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,208
[SIOU]
Isn't she a fire cracker?

170
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,875
From one love-stricken
rube to another,

171
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,333
give me the bag! I beg you!

172
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,416
[KAZAMA]
What?

173
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,916
Better yet, we
can wear it together!

174
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,708
[KAZAMA] Stay away
from me, man! I mean it!

175
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:49,250
Whatever you're about
to do, don't! No! Stop!

176
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,125
--[STUDENTS] Fight on!
--[TEACHER] Fight on!

177
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,541
[SIOU grunts]

178
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,625
Come on! Yeah!

179
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,041
[KAZAMA]
Uhh...

180
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,625
[SAKURA] That's the way!
Woo-hoo! Put your backs into it!

181
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,458
So what exactly do
you call this one?

182
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,458
[CHITOSE]
Push It Super Strong?

183
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,416
[KAZAMA] You do realize that
spells the acronym PISS?

184
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,708
[KAZAMA]
He's gonna win!

185
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,583
Trying to catch
a few winks here, kids.

186
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,541
I'm dreadfully
sorry, mi--!

187
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,125
[KAZAMA]
That was a cheap shot!

188
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,416
[SAKURA] Eighty-two to
nothing, Roka's favor!

189
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,541
[KAZAMA] How long've
they been doing this?

190
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,833
[KAZAMA] And that's
my cue to leave.

191
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,208
[SIOU]
Ah, Kazama!

192
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,958
Good of you to come, sir.
Please take a seat!

193
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,833
[KAZAMA] You want me
to sit facing you?

194
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,125
I was sittin' there
a minute ago,

195
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,500
so it oughta be
nice and toasty.

196
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,041
[KAZAMA]
Shut up!

197
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,375
What, you're not sitting?

198
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,041
Since joining the club,
my traditional seat

199
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,125
has been this wall.

200
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,666
Okay. Whatever floats
your boat, man.

201
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,708
Not to labor the point,
but earlier was such a gas!

202
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,291
If you say so.

203
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,958
Wait, are you telling me the two
of you already know each other?

204
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,375
Oh, yes! Chance happily
saw our fraternizing

205
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,916
under the auspices of
Roka's Hood of Darkness.

206
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,916
[KAZAMA] Stop making
it sound like we

207
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,958
made out with each other!

208
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:05,958
[CHITOSE]
How bro-mantic.

209
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,166
[KAZAMA]
Stay out of this!

210
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,625
C'mon, we know
you better than that.

211
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,916
You probably spent
the whole time

212
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,666
kicking and
screaming like a girl.

213
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,083
Not really, but I'd
rather you picture that

214
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,208
than the alternative.

215
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,541
No hall fighting,
understood?

216
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,791
[KAZAMA]
Thank you!

217
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,041
So... Summarily snubbed
and cloaked in darkness,

218
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,166
the two of you
still fought over me?

219
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,208
[KAZAMA]
It wasn't over you!

220
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,333
I was fighting for
my masculinity!

221
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,916
Don't you tire
of the charade?

222
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,250
The only thing anybody's
tired of is your B.S.!

223
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,208
[SIOU] But you're holding
your own so well!

224
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,916
You have no clue.

225
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,541
[SIOU] In consequence of which,
permit me a modest proposal.

226
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,500
[KAZAMA]
What'd you just say?

227
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,166
[SIOU] I challenge thee to a
chivalric gaming tête-à-tête!

228
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,541
[KAZAMA]
Uh...

229
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,958
You mean two men are
going to fight each other

230
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,958
for the honor of my attention?

231
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,666
[SIOU] Yes! And the
victor claims your bag!

232
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,791
[ROKA]
Wait, the bag?

233
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,791
[SIOU] The gauntlet is thrown,
Kazama! What say you?

234
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:56,791
Well, can't say I give a damn
about the bag either way.

235
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,625
But I'm game for
kickin' your ass!

236
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,958
[SAKURA]
He sure is competitive.

237
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:04,958
[KAZAMA] Hold up.
We may have a problem.

238
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:08,000
Where is that stupid bag?

239
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,916
Hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

240
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,500
[KAZAMA]
Funabori?

241
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,000
Earlier when you and Siou were
bonding in the hall or whatever.

242
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,750
You left your S&amp;M
hood thingie there,

243
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,000
so I grabbed it
before anyone saw.

244
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,708
Looked a little on
the grubby side.

245
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,750
So I took it to the free
laundry mat over by the gym.

246
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,041
[KAZAMA]
What a thoughtful gal.

247
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,458
Excellent, good wench. I see
that wind of our imminent duel

248
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,625
has already
made the rounds!

249
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,958
[KAZAMA]
How?

250
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,416
Such is the reputation
of my foe. All the same...

251
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,500
No twinge of ingratitude
intended, you understand.

252
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,291
I much preferred the bag
in its sullied condition.

253
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,791
What for?

254
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,625
I'm sorry, if I'd have known,
I wouldn't have washed it!

255
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,750
No, it's okay; you've got
nothing to apologize for!

256
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,666
[SIOU] Indeed! Either way,
we now have our trophy!

257
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,000
Right!

258
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,333
Yeah. Something tells
me this is gonna be good.

259
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,041
[ROKA] One moment,
if you please.

260
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,166
I'd like to
point out the fact

261
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,916
of my exclusion
from a conversation

262
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,333
concerning the fate of
my personal property.

263
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,375
This duel will
now be a three-ul.

264
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,583
[KAZAMA]
You want in?

265
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:07,916
[MINAMI] I'll nap in
the teacher's lounge.

266
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,416
[KAZAMA]
Wait! Don't leave!

267
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,291
[SAKURA] Is it weird that I
feel like splashing my feet

268
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,375
in the bathroom sink?

269
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,083
[KAZAMA]
Aw, cut me some slack!

270
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,916
Ditch like a normal person!

271
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,666
[KAZAMA] Why are
we on our knees?

272
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,500
Choose what game our
devotion is to be tested by.

273
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,125
But milady, I must
protest your late entry.

274
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,791
This was to be a battle of
skill twixt Kazama and me!

275
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,166
Your involvement
is rather putting

276
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,750
the cart before the
horse, so to speak.

277
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,666
[KAZAMA]
Just let her play.

278
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,166
I don't know
about you guys,

279
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,666
but far as I'm concerned,
we've got a golden opportunity.

280
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,125
How do you mean?

281
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,708
[KAZAMA] Even though she's
the big boss around here,

282
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,041
I still can't bring
myself to hit a girl.

283
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,083
I would much rather face
her in a battle like this,

284
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,875
and I've been itchin'
to prove myself.

285
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,000
So say goodbye
to that bag.

286
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,916
I'm not worried in the least.

287
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,333
Pardon me. I'm beginning to
feel just a little left out.

288
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,541
Got it! Whaddya say we make
this no-man-left-behind?

289
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,833
Open tournament, all challengers
welcome, winner takes all!

290
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,083
Who asked for
your two cents?

291
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:10,333
[CHITOSE] D'aw.
Is widdle Kazama threatened?

292
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:14,083
Naw. I understand where
you're coming from. Heh.

293
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,166
[KAZAMA] Hey,
what're you sayin'?

294
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,541
Well, the more people
you're up against,

295
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,625
the better chances
you'll tank.

296
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,291
Who wouldn't be scared?
Pressure's bad enough

297
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,291
when it's just Roka and the
poet you're squarin' with, eh?

298
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,708
Argh! I'll take on
the whole school!

299
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,666
[FUNABORI]
So easily manipulated!

300
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,375
Two rivals or a thousand,
I can assure you

301
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,750
it makes no difference to me.

302
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:32,833
[FUNABORI]
So confident!

303
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,333
Well, provided they
act as a bulwark

304
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,750
against myself and the
possibility of hurting Roka.

305
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,625
[FUNABORI]
So chivalrous!

306
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,125
[ALL THREE] I'll crush anyone
with the guts to take me on!

307
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,958
Except for my darling.

308
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,291
[FUNABORI]
So much posturing!

309
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:51,291
Then count me in.
Get ready to burn!

310
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,416
[KAZAMA]
You, too?

311
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,958
[TAKAO]
Uh...

312
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,125
[CHITOSE] All right.
Four contestants. This is good.

313
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,000
[TAKAO]
Heh... Yeah.

314
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,291
Um, hello everyone and
thank you for joining us.

315
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,416
I'm Tsutsumi Inada.

316
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,791
I'll be your host
this afternoon

317
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,291
along with our distinguished
student body president.

318
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,083
Neck and groin
shots are allowed.

319
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,000
I've run it by the board.

320
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,708
Oh. So it's a
friendly competition.

321
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:32,791
All right, ladies and
germs, let's hear you

322
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,416
put those hands
together for the 48,

323
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,541
yes, 48 contestants
going toe-to-toe!

324
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,208
[crowd cheers]

325
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,541
Hey, doesn't that number seem
a little bit high to you guys?

326
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,791
Now, let's meet the
contenders one by one!

327
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,375
Texas Roasted Pork Muromi!

328
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,375
We've got some great
deals at the ramen shop.

329
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:52,416
[INADA] A man who likes his
odds even. Fifty-Fifty Fujisaki!

330
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,458
Here to avenge his pals, from
the Band of 14 Devils, Moro!

331
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,500
You won't remember
No-nickname Akasaka!

332
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,375
My personality's kinda flat.

333
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,333
[INADA] World-class decorator
and animal hoarder--

334
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,625
Wonderuff Meinohana!

335
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,416
Feng shui interior design, boys?

336
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,916
[INADA] The Twenty-four
Nocturnal Baldies

337
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,541
pin their hopes on Ohori.

338
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,041
And there's
"I'm Not Bald" Tenjin.

339
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,625
Look, I shave it this way!

340
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,291
[INADA] Also representing the
TNB are Nishijin and Fukuoka!

341
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,041
Next up, claiming to eat
his weight in junk food

342
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,458
seven times a day,
it's Little Foot Yokoshima...

343
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,583
[KAZAMA]
What a bunch of losers.

344
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,250
[INADA]
...from the Kazama Gang!

345
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,916
[INADA pants]

346
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,541
Okay! Now, moving
on to the brain trust

347
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,666
behind this bloody affair.

348
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,541
With a single smile, he can
steal your heart, and he's rich.

349
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,500
Hachi Siou from the Game
Creation Club (Provisional)!

350
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,875
Fujou Academy's
underground boss,

351
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,625
Game Creation Club
(Provisional)'s president--

352
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:38,875
Roka Shibasaki!

353
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,458
You don't know him now,
but he'll ring your bell

354
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,500
one of these days.
Kenji Kazama from...

355
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,041
The gang's
named after me!

356
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,875
And last but not least,
she's the pillowy president

357
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,541
of the real
Game Creation Club...

358
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,500
Is something wrong,
President Takao?

359
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,666
You want a homemade
gym bag that badly?

360
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,666
Huh! Asks the man clutching
it like a security blanket.

361
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,083
What? I hate this thing.

362
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,916
Then why are
we competing?

363
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,541
[TAKAO whimpers and cries]

364
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,833
Is she...
Is she groaning?

365
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:11,208
[CHITOSE] I'm sure she's just
trying on her game face.

366
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,500
I wouldn't worry about it.

367
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,791
Takao is as fearsome
as they come.

368
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,375
Then why's she
all buckled over?

369
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,250
[CHITOSE] Call it a
wardrobe malfunction.

370
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,250
[INADA gasps]

371
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,041
Oh, no! This is bad.

372
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,916
She can't get the zipper
up on her tracksuit!

373
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,250
Damn her voluminous curves!

374
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,083
Yes, damn them to hell!

375
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,708
[TAKAO] That's as far up
as this thing's gonna go.

376
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:37,208
Ugh. I would buy a new one,
but what's the point?

377
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,208
[CHITOSE &amp; INADA growl]

378
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,583
Stop tryin' to show off!

379
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,875
Aargh! Exhibitionist hag!

380
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,791
[KAZAMA] Girls do the
whole friend thing weird.

381
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,166
[INADA]
I bet they're not even real!

382
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,000
[CHITOSE] I hate you and
your two reasons for living!

383
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,916
Don't, it'll break!

384
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,541
[INADA &amp; CHITOSE gasp]

385
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,250
[TAKAO groans]

386
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,333
[ALL gasp]

387
00:16:56,416 --> 00:17:00,291
[INADA]
And they're in!

388
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,791
I knew she'd wall in those
Titans one way or another!

389
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,375
Two seconds ago
I'd've put good money

390
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,208
on that zipper tab endin'
up in someone's eye.

391
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,291
That was some impressive
damage control.

392
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,500
I think we've all learned
an important lesson.

393
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,958
Well, that about wraps it up
everybody; let's call it day.

394
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,000
[KAZAMA]
Like hell!

395
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,791
What? What else
are you expecting?

396
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,875
You're gonna cut your
circulation off like that.

397
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:22,083
It's not good for you, y'know.
Open it back up.

398
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,416
I will not!

399
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,041
[KAZAMA] I'm just tryin'
to look out for you, okay?

400
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,708
You're looking
out for... oh, no!

401
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:28,958
[KAZAMA]
Huh?

402
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,833
Uh, okey-dokie, now that
the crowd's warmed up,

403
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,125
let's get this show on the road.
According to my sources

404
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,000
in the office, we've only
got the field 'til three.

405
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,541
[KAZAMA]
Then stay on topic!

406
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,958
Oh, that's right,
we've still gotta talk

407
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,125
about the grand prize.

408
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,166
Don't you know it's
the announcer's job

409
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,791
to keep the ball rolling?

410
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:43,833
Somebody call pest control.

411
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,291
We've got a
mosquito in the ring.

412
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,541
[KAZAMA]
'Scuse me?!

413
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,375
And the winner of this
tournament takes home

414
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,416
the grandest prize of all!

415
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,708
The Hood of Darkness!

416
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:55,041
[silence punctuated
by whistling wind]

417
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,541
Is that seriously
all we've got?

418
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:57,750
[KAZAMA]
You're the host!

419
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:58,916
[GUY A]
Okay, then...

420
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,416
[GUY B] The hell is
that supposed to be?

421
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,875
[KAZAMA] They don't even know
what they're fighting for?

422
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,541
Don't judge a book
by its cover.

423
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,333
There's more to this than
meets the eye, fellas.

424
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,875
This bag was
freshly laundered

425
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,583
by none other than
Funabori herself!

426
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,416
[GUY STUDENTS cheer]

427
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,375
Now they're on
the bandwagon. Sheesh.

428
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,666
[NAKASU] Heh.
Last-minute entry, losers.

429
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,083
[KAWABATA]
Must have!

430
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,916
[INADA] Aha! Looks like we've
got two new contestants!

431
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,458
[KAZAMA]
Really?

432
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,291
[INADA] Nakasu and Kawabata
from the 24 Nocturnal Baldies!

433
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,625
[KAZAMA] Is the
whole group in this?

434
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,958
Can we please
do this already?

435
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,000
They're gonna kick us off
before we've started!

436
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,958
[INADA] Looks like
somebody's impatient.

437
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,916
When you entered, you were
each asked to write a game

438
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,333
on a slip of paper
and place it in this box.

439
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,708
The first randomly selected
strip will be how we separate

440
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:47,625
the meek from the mighty!
Our opening contest is... Aha!

441
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:50,583
For some reason, I'm holding
a slip that says "piss."

442
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,791
Uh... I don't get it,
like a pissing contest?

443
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,291
Not quite sure how
I feel about this,

444
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,000
but I suppose rules are rules.
The boys will have to use

445
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,750
a different unit of
measurement than the girls.

446
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,875
[KAZAMA] That's not what
it means! Were you serious?

447
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,666
Oh, uh... I believe
it's an acronym

448
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,375
for Push It Super Strong.

449
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,333
The object is to shove
your opponent off a mat.

450
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,083
[KAZAMA] Don't act like
you didn't put it in there!

451
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,500
Makes sense, I guess.

452
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,458
Right then, push your opponent
for all they're worth!

453
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,875
Whichever of you's left standing
moves on to round two!

454
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,125
And begin!

455
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,000
[whistle]

456
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,833
Thanks for giving
us a warning!

457
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,500
[MORO]
Die!

458
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,208
Hey, Moro, you're not
half bad at this.

459
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,458
Yeah? Well, what do
you care, Roasted Pork?

460
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,500
Think you're big enough to
take me down a notch or two?

461
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,041
I'm gonna be the one to bring
down the ultimate darkness!

462
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,958
You shouldn't be
any trouble at all!

463
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,458
[MUROMI] Oh! Are you
sure you wanna be

464
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,333
talkin' to me like that?

465
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,666
'Cause I could always
stop servin' you

466
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,458
delicious meats when you
come to my restaurant.

467
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,000
[MORO]
You... Wait, what?

468
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,083
[MUROMI laughs]

469
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,875
[MUROMI]
Well, what's it gonna be?

470
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,125
[MORO] Damn.
Sorry, you guys!

471
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,291
[INADA] In an
unprecedented move,

472
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,375
Moro has leapt
willingly from the ring!

473
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,375
Ah. Easy as pie.

474
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,375
No spicy mayonnaise for you!

475
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,333
What the hell are you
even talkin' about, dude?

476
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,583
Condiments!

477
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:05,916
Man, ain't nobody got
time to deal with you

478
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,791
and your crazy right now.
She's out there!

479
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,458
And she's got a new move!

480
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:17,166
[MUROMI] No, please,
make it stop!

481
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,375
[INADA] And Shibasaki kills
two birds with one stone!

482
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,041
[FUJISAKI laughs]

483
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,791
[FUJISAKI] Well, well!
Lookie who's all mine!

484
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,583
It's cool, mama, nothin'
personal, but I gots to go

485
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:33,500
the way the compass points!
And it says I should push!

486
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,625
[INADA] Callin' the shots with
a child's novelty compass,

487
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,458
Fujisaki overcomes
his indecisiveness

488
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,833
to close in for the kill!

489
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah, a nice, soft
cushion-push from the front.

490
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,583
Apparently, that
pervert's only here

491
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:46,750
on the off chance of tickling
Takao's titanic ta-tas!

492
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,291
[FUJISAKI moans]

493
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,250
[TAKAO screams]

494
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,375
[FUJISAKI]
Augh!

495
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,583
Jackass. If you're not
gonna play the game,

496
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,375
then get off the platform.

497
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,333
[KAZAMA] Wh-Why
would you do that?

498
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,708
I was defending your honor!

499
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:07,708
[TAKAO] I... I just...
I don't know!

500
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,416
The idea of you going
home with that bag

501
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,708
makes me sick to
my stomach, okay?

502
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,375
Wha--? Why does
that even matter?

503
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,291
[TAKAO]
Be... Because... I...

504
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,375
[CHITOSE &amp; INADA]
Ahhh!

505
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,375
[GUY STUDENTS cheer]

506
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,708
[INADA] And the
zipper is broken!

507
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,958
Boobzilla, ladies
and gentlemen! Give it up!

508
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,291
[CHITOSE]
You hussy! Tramp!

509
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,750
[INADA] Yeah! Ya two-bit
floozy! Nobody likes you!

510
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,791
[TAKAO] Hey.
Are you all right?

511
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,375
[INADA]
They're huge.

512
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,000
I hate to admit it, but we
have to face the facts.

513
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:44,041
That girl's eons ahead of us
in the curve department.

514
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,041
[CHITOSE &amp; INADA]
Mm.

515
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,666
[TAKAO] C'mon!
Snap out of it!

516
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,416
[INADA] Time's up!
Everyone still standing

517
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,250
moves on to the second
round! Good for you!

518
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,125
[TAKAO] Wait, I...
I made the cut?

519
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,625
[ATARU] Da-da-da! Legend of
the Heroic Masochist, Ataru!

520
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:37,458
Bring your A-game, Kenji!
You an' me. Mano y mano!

521
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,875
[YOKOSHIMA]
Guys, check it out!

522
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:41,208
Not to sound cheezy, but
we're in this together, yeah?

523
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:43,166
Uh, okay, sure.

524
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,375
[ALL THREE]
Besties!

525
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,541
[ATARU] See you guys
in the final round!

526
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,166
[INADA]
And begin!

527
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:52,333
[GUY A]
Help me!

528
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,125
[GUY B]
She's gonna eat us!

529
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:56,166
[crowd screams]

530
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,916
[ATARU]
Yokoshima! Nagayama!

531
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,750
[ATARU growls]

532
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,416
[YOKOSHIMA] You got this, man!
Don't be intimidated!

533
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,041
The bigger they are, the harder
they fall! Stay strong!

534
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,875
How'm I gonna see you
jackasses in the final round

535
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,416
if you cave this early
in the tournament?

536
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,041
Ataru!

537
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:11,625
Besties, right? I'm gonna
mow down the competition

538
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:14,541
and win this one for my homies!
Besides, I'm kinda curious

539
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,208
to see what it's like
to be trampled!

540
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:18,916
Ya gotta respect a man with the
courage to follow his dream.

541
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,416
[ALL THREE scream]

542
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:26,458
[ATARU] Yep! That one's
gonna leave a mark!
