00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,375
...like insult her hair?

318
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,333
You never did say
which style was best.

[KAZAMA]
What?

320
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,083
I'm telling you, I'll
come in handy. Eh?

321
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,166
[KAZAMA]
Ugh!

322
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,291
If you're not here
to wear her down,

323
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,541
then what the hell'd
you come back for?

324
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,625
[KAZAMA]
Huh?

325
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,458
I'm not afraid of you!
Whatever you got, Tama,

326
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,166
I can take it and then some!

327
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,583
[KAZAMA]
Why are you so excited?

328
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:40,958
I don't mean to complain,

329
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,125
but is a shield allowed
to use another shield?

330
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,666
I'm gonna go ahead
and allow it. Clear.

331

What the...

332

No worries. Heh.

[KAZAMA]
Ataru, no!

336
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,916
I... I think you
cracked his sternum.

337
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,166
Yeah, probably.

338
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,750
If you're scared,
you could just walk away.

339
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,333
[TAMA] Since you were the
guy that defeated Roka,

340
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,750
I was really hoping to see
what you're made of.

341
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:17,041
Guess the secret ingredient
was dumb luck, huh?

342
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,583
Not another word, missy!

343
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,833
No one trash-talks my friend
and gets away with it!

344
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,333
Sure, he may
look like a weakling,

345
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,916
but luck is not what
brought him to this pass,

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,791
oh, no!

The cards have been stacked

against this waif
from the very beginning!

349
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,333
[KAZAMA] You don't have
to put it like that!

350
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:32,416
[TAMA] Either way, he's not
really much of a fighter.

351
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,458
I think we can all agree
Kazama's out of his depth.

352
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,791
[KAZAMA]
Ow!

353
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,083
Now for my next trick.

00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,666
Pushing you out of the ring!

355
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,541
Accident.

00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,291
[KAZAMA]
What?

357
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,000
Look, I just happened
to be standing here.

358
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,833
You really expect me
to believe that?

359
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,000
Whatever, all right?

360
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,666
I don't want to see
the club shut down

361
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,916
over something trivial.

When you make a stand,

I can't help but
want to root for you.

365
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:07,750
But like I said,

366
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,916
I--I was just on my
way to the restroom.

Oh, uh... safe!

00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,833
[CHITOSE] He didn't
beat Roka with luck.

369
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,833
The boy's got some game.
He's the scrappy outsider type.

Shield Number Two?

00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,208
You better not let
Tama have her way.

373
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,583
Because you're not
joining my club

if this one shuts down.

Come on, man.
I believe in you.

But if you get your butt kicked,

378
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,416
we can go back to
the way things were.

You're not helping!

Uh, 'scuse me, Takao,

You have some
great moves, kid.

I think you were
holding back too much

00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,166
for us to say it was a tie.

I have no idea what
you're talking about.

The question on your
cell phone gave it away.

Anybody could've answered it.

00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,375
All I can assume is that
you never intended to win.

00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,250
Well, with Tama
still in the running,

399
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,166
the game's far from decided.

400
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,291
I'm not too worried.

00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,708
When you get right down to it,

00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,958
the peeps in my club
are pretty strong.

403

Roka and Chitose are certainly
nothing to sneeze at.

404

But what's your take
on that Kazama guy?

405
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,000
I'd say he's
reasonably average.

That's too bad.

really matter.

he'll just pull out a set of
brass knuckles,

Oh, actually, he did.

Way to mess up the moment
by using that stupid nickname.
