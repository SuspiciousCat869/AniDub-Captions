1
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,583
[JOE] Curse those
Pervy Melonians!

2
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,833
Why do they keep hounding me?
Who chases someone

3
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:52,458
across the galaxy for a paltry
five thousand porn mags?

4
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,500
Do the bastards have
nothing better to do?

5
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,625
[ROBOT 5A] We're in
deep trouble, boss!

6
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:03,458
[JOE] So, this is where
my luck runs out, huh?

7
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,166
[JOE]
Huh? Wait a second.

8
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,375
That cargo vessel belongs
to my nemesis, Mr. Kids.

9
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:14,750
Why is he rescuing me?

10
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,041
If I lose my only rival,

11
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,916
what's the point of
my existence? Ya dig?

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,125
Thanks, Mr. Kids.
I owe ya one.

13
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:24,208
I swear by all the
stars in the Universe,

14
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,666
I'll pay you back someday.

15
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,083
Well, that someday's
today, buddy,

16
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:28,500
so fork over the porn mags.

17
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,916
What? Right now?

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,125
[ROKA whimpers]

19
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:36,000
[MR. KIDS] Survival of
the fittest, bitch.

20
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,833
[CHITOSE]
Hmph.

21
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,458
In short, this game
allows you to steal

22
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:43,291
other players' cards, as you
just witnessed first-hand.

23
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,875
You can't send your
opponent all the way back

24
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,083
to the start, but it's a great
way to weaken the competition

25
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,041
and position yourself
for certain victory.

26
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,791
That's so true. It's the best
way to cut down the opposition,

27
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,291
close the gap between
you and first place,

28
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:55,291
and claim intergalactic
dominance.

29
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,666
Did you get that, Kazama?
Any questions?

30
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,583
[CHITOSE] Yeah, you
following us, champ?

31
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:03,666
Uh... Yeah, I guess.

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,166
[STUDENTS] Fight on!

33
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,916
--[TEACHER] Fight on!
--[STUDENTS] Fight on!

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,416
Look, are you gonna play
the game with us or not?

35
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,083
Unless I'm mistaken here,
you're the one who wanted

36
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,041
to thank us for saving
you from the Devils!

37
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,458
So in return, we
said you could play

38
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,625
"The Scramble for Porn
Mags in Space Game!"

39
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,208
How dare you snub it?

40
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:52,250
Sorry to be rude, but this
game is really stupid!

41
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,833
Ow!

42
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,291
[CHITOSE] We worked our butts
off on this concept, you know?

43
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,625
And then you come along
and have the nerve

44
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,458
to say, "I don't
wanna play it!"

45
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,791
Oh! I get it, His Highness
the Foot Fetish King

46
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,208
has better things to do!

47
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,791
Does this get your
rocket runnin', pervert?

48
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,958
Please, there's some really
gross stuff on your shoe!

49
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,083
Why is this club
always so noisy?

50
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,625
Would you guys mind
keeping it down a little bit?

51
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,250
Whoa, wait a sec, what
are you even doing here?

52
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,791
Well, my club doesn't have a
meeting today. So I dropped by

53
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:19,000
to make sure you're behaving
like a real club does.

54
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,833
Who died and made
you Queen Bee?

55
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,666
Aw, I get it. You must not
have very many friends.

56
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,625
I mean, all of your club-mates
are underclassman losers!

57
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,791
Shut your filthy mouth!

58
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,250
[ROKA]
Now, now.

59
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,916
You can be honest
with us--the real reason

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,416
you've come here today
is to join in our game!

61
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,375
I'd rather have a root canal.

62
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,666
Here's the rundown.
No matter what it takes,

63
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,583
you have to convince Takao
that she wants to play with us.

64
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,541
Aw, man, come on!

65
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,875
[KAZAMA]
Wait a second.

66
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,416
If I remember right,
this is a four-person game.

67
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,833
If I drag Takao into this,
we'll be up to five players.

68
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,166
In other words, we'll be
one player over the limit.

69
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,958
Meaning they won't
need me anymore!

70
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,375
Now I'm thinking
on the same level

71
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:00,083
as that guy from the
Band of Fourteen Devils.

72
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,083
Hey!

73
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,083
Whaddaya want?

74
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,250
I thought ya loved
to play games.

75
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:06,958
Huh? I like games,
just not stupid ones.

76
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,416
Why not give it a chance?

77
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,916
Who knows?
You might be surprised.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,625
[TAKAO]
I'm not playing that crap.

79
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:15,083
No need to be so harsh.
Come on, do it for me.

80
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,000
[TAKAO groans]

81
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,875
I saved you from the
Band of Fourteen Devils!

82
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,791
It's me who's owed the favor!

83
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,583
Yeah, I know. And I
really appreciate the help.

84
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,833
But in this case, it's kinda
apples and oranges, you know?

85
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:30,291
And I pushed myself
so hard back there.

86
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:33,875
[TAKAO cries]

87
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,958
Fine! Then let's call it two
favors I owe you now, okay?

88
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,458
Help me out and I'll do
anything you say! Please!

89
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,791
He's really getting
desperate, you guys.

90
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,458
[TAKAO] He'll do
anything I say, huh?

91
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,541
Guess there's no
convincing her.

92
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,166
[TAKAO]
Very well. I'm in.

93
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,500
Huh? You mean...
Wait, seriously?

94
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,291
[TAKAO]
Mm hmm.

95
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,916
Like for real?

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,125
But my favors don't
exactly come cheap.

97
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,291
Fine by me!

98
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,875
Good work, Kazama,
you did it!

99
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,250
Yeah!

100
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,458
This is great! Now all five
of us can play together!

101
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah!

102
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,708
What the hell?

103
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,750
But I thought the stupid
game was four-player?

104
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,583
Yes. Well, uh...
Games evolve!

105
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,291
[KAZAMA] The only evolution
is how badly I got screwed.

106
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,833
[KAZAMA]
Psych?

107
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,083
It's too late to go
back on your word,

108
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,458
if that's what you're thinking!

109
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,666
[KAZAMA shudders]

110
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,958
Fine! I'll be a man
and make good on this,

111
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,208
but it's only in an effort
to make you happy!

112
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,458
Wait, you dragged
a girl into it,

113
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,208
and you still
call yourself a man?

114
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,708
[KAZAMA]
Low blow!

115
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,250
Well, it's time to pick which
characters you wanna play.

116
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,333
Look, I don't care,
just give me whatever.

117
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,708
Same goes for me.

118
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,791
Lucky for you, there're
only two cards to pick from.

119
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,458
[GAINDHI] Worldly
things are transient.

120
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,958
[PERVENDER] I'm not a
pervert, I'm just horny.

121
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,833
I call dibs on Gaindhi!

122
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,333
No way, obviously you
should be the pervert guy!

123
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:54,791
[CHITOSE] The new character
isn't very popular.

124
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,458
[SAKURA] But he's the
only alien in the game.

125
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,541
Seems like people
would be into that.

126
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,333
Hey! How 'bout we throw
my "Joe" card in the mix?

127
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,708
We can play
"Rock, Paper, Scissors"

128
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,375
to decide who gets who.

129
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,833
Yeah, but Roka, you were so
attached to your Joe character.

130
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,291
It's fine, really. More than
anything, I'm just glad to be

131
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,250
sharing the game I made with
the people I care about most.

132
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,458
--[CHITOSE] Roka!
--[SAKURA] So sweet!

133
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,708
[KAZAMA] If she's so sweet,
why not just give me the card?

134
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,833
[KAZAMA, ROKA &amp; TAKAO] 
One, two, three!

135
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,791
I forgot to mention
the rule for this game

136
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,000
is "best two out of three."

137
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,833
[KAZAMA] She's pulling
a bait and switch!

138
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,791
[ROKA] I made a compromise
just by offering this deal,

139
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,125
so I expect you to
play by my rules.

140
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,750
Man. If I end up
with the pervert,

141
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,375
I'm gonna be pissed.

142
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,208
You and me both.

143
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,625
[KAZAMA, ROKA &amp; TAKAO] 
One, two, three!

144
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:44,916
Yay! I won!

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Man!

146
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,416
Victory is mine,
and so is Gaindhi!

147
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,625
[KAZAMA] No!
Not my Gaindhi!

148
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,333
Wait a sec, if she snags
the Gaindhi card,

149
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,000
wouldn't that leave me with Joe?

150
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,125
What make you think
you're going to beat me

151
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,750
so easily in the next round?

152
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,041
[KAZAMA] 'Cause all you
ever throw out is "rock."

153
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,916
Joe! You're all mine, buddy!

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,291
[KAZAMA, ROKA &amp; TAKAO] 
One, two, three!

155
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,583
[KAZAMA] What the
hell does that mean?

156
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,291
According to the rules
I created, it means "time out."

157
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,875
The "thumbs up" allows me to
freeze the game for two minutes.

158
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,541
How is a "time out"
gonna help you?

159
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,708
[CHITOSE] Heh. You really
don't get it, do you?

160
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:17,958
Calling a "time out"
at this point

161
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,875
is the worst possible
thing that could happen.

162
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,750
She has two whole minutes
to wear down your spirits

163
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,583
and willpower until you have
nothing left to hold on to.

164
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,333
Is it me, or is this
sounding less and less

165
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,166
like "Rock, Paper, Scissors"?

166
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,208
As of this moment, the fateful
two minutes have already begun.

167
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:35,750
Intimidation level one.
Browbeating swan!

168
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,208
Oh, please!

169
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,250
Like you can intimidate me
with something that derpy!

170
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,083
[ROKA]
Suck on this!

171
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,250
Hey, you can't just
swan jab me in the face!

172
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,625
[ROKA grunts]

173
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,375
[ROKA]
Take this, Takao!

174
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,833
[TAKAO]
Stop poking my breasts.

175
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,333
[ROKA] Eventually,
you two will grow insecure

176
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,625
and you'll lose all
hope of beating me!

177
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,750
But don't worry, your boobs
won't get smaller!

178
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,291
[KAZAMA]
Cut it out!

179
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,791
[KAZAMA, ROKA &amp; TAKAO] 
One, two, three!

180
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,375
[ROKA]
Oh, no!

181
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,541
You've already mastered my
technique for calling time out?

182
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:05,541
[KAZAMA] I can't
believe she didn't see

183
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,458
the potential for backfire.

184
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,541
I know what comes next.
You're going to torture me

185
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,083
and affect all manner
of terrible things

186
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,000
to chip away at my resolve,
aren't you, Kazama?

187
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,583
[KAZAMA] Okay. Not quite
the reaction I was hoping for.

188
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:18,875
Time out!

189
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,166
[KAZAMA] What the hell?
You're using it on me?

190
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,666
Tell me your favorite
food now. Go!

191
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,125
[KAZAMA]
A psychological attack, eh?

192
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,875
Do you have a hobby?
When you have free time,

193
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,166
what do you like to do?

194
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,500
What's the point in
askin' me all this stuff?

195
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,666
So, tell me about
your childhood.

196
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,333
What are some of your
fondest memories?

197
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,291
Ugh, who cares?

198
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,333
Stop dodging all my questions

199
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,500
and just come out
with it already!

200
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,166
You wanna know?
Then take back that favor!

201
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,875
[TAKAO] These are questions
you can answer on the house!

202
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,708
[KAZAMA] My personal info
doesn't run cheap!

203
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,750
All right, that is quite enough
back and forth, you two!

204
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,250
We'll never get
anywhere at this rate!

205
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,625
[KAZAMA] Nah, I'd say
it'll get somewhere

206
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,166
in a minute,
when you lose.

207
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,833
[ROKA] Well. I always thought
I would command more respect

208
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,541
as President of the
Game Creation Club.

209
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:55,125
[TAKAO] Game Creation Club
Provisional, technically.

210
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,666
[ROKA]
Very well.

211
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,166
Guess I have no choice but to
trump you in the next round.

212
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,875
[KAZAMA] Not very likely,
with the way you play.

213
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:05,750
Here we go! One, two...

214
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,416
[KAZAMA, ROKA &amp; TAKAO] 
Three!

215
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,250
Come on, Now what is
that supposed to be?

216
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:13,416
New club rule. It gets
carried over to next time.

217
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,208
[ROKA] Having said that,
it's getting late,

218
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,916
so I propose we wrap
this up and call it a day.

219
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:26,416
Oh, Chitose, I think it would be
prudent to add another character

220
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,916
before the next meeting.
A non-pervert human.

221
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,125
[CHITOSE]
Okay!

222
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,625
[KAZAMA] Madam
President plays dirty!

223
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,958
[NARRATOR] But by using these
rules in subsequent meetings.

224
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:39,333
Kazama and the others still
haven't played this game.

225
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:55,000
[KAZAMA yawns]

226
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,708
[KAZAMA]
Man, I'm starving.

227
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,916
[GUY 5A] Hey, did you hear
the news? Word on the street

228
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,583
is Kazama and his gang beat
the Band of Fourteen Devils.

229
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,125
[OHORI] What?
Are you freakin' serious?

230
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,750
The Band of Fourteen Devils?
Whoa. That's awesome.

231
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,291
[KAZAMA] Well, sounds like our
cool factor went up thanks to

232
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,666
the fight we had with
those rhythm game d-bags.

233
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,291
[GUY 5A] Kazama and
the others are basically

234
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,291
Roka's glorified lackeys;
at least that's what I heard.

235
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,041
You best check yourself before
you wreck yourself, ya punks!

236
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,000
Kazama, I'm really sorry, bro!

237
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,750
Now you listen and
you listen good--

238
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,416
Kazama's his own man.

239
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,166
Kazama, we came all the way here
so you could eat lunch with us!

240
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,208
[KAZAMA] Crap, they're
coming for me!

241
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,833
[GUY 5A] Check it out,
you guys, look who's here!

242
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,541
[OHORI] Our inimitable student
body President, Chitose!

243
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,333
[KAZAMA]
She's "inimitable" now?

244
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,083
[OHORI] And that's the school's
underground boss lady.

245
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,375
Roka Shibasaki!

246
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,333
[GUY 5A]
Look how tiny she is!

247
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,333
[KAZAMA] If she's
so underground,

248
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,000
how come they know about her?

249
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,625
[KAZAMA]
No, not that!

250
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:54,958
[KAZAMA]
It's working?

251
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,625
She's so powerful.
Wow. She's the real deal!

252
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,583
[KAZAMA] Come on,
it's just her hand!

253
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,208
[ROKA] So.
You ready to eat?

254
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,875
Someone wanna tell me
what you two are doing here?

255
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,333
Roka saw your left
hand and insisted

256
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,958
we come by and check on you.

257
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,416
[KAZAMA]
My left hand?

258
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,625
Yeah. You injured
it in the fight

259
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,833
and I thought that you
might need assistance.

260
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,750
After all, it's hard to use
chopsticks with a broken hand.

261
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,541
Honestly, that's it.
I wanted to offer my help

262
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,541
in case you found it
difficult eating on your own.

263
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:22,750
Come on!

264
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,083
[TAKAO] Aw, man!
Why didn't I think of that?

265
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,291
[ROKA] It would be my
pleasure to serve you!

266
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,625
[FUKUNISHI]
Wait, what?

267
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,041
Thanks, but I'm fine.
It's healing pretty good.

268
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,791
Besides, it doesn't really
matter, I'm right-handed.

269
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,041
It still seems like a
perfect time to eat.

270
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,333
[KAZAMA] You mean
you're not gonna leave?

271
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,458
Sit down, you're only
fighting the inevitable.

272
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,333
Yeah, she does
make a valid point.

273
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,041
Shut up! Why do I
have to eat my lunch

274
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,958
at my desk next to
you two psychos?

275
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,166
I'm getting outta here.

276
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,250
[ROKA] That's weird.
It doesn't bother you

277
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,458
to bring your own lunch even
though you're a delinquent?

278
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,041
Tch! Why do you care?

279
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,541
[CHITOSE laughs]

280
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:58,750
[CHITOSE] I know everything
there is to know about that.

281
00:12:58,833 --> 00:12:59,750
[KAZAMA]
Hm?

282
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,250
Truth is, he doesn't make it.

283
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,791
Kazama's little sister packs
all of his lunches for him!

284
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,291
[ROKA]
You gotta be kidding me!

285
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,500
No way. Your sister
makes your lunches?

286
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,291
Sorry, bro, you just lost
all your cool points!

287
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,375
This isn't my fault.
My sister has a thing

288
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,833
about not wasting money on
school lunches, all right?

289
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,041
[ROKA]
Give that here, Kazama!

290
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,666
I have to confirm the
contents for myself!

291
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,708
Hey, at least wash
your hands first!

292
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,041
Good news, there doesn't appear
to be anything weird inside.

293
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,458
It would be kinda
lame if there were

294
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,875
little heart-shaped dishes
or pink chopsticks.

295
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:31,958
Ya know, all things
considered,

296
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,958
this is actually
somewhat acceptable.

297
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,708
[KAZAMA] You morons love giving
me a hard time, don't you?

298
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,333
Damn. I was hoping that
no one would find out!

299
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,083
Sorry, but the cat's
out of the bag now.

300
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,666
I even found out which first
year class your sister's in!

301
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,000
But I wouldn't worry if I
were you. There's dirt on

302
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,750
nearly everybody in my trusty
little secret notebook here!

303
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,916
How does that help me?!

304
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,250
And besides,
that's not even yours.

305
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,041
That has Ataru's name on it!

306
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,250
Everything
I own is mine,

307
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,791
and everything of his
I feel like taking

308
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,083
and manipulating for
my purposes is mine too!

309
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,916
[KAZAMA] Where have
I heard that before?!

310
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,416
You know, this is
rather delicious.

311
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
[KAZAMA]
Damn you!

312
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,875
It's so good.
You think your sister

313
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:05,916
wants to be my girlfriend?

314
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,083
No way, I want her!

315
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,458
No, me!

316
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,875
You jerks have really
crossed the line this time!

317
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,583
[ROKA] Don't be upset.
I'll share my food with you;

318
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,333
that way everybody wins!

319
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,750
All right, hand it over
already, or I'm not gonna

320
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,833
have time to eat
before my next class.

321
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,625
Wait. Are you saying
that you attend class

322
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,125
even though you're a low-life,
"scum of the earth" delinquent?

323
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,166
Only cause the next one's
Mr. Konekone's course

324
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,583
in Japanese classics.
He's a real cool guy.

325
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,041
A real cool guy?

326
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,333
Well, he's, uh... I don't
know how to say it.

327
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,458
I guess you could say
I owe him my life.

328
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,958
[CHITOSE] Weird, that doesn't
show up anywhere in my book.

329
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,666
That's 'cause only the
Kazama Gang knows

330
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,875
what happened firsthand.
But, if you really wanna know,

331
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,041
I might be willing to
give you the full scoop.

332
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,791
Yes, please!

333
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,958
[STUDENTS] Are we
transitioning into a flashback?

334
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,916
So this is when I was
still in Elementary School.

335
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,833
[TAKAO] What the heck?
And that hoodlum had the nerve

336
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,875
to tell me his info
doesn't come cheap!

337
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,875
Ataru and his guys
came to get me.

338
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,250
They took me to a roof top.

339
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,500
The plan was to
watch a hero show.

340
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,125
[KIDS]
Fire!

341
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,666
[YOUNG KAZAMA] Ataru!
We're gonna die up here

342
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,166
'cause you wanted
to watch RaGaiGar!

343
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,625
[YOUNG YOKOSHIMA] Yeah,
this is all your fault!

344
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,750
[YOUNG ATARU] All we have to
do is make it to that terrace!

345
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,125
[YOUNG KAZAMA]
But we're up so high!

346
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,666
Dude. That young
announcer lady

347
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,958
jumped down a second
ago and she was okay!

348
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,375
[LADY] I hope I live
to see my husband

349
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:21,333
and three daughters one
more time! Help is on the way!

350
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,833
[KIDS]
Whoa! She's awesome!

351
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,916
[YOUNG KAZAMA]
That lady wasn't normal.

352
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,833
She was like a
super-human freak!

353
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,750
[YOUNG ATARU] You got
any other bright ideas?

354
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,291
Judging by how
fluffy my body is,

355
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,083
if I do a belly flop
onto the concrete,

356
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,166
I think I might
be okay. Gulp.

357
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,791
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that's a terrible idea.

358
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,666
I'm in decent shape,
all things considered.

359
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,708
Maybe I can climb my way down
and go get some help? Gulp.

360
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:45,958
Dude, you're not
in good shape,

361
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,500
you're a scrawny little
elementary school kid,

362
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,791
I'm gonna go out on a limb
here and say "no way"!

363
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,458
[Fellas, I think I
can survive the fall.

364
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,125
The truth is I've been
developing an immunity

365
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:56,875
to the pain caused by jumping
off of buildings! Gulp.

366
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,500
Clearly you
just made that up!

367
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,541
[RAGAIGAR] I'm RaGaiGar,
the superhero.

368
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,666
I have the power to crush
boulders with my bare hands

369
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,958
and leap twenty yards
straight into the air.

370
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,500
This height should
be nothing for me.

371
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:10,083
Don't worry kids,
I'll be fine! Heroic Gulp!

372
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,375
[YOUNG KAZAMA] Shut up!
You're a dude in a costume!

373
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,041
You kids all right?
I've come to rescue you!

374
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,916
[RAGAIGAR &amp; KIDS]
Awesome!

375
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,291
[KONEKONE] Okay, everybody,
here's the plan,

376
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,458
we'll use this rope to
climb down to the terrace!

377
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,458
[RAGAIGAR] Yay! He saved us!
Thank you so much, sir!

378
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,500
That's very kind. But if
you want to thank someone,

379
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,250
thank the wonderful lady
who informed me there were

380
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,958
kids trapped on the roof
of a burning building

381
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,333
who desperately
needed my assistance.

382
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,333
[KIDS] Let's get
out of here!

383
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:40,041
[KONEKONE]
There! Come on!

384
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,958
Hurry up now,
before it's too late!

385
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:47,291
Hm? You too! We're running
out of time! Hm?

386
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't wanna be in debt to some
old fart that I barely know.

387
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,166
There's no telling what he'll
want from me down the road!

388
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,916
This isn't the
time for that!

389
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,833
Hm. I have to agree.

390
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,416
[KIDS]
Ah?

391
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,708
So... in exchange
for me helping you,

392
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,791
I only ask that if you see
someone else in need,

393
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,375
you'll do everything you can to
help them. If you agree to that,

394
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,958
I'm willing to write off
all of today's debt.

395
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,750
So whaddaya say?
Do we have a deal?

396
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:17,333
Uh... Hm. Yeah, that
sounds good to me.

397
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,583
[KONEKONE laughs]

398
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,208
Kid, I think you'll make
a decent man one day.

399
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,583
[RAGAIGAR] Uh. Can I
climb down that rope too?

400
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,833
[KONEKONE] Hm? Of course.
Though you might consider

401
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,333
taking off that
silly outfit first.

402
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,833
[KAZAMA] That's the story
of how Shaun Konekone

403
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,666
saved our lives one fateful day.

404
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,791
It just so happens that I ran
into him again here at school.

405
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,666
[ATARU]
Such a lovely flashback...

406
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,250
You were here
the whole time?

407
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,666
The idea that somehow
the touching events

408
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,333
of that great story
helped to shape and mold

409
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:50,000
the person you've become
today pisses me off.

410
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,541
[KAZAMA] Okay, who
is it that hurt you?

411
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,833
I had no idea the great
superhero RaGaiGar

412
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,541
was such a sensitive person.

413
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,458
That's really all you got
from my awesome story?

414
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,583
 Aw, you gotta be kidding me!
You idiots ate the whole thing!

415
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,166
I'm very sorry.
To make up for

416
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,750
the terrible thing I've done,
you can eat my lunch instead.

417
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,083
[KAZAMA] Right,
like that's gonna get me

418
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,125
through the rest
of the day.

419
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,458
[ROKA] Oh, stop
being such a grump.

420
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,750
My little sister made
me a delicious... eh...

421
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,500
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
I ate earlier

422
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,958
on account of being famished.

423
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,750
[KAZAMA]
What are you, hollow?

424
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,583
Stop being such a baby.

425
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,250
Say ahh!

426
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,208
[CHITOSE]
Uh? Aw...

427
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,458
[CHITOSE]
Ahh?

428
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:36,958
You're outta your mind.
I can't eat that filthy thing!

429
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,416
So it's not clean
enough for ya,

430
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,625
guess we'll have to see
about that, won't we?

431
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,916
If I remember right,
she's in this class.

432
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,416
Hey! Funabori,
you got a second?

433
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,041
Hi. You need me?

434
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,041
[CHITOSE] Yep, you're
exactly who I need.

435
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:54,541
[KAZAMA] The Funabori? She was
in my class this whole time?

436
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,541
According to this, she likes
all things domestic,

437
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,875
has a pleasant disposition

438
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,041
and is a genuinely
considerate person.

439
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,000
Oh my goodness, she even
gets to school early,

440
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,291
before everybody else,
and helps clean up.

441
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,791
[STUDENTS]
Whoa...!

442
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,666
Not to mention she waters
the flowers every day,

443
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,291
and sometimes even brings in
fresh plants. She's great! Wow!

444
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,958
And you say the floor
made this food "filthy"!

445
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,333
[KAZAMA grunts]

446
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:18,083
She's Amazing. I had no idea
Funabori was so handy.

447
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,416
Yeah, neither did I!

448
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,583
I'm so ashamed. I thought
the flowers were fake.

449
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,291
That girl is some
kind of angel.

450
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,958
[OHORI] Thank you
so much, Funabori!

451
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,541
--[GUY 5A] You rock!
--[GUY 5B] Yeah!

452
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,208
[GIRL 5B]
You're awesome!

453
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:33,958
[STUDENTS] Funabori! Funabori!
Funabori! Funabori!...

454
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,833
[KAZAMA] All right,
that's enough!

455
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,083
There, I hope
everyone's happy.

456
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,666
[FUNABORI]
Ah...

457
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,708
It's good, real good.

458
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,375
[CHITOSE] Uh, ya know it's
lunchtime, don't you, Kazama?

459
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,791
Do you have any
idea how much filth

460
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,583
everybody's tracked in
since this morning?

461
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:54,833
[KAZAMA heaves]

462
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,833
I've a confession.
I stepped in my puke.

463
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:57,875
[KAZAMA]
That's just gross!

464
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,000
And I peed on my shoe.

465
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,291
[KAZAMA]
Ugh. God!

466
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,875
Actually, so did I.

467
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,041
--[GIRL 5C] Me too!
--[GIRL 5D] Same here!

468
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,375
[GIRL 5E]
Guilty!

469
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,583
Is this a support group
for people that can't aim?

470
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,875
Wonderful, lunch is over!

471
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,166
[ROKA] Well, this's
been a pleasure,

472
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,875
but we've gotta
get back to class.

473
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,250
Have a great day!

474
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,041
Catch you on
the flip side, bro!

475
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:22,375
[KAZAMA] Damn it,
I'm starving here!

476
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,875
[FUNABORI]
'Scuse me...

477
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,166
[KAZAMA]
Huh?

478
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,000
[FUNABORI] I know it
isn't much, but take mine.

479
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,250
Hey! I'll share with you too!

480
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,416
Ditto! I'm so sorry
I ate your lunch, dude!

481
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,750
Yeah! Oops!

482
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:42,500
Now, then. Let's get
started, everyone. Huh?

483
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,708
[KONEKONE] Oh, dear.
I seem to have forgotten

484
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,875
some important worksheets
in the teacher's lounge.

485
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,875
I'm sorry. Study on
your own till I get back.

486
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,416
Wait a sec. Did he just
do that for Kazama?

487
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,791
Is he intentionally stalling?
So you can eat lunch?

488
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,833
[STUDENTS]
That guy is the bomb.

489
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,583
[TAKAO]
Kazama.

490
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,583
[KAZAMA]
Uh--?

491
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,750
You didn't get to eat
lunch today, did you?

492
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,291
[KAZAMA]
Eh?

493
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:17,916
[TAKAO]
Here.

494
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,625
Oh. What's that?

495
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:20,916
What on earth do
you mean, "what's that?"

496
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,750
it's a sandwich, genius.

497
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,291
But why?

498
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,875
Because... When I miss lunch
my stomach growls all day,

499
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,458
I figure you're the same.

500
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,291
There was one left in the
cafeteria, so I bought it.

501
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,208
[KAZAMA]
Thanks. I already ate.

502
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:38,000
I'll put it on your tab,
just take it. Please.

503
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:42,166
[KAZAMA] Mm... Well...
In that case, sure.

504
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,791
[KONEKONE]
Huh?

505
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:55,375
It would appear I've intruded.
Guess I'll be going, then.

506
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:03,583
To be young is an extraordinary
gift. So make the most of it.

507
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,916
[TAKAO &amp; KAZAMA]
He's awesome!

508
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,750
[JOE] Hey!
Hang in there! Come on!

509
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:48,416
With these wounds, he's a goner.

510
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,250
[alien sounds]

511
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:51,833
But isn't that...?

512
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:54,416
[alien sounds]

513
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,708
No, don't you
say another word!

514
00:23:56,791 --> 00:24:00,958
[alien sounds]

515
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:09,041
Damn you! Popilson!

516
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,333
[JOE] My name is Joe and I'm
an erotic magazine hunter.

517
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:18,833
It's my job to travel
across space and time,

518
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,250
delivering porn mags to
pervs across the Universe.

519
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:26,416
Unfortunately... nobody's gonna
wanna buy this piece of crap.
