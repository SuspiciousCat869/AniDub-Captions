Wait, I, I made the cut?

There's quite a few survivors.

will be mine nonetheless!

No, it'll be mine!

You mean mine!

It's gonna be me!

You're finally awake!

And not a moment too soon!

I've been so
worried about you!

Whoa, you're a lot
stronger than you look!

Thank goodness!

00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,458
You don't feel funny
anywhere, do you?

27
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,250
Well that dress is makin' me
feel a little bit funny.

28
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,333
It's weird.

29
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,083
I was tending to
the lump on your head,

30
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,625
and they just put me
on the first-aid team.

31
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:33,125
Inada said these nurse outfits
make us look more professional.

32
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,541
[KAZAMA] Uh--
You sure do cry a lot.

33
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,750
You okay?

34
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,125
Yeah. Super.

35
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:43,791
[KAZAMA] The wings're
a bit much, but whatever.

36
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,666
Wait, what'd you say
you were you tending to?

37
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,041
Well, you see...

38
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,166
Takao attacked you
with her boobies!

39
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,416
Wait, rewind!

40
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,541
More like, her tracksuit
launched its zipper

41
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,833
right at your forehead!

42
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,916
Uh! Now I remember!

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,541
It was a close-range
rack attack!

44
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,041
Try not to be mad at her.
It really was an accident,

45
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,541
believe me!

46
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,083
She helped us wrap your head!

47
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,291
That's how bad
she felt about it!

48
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,958
Well whadaya' know?

49
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:12,291
Huh. It seems like she
did a pretty good job.

50
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,916
Uh... I did the
actual wrapping.

51

You do it.

53

[FUNABORI]
But, she, um...

54
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,125
She totally stuck a cute
dolphin bandage on your head!

55
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:30,208
I can't tell if you're
offended on my behalf,

56
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,333
or wish you had done it.

57
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,958
Never mind!
It's not so cute!

58
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,458
Forget I said anything, okay?

59
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,583
C'mon.

Mm! Welcome!

[KAZAMA] Hmm...

Ahhh!
What's up with this guy?!

65
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,500
Let go of my hand already!

Would that I could, but we've
got business together!

68
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:58,041
You see, for the semifinal
round, you and Siou

69
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,791
are gonna face each other
in an old-school thumb-war.

70

Oh, a thumb-war, huh?

Wait! The semifinals?!

Now we meet on
the field of combat!

We're finally getting
our grand duel!

74
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,708
Right, we're only here
'cause you wanted a duel.

75
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,708
That's how this whole
tournament thing got started.

76
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,875
For the record, we've narrowed
down the field somewhat.

on the rankings.

[KAZAMA] Aw, what
the hell, you guys?!

80
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,166
So what did I do?
Snore my way to the top?

81
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,500
Kinda. We all agreed
that you deserved

82
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,791
to make the semifinals, whether
you were conscious or not.

83
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:32,708
[KAZAMA] Seriously?

84
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,583
[SIOU] Heh.

85
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,916
It wouldn't be very
sporting to kick him out.

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,375
What say you we let him hop
back into the competition

87
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,333
once he finally comes to?

88
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,375
Okay, I'm cool
with that.

89
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,666
Yeah, you're right.

90
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,041
It would be kind of
a shame to lose him.

91
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,791
I dig it.
He did protect Takao.

92
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,958
Fifty-Fifty was
getting all pervy.

93
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,375
Let's do him a solid.

94
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah, that zipper caught
him right in the melon.

95
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,416
I think that Kazama's gonna need
some time to sleep it off.

96
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,375
[OIMACHI]
No objections.

97
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,000
[ISLE] His disqualification

98
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,083
would lead to an unbalanced
playing field.

99
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:10,083
I require pitting myself against
Kazama in honest competition!

it to the semifinals?

seen some mileage today!

playin' over there?

the damn thing!

all neglected!

it like people're supposed to.

own match, wouldn't you agree?

off against in the finals?

161

Would you pick Takao or Roka?

[FUNABORI] Uh.

That's all.

It's obvious, isn't it?

Ah! Well,
who would it be?

So, then you really don't
care which one of them

Whichever one's stronger
is going to win.

173
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,416
And if I'm able to beat
whoever the winner is

then I'm totally
king of the hill.

wanted the final match

to be you and Roka.

even makes it that far.

which of us it is?

starting to tick me off!

[KAZAMA] Far as I'm concerned,
we've got a golden opportunity.

[ROKA] First, you say that
my bag doesn't matter to you.

00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,083
And now you say that you're
cool with fighting Takao,

187
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:49,583
even though you told me
you wanted it to be us!

explode upon impact

and she'll float away, yeah!

I guess that is how you usually
win at musical chairs.

[INADA] Well, yeah, if you
wanna get technical about it.

of a chump move, though.

but I presume that's what
the Fates have decreed.

round of the King's Game.

Here're the rules, people.

264
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,166
You take a bunch
of popsicle sticks,

265
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,083
number 'em according
to how many players,

266
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,166
and make one the King stick.

267
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,541
Pull the winning stick,
and you're the King.

268
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,250
Everyone else is a commoner.

269
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,541
And the King can boss around
the commoners however he wants!

270
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,083
But, seeing as how we
only have two players,

00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,708
we'll just skip the whole
bossing 'em around part.

wins the whole thing.

00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,791
Roka must have some
incredible luck!

320
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,958
Yeah. It's not lookin'
so good for Kazama!

321
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:25,541
[KAZAMA] Hmph. I dunno why
you guys are freaking out.

322
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,875
Think of it this way.

323
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,125
[ROKA] Hm?

324
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,583
Winnin' that angel was
pretty lucky, no doubt.

325
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,416
But doesn't that mean you're
all outta luck right now?

326
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,583
[CHITOSE]
He spun it like a pro!

327
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,375
Hold on.
Good luck can run out?

328
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,208
Sounds like a cliché
that would be used

329
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,083
by someone who's unlucky.

330
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,041
Your logic does not apply to me.

[SHINONOME, JIJOU and ISLE]
Roka's such a bad-ass!

332

Okay. I'm not denying
the girl is lucky.

333
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,375
Kinda reminds me...

334
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,333
...of something that happened
back at New Year's.

335
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:56,166
[INADA] He's pulling
a flashback?

336
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,208
[KAZAMA] I was thinkin' about
hittin' the local shrine,

337
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,291
so I was walkin' around
town with my little sister.

338
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,916
Just then!

[GROUP] Little Tama's New Year's
money from Grandpa?

342

Let the record show that there
was 10,000 yen in that envelope!

343

[INADA]
Wow, little Tama!

I get it.

346
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,625
You're saying that you were
pretty lucky to have found that

347
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:27,458
10,000 yen lying on the
sidewalk, is that it, Kazama?

348
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,625
No Roka!

349
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,166
That wasn't the
end of the story.

[ROKA gasps]

351
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,500
C'mon. Losing that much
money would be like

352
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,541
the end of the world
to a little kid, right?

353
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,750
Plus, I wanted to set a
good example for my sister.

354
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,500
So, I brought it to the cops.

355
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,583
Dammit, Kazama!

still a juvenile delinquent.

[KAZAMA] Did you know?

359
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,666
If an item sits in the
lost-and-found for half a year

360
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,583
without anyone coming to get it,

361
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:02,208
the guy who dropped it off
can claim it as his own?

362
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,375
That fateful day was
six long months ago.

363
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,750
And now!

I swear unto all of you!

I am not gonna go
back for that money!

[INADA] Did he just say

367
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,208
he's gonna pretend that he
never found the 10,000 yen?

368
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:20,166
And take all that luck back
into his system for this!

Huh, luck is a lot darker

than I thought it would be.

I forgot about the bag.

I'd keep it with me as proof
that I won the game, you know?

00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:58,333
Gentlemen.
When I look in this room,

475
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:01,125
I see a whole lotta
shiny scalps.

476
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,291
[OHORI] Whoa!
It's "I'm Not Bald" Tenjin!

477
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,000
Tenjin doesn't even
believe he's going bald!

478
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,625
Beat it!

479
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:11,250
[TENJIN] Hmph. I'm sick and
tired of lying to myself.

480
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:11,958
[OBORI groans]

481
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,291
[TENJIN] Starting now...

482
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:16,291
I'm Tenjin the Bald,
of the 24 Nocturnal Baldies!

483
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:18,416
Tenjin, that's so cool!

484
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,333
Now we're the 25
Nocturnal Baldies!

485
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:26,250
[OHORI and NAKASU] 
Tenjin? Tenjin!
