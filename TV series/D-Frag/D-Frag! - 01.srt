[students chatter]

2
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,500
[ROKA] Good morning.

3
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,416
Hi there! Would you...

4
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,541
[ROKA groans]

5
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,833
[KAZAMA] Hey, you all right?
Think you dropped this.

6
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,083
Best watch yourself, huh?

7
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:17,750
[ROKA] Thank y--

8
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:19,625
[YOKOSHIMA] Yo, Kenji!

9
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:20,916
Hey, how's it goin'?

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,166
[KAZAMA] Meh. Y'know.

11
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,166
[YOKOSHIMA] Whaddya say
we start the day right,

12
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,750
ditch first period?

13
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,916
[KAZAMA]
Heh, heh. Idiot.

14
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:37,041
[GUY 1A] People are
losing their minds.

15
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,666
[GUY 1B laughs]

16
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,625
Who're they
supposed to be?

17
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:43,791
Dude, I'm surprised you haven't
caught wind of these guys yet.

18
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:46,666
Say hello to Fujou Academy's
newest crop of thugs.

19
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,041
The Kazama Gang!

20
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,083
You got Little Foot Yokoshima.

21
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,500
[GUY 1B] Takes a lotta
nerve to sport stripes

22
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,041
with a gut like that.

23
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,375
[GUY 1A] Long Mountain Nagayama.

24
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:57,916
[GUY 1B] What does
that even mean?

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,833
[GUY 1A] And their
ringleader, uh, um...

26
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:03,541
Hang on, it'll come
to me... Damn it.

27
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,916
It's part of the gang's name!

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,291
If you're givin' us
a runnin' commentary,

29
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,500
have your ducks in a row!

30
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,958
[GUY 1B] Run for your life!

31
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,750
Sorry, man. Our bad.

32
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,083
We just kinda
naturally stand out.

33
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,875
[KAZAMA]
Oh, yeah? Ya think?

34
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,708
Way to be here two minutes and
already get slapped with a rep.

35
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,875
Why people gotta go stereotypin'
juvenile delinquents like that?

36
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,458
[KAZAMA sighs]

37
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,708
Maybe we could soften our image
by joinin' one of those clubs.

38
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,708
Everyone seems to
like that sorta thing.

39
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:33,875
It's too late to set a course

40
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,291
for the straight
and narrow now, boys...

41
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:39,875
'cause I plan on using these
fists to conquer the school!

42
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,166
[GIRL 1A] I think I finally
learned how to play a "fa."

43
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,708
[GIRL 1C] Remi!

44
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,750
[CHITOSE] Still no new
candidates for membership.

45
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,083
If things keep going like this,
we're destined to lose the club.

46
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,916
Why does the school care
if we stay like we are?

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,500
We're big enough!

48
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,291
They care simply because we
call ourselves a culture club

49
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,708
without having produced
a shred of culture.

50
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,166
Ugh. What do they want
from us? We play games!

51
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,916
Apparently that's not enough.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,750
They're saying that if we stick
with the Game Creation handle,

53
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,125
we'll actually have
to create games.

54
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,416
Oh, yeah.

55
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,208
That really just
dawned on you?

56
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,083
Until today, I've been
able to navigate us

57
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,708
around that little
technicality, but...

58
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:26,833
The fact is we're short

59
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,958
the minimum number
of members required.

60
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,250
I'm really going to miss sitting
around doing jack squat.

61
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,625
So when's the
recruitment deadline?

62
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,375
--[CHITOSE] Today.
--[SAKURA groans]

63
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,750
[YOKOSHIMA] Hahaha!
Here's the deal, fellas.

64
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,083
If the Kazama Gang's gonna let
the li'l sheeple around here

65
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,458
know who's boss,
we gots to strut our stuff!

66
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,375
Couple a' hostile takeovers,
maybe a turf war.

67
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,750
I suppose we could
always make a play

68
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,416
for the Golf Bag
Gang's territory.

69
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,291
The Golf Bag Gang?
That can't be their real name.

70
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,583
[YOKOSHIMA] Or... We could
run a protection racket

71
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,250
on the culture clubs! Dude!
Think of the graft!

72
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,250
It'd be awesome!

73
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,625
Nice.

74
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,750
I mean, c'mon, what
self-respecting evil overlords

75
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,166
buy their own manga,
am I right?

76
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,166
Weren't you guys bitchin' about
stereotypes two minutes ago?

77
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,250
[YOKOSHIMA]
You said it yourself--

78
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,250
we've gotta conquer the school!

79
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,541
[NAGAYAMA &amp; YOKOSHIMA yell]

80
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,833
Fire in the hole!

00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,541
Everybody stop drop an'--

82
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,750
[ROKA gasps]

83
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,291
The hell's going on here?

84
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,583
Uh... This fire is nothing
but an illusion, good sir.

85
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,916
Yeah, well, your "illusion's"
gonna burn this place down!

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,083
[NAGAYAMA] Kenji!
Fire Extinguisher!

87
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,458
Right, yes!

88
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,500
Ladies, please step aside!

89
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:41,041
Yeah! 'Cause that's
what's up, fire!

90
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,916
[ALL] Hooray!
The day is saved!

91
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,083
[KAZAMA] Whoa.
What am I doing?

92
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,666
Why do I give a crap
one way or the other?

93
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,625
You handled that
illusion admirably.

94
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,333
[KAZAMA] Were you
trying to kill us all?

95
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,375
How'd you manage to get the
damn thing started anyway?

96
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,166
[KAZAMA] Fireworks?

97
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,500
[YOKOSHIMA trembles]

98
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,708
You'll never know how much
we appreciate the help.

99
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:16,375
Yokoshima! What did you
do to him? Nagaya--!

100
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,958
Nagayama!!

101
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,541
What is wrong
with you people?

102
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,250
I'm channeling a
lightning elemental.

103
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,250
And I'm channeling
a water one!

104
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,250
[KAZAMA]
Okay, I'm lost.

105
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,291
Word of our powers must not
leak to the outside world.

106
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,541
So we're erasing your memories
of what just happened.

107
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,750
You girls are nuts!

108
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,291
[ROKA]
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,208
You've stolen a forbidden
glance into my fire magic.

110
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,041
I'm compelled to
make you forget.

111
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,291
I've done what now?

112
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,041
Are you tryin' to
say you're magical?

113
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,708
[ROKA] Each of us here is an
elemental magic wielder, yes.

114
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,500
[KAZAMA] You're all out
of your freakin' minds!

115
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,083
Let go of me, I'm serious!

116
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,208
Invoke Water Lock!

117
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,458
Invoke Lightning Lock!

118
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,583
Ugh! That's not
even a real thing!

119
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,750
[ROKA] I'm afraid
you've seen too much.

120
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,208
Y-You're totally gonna
burn me alive, aren't you?

121
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,916
Somebody help!

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,625
I hereby wipe your mind clean.
And, uh, if you....

123
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,500
If you don't forget,
I won't like you!

124
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,750
[KAZAMA]
Come again?

125
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,250
No! You've brought
her ultimate flame-based

126
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,708
Moe-Moe Attack
trembling to its knees!

127
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:22,958
[MINAMI] It's okay,
I don't think her wounds

128
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,541
are beyond healing!

129
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:28,291
[KAZAMA] Alrighty, then. Maybe
her and fire really are a thing.

130
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,916
[KAZAMA]
Hm? Uh--?

131
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,166
Earth elemental.

132
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,541
Huh?

133
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,750
Dirt Punch, bitch!

134
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,291
Okay, first of all, that was
a cheap shot; second of all,

135
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,375
earth elemental magic
is supposed to be neutral!

136
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,083
Ooh, neutral magic, eh?
He's catching on pretty fast.

137
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,166
Uh-huh. Not just anybody
would blurt that out.

138
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,083
I'm sorry I was late.
I was building a sandcastle.

139
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,000
[KAZAMA]
How old are you?

140
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,125
Which explains why my
hands are covered with dirt.

141
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,750
Hence, earth elemental.

142
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,333
Well, that clears that up!

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,791
I've got to make
a run for it.

144
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,458
[YOKOSHIMA] Yo, Kenji!
Wanna drumstick?

145
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,041
[NAGAYAMA] Check me
while I sink this shot!

146
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,333
[KAZAMA] 'Cept I can't
just leave 'em here

147
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,625
with these crazies.

148
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,375
If you're trying to
banish the guy's memory,

149
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,666
I don't think it's working.

150
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,791
Yeah, no kidding.

151
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,458
I know. We'll launch an attack

152
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:21,916
comprised of all our
elements working in tandem!

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,833
[KAZAMA] This is
not gonna end well.

154
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:28,666
[NAGAYAMA &amp; YOKOSHIMA]
We'll always be best friends!

155
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,416
I'll come back for you!

156
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,541
[CHITOSE] What kind of man
leaves his friends to die?

157
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,791
[KAZAMA] Least in this scenario
one of us survives!

158
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,375
Why do I feel the need to
plead my case with the enemy?

159
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,041
Turn around and
face your fate!

160
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,791
Uh, that might've
been a little harsh.

161
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,916
[KAZAMA] Aahhh!
They're gonna kill me!

162
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,916
[CHITOSE] It was
a figure of speech!

163
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,625
Figure of speech, my butt!
You're homicidal!

164
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:59,291
[KAZAMA yells, pants]

165
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:03,041
Nooo!

166
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,708
[KAZAMA pants]

167
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,375
You're good. Calm down,
you managed to shake 'em.

168
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:14,041
What kinda club're they runnin',
anyway? They're all insane.

169
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,500
Excuse me.

170
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,791
Fire magic girl!

171
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,833
I never said thank you.

172
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,291
Thank you?

173
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,666
For coming to our rescue.

174
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,625
Uh... What now?

175
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:27,875
We've learned our lesson.

176
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,916
No more fireworks
in the clubroom.

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,208
Well, good for you!

178
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,625
What were they doing there
in the first place?

179
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,083
We need new members
and I thought

180
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,458
a pyrotechnic display
would be good marketing.

181
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,041
You could've burned the
whole school to the ground!

182
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,916
That's true. Why didn't
I think of that?

183
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,875
[KAZAMA]
That's not what I meant!

184
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,875
Oh, and thanks
for this morning.

185
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,000
You picked up those
flyers for me.

186
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,666
It was a nice thing to do.

187
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,166
Uh... Wait.

188
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,708
So... You're the girl I saw
at the gate this morning?

189
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,208
You don't remember?

190
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,083
You were passing out flyers
for that schizophrenic club?

191
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,458
Schizophrenic?

192
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,083
Look, just...
Just leave me alone

193
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,500
and we'll call it even, alright?

194
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:07,041
I'm glad I could give you
a hand. Have a nice life.

195
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,791
[ROKA] For the record,
my club could really use

196
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,250
somebody like you.

197
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,750
The club's yours?

198
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:15,458
Roka Shibasaki, at your service.
Game Club President.

199
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,916
I thought it was called
the Game Creation Club.

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,125
[ROKA] Whatever.
I'm recruiting you.

201
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,041
Thanks, but that's
not my scene.

202
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,875
[ROKA] It's not just about
gaming. It's about making games.

203
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,541
What're you doing?
You know your ultimate

204
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,416
fire-based whatever attack
isn't gonna work on me.

205
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,000
[ROKA] My fire magic
is mere camouflage.

206
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,333
[KAZAMA]
Huh?

207
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:43,708
Beneath this veneer.
I am a wielder of darkness.

208
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,416
Uh, okay.

209
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,208
[KAZAMA screams]

210
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,000
[YOKOSHIMA] What the...?

211
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,541
[NAGAYAMA]
Did I miss somethin'?

212
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,583
[YOKOSHIMA]
Where did Kenji go?

213
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,041
[KAZAMA]
I'm in the dark!

214
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,208
[KAZAMA screams]

215
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,250
Help me! I can't see!
Where am I?

216
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,208
As of this moment, two paths
are open before you.

217
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,958
On the one hand, you do
the respectable thing

218
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,500
and join the Game Creation Club.
And on the other...

219
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,375
[ROKA] Choose wisely,
hapless traveler.

220
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,416
[KAZAMA]
Okay! Fine, I'll join!

221
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,416
Just take this thing
off a' me! Please!

222
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,458
Now that's what
I like to hear.

223
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,333
Starting over. My name
is Roka Shibasaki.

224
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,541
Game Creation Club President.

225
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:43,041
Second-year Chitose
Karasuyama. What's up?

226
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,166
First-year Sakura Mizukami.

227
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,750
[KAZAMA] I don't care what your
names are, take this thing off!!

228
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,083
[CHITOSE] I'm gonna need
you to pay attention, noob.

229
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,166
[KAZAMA]
What're you doing?

230
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,291
[CHITOSE] Huh.
He seems to be caressing

231
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,250
the sole of my shoe
with his face.

232
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,583
Do you have a foot fetish?

233
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:59,458
[KAZAMA] No, I don't!
That's gross. Cut it out!

234
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,583
What's wrong with you?

235
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:01,833
Sorry about the ropes.

236
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,250
We didn't think you'd
hear us out otherwise.

237
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,500
You ever stop and
think maybe you're

238
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,041
takin' things a little too far?

239
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,583
All right then, Mr. Foot Fetish,
you've heard our names.

240
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,208
No! Knock it off!
You're tryin' to make me out

241
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,875
to be some kind of perv mage!

242
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,083
I was only pointing out
we don't know who you are.

243
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,166
Forget it.
Doesn't matter.

244
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,583
Wait, what?

245
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,458
Just hurry up and fill out
this club enrollment form.

246
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,708
[KAZAMA] If they hand
that thing to a teacher,

247
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,375
I am royally screwed.

248
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,625
[SAKURA giggles]

249
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:25,875
[KAZAMA] But if I
refuse to fill it out,

250
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,791
there's no telling what
they'll do to me. Damn.

251
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:35,958
Well, what do you know?

252
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,916
He doesn't throw a fit
about everything.

253
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,208
Glad you could see your way
clear to accepting our terms.

254
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,375
Whatever.

255
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,375
Well if that's it, I think
I'll head home now.

256
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,916
Sure. Knock yourself out.
Everything seems to be legit.

257
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,708
[KAZAMA] Sweet!
Phase one successful.

258
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,375
Now for phase two: cutting the
delivery girl off at the pass

259
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,000
as she's on her
way to the office,

260
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,583
ramping up the ol' charm,

261
00:11:56,666 --> 00:12:00,625
and getting a hold of the form
before a teacher does. Simple.

262
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,208
Okay. Let's make
this official.

263
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,208
[KAZAMA]
Huh?

264
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,583
Right. You girls
have enough now.

265
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,250
[KAZAMA] Oh, son of a...!
There's no way in hell

266
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,000
you're a teacher!
Gimme a break!

267
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:12,833
Oh. Miss Ohsawa--
club faculty advisor.

268
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,500
Nice to meet you.

269
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:19,791
[KAZAMA yells]

270
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,875
Déjà vu.

271
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,458
[CHITOSE] You squirrelly
little bastard!

272
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,541
Keep the rampage on dull.

273
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,750
[KAZAMA] Plan B,
I run for my life. Again.

274
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,208
What kind of teacher lets
them get away with--?

275
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,791
Gah, you're fast!

276
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,666
Heh. You got the drop on me last
time because I wasn't prepared.

277
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,208
But no one escapes me twice!

278
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,083
See, this round I was crouched
in a starting position

279
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,250
from the moment
you turned to leave.

280
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,666
[KAZAMA] I can't tell if this
girl's a moron or a genius.

281
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,375
'Member me? I'm Sakura Mizukami
from Class 1-D; the water type!

282
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,958
[KAZAMA] Who cares?

283
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:53,083
Hand over the enrollment form
now or I'll show you no mercy!

284
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,500
Somethin' wrong?

285
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,791
Dang it, I forgot
my water bottle!

286
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:56,916
[KAZAMA]
Huh?

287
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,041
Give me a second,
I'll be right back.

288
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,541
Promise not to go anywhere!

289
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,583
[KAZAMA] She really can't
do anything without water?

290
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,958
Girl's committed,
I'll give 'er that.

291
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,125
Heh. Shoulda known I
couldn't give you the slip.

292
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,625
If you hand over the
enrollment form this instant,

293
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:20,041
I shall do you a
kindness. I, uh...

294
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:23,000
I'll sing your praises to
every corner of Fujou Academy.

295
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,625
Sorry, sweetheart.
Moe doesn't do it for me.

296
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,500
[ROKA gasps]

297
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:31,500
[ROKA grunts]

298
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,083
Vicious verbal
onslaught dodged!

299
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,958
[KAZAMA]
Now she's pissed!

300
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,833
Oh, come on! Enough with
the Darker than Black shtick!

301
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,375
It's really starting
to get on my nerves!

302
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,458
[ROKA] Tremble in
primordial darkness!

303
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,750
Feel the grip of deepest night
tighten around your throat!

304
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,500
Ugh. I'm blind as a flippin'
bat. If I don't get outta here,

305
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,541
the dirt freak's gonna
show up and clean my clock.

306
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,750
[ROKA] Chitose won't
be here for a while.

307
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,708
She's recharging at the sandbox.

308
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,291
[KAZAMA] It's scary how
serious they take this stuff.

309
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,291
Wait.
That gives me an idea.

310
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,708
It's just you an'
me then, isn't it?

311
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,083
One magic user alone
can't keep me in check.

312
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,208
We've already
established that! Hahahaha!

313
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:15,166
[KAZAMA] Um...
Maybe I was a bit too cocky.

314
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,708
[KAZAMA screams]

315
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:25,000
Nice save! 'Kay, pull me up--
or don't, actually! Hold up!

316
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,750
[KAZAMA] This is not
how I want to end my day.

317
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,583
'Kay, so here's a thought.
It's not that far down.

319
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,833
[ROKA] Forget it!

320
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:37,750
I'm not letting go! I've finally
found a prospective new member;

321
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,541

happens every day?

322
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,708
You can't slip
through my fingers!

323
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,125
Stop bein' crazy,
you're gonna fall!

324
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,541
I accept my fate!

325
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,333
Look, you really need to stop
with the whole Moe act!

326
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:50,000
Shut up! It's not
an act! It's me!

327
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,833
But you...

328
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,583
And you're totally slipping
through my fingers.

329
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,666
Wait, what happened
to not letting me go?

330
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,666
This position is
putting a lot of pressure

331
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,750
on my tummy, alright? Not that
you care, but it's my dream

332
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,833
to hear the pitter patter
of little feet someday.

333
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,833
I can see it now: two girls
and a boy in footie pajamas,

334
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,375
banging the trays
of their highchairs

335
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,750
while momma cracks open
a jar of strained carrots.

336
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:15,375
Okay, I'm done. Just let me
fall, please! Whenever is good.

337
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,333
Nicely done, madam president.

338
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,916
[KAZAMA]
'Bout time.

339
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,083
I thought I was
a goner for sure.

340
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,958
Let's get out of here.

341
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,333
Kenji Kazama
from Class 2-B.

342
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,708
Welcome to the Game
Creation Club, Kenji.

343
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,375
[KAZAMA]
Thank you.

344
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,083
So I kinda let myself get
caught up in the moment

345
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:04,750
and joined their club.
I know: what's wrong with me?

346
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,916
Which club again?

347
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,333
Were we there?

348
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,541
[KAZAMA] Oh, come on!
Seriously? This is ridiculous!

349
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,416
Anyway, boss,
check out my 'do!

350
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,875
No idea where it came from,
but I think we got a keeper!

351
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,458
Oh, yeah!
That's awesome!

352
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,875
[YOKOSHIMA] I know, right? If I
had like a pair of nunchuks...

353
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,250
[KAZAMA] Guess
it's for the best.

354
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,958
No point draggin'
my boys into this.

355
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,750
[ATARU]
Kenji!

00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,208
Are you hurt?
Where did they get you?

357
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,916
You gotta talk to me, Kenji!
Where does it hurt the worst?

358
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,333
I'm not seeing any obvious
contusions or lacerations,

359
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,708
thank heavens, but still...

360
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,083
We're not out of
the woods just yet.

361
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,791
Let's get those clothes
off and have a look!

362
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,875
[KAZAMA] Ataru!
Am I supposed to have

363
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,583
the first clue what
you're talkin' about?

364
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,750
'Cause if you don't stop
gabbing, I swear on my life...

365
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,375
Well, well, what brings
the Vice Prez here?

366
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,958
[ATARU groans]

367
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,208
Stop it, you know I despise it
when my friends call me that.

368
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,791
Call me Acchan. You know, like
you used to back in the day.

369
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,041
It's not like
we've been besties

370
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,833
since elementary
school or anything!

371

[YOUNG ATARU]
C'mon, guys! Follow me!

372
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,458
[YOUNG KAZAMA]
Wait up!

373
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,375
We were inseparable;
but for some reason

374
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,166
best known to yourselves
you fell into a life

375
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,958
of thuggishness
and petty crime.

376
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,916
Why did you turn
your backs on me?

377
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,916
[KAZAMA] Will you just tell
us what you're doing here?

378
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,916
Ah. Yes, of course.

379
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,708
Kenji. Word through the
grapevine is... is, well,

380
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,000
that you might have joined the
so-called Game Creation Club.

381
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,125
Yeah, and what if I have?

382
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,000
It's a dangerous place.

383
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,875
I'm not speaking of the
club itself necessarily.

384
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:29,000
But Chitose Karasuyama
cannot be trusted.

385
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,291
Come on! She's a
dirt freak; so what?

386
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,791
Are you out of your mind?

387
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,583
She happens to be Fujou's
Student Body President!

388
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,083
What the--? You gotta
be kidding me!!

389
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,958
[ATARU]
I don't kid, my friend.

390
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:44,125
Chitose is the Academy's
15th Student Body President.

391
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,708
And between her shrewd
political maneuvering

392
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,125
and her animal magnetism,
she's got the whole school--

393
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:51,000
even the faculty--
eating right out of her hand.

394
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,916
She's so powerful,
so implacable,

the Heavenly Kings,
the Two Brothers,

396

and the Band of Fourteen
Devils all went into hiding!

397
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,708
Wait, you're tellin' me
this place already had

398
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,333
that many gangs
before we got here?

399
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,500
Oh, please! As far as everyone
else in school is concerned,

you lot might as well
have just fallen

off the back of a turnip truck!

Ouch.

Back to Miss Karasuyama.

404
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:14,041
My being Vice President makes
she and I eternal arch nemeses.

Condemned to fight
to the bitter end!

Crap! She heard us!

00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,041
Didn't anyone ever teach you

that it's bad manners
to eavesdrop?

412
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,583
I was standing near a
window; it's not my fault

happened to be near a window.

some voyeurs.

Please don't say stuff
like that, Madam President!

Don't say "please"

saying she's won!

Nice try, Madam President,
but you're on the second floor!

424

00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,625
I thought it best to concede
victory to my opponent.

441
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,666
I wanted to contribute
without being hampered

00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,500
Oh, crap! Screw this!
It just got real!

461
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,166
[KAZAMA] Don't just stand there,
you idiot! Run away!

462
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,625
To hell with that!
I'm standing my ground!

463
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:25,958
Dude, if that thing hits you,

464
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,750
it's not gonna be anything
like a boot to the neck!

465
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,458
I don't care! Running away
from this now means I'll be

466
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,041
a sole-licking sycophant for
the rest of my natural life!

467
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:36,500
I'm not giving in!
Today, everything changes!

468
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:40,041
I'm gonna save the
reputation of my friends!

469
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:43,291
Ataru...
What in the hell?

470
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,166
Besties for life.
Count us in.

471
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,083
Aw, you guys...

472
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:54,000
[ATARU] Hear that,
Madam President? Bring it on!

473
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,125
[KAZAMA]
Uh...

474
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,750
I will surpass
your earth magic!

475
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:01,041
Never let it be said I don't
admire your moxy, VP, now die!

476
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:05,875
[ATARU and CHITOSE struggle]

477
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,250
[ATARU] Kenji!
A little help, please?

478
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,208
[KAZAMA] I'm sorry,
you need me for something?

479
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,416
Damn it, man! We can't
do this without you!

480
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,166
How am I supposed
to turn my life around

481
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,208
with you playing
tic-tac-toe?

482
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,250
[KAZAMA] Well you sure didn't
need me to get this far.

483
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,916
You, uh... you
got two minutes.

484
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,458
That's as long as
I can keep this up.

485
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,250
[KAZAMA]
Nagayama!

486
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,416
Yeah, better make it one.

487
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
[KAZAMA]
Seriously?

488
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,500
Huh. That's not a
whole lot of time.

489
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,791
But if I start now,
that one minute...

490
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:32,458
[KAZAMA growls]

491
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,666
[KAZAMA]
Hyah!

492
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,833
[ATARU]
Go!

493
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:35,500
[KAZAMA]
Hyah!

494
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:36,625
[CHITOSE gasps]

495
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:37,791
[KAZAMA]
...should be enough!

496
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,500
[ATARU &amp; KAZAMA grunt]

497
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,833
I set out to try
and save my friends.

498
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,250
But when it was all said
and done, you saved me.

499
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,833
Forget about it.

500
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,458
I was itchin' for some payback
anyway, so it all worked out.

501
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,333
[CHITOSE]
Bravo.

502
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:01,333
I didn't approve of Roka
enlisting you at first.

503
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:05,791
But I suppose...
opinions can change.

504
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,375
Even if I have
won this round.

505
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,333
[KAZAMA &amp; ATARU]
Uh... Uhhh...

506
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:13,041
[YOKOSHIMA]
Run away!

507
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,541
[KAZAMA]
Ehhh...

508
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,500
[ROKA]
Hey, Kenji!

509
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:23,958
Oh, it's you.

510
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,333
FYI, we meet up
four times a week.

511
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:29,166
Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday.

512
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:33,166
Whatever. Look... How come
you wanted me to join?

513
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,000
Why, do you think
the club is dumb?

514
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,875
Are you backing out?

515
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:52,291
I already submitted the
enrollment form, so...

516
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:55,041
Guess I'm here to stay.

517
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,750
[ROKA] Awesome!
