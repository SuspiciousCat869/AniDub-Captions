[yawns]

2
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:26,791
Uh?

3
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,083
[gasps]

4
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,375
[SENKO]
It snowed!

5
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,708
[sighs]

6
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,500
It's really piled up out there!

7
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,666
And if I recall correctly, it's
quite unusual for this region

8
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,625
to accumulate so much snow.

9
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,083
[NAKANO] Yep, it's the most
we've had in decades.

10
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,333
Indeed!

11
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,958
Though, I can't help
but notice...

12
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,291
...that you seem to be putting
on your office attire!

13
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,375
Yes well, that's what
I do every morning.

14
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,208
And if I don't hurry up
and get on the road,

15
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,291
then I'll be late for work.

16
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,000
[SENKO]
You can't!

17
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:01,666
There's simply no way you can go
to the office in all that snow!

18
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,625
I definitely agree
with you there.

19
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,000
[SENKO]
Then stay!

20
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,250
[sighs] Unfortunately my
company sees it differently,

21
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:11,000
and they haven't sent anything
out saying we're closed, so...

22
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,541
Are you serious?!

23
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,041
Wait, how do you even know
if the trains are running?

24
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,041
They are, but they
might stop soon.

25
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,125
So I need to leave early.

26
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,083
[SENKO grumbles]

27
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,000
[door opens]

28
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,708
[NAKANO]
See you later.

29
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,750
If the trains stop running,
then how will you get home?

30
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,833
Well, I dunno, I'll just
stay at the office.

31
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,625
Come on now, Senko, if you're
going to be out in public,

32
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,750
then you need at least to
put on your hat and coat.

33
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,083
I'm not letting go!

34
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:51,500
Besides, nobody else going be
outside in this kind of weather!

35
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,666
[NAKANO]
Yeah, I guess.

36
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,250
[SENKO] Look, I really
think you should take

37
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,333
a little more time
to relax or play!

38
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,166
Well, I really think you need
to go back into the apartment.

39
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,500
[phone vibrates]

40
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,500
[NAKANO]
Of course.

41
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,250
We just got an e-mail saying
the office is closed.

42
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,750
Oh good, that's wonderful news!

43
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,083
Still though, it's a little bit
frustrating that your work

44
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,083
waited so long before
letting everyone know

45
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,375
that they were
closed for the day.

46
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:24,500
I know. At least it's
settled, though.

47
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,625
Man I had no idea it was
going to snow this much.

48
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,083
Well then, wanna
go back inside?

49
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,000
Nuh-uh! Here.

50
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,041
I say that we play
outside for a while

51
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,125
[NAKANO]
Hey, wait!

52
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,833
It's deep!

53
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,625
[SENKO laughs]

54
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,750
Let's go back inside. There's
no reason to be out here.

55
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,750
Yep, this snow is
definitely high-quality!

56
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,583
Uhh...

57
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,958
Oh.

58
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,500
[NAKANO]
It is really pretty.

59
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,708
Now that I think about it,

60
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:02,500
it's been a while since
I've seen this much.

61
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,708
[SENKO]
Oh? [laughs]

62
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:06,875
Well, if that's the case,

63
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,416
I think we should
have a little fun!

64
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,791
Uh, I'll pass,
I think I'm a little old

65
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,250
for that sort of thing.

66
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,791
But it's important to get up
and move around sometimes.

67
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,375
[NAKANO] I don't know,
maybe that should be

68
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,208
reserved for warmer weather.

69
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:22,875
[SENKO grumbles]
My, you're such a wet blanket.

70
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,916
I'm sorry, Senko.

71
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,333
Hurry up, slow poke.

72
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,416
[SENKO humming]

73
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,291
[NAKANO]
The snow might be pretty,

74
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,958
but it pales in comparison

75
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,916
to her tail swishing
in a world of white.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,416
The snow outlines
her ears beautifully.

77
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:10,291
[NAKANO] This winter wonderland
serves as the perfect frame

78
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,291
for her gorgeous golden fur.

79
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,208
[exhales]

80
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,041
[NAKANO] I'm a bit worried
that she's not hiding

81
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,916
her ears and tail,

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,958
but since no one's around,
I guess it's okay this once.

83
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,375
--[SENKO laughs]
--[NAKANO gasps]

84
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,708
Why are you so quiet?

85
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,041
Have you finally given up
on going back inside?

86
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,166
No, that's not it.

87
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,666
I was just thinking about
how pretty you look.

88
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,958
Guess I got lost in my thoughts.

89
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,208
[SENKO]
Strange, I suddenly feel

90
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,875
the need to burn
off some energy.

91
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,000
Man, you must really
wanna play in the snow.

92
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,458
[SENKO groans]

93
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,375
Hm?

94
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,625
[NAKANO]
To be honest though,

95
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,666
I'd be lying if I said I
didn't want to play in it.

96
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,500
But I'm too old for
stuff like that.

97
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:02,875
[NAKANO grunts]

98
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,375
Uh. Hey! Senko!

99
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,000
[SENKO] Let me guess,
you were thinking about playing

100
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,041
but you're worried
about your age.

101
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,208
But take a look at me,
I'm over 800 old,

102
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,791
and I'm about to start a ruckus.

103
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,458
Now, then, stop worrying
about your age so much

104
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,791
and come enjoy
this snow with me!

105
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,500
[NAKANO]
Mm.

106
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,625
Well. If you insist then.

107
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:30,041
All right, prepare
for war, Senko!

108
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,916
You asked for it!

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,500
Ah!

110
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:37,958
Oh no, I've been hit! [laughs]

111
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,750
Having fun yet?

112
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,958
I must say, you look
rather relaxed, dear.

113
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,750
I am.

114
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,666
You should give it a try,
believe it or not--

115
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,750
the cold snow actually
feels pretty good.

116
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:58,625
[SENKO]
Is that so?

117
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,500
Well, in that case...

118
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,541
Here goes!

119
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,791
[SENKO grunts]

120
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:10,166
[laughs] Excellent dive, Senko.

121
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,041
Very fox-like of you.

122
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,000
Maybe because I am a fox!

123
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,375
Yeah, that's true!

124
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,250
[laughing]

125
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,375
[SENKO]
Come on, it's not that funny.

126
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,875
Are you sure?

127
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,875
I've never seen anyone dive
into snow head-first before.

128
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,166
That's just silly.

129
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,458
No, silly was seeing your
face in a snow mound

130
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,375
and your tail in the air.

131
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,500
That's not silly!

132
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,500
It is, too! [laughs]

133
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,500
To be honest, that's
actually the first time

134
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,333
I've done it in
hundreds of years.

135
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:40,958
[BOTH laughing]

136
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,625
Empty as usual.

137
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,541
Off to the store, then.

138
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,458
Whoa, seriously?

139
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,041
That is an unholy
amount of snow.

140
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,375
But on the bright side, I could
build a snowman if I wanted to.

141
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,458
Uh?

142
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,250
[NAKANO] Hold up!
Don't you think that's too big?!

143
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,500
Please be careful with
that ball of death, Senko!

144
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,083
[KOENJI] It's hard to believe
that a mere human could

145
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,625
make a snowball that large.

146
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:35,791
No way, it can't be!

147
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:39,541
Senko must be from
a snowy region!

148
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,000
Aw man, it's cold out here!

149
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,125
[NAKANO sighs] We played
outside for quite a while!

150
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:49,125
Yes, it's nice to let your
inner child out, isn't it?

151
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,666
Sure, every now and then.

152
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,166
All right, I think I'm gonna
try and do some work from home.

153
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,916
[SENKO gasps]

154
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,708
[NAKANO]
Uh. What's wrong?

155
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:00,625
Did you hurt your back?

156
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,750
[SENKO]
No. It's perfectly fine.

157
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,333
How's your back?

158
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,916
[NAKANO] Good. Maybe you should
take it easy tonight, though.

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,250
Maybe.

160
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,916
You must be cold
from our adventure;

161
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,791
shall I heat up the bath water?

162
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,375
Yeah, that'd be awesome!

163
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,416
My hands are so cold
right now, they're numb.

164
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,666
'Kay!

165
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,875
Uh. Wait, Senko?

166
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,375
Is something wrong?

167
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,083
Listen. This may
sound kind of weird,

168
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,375
but I have a favor
to ask of you.

169
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,791
Go on.

170
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,791
[NAKANO] Would it be all right
if I warmed my hands up

171
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:39,708
in your tail?

172
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,291
[gasps]

173
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,541
I suppose, but just for today.

174
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,875
[NAKANO]
Seriously?

175
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,000
My, you're incorrigible.

176
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:55,125
I really appreciate
your indulging me, Senko.

177
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,750
[yelps]

178
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,916
[NAKANO] Feeling my cold
fingers gently warmed

179
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,666
in the embrace
of majestic floof.

180
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,916
This is what heaven feels like!

181
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,125
[gasping]

182
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,583
[SENKO sneezes]

183
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,583
I'm sorry, I never meant
to make you sick.

184
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,666
Are you feeling any better now?

185
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,916
[SENKO slurps]
I'm afraid there'll be a ban

186
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,375
on fluffing for a while.

187
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,541
--[NAKANO] What?!
--[SENKO] A ban!

188
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,666
[NAKANO]
Fair...

189
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,916
[CHILDREN chattering]

190
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,208
[NAKANO]
Mm?

191
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,208
[NAKANO] Senko has somehow
turned into a <i>kotatsu.</i>

192
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,083
She also said there was
a ban on tail fluffing.

193
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,916
If I touch it now,
I'm sure she'll be livid.

194
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Uh.

195
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,875
[NAKANO]
What is this?

196
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,333
Is she giving me
the green light to fluff?

197
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,958
To fluff a <i>kotatsu</i> -heated
tail would be pure bliss.

198
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,041
[NAKANO]
It's so warm and soft!

199
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,583
Eep!

200
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,875
[NAKANO]
<i>Kotatsu</i> plus fluff.

201
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,500
It's the ultimate combination!

202
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,166
I don't want this to end!

203
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,666
Well, have you
had your fill, yet?

204
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,541
No, I want more.

205
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:56,958
But if you don't let me up soon,

206
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,375
I'm not going to be able
to start on dinner.

207
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,583
[NAKANO]
Just a little longer?

208
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:04,208
That's enough, I've only
just lifted the ban.

209
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:07,333
Besides, maybe I'll let you
fluff it again, later.

210
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,625
Uhh.

211
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,708
[SORA] Why don't you let the
young sir do as he pleases?

212
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,750
Yeah, that's right!
You should listen to--

213
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:19,333
Uh, wait. Who's that talking?

214
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,666
Eep!

215
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,000
You scoundrel.

216
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,875
Ah! Holy crap, I am so sorry!

217
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:31,166
It was a mere accident.
It's all right.

218
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,916
[NAKANO] Wait. Haven't
I seen her somewhere?

219
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,458
[SENKO]
Lady Sora?

220
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,666
Why is it that you've come here?

221
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,250
[SORA]
Why, indeed?

222
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,583
A fair question.

223
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,083
I suppose I wanted to toy with--

224
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:47,000
Oops. Uh, to come and meet you.

225
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,458
[NAKANO] I'm pretty sure
she actually meant "toy."

226
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,958
Uh?

227
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,125
Heh.

228
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,541
[gasps] Hold on.

229
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,125
Stop me if I'm wrong,
but weren't you the lady I met

230
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,416
in the snack shop at the beach?

231
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,250
Oh, good! So, you
remember me, do you?

232
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,208
How flattering.

233
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,583
I knew it!

234
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,000
I wanted to thank you for
the wonderful gifts.

235
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:12,291
Yes, thank you. They were
exceptionally delicious.

236
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,125
We really appreciated it.

237
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,208
Ah.

238
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,875
I'm afraid I had to punish
Shiro for that stunt.

239
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,666
She should know better
than to use the beach

240
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,000
without my permission. Yes?

241
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,666
Please! I beg your forgiveness,

242
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,583
I won't ever do it again and I
especially won't take anymore

243
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,708
of your stinky seaweed,
I promise!

244
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,041
[NAKANO]
Poor Shiro.

245
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,875
[SENKO]
Eep...

246
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,833
[SORA]
I shall introduce myself.

247
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:37,416
I am a demigod fox who has lived
many thousands of years,

248
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,083
and I go by the name of Sora.

249
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,500
To put it all rather simply,

250
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,875
I am what one might
consider Senko's boss.

251
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,708
It is my pleasure to make your
acquaintance, young sir.

252
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:52,083
[NAKANO]
So this is who Senko reports to?

253
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,333
Now that she mentions it,
I do get a sense

254
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:58,041
that's she a powerful
source of authority.

255
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,125
Right. My name is Nakano.

256
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,541
[NAKANO]
Whoa! She's like, travel-size!

257
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,375
Despite that,

258
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,666
she has a certain...

259
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,750
...larger-than-life feel.

260
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,375
[SORA gasps]

261
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,125
Oh my, it would seem your
wicked eyes have a terrible

262
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,125
habit of wandering. Do you
perhaps find me alluring?

263
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,041
Sorry, I didn't mean to
be boob-- I mean rude!

264
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:27,958
Heh. But what if I gave
you permission to look?

265
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,416
--[NAKANO] Uhh...
--[SENKO gasps]

266
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,291
[SORA]
I don't mind in the slightest.

267
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,708
Whoa! Hey!

268
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,416
Uh L-Lady Sora!

269
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,916
Please, I'd like to request

270
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,750
that you do not toy
with him so freely.

271
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,583
Oh, would you now?

272
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,791
But the poor boy cannot help
it if his eyes should wander.

273
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,791
You refuse to indulge him.

274
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,416
Hold on, that's not completely
true, I mean it's a little true,

275
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,958
but I still indulge
him in other ways,

276
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,875
just probably not in
the ways you're thinking!

277
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,250
It's completely true.

278
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,625
[NAKANO]
Uhh...

279
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,875
It would seem Sen has been
unable to satisfy you thus far.

280
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,708
I, however, am quite different.

281
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,166
There are many things
Sen cannot do.

282
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,708
But I possess talents that
I'm sure would please you.

283
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:33,125
Please, there's no need
to restrain yourself.

284
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,125
You want to, do you not?

285
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,666
[gulps]

286
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,625
I want to...

287
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,625
[SENKO gasps]

288
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,500
Heh.

289
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:49,625
I wanna jam my face right
into your huge, fluffy tail!

290
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,333
Just smother myself with it!

291
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:52,208
Please!

292
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,583
Of course you do.

293
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,166
Huh? My tail?

294
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,125
Yes!

295
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,250
Huh?

296
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,875
He doesn't need you!

297
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,166
Not your tail,

298
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,875
or any other tails,
for that matter!

299
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:14,291
[laughs] Well, isn't
that adorable?

300
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,416
This is quite
the delightful sight.

301
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,625
Even with my body on display,

302
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,916
all you can think
about is my tail.

303
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,166
How odd! You're a man
of strange tastes.

304
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,166
[NAKANO]
Uhh...

305
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,250
He's always been that way.

306
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,625
It's time that I bid you <i>adieu.</i>

307
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,708
Lest the boy touch my tail.

308
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,125
[SENKO grunts]

309
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,416
[sighs]

310
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,333
Oh, before I forget.

311
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:47,000
I do have some advice for you.

312
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:50,416
Regarding that perpetually
tired look on your face--

313
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,083
Do tread lightly.

314
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:55,500
Otherwise, I fear something
bad may happen to you.

315
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,291
So I hope that
you'll be careful.

316
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,958
Uh. What's that mean?

317
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,250
Don't make Sen sad.

318
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,125
That would be very
unwise of you.

319
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,958
What'd she say to you?

320
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,541
Farewell. Until we meet again.

321
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,708
Your boss is a real
force of nature.

322
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,708
Yes.

323
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:22,958
Still though,

324
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,416
I kind of enjoyed seeing
that new side of you.

325
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,583
It was interesting.

326
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:31,375
[gasps] I'm still no
match for Lady Sora.

327
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,416
You know, I wish you would
have at least told me

328
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,291
you knew the person I ran into
when we were back at the beach.

329
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,750
Man, I'm so happy
she's not a ghost.

330
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,250
What are you saying?!

331
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,500
Lady Sora is on a completely
different level

332
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,083
than a silly old ghost!

333
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,708
Compared to her,
a ghost is harmless!

334
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,208
[NAKANO]
'Kay.

335
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,666
More importantly, I've always
taken care of you, right?

336
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,833
Then why are you so enamored
with another fox's tail?

337
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,583
[NAKANO]
Oh, I'm sorry.

338
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,458
I even let you fluff my
tail whenever you want.

339
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,208
But I guess that's not
enough for you, huh?

340
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,458
Uh. Wait.

341
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,625
Hold on just a second.

342
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,000
What now?

343
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,458
Do I detect a hint of...

344
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,291
...jealousy?

345
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,958
[gasps] Whoa!

346
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:21,000
What are you talking about?
There's no way I am jealous!

347
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,041
I would never act so immature!

348
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,333
You don't get it.

349
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:27,166
Lady Sora is an immensely
powerful being!

350
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,625
Touching her tail could
have been real trouble.

351
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,416
Who knows what
would have happened?

352
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,916
Oh.

353
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,541
Therefore, I am not jealous.

354
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,958
It is nothing more than
motherly worry, so there.

355
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,416
[NAKANO]
Uh...

356
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,666
[NAKANO] For a mom,
you sure are adorable.

357
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,125
[SENKO]
Ugh. Don't patronize me!

358
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,125
I will take away your dinner,
young man!

359
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,041
[NAKANO]
I'm so sorry, Mother Senko.

360
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,208
[SENKO groans]

361
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:05,375
[NAKANO] She didn't put a lot
of effort into this meal.

362
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,333
Uhh...

363
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,958
[SENKO]
Hmph.

364
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,458
[NAKANO]
She's definitely mad.

365
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,500
Uh.

366
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:15,375
Otherwise, I fear something
bad may happen to you.

367
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,375
So I hope that
you'll be careful.

368
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,000
Uhh...

369
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,541
[SENKO grumbles]

370
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,375
[NAKANO] Is this what she
meant by something bad?

371
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,041
[SORA]
Don't make Sen sad.

372
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,500
That would be
very unwise of you.

373
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,083
--[NAKANO] Okay.
--[cutlery clinks]

374
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:31,958
[SENKO]
Huh?

375
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:35,333
Uh. This looks delicious!

376
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,000
Thanks for dinner!

377
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:41,791
Oh, wow.

378
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:47,583
Heh. As I recall, you've
always disliked this dish.

379
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,958
Uh?

380
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,958
I expect you to eat every bite.

381
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,333
Right.

382
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,541
Jeez, what's his problem?

383
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,458
That silly boy.
He's as clueless as ever.

384
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,083
[SORA]
Indeed he is.

385
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:07,166
Let us hope that it does
not go beyond that.

386
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,333
[SHIRO]
Huh?

387
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,000
[SORA laughs]

388
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,750
[SENKO]
Super Senko Time!

389
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:02,041
Hurry up, over here!

390
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,916
Look, I made us
an igloo. Ta-dah!

391
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:12,583
It's surprisingly cozy
in here, isn't it?

392
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,250
Yep!

393
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:18,041
Oh, try some <i>amazake</i> !
It'll warm you up in no time!

394
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:21,166
Even with your drink,
you might still be a bit cold.

395
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:25,083
Would you like
to use my fox-fire?

396
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,625
Uh?

397
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,666
I'm so glad that you're happy!

398
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,750
To be honest, it makes my whole
day to see you smile like that.

399
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:36,583
It makes me want
to smile, as well!

400
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:39,875
I really appreciate all the hard
work that you've done today.

401
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:42,750
Sleep well and sweet dreams!
