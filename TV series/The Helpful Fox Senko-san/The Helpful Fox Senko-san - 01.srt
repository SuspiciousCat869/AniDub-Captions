1
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,708
[WOMAN A]
I'm done for the day!

2
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,083
Wanna go grab some food?

3
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,666
[WOMAN B]
Yeah, sure!

00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:43,916
[sighs]

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,166
[NAKANO]
Finally done.

7
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,041
[NAKANO] I'm leaving,
see you tomorrow.

8
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,458
[MITAKA]
Nakano wait!

9
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,000
Sorry!

10
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,166
[NAKANO]
Huh?

11
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,333
A project got messed up.
Can you help out?

12
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,791
[NAKANO]
Me? But I want to go home.

13
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,166
Please, man?

14
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,541
All right.

15
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:09,208
Seriously? Thank you!

16
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,833
[sighs]

17
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:38,250
[YOZORA] Harboring such despair
can bring one's world to ruin.

18
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:43,041
[YOZORA]
But, before that happens,

19
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:46,375
we must attempt to
save the young sir.

20
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:47,708
[SENKO]
Please, send me.

21
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:50,333
[gasps] Why you?!

22
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:53,166
[SENKO] His poor heart
is very troubled,

23
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,333
but I can help free him.

24
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:59,125
All right. I shall grant
you permission, then.

25
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,625
Thank you!

26
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:03,458
[SHIRO]
No way! That's not fair!

27
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,625
Just wait and see.

28
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:13,208
I shall pamper him well.

29
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,625
[NAKANO'S MOM]
Kuroto. It's your mother.

30
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,625
How are you?

31
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,166
We observed the
sixth anniversary

32
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,458
of Grandma's passing today,
but everyone's doing well.

33
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:58,041
Will you make it home
for the Obon Festival?

34
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,416
Give me a call, okay?

35
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,750
[sighs]

36
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:04,666
[train rattles]

37
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,708
Huh?

38
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,458
[COMMUTERS chattering]

39
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,291
[COMMUTER B sighs]

40
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:34,375
[NAKANO] I'm sick of
riding the last train.

41
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:37,541
And I had to skip dinner, again.

42
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,083
[NAKANO]
Wait.

43
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,000
Did I eat the last of
the instant ramen?

44
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,875
Whatever...

45
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,291
[NAKANO] I wonder how
much longer I can do this

46
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,250
before I just collapse
from exhaustion?

47
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:14,833
Huh?

48
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,583
[NAKANO]
Man, something smells good.

49
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,541
[NAKANO] Weird. Did I leave
the lights on this morning?

50
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,458
Hi, welcome home!

51
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,375
Oh my, you must have had
a terribly long day.

52
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,666
Uh... I'm sorry!
Uh, wrong apartment!

53
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,458
[NAKANO]
Hm? Wait. I totally live here.

54
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,875
Hi, welcome home!

55
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:55,708
Oh my, you must have had
a terribly long day.

56
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,458
A dream?

57
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,458
Uh, nope. So...

58
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,750
Yay! You're back!

59
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,041
You've certainly had a long day.

60
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,708
[NAKANO sputtering]

61
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,250
I'm glad you're here.

62
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,000
I've prepared you
a nutritious dinner.

63
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,250
[NAKANO] Why is there a
little girl in my apartment?

64
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,458
More importantly, what's up
with the fluffy ears and tail?

65
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,375
Maybe she lives nearby?

66
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,375
But if someone were to see
her in a grown man's place...

67
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,583
[SENKO]
Mm?

68
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,208
[ONLOOKERS whisper]

69
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:38,000
He always gave off a real
creepy vibe, you know?

70
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,291
[NAKANO'S MOM]
I'm so sorry.

71
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,708
Hopefully my son
gets proper help!

72
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,125
[NAKANO grunts]

73
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,666
[exhales] I'll pretend
like that didn't happen.

74
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,583
[sighs] I need some sleep.

75
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,000
Poor thing, you must
be so exhausted.

76
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,750
[screams]

77
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,500
You can seriously
pass through walls?

78
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,250
Are you like a ghost?

79
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,750
[NAKANO whimpers]

80
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,541
Oh no, this is even
worse than I thought.

81
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,875
Um, hey. Aren't you going
to eat your dinner now?

82
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,291
Uh... Huh?

83
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:20,041
[SENKO]
It's nice and hot!

84
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,541
You've had such a long,
hard day of work.

85
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,375
You must be starving.

86
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,666
[stomach growls]

87
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,458
Yep! So, shall I
make you a plate?

88
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,625
Whoa, I can't eat
at a time like this!

89
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:32,958
Who the heck are you?

90
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,208
And what are you doing
in my apartment?

91
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,041
Uh!

92
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:41,375
[SENKO cries]

93
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,708
That's fine.

94
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,708
I only put my heart
and soul into this meal.

95
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:49,583
But that's okay.
I will discard it for you.

96
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,708
[NAKANO]
Uh...

97
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,333
No, don't do it!

98
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,500
You win! I'll eat it!

99
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,916
[panting]

100
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,041
[SENKO]
Heh!

101
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,250
Excellent!

102
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,875
[sighs]

103
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,625
Looks great.

104
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,416
[SENKO]
Freshly made!

105
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh!

106
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,166
Uh?

107
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,625
[NAKANO] I can't eat
that huge mountain of rice!

108
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,375
Well, try!

109
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,416
Thank you for the meal.

110
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,291
Eat up!

111
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,875
[NAKANO]
This is awkward.

112
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,375
[slurping] Mm!

113
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,750
How is it? Good, right?

114
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,208
It is.

115
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:08,000
[SENKO] I'm glad! You should
try some of the stew next.

116
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:19,375
Wow, it has such a rich flavor.
It reminds me of something.

117
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,000
Like the food my
grandma used to make!

118
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,583
Is that your way of
complimenting dinner?

119
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,666
Yep!

120
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,125
[SENKO]
Heh! Well, in that case then.

121
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,625
I'll have some, too!

122
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,791
[NAKANO] For some reason,
this takes me back.

123
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,958
How many years has it been now?

124
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,833
Yum! Delicious!

125
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,125
[NAKANO] I actually can't
remember the last time

126
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,666
I came home to a hot meal.

127
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,041
[NAKANO] It's kind of nice
not eating alone.

128
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,000
Would you like to have seconds?

129
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,791
Uh. Sure. That sounds great.

130
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:28,500
[NAKANO] Wait, I still don't
know anything about this kid!

131
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,041
I don't wanna be rude
or anything...

132
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,416
[SENKO]
Hm?

133
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,333
[NAKANO]
But can you tell me who you are?

134
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,666
Yes. Of course.

135
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,250
I go by the name of Senko.

136
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,625
And I'm an 800-year-old
servant of the gods.

137
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,958
A fox demigod!

138
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:53,166
[NAKANO]
A fox... demigod?

139
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,791
[NAKANO]
Let me get this straight.

140
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,791
You're a... demigod?

141
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,125
That's right!

142
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,708
And you're supposedly
like 800 years old?

143
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:13,000
Uh, but you look
more like a little kid.

144
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,500
Would you please quit
with the rice mountains?

145
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,750
But you need to eat to
regain your strength!

146
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,416
You should have some
more stew, as well.

147
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,541
Uh, question.

148
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,375
Did you get these
ingredients from my kitchen?

149
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,000
[SENKO]
No, I brought them with me.

150
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,250
Ah...

151
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,416
They are delicious.
Where did you get them from?

152
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,000
Oh.

153
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,916
They were just some offerings
that people left at the shrine.

154
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,875
[NAKANO]
Uhh...

155
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,916
[NAKANO] Is it okay for me
to eat their offerings?

156
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,791
Is something the matter?

157
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,916
[NAKANO]
No, it's just...

158
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,750
To be honest, I'm still not
quite sure why you came here.

159
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:01,666
Heh! I simply couldn't stand
to see you looking so worn down,

160
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,583
so I decided to help you!

161
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,250
Worn down?

162
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,958
Look, it's not that I
don't appreciate it--

163
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,375
I just don't get
why you chose me.

164
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,333
Listen to me carefully.

165
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:20,041
Uh. 'Kay.

166
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:23,333
If you must know the truth...

167
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,083
[NAKANO]
Yeah?

168
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:28,208
[gulps]

169
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,541
You're just the type of
young man that I prefer!

170
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,750
Are you kidding me?!

171
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,500
Do I look like I'm joking?

172
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,750
Uh. No.

173
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:39,250
Sorry I guess gods don't
need a real reason, huh?

174
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,500
Perhaps it's because I'm
indebted to your family.

175
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,875
[NAKANO]
Huh?

176
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,833
Look. I just want to pamper
you for a little bit.

177
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,583
Is that so bad?

178
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:49,916
No.

179
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,708
[NAKANO]
Thank you for dinner.

180
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:59,875
[SENKO]
It was my pleasure.

181
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,708
Was everything to your liking?

182
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,541
Yes. I'm so stuffed
I can barely move.

183
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,750
[SENKO]
Then, mission accomplished!

184
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,333
Ah... This tea's great.

185
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,625
From now on, I shall serve
you tea after every meal!

186
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,958
It'll be much better for
you than all that coffee.

187
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,583
I'm sure that your poor
stomach could use a break.

188
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,833
Uh? You know about that?

189
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,708
I've been watching
you for a while.

190
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,041
Watching me...?

191
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,708
Oh! I'll take those!

192
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:28,958
No, I've got it.

193
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,916
You just sit there
and focus on relaxing.

194
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,125
[NAKANO]
But I--

195
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,750
Better drink that tea
before it gets cold!

196
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,291
A good luck stalk.

197
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,500
[NAKANO'S GRANDMA]
Kuroto? Would you like a snack?

198
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,833
Yeah!

199
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:07,000
Huh? Ooh! Look, Grandma!

200
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,000
Good luck!

201
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,333
[NAKANO'S GRANDMA]
Ooh... Heh, heh.

202
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,625
Hey, were these tea leaves
that I had in my cupboard?

203
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,000
No, I brought them
along with me.

204
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,375
[NAKANO]
Oh, I'm sorry.

205
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,875
Don't apologize.

206
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,791
Now, why don't you
tell me some other ways

207
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,250
you'd like to be pampered?

208
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:26,166
I guess I don't really know.

209
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,666
There must be something!

210
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,000
[NAKANO]
Mm!

211
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,750
[NAKANO gasping]

212
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,375
[NAKANO]
Well, maybe...

213
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,708
[SENKO]
Go on.

214
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,166
Um, would it be okay for me
to touch your tail?

215
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,166
[gasps] Say what now?

216
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,416
I-It's fine. Never mind, sorry.

217
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:57,041
[SENKO] Well, if that
will make you happy.

218
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:01,291
I... rarely allow this, but...

219
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,166
[SENKO]
My goodness.

220
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,041
This is truly a strange request.

221
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,791
Uh, is it really?

222
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,708
You may proceed.

223
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,291
[NAKANO]
Incredible!

224
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,041
The color is breathtakingly
beautiful.

225
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:22,875
It's like an explosion
of golden, shiny, fluff!

226
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,250
And just to be clear,
you really don't mind?

227
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,166
It's okay!

228
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,375
[gasps]

229
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,583
[NAKANO]
It's so fluffy.

230
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,208
Eep!

231
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,000
[NAKANO]
Your tail is so soft.

232
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:48,000
I feel like I could
do this all day.

233
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,541
This is next-level luxurious.

234
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,750
Like if a hug materialized
in the form of fox fur.

235
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:58,125
Honestly. The commentary
seems a little unnecessary!

236
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,750
[gasps]

237
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,500
Oh, I'm sorry!
I didn't hurt you, did I?

238
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,750
I'm fine.

239
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,500
There's nothing for
you to worry about.

240
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,666
You may pet my tail
as long as you want.

241
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,666
Thanks!

242
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,166
[SENKO whimpers]

243
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,416
[NAKANO exhales]

244
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:22,125
[SENKO screams]

245
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:32,125
[NAKANO sighs]
Thank you so much!

246
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,125
Uh. Do you feel better now?

247
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,250
Yeah, probably
better than ever!

248
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,875
That's wonderful; it pleases
me to see you so happy.

249
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:43,250
Uh? Crap, I messed up
your pretty tail!

250
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,708
It reminded me of petting
our family's cat.

251
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,041
I'm really sorry.

252
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,125
It's okay!

253
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,333
Because now it's
just nice and fluffy.

254
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:54,083
Ugh, I feel bad that you've
done so much for me tonight,

255
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:57,416
but I haven't done one
single thing for you.

256
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,375
[laughs] That's so cute.

257
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,916
What?

258
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,875
There was only one thing
I wanted tonight,

259
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,375
and that was to see your smile.

260
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,916
Is that really enough though?

261
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,916
A little girl like you
shouldn't have to help out

262
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,166
a grown man like me.

263
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,625
How funny!

264
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,916
Need I remind you that
I am 800 years old,

265
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,541
so you're the little one!

266
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,500
Okay. But if this goes on,

267
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,958
I'll be a lazy bum.

268
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,750
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

269
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:27,916
[gasps]

270
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:33,041
[SENKO] Every person in the
world has their faults, even me,

271
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,500
and I've had 800 years
to figure them all out.

272
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,916
For what it's worth,

273
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,583
I already think you're
working hard enough.

274
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,958
I did these things for you
tonight because I felt like it.

275
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,666
So, please stop
worrying so much.

276
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,625
[NAKANO]
Uh...

277
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,750
Might I add, you're overlooking

278
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,666
a very critical detail
concerning demigods.

279
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,583
Oh, and what's that?

280
00:17:56,666 --> 00:18:00,041
[SENKO] Care from a fox demigod
is considered priceless.

281
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:03,250
No amount of good deeds
could ever earn it.

282
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,666
That's why you need to
stop being a worry-wart

283
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,250
and let me pamper you!

284
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,583
[NAKANO]
Mm.

285
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,833
Lie down.

286
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,708
[NAKANO]
Uh...

287
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,958
You must be so exhausted.

288
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,750
[NAKANO whimpers]

289
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,208
Now come here and
let me spoil you.

290
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,750
You deserve to rest a bit.

291
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,291
[SENKO]
I'm here to take care of you.

292
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,916
[exhales]

293
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:20,500
Where are you? Grandma!

294
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:21,500
[SENKO]
Over here.

295
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:22,708
Huh?

296
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,625
[SENKO]
This way.

297
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,291
Come back!

298
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,250
[NAKANO'S GRANDMA]
Kuroto!

299
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,541
[NAKANO]
Huh? Grandma!

300
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,166
[gasping]

301
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,500
There.

302
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,416
Whoa. Did I fall asleep?

303
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,125
Possibly.

304
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,166
There's no way.

305
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,583
Your skin tone. It looks much
brighter than earlier.

306
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:21,916
And your body appears to be

307
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,166
much more relaxed than
when you got home.

308
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,541
[NAKANO]
Uh. Hey. Yeah, you're right.

309
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,250
It feels lighter somehow.

310
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,875
Honestly, I can't
thank you enough.

311
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,750
Please. You don't
have to thank me.

312
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,166
Besides, believe it or not,

313
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,875
this is only the beginning
of your new pampered life.

314
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,875
You're going to be so spoiled!

315
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,291
[laughs]

316
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,625
[NAKANO] Does that mean I
can touch your tail again?

317
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:49,000
[SENKO] We're going to have to
put a daily limit on that one!

318
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:26,041
[SENKO]
Super Senko Time!

319
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:31,541
Uh? Hello, welcome home!

320
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:34,250
Oh my, you must've had
a terribly long day.

321
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,583
Please, come in.

322
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:38,291
Just relax and I'll
handle everything.

323
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:47,833
Here. This is my favorite
tea, called "Houjicha."

325
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,208
I think it has a
very nice flavor.

326
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,958
And a lovely aroma, as well!

328
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,541
Oh, would you like to know
how to brew a pot yourself?

329
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,250
Great! Let's get started.

330
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:06,000
So, first you pour the
hot water into the pot,

331
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,875
then you let the roasted
tea leaves soak.

332
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:13,333
Okay, then. Think,

333
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:17,250
"I want this to be delicious!"
as your pouring it into the cup.

334
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:18,875
That make sense?

335
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:22,083
Good!

336
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,416
Hot tea's perfect to
have right before bed.

337
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,333
Not only will it
bring you lots of joy,

338
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:31,083
it'll also soothe your soul!
I highly recommend it.

339
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,666
Thank you for all of your
hard work today.

340
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,250
You should head to bed.

341
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:38,333
A full night of sleep will help
you feel fresh in the morning!

342
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,208
Okay. I hope you rest well!

343
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:43,958
Good night and sweet dreams.
