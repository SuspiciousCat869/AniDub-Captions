00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,108
[keyboard clacking]

2
00:00:18,775 --> 00:00:21,983
[NAKANO yawns]
All done!

3
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:23,858
I can finally go home.

4
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,942
[NAKANO] I wonder what we're
having for dinner tonight?

5
00:00:34,025 --> 00:00:35,983
[NAKANO] I feel like Senko
just up and appeared

6
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:38,233
out of nowhere one day.

7
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:41,067
But now I'm kinda used
to having her around.

8
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,358
It certainly has its perks.

9
00:00:43,442 --> 00:00:46,483
With Senko around so much, I've
gotten used to having access

10
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:48,983
to fluffy fluff 27/7.

11
00:00:54,817 --> 00:00:56,733
[NAKANO] I need to find a
way to show my gratitude

12
00:00:56,817 --> 00:00:58,567
for all this special treatment.

13
00:01:04,317 --> 00:01:06,692
Uh, Senko?
Permission to fluff fur?

14
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,483
My goodness,
you're incorrigible.

15
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:10,942
[NAKANO]
You know.

16
00:01:11,025 --> 00:01:13,733
Maybe I've been
too indulgent lately.

17
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:16,108
[NAKANO]
I'm back.

18
00:01:18,817 --> 00:01:19,900
[NAKANO]
Uh.

19
00:01:20,858 --> 00:01:22,942
Hello, and welcome home!

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,525
[NAKANO]
Uhh...

21
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:33,067
[NAKANO]
Another one?

22
00:03:06,317 --> 00:03:07,900
So you're him, huh?

23
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:09,233
Nakano?

24
00:03:09,317 --> 00:03:11,400
Uh, yes?

25
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,942
My name is Shiro!

26
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:16,775
And I am renowned as
an Inari demigod fox!

27
00:03:16,858 --> 00:03:18,650
[SENKO]
I'm sorry I didn't ask.

28
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:20,942
She said she'll leave right
after she eats dinner,

29
00:03:21,025 --> 00:03:22,983
is that okay?

30
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:26,983
If you don't mind the
cramped space, then sure.

31
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:28,858
Besides, food is always
more delicious

32
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,942
when you're with good company.

33
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:34,358
I agree. I appreciate
your understanding.

34
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:40,317
[SENKO]
Here!

35
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:43,692
[NAKANO]
Thank you, Senko.

36
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,400
Let's dig in!

37
00:03:47,483 --> 00:03:48,942
[NAKANO]
Wow...

38
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,442
[NAKANO]
Aah...

39
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:59,067
Twice the floof
under just one roof!

40
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:01,608
[SHIRO]
Excuse me?

41
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:04,942
Is there a reason you're staring
at me with such wicked eyes?

42
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:06,650
Uh, no, I'm sorry!

43
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:10,400
I was just admiring your tail--
it's so pretty and white.

44
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:13,025
Oh, I see. Naturally.

45
00:04:13,108 --> 00:04:16,442
I suppose I can't blame
you for staring at it.

46
00:04:16,525 --> 00:04:19,900
I'm not surprised that
it captivates you.

47
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:23,858
My snow-white tail, serves
as proof of my pure lineage!

48
00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:25,150
[NAKANO gasping]

49
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:26,317
[SHIRO laughs]

50
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:27,900
[gasping]

51
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:29,233
The rice stuck to your face

52
00:04:29,317 --> 00:04:30,817
makes it a little
less impressive.

53
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,858
[NAKANO]
She's not wrong.

54
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,192
[NAKANO]
Thank you for dinner!

55
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,775
Yes, thank you!

56
00:04:37,858 --> 00:04:41,317
As usual, Sen, your fried tofu
was cooked to perfection!

57
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,483
For real. It was delicious!

58
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:46,442
Good, I'm happy to hear it!

59
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:49,275
Hardly surprising. Sen's
the best fried tofu cook

60
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:50,983
of all the fox demigods!

61
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:53,733
Oh, she is?
I could see that.

62
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:55,608
I'm sure she's just
exaggerating.

63
00:04:55,692 --> 00:04:57,483
[SHIRO]
I most certainly am not!

64
00:04:57,567 --> 00:05:01,108
Trust me, I love fried tofu and
yours is exceptionally good!

65
00:05:01,192 --> 00:05:03,108
I stuffed myself silly!

66
00:05:03,192 --> 00:05:05,858
And who's fault might that be?

67
00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:08,442
I guess foxes like
fried tofu, huh?

68
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:12,358
I didn't know it was
such a favorite.

69
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:14,483
I wouldn't say it's our
absolute favorite.

70
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:15,858
[NAKANO]
Oh?

71
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:18,275
We are foxes, so technically
we're both omnivores.

72
00:05:18,358 --> 00:05:20,650
Believe it or not, we're
a big fans of most meat.

73
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:22,317
[NAKANO]
I didn't know that.

74
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,942
Yes, fried tofu is
actually a substitute.

75
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,858
Cause people used to
give us mouse tempura.

76
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:29,858
Well that's an interesting
way to cook a mouse.

77
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:32,233
I'm surprised you didn't
know about that, Nakano.

78
00:05:32,317 --> 00:05:33,567
Uh, sorry.

79
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,067
It wasn't that uncommon for us

80
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,067
to get a ton of fried
tofu as offerings.

81
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,650
Wow, that's a ton!

82
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:41,650
We didn't want to be wasteful,
so I'd find new ways to cook it.

83
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,067
And I guess after
so much of that,

84
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,192
it felt weird if
we didn't eat it.

85
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:47,942
[NAKANO]
I see. And now it's a habit.

86
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:50,150
Yep. I suppose, anyway.

87
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:53,025
Oh, but cooking it every
day must be a bit much.

88
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:56,650
I'm sure that you're tired of
eating it all the time, huh?

89
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:58,817
I'll find some other
things to make you.

90
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,650
[NAKANO]
It's fine.

91
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:00,817
Yeah?

92
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,400
You don't have to change
anything for me.

93
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:06,608
I'd feel weird if I
didn't eat your tofu.

94
00:06:06,692 --> 00:06:09,025
Guess I've gotten
used to it now.

95
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:13,358
[SENKO] Are you sure
you're not secretly a fox?

96
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:14,692
[NAKANO]
Pretty sure,

97
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:17,275
I'm definitely lacking the
ears and the tail part.

98
00:06:19,775 --> 00:06:22,483
Well, good! Because you'd look
silly with those things.

99
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:23,900
[SENKO]
Now that you've eaten,

100
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,400
isn't it about time for
you to head back home, Shiro?

101
00:06:26,483 --> 00:06:27,858
Not quite yet.

102
00:06:27,942 --> 00:06:29,400
You see, there's
more to my visit

103
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:31,692
than the desire to eat
your cooking, Sen.

104
00:06:31,775 --> 00:06:33,150
[gasps]

105
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:36,442
Right. I also have
business with Nakano.

106
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:38,275
Me, really?

107
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,608
[SHIRO]
Now then...

108
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:44,983
Those who worship me
are always happy.

109
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:48,942
However, you my dear,
look particularly worn out.

110
00:06:49,025 --> 00:06:50,358
Poor thing.

111
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:53,317
You must be exhausted
from your long day at work.

112
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,192
And that is why I'll
give you a treat.

113
00:06:57,275 --> 00:07:00,400
Just this once,
you may pet my head!

114
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:01,733
--[SENKO sighs]
--[NAKANO] U-Uh...

115
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:06,150
[NAKANO]
Are you sure this is all right?

116
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:09,358
You're not going to get
mad and smite me, are you?

117
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:11,275
Of course not, I would never.

118
00:07:11,358 --> 00:07:12,358
[SENKO grumbles]

119
00:07:12,442 --> 00:07:14,483
Well, okay.

120
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:18,317
[SENKO grumbles]

121
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,775
Yes, good! Just like that.

122
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,442
[NAKANO]
Whoa. This is amazing.

123
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:32,400
She looks so happy.

124
00:07:32,483 --> 00:07:37,150
And it's like that happiness is
flowing into me when I pet her.

125
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,108
[SENKO]
Uh...

126
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:52,983
You can pet me. If you want.

127
00:07:55,317 --> 00:07:56,400
[SHIRO laughs]

128
00:08:01,692 --> 00:08:03,358
Uh, here goes.

129
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:09,858
You like to get pet, huh?

130
00:08:09,942 --> 00:08:13,400
Sure. Once in a while.

131
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:15,608
[NAKANO]
I can't believe it.

132
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:17,858
It's double the fluff!

133
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,442
[NAKANO]
Wow.

134
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:23,942
I feel like I've died and
gone straight to heaven!

135
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:25,983
[NAKANO gasping]

[gasps]

140
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:55,275
What lovely petting!
I like you, Nakano.

141
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:57,108
Okay. Thank you?

142
00:08:57,192 --> 00:09:00,233
I shall give you a reward.
Tell me what you'd like.

143
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:01,483
I'm not really sure.

144
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:03,317
Whoa! Hold on just a minute!

145
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,067
[SHIRO]
Stay out of this, Sen.

146
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,817
I wouldn't even be here if you
were actually satisfying him.

147
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,733
[gasps]

148
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,067
Uh. Hang on.

149
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,442
Senko's doing a great job!
She's been a huge help.

150
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:18,817
Come, there's no need
to restrain yourself.

151
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,942
Just relax and give in.

152
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:24,400
There's nothing you can hide
when you're around me.

153
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:26,067
My eyes see all.

154
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,775
More importantly,
my eyes know all.

155
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:38,233
Shiro! [gasps]

156
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:42,400
[SHIRO] Release the desires that
dwell deep within your heart!

157
00:09:42,483 --> 00:09:44,358
Tell me what they are!

158
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:48,775
[NAKANO]
The desires... in my heart...

159
00:09:50,817 --> 00:09:52,775
Now!

160
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,692
[NAKANO]
Let me.

161
00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:56,317
[SHIRO]
"Let me"?

162
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
[BOTH]
Fluff your...

163
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,400
Hold on, you want
to fluff my tail?

164
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,150
That beautiful fur as
white as the driven snow.

165
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:13,983
It's so pretty. I've wanted
to pet it all night.

166
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:16,692
You have to let me fluff it,
just a little!

167
00:10:16,775 --> 00:10:20,275
No way! Don't touch it!

168
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:22,942
Listen to me! Wait, Nakano!

169
00:10:23,025 --> 00:10:24,442
No! Don't touch me!

170
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:25,275
Stay away!

171
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,942
[NAKANO moans]

172
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:29,150
[SHIRO whimpers]
Sen, please help me!

173
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:29,983
No.

174
00:10:30,067 --> 00:10:31,317
[SHIRO]
Sen!

175
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,983
[gasps]

176
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,567
Fluffy fluff!

177
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,150
[SHIRO screams]

178
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:42,858
[whimpers]

179
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,983
Did you see that, the fluffy
fluff went through the wall!

180
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:49,108
--It's gone forever...
--[SENKO] Please calm down.

181
00:10:49,192 --> 00:10:54,775
[KOENJI groaning] I am beyond
done with this stupid drawing!

182
00:10:54,858 --> 00:11:00,192
I just wanna pet cats for a
living, is that so much to ask?

183
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:04,483
I'll get an imaginary cat!
Who's a good kitty, Tama?

184
00:11:06,275 --> 00:11:07,733
[screams]

185
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:13,275
Hi!

186
00:11:13,358 --> 00:11:15,025
Hi.

187
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,525
Uh. Tama?

188
00:11:16,608 --> 00:11:19,650
Who's Tama? I'm Shiro.

189
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:22,775
My apologies.

190
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:26,025
[door opens, closes]

191
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:30,775
I guess I'm hallucinating
now, so yeah, that's cool.

192
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:33,692
On second thought,
I'mma sleep now.

193
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:35,233
G'night.

194
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:39,192
[SENKO]
Come on, it's not so bad.

195
00:11:39,275 --> 00:11:42,400
It'll be okay, I have
a tail too, you know.

196
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,817
[NAKANO]
True.

197
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,817
[NAKANO]
Aww, Shiro's tail.

198
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,358
I wanted to fluff it so badly.

199
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:02,983
[SHIRO] Look after <i>that</i> boy?
You must be kidding.

200
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:06,817
There's no way I'll be
pampering him anytime soon.

201
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,233
Bleh!

202
00:12:17,317 --> 00:12:19,067
[NAKANO]
I'm home...

203
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,150
[SENKO]
Hello and welcome back!

204
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:22,817
[water running]

205
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:30,733
[VOICE]
Your bathwater is now ready.

206
00:12:41,317 --> 00:12:42,817
Good.

207
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:48,733
[SENKO] Are you okay?
The bath is all ready to use.

208
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:50,192
Right. Thanks.

209
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:51,483
Do you mind if I go first?

210
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:52,942
No, be my guest!

211
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:54,400
Actually, now that
I'm over here,

212
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,817
you do have a bit of a
strong scent to you.

213
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,900
I'd prefer you don't smell me.

214
00:12:58,983 --> 00:13:03,067
I'm sorry Senko. I had to spend
all night at the office

215
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,983
and there's no way for
me to shower there.

216
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:07,400
That must have been
very hard for you.

217
00:13:07,483 --> 00:13:08,983
Well, after you've
had your bath,

218
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:10,817
you can go straight
to sleep if you'd like.

219
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,983
I'll go take care of it
right now, thank you.

220
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:16,942
[NAKANO groans]

221
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:31,608
[splash]

222
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:33,358
[sighs]

223
00:13:35,483 --> 00:13:37,650
[NAKANO]
I love baths.

224
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,150
The heat does
wonders for my back.

225
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:42,650
I could fall asleep right now.

226
00:13:49,275 --> 00:13:50,567
[knocking]

227
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,983
[SENKO]
Excuse me.

228
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:53,692
Yeah, what's up?

229
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,192
You must be tired.

230
00:13:58,275 --> 00:14:00,900
Would you like for me
to scrub your back?

231
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:05,900
[NAKANO]
Hard pass.

232
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:08,942
Please. There's no
need to be shy.

233
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:10,483
[gasping]

234
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:12,983
It's going to take way more than
a silly door to keep me out.

235
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:15,567
So you might as well
just give in, already.

236
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,650
[sighs] Right, you
move through walls.

237
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,317
[SENKO]
Don't worry.

238
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,567
I'm only going to
scrub your back.

239
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,858
It's all innocent, okay?

240
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:28,358
[NAKANO] Even if she is
over 800 years old,

241
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:30,192
she's still a woman.

242
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:32,192
[NAKANO]
Hang on a second.

243
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:34,067
What's the matter?

244
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,317
Can you at least
put a towel on?

245
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,608
Do I really need to?

246
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:40,567
I'm built more like a
plateau than a mountain,

247
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,442
so there's not much to see.

248
00:14:42,525 --> 00:14:45,775
Well, if it doesn't matter
to you, then whatever.

249
00:14:45,858 --> 00:14:49,442
Uh. But maybe in return, you
could let me scrub your back.

250
00:14:49,525 --> 00:14:51,567
As a thanks for
always helping me out.

251
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,733
[SENKO]
Heh. You're so thoughtful!

252
00:14:53,817 --> 00:14:55,108
[gasps]

253
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:57,400
[NAKANO] I'll be able to
see the base of her tail!

254
00:14:57,483 --> 00:14:58,692
[NAKANO laughs]

255
00:14:58,775 --> 00:14:59,775
[SENKO]
Huh?

256
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,817
[SENKO humming]

257
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,817
[NAKANO] It kinda feels weird to
be in this tiny bath with her.

258
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,108
But nothing ventured,
nothing gained!

259
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:13,275
Okay, it's all soaped
up and ready to go!

260
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:15,567
[NAKANO gasps]

261
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:21,525
[NAKANO]
Her hands are so warm.

262
00:15:21,608 --> 00:15:24,483
The scrubbing is rough
but also gentle.

263
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:27,858
A perfect balance
between the two.

264
00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:30,317
Having someone else scrub
these hard to reach places

265
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,358
so thoroughly feels
simply amazing!

266
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:36,358
If you don't mind, can you move
to the right a little bit?

267
00:15:36,442 --> 00:15:37,608
Is this better?

268
00:15:37,692 --> 00:15:40,108
Yes, it feels wonderful!
Thanks so much.

269
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:41,650
My pleasure.

270
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,483
[NAKANO]
Now that I think about it,

271
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:48,942
I feel like this moment should
be really uncomfortable,

272
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:50,483
but it's not.

273
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:52,025
Instead...

274
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:54,817
I just feel utterly at ease.

275
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,400
[NAKANO]
I guess in a way

276
00:15:58,483 --> 00:16:00,858
it reminds me of my
childhood a bit.

277
00:16:00,942 --> 00:16:04,817
It's like...
bathing with my family.

278
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,942
[SENKO] Any other spots
in need of scrubbing?

279
00:16:07,025 --> 00:16:07,942
I'm good.

280
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:10,442
Okay then,
I shall rinse you off.

281
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,942
[sighs]

282
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:20,567
It sounds like that was
rather relaxing for you.

283
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,567
Yes, it was, you've got a real
knack for back scrubbing.

284
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,442
Well that's good to know,
I'm very glad to hear it.

285
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:29,900
[NAKANO] Okay, let's switch
places so I can repay the favor.

286
00:16:29,983 --> 00:16:32,442
[SENKO laughs]
All right, sounds like a plan.

287
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,317
Okay then, are you ready?

288
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,858
Yep!

289
00:16:38,025 --> 00:16:39,942
Hey, you're pretty
good at scrubbing!

290
00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:41,942
Thanks, I'm trying.

291
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:45,483
[NAKANO]
It seems so odd.

292
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:49,067
But I never noticed how small
her back was before now.

293
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,400
Her skin is so
incredibly soft.

294
00:16:51,483 --> 00:16:53,775
And her tail...

295
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:57,817
Wow. It's so cool
to see it like this.

296
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,317
Ready to rinse off?

297
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,692
[SENKO]
Sure!

298
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,150
[NAKANO gasps]

299
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:15,067
[SENKO]
Is something wrong?

300
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,900
Your face looks like you've
just seen a ghost.

301
00:17:18,983 --> 00:17:21,525
[NAKANO]
Rest in peace, fluff.

302
00:17:24,483 --> 00:17:26,025
[sighs]

303
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:28,150
There's nothing better
than a hot bath.

304
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:29,567
True.

305
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,525
It feels kinda like we're
a family bathing together.

306
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:34,900
Yeah? If that's the case,

307
00:17:34,983 --> 00:17:36,650
I guess that makes
me the mother.

308
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:39,650
[laughs] It reminds me
of something.

309
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:41,025
A trick we used to do.

310
00:17:41,108 --> 00:17:43,150
Oh, will you please
show it to me?

311
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:44,900
[NAKANO]
Prepare to be amazed!

312
00:17:44,983 --> 00:17:47,692
[gasps] That was very amusing!

313
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,858
When I was a little kid,

314
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,192
I'd shoot water with
my hands constantly.

315
00:17:51,275 --> 00:17:52,233
[SENKO]
Hm?

316
00:18:02,108 --> 00:18:04,817
Give it a try, Senko.

317
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,650
'Kay! Just like this?

318
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:07,692
Yep.

319
00:18:07,775 --> 00:18:09,775
And go!

320
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:12,233
I win!

321
00:18:12,317 --> 00:18:13,983
Your shooting is quite superior.

322
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:15,108
Uh.

323
00:18:16,483 --> 00:18:18,275
[NAKANO] Did I just get
excited over winning

324
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:20,983
a water shooting contest?

325
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:25,983
[SENKO]
To be honest.

326
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:27,483
[NAKANO]
Hm?

327
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:30,108
You just seemed so out of it
when you came home earlier.

328
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,442
I thought you might
fall asleep and drown.

329
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:34,442
I wanted to check on you.

330
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:41,400
Please don't push
yourself too hard.

331
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:46,108
I'm sorry to make you
worry about me.

332
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,317
I promise I'll try to be better.

333
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,150
[SENKO]
You've got it all wrong, silly!

334
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:51,608
Uh?

335
00:18:51,692 --> 00:18:54,400
Have you forgotten
what I came here for?

336
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:57,108
If your job is wearing
you out that much,

337
00:18:57,192 --> 00:18:58,900
then you should
just tell me that.

338
00:18:58,983 --> 00:19:00,733
So I can take care of you.

339
00:19:00,817 --> 00:19:02,650
Do you really mean it?

340
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:04,733
Whether it's work or a bath,

341
00:19:04,817 --> 00:19:06,983
no matter what,
I won't let you drown.

342
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:08,317
[gasps]

343
00:19:17,108 --> 00:19:19,775
[NAKANO]
I appreciate that.

344
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,025
Although to be fair,

345
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:23,025
this bath is a little
small for two people.

346
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:24,358
I suppose.

347
00:19:24,442 --> 00:19:25,900
Oh, I know!

348
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:28,525
I should take you to the secret
magical hot spring sometime!

349
00:19:28,608 --> 00:19:29,900
Oh, like a fox hot spring?

350
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:33,733
Yep! It's quite large
with a lovely view!

351
00:19:33,817 --> 00:19:37,525
[NAKANO]
Cool! That sounds really fun.

352
00:19:37,608 --> 00:19:38,858
I look forward to it.

353
00:19:38,942 --> 00:19:40,275
[SENKO]
Noted!

354
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:43,233
[hair dryer whirrs]

355
00:19:46,692 --> 00:19:47,942
[sighs]

356
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,442
[NAKANO]
That was an awesome bath.

357
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:57,692
But I wonder if her tail
will go back to normal?

358
00:19:57,775 --> 00:19:59,567
[SENKO]
Ah, that's better.

359
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,983
You know what?

360
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:04,400
I'm starting to grow quite
fond of your "hair dryer."

361
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,400
[gasping]

362
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,108
Whoa, it's a miracle,
your tail is back to normal!

363
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:14,900
[SENKO]
Yes, of course it is.

364
00:20:14,983 --> 00:20:16,858
As I'm sure you
probably already know,

365
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:20,192
tails are very important
to us demigod foxes.

366
00:20:20,275 --> 00:20:22,067
That's why no matter
how busy I get,

367
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,025
I always take the time
to properly maintain it.

368
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:28,442
Gotta make sure
it's in tip-top shape!

369
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:31,192
--It's so fluffy!
--[SENKO] Easy!

370
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:33,442
Uh. I'm sorry,
I couldn't help it.

371
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:36,150
My goodness, I'm starting
to think your love for fluff

372
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:37,692
is a little troubling.

373
00:20:37,775 --> 00:20:38,942
Oh, is it okay?

374
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:40,942
[SENKO]
Mm-hm.

375
00:20:41,025 --> 00:20:42,817
Um. Earlier I was thinking...

376
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,567
that maybe I indulge in
this a bit too much.

377
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,442
[SENKO]
Maybe, but...

378
00:20:47,525 --> 00:20:49,983
If it's something that
makes you feel better,

379
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:52,192
then I'm happy to oblige!

380
00:20:53,858 --> 00:20:54,650
Thanks.

381
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:56,233
[SENKO]
Of course.

382
00:20:56,317 --> 00:20:57,775
[NAKANO]
So I'm free to pet it?

383
00:20:57,858 --> 00:20:59,108
Yep.

384
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,150
[NAKANO]
Mm! Fluffy fluff!

385
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:03,692
[SENKO]
Eep!

386
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:05,900
Be careful, okay?
It's sensitive!

387
00:21:05,983 --> 00:21:09,067
[NAKANO] I was able to fluff
to my heart's content.

388
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,692
All thanks to Senko.

389
00:22:45,025 --> 00:22:47,275
[SENKO]
Super Senko Time!

390
00:22:49,317 --> 00:22:50,900
[SENKO]
Hi, welcome home!

391
00:22:50,983 --> 00:22:55,067
You must have had
a terribly long day.

392
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,317
It seems as though we've had
nothing but rainy weather

393
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,900
these past few days.

394
00:22:58,983 --> 00:23:01,817
I'm afraid it's made a real
mess out of my tail.

395
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,358
As you may have already noticed,

396
00:23:03,442 --> 00:23:06,942
it's not quite as fluffy
as it usually is.

397
00:23:07,025 --> 00:23:10,067
So I thought I'd give it a
good old fashioned combing!

398
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,650
♪ Combing my tail,
get out the knots, ♪

399
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:15,442
♪ brushy brush brush,
So it's nice n' soft ♪

400
00:23:15,525 --> 00:23:17,358
There! How's that?

401
00:23:17,442 --> 00:23:20,442
Would you like to fluff
it a little bit?

402
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,483
I should warn you my
tail is sensitive,

403
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,858
so touching it startles
me sometimes,

404
00:23:24,942 --> 00:23:27,358
but I don't want you to worry.

405
00:23:27,442 --> 00:23:31,442
As long as it relaxes you, then
that's all that matters to me.

406
00:23:31,525 --> 00:23:33,733
If it helps you after
a long day of work,

407
00:23:33,817 --> 00:23:36,567
then you have my
permission to fluff away!

408
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,025
Thank you for all of
your hard work today.

409
00:23:39,108 --> 00:23:41,733
Once you're done fluffing,
it's off to bed with you.

410
00:23:41,817 --> 00:23:44,233
Good night, and sweet dreams.
