[vacuum whirs]

3
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,000
All done!

4
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:23,583
Now everything is
nice and clean!

5
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,791
Thanks for your assistance,
Mister Vacuum.

6
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:31,000
Okay, then. What should I
make for dinner tonight?

7
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:36,375
[gasps] This is...

8
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:55,416
[NAKANO]
Where are you? Grandma!

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,708
[SENKO]
Over here.

10
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:57,875
Huh?

11
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:01,125
This way.

12
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,000
Wait come back!

13
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,625
[NAKANO panting]

Kuroto!

15
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:15,291
Huh? Grandma!

16
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:21,250
Uh?

17
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,416
[NAKANO gasping]

18
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:37,750
Thanks so much!

19
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,583
Uh?

20
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,125
Sweet.

21
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:55,583
What a nice memory.

22
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,791
Uh? Huh?

23
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,458
[SENKO] It's going
to be a rough night.

24
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,291
I should prepare.

25
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,500
Hey, I'm back.

26
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,666
Uh?

27
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,708
[NAKANO]
Mm?

28
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,250
I'm so glad that
you're finally home.

29
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,416
It looks like you've
had another long day.

30
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,583
Uh? A <i>noren</i> ? Man, you've really

31
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,250
taken things to the next
level today, haven't you?

32
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,708
[SENKO laughs]

33
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,291
Uh-huh! I thought you'd like it.

34
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,583
Your new apron is
also very pretty.

35
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,916
If you're trying to
flatter me, it's working.

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,416
So, is tonight a special
occasion or something?

37
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,791
No, sometimes you just need
to change things up.

38
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,125
In fact, I was thinking about
serving some alcohol

39
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,541
with tonight's dinner.

40
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,291
[NAKANO]
Heh! That sounds good!

41
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,583
A drink would really hit
the spot right about now.

42
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,500
[SENKO]
Then consider it done!

43
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,583
[NAKANO]
Uhh...

44
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,875
[NAKANO gasping]
Wow. Awesome!

45
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,875
Thank you!

46
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:35,833
[NAKANO]
Okay.

47
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,250
[SENKO, NAKANO]
Cheers!

48
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,416
[BOTH sigh]

49
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,833
So good!

50
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,875
Yes, I agree!

51
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:48,291
It really hits the spot,
doesn't it?

52
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,791
Here. Would you
care for a refill?

53
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,166
Oh, sure, that'd be awesome.

54
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:01,625
This is delicious! And it pairs
with the saké perfectly.

55
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:05,750
Thank you so much, I've been
simmering it all afternoon.

56
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,000
Would you like to try a
different type of saké?

57
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,250
[NAKANO]
Yeah, lay it on me!

58
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,208
Give that a try.

59
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,166
Bottoms up!

60
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,625
Tastes like rice!

61
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,583
It even has the same
aroma as rice!

62
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,291
[SENKO laughs]

63
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,291
[NAKANO]
"The Fox's Cherry Blossoms"?

64
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,500
That's right.

65
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,708
The cherry blossoms
should be blooming soon,

66
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,791
so it seemed fitting.

67
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:35,541
When that happens, maybe you and
I could have a viewing party.

68
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:36,791
Yeah, sounds nice.

69
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,125
It's been quite a while
since I've done that.

70
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,791
Last year at work,
we had a deadline.

71
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,375
And of course you weren't here.

72
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,041
That's true.

73
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,125
[NAKANO]
When I was little,

74
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:53,333
I looked forward to doing
it every single year.

75
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,458
Yes, I'm sure you did.

76
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,333
[NAKANO]
Hm?

77
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:05,458
[SENKO laughs]

78
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,375
This particular saké tastes
better when you eat it

79
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:14,083
with cooked fish.
Why don't you try it out?

80
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,041
[gasps] I can't believe I get
to eat traditional food

81
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:20,208
like this in my own home!
You never cease to amaze me.

82
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,791
Really?

83
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,833
Then you'll be pleased to know
I also made some inari zushi!

84
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,291
Yum!

85
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,333
[SENKO giggles]

86
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,666
[NAKANO sighs] Can I have
one more drink, please?

87
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,291
[SENKO]
There's no need to stop there.

88
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,416
Drink all you like!

89
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,916
[NAKANO chuckles]
Okay! If you insist!

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,666
Huh? This looks pretty good.

91
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,958
Did you make this
plum wine, Senko?

92
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,541
[SENKO]
Uh-huh.

93
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,000
It's one of my favorite things
to do during the rainy season!

94
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,333
Ooh!

95
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:54,041
The plums taste so sweet,
kind of like a dessert!

96
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:57,125
It tastes super delicious.

97
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:02,791
Hey, whaddya call dis
fruit in it? Ah, uh.

98
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,125
Do you mean the plum?

99
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,791
You literally just said it
not even a minute ago.

100
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,125
[laughs] Right, thassit!

101
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,916
A plum. What a funny word.

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,666
[SENKO]
Uhh...

103
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,791
Oh my, I didn't think you
would get drunk so quickly.

104
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,375
It might be best if
you had some water.

105
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,208
Yeah, good idea.

106
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,666
Okay-- Uh.

107
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,208
[gasps] It's all right.

108
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,166
I've got it, so you
just stay put.

109
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,916
Sorry I'm so clumsy.

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,291
Did any of it spill
onto your clothes?

111
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:41,291
[NAKANO]
Please, I'm help-y to hap you.

112
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,041
[SENKO] I don't think your
business card will help here.

113
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:49,375
[gasps] I really am a giant
ball of useless, aren't I?

114
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,291
I shouldn't even be alive.

115
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,791
Don't be ridiculous.

116
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,041
But...

117
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,750
You're all over
the place tonight.

118
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:06,708
[NAKANO]
Today was kind of a disaster.

119
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,750
We were s'posed to
deliver the product,

120
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,291
but then the client
started making

121
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,416
all these new requests that
weren't in the original specs.

122
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,291
They even said that it
should have been obvious

123
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,833
from the beginning.

124
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,708
I tried talking to
my boss about it,

125
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,125
but he said, "the customer
is always right"

126
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:25,625
and that I had to do whatever
it took to get the job done.

127
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,833
I worked overtime for free
and still got in trouble.

128
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:32,625
It sucked. Like, what else does
the company want from me?

129
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:36,375
My goodness, that all
sounds rather frustrating.

130
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,083
Uh. No, I'm sorry.

131
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:41,000
My stupid problems must
be boring to hear about.

132
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,875
It's fine.

133
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,166
I feel terrible.

134
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,666
Complaining about work so much.

135
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,291
There are folks who have it
worse; I should be grateful.

136
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,708
Just because others
may have it worse,

137
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,708
doesn't mean your feelings
are any less valid.

138
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,333
What's more...

139
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:09,375
All I want is for you to share
those feelings with me.

140
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,625
[NAKANO gasps]

141
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:15,083
And I want to know everything
about you, the good and the bad.

142
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,708
If it's just the two of us here,
then there's no need to worry

143
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,250
about what other
people might think.

144
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,708
You can be yourself.

145
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,875
There's no need to
hold anything back.

146
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:30,458
Today was hard, and that's okay.

147
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:36,916
I'm sorry it was bad.
You must be very frustrated.

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,208
[NAKANO]
Yeah.

149
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:42,500
[SENKO]
But you still did a good job.

150
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:46,541
[NAKANO cries]
Yeah.

151
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,875
[NAKANO]
Senko...

152
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,375
Yes? What is it?

153
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,208
[NAKANO sighs]

154
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,333
Uh, hey! What are you doing?

155
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,916
[sighs] The little scamp
passed out on me.

156
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,125
He is kind of cute though.

157
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:25,625
[SENKO] I don't understand.
Why does it keep getting bigger?

158
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:32,166
[NAKANO] "The Fox's Cherry
Blossoms" is the good stuff.

159
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,833
Oh, no! How gross, I think
he's drooling on my tail!

160
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:40,416
[exhales] Now I have to
move him to the futon.

161
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:45,791
[SHIRO] Jeez! It's been
a whole year already!

Just how long is Nakano
gonna hog Sen for?

163

A year, huh?

The time went by
faster than I thought.

165

Ugh! At this rate I'll never get
to eat Sen's cooking again,

166
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,791
this whole thing is so unfair!

Oh, but that seems
like an odd complaint.

Well, yeah.

eat it here, not there!

[SORA laughs]
I understand.

But in any case, I doubt you

I suspect your wishes may be
granted sooner than you think.

Perhaps you only need be
a bit more patient, Shiro.

00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,166

we're trying to hit all these

That's what I mean.

I got chewed out for having
too much paid leave.

00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,500
Now I have to take it even
though the timing sucks.

191
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,583
[SENKO]
So, your break starts tomorrow?

192
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,166
Sure does.

193

That is truly wonderful to hear!
You've been working hard lately.

I'm sure that you
must be exhausted.

195

It makes me glad that
you're finally taking a break.

196
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,500
Self-care is very important!

197
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,375
[NAKANO] Since I've got some
time off, I thought maybe

198
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,125
we could take a trip
somewhere fun together.

199
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,375
Okay! Oh, this would be my first

time going someplace
special with you!

201
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,708
Hey, don't forget about that
mystic beach or whatever.

202
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,458
And the supermarket!

203
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,375
Uh yeah, I'm pretty sure
I wouldn't count that

204
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,083
as a fun trip.

205
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,708
Hey, Senko. If you could pick,
where would we visit?

206
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,000
[SENKO]
Me?

207
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,125
Perhaps the supermarket
in the next town over?

You're serious, aren't you?

209
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,041
Of course, Koenji
recommended it to me.

210
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,500
She said they have
excellent fried tofu.

211
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,875
Right, as you wish.

212
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,166
If you want, we can
go there tomorrow.

213
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,916
Sounds good!

214

Also. I know it's still
a bit early, but...

216
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,625
You knew?

217
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,208
[NAKANO] You mentioned it just
the other night, remember?

218
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,333
[SENKO] Yes, but you were
rather drunk at the time,

219
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,750
so to be honest, I sort
of thought you wouldn't.

220
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,250
Well, I definitely
remember that part,

221
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,666
but anything after that is
an entirely different story.

222
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,000
[SENKO laughs] At least you
can be honest about it.

223
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,208
Right. Would you like
to celebrate the start

224
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,333
of your much-needed
vacation, then?

225
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:46,750
Senko's bar is back open!
Would you care for a drink?

[NAKANO]
Uh... Sure thing!

I'm so sorry to
wake you up, dear.

232
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,791
[NAKANO]
Mom? Is something wrong?

233
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,916
[NAKANO'S MOM]
I'm sorry, dear. Your father

234
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,250
was just taken to the hospital.

235
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,500
[NAKANO]
What?

236
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,083
[NAKANO'S MOM]
I'm pretty sure he'll be fine.

237
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,791
But I still felt like I should
call and let you know.

238
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,625
[NAKANO]
Okay. Thank you.

239
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,625
[NAKANO]
That reminds me...

240
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:34,083
Otherwise, I fear something
bad may happen to you.

241
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,708
So I hope that
you'll be careful.

242
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,541
[NAKANO]
Something bad, huh?

243
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,000
That's crazy. No way.

244
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,791
Maybe you should go to see him.

245
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:45,958
You think?

246
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,333
It has been quite some time

247
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,291
since you've returned
home, right?

248
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,541
Yeah, that's true.
At least a few years.

249
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,500
I think this is the perfect
way to use your time off.

250
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:59,083
And besides, seeing their faces
might be good for all of you.

[NAKANO]
Uh... Maybe it would.

252
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,333
Wait, but I already
promised I would take you

253
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,208
to the supermarket in
the next town over today.

254
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:12,583
I suppose you'll have to
take me another time then.

255
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:16,708
The supermarket's not
going to disappear.

You're right.

Are you sure that you'll
be okay here by yourself?

by myself lots of times.

Oh good, I'm happy to hear it.

319
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,583
Are you going somewhere?

320
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:30,833
Uh! Yes, just for a bit.

321
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,083
Did something happen?

322
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:36,041
[SENKO]
Mm-mm. It's going to rain.

323
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,458
So it'd probably
be smart for you

324
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,791
to go ahead and bring
your laundry in.

325
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,958
[KOENJI]
Hm? Uh. It is?

326
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,500
[SENKO]
Farewell!

327
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,958
I'll see you later! Bye!

328
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,000
--[KOENJI laughs]

329
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,541
It's raining?

330
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,125
Whoa. Amazing.

331
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,916
The weather report said
it would be sunny.

332
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,708
Uh... Ah! My laundry!

333
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,083
[NAKANO]
Mom, I'm gonna take a walk!

334
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,500
[NAKANO'S MOM]
Have a good time, sweetie!

335
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,541
[NAKANO]
Mm?

336
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,666
Hey, Grandma. I'm home.

337
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,458
[gasps]

338
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,041
Plum blossoms?

339
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,583
[NAKANO gasps]

340
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,166
[NAKANO gasping]

[NAKANO gasping]

342
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:09,000
[NAKANO]
Back then... It was Senko.

343
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,250
[CAT meows]

344
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,875
[footsteps]

345
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,291
[NAKANO] If that really
was my ancestor...

346
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,458
[SENKO] I'll still be
with you. I promise, kay?

347
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,750
I'll always watch over you.

348
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:30,458
[NAKANO]
Senko. She was there.

349
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,125
Always.

350
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,041
[phone ringing]

351
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,458
That's weird.

352
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:24,083
[SORA]
Super Sora Time.

353
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,416
[SORA]
Welcome home.

354
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,833
I have been awaiting
your return.

355
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:36,000
It would appear you have had
another hard day of labor.

356
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,750
Unfortunately, Sen is
not available today.

357
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:42,333
But I am a demigod fox who has
lived for thousands of years.

358
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:48,041
So perhaps, I, Lady Sora,
could be of service to you.

359
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,625
Please, help yourself.

360
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:55,125
I sincerely hope that you will
find the taste to your liking.

361
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:58,875
[SORA laughs]
What's the matter?

362
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:02,375
I should inform you that I
did not prepare this meal.

363
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,875
In fact, this was
all Sen's doing.

364
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:06,250
Don't be wasteful.

365
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:09,958
Now. Allow me to feed you.

366
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:13,708
Oh? Are you not hungry?

367
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:16,583
I see, you're too lustful,
so you cannot eat.

368
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:20,916
Pardon. You said you're too
stuffed full, my mistake.

369
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,083
[laughs]

370
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,083
But if that's the case...

371
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:27,958
Well then, you must
be feeling tired.

372
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:30,625
Would you like to go to bed?

373
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,500
[SORA]
My goodness.

374
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:38,625
I did not think you would
actually want to go to sleep.

375
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,666
You really are
quite the scoundrel.

376
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,333
Goodnight and sweet dreams.
