1
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,650
[NAKANO, SENKO]
Thank you for the food.

2
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:23,275
Hold on. Leave those there
and I'll take care of them.

3
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:27,067
[NAKANO] Hey, let me help you
out a little. I've got it.

4
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:29,567
[NAKANO groans]

5
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:35,067
What's wrong. Are you okay?

6
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:41,733
[NAKANO] Well, I had to move
some heavy stuff at work today,

7
00:00:41,817 --> 00:00:44,150
and my back's been
messed up ever since.

8
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:46,650
[SENKO]
Oh dear, you poor thing!

9
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:50,025
Working at a desk all day
certainly has its drawbacks.

10
00:00:50,108 --> 00:00:54,150
Sounds like a rough day.
Plus, you need more exercise.

11
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:56,358
All right. Let's do it!

12
00:00:56,442 --> 00:00:58,025
[NAKANO]
Do what?

13
00:00:58,108 --> 00:01:00,942
We're gonna loosen up
that stiff back of yours!

14
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:06,900
[SENKO]
Come here and lie down.

15
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,108
Huh?

16
00:01:10,817 --> 00:01:12,317
[NAKANO]
Uhh...

17
00:01:14,067 --> 00:01:16,358
I would be happy to step on you.

18
00:01:16,442 --> 00:01:18,108
Okay, thank you.

19
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,108
Uhh...

20
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:23,733
[NAKANO]
Uhh...

21
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,108
Step on?!

22
00:02:59,192 --> 00:03:00,275
Step on?

23
00:03:00,358 --> 00:03:01,525
Uh-huh!

24
00:03:01,608 --> 00:03:03,275
Hang on, so you're not
gonna use your hands?

25
00:03:03,358 --> 00:03:06,108
Just my feet!
Trust me on this one.

26
00:03:06,192 --> 00:03:07,900
My body weight will be perfect!

27
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:08,983
[NAKANO]
Mmm...

28
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:14,317
Come on now, dear. You always
push yourself so hard.

29
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,233
Besides, aren't you into
this sort of thing?

30
00:03:17,317 --> 00:03:18,442
Tee-hee!

31
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:21,775
No, no, no! No way I
like that kinky stuff!

32
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:23,608
Is that what you
really think of me?

33
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:24,775
[SENKO]
Uhh...

34
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:35,442
Well, I suppose everyone has
their own unique tastes.

35
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:37,192
Stop making it weird!

36
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:39,983
Okay, enough joking.
I'll use my hands.

37
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:42,442
Would that suit
your tastes better?

38
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:46,567
I can't seem to catch a break
with you tonight, can I?

39
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,692
[SENKO]
Just try and relax.

40
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:51,942
You are in very capable hands.

41
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:54,400
I'm going to take
excellent care of you.

42
00:03:54,483 --> 00:03:57,900
If you insist. A massage
does sound pretty great.

43
00:03:57,983 --> 00:03:59,192
Okay!

44
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,275
All right. I'll get started.

45
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:06,817
[NAKANO]
Go for it.

46
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,358
Oh, boy.

47
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,483
[SENKO] How does that feel--is
it the right amount of pressure?

48
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:19,650
[NAKANO]
Yeah.

49
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:21,025
[SENKO]
Good.

50
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:26,983
[NAKANO]
Her hands are so warm,

51
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:31,358
and even though they're small,
they feel wonderful.

52
00:04:31,442 --> 00:04:34,900
She's so gentle,
but somehow strong.

53
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,733
I can feel my back
muscles relaxing.

54
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:46,400
[NAKANO]
This is pure heaven!

55
00:04:46,483 --> 00:04:48,317
[SENKO]
Is this helping?

56
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
[NAKANO]
Yes, very much.

57
00:04:50,483 --> 00:04:51,983
Oh, hey.

58
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:54,817
Is it possible for you to push
down a little bit harder, maybe?

59
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,192
Well, uh. It's actually
kind of difficult.

60
00:04:58,275 --> 00:05:01,983
You see, this position makes
it hard to use more pressure.

61
00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:07,900
[NAKANO]
Fine, you win...

62
00:05:07,983 --> 00:05:09,442
Senko?

63
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:15,650
[NAKANO]
Will you please step on me?

64
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:20,067
My pleasure! It's much
easier when you give in.

65
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,525
Here goes. And don't worry,
I promise to be gentle.

66
00:05:26,483 --> 00:05:27,858
[gasps]

67
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:34,983
[NAKANO]
Unbelievable.

68
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:43,233
[NAKANO] She's neither too
heavy, nor too light.

69
00:05:43,317 --> 00:05:46,900
And she shifts her
weight so seamlessly.

70
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,608
[NAKANO] She's hitting every
sore spot perfectly.

71
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,733
It feels amazing.

72
00:06:00,817 --> 00:06:03,650
I could get used to this.

73
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:06,733
Heck, I could get
addicted to this!

74
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:09,692
[NAKANO]
Right there.

75
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:11,067
Does this work?

76
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,525
Oh! Yes, thank you!

77
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:26,400
Aw, man. That's exactly
what I needed.

78
00:06:26,483 --> 00:06:29,608
And my body feels like a
million times lighter now.

79
00:06:29,692 --> 00:06:32,275
[SENKO laughs] Well good,
I'm happy to hear it.

80
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,858
I liked the sounds you made
during your massage.

81
00:06:34,942 --> 00:06:36,233
They were so cute!

82
00:06:36,317 --> 00:06:37,567
Uh!

83
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,567
[NAKANO] Quick, find a way
to change the subject!

84
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,108
[NAKANO]
Hey, you know what?

85
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:44,525
What if I gave you
a massage, Senko?

86
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:47,067
[SENKO]
Ooh, that sounds fabulous!

87
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,317
[grunts]

88
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
I have been feeling
a little sore lately.

89
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:51,733
Thank you so much!

90
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:54,233
Fair warning, I'm a
bit of an amateur.

91
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:57,608
Don't fret! Every master
starts that way.

92
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,650
[NAKANO]
Right, here I go.

93
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:00,775
[SENKO]
'Kay.

94
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:08,775
[NAKANO]
Man, my hands cover the entirety

95
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:11,775
of her adorable, tiny back.

96
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:15,525
I guess you can get muscle pain
no matter how small you are.

97
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:16,733
[gasps]

98
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:19,108
[NAKANO]
Hm?

99
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:22,608
[grunts]

100
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:26,525
[NAKANO] Whoa. That sounded like
an old person's dying breath!

101
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:28,983
Then again, she is over 800.

102
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:31,483
Oh, wow. You're pretty
good at this.

103
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:35,150
Thanks, I'm trying, anyway.

104
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:36,900
[gasps]

105
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:38,067
[NAKANO gasps]

106
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,525
[SENKO groans]
Not there!

107
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:48,233
[SENKO] I'd prefer you
not massage the part

108
00:07:48,317 --> 00:07:50,108
around the base of my tail.

109
00:07:50,192 --> 00:07:53,108
Right! I'm so sorry.

110
00:07:53,192 --> 00:07:55,650
[NAKANO]
Can you die from embarrassment?

111
00:07:57,275 --> 00:07:59,983
[SENKO yawns]

112
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:02,525
[SENKO] Wow, I can see what
you mean about your body

113
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:05,150
feeling lighter.
I appreciate it!

114
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:07,692
Sure.

115
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:08,858
[laughs]

116
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:11,525
What's wrong?
Is something funny to you?

117
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:14,733
Uh-huh. You were saying
how cute I sounded,

118
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:17,650
but mine don't compare to
the noises that you made.

119
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:18,983
Pardon?

120
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:26,150
Oh, but we could compare them.
You make some good ones.

121
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:28,108
Especially when you're laughing!

122
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:30,317
What?

123
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,650
Hold on! Wait!

124
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:33,900
What are you doing?

125
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:35,483
[SENKO] Tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle!

126
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:36,567
Tickle, tickle, tickle...

127
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,608
[NAKANO]
Stop! Are you serious right now?

128
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:40,733
[NAKANO, SENKO laughing]

129
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:56,442
[SHIRO] Goodness. That boy makes
some of the silliest faces.

130
00:08:56,525 --> 00:08:58,733
I wonder if he knows?

131
00:09:11,608 --> 00:09:12,942
[NAKANO'S ANCESTOR]
Inari sushi?

132
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:15,900
Uh-huh! It's my first
time ever making it.

133
00:09:15,983 --> 00:09:18,192
Would you like some, Master?

134
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:19,608
You sure?

135
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,025
Yes, of course!

136
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:24,067
[NAKANO'S ANCESTOR]
Right, thank you so much.

137
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,608
[SENKO]
You're welcome!

138
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:27,608
[chewing]

139
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,317
[NAKANO'S ANCESTOR]
My, this is delicious!

140
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,608
[SENKO]
Thank you!

141
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:38,442
[SENKO sighs]

142
00:09:42,942 --> 00:09:44,483
[NAKANO gasps]

143
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:48,608
[NAKANO]
Uh.

144
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,067
[NAKANO]
A dream?

145
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:57,025
I feel like I had another one
similar to that not long ago.

146
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:01,733
Good morning, sleepy head.

147
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:04,942
Uh? Oh my, you're up
earlier than usual.

148
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,692
Well, in that case, I'll go
whip you up some breakfast.

149
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:13,942
Thank you.

150
00:10:14,858 --> 00:10:16,150
[door clicks]

151
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:17,442
[laughs]

152
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,067
So, I was thinking about
making that wasabi inari

153
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,150
that you like so much
for dinner tonight.

154
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:26,775
Oh, that would be amazing!

155
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:28,150
Okay!

156
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:31,275
[KOENJI]
Uh.

157
00:10:31,358 --> 00:10:32,525
[NAKANO]
Mornin', Koenji.

158
00:10:32,608 --> 00:10:34,108
Hey, good morning.

159
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:35,442
[SENKO]
Good morning!

160
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:38,567
I'm glad to see you
taking out your trash.

161
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,192
Yep, I'm on it!

162
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:42,483
[KOENJI grunts]
There!

163
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:43,650
Great job!

164
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:46,275
Bye, have a good day at work!

165
00:10:46,358 --> 00:10:47,983
[KOENJI]
Take care out there!

166
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:49,650
Yeah, see ya!

167
00:10:53,358 --> 00:10:54,858
You know what,
Nakano seems like

168
00:10:54,942 --> 00:10:57,067
he's in much better
spirits these days,

169
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,358
but sometimes he still
looks so worn out.

170
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:01,733
His work must be
super tough, huh?

171
00:11:01,817 --> 00:11:03,775
Yes, perhaps. But then again,

172
00:11:03,858 --> 00:11:07,025
I've noticed that he often
looks very happy, as well.

173
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:09,567
[laughs] In fact, now
that I think about it,

174
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:14,192
he seemed especially happy when
I stepped on him the other day.

175
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:16,150
Say what?

176
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:17,442
[SENKO]
Still though.

177
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:20,400
I truly hope that he
continues to feel better.

178
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,150
Hey, man!

179
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:32,275
Oh wow, you have great timing.

180
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,317
I was just about to
finish this thing up.

181
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,817
Yeah, about that.

182
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,983
I'm so sorry, but the team
requested a revision.

183
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:40,400
Huh?

184
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:43,108
Get this, now we have to
start the project all over!

185
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:45,067
Will you help us?

186
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,275
Again?

187
00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:47,400
I'm begging you!

H-Hey! Mitaka!

Sorry, sir! Be right there!

Okay, fine.

Thank you for choosing

00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,442
NR East Japan Kurosu Station
for your transportation needs.

196

At this time, the final train
has departed for all lines.

197
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,650
Please remember that...

198
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:33,150
Aw, man. I missed
the last train.

[NAKANO]
I'm really sorry, Senko.

200

But I'm gonna have to stay
the night at the office.

[SHIRO]
Greetings, mortal! Hi there.

202
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:50,858
I, the great Shiro, have
come to escort you!

203
00:12:50,942 --> 00:12:53,650
Wait, hold on.
Why are you here?

204
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:55,733
It's a little late at night
to be out here alone

dressed like that.

206

Aw, jeez. Here you go.
At least put this on.

207
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:06,400
Fine. You worry far too much.

208
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:09,650
Why, I'll have you know that
being stealthy is my specialty.

209
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:11,983
In fact, I doubt
anyone has seen me.

210
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:13,858

[NAKANO]
You think?

213
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,525
It doesn't matter.

214
00:13:19,608 --> 00:13:22,067
More importantly, you
can't get home, can you?

215
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,692
Tell me the truth.

216
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:26,692
Yeah. It's kind of embarrassing.

217
00:13:26,775 --> 00:13:28,567
[SHIRO]
Well, it shall be all right.

218
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,775
I can send you
straight back home.

219
00:13:30,858 --> 00:13:33,108
Using my powers, of course!

220
00:13:35,025 --> 00:13:37,692
Whoa! You really have a
power that can do that?

221
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,567
[SHIRO]
Hmph. Absolutely!

222
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,067
Never underestimate
the power of a demigod!

223
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,983
Yes, ma'am.

224
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:45,775
Besides, if you don't
make it home tonight,

225
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,067
then I'm sure Sen will be upset.

226
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,233
[NAKANO]
Uh.

227
00:13:49,317 --> 00:13:50,067
[SHIRO]
However!

228
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,317
[NAKANO]
Huh?

229
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,942
Seeing as you will be benefiting
from my demigod fox powers,

230
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:58,733
you will have to give me
an offering in return.

231
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:00,608
A small tribute.

Thank you.

00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:19,442
That work?

235
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,025
So this is a "corn dog"?
I'm so excited!

236
00:14:27,192 --> 00:14:29,608
Yummy!

00:14:29,692 --> 00:14:32,358
Are you sure a corn dog
is all you want as tribute?

00:14:32,442 --> 00:14:36,192
It's perfect! Absolutely
delicious in every way!

Just in case, I got you
these things, too.

My, aren't you
the thoughtful one?

Ow, wow! It's so cold
and refreshing!

Uh. You might take
that one slowly.

[NAKANO] You know, I almost
bought some inari, too.

247
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:13,400

is way better than that, though.

[NAKANO]
True. Convenience store inari

249
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,775
could never compare
to Senko's cooking.

Are you ready to get going?

Yeah, sure thing.

But what's your plan
for getting us home?

My plan?

254
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:34,525
[NAKANO] Like, are we
gonna fly or something?

255
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:37,900
[SHIRO laughs]
That's not a terrible idea,

256
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,233
but it is a bit conspicuous.

257
00:15:40,317 --> 00:15:42,942
[NAKANO]
So, how then?

258
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:03,608
We take a little shortcut.

Follow me, Nakano.

You're not far off,

00:16:25,858 --> 00:16:28,067
I used the tori gates
to make a shortcut.

Man, your demigod powers
are really incredible.

I wish I could take
this route every day.

Uh-huh?

Seeing how Sen is a demigod fox,

00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:51,942
don't you ever wonder why she
does all this stuff for you?

Well, I...

276
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:56,317
I simply couldn't stand to
see you looking so worn down,

277
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,692
so I decided to help you!

Have you ever heard anything
about your ancestor, Nakano?

My ancestor? Uh-uh.

00:17:13,525 --> 00:17:17,817
[NAKANO] Wait, in my dream--was
that my ancestor with Senko?

283
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,275
[SHIRO]
And if it was? Then what?

284
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:27,067
Maybe Sen's just using you as a
replacement for your ancestor.

285
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,483
Maybe she's not thinking
about you at all.

Are you really
all right with that?

I mean, what choice do I have?

289
00:17:40,608 --> 00:17:42,108
My life is a train wreck.

290
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:43,858
She's always taking
great care of me

291
00:17:43,942 --> 00:17:46,150
and I can't do
anything in return.

292
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,275
So I can't blame her if she'd
rather think about my ancestor.

293
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:51,650
Whoa, now! There's no
need to be so negative!

294

[SHIRO]
Huh?

If that's what Senko needs,
I'm okay with it.

299
00:18:04,442 --> 00:18:06,733
The reason why doesn't
matter to me.

300
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:09,942
Because I'm just really happy to
have her in my life, you know?

301
00:18:10,025 --> 00:18:13,525
And for what it's worth, I feel
like Senko's happy, too.

302
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:17,567

I think she must be.

If you turned out
to be a bad guy,

I was gonna leave you
up here in the mountains.

The mountains?!

Well, it would appear
that you are good for more

of the way by yourself!

320
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,275
Huh? Hang on!

321
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:07,858
Where are we? The mountains?

322
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:09,650
It's your neighborhood.

323
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:15,692
It sure is.

324
00:19:18,442 --> 00:19:19,650
I'm home.

325
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:21,150
[footsteps]

326
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:23,692
Oh, how I've missed you!

327
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,233
Whoa, there!

328
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:27,692
I was starting to worry you
wouldn't make it home tonight.

329
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:30,067
Yeah, I'm sorry
about that, Senko.

330
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,608
[gasps] Is something
wrong, dear?

331
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:35,025
Uh, no.

332
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:37,942
[SENKO]
Eep!

333
00:19:39,483 --> 00:19:43,733
A nice tail fluffing always
helps me relax after a long day.

334
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:45,567
[SENKO]
My goodness.

335
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,483
Hm? Wait a moment.

336
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:50,608
What have you done
with your suit jacket?

337
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:53,400
[sniffs] That's odd.

338
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,983
I can't help but notice
you smell like another fox.

339
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:58,733
Uh-huh. I ran into
Shiro earlier.

340
00:19:58,817 --> 00:20:01,900
I let her wear it and the little
scamp never gave it back.

341
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:02,775
[SENKO]
Shiro?

342
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:04,025
[gasps]

343
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:06,067
See, I accidentally
missed the last train,

344
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,900
but Shiro offered
to bring me home.

345
00:20:07,983 --> 00:20:10,900
[SENKO sniffles]

346
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:13,650
You spent the night
with another fox?

347
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:18,275
Aw, don't cry!
You're the only fox for me!

348
00:20:18,358 --> 00:20:19,858
I'm teasing.

349
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:21,900
Though I bet you at least
ate some yummy snacks

350
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:23,483
in the city, didn't you?

351
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,233
Well yes, that I am guilty of.

352
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:28,192
[gasps] And considering I
thought you weren't coming home.

353
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:29,567
I had no choice but to eat

354
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,608
the wasabi inari
that I made for you.

355
00:20:31,692 --> 00:20:36,192
[sighs] I really wanted to
eat those, but that's fair.

356
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:38,025
Nah, I'm still just teasing.

357
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:40,233
Would you like to eat some now?

358
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,692
Yes!

359
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:47,067
In fact, I've been looking
forward to it all day.

360
00:22:21,025 --> 00:22:23,192
[SENKO]
Super Senko Time!

361
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,900
Hello, welcome back!

362
00:22:26,983 --> 00:22:29,275
You're home a bit early today.

363
00:22:29,358 --> 00:22:31,900
Oh my, the breeze out
here is quite lovely.

364
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:34,442
Would you care to go for
an evening stroll with me?

365
00:22:37,317 --> 00:22:41,192
[SENKO sighs]
What a magnificent sunset!

366
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:43,483
And getting to see it with
someone I care about

367
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:45,358
makes it even more special.

368
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,317
Heh.

369
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,317
What's this? Oh, my!

370
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,983
You have a stray eyelash
stuck to your cheek.

371
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:57,358
Aw, there's no need to be shy.

372
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:00,067
Before I remove it, you
have to think really hard

373
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,983
and make a wish, okay?

374
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:03,442
Hasn't anyone ever told you

375
00:23:03,525 --> 00:23:05,775
if an eyelash falls out and
someone grabs it for you,

376
00:23:05,858 --> 00:23:07,567
then your wish will come true!

377
00:23:09,025 --> 00:23:10,692
Is it weird for
a demigod fox

378
00:23:10,775 --> 00:23:13,525
to believe in such
a silly superstition?

379
00:23:13,608 --> 00:23:16,942
Well, I think believing
is a powerful thing.

380
00:23:17,025 --> 00:23:18,525
If you don't hurry up
and make a wish,

381
00:23:18,608 --> 00:23:20,983
then the wind may
steal it from you!

382
00:23:22,817 --> 00:23:26,650
So does that mean
you've made one?

383
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:29,025
Okay! Way to go.

384
00:23:32,442 --> 00:23:34,525
I won't ask you
what you wished for,

385
00:23:34,608 --> 00:23:37,400
but I do hope that
it comes true.

386
00:23:40,358 --> 00:23:42,817
[SENKO] Thank you so much
for your hard work today.

387
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,108
Good night and sweet dreams.
