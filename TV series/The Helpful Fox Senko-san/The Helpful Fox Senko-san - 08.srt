1
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:17,483
[NAKANO] Finally!
Today I start summer break!

2
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:21,858
What wonderful news! How many
days of vacation do you get?

3
00:00:21,942 --> 00:00:24,108
[NAKANO]
Mm. Well, it's just one.

4
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:26,442
[SENKO]
Eep! That's unfortunate.

5
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:27,692
If only it were longer,

6
00:00:27,775 --> 00:00:30,858
we could have gone
somewhere for a few days.

7
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:34,358
I guess we'll just have
a staycation instead.

8
00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:35,692
Ah, well.

9
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:37,650
Not if I can help it!

10
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:38,650
Holy crap!

11
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:39,733
[SENKO]
Huh?

12
00:00:39,817 --> 00:00:41,900
[SHIRO]
Mm. There we go!

13
00:00:41,983 --> 00:00:43,442
[SHIRO laughs]

14
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:46,442
[SHIRO] Stop staring and pack
your things, already!

15
00:00:46,525 --> 00:00:49,233
[NAKANO] Uh, why?
Are we going somewhere?

16
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:51,192
Oh, you bet we are!

17
00:01:02,692 --> 00:01:05,025
[SHIRO]
The beach, baby!

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,067
[gasping]

19
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,692
Cool!

20
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,233
It's beautiful!

21
00:02:48,983 --> 00:02:52,900
[KOENJI] Amazing!
Holy wow, I can't believe

22
00:02:52,983 --> 00:02:57,275
there's a super-secret beach
so close to where we live!

23
00:02:57,358 --> 00:03:00,358
Thanks for bringing us, Shiro!
You're the bomb-dot-com!

24
00:03:00,442 --> 00:03:01,442
Yeah, thank you.

25
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:02,317
Of course!

26
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,942
[SENKO laughs]

27
00:03:04,025 --> 00:03:06,817
It is kind of weird that I don't
remember the trip, though.

28
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,858
[laughs]

29
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,400
[NAKANO] We can't exactly
tell her it's because she was

30
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:16,108
conked out when we
went through the gates.

31
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:19,650
Hey, Shiro? Was it a good
idea to bring Koenji?

32
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,942
Sure! Plus, it's like
they always say,

33
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:25,733
the more the merrier!
Not to mention...

34
00:03:25,817 --> 00:03:29,650
I wanted to share it.
Such a beautiful view.

35
00:03:31,817 --> 00:03:36,150
Not the ocean. I meant my
adorable swimsuit, of course!

36
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:38,650
--Ah...
--[NAKANO laughing]

37
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:41,400
[KOENJI gasping]
Oh-em-gee!

38
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:43,233
You're too much!

39
00:03:43,317 --> 00:03:44,608
[SENKO]
It is rather cute.

40
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,067
--[KOENJI] That's it! Perfect!
--[SHIRO] Right?

41
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,275
--You're a tiger. Grrr!
--Feel free to praise me more.

42
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:50,358
Well?

43
00:03:50,442 --> 00:03:52,025
[NAKANO]
Mm. Uh.

44
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:55,067
Oh, you have the most
beautiful fur in the world!

45
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,483
Yes. Of course I do!

46
00:03:57,567 --> 00:04:00,692
Right! Let's go out there
and have fun, Jasuko!

47
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:02,150
[KOENJI]
Yeah!

48
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:02,983
Who?

49
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:04,275
Jasuko?

50
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:07,942
[KOENJI] U-Uh. Uh, yeah,
that's my pen name.

51
00:04:08,025 --> 00:04:09,650
Yasuko plus Koenji.

52
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:12,442
It's the end of my last name
combined with my first name.

53
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:14,275
I get it.

54
00:04:14,358 --> 00:04:16,733
Come on, Jasuko,
I wanna go swimming!

55
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:18,775
Oh, be right there!

56
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,775
Uh... Ahh! Hot sand!

57
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:23,900
[BOTH laughing]

58
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:27,358
[SHIRO]
I'm first!

59
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,817
[laughing] I'm second!

60
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,483
It's freezing!

61
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:34,900
Ha! Attack!

62
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,442
[KOENJI laughing]
No fair, Shiro,

63
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:38,858
you could have at
least warned me!

64
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:41,525
That was the warning!

65
00:04:41,608 --> 00:04:42,817
Well, okay.

66
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,983
--Ha, I gotcha!
--[KOENJI] Take this!

67
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:46,608
Ah! My nose!

68
00:04:46,692 --> 00:04:47,483
[KOENJI laughing]

69
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:49,692
[SHIRO]
Eat this!

70
00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:51,400
Hey you knocked off my glasses!

71
00:04:51,483 --> 00:04:52,733
[laughing]

72
00:04:52,817 --> 00:04:54,025
Uh.

73
00:04:54,108 --> 00:04:56,483
[SHIRO]
Here!

74
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:58,108
Ah, that's much better!

75
00:04:58,192 --> 00:05:00,733
C'mon, let's go swimming, Jasko!

76
00:05:00,817 --> 00:05:01,775
Roger!

77
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:03,858
[GIRLS giggle]

78
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:05,150
[KOENJI]
Wait for me!

79
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:06,942
[KOENJI, SHIRO chattering]

80
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:08,942
Well. Looks like
they're having fun.

81
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:11,442
For sure. And watching
them feels relaxing.

82
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:12,692
Yeah.

83
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:13,858
Though I wonder,

84
00:05:13,942 --> 00:05:16,233
when did Shiro and
Koenji become friends?

85
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,733
[SENKO] Shiro's apparently taken
to hanging out with her.

86
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:20,525
They play video games and stuff.

87
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:22,150
[NAKANO]
Ah, makes sense.

88
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:29,442
[SENKO] Oh, I know.
Would you like some watermelon?

89
00:05:29,525 --> 00:05:30,608
[NAKANO]
Sure!

90
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:37,442
It's so cold and sweet!

91
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:39,942
I'm happy that
you're enjoying it.

92
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:42,650
And I'm sorry, I suppose
the day's a bit more hectic

93
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:44,400
with both Shiro and Koenji here.

94
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:46,192
Not at all.

95
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:49,150
Besides, if anything, we owe
Shiro for dragging us here.

96
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:50,442
Think about it.

97
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:52,442
We would have just
stayed home otherwise.

98
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:54,150
This is better.

99
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:57,608
In a way, I think this is her
kinda looking out for us.

100
00:05:57,692 --> 00:06:00,442
It's a nice change of pace
from the crowded city.

101
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:01,775
The fresh air is great,

102
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:04,317
and it just makes you
feel good, you know?

103
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,483
[SENKO]
Yes, I do.

104
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:07,650
[BOTH laughing]

105
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:09,317
[NAKANO] I get why
Shiro feels like she can

106
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,275
frolic around out here.

107
00:06:11,358 --> 00:06:12,483
[laughing]

108
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:15,233
Yeah, but she's like
that all the time.

109
00:06:15,317 --> 00:06:17,900
Are you planning
to frolic at all?

110
00:06:17,983 --> 00:06:20,567
Uhh... I don't know.

111
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,900
To be honest, I'm not
sure if I even know how

112
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,525
to play at the beach anymore.

113
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:27,483
I understand that feeling.

114
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:29,942
In fact, the only time
I've ever been in the ocean

115
00:06:30,025 --> 00:06:33,650
was to purify my body. I've
certainly never played in it.

116
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:35,650
Oh, I didn't know that.

117
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:37,400
Yep. Until today,

118
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:40,525
I've never even had the need
to wear a bathing suit.

119
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,150
[NAKANO]
Really? You look nice in it.

120
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:43,775
Do you mean it?

121
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:45,233
Sure do.

122
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,400
[NAKANO] Well, whether I'm
sitting here on the beach

123
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:52,067
or playing out in the ocean,

124
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,858
I know for sure I'd have fun
no matter what we do.

125
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:56,358
[SENKO]
Hm?

126
00:06:56,442 --> 00:06:58,608
[NAKANO] Because I've got a
cute, swim-suit wearing fox

127
00:06:58,692 --> 00:07:01,233
by my side to keep me company.

128
00:07:01,317 --> 00:07:03,067
Oh, you.

129
00:07:04,317 --> 00:07:05,275
[gasps]

130
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,733
Sorry! Throw it back
over here, Sen!

131
00:07:07,817 --> 00:07:10,442
Shall we go and join
them in their play?

132
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:14,108
Yeah. It would be good to get
up and move around a little bit.

133
00:07:16,358 --> 00:07:19,650
[KOENJI]
All right, get ready!

134
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:22,108
Take this!

135
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,275
[NAKANO]
Uh!

136
00:07:24,858 --> 00:07:26,108
It's mine!

137
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:28,358
Whoa!

138
00:07:28,442 --> 00:07:29,775
So high!

139
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:31,025
[SHIRO grunts]

140
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:32,650
[SENKO grunts]
It's all yours!

141
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:34,400
Uh, right!

142
00:07:35,858 --> 00:07:36,817
It's out!

143
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,275
We scored!

144
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:39,900
You know, I'm kinda surprised.

145
00:07:39,983 --> 00:07:43,233
I didn't realize you
two were so athletic.

146
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:44,900
Well duh, of course we are!

147
00:07:44,983 --> 00:07:47,983
You should never underestimate
a demigod fox!

148
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,192
I'm gonna serve now, okay?

149
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:52,525
Here goes!

150
00:07:53,442 --> 00:07:55,358
Get ready, and go!

151
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,567
Uh. Got it.

152
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,525
That was an excellent hit!

153
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:06,608
I guess it wasn't too bad.

154
00:08:06,692 --> 00:08:09,900
Truth is, I couldn't have done
it without your perfect set.

155
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,192
We won't let them win so easily.

156
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:13,442
Am I right?

157
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:14,983
It's on!

158
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:17,942
[SENKO]
Mine!

159
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:19,692
'Kay, Jasuko. Go!

160
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:21,192
All right!

161
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:25,275
I hope you're hungry, 'cause
you're about to get served!

162
00:08:25,358 --> 00:08:26,900
Better get ready, Senko!

163
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:28,108
Right!

164
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:30,025
[yelling]

165
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:31,317
[groans]

166
00:08:33,317 --> 00:08:36,150
[groaning]

167
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,733
[KOENJI whimpering]

168
00:08:47,858 --> 00:08:55,858
[laughs] You just got taken
out by a ball of air!

169
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:59,025
[KOENJI]
Uh... I see my lack of exercise

170
00:08:59,108 --> 00:09:00,733
has come back to haunt me.

171
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:02,983
You'll hit the next one, okay?

172
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:04,608
Roger, Captain!

173
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:08,067
All right, Senko. You ready?

174
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,608
Yep! [grunts]

175
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:12,233
I've got it!

176
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:20,900
[KOENJI]
Aw, man!

177
00:09:20,983 --> 00:09:22,525
I can't believe I missed it!

178
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:25,317
Just make sure you hit
the next one, okay, Shiro?

179
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,733
Shut up!

180
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,900
Let's do this!
Our comeback starts now!

181
00:09:29,983 --> 00:09:32,150
Oh, you know it does!

182
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:34,692
I have to say, they
make a pretty good team.

183
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,900
Perhaps. But we do, too!

184
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:39,275
Darn right!

185
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:57,400
[NAKANO sighs]

186
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,192
[NAKANO]
This is awesome!

187
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,233
It looks like the
score's tied up.

188
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,858
All right. Don't hold back, Sen!

189
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:13,442
As you wish!

190
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,067
[KOENJI]
Take this!

191
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,025
[SENKO]
Over here!

192
00:10:16,108 --> 00:10:17,150
Right!

193
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:28,108
[NAKANO]
Is she a fox or a meteor?

194
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:32,192
Her power level...
It's gotta be over 9,000!

195
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:36,025
Ahh! My back!

196
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:44,692
Ow. I think I pulled something.

197
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:46,067
[BOTH]
Huh?

198
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,108
I guess we took the
frolicking thing too far.

199
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:55,942
Yes, perhaps I also
need more exercise.

200
00:10:56,025 --> 00:10:57,567
I hear that.

201
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:02,358
[SENKO] We probably should
have stretched first.

202
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:03,817
[NAKANO]
Probably.

203
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:16,567
It's all finished!

204
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:20,983
[KOENJI] I call this piece
"Little Yoko Goes to the Beach"!

205
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:23,983
Good job! I, the Great
Shiro, was happy to help!

206
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:26,233
What? But you didn't
do anything.

207
00:11:26,317 --> 00:11:27,733
I offered moral support!

208
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:28,817
Huh?

209
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,775
[SHIRO]
Whew! That was a lot of work!

210
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,442
[KOENJI]
I'm so wiped!

211
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,233
I'm just gonna take
a little nappy.

212
00:11:35,317 --> 00:11:36,067
[SENKO]
Hey!

213
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,108
[KOENJI, SHIRO]
Uh?

214
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:39,400
Are you ladies ready
for lunch, yet?

215
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:40,650
[SHIRO]
Yes, please!

216
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,442
I know, since we're
at the beach today,

217
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:45,483
can we have one of those
famous "barbecue" thingies?

218
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:48,442
What she said!
That sounds awesome to me!

219
00:11:48,525 --> 00:11:51,733
Yeah, but I kind of doubt we
have the supplies for that.

220
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,900
May I present... the barbecue!

221
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:00,650
You had that in a bag?

222
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,733
Indeed, I was trying
to escape reality

223
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:06,108
by doing a little retail
therapy online.

224
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,067
[KOENJI] Ugh, I'm done,
I'm done, I'm so done!

225
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,483
I wanna go to the beach,
screw manga!

226
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:15,650
Is this why it's
called a deadline?

227
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:17,525
[SHIRO]
Hey, Jasuko!

228
00:12:17,608 --> 00:12:20,108
I just so happen to know
of a secret beach.

229
00:12:20,192 --> 00:12:22,358
I can take you,
when you're finished.

230
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,150
For real? Thank you!

231
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:26,233
But only if you buy this for me.

232
00:12:26,317 --> 00:12:28,817
[KOENJI]
Consider it done!

233
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,692
Ooh, this looks super cute, too.

234
00:12:31,775 --> 00:12:33,567
[SHIRO] This device makes
shopping easy!

235
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,275
[gasping]

236
00:12:35,358 --> 00:12:36,692
Can I get these, too?

237
00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:39,525
Sure! We'll buy everything
beach related!

238
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:43,942
Aww, yeah. My body is ready!

239
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:48,775
And... There you have it!

240
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:50,942
[NAKANO]
Well, that solves that mystery.

241
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:53,358
The problem is I didn't
actually bring any food.

242
00:12:53,442 --> 00:12:55,150
[NAKANO] That's the most
important part!

243
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,108
We can just go and
catch our own food!

244
00:12:57,192 --> 00:12:58,650
I'm a natural predator!

245
00:12:58,733 --> 00:12:59,692
Heck yeah!

246
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,442
Wait. How, though?

247
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:03,442
[SHIRO]
We can use our bare hands!

248
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:05,025
Onward, Jasuko!

249
00:13:05,108 --> 00:13:07,233
[KOENJI]
Roger, Cap'n!

250
00:13:07,317 --> 00:13:08,983
I envy them.

251
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:10,567
Ah, to be young.

252
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,733
Anyway, would you please help
me with setting the grill up?

253
00:13:12,817 --> 00:13:14,025
Sure thing.

254
00:13:17,525 --> 00:13:19,192
There, all done!

255
00:13:19,275 --> 00:13:22,400
And thankfully we have your
cool foxfire to use as a flame,

256
00:13:22,483 --> 00:13:23,692
so we won't need a lighter.

257
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:24,692
[SENKO]
Indeed!

258
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:26,067
[NAKANO]
I'm gonna do some scouting

259
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,108
and see if there's anything
we can use for cooking.

260
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:30,733
All right. Please be
careful out there!

261
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:31,775
'Kay!

262
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:44,650
Huh?

263
00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:58,233
Excuse me? Are you guys open?

264
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,400
Anyone here?

265
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:08,317
[NAKANO] Is this some
kind of snack stand?

266
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,442
Maybe they have some utensils.

267
00:14:12,442 --> 00:14:15,525
[YOZORA] Hello young sir, you
seem to be having a fun day.

268
00:14:15,608 --> 00:14:16,775
[gasps]

269
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:23,608
[laughs]

270
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:25,025
What the...?

271
00:14:25,108 --> 00:14:27,442
[NAKANO]
How long has she been here?

272
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:29,358
I didn't even see her!

273
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:31,692
[NAKANO] Sorry, I didn't
mean to barge in.

274
00:14:31,775 --> 00:14:32,983
[YOZORA]
It's all right.

275
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:35,317
Though I must admit,
it's rather unusual

276
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,150
for us to get visitors
way out here.

277
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:43,275
I suppose I could always
pretend I didn't see you.

278
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:44,942
Okay, then.

279
00:14:46,108 --> 00:14:49,150
The items you are seeking
are right over there.

280
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:50,650
[NAKANO]
Huh?

281
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:54,108
[YOZORA] There are some
gifts from me, as well.

282
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:59,942
[NAKANO] Woah, no way.
This is for me to take?

283
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:04,400
I mean... That's very generous,
but I can't accept...

284
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:05,692
...it.

285
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:10,608
[NAKANO]
Huh?

286
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:16,192
Excuse me?

287
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:17,733
Hello, miss?

288
00:15:19,358 --> 00:15:20,900
She's gone.

289
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,525
[SENKO]
Oh, my!

290
00:15:26,608 --> 00:15:30,317
Where on earth did you manage to
find such an impressive platter?

291
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,275
[NAKANO] I got it from a
mysterious woman in a shack.

292
00:15:33,358 --> 00:15:36,525
But then she left before I
had the chance to refuse.

293
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:39,108
[SENKO]
Hm. That sounds a bit odd.

294
00:15:39,192 --> 00:15:40,733
Yeah, I was a little thrown off

295
00:15:40,817 --> 00:15:42,775
since I thought this
was a secret beach.

296
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,067
But I guess there are
other people around, huh?

297
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,442
[SENKO]
No.

298
00:15:46,525 --> 00:15:48,317
That would be quite impossible.

299
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,067
[NAKANO]
Huh?

300
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,233
[SENKO]
This land exists

301
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,650
somewhere between
our two worlds.

302
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:57,942
As such, a mere human
could not enter it easily.

303
00:15:58,025 --> 00:15:59,692
[gulps]

304
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:01,358
Which then begs the question.

305
00:16:01,442 --> 00:16:04,067
What sort of being
did you encounter?

306
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,692
Mm!

307
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,233
Look, if you're trying to scare
me, then it's totally working.

308
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:12,483
Is it?

309
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:14,483
You think you'd be used
to strange happenings

310
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,442
since you live with
a demigod fox.

311
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:18,483
[NAKANO chuckles]
Well, that's a fair point.

312
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:19,442
Yep.

313
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:21,192
[SHIRO]
Sen!

314
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:24,900
Check out what we found!
It's seaweed!

315
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:27,150
That's perfect! Thank you!

316
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:28,442
Seaweed?

317
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:31,233
Turns out fishing with
your hands is kinda hard.

318
00:16:31,317 --> 00:16:32,358
Who knew?

319
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:34,817
[NAKANO]
Seaweed probably moves less.

320
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,067
Hold on. What is this?

321
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,400
No way! Pinch me
'cause I'm dreaming!

322
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:43,233
Wow. Where'd you
find such a feast?

323
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:46,483
Apparently, it all came from
a mysterious shack nearby.

324
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,483
[KOENJI gasping]

325
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:51,275
Well, anyway. Now that
we have the food sorted,

326
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:53,692
shall we have the barbecue
thing you mentioned?

327
00:16:53,775 --> 00:16:55,275
[ALL]
Yeah!

328
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,900
It's so good! These
ingredients are top notch!

329
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,358
And eating them outside
makes them even tastier!

330
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:09,067
[KOENJI]
Right!

331
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,567
Don't worry, I'll load up
the grill while you guys eat.

332
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,108
Race ya to the shrimp! 'Kay?

333
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:14,150
Kay!

334
00:17:16,483 --> 00:17:17,483
[KOENJI]
Man!

335
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,733
And I win!

336
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:22,108
[gasping] Careful,
that's still hot!

337
00:17:22,192 --> 00:17:23,233
It burns!

338
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:24,567
[KOENJI]
The next shrimp will be mine!

339
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,775
[SHIRO] What? That's
not fair, my hand...

340
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:28,108
[SENKO]
Is something wrong?

341
00:17:28,192 --> 00:17:29,567
If you don't make a plate,

342
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,233
you'll miss out on all the
delicious meat and veggies.

343
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:39,442
[NAKANO]
Right. Load me up.

344
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,525
[SENKO]
'Kay!

345
00:17:40,608 --> 00:17:42,067
[KOENJI]
Oh, I took the last shrimp.

346
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,150
--[SENKO] Eep!
--[NAKANO] Huh?

347
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:44,608
[SHIRO]
But there's plenty of seaweed!

348
00:17:44,692 --> 00:17:46,067
[NAKANO]
I'll pass.

349
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:59,358
[BOTH laughing]

350
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:04,817
You know, today
was really great.

351
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,025
It was the perfect way
to spend my day off.

352
00:18:07,108 --> 00:18:08,608
It was nice.

353
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:12,817
I love how beautiful
the fireworks are.

354
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,733
It's been a while since
I last viewed them--

355
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:16,400
they're quite vibrant.

356
00:18:22,108 --> 00:18:24,358
And the weather's
just amazing out here.

357
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:27,817
A nice breeze to cool
you off and everything.

358
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,233
All you can hear is the
sound of the ocean waves

359
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:34,650
and the sparklers. It's like
the calm after a festival.

360
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:36,483
The quiet somehow
really helps me

361
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:38,733
appreciate all the
fun we had today.

362
00:18:43,025 --> 00:18:44,650
That's very true.

363
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,150
Still though, I can't help
but feel a little sad.

364
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:50,775
[SENKO]
Why's that?

365
00:18:50,858 --> 00:18:53,858
[NAKANO] Well, because it means
the fun day is over now.

366
00:18:58,983 --> 00:19:01,317
These fireworks will burn
out just like my soul

367
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,442
when it has to go back to my
lame old office job tomorrow.

368
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:05,650
I hate it.

369
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:08,692
[SENKO] If only you had
more time to relax.

370
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:15,942
I suppose all fun times
must come to an end, huh?

371
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:17,858
But that doesn't have to be

372
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:20,400
something you worry
about right now.

373
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:22,358
Uh?

374
00:19:22,442 --> 00:19:25,067
[SENKO] Everything has
to end eventually.

375
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:31,317
And while it's easy to be
sad about something ending,

376
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,442
there's no reason to let
yourself suffer because of it.

377
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:36,775
[NAKANO]
Huh?

378
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:44,775
I promise.

379
00:19:44,858 --> 00:19:47,567
I'll make you forget being sad!

380
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:52,942
After all, the future
is full of possibilities,

381
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,233
and there will be lots
of fun new days.

382
00:19:55,317 --> 00:19:57,025
[NAKANO]
Senko...

383
00:19:57,108 --> 00:20:00,942
[SENKO] Maybe we can set off
some really big fireworks!

384
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:04,275
And I'd like to go to a
summer festival, as well!

385
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:15,817
[NAKANO]
You're right.

386
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,317
That sounds good.

387
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,108
Whoa, check out these fireworks!

388
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:20,317
What kind are they?

389
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,525
It's fox-fire!

390
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:23,192
[KOENJI]
That's a pretty cool name!

391
00:20:23,275 --> 00:20:24,275
[SHIRO]
Duh!

392
00:20:28,108 --> 00:20:30,650
[NAKANO]
We should all come back.

393
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:31,858
Next year, maybe.

394
00:20:31,942 --> 00:20:33,483
[SENKO]
Agreed!

395
00:20:46,192 --> 00:20:47,525
[YOZORA]
Why, yes.

396
00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:50,525
Everything has to
end eventually.

397
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,192
[SENKO]
Super Senko Time!

398
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,525
I hope that I didn't
worry you too much today.

399
00:22:41,608 --> 00:22:43,775
I probably should have stretched
more before we started

400
00:22:43,858 --> 00:22:46,692
playing earlier,
but I'm fine now.

401
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,942
See, I injured my back
a long time ago.

402
00:22:51,025 --> 00:22:52,775
I should be more careful.

403
00:22:52,858 --> 00:22:56,525
It's never a good thing
to push yourself too hard.

404
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,275
Oh?

405
00:22:58,358 --> 00:23:01,525
Look at this beautiful shell
I just found in the sand!

406
00:23:01,608 --> 00:23:03,817
Here's a fun fact about shells.

407
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,150
If you place it by your ear,
then you can hear the sound

408
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:10,775
of the ocean no matter where
you may be in the world.

409
00:23:10,858 --> 00:23:13,275
Hear it?

410
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:15,608
Good! I'm so glad.

411
00:23:15,692 --> 00:23:17,525
Then again, it's probably
easy to hear the waves

412
00:23:17,608 --> 00:23:20,067
when you're sitting right
next to the ocean, huh?

413
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,983
I don't mean you should
listen to it here, though!

414
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:24,608
Uh...

415
00:23:24,692 --> 00:23:27,608
I mean, you should take it back
home and give it a listen.

416
00:23:27,692 --> 00:23:29,900
I'm sure you'll be able
to hear it then!

417
00:23:29,983 --> 00:23:35,108
And you'll be reminded of all
the fun memories we made!

418
00:23:35,192 --> 00:23:38,025
I had such a wonderful
time with you today.

419
00:23:38,108 --> 00:23:41,900
You must be very tired
from all the sun.

420
00:23:41,983 --> 00:23:44,692
Get some sleep and
have sweet dreams!
