00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,166
How's it goin' in there,
Senko, you almost ready?

315
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,208
[SENKO]
Uh. Almost.

316
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,500
[gasping]

317
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,458
[SENKO]
Am I wearing this right?

318
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,166
Yes! You're slaying!

319
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,458
Incredible! No, better
than incredible!

320
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,750
The perfect fox-maid combo!

321
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,083
Would you mind giving
me a little pose?

322
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,583
Uh, will this suffice?

323
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:54,083
[KOENJI]
Oh-em-gee, I'm dying!

324
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,333
[KOENJI screams]

325
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,833
Wow! That was amazing.

326
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,750
Well, I'm happy that
you enjoyed yourself.

327
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,708
[KOENJI]
You can keep the maid cosplay.

328
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:12,875
It's my gift to you.

329
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,875
Really, are you sure?

330
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,791
Totally, I don't
need it anymore.

331
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:20,958
You're always helping me out, so
this is my way of saying thanks.

332
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:27,458
[SENKO] In that case,
I promise I shall cherish it.

333
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,875
If my company really
pleases you that much,

334
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,458
then perhaps I'll
visit again soon.

335
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,083
Goodbye then.

336
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,291
[KOENJI]
Come by anytime.

337
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,750
Will do.

338
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,541
[door shuts]

339
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,416
[exhales]

340
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:55,291
Ah! Senko is so freakin'
cute it's not fair!

341
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,875
I hate you, Nakano!

342
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,250
If she wasn't your wife,
I would've been all over her!

343
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,250
My self-control is top notch!

344
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,083
Go me!

345
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,958
Aww, I'm insanely jealous.

346
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:10,041
I wish I had a cute
cosplayer wife, too.

347
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,958
[NAKANO]
I'm home.

348
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:14,833
Uh.

349
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:20,458
It is a pleasure to see
you again, dear Master.

350
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:21,708
[NAKANO gasping]

351
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,875
[SENKO]
Eep! Why did you run away?

352
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,125
[NAKANO]
Senko! They'll see you!

353
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,666
[SENKO]
But why did you go outside?

354
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,250
Well, you just kind of
took me by surprise is all.

355
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,791
So I needed a couple of
minutes to compose myself.

356
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,000
Wait, are you trying to say
that you do not approve

357
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,041
of my change of clothes?

358
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:46,000
No, I... Uh, it's not
that I don't like it,

359
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,375
if anything,
I think it suits you.

360
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,041
You look wonderful.

361
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,458
[sighs] Good, that
makes me very happy.

362
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,208
And actually, Koenji is the one
who gave me these clothes,

363
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,708
she said that every man
loves a girl in a maid outfit.

364
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,791
You are gonna blow his mind!

365
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:03,708
[NAKANO] For some reason,
I'm not surprised.

366
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,791
So, do I even wanna
know why our neighbor

367
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,833
has a maid outfit in your size?

368
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,333
She said it was reference
material for her manga.

369
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,375
Oh yeah, that's right,
I completely forgot

370
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,000
she works as a manga artist.

371
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,041
[SENKO]
Yep!

372
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,250
I wonder what kinda
manga she draws.

373
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,875
[SENKO] She showed me
some of it earlier,

374
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,708
and it appears to feature
quite a few maids.

375
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,125
[NAKANO]
That makes sense.

376
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,000
Here's an idea, though.

377
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,791
I think it'd be interesting to
see a bit of Japanese taste

378
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,833
mixed in, like a maid outfit
from the Taisho era.

379
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,458
Is that a fact?

380
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,958
Uh, I mean!
It's just a thought!

381
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,416
Right.

382
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,916
[NAKANO] Listen, while I am
glad that I got to see you

383
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,708
in a maid cosplay, I think I
prefer your normal clothes.

384
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:43,958
You do?

385
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,208
I mean...

386
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,458
How do I put this?

387
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:50,291
I guess it doesn't feel
much like home this way.

388
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,208
Does that sound weird to you?

389
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,416
[gasps]

390
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,625
[laughs]

391
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,250
Uh, is something funny?

392
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,458
No, you've made me very happy.

393
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,458
If being around me relaxes you,

394
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:09,041
that means having me here
has become normal for you.

395
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:16,500
[inaudible]

396
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,583
[NAKANO]
I'm not sure if "normal"

397
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:25,291
is the appropriate word.
But yeah,

398
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,791
I guess I have gotten used to
you being here all the time.

399
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:31,083
Well, of course you have,
that's no great surprise.

400
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,458
In that case, I'd like
to make a request.

401
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,083
May I fluff your tail?

402
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,750
You know, to show my gratitude!

403
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,416
[SENKO] I think you just
want to fluff more.

404
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,000
What the heck?

405
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:54,583
How adorable! That outfit
is simply amazing!

406
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:29,000
--[SENKO] Super--
--[SHIRO] Shiro Time!

407
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,500
Took you long enough!

408
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:36,666
I, the Great Shiro, have come
to grace you with my pampering,

409
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,750
so hurry up and get
in here already!

410
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:44,333
Ta-dah! What do you think, isn't
my maid outfit beyond adorable?

411
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:46,666
It's frilly and cute, right?

412
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:51,416
Yes! Feel free to
praise me even more!

413
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,125
Huh? You think that the contrast

414
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,916
between dark and
light is pretty?

415
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,541
I know, my, you have an
excellent eye for fashion!

416
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,666
Welcome back home, Master,
did you have a nice day?

417
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,916
I've prepared you some hot tea.

418
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,875
Wait, what was that,
"You must be dressed like

419
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:10,500
the Taisho Era Nostalgia Maid.
The Japanese elements

420
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:13,375
suit you perfectly.
It's just what I prefer"?

421
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,791
How dare you give her
more praise than me!

422
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:18,500
Be careful, you almost made
me spill the master's tea.

423
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:20,375
Yeah, but... it's not fair!

424
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,250
It's late and
the master is tired.

425
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:25,000
So please try and keep
your voice down, okay?

426
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,666
Fine, drink your dumb tea.

427
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,458
Oh, once you're finished

428
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:32,166
we can play some
video games together!

429
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,625
After this it's bedtime.

430
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:38,250
[SENKO] Thank you for all
of your hard work today.

431
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,625
I hope that you're able
to sleep well tonight.

432
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,750
[SHIRO]
Yeah, have sweet dreams!
