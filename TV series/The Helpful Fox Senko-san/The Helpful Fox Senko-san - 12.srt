00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,458
[NAKANO grunts]

164
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,750
When that happens, maybe you and
I could have a viewing party.

165
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,500
Where are you?

166
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,916
[NAKANO panting]

167
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,083
[NAKANO]
Senko!

168
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,708
Please don't tell me that I'll
never see your face again!

169
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,666
Senko!

170
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:48,541
[SENKO cries]

171
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,000
Ow...

172
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,125
[NAKANO'S ANCESTOR]
Are you all right?

173
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,208
[gasps]

174
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,333
[SENKO gasping]

175
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,208
--[SORA] Sen.
--Yes?

176
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,125
It is no secret you have long
wanted to return the kindness

177
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,791
that man showed to you.

178
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,666
And now you think you finally
have the opportunity to do that,

179
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,958
so I understand your feelings.

180
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,833
Still though. No matter
what the outcome may be,

181
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,583
a sad parting is
what awaits you.

182
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:28,291
Tell me, are you really willing
to suffer like that once again?

183
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,625
[SENKO]
Master! Please, say something!

184
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,041
Don't leave.

185
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,791
I'm so sorry, I still haven't
done anything for you.

186
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,916
[SENKO cries]

187
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,125
[gasps]

188
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,083
Oh, Sen.

189
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:01,166
It's time. Just let it go.

190
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:10,125
Lady Sora. I understand.

191
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,041
Huh?

192
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,416
[SENKO]
Most likely,

193
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,208
events will happen
just as you say.

194
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,166
[SENKO]
Still...

195
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,916
[NAKANO panting]

196
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,083
[SENKO] I'll keep helping him!
For as long as I possibly can!

197
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,458
[NAKANO panting]

198
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,916
[SENKO]
That may be selfish,

199
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,791
but I am going to do it anyway!

200
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:47,333
I might refuse you.
So, then what?

201
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:56,875
Listen to me, Sen.
Everything ends eventually.

202
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,291
[SENKO]
I know.

203
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,625
I know that.

204
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,791
But I still want to pamper
him to his heart's content!

205
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,083
That's great!

206
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:27,791
[SENKO laughs]

207
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:54,750
Could this be what she meant?
It's definitely something bad.

208
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,916
You said you wanted to view
the cherry blossoms together.

209
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,083
Remember that?

210
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,750
And we never went
to that supermarket.

211
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,375
If you had stayed,
we could have gone there.

212
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,291
[NAKANO gasps]

213
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,916
[NAKANO gasps]

214
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,750
Is that you, dear? You're back
earlier than I expected.

215
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,750
Senko. You're...

216
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,958
Whoa! Hey!

217
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,375
Goodness, you're drenched!

218
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,791
Have you been out
in the rain all night?

219
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:58,416
[SENKO] Oh, dear.
Your clothes are such a mess.

220
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,916
[NAKANO] I thought...
I would never see you again.

221
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,708
[gasps] Why would
you think that?

222
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,166
Cause I called you.

223
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,875
Over and over again,
but you didn't answer.

224
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,791
I'm so sorry,
I didn't know that!

225
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,750
I had to go back to
the other world for a bit.

226
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,125
Why did you go there?

227
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,916
Because we were running
low on fried tofu and saké.

228
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,291
But now, we're stocked
and good to go!

229
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,541
Then I came out here because
I wanted to scout out

230
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,708
some good flowers
for our viewing.

231
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:32,458
I was quite surprised
to find you here, too!

232
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,125
Our viewing? [gasps]

233
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,666
[SENKO]
I know! Let's do it right now.

234
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,041
When there's cherry
blossoms in full bloom,

235
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,416
you must celebrate with saké!

236
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,375
[NAKANO]
Uh...

237
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,708
[chuckles]

238
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,166
Her resolve is strong.
I suspect they'll be fine now.

239
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,791
Wait, so you were only
testing her before?

240
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,250
[SORA laughs]
They're quite the pair.

241
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,250
I look forward to seeing
what happens next.

242
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,333
Man a drink sounds great,
thanks so much.

243
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,750
Wait, hold just on a second!

244
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,708
I mean, don't we
kinda stand out?

245
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,375
Like, what if we get reported
to the police or whatever?

246
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,041
Why would we?

247
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,833
[NAKANO]
'Cause you have fox ears.

248
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,625
And it looks like there's little
girl with a grown man in a park

249
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,541
gulping down booze
like nobody's business.

250
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:40,291
I'm the little girl, am I?
You worry too much.

251
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,541
As always, I was
prepared for this.

252
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,541
I've put up a magical
barrier around us.

253
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,041
[NAKANO]
Really, you did?

254
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,458
[SENKO] Yes, so the only people
who will be able to see us

255
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,291
are the ones who
already know me.

256
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,500
Wow, you never cease
to amaze me, Senko.

257
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,583
As a bonus, no one
will bother us.

258
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,791
It's kind of like we get to have

259
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,916
our own private flower
viewing party.

260
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,541
That is pretty cool.

261
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,958
[SENKO] Don't be shy,
go ahead and drink up.

262
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:06,083
Right, okay then. Here goes.

263
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,000
[NAKANO]
Heh! Tastes great!

264
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:13,208
[SENKO] It's a sacred drink that
contains my spiritual energy.

265
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,791
And...

266
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,166
Ta-dah!

267
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,333
I prepared us some light
snacks to go with the saké!

268
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,791
Feel free to help yourself!

269
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,541
Whoa! That is a ton of food!

270
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,833
Heh!

271
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,291
It's amazing!

272
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,208
It's the first catch
of the season!

273
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,083
I think that it tastes
great with saké.

274
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:40,041
[NAKANO] It does! Here,
let me pour you a glass.

275
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,708
[SENKO laughs]
My, what a gentleman!

276
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm so jealous.

277
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,708
You're much better at holding
your liquor than I am.

278
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:55,083
[SENKO laughs]
Yeah, you think so?

279
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,333
[NAKANO]
Wait, are you drunk right now?

280
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,291
That was so fast!

281
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,166
[SENKO] When I'm in the mood to
drink, I'm in the mood to drink.

282
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,666
Is that a problem?

283
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,833
Uh no, guess not.

284
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,250
'S good to hear.
Since I'm drunk,

285
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,458
you're responsible for
making sure I pamper you.

286
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,208
[NAKANO]
I'm not sure that makes sense.

287
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,083
And besides, you pretty much
always pamper me, don't you?

288
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,500
Uh!

289
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,416
That may be true,
but I'll spoil you even more!

290
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,500
Uhh...

291
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,791
Didn't we come out here
for cherry blossom viewing?

292
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,791
I think we should
just focus on that.

293
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,000
You think I'm not?

294
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,666
This was all part of my
flower-viewing plan!

295
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,166
Look up and you'll see why.

296
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,166
[NAKANO gasps]

297
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,125
Not that bad of a view, is it?

298
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:51,125
It's very beautiful. I've scored
the best seat in the house.

299
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,250
Uh?

300
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,750
Is something the matter?

301
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,708
[NAKANO] Well, your hairpin
reminded me of a memory.

302
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:07,000
Hey, Senko. Uh.
Maybe I'm wrong, but...

303
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,416
You've been watching over me
since I was a kid, right?

304
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,583
[gasps] I don't know, have I?

305
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,416
Look, I'm not completely
sure what I should even

306
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,625
say to you here.

307
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,958
I guess... I wanna say thanks.

308
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,625
[SENKO] I can't say I know
what you're talking about.

309
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,750
But there is one
thing I'm sure of.

310
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,166
Huh?

311
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,125
I'm doing all these things
for you because I want to.

312
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:33,375
So honestly, there's nothing
you need to thank me for.

313
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,833
Now lay down, I'm still not
done pampering you, yet.

314
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,166
[NAKANO]
Hey!

315
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,541
[SENKO] Here, is that
more comfortable for you?

316
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,625
You just lay there
and focus on relaxing.

317
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,208
[NAKANO chuckles]

318
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,250
[SENKO] It's not every day
you get to fall asleep

319
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,041
to the beautiful sight
of cherry blossoms.

320
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:53,166
You've got a good point.

321
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,041
Although, I forgot to mention I
have to go into work tomorrow.

322
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,333
We need to go home
soon so I can sleep.

323
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,333
My goodness.
You still don't know

324
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,833
how to just let yourself
be pampered, do you?

325
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,458
Sorry, Senko.

326
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,125
It's okay.

327
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,083
Because it's a part
of who you are,

328
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,666
and I think that
makes you lovely.

329
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,541
But you must be careful not to
wear yourself down too much.

330
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,500
Take the time to relax.

331
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:24,000
And if you keep getting better
at letting yourself be pampered.

332
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,041
What were you saying?

333
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,416
She fell asleep?

334
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,208
Looks like she <i>can't</i>
handle her liquor!

335
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,750
Uh, hey Senko,
you need to wake up!

336
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,541
The park is no place for a nap!

337
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,583
Let's just go home
and get some sleep.

338
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:38,750
[SENKO]
Eep...

339
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:39,916
[NAKANO gasps]

340
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,208
[NAKANO] If I were still
the person I used to be,

341
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,583
I never would've have considered

342
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,000
staying out here
a little longer.

343
00:20:56,916 --> 00:21:00,083
[NAKANO]
But I don't think it can hurt.

344
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,541
[KOENJI]
Hey, it's Senko!

345
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,500
It looks like you
found her, huh?

346
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:08,666
Uh, yeah.

347
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,500
[SENKO grumbles]

348
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,458
And look! There's a feast!

349
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,041
[KOENJI, SHIRO]
Let's dig in!

350
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,500
[KOENJI]
It's good!

351
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:18,666
So yummy!

352
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,333
Hey! I wanna watch <i>Little Yoko</i> !

353
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,208
Oh, yeah? Lookie
what I have here!

354
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,708
Wow! You're awesome, Jasuko!

355
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,125
[BOTH]
Hooray!

356
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:33,541
Yoko! Come back! Please!

357
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,500
Gold coins. Could it be...?

358
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,625
Look there! It's Yoko!

359
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,583
Hello! I'm back, kon!

360
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,833
Yay! Yoko's alive!

361
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:50,125
Man. This part
always makes me cry!

362
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,583
[wails]

363
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,625
It's such a lovely night.

364
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:59,208
Yeah. It really is
something special.

365
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,041
Senko...

366
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,208
Huh?

367
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:07,750
No matter what, I want
us to stick together.

368
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,666
[SENKO gasping]

369
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,208
So do I!

370
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,791
Hello, and welcome home!

371
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,000
My goodness.

372
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,666
You must have had a
terribly long day, huh?
