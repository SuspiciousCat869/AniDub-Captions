1
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,025
[phone ringing]

2
00:00:20,567 --> 00:00:21,608
[NAKANO grunts]

3
00:00:28,942 --> 00:00:30,108
[NAKANO sighs]

4
00:00:37,192 --> 00:00:38,817
It's morning?

5
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,858
Hm?

6
00:00:41,525 --> 00:00:43,483
[NAKANO]
No one's here.

7
00:00:46,858 --> 00:00:48,400
[NAKANO]
That was a crazy dream.

8
00:00:48,483 --> 00:00:50,567
Must've been pretty
tired last night.

9
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,900
[SENKO]
Oh, you're awake?

10
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:52,942
[screams]

11
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:56,567
[NAKANO]
Whoa! You can float?

12
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,442
Good morning,
did you sleep okay?

13
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:07,067
[NAKANO]
Uhh...

14
00:01:10,692 --> 00:01:12,358
Mm?

15
00:01:12,442 --> 00:01:14,275
[NAKANO]
Nope, still not a dream.

16
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:16,150
Uh, good morning to you, too.

17
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:18,150
You're awake so early.

18
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:20,775
That's impressive considering
how late you worked.

19
00:01:20,858 --> 00:01:23,650
I imagine that must
be hard on your body.

20
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:25,400
Oh. Maybe.

21
00:01:25,483 --> 00:01:26,817
I dunno.

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,067
It's been like this for a while.

23
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:37,400
[yawns]

24
00:01:37,483 --> 00:01:38,817
I don't know, it seems to me

25
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,775
that your body requires
a great deal more sleep.

26
00:01:41,858 --> 00:01:43,150
[NAKANO]
Nah, I'm used to it.

27
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:45,525
That's quite unfortunate.

28
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:48,400
Heh. There's no need to worry.

29
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,442
[NAKANO grunts]

30
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:50,900
[groaning]

31
00:01:50,983 --> 00:01:53,525
[SENKO] Oh, apparently there
is every reason to worry!

32
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:55,067
If you're struggling this much,

33
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,025
then perhaps you should
stay home today.

34
00:01:57,108 --> 00:01:59,442
[NAKANO] Look, it's not that I
don't wanna stay home and sleep

35
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:02,733
more, but I have a full-time
job, so I've gotta go to work.

36
00:02:07,483 --> 00:02:10,442
Okay, then I'll make you
breakfast before you go!

37
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:11,442
[NAKANO]
No thanks.

38
00:02:11,525 --> 00:02:13,733
I'm running late as it is. Bye.

39
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:15,025
[SENKO]
Uh. But hold on!

40
00:02:15,108 --> 00:02:17,067
Uh, have a good day!

41
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,400
Uh...

42
00:02:18,483 --> 00:02:21,400
Goodness, he's so stubborn.
I need to figure out

43
00:02:21,483 --> 00:02:24,233
a way to get him to
slow down a little bit.

44
00:02:27,525 --> 00:02:28,358
[SENKO]
That's it!

45
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:29,692
[KOENJI gasping]

46
00:02:33,942 --> 00:02:36,608
[SENKO humming]

47
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:51,275
When you get home tonight, I'm
going to pamper you like crazy!

48
00:02:59,108 --> 00:03:01,483
[NAKANO] Wait, I just realized
that I left Senko at home

49
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:04,525
all by herself.
Will she be okay?

50
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:40,483
[SENKO] All right, then.
Let's start by tidying up!

51
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:55,192
There, that should do the trick!

52
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:57,358
Is that a futon for guests?

53
00:04:57,442 --> 00:04:59,192
And he has a full
set of dinnerware

54
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:02,192
and lots of cooking utensils.

55
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:04,692
Even though his current
lifestyle doesn't lend itself

56
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:07,067
to this idea, there
was a point in time

57
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,817
where he believed he'd play
the part of the gracious host.

58
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,983
Don't worry, from now on

59
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:15,817
I'm going to put all
of you to good use!

60
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,108
Okay! Less leaning,
more cleaning!

61
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,817
[SENKO] First we start
by dusting off the walls.

62
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,067
And then we follow that up
with a nice, good sweeping!

63
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,150
Goodbye, Mister Dust!

64
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:46,442
[sighs]

65
00:05:49,358 --> 00:05:52,275
Scrubbity-dubbity-
rubbity-dubbity!

66
00:05:55,858 --> 00:05:57,275
[laughs]

67
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:10,567
Everything is squeaky clean!
Now all that's left is dinner.

68
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:17,192
For tonight's menu,
I'll make some inari!

69
00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:20,358
After all, he used to like it.

70
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,317
[SENKO]
I'll make a whole bunch!

71
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,275
I really hope he can
come home early today.

72
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,525
[NAKANO sneezes]

73
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:34,192
[MITAKA]
Nakano. Nakano!

74
00:06:34,275 --> 00:06:35,025
What?

75
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:36,442
You're being summoned, man.

76
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:37,483
Uh?

77
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,608
Uhh...

78
00:06:45,692 --> 00:06:47,650
[exhales]

79
00:06:59,275 --> 00:07:03,108
[sighs] Another terrible
day at work.

80
00:07:03,192 --> 00:07:05,650
Wonder what Senko's been up to.

81
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:13,525
[SENKO laughs]
Yay! You're finally back!

82
00:07:13,608 --> 00:07:17,108
You must have had to stay
late at the office again.

83
00:07:17,192 --> 00:07:19,067
It's good to be home.

84
00:07:23,983 --> 00:07:26,817
Well, I'll go heat you up
some miso soup right away!

85
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,442
That sounds nice.

86
00:07:32,358 --> 00:07:33,650
[NAKANO]
Thanks for dinner!

87
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,025
[SENKO laughs]

88
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:51,233
[NAKANO]
That was wonderful.

89
00:07:51,317 --> 00:07:53,067
You sound very refreshed.

90
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,567
To be honest, I normally
just take a shower.

91
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,317
Cleaning the tub
seems like a hassle

92
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,525
when you live by yourself.

93
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:00,358
[SENKO] I love how you
can heat the water here

94
00:08:00,442 --> 00:08:01,650
with just a button.

95
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:03,525
[NAKANO]
Heh. Yeah.

96
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,650
I'm sorry you had to spend
your day cleaning my place.

97
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:08,275
[SENKO]
Why are you apologizing?

98
00:08:08,358 --> 00:08:09,775
[NAKANO]
Well...

99
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:12,567
I just feel bad that you're
working so hard to spoil me.

100
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,025
Don't you remember?

101
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:17,233
I said I'm doing all these
things because I want to.

102
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:19,733
All right.

103
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:21,567
[SENKO] Next time I'll
scrub your back for you!

104
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,817
I can manage that much.

105
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:27,942
[SENKO]
What's the matter?

106
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:29,942
Do you have some water
stuck in your ear?

107
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:32,483
Well, yeah, that's part of it.

108
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:34,983
But my boss also chewed
me out at work today,

109
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:36,317
so there's that, too.

110
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Sounds like some
kind of weird torture.

111
00:08:39,483 --> 00:08:41,317
I'm gonna try cleaning it.

112
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,483
Huh?

113
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:45,108
Let's see... Where are
the cotton swabs?

114
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:47,650
Mm?

115
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:53,942
Hey, wha--?

116
00:08:56,817 --> 00:09:00,317
Come here. I'll give those
ears a proper cleaning.

117
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,692
[NAKANO] Mm. Yeah,
I'm good, thank you though.

118
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,233
[SENKO]
What?! You're "good"?

119
00:09:04,317 --> 00:09:06,983
You'd reject a masterful
ear cleaner such as myself?

120
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,900
No sir, you are most
certainly not good!

121
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:10,942
Now I can die a happy man!

122
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:12,358
[NAKANO]
"Master ear cleaner"?

123
00:09:12,442 --> 00:09:14,025
Is that even like a real thing?

124
00:09:14,108 --> 00:09:15,775
There's no reason
to be afraid over

125
00:09:15,858 --> 00:09:18,025
something as simple
as an ear cleaning!

126
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:20,817
I'm not afraid, I just think
I can clean my own ears.

127
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,900
And having you do it...
makes me feel kinda weird.

128
00:09:24,983 --> 00:09:27,317
Please tell me why!

129
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,233
Uh. Because, y'know,
ears are just...

130
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:33,608
[gasps] Ears are...?

131
00:09:38,817 --> 00:09:41,858
[SENKO]
Okay. Let's make a deal.

132
00:09:41,942 --> 00:09:44,317
Grant me permission
to clean out your ears,

133
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,942
and in return, I shall
let you touch mine.

134
00:09:48,025 --> 00:09:50,817
No way! You'd really allow
me to touch your ears?

135
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,442
Yes. I would.
Just a bit, though.

136
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:56,317
Man Senko, you can read me
like an open book.

137
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,317
Yes, almost like
a picture book.

138
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,942
Then it's settled!

139
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:04,192
Come on. Lie down on my lap.

140
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:06,900
Trust me, you're in
for quite the treat.

141
00:10:10,983 --> 00:10:12,275
[NAKANO]
Whoa there.

142
00:10:12,358 --> 00:10:15,233
Kinda feels like I'm wading
into criminal waters.

143
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:16,942
She's 800 years old...

144
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:19,317
She's 800 years old.

145
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,858
Side note.

146
00:10:20,942 --> 00:10:24,317
I still haven't figured out why
she's doing all this for me.

147
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,358
'Kay, I'm about to begin!

148
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:31,400
[NAKANO]
Oh, wow.

149
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:35,192
I never knew having my ears
touched could feel so good.

150
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:37,983
Let's start by working
our way into this groove.

151
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,858
[sighs]

152
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:49,233
Now, dipping down
ever so gently.

153
00:10:55,942 --> 00:10:57,817
[NAKANO]
She's so close.

154
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,650
I can hear her breathing.

155
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:01,275
[exhales]

156
00:11:01,358 --> 00:11:02,983
[sighs]

157
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,900
[NAKANO]
I feel the warmth of her lap.

158
00:11:07,983 --> 00:11:11,483
The soft fluff of her fur.

159
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:15,733
Ah... That's such
a relaxing sound.

160
00:11:15,817 --> 00:11:19,067
Stay nice and still.
There we go.

161
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:23,525
[NAKANO]
Think I must be...

162
00:11:23,608 --> 00:11:25,900
...in paradise.

163
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:30,858
Ahh...

164
00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:34,192
[NAKANO] I wish I could just
stay right here forever.

165
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:36,650
Please turn so I can get
to the other side.

166
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:38,025
[NAKANO]
Sure.

167
00:11:38,108 --> 00:11:41,025
[NAKANO humming]

168
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:45,983
[NAKANO]
The way she hums is so soothing.

169
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:48,358
Just like a lullaby.

170
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,317
I feel like I'm
a little kid again.

171
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,483
I think I might fall
asleep right here...

172
00:12:07,983 --> 00:12:09,400
What's going on?!

173
00:12:09,483 --> 00:12:11,150
If I didn't know any better I'd
say that you were the one

174
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:12,692
pampering me just now!

175
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,817
[ANCESTOR]
What's wrong with that?

176
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,650
[SENKO] Everything!
I came here to help you

177
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:20,233
and you completely turned
the tables on me!

178
00:12:20,317 --> 00:12:23,775
[ANCESTOR laughs] Do you even
know how adorable you are?

179
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:24,733
[SENKO grumbles]

180
00:12:24,817 --> 00:12:26,233
[ANCESTOR]
Don't fret about it.

181
00:12:26,317 --> 00:12:29,858
Having you around brightens
my mood. That's help enough.

182
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:31,900
[SENKO grumbles]

183
00:12:33,775 --> 00:12:35,275
[gasps]

184
00:12:35,358 --> 00:12:36,650
You up?

185
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:39,400
Did I fall asleep again?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

186
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:41,692
It's no problem!
All are powerless

187
00:12:41,775 --> 00:12:44,025
before my masterful
ear cleaning technique.

188
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:46,400
You look like a kid
when you sleep, it's cute.

189
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:48,650
[NAKANO]
Uh, cute?

190
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:50,067
[NAKANO]
But, wait...

191
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:55,400
[NAKANO]
Was that a dream?

192
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,942
It was so vivid.

193
00:12:57,025 --> 00:12:59,608
And somehow, it felt familiar.

194
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:01,150
Hey listen, Senko.

195
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:04,525
This is a weird question,
but have we ever met before?

196
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,192
[SENKO]
Hm. That is an odd question.

197
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:13,317
I can't remember the face
of every child I've seen.

198
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,608
[NAKANO]
Mm.

199
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:18,025
[SENKO]
So I guess... it is possible.

200
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:20,233
We may have met sometime before.

201
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:24,858
I see.

202
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:29,233
Oh, right! Now it's my turn
to touch your ears, Senko!

203
00:13:29,317 --> 00:13:32,608
[SENKO] Aw. I was sort
of hoping you'd forget.

204
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,692
Just keep in mind
that they're delicate!

205
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:40,858
Uh-huh.

206
00:13:40,942 --> 00:13:42,192
So make sure that you're
gentle with them!

207
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:43,067
Sure.

208
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,192
Really gentle!

209
00:13:44,275 --> 00:13:45,025
Can do.

210
00:13:45,108 --> 00:13:46,817
As gentle as gentle can be!

211
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,858
[NAKANO]
Yeah, yeah, I'll be gentle.

212
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:53,108
[inhales]

213
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:05,900
Well?! What on earth
are you waiting for?!

214
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:08,817
Oh. Uh. I'm sorry.

215
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,650
Okay. Here goes.

216
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:13,400
[SENKO squeaks]

217
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:15,733
I, uh, uh, uh.

218
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:18,025
[NAKANO] It's a whole
different kinda fluff.

219
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,358
Even softer than the tail.

220
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,150
Feels like I'm wearing
mittens made of clouds.

221
00:14:23,233 --> 00:14:24,942
I never wanna take them off.

222
00:14:25,025 --> 00:14:26,608
[SENKO]
Mm... Okay. Listen.

223
00:14:26,692 --> 00:14:28,108
You had better control yourself.

224
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:31,067
I wonder what the inside
of them feels like.

225
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,775
Huh?

226
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:41,567
[SENKO screams]

227
00:14:57,858 --> 00:15:01,650
[NAKANO] I'm so sorry!
I really am, please forgive me!

228
00:15:07,942 --> 00:15:09,442
I regret my actions deeply.

229
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:11,525
And I accept full
responsibility,

230
00:15:11,608 --> 00:15:13,358
is there anything I can do
to make it up to you?

231
00:15:13,442 --> 00:15:15,900
Don't be silly. You know what?

232
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:18,067
I think it's about time
you went to bed.

233
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,275
Yeah, okay.

234
00:15:19,358 --> 00:15:21,692
Or, wait, it seems a
little early actually.

235
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:23,067
Well it's not!

236
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,483
Go to sleep now and you
won't be so tired tomorrow!

237
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:27,775
You need to get eight hours
of sleep each night!

238
00:15:27,858 --> 00:15:29,858
There's no way I can
sleep that much.

239
00:15:29,942 --> 00:15:31,608
I'll just end up late for work.

240
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:34,150
Most nights I sleep for about
four hours and it's fine.

241
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,817
Only four hours,
you must be kidding.

242
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,275
There's no way. Are you
even a human being?

243
00:15:39,358 --> 00:15:41,817
[NAKANO]
More so than you, at least.

244
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,608
[SENKO]
It's become painfully apparent

245
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,400
that you don't get enough rest.
You need to take care

246
00:15:46,483 --> 00:15:48,692
of your body,
it's the only one you have.

247
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:51,733
[NAKANO] I know that.
I'm just so busy these days.

248
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:55,483
[sighs] Do you mean to keep
this up till you get sick?

249
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:57,317
I'm not having it!

250
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,025
If you're busy, that's all
the more reason to sleep.

251
00:16:00,108 --> 00:16:02,650
Exhaustion hinders your ability
to work, which forces you

252
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:06,442
to spend more time working,
which makes you more tired!

253
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:08,608
I know some pro sleepers.

254
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,025
If anyone needs me,

255
00:16:11,108 --> 00:16:13,442
tell them I'll be napping
for the next few centuries.

256
00:16:13,525 --> 00:16:16,067
The best of them can sleep
for a few hundred years!

257
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,983
Something tells me that
these friends of yours

258
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:19,692
don't have day jobs.

259
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:21,192
Also, I should mention

260
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:24,442
I've been having insomnia
lately. Not sure I can sleep.

261
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:28,650
[SENKO laughs]
That shouldn't be an issue now.

262
00:16:31,108 --> 00:16:32,442
I hung this out in the sun.

263
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:35,025
It's like a whole
new blanket now.

264
00:16:35,108 --> 00:16:36,817
[gasps]

265
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:42,400
[gasping]

266
00:16:42,483 --> 00:16:44,442
[laughs]

267
00:16:46,108 --> 00:16:50,358
Wow! It's so fluffy and it
smells just like sunshine!

268
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,275
I'm so happy.

269
00:16:52,358 --> 00:16:55,317
Thanks, I haven't had time
to hang it myself in ages.

270
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,858
It does make a difference.
I'm drifting off already.

271
00:16:58,942 --> 00:17:01,233
[SENKO]
Of course you are.

272
00:17:01,317 --> 00:17:03,650
[yawns]

273
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:06,150
Come to think of it, I'm
pretty tuckered out myself.

274
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,525
Think I'll turn
in for the night.

275
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:12,817
[gasps]

276
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,150
I'm gonna go ahead and turn
these lights off, kay?

277
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:29,150
[SENKO]
M'kay. Goodnight. Sweet dreams.

278
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:30,858
Uh...

279
00:17:30,942 --> 00:17:34,150
[NAKANO] Jeez, even the
way she sleeps is cute.

280
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:38,733
Little floofball. I wanna jam
my face right in her fur.

281
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,942
[NAKANO] Eh, better not.
She looks so peaceful.

282
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,567
I'll just go to bed.

283
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:03,567
[NAKANO grunts]

284
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,067
[NAKANO]
I am such trash.

285
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,775
Making a demigod sleep on
the floor while I'm in bed.

286
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:09,817
That's beyond bad luck!

287
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,733
I may as well attack
a mirror factory.

288
00:18:12,817 --> 00:18:14,942
[NAKANO]
Hey, uh, Senko?

289
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:16,400
Yeah, what's goin' on?

290
00:18:16,483 --> 00:18:18,150
I'm sorry, I didn't
realize that you'd--

291
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:21,025
What the--? Are those fireballs?

292
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:22,358
S'just fox-fire.

293
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:23,400
[NAKANO]
Fox-fire...?

294
00:18:23,483 --> 00:18:25,525
Ya havin' trouble
fallin' asleep?

295
00:18:25,608 --> 00:18:27,150
I'm okay, I was just
worried about you

296
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:29,442
on that little cushion; it
can't be very comfortable.

297
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,525
I've got guest futons in the
closet, let me pull one out.

298
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:34,192
Oh, I get it now.

299
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:37,733
Is this your attempt at
being subtle? Honestly.

300
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:45,358
If you wished for us
to sleep together,

301
00:18:45,442 --> 00:18:47,817
you should've just said so.

302
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,192
Now go to sleep, okay?

303
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:51,442
Um, not to be rude,

304
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:53,108
but that really isn't
what I was getting at.

305
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:54,900
You're such a cute little baby.

306
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:57,317
Come on, silly,
don't be shy now.

307
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,025
This is perfectly innocent.

308
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:01,608
After all, you're just
like a kid to me.

309
00:19:01,692 --> 00:19:02,942
[NAKANO]
Uhh...

310
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:08,692
Yeah. Ya know,

311
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:10,900
it still feels pretty weird to
hear that from a little girl.

312
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,442
Oh, please! Try to remember

313
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:15,483
that I've been around for
several human lifetimes.

314
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:20,817
[NAKANO]
Whelp. I guess this is better

315
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,358
than letting her
sleep on the floor.

316
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,525
Uh.

317
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:33,108
[NAKANO] Pudgy little cheeks.
Fluffy tufts of fur.

318
00:19:33,192 --> 00:19:35,525
Who knew that a god
could be so cute?

319
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,317
And fragile, from
the look of her.

320
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,983
This is just too much.

321
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:41,400
How can I sleep like this?

322
00:19:44,858 --> 00:19:45,858
Uh.

323
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:58,900
[NAKANO]
Huh. Is this... better?

324
00:19:58,983 --> 00:20:00,983
Can't really say for sure.

325
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:05,483
[NAKANO]
Okay, yeah.

326
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,150
This is nice.

327
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:16,775
[SENKO]
Eat it!

328
00:20:16,858 --> 00:20:18,608
[NAKANO] I'd love to,
but I don't have time.

329
00:20:18,692 --> 00:20:20,108
Then make time!

330
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:22,150
I'm not letting you leave until
you've had some breakfast,

331
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:23,567
and that's final!

332
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,733
[NAKANO] All right! All right!
I'll have some, thanks.

333
00:20:24,817 --> 00:20:25,858
[SENKO laughs]

334
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,692
Are you ready to
depart for work?

335
00:20:40,775 --> 00:20:42,358
Yeah, almost.

336
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:47,567
You're a great guy.
Do you know that?

337
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,942
Don't push yourself too hard.

338
00:20:51,025 --> 00:20:52,567
I'll try.

339
00:20:55,275 --> 00:20:57,942
See ya soon, and thanks
for breakfast.

340
00:20:58,025 --> 00:20:59,442
Of course!

341
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:02,775
Have a good day at work, okay?

342
00:21:02,858 --> 00:21:05,858
Bye! Make sure and be careful!

343
00:21:05,942 --> 00:21:08,900
Come back home
as swiftly as you can!

344
00:21:08,983 --> 00:21:10,317
[KOENJI growls]

345
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,567
How many friggin' ways
are there to say goodbye?

346
00:22:45,775 --> 00:22:47,858
[SENKO]
Super Senko Time!

347
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:52,067
Hi there, welcome back home.

348
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,733
You've had a long day.
I'm sure you must be tired.

349
00:22:54,817 --> 00:22:57,233
Why don't you lay down on my lap
and let me have a look at you?

350
00:22:57,317 --> 00:23:00,983
We'll see if we can't get
rid of all that work-stress.

351
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:03,067
Would you like me
to clean your ears?

352
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,233
Don't be nervous.
I know what I'm doing.

353
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,858
Just settle down
and enjoy yourself.

354
00:23:07,942 --> 00:23:09,817
We'll start with this side.

355
00:23:13,317 --> 00:23:15,692
I hope it doesn't
tickle too much.

356
00:23:18,483 --> 00:23:20,733
[exhales]

357
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,192
Good! Looks like
we're all done here.

358
00:23:23,275 --> 00:23:25,817
That felt pretty nice, right?

359
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,942
Mm-hm! Glad to hear it!

360
00:23:28,025 --> 00:23:31,358
I can help clean your ears again
anytime you'd like me to.

361
00:23:31,442 --> 00:23:33,317
With that being said,
it's still important

362
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,025
that we take care not to
over-indulge ourselves.

363
00:23:36,108 --> 00:23:39,775
So it's best if we wait a bit
before we do this again.

364
00:23:39,858 --> 00:23:43,233
Well, it's time for
bed now, okay?

365
00:23:43,317 --> 00:23:45,442
Good night and sweet dreams!
