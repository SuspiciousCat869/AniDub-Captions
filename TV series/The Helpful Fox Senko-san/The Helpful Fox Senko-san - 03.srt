I don't understand these

Hi, can you send
the cops, please?

might be a kidnapper.

No!

37

All this time I've been
under the assumption

38
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,333
that my neighbor lived alone.

Neighbor?

Ohh.

you were a weird perv

Uhh...

00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,000
[NAKANO]
I guess it does look that way.

45
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,416
[NAKANO]
Wait, it's not like that!

46
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,916
We were just playing around!

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,583
I-I-I'm not keeping her against
her will! Right? Tell her!

48
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,833
[SENKO] Correct!
This apartment is free of crime!

49
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:55,583
Furthermore, I came of age
a great many years ago.

50
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,083
Meaning what?

51
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,416
That there are no
legal issues here.

52
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,375

all over me.

What's wrong?

I'm only stating the
facts of the situation.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,625
Well, if she's legal.
Guess it's cool.

That's it? No further questions?

[KOENJI] Man. You guys are so
freaking loud, I was at least

able to make you shut up.

Uh.

[KOENJI growls]

63
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,000
[NAKANO] I guess that means
she's not going to report us,

64
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,041
so that's good.

65
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,541
Hm?

66
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,791
Huh? [giggles]

67
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,125
[NAKANO] Though she's obviously
still suspicious of us,

68
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,166
and I can't really blame her.

69
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,208
But if I'm gonna keep
living with Senko,

70
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,666
I gotta find a way for this girl
to be on board with the idea.

71
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,000
How the heck am I supposed
to explain "Senko" to her?

Don't worry,
I'll handle this one.

[NAKANO] Okay. Like with
fox magic or what?

74

[SENKO]
Quick question.

75
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:00,958
For me?

76

[SENKO]
Mm-hm.

77
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,875
We have some extra food
from last night.

Would you like a little stew?

Extra food?

80
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,833

her with leftovers?

It's yummy!

You see now. Didn't I tell you?

89
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,166
Yeah!

90
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,166
[NAKANO] She's like a completely
different person now.

91
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,791
Oh, wow! Hands down,
best food ever!

92
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:55,541
Really? Well, you certainly
seem to be enjoying all of it.

93
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,000
Watching you eat it
makes me very happy.

94
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,500
[KOENJI]
It's awesome!

95
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,541
Then again, I haven't had a
good meal in like two days.

96
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,791
Two days?!

97
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,583
That's right.

98
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,625
[NAKANO] I'm surprised
you're still alive.

99
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,333
Uh, sorry, what was
your name again?

100
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,875
Oh! My bad.

101
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:14,333
I guess we skipped the
whole introduction part.

102
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,833
My name's Koenji,
and I live next door to ya.

103
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:20,250
I work from home during the day
and I'm also a college student.

104
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:23,583
At least sometimes, anyway.

105
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,333
Only sometimes?

106
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,333
So, you're both working and
studying at the same time?

107
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,125
That's most impressive!

108
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,166
Well, anyway. Sorry for
making such a huge fuss.

109
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,083
[SENKO laughs] I'm glad we
could reach an understanding.

110
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,458
Me, too! If someone
invites you in their place

111
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,458
and gives you free food,
they must be nice!

112
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,333
[NAKANO] I'm pretty sure
that's not always the case.

113
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,750
[KOENJI]
So, what's your story?

114
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,333
[NAKANO grunts]

115
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,958
[NAKANO]
Good question.

116
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,625
How do I explain
our relationship?

117
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,625
It's... complicated.

118
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,833
Well. My name is Nakano.
I work, too. Boring stuff.

119
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:02,041
And you may call me Senko.

120
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,958
I'm his wife,
as well as his mother!

121
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,458
Uh.

122
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:11,583
[NAKANO] That relationship
doesn't make any sense!

123
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,083
Makes sense!

124
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,125
That's pretty much what I
figured when I first saw you.

125
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,875
[NAKANO] Was she even listening
to what Senko said?

126
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:23,291
[KOENJI sighs] Thank you for
the food, it was amazing!

127
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,833
Wow. I haven't felt
this full in ages.

128
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,208
It's my pleasure!
In the future

129
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,875
I'd be happy to share our
extra leftovers with you.

130
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,916
[KOENJI]
Shut up! Are you serious?!

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,625
[NAKANO] Groceries just
got more expensive.

132
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,625
Perhaps I could ask you
for a favor, too.

133
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,416
I realize that on occasion
we can be a little bit noisy.

134
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Will you please overlook it?

135
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,083
Oh! Sure. No problem at all.

136
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,333
[SENKO]
Really?

137
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah, totally, I'm like
a super chill person.

138
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,541
A little noise doesn't
bother me. [laughs]

139
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,500
[NAKANO] We must have different
definitions of "chill."

140
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,791
This is crazy, I had
no idea that I had

141
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,750
such an adorable chef
for a neighbor.

142
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,291
Man, I really wish I could
have met you sooner.

143
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:07,166
Heh! Oh, please, your praise
is too much. Right?

144
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,500
I guess.

145
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:09,958
[SENKO]
What do you mean you guess?

146
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:13,291
[NAKANO] Huh? Wait, that's...
That's not what I meant!

147
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,083
[SENKO laughs]
I'm only teasing.

148
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,125
Uh, hey.

149
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,583
--Yeah.
--[SENKO] Huh?

150
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,166
I appreciate the food, but
I need to ask you something.

151
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,375
[SENKO]
Hm?

152
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,875
[NAKANO] I knew it.
She's finally caught on.

153
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,458
Yeah? Sure, ask away.

154
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:35,083
About... those ears.
And the tail...

155
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,291
[gulps]

156
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,750
Tell me. It's one of those

157
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,041
"Little Yoko: Inari Girl"
cosplays, right?

158
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,791
[YOKO]
Kon, kon!

159
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,166
Say wha...?

160
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:57,500
[YOKO laughing]

161
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:01,666
[YOKO] Little Yoko:
Inari Girl! Kon, kon, kon!

162
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,000
[TANUKIMAN] Oh, I'm gonna getcha
little girl, yes I will.

163
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,541
[YOKO] Mister Tanukiman
is taking photos

164
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,208
without permission again!

165
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,916
[YOKO]
Take this!

166
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,416
[YOKO yells]

167
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,500
[YOKO]
Ha!

168
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,791
Kon, kon, victory!

169
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,375
Uh-- Uhh...

170
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,000
Did you say "closet play"?
What is that?

171
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:28,375
Yes! Yes, it is!
Wow, you have such a keen eye!

172
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,708
[laughing]

173
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,666
That's the coolest thing ever!

174
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,791
Dude, I'm like the biggest
"Little Yoko" fan!

175
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,958
Gah! This has made my whole day!

176
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,291
[SENKO]
Huh?

177
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,500
[NAKANO sighs]

178
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,750
Hey! Please. Can you
strike a pose for me?

179
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,041
Strike it?

180
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,041
Yeah, you know!
Strike a pose! Like this.

181
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,291
Oh, okay. My pleasure.

182
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,708
[KOENJI screams]
So cute!

183
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,750
Now can you give me a "Kon, kon,
kon!" just like Little Yoko?!

184
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,625
Kon, kon, kon...?

185
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,500
[KOENJI]
Yas!

186
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,125
Uh!

187
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,666
[gasps]

188
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,166
Your ears... How can you
make them move like that?

189
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,875
Uh? I'm afraid I
don't understand.

190
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:11,541
They're a part of me, just like
the rest of my body parts are.

191
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,375
[KOENJI]
Huh?

192
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,708
She means metaphorically!

193
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,208
Oh, now I see.

194
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,833
You just don't wanna break
character, is that right?

195
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:18,833
Uh?

196
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,083
Break who now?

197
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,833
Right! Senko is hardcore!

198
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,000
You know.
She's a method cosplayer!

199
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:24,875
[SENKO]
Hm?

200
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,958
All righty, I'll see
you guys later.

201
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,500
Let's talk more Yoko soon, 'kay?

202
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,583
[NAKANO sighs]
Hurricane Koenji has passed.

203
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,166
[SENKO laughs]

204
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,500
You know what,

205
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,750
I think she could also use
a little fox pampering.

206
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,791
[SENKO]
Hm? Something wrong?

207
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,375
Oh. Kinda?
It's our relationship.

208
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,750
I just think we need
a better explanation.

209
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,333
Like maybe you could be
my niece or something.

210
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,375
Oh, are you not satisfied
with wife and mother?

211
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,208
[NAKANO]
For starters, it sounds weird.

212
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,833
[SENKO grumbles]

213
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,083
[NAKANO] Guess we'll have
to watch that anime now.

214
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,583
[SENKO]
Who's "Anna May"?

215
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,458
Does she also need my care?

216
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,750
[NAKANO] This might be
harder than I thought.

217
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,750
[YOKO laughs]
Kon-kon, kon-kon!

218
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,916
[TANUKIMAN] At last, this
will be the end of you.

219
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,708
[YOKO] Oh, no! Cut it out,
you big meanie!

220
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,500
[TANUKIMAN]
Buh-bye now!

221
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,625
[laughing]

222
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,166
[YOKO]
To be continued!

223
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,958
Eep! What's gonna
happen to Little Yoko?

224
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,875
We won't find out
until next week.

225
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,958
No fair! But I would like to
know what happens immediately.

226
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:46,375
How sad. I wish we could start
watching it from the beginning.

227
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,375
Wish granted.

228
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,541
There.

229
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,583
And here's episode one.

230
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,333
Amazing! With only
the push of a button?

231
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,416
Yep.

232
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,458
It's like magic!
Truly. You're a genius!

233
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,041
Nuh-uh. Anyone can do this.

234
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,333
[YOKO]
Kon, kon, kon!

235
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,500
[NAKANO]
And she's already hooked.

236
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,791
[YOKO]
To be continued!

237
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,125
Aww. Watching all
of them only makes me

238
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,500
want to see next week's
episode even more.

239
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,166
Uh?

240
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,833
Would you like for me
to start on dinner now?

241
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:26,666
[yawns] Sure thing.

242
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,541
Okay, I shall prepare you
another nutritious meal

243
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,458
right away. Served with
a fresh side of love!

244
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:35,125
Is there anything you
would like in particular?

245
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,375
Un-uh, not really.

246
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,500
To be honest with ya,
I'm good with whatever.

247
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:42,500
Oh, my. That's by far the most
difficult request to fulfill.

248
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,500
You are hopeless.

249
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:48,041
Let's see now,
what's in the refrigerator?

250
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,375
Oh, nothing.
That complicates things.

251
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,208
[SENKO] And I'm afraid we've
used up all the supplies

252
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,833
I brought with me.

253
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:01,083
Well, it looks like I'm
off to do some shopping.

254
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,791
Shopping, huh? You'd better
let me handle it.

255
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,041
I'll go, you just stay
here and relax.

256
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:09,291
You're still recovering
from your long work week.

257
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,333
Okay, then. I'll be back
before you know it.

258
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,291
Wait, Senko! Hold on.

259
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:20,541
Uh. Going out like that?
Not a good plan.

260
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,541
But why? It seems reasonable.

261
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,875
Is there some sort of
problem I'm not seeing?

262
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,291
There sure is.

263
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,583
[SENKO]
You truly are a worrywart!

264
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:32,000
Look, as long as you act like
it's normal, nobody will care.

265
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,416
Huh?

266
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,666
If anything. They will simply
assume I'm "cosplaying."

267
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,666
Except that people normally
don't shop in costume.

268
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,041
[SENKO]
Huh?

269
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,166
[NAKANO]
Wear this.

270
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,416
I'm just gonna worry
if you go out alone.

271
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,416
I'd feel better tagging along.

272
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,833
[SENKO grumbles]

273
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:32,375
[gasps] So this is what
you call a supermarket!

274
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,416
I can't believe you have access
to such a large shopping space.

275
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,375
Oh yeah, believe it or not,
this is one of the smaller ones.

276
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:42,333
[SENKO]
Ooh! Extraordinary!

277
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,041
It's rather exciting to see all
these different kinds of food

278
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,916
together under
one roof like this.

279
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,208
Markets sure have changed a lot
over the years. Interesting!

280
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,708
[NAKANO] I wonder how
many years have passed

281
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,875
since she last went shopping?

282
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,250
[SENKO]
They even have vegetables

283
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,458
that are out of season!

284
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,708
Okay, then. Know what
you're gonna buy?

285
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,666
Of course! To start with...

286
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,833
We should pick out
some fresh vegetables.

287
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:08,083
Right. What about this one?

288
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,416
It's nice n' big.

289
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,750
[SENKO]
Hold on a moment.

290
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,208
Here, let's get this one,
it's much better.

291
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,708
You can really tell that
just by looking at it?

292
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:20,125
Yes, naturally! I'm not
just a demi-god.

293
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,750
I'm also a deity of agriculture.

294
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,416
[NAKANO]
Ahh!

295
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,291
Why, I could pick out a
good vegetable in my sleep!

296
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,041
Wow, having a deity of
agriculture around the house

297
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,041
sure is handy.

298
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:36,291
Ooh! This one looks
particularly good!

299
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,958
[NAKANO]
I'm so dumb.

300
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,375
Letting her appearance
fool me like that.

301
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,333
I totally forgot
she's a demi-god.

302
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,750
She's over 800 years old.

303
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,958
Of course she can handle
something as simple as shopping.

304
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,875
[NAKANO] Seriously. The only
thing I know how to shop for is

305
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:59,583
instant ramen. I should really
leave this one to the expert.

306
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,416
[SENKO gasping]

307
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,375
[SENKO]
Fried tofu!

308
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,000
Which should I pick?
They all look so delicious!

309
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,250
[NAKANO laughs]

310
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,750
[NAKANO] It seems even
the great goddess Senko

311
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,250
has her childish moments.

312
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,541
Who knew she'd like
fried tofu so much?

313
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,958
[SENKO]
Make room for these!

314
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:14,791
[NAKANO]
Hm?

315
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,500
[NAKANO]

a kid in a candy store.

No, I'm fine.

It's this one, right?

Oh, good. You managed
after all, huh?

00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,583
Yes, I did. It was child's play.

That is definitely cheating!

Get down, now! You can't
just float in public!

No need to worry.
It's not like anyone saw me.

No. But your ears were showing.

I think you should try to
be a little more discreet.

You need to calm down,
it's really not a problem.

would a girl have a fox tail?

I've seen plenty of
