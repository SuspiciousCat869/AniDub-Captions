[SENKO humming]

2
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:24,567
Today's special
report is all about

3
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,900
must-try gratin from
popular restaurants!

4
00:00:28,983 --> 00:00:30,608
That looks good!

5
00:00:30,692 --> 00:00:31,900
Hey, you need to hurry up

6
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:35,067
or you're going to be
late for work. Uh?

7
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,317
What's this TV program about?

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,733
Uh, food? It just came on
and I got a bit distracted.

9
00:00:40,817 --> 00:00:42,317
So, what do you guys think?

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,733
Here's the famous cheese gratin

11
00:00:43,817 --> 00:00:46,025
that everyone's
been raving about!

12
00:00:46,108 --> 00:00:50,108
Many refer to this dish as
"the mouth's paradise"!

13
00:00:50,192 --> 00:00:52,233
She's making cheese gratin?

14
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:53,567
[NAKANO]
Yeah...

15
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:57,942
[REPORTER]
Mm! When you take a bite,

16
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,983
the melted cheese
covers your taste buds

17
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:03,942
and wraps them in a warm,
delicious hug!

18
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:07,358
Crap! The time!
Shoot, I gotta go!

19
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:11,692
I'm sorry, Senko!
I'll see you later tonight.

20
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:13,442
Bye, have a good day!

21
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:14,900
[NAKANO]
You, too!

22
00:01:14,983 --> 00:01:16,983
[REPORTER] And here's the
next restaurant's gratin!

23
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:20,192
Check out this spread! Oh!

24
00:01:20,275 --> 00:01:21,650
With all that melty cheese,

25
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:24,733
it's practically screaming
to be devoured!

26
00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:27,108
That's very interesting.

27
00:03:03,192 --> 00:03:06,150
[KOENJI] Huh? You wanna learn
how to make cheese gratin?

28
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:08,317
Yes. I've never made one,

29
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,608
so I'm not familiar
with the recipe.

30
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:12,733
Well, it's really not
that difficult.

31
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,233
Even I know how to do it.

32
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:15,608
[gasping]

33
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:18,233
I had no idea you were
capable of cooking Jasuko!

34
00:03:18,317 --> 00:03:19,650
Yeah, a little.

35
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,275
So how come you've never made
anything for me, then?

36
00:03:22,358 --> 00:03:25,275
It's a pain, so I avoid
it as much as possible.

37
00:03:25,358 --> 00:03:26,817
Lazy!

38
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,108
[KOENJI] The pot doesn't get
to call the kettle black, Shiro.

39
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:30,775
[laughs]

40
00:03:30,858 --> 00:03:32,858
[KOENJI]
You surprise me, Senko.

41
00:03:32,942 --> 00:03:35,650
I kind of thought you'd already
know how to make gratin.

42
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:37,358
Seeing as you're such
a great cook and all.

43
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:39,025
[SENKO] Unfortunately,
I don't know much about

44
00:03:39,108 --> 00:03:42,525
western-style food. Japanese
cuisine is my specialty.

45
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:44,275
Yeah, but nobody can
top your cooking--

46
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,150
it's the best in
the whole entire world!

47
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:47,942
Please, that's an exaggeration.

48
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:51,025
It's not, though!
Your food is super delicious.

49
00:03:51,108 --> 00:03:53,025
Thanks for making it.

50
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,233
[SENKO]
You don't have to thank me,

51
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,358
it's something I
truly enjoy doing.

52
00:03:56,442 --> 00:03:59,983
And that's one of the
things I love about you.

53
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:04,317
Okay. I'm going to help
you cook up some gratin!

54
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,650
Sound good?

55
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:08,275
As in right now?
But aren't you too busy?

56
00:04:08,358 --> 00:04:10,400
[KOENJI] Yeah, but I have
a bit of artist's block.

57
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,275
So shifting gears might help.

58
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:13,442
Thank you!

59
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:15,608
Perhaps I could
help you as well.

60
00:04:15,692 --> 00:04:17,817
[SENKO gasps]
You really mean it?

61
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,942
Thank you so much.
This means a lot to me.

62
00:04:22,025 --> 00:04:24,067
I wonder how many hundreds
of years it's been

63
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,192
since Shiro has offered
to help me with anything.

64
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:27,858
Now that's an exaggeration!

65
00:04:27,942 --> 00:04:31,233
[KOENJI laughs]
"Hundreds of years," really?

66
00:04:31,317 --> 00:04:33,858
You guys have the
wackiest sense of humor.

67
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:37,692
Okay. Right! I'll go start
setting everything up.

68
00:04:37,775 --> 00:04:40,150
I think I may already know
the answer to this question,

69
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:42,858
but does Koenji think you're
cosplaying as well, Shiro?

70
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:44,733
Of course she does!

71
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,400
Of course.

72
00:04:50,442 --> 00:04:52,483
And the last thing
we need is butter.

73
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:55,233
All righty! I think
that about covers it.

74
00:04:55,317 --> 00:04:57,983
I'm unfamiliar with a great
deal of these ingredients.

75
00:04:58,067 --> 00:04:59,733
What's this strange food called?

76
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:03,025
Uh? Oh, those are just
some macaroni noodles.

77
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:04,525
[crunching]

78
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:07,233
Yucky, these taste terrible,
I advise against using them.

79
00:05:07,317 --> 00:05:09,942
Yeah, you're supposed to cook
them before you eat them.

80
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:13,775
You really can't eat macaroni
when it's raw like that.

81
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:16,608
You should have told me
that sooner, Jasuko!

82
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:19,358
You cook it by boiling
it in hot water.

83
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:20,733
Cook it, huh?

84
00:05:20,817 --> 00:05:23,650
Well then, leave the controlling
of the flame to me!

85
00:05:29,358 --> 00:05:30,108
[KOENJI]
Huh?

86
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:31,108
[SENKO]
Hm?

87
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,108
Aw, that's adorable, I used
to play pretend like that

88
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:40,317
back when I was a little kid.

89
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,900
I'd be shooting invisible flames

90
00:05:41,983 --> 00:05:44,567
all over the place super
hero-style, it was fun!

91
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,775
[SENKO gasping]

92
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:48,192
I'll turn it up just a bit.

93
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:49,525
[SENKO gasping]

94
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:51,900
[laughs] Wow, you've really
perfected your act,

95
00:05:51,983 --> 00:05:54,442
you almost had me fooled
there for a second!

96
00:05:56,942 --> 00:05:59,483
You're always so fun
and care-free, Shiro.

97
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,692
Yes, she's very playful.

98
00:06:03,358 --> 00:06:05,025
It's finally boiling!

99
00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:06,400
Okay, great!

100
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:09,067
Now just go ahead and pour
that macaroni in there.

101
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,692
As you wish.

102
00:06:12,817 --> 00:06:15,775
Don't worry,
I'll keep the fire going!

103
00:06:17,358 --> 00:06:19,275
Sounds like she's got
everything under control.

104
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:20,442
[yelps]

105
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:21,692
[SENKO]
Uhh...

106
00:06:22,692 --> 00:06:23,900
[KOENJI]
All right, now we can move on

107
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,775
to the next part of the recipe.

108
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:30,442
Chop the onions
into small slices.

109
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:33,900
And cut the bacon
into thin strips.

110
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,983
Melt the butter in the pan.

111
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:39,692
Then add the flour and milk,
mixing them in slowly.

112
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:40,858
Right.

113
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:46,317
Oh, and I need to
stir it frequently,

114
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,275
so it doesn't get any odd lumps.

115
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:51,233
[SENKO hums]

116
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:55,942
Uh... She's so skilled,
does she even need me here?

117
00:06:58,233 --> 00:07:00,025
Is this the right consistency?

118
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:01,525
You bet, it's perfect!

119
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:03,983
The next thing you wanna do
is add in the onions, bacon,

120
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:06,400
and cooked macaroni
noodles from earlier!

121
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:07,608
Here you go!

122
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:09,733
Thanks, that's very helpful.

123
00:07:14,983 --> 00:07:16,733
Now, it's time for
some seasoning,

124
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:18,858
a little salt and pepper
should do the trick.

125
00:07:18,942 --> 00:07:20,067
[SHIRO]
Ahh...

126
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,317
[SENKO]
What are you doing?

127
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,817
This recipe doesn't
call for any sugar.

128
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,067
Huh? Are you sure, though?

129
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,317
[SENKO] It's called cheese
gratin, not sugar gratin.

130
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,567
Fine.

131
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,067
But the sweetness would
only improve the taste.

132
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,025
It's almost like she
has absolute faith

133
00:07:36,108 --> 00:07:38,025
in the power of sugar.

134
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:40,775
[SENKO]
Okay, what's next?

135
00:07:40,858 --> 00:07:44,150
Uh. Let's see. It's time for us
to pour it into the baking dish.

136
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,608
You got it.

137
00:07:49,608 --> 00:07:52,983
And now you can put
the cheese on the top.

138
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:54,733
I like this; it's tasty.

139
00:07:54,817 --> 00:07:58,192
Stop that Shiro! It's for
cooking, not snacking.

140
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,608
Okay, I'm all finished.

141
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:03,983
[KOENJI]
Good job!

142
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,442
[KOENJI]
Lastly, we need to bake it,

143
00:08:07,525 --> 00:08:09,400
so you pop inside the old oven.

144
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:10,900
Wait, oven?

145
00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:13,692
But isn't that what you
refer to as a "microwave"?

146
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:16,067
You can use it for baking
just like an oven!

147
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,692
It's kind of like a tiny
Japanese kiln you know?

148
00:08:18,775 --> 00:08:20,067
[SENKO]
I see!

149
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,692
I was not aware that they
made kilns of this size.

150
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:26,233
Children have it so
easy this day and age.

151
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:28,650
How funny, sometimes
you really remind me

152
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:30,608
of an old woman, Senko.

153
00:08:30,692 --> 00:08:33,108
Uh-oh, better watch
your language, grandma.

154
00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:35,567
Think so?

155
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,317
[KOENJI]
Here we go!

156
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:43,900
[SHIRO] Hm? Is it done yet?
How about now?

157
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:46,983
Hurry up Mister Microwave.
I'm hungry.

158
00:08:55,817 --> 00:08:57,942
[beeping]

159
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:03,608
Awww!

160
00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:04,733
[SHIRO]
Is it done?

161
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:06,858
[KOENJI laughs]
Sure is!

162
00:09:06,942 --> 00:09:08,108
[SENKO, SHIRO gasping]

163
00:09:08,192 --> 00:09:10,150
[SENKO]
It really is cooked!

164
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:13,233
[KOENJI]
And it smells amazing!

165
00:09:13,317 --> 00:09:16,192
Well! Let's taste it to be sure!

166
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:20,733
I'm so excited!

167
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:27,567
[laughs]

168
00:09:30,275 --> 00:09:33,942
Then I shall have
a bite, as well!

169
00:09:34,025 --> 00:09:35,150
Mm?

170
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:39,983
All right, here I go!

171
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:46,025
It tastes great!

172
00:09:46,108 --> 00:09:48,275
Everything is so warm and melty!

173
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:49,775
I never knew that
this cheese stuff

174
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:51,942
would be so utterly delicious!

175
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,400
You're really having a special
moment with that food,

176
00:09:54,483 --> 00:09:56,608
I understand those
feels completely.

177
00:09:56,692 --> 00:09:58,650
This is great for
your first attempt.

178
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:00,025
Not that I'm surprised.

179
00:10:00,108 --> 00:10:03,692
Your husband's gonna be in
for a real treat, Senko!

180
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:06,317
Uh-huh. Now that
I know the recipe,

181
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,275
I can cook him cheese
gratin whenever he desires.

182
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,817
And you couldn't have
done it without my help!

183
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,442
Yes, you're a very good
special helper, Shiro.

184
00:10:14,525 --> 00:10:16,108
Way to go...

185
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:23,608
Oh wow, thanks for
doing the dishes.

186
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:26,108
No, if anything I should
be thanking you.

187
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,900
[KOENJI laughs]

188
00:10:27,983 --> 00:10:31,275
[KOENJI] Whoa. I can
literally see it sparkling.

189
00:10:31,358 --> 00:10:33,775
Your lesson was
extremely educational.

190
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:36,692
And I really enjoyed cooking
with the two of you.

191
00:10:36,775 --> 00:10:39,650
[KOENJI] I mean, all I
did was read a recipe.

192
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:42,650
I was able to make it
because you taught me how.

193
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:46,025
So, would you maybe cook
with me again sometime?

194
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:49,442
[gasping] Yes, of course!

195
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:54,942
[SHIRO] Heh! What about me?
I wanna help with something!

196
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:57,358
You can be in charge
of eating, Shiro.

197
00:10:57,442 --> 00:10:58,608
Good idea.

198
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,817
[SHIRO] I can also be
in charge of the fire!

199
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,567
Yes, that's true, too.

200
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,817
[SENKO laughs]

201
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,858
[GIRLS laughing]

202
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:13,942
[NAKANO]
Whoa... This looks good!

203
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:16,067
Go ahead and try some.

204
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:25,650
So, how is it?

205
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:30,150
It's amazing! I've been craving
cheese gratin for a while.

206
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:33,942
Wonderful! When you're
happy, then I'm happy!

207
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:38,233
[NAKANO] I didn't know that you
could also make western food.

208
00:11:38,317 --> 00:11:41,150
[SENKO] Yes, Koenji was kind
enough to teach me how.

209
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,983
Oh, I see.

210
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:45,692
Hm? What's this?

211
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:48,900
You even found a way to use
your famous fried-tofu.

212
00:11:48,983 --> 00:11:51,483
Oh, I actually added a couple
of secret ingredients,

213
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:54,483
like white miso, ginger,
and a few other things.

214
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:57,483
[NAKANO]
Ah. That explains it, then.

215
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:00,317
Even though it's
western-style food,

216
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,233
it still tastes just
like your cooking.

217
00:12:02,317 --> 00:12:03,400
[gasps]

218
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,817
[SENKO]
That flavor... is my love.

219
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,608
My favorite seasoning.

220
00:12:12,692 --> 00:12:13,983
Huh?

221
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,442
[laughing]

222
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:17,025
Well, that makes sense.

223
00:12:17,108 --> 00:12:19,650
No wonder your cooking
always tastes so good.

224
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:22,108
Of course. It's one reason.

225
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:24,358
[NAKANO, SENKO laugh]

226
00:12:27,858 --> 00:12:30,275
Hey, guess what?
I made you some dinner.

227
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:31,775
[KOENJI]
For real?!

228
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,108
That's instant ramen!

229
00:12:36,192 --> 00:12:37,608
Yeah, so what?

230
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:40,358
I'll have you know I heated
the water with my own fire!

231
00:12:40,442 --> 00:12:41,817
[KOENJI]
If you say so.

232
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,358
Thanks Shiro, that's
very thoughtful of you.

233
00:12:45,442 --> 00:12:47,192
'Kay, here I go.

234
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:50,567
It's sweet?

235
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,817
I seasoned it with my
favorite ingredient: sugar!

236
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,317
[KOENJI] I think you and I
have different tastes.

237
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,358
[NAKANO]
I'm home.

238
00:13:06,442 --> 00:13:09,025
[SENKO]
Welcome back.

239
00:13:09,108 --> 00:13:10,525
Thanks for working hard today.

240
00:13:10,608 --> 00:13:12,150
Yeah, of course.

241
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:19,483
[sighs] Coming home to an
air-conditioned apartment

242
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:21,108
is the best.

243
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:23,483
[SENKO] Things are much
easier than they used to be.

244
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:25,983
Man, it sucks when the
stuffy weather continues

245
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:27,817
into the fall season like this.

246
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,650
Oh, here.

247
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:30,775
Thank you so much, Senko.

248
00:13:30,858 --> 00:13:32,442
I'm sure wearing
this heavy jacket

249
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:35,025
when it's hot outside
must be like utter torture.

250
00:13:35,108 --> 00:13:37,567
Even looking at it
makes me feel sweaty.

251
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,192
It's not that I don't
agree with you,

252
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:40,733
but it's part of our
office dress code,

253
00:13:40,817 --> 00:13:42,650
so there's not much
I can really do.

254
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:45,067
[SENKO] Huh? Your hair
has gotten very long,

255
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,692
perhaps that is making
you hot as well!

256
00:13:47,775 --> 00:13:50,567
I'm definitely overdue for
a trim, that's for sure.

257
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,067
But I've been so busy I haven't
had the time to get one.

258
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,442
That's unfortunate,
but it is an easy fix.

259
00:13:56,525 --> 00:13:57,483
Huh?

260
00:13:58,858 --> 00:14:01,275
I shall be the one
to cut your hair!

261
00:14:01,358 --> 00:14:02,650
Wait, right here at home?

262
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:05,442
Yep! It's no problem at all!

263
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:08,525
I'm an excellent hair dresser.

264
00:14:08,608 --> 00:14:10,233
Yeah, I dunno, Senko.

265
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,275
I'm not really into
the samurai look.

266
00:14:12,358 --> 00:14:15,192
[SENKO] Don't worry,
I'm not that old-fashioned.

267
00:14:15,275 --> 00:14:17,817
And besides, I've thought you
were in need of a haircut

268
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,858
for a while now. So,
I did lots of research.

269
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:24,150
Oh, that's cool. You probably
know way more than I do.

270
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:27,067
Okay then, let's commence
with operation haircut!

271
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,275
[SENKO]
Right!

272
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:36,858
Okay, ready to get started?

273
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,483
Go for it.

274
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:49,525
[NAKANO] She seems pretty
comfortable with this.

275
00:14:49,608 --> 00:14:52,108
I should relax and
let her do her thing.

276
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:54,483
[scissors snipping]

277
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:55,858
[gasps]

278
00:14:55,942 --> 00:14:57,858
Is there a reason why you
sound shocked right now?

279
00:14:57,942 --> 00:15:01,317
Oh. These just happen to be
incredibly sharp scissors.

280
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,858
[NAKANO]
All I need is a little trim,

281
00:15:02,942 --> 00:15:04,483
not a whole new style, kay?

282
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:06,608
[SENKO]
I know, dearest.

283
00:15:06,692 --> 00:15:09,317
Trust me, it's going to be fine.

284
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,442
[NAKANO laughs]

285
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:12,358
All right. Then trim away!

286
00:15:12,442 --> 00:15:15,025
Uh! Just leave it to me!

287
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:18,150
Okay. I'm starting,
so don't move.

288
00:15:21,108 --> 00:15:22,692
What do you think?

289
00:15:23,983 --> 00:15:26,983
[gasps] We'll try
something else.

290
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:28,317
And... voila!

291
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,817
[NAKANO]
Mm. Mm-mm.

292
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,275
Wha--? No go, huh?
This one, then.

293
00:15:33,358 --> 00:15:35,192
[NAKANO grumbles]

294
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:37,067
[NAKANO] Does Senko think
I'm quitting my job

295
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,942
and joining a band?

296
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,775
I'm only teasing!

297
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:46,317
Don't worry, I promise
I'll be more serious now.

298
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,317
[sighs] Thank goodness.

299
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:57,275
[scissors snipping]

300
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,442
[snipping continues]

301
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:11,733
[NAKANO] The relaxing sound
of scissors snipping.

302
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:16,025
It feels like I've completely
surrendered myself to her.

303
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:19,192
Mm... It reminds me...

304
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,650
[NAKANO]
When I was a kid,

305
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:29,900
I think my mom used to
cut my hair like this.

306
00:16:29,983 --> 00:16:31,858
[SENKO humming]

307
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:34,483
[laughs]

308
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:39,817
[SENKO humming]

309
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:50,775
Hey. I'm all finished;
it's time to wake up.

310
00:16:50,858 --> 00:16:51,900
Uh.

311
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:58,400
Oh, wow! It's so much
lighter than it was before.

312
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:00,025
It must feel very nice.

313
00:17:00,108 --> 00:17:03,650
It does, thank you. Oh,
I'm sorry that I dozed off.

314
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:07,025
It's all right! You must have
been pretty exhausted.

315
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:12,317
[NAKANO] Aw man, I didn't
realize I had so much hair.

316
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,692
I know, but you also went a
long time without cutting it.

317
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,108
[laughs]

318
00:17:18,192 --> 00:17:21,025
Anyway, I should probably go
and wash my hair real quick.

319
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:22,775
Whoa there. Wait a second.

320
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:25,817
After all, the fun
is only beginning.

321
00:17:32,108 --> 00:17:34,275
[NAKANO]
Mm... Hold on just a minute,

322
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:36,817
I think we might be taking this
"at-home-barbershop" thing

323
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,400
a little bit too far, Senko!

324
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:39,817
How so?

325
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,692
[NAKANO] I'm more than capable
of washing my own hair!

326
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:46,608
All right. Would this make
it less objectionable?

327
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:47,858
[NAKANO grunting]

328
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:52,108
Leave everything to me, 'kay?

329
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:04,150
Ready for the shampooing?

330
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:05,608
[NAKANO]
Yeah.

331
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:16,692
[NAKANO] Oh, man.
I've had my hair washed before,

332
00:18:16,775 --> 00:18:18,983
but it's never felt this good.

333
00:18:19,817 --> 00:18:21,608
[NAKANO gasping]

334
00:18:21,692 --> 00:18:24,608
[NAKANO] Senko's tiny fingers
are so soft and warm.

335
00:18:24,692 --> 00:18:27,317
They're gentle, but also
firm when necessary.

336
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,900
Like she's massaging
away all my stress.

337
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,358
Let me know if I miss any spots.

338
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:34,025
[NAKANO]
Okay.

339
00:18:34,108 --> 00:18:37,358
[NAKANO] Her fluffy tail
laying gently on my face.

340
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:40,858
It's totally diffusing
my negative thoughts.

341
00:18:40,942 --> 00:18:44,858
She's doing more than
just washing my hair.

342
00:18:44,942 --> 00:18:47,608
[gasping]

343
00:18:50,108 --> 00:18:52,775
[NAKANO]
She's washing away all my cares!

344
00:18:52,858 --> 00:18:55,775
My troubles are just
disappearing!

345
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:02,858
Thanks so much, Senko!

346
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,067
My head feels
completely clear, now!

347
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,317
You can wash my hair
anytime you want to.

348
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,400
It makes me very happy that
you enjoyed it so much.

349
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,567
I was only copying what I saw,

350
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,150
but I'm really glad
that I was able

351
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:16,608
to make you look so handsome.

352
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:19,233
Uh? Hold on, what
did you just say?

353
00:19:19,317 --> 00:19:20,733
You only copied what you saw?

354
00:19:20,817 --> 00:19:21,608
[SENKO gasps]

355
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:23,317
What is that supposed to mean?

356
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,067
Well, uh... Oh.

357
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,067
That may or may not
have been my first time

358
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,275
using scissors and cutting
more modern hair.

359
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:31,733
Wait, your first time?

360
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:33,192
But how could it be your first?

361
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:35,400
You seemed so confident
when we started.

362
00:19:35,483 --> 00:19:36,942
Yeah, and it was successful!

363
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:38,442
Your hair came out wonderfully,

364
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:40,900
and I was able to reconnect
the part I where messed up.

365
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:43,025
Whoa, reconnect what now?

366
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:46,233
[gasps]

367
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,317
[sighs]

368
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:57,692
Please tell me that you're
just teasing me again.

369
00:19:57,775 --> 00:19:59,233
Is it super obvious?

370
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:01,400
There's no need to worry
about it so much,

371
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:02,983
the hair that I reattached
should last

372
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:04,275
for about two or three days.

373
00:20:04,358 --> 00:20:06,317
What?! Hold on, what
happens after three days?

374
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,400
It's hard to know.
Only the gods can say.

375
00:20:09,483 --> 00:20:10,817
[NAKANO]
Huh?

376
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,192
I'm teasing, the hair will
remain there permanently.

377
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:15,650
[sighs]

378
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:17,858
Oh well, I guess it would
have grown out eventually,

379
00:20:17,942 --> 00:20:19,942
so a mistake wouldn't
have been a huge deal.

380
00:20:20,025 --> 00:20:21,275
And when it gets too long,

381
00:20:21,358 --> 00:20:23,317
I shall be more than
happy to cut it for you.

382
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,733
No thanks, I'll pass. Next time
I'll go to a real barber.

383
00:20:26,817 --> 00:20:27,942
Say what?!

384
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:29,442
[SENKO whimpers]

385
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:30,317
[NAKANO]
Mm?

386
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,775
[whines]

387
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:33,817
[laughing]

388
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,275
I'm just kidding.

389
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:38,400
You are? Oh, you really got me.

390
00:20:38,483 --> 00:20:40,692
[NAKANO]
I had to get you back somehow.

391
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:44,567
[SENKO]
I should thank you.

392
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,733
Huh?

393
00:20:45,817 --> 00:20:47,317
In the short time
that I've known you,

394
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,942
I've tried a lot of new
and different things.

395
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:52,358
And I've had so much fun.

396
00:20:58,567 --> 00:21:00,400
[NAKANO]
Me too, Senko.

397
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,483
[SENKO]
Super Senko Time!

398
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,525
Hi, welcome back!

399
00:22:40,608 --> 00:22:43,733
You seem to be getting home
a little later than usual.

400
00:22:43,817 --> 00:22:45,942
You must have worked
really hard today.

401
00:22:46,025 --> 00:22:49,483
Have you had a chance
to eat any dinner, yet?

402
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:50,775
Oh, no!

403
00:22:50,858 --> 00:22:54,483
You must be on the
verge of starvation!

404
00:22:54,567 --> 00:22:57,192
Wait, you'd rather go straight
to bed without eating?

405
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,775
But if you go to sleep now,
then you might wake up hungry

406
00:22:59,858 --> 00:23:02,108
in the middle of the night
because you skipped your dinner.

407
00:23:02,192 --> 00:23:04,233
I know, what if I made
you a little snack?

408
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:07,358
It'll only take me
a couple of minutes.

409
00:23:07,442 --> 00:23:08,858
Okay!

410
00:23:09,442 --> 00:23:10,775
All right, here you are!

411
00:23:10,858 --> 00:23:13,108
This is my Special Fox Udon!

412
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:15,067
I put some sweetly fried tofu

413
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,442
and delicious white
leeks on the top.

414
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:20,442
Are you feeling more hungry?

415
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,942
Well good, I'm happy to hear it!

416
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:24,442
I was hoping that
you would be able

417
00:23:24,525 --> 00:23:26,858
to eat something a little
sooner in the evening,

418
00:23:26,942 --> 00:23:29,358
but I understand that
you had to work late.

419
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:32,317
If eating my food will make you
feel a little bit better though,

420
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,608
then it's well worth the wait!

421
00:23:34,692 --> 00:23:39,358
Now, you need to eat it quickly
or else it'll get cold!

422
00:23:39,442 --> 00:23:42,692
Thank you so much for all
your hard work today.

423
00:23:42,775 --> 00:23:45,150
Goodnight and sweet dreams!
