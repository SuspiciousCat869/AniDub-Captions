00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:16,692
[door opens]

2
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:18,608
[NAKANO]
I'm home...

3
00:00:19,442 --> 00:00:21,608
Yay, I'm so glad you're back!

4
00:00:21,692 --> 00:00:23,358
[exhales]

5
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:24,692
[SENKO]
Oh, my!

6
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,733
You look even more worn
down than you usually do!

7
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:29,275
Sure, that makes
me feel better.

8
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:31,108
Well, at least
tomorrow is Sunday!

9
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:33,442
Now you can finally
rest a little bit.

10
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:35,025
Oh.

11
00:00:35,108 --> 00:00:37,858
The thing is, I actually have
to go into the office tomorrow.

12
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:39,692
[SENKO]
You do?! But why though?

13
00:00:39,775 --> 00:00:41,650
I don't understand why
you must go into work

14
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:43,608
on your only day off!

15
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:49,150
You know. I don't
understand it, either.

16
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:51,733
[SENKO]
Your work must be terrible!

17
00:02:25,525 --> 00:02:27,025
[SENKO]
If you keep working this much,

18
00:02:27,108 --> 00:02:29,483
I'm certain it will
be the end of you.

19
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,692
Can you not take time off?

20
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:34,733
[NAKANO] There are people who
have to work way more than I do.

21
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:37,275
But that has nothing
to do with my complaint.

22
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,192
It sucks, but it'll be okay.

23
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:40,650
Thanks to all your help,

24
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:43,150
I've been able to relax a
lot more than usual lately.

25
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:44,692
[SENKO grumbles]

26
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:47,650
I do have to be careful that I
don't accidentally sleep in.

27
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:50,108
Better set my alarm
before I forget.

28
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,442
Yes, well, I've been
thinking about that.

29
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:59,025
Is it not difficult to be awoken
by such a crude sound?

30
00:02:59,108 --> 00:03:00,275
That's it!

31
00:03:00,358 --> 00:03:02,567
I've just had the
most wonderful idea!

32
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,525
I shall gently awaken
you in the morning

33
00:03:04,608 --> 00:03:06,858
using my tender love and care!

34
00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:09,942
Yeah, okay. But you do have
to actually wake me up.

35
00:03:10,025 --> 00:03:11,025
[SENKO]
Yes, of course!

36
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,692
Are you insinuating
that I wouldn't?

37
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:15,983
I promise you have
nothing to worry about!

38
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:18,650
Us old folks are great
at waking up early!

39
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:20,733
That's an old person thing?

40
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:24,775
Well... It's something
that I do, anyway.

41
00:03:24,858 --> 00:03:25,983
[NAKANO]
You're like an old woman

42
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:27,942
and a little girl combined.

43
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,233
Okay, then.

44
00:03:31,317 --> 00:03:34,983
I officially dub thee my alarm
for tomorrow morning.

45
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:36,442
Got it!

46
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:40,483
Man, I'm wiped.

47
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:43,775
[SENKO]
Are you okay?!

48
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:02,692
Fluffy fluff.

49
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,733
So soft.

50
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,525
[SENKO]
My goodness.

51
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:09,108
He's so stubborn.

52
00:04:09,192 --> 00:04:11,900
He really fights being pampered.

53
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:16,317
But somehow all that
makes him even cuter.

54
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:26,733
[SENKO yawns]

55
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:28,067
Whew!

56
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,858
The weather outside is
simply gorgeous today!

57
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,650
It's perfect for
drying the laundry!

58
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:44,650
Oh. That's right,
I almost forgot,

59
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:47,942
I promised I would be
his alarm clock today.

60
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,775
[SENKO] He looks so peaceful
when he's sleeping.

61
00:04:54,858 --> 00:04:57,233
It almost seems cruel
to wake him up.

62
00:04:57,317 --> 00:04:59,275
But it must be done!

63
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:06,400
Wakey, wakey. It's morning.
Time to greet the day.

64
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:07,317
Uh...

65
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,317
Wha... I...

66
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,858
C'mon, out of bed, sleepyhead!

67
00:05:12,942 --> 00:05:17,817
Yeah. But... I just
wanna keep sleeping.

68
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,150
Uh.

69
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,775
I know, but you told me
you have things to do today.

70
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:28,525
Uh. But five more minutes.

71
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:30,025
All right then.

72
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:33,108
Per your request, I shall wake
you again in five minutes.

73
00:05:33,192 --> 00:05:35,067
[NAKANO]
Hooray.

74
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,275
Thank you, Senko.

75
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:47,900
[SENKO]
Hold on just a moment.

76
00:05:47,983 --> 00:05:52,317
Could it be the mornings
actually make him weak?

77
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,525
He's usually so resistant
when I try to pamper him.

78
00:05:55,608 --> 00:05:57,442
This is my chance!

79
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:58,733
Hey.

80
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:02,108
Didn't I have to go into
work today or something?

81
00:06:04,192 --> 00:06:05,942
[SENKO]
You always work so hard,

82
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:08,150
even on the days you
should have off.

83
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:09,608
That's true.

84
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:11,942
Work's stupid,
and I don't wanna go.

85
00:06:12,025 --> 00:06:13,317
I want more sleep.

86
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,900
Then why don't you stay home
and relax a little bit?

87
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:18,108
[NAKANO grunts]

88
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:23,067
[SENKO]
Wow. This is great!

89
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,400
Things are so much easier

90
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:27,525
when he just gives in
and lets me spoil him!

91
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:31,983
Ugh. I should probably
get out of bed already.

92
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:34,233
But it's Sunday, remember?

93
00:06:34,317 --> 00:06:37,483
There's no need to get up
or work on your day off.

94
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,483
That's a fair point.

95
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:42,692
Not to mention, it's important
for you to get plenty of rest.

96
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:44,067
True...

97
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,317
It's healthy to sleep
all day sometimes!

98
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
In fact, I'll go back to sleep!

99
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:54,358
Let's indulge in the
extra rest together!

100
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:56,275
Huh...

101
00:06:56,358 --> 00:06:58,817
Here, I'll even let you
cuddle with my tail!

102
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,358
Go ahead and fluff it
all you want!

103
00:07:01,442 --> 00:07:03,108
[NAKANO]
Fluffy-fluff?

104
00:07:03,817 --> 00:07:05,400
[SENKO]
Mm-hm!

105
00:07:05,483 --> 00:07:08,400
Man, I wanna bury
my face right in it.

106
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:12,858
Please do!

107
00:07:25,983 --> 00:07:28,817
[chopping]

108
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:37,442
[NAKANO]
Crap! Why is it so late?

109
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:40,025
How long have I been asleep?

110
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:41,400
Oh, man...

111
00:07:41,483 --> 00:07:44,525
There's no way I can
just go into work now.

112
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:47,025
At this point, the day's
practically already over.

113
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:49,317
[SENKO]
Are you awake?

114
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,358
You were sleeping pretty deeply.
Just like a lil' baby.

115
00:07:53,442 --> 00:07:54,983
[NAKANO]
Uhh...

116
00:07:58,775 --> 00:08:02,442
Y-You know, earlier, I didn't
know what I was doing!

117
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:05,150
I wish you would act
that way more often.

118
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:08,983
[NAKANO] Yeah, well...
I wouldn't bet on it.

119
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:11,525
Can we just forget
about this morning?

120
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:12,525
No way!

121
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:14,358
C'mon, pretty please?

122
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:15,817
[SENKO]
Not a chance!

123
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,483
There's nothing wrong
with how you acted.

124
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,983
You're biased. Doesn't matter.

125
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,483
Tomorrow things
go back to normal.

126
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:26,358
I don't understand.

127
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:29,567
Well, I have to make up
for slacking off today.

128
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,692
Both at my job and as
a person in general.

129
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:33,733
[SENKO]
Do you really?

130
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:34,817
Uh.

131
00:08:40,442 --> 00:08:42,525
Please don't push yourself.

132
00:08:42,608 --> 00:08:44,067
'Kay.

133
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,317
Right. Do not fret,

134
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,442
for tomorrow I shall be sure
to wake you up properly!

135
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:50,983
No, that's okay.

136
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:53,983
Wait. I promise that it won't
be a repeat of this morning.

137
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:57,692
Really, it's something I can
probably manage by myself.

138
00:08:57,775 --> 00:09:00,900
[SENKO] But I won't let
you go back to sleep!

139
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:03,400
[NAKANO]
Your eyes are creepy.

140
00:09:03,483 --> 00:09:04,608
No they're not!

141
00:09:04,692 --> 00:09:06,442
--[NAKANO] Heh.
--[SENKO grumbles]

142
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:07,733
[SENKO]
Hm?

143
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:10,233
Uh?!

144
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,608
Look, you don't need to rely
on that noisy contraption,

145
00:09:12,692 --> 00:09:14,775
I'm going to do my very best
to wake you up tomorrow

146
00:09:14,858 --> 00:09:18,608
so please leave
everything to me, okay?

147
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,233
Fine, if you insist.

148
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:21,650
Excellent!

149
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:27,608
[NAKANO] I'm going to do
my best tomorrow, too.

150
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,608
So, can I maybe fluff your
tail a little bit more?

151
00:09:30,692 --> 00:09:34,150
[SENKO] I think you've done than
more than enough for one day.

152
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,650
[SENKO humming]

153
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:50,025
Senko, Hey.
Is that fox fire your using?

154
00:09:50,108 --> 00:09:52,275
Yep! That's right.

155
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,150
[NAKANO]
Not a fan of the stove, huh?

156
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:55,817
No, it's not that.

157
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,733
I'm sure the stove works fine.

158
00:09:57,817 --> 00:10:03,233
But I prefer fox fire, because
then I can control the flame.

159
00:10:03,317 --> 00:10:06,025
[NAKANO] I've noticed it makes
a great night-light, as well.

160
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:08,150
[SENKO]

00:18:06,608 --> 00:18:08,692
[KOENJI]
What's goin' on?

321
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:12,067
What do I press
to turn it all off?

322
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,067
Is it this one?

323
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,567
Or this one? Or this one?

324
00:18:20,358 --> 00:18:22,233
[laughing]

325
00:18:22,317 --> 00:18:24,733
That's enough! Stop it!

326
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:27,275
I command you!

327
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,442
[gasps]

328
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,192
Weird, I guess she's okay.

329
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:41,275
I'm home.

330
00:18:41,358 --> 00:18:44,108
Huh? Uh, Senko?

331
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:45,442
[light switch clicking]

332
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:48,275
[NAKANO]
The lights won't turn on.

333
00:18:48,358 --> 00:18:50,025
Hey, Senko?

334
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:58,275
What the heck?
What on earth happened to you?

335
00:18:58,358 --> 00:19:00,400
Please forgive me, I...

336
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:03,275
I really am nothing
but a dumb floof-ball.

337
00:19:03,358 --> 00:19:06,317
[NAKANO] I'm confused,
why are you sitting in the dark?

338
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,067
[SENKO] All of the machines got
really loud and stopped working.

339
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,733
Just try and settle down.

340
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,858
I'm sure everything's fine.

341
00:19:16,358 --> 00:19:19,608
See, the breaker tripped.
Nothing to worry about.

342
00:19:21,317 --> 00:19:23,067
[SENKO grumbles]
Right.

343
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,900
Uh. I am concerned
about any food

344
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:27,692
we had in the fridge, though.

345
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:31,942
Good, it looks like
everything survived.

346
00:19:32,025 --> 00:19:33,483
[SENKO]
Yes.

347
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:36,400
But we should probably cook the
meat tonight, just to be safe.

348
00:19:36,483 --> 00:19:37,608
[NAKANO]
True.

349
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:39,775
Better check the stuff
in the freezer, too.

350
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,025
[NAKANO]
Whoa!

351
00:19:43,108 --> 00:19:45,358
It's like some kind
of fried-tofu stash.

352
00:19:45,442 --> 00:19:47,817
[SENKO] I guess we'll have
to cook all these, as well.

353
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,400
Uh. Like all of it, all of it?

354
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:52,983
[SENKO]
I am ashamed.

355
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:56,275
I can't believe I have managed
to cause you so much trouble.

356
00:20:00,483 --> 00:20:03,108
[NAKANO] Cheer up,
it's not that big of a deal.

357
00:20:03,192 --> 00:20:04,483
[SENKO]
Uh?

358
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:06,025
Besides...

359
00:20:07,692 --> 00:20:10,900
Just seeing your smiling
face is more than enough.

360
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:13,192
It always brightens my mood.

361
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:23,442
My goodness.

362
00:20:24,317 --> 00:20:26,108
That moment would have
been much more tender

363
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:28,108
without the tail
touching, you know.

364
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:30,358
This also brightens my mood.

365
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,483
[SENKO]
Oh, no.

366
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:36,525
It looks like the rice
never finished cooking.

367
00:20:36,608 --> 00:20:38,608
Do you feel like
eating rice porridge?

368
00:20:38,692 --> 00:20:40,942
Yeah that sounds really good.

369
00:20:41,025 --> 00:20:43,900
[SENKO] All right!
I'll have it ready in no time!

370
00:20:43,983 --> 00:20:45,775
Cool.

371
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:47,733
[SHIRO]
Hmph. What is Sen doing?

372
00:20:47,817 --> 00:20:50,233
She made such a big deal
about going to help Nakano,

373
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:53,900
only to go and screw it up!
I can't believe her.

374
00:20:53,983 --> 00:20:57,067
[YOZORA exhales]
Indeed. I fear at this rate,

375
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,358
we won't be able to rid the
young sir of his darkness.

376
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:03,233
Well then, there is
no other choice!

377
00:21:03,317 --> 00:21:08,483
I, the great Shiro, will have
to go and pamper him myself!

378
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,692
To his heart's content.

379
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,108
[SENKO]
Super Senko Time!

380
00:22:48,692 --> 00:22:50,317
Hello, welcome home!

381
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,858
Oh my, it looks as though
you've had another long day.

382
00:22:53,942 --> 00:22:57,942
[gasps] You poor dear, you seem
a little more tired than usual.

383
00:22:58,025 --> 00:23:01,733
At times like this, it's best to
try and go to sleep a bit early.

384
00:23:01,817 --> 00:23:05,150
Actually, I was thinkin' about
heading to bed early myself!

385
00:23:06,275 --> 00:23:08,275
[SENKO]
Can't fall asleep?

386
00:23:10,942 --> 00:23:12,817
Well okay, then. How's this?

387
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,233
You can always fluff up
my tail if you want to.

388
00:23:16,317 --> 00:23:17,275
Better?

389
00:23:17,358 --> 00:23:20,067
Do you feel like
you're tired yet?

390
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:26,692
You're not? You still can't
fall asleep, can you?

391
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:28,108
Let me see.

392
00:23:28,192 --> 00:23:30,692
If you would like, I can
sing a lullaby just for you.

393
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:33,358
All right, go on and
close your eyes.

394
00:23:33,442 --> 00:23:36,108
♪ Rock a bye baby,
in the tree top, ♪

395
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:40,400
♪ when the wind blows
the cradle will rock ♪

396
00:23:40,483 --> 00:23:41,733
Sleep tight.

397
00:23:41,817 --> 00:23:44,483
And as always, sweet dreams.
