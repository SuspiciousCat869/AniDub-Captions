But I've been practicing
day and night.

00:12:10.798 --> 00:12:12.366 position:21% line:83% align:start

the crossbar,

three days to heal.

And how would you know
something like that?!

00:13:27.007 --> 00:13:29.076 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, you know. I get to
read a lot of books

00:13:29.109 --> 00:13:32.079 position:21% line:83% align:start
when I'm on the train
because of my father's job.

00:13:32.112 --> 00:13:34.148 position:10% line:83% align:start
And I just read a great book
about soccer

00:13:34.181 --> 00:13:36.817 position:24% line:83% align:start
that had first-aid
techniques in it.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:38.152 position:30% line:83% align:start
-About soccer?
-Yeah!

00:13:38.886 --> 00:13:40.755 position:10% line:89% align:start
But what are we going to do?

00:13:40.789 --> 00:13:44.024 position:33% line:83% align:start
We're already
barely 11 players.

00:13:44.058 --> 00:13:46.894 position:21% line:89% align:start
What? Ryo is injured?

00:13:46.927 --> 00:13:48.763 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yeah, can anyone
play soccer?

00:13:48.797 --> 00:13:51.899 position:21% line:83% align:start
Is there anyone here
that can play soccer?

00:13:51.932 --> 00:13:54.602 position:30% line:83% align:start
Me play soccer?
Nah, I can't.

00:13:54.636 --> 00:13:55.737 position:33% line:83% align:start
Yeah, me too.
I have two left feet.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.338 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I don't know if I can.
-All right...

00:13:57.371 --> 00:13:58.872 position:19% line:89% align:start
Then I'm going to play!

00:13:58.906 --> 00:13:59.940 position:24% line:83% align:start
-What's that, Boss?
-What's that, Boss?

00:13:59.973 --> 00:14:01.108 position:30% line:89% align:start
If I'll do it,

00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:03.944 position:21% line:83% align:start
then I'll get to play
soccer with Tsubasa!

-Uh...
-Uh...

00:14:05.245 --> 00:14:07.181 position:19% line:83% align:start

-Huh?

00:14:07.214 --> 00:14:09.416 position:30% line:83% align:start

will play then!

-No, I will play.
-Humph.

00:14:10.984 --> 00:14:12.654 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll be way more useful
than him!

00:14:12.687 --> 00:14:15.824 position:10% line:83% align:start

Nankatsu and Shutetsu,

00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:17.858 position:19% line:83% align:start

[Hajime] Captain,
where are you going?

00:14:24.365 --> 00:14:25.667 position:35% line:89% align:start
I told you.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.235 position:19% line:83% align:start
This match was between
me and Tsubasa

00:14:28.268 --> 00:14:30.638 position:24% line:83% align:start
to see if he could
steal a goal from me.

00:14:32.206 --> 00:14:33.006 position:35% line:89% align:start
And I've...

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.275 position:33% line:83% align:start
clearly lost
that match today.

00:14:35.309 --> 00:14:37.878 position:30% line:83% align:start
You can handle
the overtime yourselves.

made you captain.

Be careful, guys!

00:21:17.745 --> 00:21:20.815 position:13% line:83% align:start
You shouldn't take lightly
Shutetsu's set play!

00:21:24.018 --> 00:21:24.986 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:25.853 --> 00:21:27.054 position:33% line:89% align:start
C-Captain...?

00:21:27.088 --> 00:21:27.855 position:33% line:89% align:start
Here, Hajime!

Captain,
with the time remaining,

00:22:00.621 --> 00:22:02.156 position:33% line:83% align:start
we could try
the birdcage...

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.225 position:19% line:83% align:start
I got it. You sure like
the birdcage...

00:22:04.258 --> 00:22:05.827 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:06.794 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's enough.

00:22:06.828 --> 00:22:09.864 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's just a tactic
to run away.

00:22:09.897 --> 00:22:12.233 position:21% line:83% align:start
Instead of defending
the points we have,

00:22:12.266 --> 00:22:15.069 position:27% line:83% align:start
why not fight for
another one to win!

00:22:15.102 --> 00:22:16.436 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Yes, Captain!
-Yes, Captain!

00:22:16.469 --> 00:22:17.972 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa]
Amazing!

00:22:18.005 --> 00:22:19.907 position:16% line:89% align:start
Genzo is really amazing!

00:22:20.641 --> 00:22:22.409 position:13% line:89% align:start
But the match is not over.

00:22:22.442 --> 00:22:24.444 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now it is our turn, guys!

00:22:24.477 --> 00:22:25.513 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

00:22:26.346 --> 00:22:28.316 position:27% line:83% align:start
 <i>I won't let them</i>
 <i>say that we lost</i>

00:22:28.348 --> 00:22:29.884 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>since I joined the team!</i>

00:22:30.785 --> 00:22:33.988 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right!
It's time to strike back!
