 <i>of kids on a soccer field.</i>

00:00:16.985 --> 00:00:19.319 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>There, he is witness to</i>
 <i>an epic challenge</i>

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:22.422 position:21% line:83% align:start

00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:25.225 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>and the captains of</i>
 <i>several different sports.</i>

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.662 position:27% line:83% align:start
 <i>Every single one</i>
 <i>tried their best</i>

00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:29.229 position:13% line:89% align:start
 <i>to score a goal on Genzo.</i>

00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:31.365 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>But it was impossible</i>
 <i>to defeat him.</i>

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:33.568 position:33% line:83% align:start
 <i>After seeing</i>
 <i>his incredible skills,</i>

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:37.471 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>Tsubasa decides to send</i>
 <i>Genzo a challenge...</i>

00:00:37.505 --> 00:00:40.440 position:19% line:83% align:start
So Genzo... What do you
have to say now?

00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:44.344 position:13% line:83% align:start
This right here is the kid
that challenged you earlier.

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:45.747 position:24% line:83% align:start
What are you trying
to pull, huh?

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.948 position:21% line:83% align:start
You really expect me
to believe

00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:49.717 position:21% line:83% align:start
that a kid like that
has such a power kick?

00:00:49.751 --> 00:00:51.485 position:10% line:89% align:start
Let's settle this right now.

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.655 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you really want
to challenge me...

00:00:53.688 --> 00:00:55.957 position:30% line:89% align:start
then let's go!

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.626 position:35% line:83% align:start
Watch out!
Get out of the way!

[narrator] <i>It seems destiny</i>
 <i>had something in store</i>

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:08.970 position:30% line:83% align:start
 <i>for these two</i>
 <i>soccer players.</i>

00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:12.807 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>Now Tsubasa and Genzo will</i>
 <i>face off against each other.</i>

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:21.816 position:27% line:83% align:start
What do you have
to say now, Genzo?

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:24.786 position:13% line:83% align:start
So now you understand what
I was talking about earlier?

00:01:31.793 --> 00:01:33.027 position:21% line:89% align:start
So what's up, Genzo?

00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:35.095 position:30% line:83% align:start
Will you accept
my challenge?

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:38.131 position:38% line:83% align:start
Tell me,
why are you doing this?

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:39.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
He was there during
the challenge you had

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:41.769 position:27% line:83% align:start
with the captains
from all the other sports

00:01:41.803 --> 00:01:43.203 position:16% line:89% align:start
and was really impressed.

00:01:43.972 --> 00:01:45.573 position:38% line:83% align:start
And now,
you're challenging me?

00:01:46.774 --> 00:01:48.175 position:35% line:83% align:start
[player 1]
Captain!

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:49.309 position:21% line:89% align:start
How's it going, guys?

00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:50.578 position:21% line:89% align:start
What's going on here?

00:01:50.612 --> 00:01:53.313 position:30% line:83% align:start
Didn't you say
you were going home?

00:01:53.347 --> 00:01:54.949 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey, guys, perfect timing.

00:01:54.983 --> 00:01:55.215 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:59.252 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll admit, this little guy
has a very powerful kick.

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:00.454 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Genzo]
But it's a big mistake

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:02.757 position:10% line:83% align:start
to think he can challenge me
in a soccer field

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.491 position:27% line:83% align:start
-just with that.
-Say what?

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:06.393 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you really want
to challenge me,

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:09.697 position:24% line:83% align:start
you'll need to get
past them first!

00:02:09.731 --> 00:02:11.231 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Say what?

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:13.001 position:27% line:83% align:start
Once you dribble
past them,

00:02:13.034 --> 00:02:14.602 position:21% line:89% align:start
then you can face me!

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:01.642 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[narrator] <i>Episode 2:</i>

00:04:01.676 --> 00:04:03.644 position:30% line:83% align:start
 <i>-He's Flying!</i>
-What're you talking about?

00:04:03.678 --> 00:04:05.513 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Genzo] This will be
a piece of cake.

00:04:05.546 --> 00:04:07.515 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about it, guys.

00:04:07.548 --> 00:04:09.349 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sure thing, Captain.
We're just...

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:10.852 position:19% line:83% align:start
...wondering why you're
wasting time

00:04:10.885 --> 00:04:12.086 position:21% line:89% align:start
with that little kid.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.320 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:15.355 position:35% line:83% align:start
[player 1]
A challenge from Tsubasa?

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:16.924 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Genzo] He kicked that ball
into my yard

00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.458 position:21% line:83% align:start
from an unbelievable
distance.

00:04:18.492 --> 00:04:20.762 position:27% line:83% align:start
The power it had
was truly amazing.

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:26.333 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:28.102 position:35% line:83% align:start
So Captain,
are you saying

00:04:28.136 --> 00:04:29.537 position:16% line:83% align:start
you're gonna be accepting
his challenge?

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.140 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yes, that's exactly
what I'm saying.

00:04:32.173 --> 00:04:33.841 position:10% line:89% align:start
Wait just a second, Genzo...

00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:37.011 position:21% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa said he wants
to challenge just you!

00:04:37.044 --> 00:04:38.112 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's not fair for you

00:04:38.146 --> 00:04:40.114 position:16% line:83% align:start
to make him play against
the whole team!

00:04:40.148 --> 00:04:41.448 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, if he doesn't
want to do it,

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:43.483 position:30% line:83% align:start
then there will
be no challenge.

00:04:43.518 --> 00:04:45.253 position:44% line:83% align:start
[Ryo]
That's not right, Genzo!

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:46.721 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's all right, I'll do it.

00:04:46.754 --> 00:04:49.791 position:16% line:83% align:start
What? You're gonna do it?
Are you serious?

00:04:49.824 --> 00:04:51.993 position:16% line:83% align:start
If that's what it's gonna
take to challenge him, yes.

00:04:52.026 --> 00:04:53.261 position:27% line:89% align:start
But that's crazy.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.696 position:13% line:83% align:start
You can't play by yourself
against a whole team!

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.265 position:38% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.233 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't really get what
this whole thing's about,

00:04:59.267 --> 00:05:00.968 position:19% line:89% align:start
but it sounds like fun.

00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:03.470 position:10% line:83% align:start
This kid really think he can
challenge all of us?

00:05:03.504 --> 00:05:05.940 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think you could say
he's literally "lost it."

00:05:05.973 --> 00:05:06.941 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[player 3] [scoff]
-Uh...

00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:09.710 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't worry, Ryo...
I know I can do this.

00:05:09.744 --> 00:05:10.678 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:10.711 --> 00:05:13.548 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Ryo] Oh man,
I really hope you're right!

00:05:21.956 --> 00:05:25.693 position:35% line:89% align:start
[groaning]

00:05:25.726 --> 00:05:27.595 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[Ryo] Hey, Tsubasa...
-Hm?

00:05:27.628 --> 00:05:29.329 position:30% line:83% align:start
Please tell me
this is a joke...

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:32.733 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you really planning
to play with those shoes?

00:05:32.767 --> 00:05:33.768 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:34.802 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.338 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, yeah. These are
all I have right now...

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:40.875 position:24% line:83% align:start
What? But you need
soccer cleats!

00:05:40.908 --> 00:05:42.643 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckling]

00:05:42.677 --> 00:05:44.477 position:24% line:83% align:start
These guys might be
just the b-team,

00:05:44.512 --> 00:05:46.379 position:27% line:83% align:start
but they're still
really good players.

00:05:46.413 --> 00:05:48.348 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're going to be
facing them all alone.

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:49.917 position:19% line:83% align:start
And as difficult enough
as it is,

00:05:49.951 --> 00:05:52.920 position:10% line:83% align:start
without cleats, you won't be
able to get past any of them

00:05:52.954 --> 00:05:53.955 position:21% line:89% align:start
You really think so?

00:05:53.988 --> 00:05:56.489 position:19% line:83% align:start
If any of you guys has
a pair of extra cleats...

00:05:56.524 --> 00:05:58.192 position:21% line:89% align:start
let him borrow them.

00:05:58.226 --> 00:05:59.359 position:30% line:89% align:start
Okay, uh, sure.

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:01.195 position:27% line:83% align:start
Thank you, Genzo,
I appreciate it.

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:02.630 position:33% line:83% align:start
Please don't
misunderstand...

00:06:02.663 --> 00:06:04.298 position:21% line:83% align:start
I just don't want you
to be coming up with

00:06:04.332 --> 00:06:06.667 position:13% line:89% align:start
any excuses after you lose.

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:14.441 position:16% line:89% align:start
All right, let's do this!

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:22.650 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Mr. Mikami]
 <i>I still can't remember</i>

00:06:22.683 --> 00:06:24.986 position:27% line:83% align:start

 <i>that guy before...</i>

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:26.520 position:16% line:89% align:start
This is not looking good.

00:06:31.525 --> 00:06:33.327 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa]
You can see him, right?

00:06:33.361 --> 00:06:35.495 position:35% line:83% align:start
Listen up,
we have to thank him

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:37.164 position:19% line:89% align:start
for bringing you back.

00:06:37.198 --> 00:06:38.099 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa]
He's really good...

00:06:38.132 --> 00:06:38.933 position:24% line:89% align:start
His name is Genzo.

00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:42.536 position:19% line:83% align:start
[scoff] He's talking to
the ball again.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.772 position:24% line:83% align:start
He won last year's
national championship,

00:06:44.805 --> 00:06:46.974 position:19% line:83% align:start
and no one was able to
score a goal on him...

00:06:47.008 --> 00:06:50.344 position:33% line:83% align:start
He really is
an extraordinary goalkeeper.

00:06:50.378 --> 00:06:52.246 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa] But first,
we'll have to get past

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.514 position:21% line:89% align:start
all those players...

00:06:53.547 --> 00:06:56.150 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then we'll get our chance,
to show him what we got.

00:06:56.183 --> 00:06:58.352 position:27% line:83% align:start
What is this kid
babbling about?

00:06:58.386 --> 00:07:00.354 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think he's talking
to the ball. [chuckle]

00:07:00.388 --> 00:07:03.224 position:24% line:83% align:start
It looks to me like
he has a screw loose!

00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:04.392 position:24% line:89% align:start
All right, buddy...

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:07.261 position:27% line:83% align:start
You saved me when
I was just a little kid...

00:07:07.295 --> 00:07:09.530 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I'm gonna need
your help again.

00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:17.204 position:13% line:83% align:start
All right, we have to show
them our best right now.

00:07:17.238 --> 00:07:19.273 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Uh...
-Uh...

00:07:19.307 --> 00:07:21.242 position:27% line:83% align:start
What are you guys
waiting for?!

00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:22.944 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hurry up and take
the ball from him!

00:07:22.977 --> 00:07:24.477 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah!
-Yes, Captain!

00:07:24.512 --> 00:07:26.914 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Let's get him!
-Let's go!

00:07:28.683 --> 00:07:29.750 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ready?

new ways to mess with us.

00:13:48.028 --> 00:13:50.364 position:16% line:83% align:start
That fight we had earlier
over the field

00:13:50.397 --> 00:13:53.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
was just the latest stunt
they pulled.

00:13:53.334 --> 00:13:54.268 position:35% line:89% align:start
You said...

00:13:54.301 --> 00:13:56.738 position:27% line:83% align:start
we should all be
sharing the field.

00:13:56.771 --> 00:13:59.173 position:16% line:83% align:start
But nobody can get along
with those guys.

00:13:59.206 --> 00:14:00.207 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:02.811 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa]
That's not good at all.

00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:06.614 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah... That's why this
tournament is a big deal.

00:14:06.648 --> 00:14:09.216 position:21% line:83% align:start
Nankatsu and Shutetsu
always face off.

00:14:09.249 --> 00:14:12.821 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's a competition between
all the sports clubs.

00:14:12.853 --> 00:14:14.955 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's really a huge
event every year.

00:14:14.988 --> 00:14:16.658 position:24% line:89% align:start
Everyone loves it.

00:14:16.691 --> 00:14:17.826 position:21% line:83% align:start
People from all over
the city

00:14:17.858 --> 00:14:19.259 position:16% line:89% align:start
come to watch the games.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.962 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa]
That sounds amazing!

00:14:21.995 --> 00:14:23.163 position:44% line:83% align:start
[Ryo]
All of our clubs always

00:14:23.197 --> 00:14:25.600 position:13% line:89% align:start
give Shutetsu a good match

00:14:25.633 --> 00:14:27.201 position:13% line:89% align:start
except for our soccer team.

00:14:28.469 --> 00:14:32.106 position:10% line:83% align:start
We've never been able to win
a single match against them.

00:14:32.139 --> 00:14:35.275 position:24% line:83% align:start
So the whole school
thinks we're losers.

00:14:35.309 --> 00:14:37.144 position:38% line:83% align:start
But now,
with you on our team,

00:14:37.177 --> 00:14:39.313 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think we'll have
a really good chance.

00:14:39.346 --> 00:14:42.182 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm really excited
about this!

00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:43.317 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:44.351 position:38% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:14:47.856 --> 00:14:48.889 position:38% line:89% align:start
Let's go!

00:14:49.624 --> 00:14:51.392 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, I missed it!

00:14:52.794 --> 00:14:53.862 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Roberto]
Hey!

00:14:53.894 --> 00:14:54.995 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh?
Oh!

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.931 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa] Hey, mister...
Thanks so much for the pass!

00:14:57.965 --> 00:14:59.701 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're very welcome.

00:14:59.734 --> 00:15:00.568 position:30% line:89% align:start
You did great!

00:15:01.235 --> 00:15:02.302 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Roberto]
To be honest,

00:15:02.336 --> 00:15:04.539 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was truly impressed
by your moves.

00:15:04.572 --> 00:15:05.640 position:38% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.908 position:30% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa Ozora.

00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:11.613 position:16% line:83% align:start
[chuckle] Hi, my name is
Roberto Hongo.

00:15:11.646 --> 00:15:12.781 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's a pleasure.

00:15:12.814 --> 00:15:13.715 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:13.748 --> 00:15:15.617 position:30% line:89% align:start
Roberto Hongo.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.819 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hello. It's an honor
to meet you.

00:15:17.852 --> 00:15:20.588 position:16% line:83% align:start
-I'm your number one fan.
-Oh. [laugh]

00:15:20.622 --> 00:15:21.856 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, thank you!

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:23.023 position:19% line:89% align:start
I gotta say, I'm really

00:15:23.056 --> 00:15:24.158 position:19% line:83% align:start
-glad to meet you too.
-Oh man!

00:15:24.191 --> 00:15:25.593 position:19% line:89% align:start
This guy really stinks.

00:15:25.627 --> 00:15:26.861 position:38% line:83% align:start
He's just
a crazy drunk man!

00:15:26.895 --> 00:15:29.631 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, hello! Are you a friend
of Tsubasa here?

00:15:29.664 --> 00:15:30.732 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.
-Well,

00:15:30.765 --> 00:15:32.099 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm Roberto Hongo, buddy.

00:15:32.132 --> 00:15:34.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Nice to meet you!
-Nice to meet you.

00:15:34.101 --> 00:15:36.671 position:21% line:83% align:start
And tell me, are you
a soccer player as well?

00:15:36.704 --> 00:15:38.573 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I'm the captain.

00:15:38.606 --> 00:15:41.108 position:35% line:83% align:start
Excellent!
[laugh]

00:15:41.141 --> 00:15:44.011 position:21% line:83% align:start
This turned out to be
a great day! [laugh]

00:15:44.044 --> 00:15:45.946 position:27% line:83% align:start
I think this guy
is still drunk.

00:15:47.448 --> 00:15:48.949 position:24% line:89% align:start
So, how about this?

00:15:48.982 --> 00:15:50.284 position:27% line:83% align:start
Would you like me
to coach your team

00:15:50.317 --> 00:15:52.587 position:21% line:83% align:start
for this inter-school
tournament thing?

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.353 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:15:53.387 --> 00:15:54.388 position:27% line:89% align:start
Coach our team?!

00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:56.457 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why would we want
a drunk coach?

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:57.525 position:27% line:89% align:start
If you wanna win,

00:15:57.559 --> 00:15:59.661 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll teach you everything
you need to know.

00:15:59.694 --> 00:16:00.762 position:27% line:89% align:start
You'll teach us?

00:16:00.795 --> 00:16:02.262 position:33% line:83% align:start
Listen here.
We're desperate,

00:16:02.296 --> 00:16:04.431 position:16% line:83% align:start
but we don't need a drunk
to teach us anything!

00:16:04.465 --> 00:16:06.233 position:24% line:83% align:start
You can't expect to
become a coach

00:16:06.266 --> 00:16:07.769 position:33% line:83% align:start
just because
you have good luck.

00:16:07.802 --> 00:16:09.537 position:13% line:83% align:start
I have very high standards,
you know.

00:16:09.571 --> 00:16:11.739 position:16% line:83% align:start
[chuckle] I'm really glad
to hear that.

00:16:11.773 --> 00:16:13.775 position:27% line:83% align:start
I expect nothing
less of you.

00:16:13.808 --> 00:16:15.008 position:30% line:83% align:start
Then you better
take me seriously

00:16:15.042 --> 00:16:16.276 position:27% line:89% align:start
before I get mad!

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.680 position:16% line:83% align:start
And besides, I don't see
how a drunk like you

00:16:18.713 --> 00:16:20.247 position:24% line:83% align:start
could teach anybody
anything.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.349 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Fair enough.

00:16:22.382 --> 00:16:24.084 position:24% line:83% align:start
Maybe I can change
your mind.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.623 position:38% line:89% align:start

looking at?

00:17:03.892 --> 00:17:05.760 position:19% line:89% align:start

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:26.480 position:27% line:89% align:start
That was awesome!

00:17:26.514 --> 00:17:28.081 position:33% line:89% align:start
Huh! Amazing!

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:29.483 position:27% line:89% align:start
What do you say?

00:17:29.517 --> 00:17:31.418 position:27% line:83% align:start
You guys want me
to be your coach?

00:17:31.451 --> 00:17:33.621 position:35% line:83% align:start
I sure do!
That was really cool!

00:17:33.655 --> 00:17:34.656 position:44% line:83% align:start

-Oh?

Here's your hat.

What?
Where did he--?

00:17:40.895 --> 00:17:42.362 position:30% line:89% align:start

Hey, Tsubasa,
are you all right?

00:18:05.687 --> 00:18:08.856 position:16% line:83% align:start
[laugh] I guess that move
is harder than I thought.

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:10.024 position:21% line:89% align:start
Anyways, I gotta say

00:18:10.058 --> 00:18:11.759 position:27% line:83% align:start
that was a pretty
impressive first try.

00:18:11.793 --> 00:18:12.694 position:38% line:83% align:start

Yes, indeed!

00:18:12.727 --> 00:18:15.462 position:21% line:83% align:start

about this, Tsubasa!

00:18:15.495 --> 00:18:16.531 position:41% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:18:16.564 --> 00:18:17.565 position:38% line:89% align:start

You can't expect to learn
that trick so fast!

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.407 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'll try anyway.

00:18:27.441 --> 00:18:28.442 position:44% line:89% align:start

for you for a while.

00:19:24.231 --> 00:19:26.199 position:27% line:83% align:start
We're very close
to port now.

00:19:26.233 --> 00:19:29.671 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah. I'll finally be able
to go home for a while.

00:19:29.704 --> 00:19:32.874 position:13% line:83% align:start
By the way, tell me, how is
your son doing so far?

00:19:32.907 --> 00:19:34.374 position:16% line:89% align:start
He's growing up so fast.

00:19:34.408 --> 00:19:36.176 position:21% line:89% align:start
Time really flies by.

00:19:36.209 --> 00:19:38.345 position:21% line:83% align:start
I bet he'll be happy
to see you.

00:19:38.378 --> 00:19:39.881 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you gonna bring him
any gifts

00:19:39.914 --> 00:19:40.948 position:24% line:89% align:start
when you get back?

00:19:40.982 --> 00:19:43.051 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm sure he likes
video games.

00:19:43.084 --> 00:19:44.152 position:41% line:89% align:start
Well...

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:45.920 position:10% line:89% align:start
I already sent him a gift...

00:19:47.655 --> 00:19:50.758 position:19% line:83% align:start
and I'm sure he's gonna
really love it.

00:19:53.861 --> 00:20:07.975 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:20:08.009 --> 00:20:10.343 position:38% line:89% align:start
[panting]

00:20:10.978 --> 00:20:13.581 position:16% line:89% align:start
Man, this is really hard.

00:20:13.614 --> 00:20:16.818 position:13% line:83% align:start
I can't get the shot right
and I'm already dizzy.

00:20:16.851 --> 00:20:18.385 position:27% line:89% align:start
Come on, Tsubasa.

00:20:18.418 --> 00:20:20.387 position:27% line:83% align:start
Even someone with
all your skills

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.824 position:21% line:83% align:start
can't expect to learn
that trick so fast.

00:20:22.857 --> 00:20:23.791 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm not giving up!

00:20:28.495 --> 00:20:30.565 position:19% line:83% align:start
Come on. It's starting
to get dark already.

00:20:30.598 --> 00:20:33.134 position:16% line:83% align:start
I think it's time for us
to be getting home.

00:20:33.167 --> 00:20:34.902 position:27% line:83% align:start
Plus, I'm getting
really hungry.

00:20:34.936 --> 00:20:37.638 position:35% line:83% align:start
Come on...
One more try!

00:20:37.672 --> 00:20:38.673 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:43.544 --> 00:20:46.413 position:21% line:83% align:start
Roberto said he's got
a good feeling about this.

00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:51.619 position:33% line:83% align:start
I know we can
really do this.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.626 position:44% line:83% align:start
[Ryo]
 <i>It's amazing.</i>

00:20:58.659 --> 00:21:01.062 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>He's still not able to</i>
 <i>land the overhead kick.</i>

00:21:01.095 --> 00:21:02.329 position:33% line:89% align:start
 <i>But still...</i>

00:21:02.362 --> 00:21:04.699 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>he's hitting the crossbar</i>
 <i>in every try now.</i>

00:21:06.234 --> 00:21:08.002 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Ryo] <i>His control</i>
 <i>is unbelievable.</i>

00:21:16.144 --> 00:21:16.677 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:21:17.512 --> 00:21:20.347 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa]
Now, observe carefully.

00:21:22.016 --> 00:21:23.584 position:27% line:89% align:start
Look at the goal.

00:21:23.618 --> 00:21:24.619 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

00:21:26.254 --> 00:21:28.923 position:27% line:83% align:start
That right there
is our target.

00:21:30.091 --> 00:21:31.726 position:27% line:83% align:start
We're gonna score
this time!

00:21:33.393 --> 00:21:34.929 position:30% line:89% align:start
Let's do this!

00:21:36.964 --> 00:21:37.965 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:21:47.108 --> 00:21:48.308 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:52.580 position:41% line:89% align:start
Go in!

00:21:54.816 --> 00:21:55.917 position:30% line:89% align:start
There's no way!

00:21:56.684 --> 00:21:59.520 position:44% line:83% align:start
[Ryo]
Whoa, you really did it!

00:22:01.289 --> 00:22:02.489 position:38% line:89% align:start
I did it!

00:22:04.258 --> 00:22:06.761 position:41% line:83% align:start
[laugh]
I did it!

00:22:06.794 --> 00:22:09.462 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[laugh]
-That was amazing, Tsubasa.

00:22:09.496 --> 00:22:11.833 position:19% line:83% align:start
You got that technique
down perfectly.

00:22:11.866 --> 00:22:12.800 position:38% line:89% align:start
Awesome!

00:22:12.834 --> 00:22:14.401 position:24% line:89% align:start
Way to go, Tsubasa!

00:22:14.434 --> 00:22:17.939 position:41% line:83% align:start
[laugh]
Yeehaw!

00:22:17.972 --> 00:22:21.742 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:22:21.776 --> 00:22:23.945 position:35% line:83% align:start
You really
are amazing, Tsubasa!

00:22:23.978 --> 00:22:25.513 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:22:25.546 --> 00:22:28.716 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're a genius!
You're a wonder boy!

00:22:28.749 --> 00:22:30.651 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[laughing]
-[Ryo] Whoa! Wow!

00:22:30.685 --> 00:22:33.420 position:30% line:83% align:start
So this is how
Brazilians celebrate!
