-Doctor...

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.179 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm begging you.

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:53.180 position:19% line:89% align:start
If you don't help me,

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:54.616 position:24% line:83% align:start
we're going to lose
this match.

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.918 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, kid, you never listen,
do you?

00:01:56.951 --> 00:01:58.820 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't you get how serious
this is?

00:01:58.853 --> 00:02:00.187 position:16% line:89% align:start
You should be satisfied.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.356 position:21% line:83% align:start
You played more than
you ought to.

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:03.925 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you keep playing
imprudently,

00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.125 position:30% line:89% align:start
at that pace,

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:07.929 position:19% line:83% align:start
you'll put your future
soccer career at risk.

00:02:07.962 --> 00:02:09.097 position:24% line:89% align:start
Please, understand.

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.498 position:16% line:83% align:start
If your injuries worsen,
you won't be able...

00:02:11.532 --> 00:02:13.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
to be a professional player
anymore.

00:02:13.735 --> 00:02:15.168 position:19% line:89% align:start
Is that what you want?

00:02:16.738 --> 00:02:17.739 position:35% line:89% align:start
This is...

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:19.674 position:24% line:89% align:start
This is our dream.

00:02:19.707 --> 00:02:20.440 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:22.242 position:30% line:83% align:start
I understand
the consequences.

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:24.112 position:19% line:89% align:start
I understand, doctor.

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:25.613 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's our dream...

00:02:25.647 --> 00:02:27.214 position:24% line:83% align:start
my teammates and I
promised to win

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:28.583 position:16% line:89% align:start
our third championship.

00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:31.953 position:27% line:83% align:start
So I can't just
abandon them now.

00:02:31.986 --> 00:02:33.588 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uh... Tsubasa...

00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:36.658 position:33% line:83% align:start
If we lose,
I will stay in Japan,

00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:39.627 position:13% line:83% align:start
and all of my efforts will
have been in vain, doctor.

00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:42.229 position:19% line:83% align:start
I want to go to Brazil
with peace of mind.

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:44.999 position:24% line:83% align:start
Knowing that I left
my friends with a victory.

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:47.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's my parting gift
to them.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.737 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's why I can't
ever stop.

Now that Tsubasa's

00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:03.151 position:24% line:83% align:start
we have to defend
our goal, no matter what.

The Tiger Shot only goes

I'll block it with my body

his Tiger Shot on time.

[Tsubasa]
Yeah.

00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:54.962 position:13% line:89% align:start
I have some new bandages,

to the ground again,

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.242 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll take it upon myself

Of course I do.

00:12:03.857 --> 00:12:06.827 position:10% line:83% align:start
I know that I'm the scorer,
but I'm also...

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.929 position:13% line:89% align:start
a player for Toho Academy.

00:12:08.963 --> 00:12:11.700 position:13% line:83% align:start
And I can't leave anything
up to chance.

00:12:11.732 --> 00:12:13.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't forget that
Wakashimazu...

can't defend the goal
by himself.

00:12:16.237 --> 00:12:18.472 position:19% line:83% align:start
I will be helping you
defend our goal.

00:12:18.506 --> 00:12:23.143 position:19% line:83% align:start
