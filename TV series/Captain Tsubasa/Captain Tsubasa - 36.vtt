00:15:22.423 --> 00:15:23.357 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.125 position:24% line:83% align:start
Even though it was
a mild sprain,

00:15:25.159 --> 00:15:27.494 position:13% line:83% align:start
you have to take good care

it wasn't serious this time.

00:15:47.147 --> 00:15:48.783 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's just a mild sprain.

00:15:48.817 --> 00:15:49.751 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:15:49.784 --> 00:15:51.218 position:30% line:83% align:start
As the Nankatsu
team captain,

00:15:51.251 --> 00:15:53.788 position:16% line:83% align:start
it would be embarrassing
to have to sit out a game

00:15:53.822 --> 00:15:55.523 position:30% line:83% align:start
just because of
a leg injury.

You always work very hard
for the team, Tsubasa.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:59.727 position:33% line:89% align:start

00:15:59.761 --> 00:16:01.563 position:27% line:83% align:start
no more than you,

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.375 position:21% line:83% align:start

Now that I can't train,

00:16:37.998 --> 00:16:39.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
we should take advantage
of that

00:16:39.734 --> 00:16:40.768 position:13% line:89% align:start
and watch the soccer match

00:16:40.802 --> 00:16:42.971 position:19% line:83% align:start
between the Nishigaoka
and the Ozu-san.

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:45.038 position:24% line:83% align:start
Manabu is in one of
the stadiums.

00:16:45.072 --> 00:16:46.173 position:30% line:89% align:start
If we hurry up,

00:16:46.206 --> 00:16:48.776 position:24% line:83% align:start
maybe we can watch
the Furano match too.

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:49.544 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:16:49.577 --> 00:16:50.578 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:16:50.612 --> 00:16:51.679 position:38% line:83% align:start
Perfect.
Let's go!

00:16:51.713 --> 00:16:53.480 position:44% line:83% align:start
No...
Tsubasa, hold on.

00:16:53.515 --> 00:16:54.616 position:24% line:89% align:start
 <i>He doesn't change.</i>

00:16:54.649 --> 00:16:57.251 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>All of sudden, he stopped</i>
 <i>caring about his injury.</i>

00:17:03.323 --> 00:17:04.859 position:35% line:83% align:start
Hey, guys,
where's the captain?

00:17:04.893 --> 00:17:06.528 position:35% line:83% align:start
Don't know.
Maybe he's in the bathroom.

00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:09.831 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Coach...

00:17:09.864 --> 00:17:11.866 position:33% line:83% align:start
Captain Hyuga
hasn't arrived yet.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:12.934 position:27% line:89% align:start
He's not coming.

00:17:12.967 --> 00:17:13.635 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:17:14.468 --> 00:17:17.005 position:21% line:83% align:start
If Hyuga didn't come
to train...

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:18.940 position:33% line:83% align:start
it's because
we don't need him.

00:17:18.973 --> 00:17:20.274 position:35% line:83% align:start
As I said,
he won't be playing

00:17:20.307 --> 00:17:21.441 position:21% line:89% align:start
in this tournament...

00:17:21.475 --> 00:17:23.377 position:33% line:83% align:start
so I told him
to not show up.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:25.747 position:21% line:83% align:start
-What? That can't be.
-What? That can't be.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:29.383 position:10% line:83% align:start
But coach, we can't possibly
win without our captain.

00:17:29.416 --> 00:17:30.752 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Masaharu]
Yeah, he's right, sir.

00:17:30.785 --> 00:17:31.819 position:38% line:89% align:start
Silence!

00:17:31.853 --> 00:17:33.821 position:27% line:83% align:start

challenge me as well?

00:17:33.855 --> 00:17:35.088 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Uhh...
-Uhh...

00:17:35.122 --> 00:17:37.124 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you can't play
without a captain,

00:17:37.157 --> 00:17:38.492 position:24% line:89% align:start
I can remedy that.

you're the team's
new captain.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:43.363 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:17:43.397 --> 00:17:44.398 position:33% line:89% align:start

00:17:45.733 --> 00:17:47.635 position:35% line:83% align:start

00:19:57.999 --> 00:19:59.934 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, hey there, Tsubasa.

00:19:59.967 --> 00:20:01.169 position:19% line:89% align:start
How's your foot injury?

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:03.137 position:41% line:83% align:start
Well...
it's much better.

00:20:03.171 --> 00:20:04.806 position:13% line:89% align:start
It was only a minor sprain.

00:20:04.839 --> 00:20:05.940 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's great to hear.

00:20:05.973 --> 00:20:08.142 position:35% line:83% align:start
So, how was
the Furano match?

00:20:08.176 --> 00:20:10.645 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was pretty impressive,
you know.

00:20:10.678 --> 00:20:13.147 position:21% line:83% align:start
They're much stronger
than they were a year ago.

00:20:13.181 --> 00:20:14.949 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm sure they'll be
a tough rival to beat

00:20:14.982 --> 00:20:16.249 position:27% line:89% align:start
this time around.

00:20:16.283 --> 00:20:17.250 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa]
Seriously?

00:20:17.284 --> 00:20:18.653 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Manabu] Either way,
whoever wins

00:20:18.686 --> 00:20:20.988 position:27% line:83% align:start
the Nishiki-gaoka
and Ozu-san match

00:20:21.022 --> 00:20:22.690 position:24% line:83% align:start
will be a difficult
opponent to beat.

00:20:22.724 --> 00:20:24.592 position:13% line:83% align:start
So we can't be too careful
this time

00:20:24.625 --> 00:20:25.993 position:24% line:83% align:start
because they've all
greatly improved.

00:20:27.494 --> 00:20:29.664 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa] <i>It doesn't matter</i>
 <i>how tough they are...</i>

00:20:29.697 --> 00:20:31.866 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>I'll be the one to win</i>
 <i>this tournament...</i>

00:20:31.899 --> 00:20:33.000 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>and I will go to Brazil.</i>

00:20:34.068 --> 00:20:35.469 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Manabu]
Why are you here, Tsubasa?

00:20:35.503 --> 00:20:36.470 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:36.504 --> 00:20:38.271 position:24% line:83% align:start
You could've taken
advantage of your rest day

00:20:38.305 --> 00:20:40.608 position:24% line:83% align:start
to spend some time
with our manager.

00:20:40.641 --> 00:20:42.977 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't know,
go to the park or something?

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.011 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Uhh...
-Uhh...

00:20:44.045 --> 00:20:45.345 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[Kumi] Aha! You see?!
-[gasp]

00:20:45.378 --> 00:20:46.681 position:13% line:89% align:start
I knew they would be here.

00:20:47.582 --> 00:20:49.584 position:21% line:83% align:start
I just wanted to see
the Furano match.

00:20:49.617 --> 00:20:50.184 position:38% line:89% align:start
I get it.

00:20:50.218 --> 00:20:51.384 position:19% line:89% align:start
We finished practicing

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:54.021 position:16% line:83% align:start
and decided to come over
and see the match too.

00:20:54.055 --> 00:20:56.490 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, so how'd it go,
Tsubasa?

00:20:56.524 --> 00:20:59.193 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, the doctor said
it wasn't serious.

00:20:59.227 --> 00:21:01.294 position:19% line:83% align:start
He's not talking about
your foot, man.

00:21:01.328 --> 00:21:03.197 position:24% line:83% align:start
He's talking about
you and the manager.

00:21:03.231 --> 00:21:04.999 position:21% line:83% align:start
Did you hold her hand
or something?

00:21:05.032 --> 00:21:05.800 position:27% line:89% align:start
Come on, tell us.

00:21:05.833 --> 00:21:06.768 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-[Tsubasa] What?

00:21:06.801 --> 00:21:09.604 position:13% line:83% align:start
Tell us, how did everything
go with Tsubasa?

00:21:09.637 --> 00:21:10.838 position:27% line:89% align:start
Did he kiss you?

00:21:10.872 --> 00:21:12.240 position:44% line:83% align:start
Oh...
No, of course not.

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:13.340 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grwol]

00:21:13.373 --> 00:21:14.575 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Come on,
-How can you

00:21:14.609 --> 00:21:15.910 position:27% line:83% align:start
-spill the beans!
-ask something like that?

00:21:15.943 --> 00:21:16.511 position:35% line:83% align:start
-All right,
-Come on!

00:21:16.544 --> 00:21:17.477 position:38% line:83% align:start
-tell us,
-Tell us...

00:21:17.512 --> 00:21:18.246 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Romeo.
-Quit pretending.

00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:19.479 position:21% line:89% align:start
It just looks like..

00:21:19.514 --> 00:21:21.716 position:10% line:89% align:start
everyone is in a great mood.

00:21:25.787 --> 00:21:26.587 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Ms. Hyuga]
What?

00:21:26.621 --> 00:21:28.723 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're quitting
the Toho Academy?

00:21:28.756 --> 00:21:31.424 position:21% line:83% align:start
I had a disagreement
with the coach, so...

00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:32.994 position:24% line:83% align:start
he'll probably have
the school

00:21:33.027 --> 00:21:35.062 position:19% line:89% align:start
revoke my scholarship.

00:21:35.096 --> 00:21:38.099 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gulping]

00:21:38.132 --> 00:21:39.901 position:47% line:83% align:start
Ah!
And without that...

00:21:39.934 --> 00:21:41.669 position:13% line:89% align:start
I won't be able to keep...

00:21:41.702 --> 00:21:43.971 position:27% line:83% align:start
on studying there
because it's private.

00:21:44.005 --> 00:21:45.940 position:19% line:89% align:start
Honestly, I'm so sorry.

00:21:45.973 --> 00:21:46.541 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:21:46.574 --> 00:21:48.276 position:19% line:89% align:start
No, they can't do that.

00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:49.644 position:21% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about it.

00:21:49.677 --> 00:21:52.647 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't mind continuing
the year at a public school.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.749 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll look for a job
as soon as I graduate.

00:21:54.782 --> 00:21:55.783 position:35% line:89% align:start
But my son,

00:21:55.817 --> 00:21:58.953 position:16% line:83% align:start
what about your dream of
becoming a soccer player?

00:21:58.986 --> 00:22:00.688 position:21% line:89% align:start
I think that dream...

00:22:00.721 --> 00:22:04.225 position:24% line:83% align:start
will remain buried
for the rest of my life.

00:22:04.258 --> 00:22:05.458 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gulping]

00:22:05.893 --> 00:22:06.794 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:22:06.828 --> 00:22:07.628 position:35% line:89% align:start
Either way,

00:22:07.662 --> 00:22:09.831 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll keep playing
for my own fun.

00:22:09.864 --> 00:22:11.165 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm pretty sure that...

00:22:11.199 --> 00:22:13.935 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll be able to play
while I work.

00:22:13.968 --> 00:22:15.903 position:16% line:89% align:start
So don't worry about me.

00:22:15.937 --> 00:22:17.071 position:27% line:89% align:start
Kojiro, my son...

00:22:18.272 --> 00:22:21.709 position:33% line:83% align:start
 <i>I don't care</i>
 <i>if I have to quit soccer.</i>

00:22:21.742 --> 00:22:23.077 position:33% line:89% align:start
 <i>But first...</i>

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:24.111 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:22:27.048 --> 00:22:31.484 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Kojiro] <i>I wanna face</i>
 <i>Tsubasa for the last time...</i>

00:22:31.519 --> 00:22:35.022 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>and show him the true power</i>
 <i>of the tiger.</i>
