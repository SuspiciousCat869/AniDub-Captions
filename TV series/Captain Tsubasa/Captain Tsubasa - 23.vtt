And since it was counted
as Tsubasa's goal,

00:18:27.341 --> 00:18:30.310 position:27% line:83% align:start
that gives him 28
on the goal scorers table.

00:18:30.344 --> 00:18:33.047 position:27% line:83% align:start
So he's one goal
above Hyuga,

00:18:33.081 --> 00:18:34.882 position:30% line:83% align:start
which makes him
the top goal scorer

00:18:34.916 --> 00:18:36.483 position:19% line:83% align:start
of all the tournament,
right?

00:18:36.517 --> 00:18:38.653 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't let them get past you,
Tsubasa.

00:18:38.686 --> 00:18:39.754 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[laugh]
-The truth is,

00:18:39.787 --> 00:18:42.122 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm not interested in
being the top goal scorer.

00:18:42.155 --> 00:18:43.490 position:19% line:89% align:start
I want something else.

00:18:43.524 --> 00:18:44.257 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:45.059 --> 00:18:46.426 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa]
To win the tournament!

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.030 position:13% line:83% align:start
My dream is that we can fly
the flag together

00:18:49.063 --> 00:18:52.100 position:30% line:83% align:start
as champions of
the national tournament.

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:53.601 position:19% line:89% align:start
We worked really hard.

00:18:53.635 --> 00:18:56.571 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's why we have to
beat the Meiwa.

00:18:56.604 --> 00:18:58.472 position:41% line:89% align:start
[laugh]

00:18:58.506 --> 00:18:59.540 position:38% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa.

00:19:00.207 --> 00:19:01.909 position:44% line:83% align:start
Yeah!
Let's win!

00:19:01.943 --> 00:19:04.112 position:19% line:83% align:start
We have worked so hard
to get this far!

00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:07.115 position:21% line:83% align:start
We'll show Team Meiwa
who we are.

-Remember what was said.
-I thought that shot

00:19:18.092 --> 00:19:19.027 position:33% line:89% align:start
was going in.

Captain...

00:19:27.602 --> 00:19:28.870 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:29.704 --> 00:19:31.873 position:16% line:89% align:start
Kojiro, listen carefully.

00:19:31.906 --> 00:19:35.576 position:24% line:83% align:start
What you are doing
is not worth of Team Meiwa.

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:36.309 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:38.178 position:27% line:83% align:start
The Meiwa always
tries to score

00:19:38.211 --> 00:19:40.180 position:19% line:83% align:start
no matter how difficult
it is.

00:19:40.213 --> 00:19:41.281 position:30% line:89% align:start
But you, Hyuga,

00:19:41.314 --> 00:19:43.283 position:27% line:83% align:start
you are obsessed
to strike stupidly

00:19:43.316 --> 00:19:45.153 position:33% line:83% align:start
from outside
the penalty area!

00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:47.522 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's not how
Team Meiwa plays!

00:19:47.555 --> 00:19:48.488 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:19:48.523 --> 00:19:49.189 position:41% line:89% align:start

-Calm down, captain!

00:19:51.859 --> 00:19:52.860 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takeshi...

00:19:53.961 --> 00:19:55.262 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yes, captain?

00:19:57.431 --> 00:19:59.167 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Kojiro]
I want to apologize to you.

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:00.735 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:20:00.768 --> 00:20:01.869 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:20:01.903 --> 00:20:03.871 position:19% line:89% align:start
I apologize to you all.

00:20:03.905 --> 00:20:05.606 position:27% line:83% align:start
I think I'm just
a bit nervous.

00:20:06.741 --> 00:20:06.974 position:33% line:89% align:start
I must win...

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:11.079 position:19% line:83% align:start
in order to be accepted
at the Toho Academy.

00:20:11.112 --> 00:20:12.379 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?!
-Toho?!

00:20:12.412 --> 00:20:15.282 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't tell me you got
an invitation to join them.

00:20:15.315 --> 00:20:16.684 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:20:16.718 --> 00:20:20.088 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Kojiro] They approached me
after our first match.

00:20:20.121 --> 00:20:21.155 position:21% line:89% align:start
They told me they...

00:20:21.189 --> 00:20:22.255 position:16% line:89% align:start
were interested in me...

00:20:23.356 --> 00:20:26.393 position:13% line:83% align:start
and that I was a candidate
to join their school.

00:20:26.426 --> 00:20:29.296 position:27% line:83% align:start
And if I get in,
they would cover my tuition,

00:20:29.329 --> 00:20:31.431 position:19% line:83% align:start
from junior high school
to college.

00:20:32.667 --> 00:20:35.268 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's the reason why
I want to win.

00:20:36.137 --> 00:20:37.370 position:24% line:89% align:start
But Toho Academy...

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:40.074 position:24% line:83% align:start
is also interested
in Tsubasa.

00:20:40.108 --> 00:20:41.308 position:30% line:83% align:start
And that's why
I tried to score

00:20:41.341 --> 00:20:42.744 position:33% line:83% align:start
from outside
the penalty area.

00:20:43.945 --> 00:20:46.246 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Kojiro] I thought that if
I scored from that distance,

00:20:46.279 --> 00:20:47.949 position:13% line:83% align:start
I would be a better player
than him.

00:20:47.982 --> 00:20:50.484 position:21% line:83% align:start
But that attitude was
completely stupid from me.

00:20:51.652 --> 00:20:54.421 position:33% line:83% align:start
I understand
what I did was wrong.

00:20:54.454 --> 00:20:56.490 position:21% line:83% align:start
Please, I beg you for
your forgiveness.

00:20:56.524 --> 00:20:59.694 position:16% line:83% align:start
Takeshi is totally right.
I can't do that.

00:20:59.727 --> 00:21:00.962 position:27% line:89% align:start
Captain Hyuga...

00:21:00.995 --> 00:21:01.963 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:06.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll get one goal
from Genzo Wakabayashi

00:21:06.134 --> 00:21:06.768 position:30% line:89% align:start
no matter what!

00:21:07.769 --> 00:21:11.105 position:19% line:83% align:start
Because That's Meiwa's
real style of play!

00:21:11.139 --> 00:21:12.974 position:16% line:89% align:start
We'll win no matter what!

00:21:13.007 --> 00:21:14.441 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's the attitude!

00:21:14.474 --> 00:21:14.942 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mhm.

00:21:15.843 --> 00:21:17.377 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Yes, Captain!
-We'll do it for you!

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:18.378 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're going to play
for Toho, you'll see.

00:21:18.411 --> 00:21:19.547 position:33% line:83% align:start
Let's win for
the captain, guys!

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.948 position:27% line:83% align:start
The Meiwa will be
the champion of

00:21:20.982 --> 00:21:22.049 position:16% line:89% align:start
the national tournament!
