00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.651 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you really want to
keep this field.

00:08:37.685 --> 00:08:40.921 position:19% line:83% align:start
First, you gotta score
a goal on me!

00:08:40.955 --> 00:08:42.957 position:24% line:89% align:start

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.025 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh...

00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:46.761 position:27% line:83% align:start
If anyone scores
a single goal,

00:08:46.794 --> 00:08:48.262 position:35% line:83% align:start
we'll leave
the field immediately.

00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:52.266 position:30% line:89% align:start
How arrogant!

00:08:53.502 --> 00:08:55.469 position:27% line:83% align:start
Let's get this
over with then.

00:08:55.504 --> 00:08:56.771 position:35% line:89% align:start
You're on!

00:08:56.804 --> 00:08:58.672 position:16% line:83% align:start
Listen here. Even though
you obviously are

00:08:58.706 --> 00:09:00.741 position:10% line:89% align:start
a skilled goalkeeper, Genzo.

00:09:02.376 --> 00:09:03.611 position:24% line:89% align:start
There is no way...

00:09:03.644 --> 00:09:06.480 position:19% line:83% align:start
that you will be able
to defeat all of us.

00:09:06.515 --> 00:09:09.183 position:27% line:83% align:start
[chuckle] Well,
we are about to find out.

00:09:14.688 --> 00:09:16.424 position:38% line:83% align:start
I'll take
the first shot then.

00:09:16.457 --> 00:09:17.892 position:19% line:89% align:start
Watch and learn, Ryo.

00:09:17.925 --> 00:09:19.560 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll get this guy
outta here.

00:09:19.593 --> 00:09:20.895 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm counting on it!

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.302 position:30% line:89% align:start
Here it comes!

00:09:28.335 --> 00:09:29.303 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:09:30.938 --> 00:09:31.906 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:09:34.208 --> 00:09:35.009 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:09:35.042 --> 00:09:36.143 position:35% line:89% align:start
Surprise!

00:09:36.177 --> 00:09:37.111 position:19% line:89% align:start
Unlike a soccer ball,

00:09:37.144 --> 00:09:39.914 position:21% line:83% align:start
a rugby ball bounces
in random direction.

00:09:41.282 --> 00:09:42.316 position:38% line:89% align:start
[growl]

00:09:42.349 --> 00:09:43.451 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:09:43.484 --> 00:09:44.752 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:09:46.821 --> 00:09:50.925 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[cheering]
-Well done, Captain.

00:09:52.593 --> 00:09:53.928 position:19% line:89% align:start
All right, who's next?

00:09:55.029 --> 00:09:55.896 position:41% line:89% align:start
Whoa!

00:09:57.431 --> 00:10:00.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm next. Captain of
the handball team.

00:10:00.201 --> 00:10:01.570 position:5% line:83% align:start
A handball is
a lot smaller

00:10:01.602 --> 00:10:03.838 position:27% line:83% align:start
and faster than
a soccer ball.

00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:06.874 position:27% line:83% align:start
There is no way
you stop this.

00:10:06.907 --> 00:10:09.944 position:27% line:83% align:start
With this throw,
you are outta of here!

00:10:12.346 --> 00:10:13.681 position:38% line:83% align:start
-No way!
-Impossible.

00:10:13.714 --> 00:10:15.049 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Ryo]
What?

00:10:15.082 --> 00:10:16.585 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:10:16.617 --> 00:10:19.987 position:24% line:77% align:start
Oh man, he's really
a genius goalkeeper.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.989 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't let him see
you're intimidated.

00:10:22.022 --> 00:10:23.858 position:27% line:83% align:start
We can't let him
have this field...

00:10:23.891 --> 00:10:25.359 position:16% line:89% align:start
and humiliate all of us!

00:10:27.394 --> 00:10:29.330 position:21% line:89% align:start
I guess I'm up next.

00:10:29.363 --> 00:10:31.332 position:33% line:83% align:start
Come on now.
You can do this!

00:10:31.365 --> 00:10:32.733 position:35% line:89% align:start
[snicker]

00:10:32.766 --> 00:10:34.368 position:30% line:83% align:start
I don't care
how good you are.

00:10:34.401 --> 00:10:36.370 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's no way
you can stop this.

00:10:36.403 --> 00:10:38.139 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you really can
stop my fast ball,

00:10:38.172 --> 00:10:40.074 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm going to quit
baseball forever!

00:10:40.107 --> 00:10:41.208 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:10:41.242 --> 00:10:42.476 position:30% line:89% align:start
Come on then!

00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:45.446 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:10:45.479 --> 00:10:47.516 position:13% line:89% align:start
What exactly is so funny?

00:10:47.549 --> 00:10:48.849 position:35% line:89% align:start
Just go!

00:10:48.883 --> 00:10:50.151 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about him.

00:10:50.184 --> 00:10:53.187 position:30% line:83% align:start
Just give him
the fastest ball you got.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.155 position:27% line:89% align:start
All right then.

00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:56.757 position:16% line:89% align:start
Let's see how you do...

00:10:58.259 --> 00:10:59.293 position:35% line:89% align:start
with this!

00:11:00.394 --> 00:11:01.262 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:11:02.796 --> 00:11:04.365 position:27% line:89% align:start
There's no way.

00:11:04.398 --> 00:11:05.266 position:30% line:89% align:start
He caught it!

00:11:10.171 --> 00:11:13.407 position:27% line:83% align:start
[scared] I think
this guy's invincible.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.509 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:11:14.543 --> 00:11:16.243 position:24% line:89% align:start
So who's up next?

00:11:16.277 --> 00:11:17.311 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.314 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:11:28.289 --> 00:11:29.524 position:35% line:89% align:start
Amazing!

00:11:29.558 --> 00:11:31.526 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Uh...
-What's wrong, guys?

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.426 position:21% line:89% align:start
Ready to give it up?

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.195 position:38% line:89% align:start
[growl]

00:11:34.228 --> 00:11:36.397 position:24% line:83% align:start
I guess no one else
will step up...

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.265 position:24% line:89% align:start
Not so fast, Genzo!

00:11:41.335 --> 00:11:43.237 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay. And tell me

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:45.674 position:27% line:83% align:start
what sport is it
that you represent then?

00:11:45.706 --> 00:11:48.842 position:41% line:83% align:start
Well...
The javelin throw.

00:11:48.876 --> 00:11:51.812 position:33% line:83% align:start
A javelin?
That's way too dangerous!

00:11:51.845 --> 00:11:52.980 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about it.

00:11:53.013 --> 00:11:56.383 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've already covered
the business end of it.

00:11:56.417 --> 00:11:57.284 position:35% line:89% align:start
Whatever.

00:11:57.318 --> 00:11:58.319 position:13% line:89% align:start
Take your best shot then!

00:11:58.352 --> 00:12:00.454 position:10% line:89% align:start
This guy is really arrogant.

00:12:03.824 --> 00:12:06.160 position:24% line:83% align:start
There is no chance
you can stop this!

00:12:06.193 --> 00:12:07.328 position:27% line:89% align:start
Let's find out!

00:12:14.368 --> 00:12:17.104 position:35% line:89% align:start
[yelling]

00:12:19.507 --> 00:12:21.475 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:12:23.377 --> 00:12:25.045 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[gasp]
-He jumped!

00:12:25.079 --> 00:12:27.314 position:35% line:89% align:start
[yelling]

00:12:27.348 --> 00:12:29.116 position:10% line:89% align:start
He deflected it with a kick!

00:12:34.755 --> 00:12:36.223 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's impossible.

00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:39.493 position:16% line:89% align:start
So this is settled now.

00:12:41.529 --> 00:12:43.163 position:35% line:83% align:start
Make sure
you train hard, guys.

00:12:43.197 --> 00:12:44.498 position:21% line:83% align:start
-All right, Captain!
-All right, Captain!

00:12:47.502 --> 00:12:48.836 position:41% line:89% align:start
Wow...

00:12:51.472 --> 00:12:53.140 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is awesome.

00:12:53.173 --> 00:12:55.242 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've never seen such
a great goalkeeper.

00:12:57.778 --> 00:13:00.347 position:35% line:89% align:start
[growling]

00:13:00.381 --> 00:13:01.148 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:02.049 --> 00:13:03.484 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Ryo]
You're leaving?

00:13:03.518 --> 00:13:05.219 position:13% line:89% align:start
Listen, I'm really sorry.

00:13:05.252 --> 00:13:06.020 position:5% line:89% align:start
-Huh?

00:13:06.053 --> 00:13:08.155 position:10% line:89% align:start
-We all got to go train too.

00:13:08.188 --> 00:13:09.456 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-You're gonna have to

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:10.858 position:16% line:89% align:start
give up the field, Ryo.

00:13:10.891 --> 00:13:12.793 position:30% line:89% align:start
What?! No way!

00:13:12.826 --> 00:13:16.363 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought you guys were
going to help me fix this.

00:13:16.397 --> 00:13:17.064 position:44% line:89% align:start
Man!

00:13:17.097 --> 00:13:19.500 position:5% line:89% align:start
These guys are a disgrace!

00:13:19.534 --> 00:13:20.367 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, Ryo.

00:13:21.802 --> 00:13:23.170 position:24% line:83% align:start
What are you still
doing here, bud?

00:13:23.203 --> 00:13:24.338 position:30% line:83% align:start
Why don't you
get off the field

00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:25.774 position:16% line:89% align:start
so we can train already.

00:13:25.806 --> 00:13:27.341 position:35% line:89% align:start
[growling]

00:13:27.374 --> 00:13:28.142 position:41% line:89% align:start
Fine!

00:13:29.243 --> 00:13:31.513 position:19% line:83% align:start
You guys may have won
this battle,

00:13:31.546 --> 00:13:34.248 position:27% line:83% align:start
but you will not
win this war!

00:13:34.281 --> 00:13:35.249 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:36.551 --> 00:13:37.384 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hi there.

00:13:39.219 --> 00:13:42.289 position:10% line:83% align:start
Say, could you tell me where
that goalkeeper went?

00:13:42.323 --> 00:13:43.525 position:19% line:89% align:start
How would I know that?

00:13:43.558 --> 00:13:45.225 position:35% line:83% align:start
He probably
went home already.

00:13:45.259 --> 00:13:47.328 position:16% line:83% align:start
Do you think you could
show me where he lives?

00:13:47.361 --> 00:13:48.829 position:30% line:83% align:start
And why is it
that you want to know

00:13:48.862 --> 00:13:50.297 position:27% line:89% align:start
where he lives?

00:13:50.331 --> 00:13:51.666 position:19% line:89% align:start
I wanna challenge him.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.067 position:27% line:89% align:start
Challenge him?!

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.636 position:10% line:89% align:start
You must be outta your mind!

00:13:54.669 --> 00:13:55.804 position:19% line:89% align:start
I guess you didn't see

00:13:55.836 --> 00:13:57.505 position:27% line:83% align:start
what he just did
to those guys.

00:13:57.539 --> 00:13:59.173 position:30% line:83% align:start
He even caught
a baseball!

00:13:59.206 --> 00:14:00.307 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'll defeat him!

00:14:00.341 --> 00:14:01.408 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:14:01.442 --> 00:14:02.711 position:38% line:89% align:start
Well...

00:14:02.744 --> 00:14:05.379 position:19% line:83% align:start
I guess I could show
you where his house is.

00:14:05.412 --> 00:14:06.648 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's great!

00:14:06.681 --> 00:14:08.382 position:35% line:83% align:start
[chuckle]
By the way...

00:14:08.415 --> 00:14:09.950 position:19% line:89% align:start
What's your name, kid?

00:14:09.983 --> 00:14:12.687 position:24% line:83% align:start
Listen, my name is
Ryo Ishizaki.

00:14:12.721 --> 00:14:13.788 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, Ryo.

00:14:13.822 --> 00:14:15.322 position:24% line:89% align:start
My name is Tsubasa.

00:14:34.441 --> 00:14:35.677 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, Tsubasa.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:36.811 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:14:36.845 --> 00:14:38.580 position:33% line:83% align:start
You dribble
that ball everywhere.

00:14:38.613 --> 00:14:40.648 position:35% line:83% align:start
-How come?
-It's my friend.

00:14:40.682 --> 00:14:41.482 position:24% line:89% align:start
What do you mean?

00:14:42.883 --> 00:14:44.051 position:30% line:89% align:start
I love soccer.

00:14:44.084 --> 00:14:45.687 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't you like
to play too?

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.422 position:35% line:83% align:start
Sure I do.
I guess I like it.

00:14:48.455 --> 00:14:49.289 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:14:50.692 --> 00:14:51.793 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Ryo]
 <i>This kid is weird.</i>

 <i>But he's pretty good.</i>

00:14:55.429 --> 00:14:56.430 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laugh]

00:15:00.467 --> 00:15:01.435 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:04.405 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, Tsubasa.

00:15:04.438 --> 00:15:06.273 position:24% line:83% align:start
So I'm guessing you
just moved here.

00:15:06.306 --> 00:15:07.408 position:5% line:89% align:start
Isn't that right?

00:15:07.441 --> 00:15:10.277 position:10% line:83% align:start
From up here, we have a nice
view of the whole city.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.413 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Looks nice, right?
-Yeah!

00:15:12.446 --> 00:15:14.081 position:24% line:89% align:start
Look, over there!

00:15:14.114 --> 00:15:16.450 position:24% line:83% align:start
That right there
is Genzo's house.

00:15:17.585 --> 00:15:18.853 position:21% line:89% align:start
[chuckle] All right.

00:15:18.887 --> 00:15:19.987 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you!

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.255 position:19% line:89% align:start
I think Genzo's family

00:15:21.288 --> 00:15:24.759 position:19% line:83% align:start
is one of the richest
in the entire city.

00:15:24.793 --> 00:15:25.959 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:25.993 --> 00:15:27.461 position:41% line:83% align:start
Hey...
What are you doing?

00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:30.598 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:15:34.769 --> 00:15:35.837 position:41% line:89% align:start
Man...

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.104 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's up there.

00:15:39.473 --> 00:15:40.642 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Did you see it?
-Huh?

00:15:41.743 --> 00:15:43.310 position:19% line:89% align:start
Did you see his house?

00:15:43.343 --> 00:15:44.846 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's where
the goalkeeper lives.

00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:46.046 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:48.482 position:21% line:83% align:start
I bet you can't wait
to challenge him, right?

00:15:48.516 --> 00:15:49.584 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huh? Wait.

00:15:49.617 --> 00:15:50.752 position:35% line:89% align:start
Are you...

00:15:50.785 --> 00:15:52.720 position:24% line:83% align:start
talking to the ball
right now?

00:15:52.754 --> 00:15:55.022 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now I'm really glad
we moved here.

00:15:55.055 --> 00:15:57.357 position:10% line:83% align:start
I think in this city we're
going to have a great time.

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:00.394 position:38% line:83% align:start
Finally,
we found a place

00:16:00.427 --> 00:16:02.630 position:24% line:83% align:start
where we can play
real soccer.

00:16:02.664 --> 00:16:04.164 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hey...
Hey, Tsubasa.

00:16:04.198 --> 00:16:05.767 position:24% line:89% align:start
So what's the plan?

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.034 position:27% line:89% align:start
I have an idea.

00:16:07.067 --> 00:16:08.168 position:27% line:89% align:start
I can see that.

00:16:08.202 --> 00:16:10.037 position:21% line:89% align:start
But listen, Tsubasa.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.940 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm not really sure
what your plan is.

00:16:11.972 --> 00:16:13.407 position:16% line:89% align:start
But an amateur like you

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.143 position:19% line:83% align:start
can't expect to defeat
a player like Genzo.

00:16:16.176 --> 00:16:17.411 position:27% line:83% align:start
Him and his team
won the last

00:16:17.444 --> 00:16:18.913 position:21% line:89% align:start
national tournament.

00:16:18.947 --> 00:16:22.015 position:5% line:83% align:start
And no one was able to
score a single goal on him.

00:16:22.049 --> 00:16:23.618 position:24% line:89% align:start
You don't stand a--

00:16:23.651 --> 00:16:24.451 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:25.118 --> 00:16:26.521 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, Tsubasa!

00:16:26.554 --> 00:16:29.423 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you even listening
to what I'm saying?

00:16:29.456 --> 00:16:31.626 position:24% line:83% align:start
What in the world
are you doing?

00:16:31.659 --> 00:16:32.426 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:33.695 --> 00:16:35.563 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I think you're ready.
-Huh?

00:16:35.597 --> 00:16:36.531 position:19% line:89% align:start
You gotta be kidding!

00:16:38.398 --> 00:16:40.902 position:35% line:89% align:start

00:16:40.935 --> 00:16:44.706 position:35% line:89% align:start

00:16:44.739 --> 00:16:46.273 position:41% line:89% align:start
Whoa!

00:16:47.876 --> 00:16:48.743 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:16:51.445 --> 00:16:52.647 position:33% line:89% align:start
Wait. Wait.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.982 position:38% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:55.249 position:27% line:83% align:start
You think you can
get the ball

00:16:55.282 --> 00:16:57.317 position:27% line:83% align:start
to Genzo's house
with one kick?

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.221 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa]
Here we go!

00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:07.094 position:35% line:89% align:start
[groaning]

00:17:10.163 --> 00:17:12.065 position:33% line:83% align:start
-All right.
-[hawk screech]

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:13.801 position:35% line:89% align:start
Let's go!

00:17:13.835 --> 00:17:15.302 position:19% line:89% align:start
You gotta be kidding!

00:17:20.307 --> 00:17:21.174 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:24.378 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Amazing!
-That's crazy!

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:27.481 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:17:30.552 --> 00:17:32.219 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Mr. Mikami]
What's going on, Genzo?

00:17:35.122 --> 00:17:36.223 position:35% line:83% align:start
Where did
that come from?

00:17:36.256 --> 00:17:37.825 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm not really sure.

00:17:37.859 --> 00:17:40.127 position:21% line:83% align:start
I just saw it coming
towards me.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.495 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I think it came
from up there.

00:17:41.529 --> 00:17:42.396 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

00:17:42.997 --> 00:17:44.498 position:27% line:89% align:start
From that hill?

00:17:44.532 --> 00:17:47.301 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't be ridiculous, Genzo.
That's impossible.

00:17:47.334 --> 00:17:48.503 position:38% line:89% align:start
I know.

00:17:48.536 --> 00:17:50.137 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:51.438 --> 00:17:54.374 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is a challenge
from Tsubasa.

00:17:54.408 --> 00:17:57.110 position:38% line:83% align:start
What?!
That's really incredible.

00:17:57.144 --> 00:17:58.846 position:16% line:89% align:start
Right on his back yard.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.748 position:33% line:83% align:start
Do you think
he got my message?

00:18:00.782 --> 00:18:03.116 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Come on, stop playing!
-Ow!

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.986 position:24% line:83% align:start
How did you kick it
that far?

00:18:05.019 --> 00:18:06.054 position:33% line:89% align:start
Let me see.

00:18:07.187 --> 00:18:08.656 position:41% line:83% align:start
-[gasp]
-You have some kind of

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:10.123 position:13% line:89% align:start
bionic foot or something?

00:18:10.157 --> 00:18:11.926 position:27% line:83% align:start
No, what are you
talking about?

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.327 position:27% line:89% align:start
All right then.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.997 position:24% line:83% align:start
This means you have
a real chance to beat Genzo!

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.431 position:24% line:89% align:start
I can't believe it.

00:18:17.464 --> 00:18:19.499 position:24% line:83% align:start
We have a chance to
get our field back!

00:18:21.536 --> 00:18:22.737 position:33% line:89% align:start
A challenge.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:25.640 position:24% line:83% align:start
Genzo, your mind is
playing tricks on you.

00:18:25.673 --> 00:18:27.240 position:13% line:89% align:start
Nobody can kick that far.

00:18:29.677 --> 00:18:30.612 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:30.645 --> 00:18:33.180 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh! Hey, good boy!

00:18:33.213 --> 00:18:35.382 position:19% line:83% align:start
Can someone get a hold
of that dog, please?!

00:18:35.415 --> 00:18:36.283 position:35% line:89% align:start
John! Sit!

[laughs]

00:18:43.658 --> 00:18:44.759 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh man!

00:18:44.792 --> 00:18:46.027 position:13% line:89% align:start
Who in the world are you?

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.294 position:19% line:83% align:start
He's a stalker, Genzo.
I'm calling the cops!

00:18:47.327 --> 00:18:49.063 position:19% line:89% align:start
No, no, wait a second.

00:18:49.097 --> 00:18:50.598 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm not a stalker, friend.

00:18:51.231 --> 00:18:52.466 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Roberto]
I was...

00:18:52.499 --> 00:18:54.836 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was just following
a soccer ball I saw

00:18:54.869 --> 00:18:56.203 position:24% line:83% align:start
come from the top
of the hill...

00:18:56.236 --> 00:18:58.606 position:27% line:83% align:start
And end up here.
[laughs]

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.308 position:16% line:83% align:start
What?! So it really came
from up there?

00:19:01.341 --> 00:19:02.644 position:21% line:89% align:start
What's weird is that

00:19:02.677 --> 00:19:05.178 position:19% line:83% align:start
I think it was kicked
over here by a kid.

00:19:05.212 --> 00:19:06.648 position:24% line:89% align:start
By a kid, you say?

00:19:06.681 --> 00:19:07.915 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Genzo]
Well...

00:19:07.949 --> 00:19:09.483 position:35% line:83% align:start
Judging by
the handwriting...

00:19:14.254 --> 00:19:16.524 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Here.
-Oh, thank you.

00:19:16.557 --> 00:19:19.459 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm really, really hoping
that you can beat Genzo.

00:19:19.493 --> 00:19:21.461 position:19% line:83% align:start
But first, let's have
some ice cream.

00:19:26.366 --> 00:19:28.603 position:21% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa, I need you
to do something for me.

00:19:28.636 --> 00:19:29.369 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:19:29.403 --> 00:19:31.506 position:27% line:83% align:start
If Genzo accepts
your challenge,

00:19:31.539 --> 00:19:33.941 position:21% line:83% align:start
you have to tell him
that if you win,

00:19:33.975 --> 00:19:35.242 position:19% line:89% align:start
we get the field back.

00:19:35.275 --> 00:19:36.476 position:27% line:89% align:start
So we can train.

00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:37.812 position:35% line:89% align:start
But why?

00:19:37.845 --> 00:19:39.479 position:19% line:89% align:start
What do you mean why?

00:19:39.514 --> 00:19:41.481 position:30% line:83% align:start
Didn't you see
what happened earlier?

00:19:41.516 --> 00:19:44.085 position:27% line:83% align:start
He basically just
took over our field.

00:19:44.118 --> 00:19:45.352 position:19% line:89% align:start
So what's the problem?

00:19:45.385 --> 00:19:46.988 position:5% line:89% align:start
Every field has two goals.

00:19:47.021 --> 00:19:48.623 position:5% line:83% align:start
You could all
play together

00:19:48.656 --> 00:19:51.592 position:13% line:83% align:start
instead of fighting over
who gets to keep the field.

00:19:51.626 --> 00:19:52.492 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

Hey, what's wrong,
Mr. Mikami?

00:20:29.296 --> 00:20:30.363 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Mr. Mikami] Well...

00:20:31.465 --> 00:20:32.533 position:19% line:83% align:start
That bum from earlier

00:20:32.567 --> 00:20:34.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
has been following us
this whole time.

00:20:34.367 --> 00:20:36.204 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Genzo]
He's obviously just a drunk.

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:37.370 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groan]

00:20:39.207 --> 00:20:40.340 position:33% line:89% align:start
Look there!

00:20:40.373 --> 00:20:41.509 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's our field.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.310 position:35% line:89% align:start
Come on.

00:20:44.579 --> 00:20:45.847 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Mr. Mikami]
Listen to me.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:49.217 position:13% line:83% align:start
There has to be a logical
explanation for this.

00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:50.885 position:19% line:89% align:start
Genzo, there is no way

00:20:50.918 --> 00:20:52.620 position:30% line:83% align:start
someone could
make that shot.

00:20:52.653 --> 00:20:53.821 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're right.

00:20:53.855 --> 00:20:55.388 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[Ryo] No way!
-Huh?

00:20:56.456 --> 00:20:57.625 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Look, it's Genzo!

00:20:57.658 --> 00:20:59.694 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa] And look!
He's got my ball.

00:20:59.727 --> 00:21:02.630 position:13% line:83% align:start
He received my challenge,
after all.

00:21:02.663 --> 00:21:03.531 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh...

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.736 position:16% line:83% align:start
So Genzo... What do you
have to say now?

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:12.240 position:13% line:83% align:start
This right here is the kid
that challenged you earlier.

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:13.440 position:27% line:89% align:start
There is no way.

00:21:13.473 --> 00:21:16.077 position:10% line:89% align:start
But he is just a little kid.

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:16.978 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh...

00:21:20.081 --> 00:21:21.481 position:24% line:83% align:start
What are you trying
to pull, huh?

00:21:21.516 --> 00:21:22.750 position:21% line:83% align:start
You really expect me
to believe

00:21:22.784 --> 00:21:25.318 position:21% line:83% align:start
that a kid like that
has such a power kick?

00:21:25.352 --> 00:21:27.387 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Ryo] You believe
whatever you want.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.791 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're probably just
scared he'll beat you!

00:21:29.824 --> 00:21:30.725 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Genzo] How dare you!

00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:34.762 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Genzo] Let's settle this right

00:21:34.796 --> 00:21:37.665 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you really want
to challenge me...

00:21:37.698 --> 00:21:39.700 position:30% line:89% align:start
then let's go!

00:21:40.701 --> 00:21:42.570 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Ryo] Watch out!
Get out of the way!

00:21:47.642 --> 00:21:50.011 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Genzo thinking] How did he</i>
 <i>deflect that shot?</i>

00:21:50.044 --> 00:21:50.978 position:13% line:89% align:start
 <i>Perfectly upwards.</i>

00:21:53.648 --> 00:21:54.515 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:21:55.283 --> 00:21:56.316 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Ryo]
Wait.

00:21:58.385 --> 00:22:00.387 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Ryo] Don't shoot.
There is a bus coming!

00:22:03.591 --> 00:22:04.525 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:22:08.296 --> 00:22:09.664 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:22:13.201 --> 00:22:14.467 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Genzo] Whoa...

00:22:15.269 --> 00:22:16.369 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Tsubasa] Nice catch, Genzo.

00:22:16.403 --> 00:22:17.437 position:24% line:89% align:start
So what do you say?

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:18.739 position:27% line:83% align:start
Will you accept
my challenge?

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:23.511 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Genzo]
This is crazy.

00:22:23.544 --> 00:22:25.880 position:30% line:83% align:start
This kid's got
some power!

00:22:25.913 --> 00:22:27.048 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah.

00:22:27.081 --> 00:22:28.049 position:30% line:89% align:start
By the way...

00:22:28.082 --> 00:22:29.650 position:21% line:89% align:start
my name is Tsubasa.
