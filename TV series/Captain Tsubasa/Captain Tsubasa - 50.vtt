I'm sorry,

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.232 position:13% line:83% align:start

young man.

-Huh?
-Huh?

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.402 position:13% line:89% align:start
You guys heard the doctor.

00:20:35.435 --> 00:20:37.972 position:13% line:83% align:start
You played incredibly well,
Tsubasa,

00:20:38.005 --> 00:20:39.640 position:13% line:89% align:start
but now, you have to rest.

00:20:39.674 --> 00:20:42.409 position:21% line:83% align:start
What's important now
is your body's health.

00:20:42.442 --> 00:20:43.678 position:24% line:89% align:start
But please, coach.

00:20:43.711 --> 00:20:46.881 position:21% line:83% align:start
I promise you my body
is doing just fine.

00:20:46.914 --> 00:20:47.915 position:24% line:89% align:start
I was depressed...

00:20:48.716 --> 00:20:51.384 position:27% line:83% align:start
but Hyuga made me
open my eyes.

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:54.756 position:21% line:83% align:start
He knew that my body
hadn't reached its limit.

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:59.026 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have a responsibility
to him as well.

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.662 position:16% line:83% align:start
Not just to my teammates,
Coach.

00:21:01.696 --> 00:21:02.764 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right!

00:21:02.797 --> 00:21:03.831 position:19% line:89% align:start
If Tsubasa wasn't okay,

00:21:03.865 --> 00:21:06.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
he couldn't have possibly
made those shots, doctor.

00:21:07.001 --> 00:21:08.569 position:33% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa will
get out of the pitch

00:21:08.603 --> 00:21:10.972 position:16% line:83% align:start
when he really can't move
anymore, doctor.

00:21:11.005 --> 00:21:12.305 position:24% line:89% align:start
But you kids have--

00:21:12.339 --> 00:21:13.674 position:13% line:89% align:start
The thing is, our dream...

00:21:13.708 --> 00:21:15.342 position:38% line:83% align:start
is to win
our third championship.

00:21:15.375 --> 00:21:16.911 position:13% line:89% align:start
Isn't that right, Captain?

00:21:16.944 --> 00:21:17.945 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:21:22.884 --> 00:21:23.885 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:26.254 --> 00:21:27.955 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa] Hello,
what're you doing here?

00:21:27.989 --> 00:21:29.023 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hello, Tsubasa.

00:21:31.993 --> 00:21:33.127 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm begging you...

00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:34.461 position:30% line:89% align:start
don't give up.

00:21:34.494 --> 00:21:37.064 position:27% line:83% align:start
You have to play
until the end.

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.307 position:44% line:89% align:start

00:21:55.049 --> 00:21:56.150 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:21:57.985 --> 00:21:59.821 position:16% line:89% align:start

00:21:59.854 --> 00:22:02.290 position:16% line:83% align:start
I think something must've
gotten in my eye.

00:22:02.322 --> 00:22:03.524 position:33% line:89% align:start
But I'm fine.

00:22:03.558 --> 00:22:06.294 position:13% line:83% align:start
Although you didn't get to
score in this half,

00:22:06.326 --> 00:22:08.428 position:13% line:89% align:start
you played amazingly well.

00:22:08.461 --> 00:22:11.232 position:13% line:83% align:start

I'm proud of you.

00:22:11.265 --> 00:22:12.432 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Wakashimazu...
-Huh?

00:22:12.465 --> 00:22:14.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
Will you be able to play
during the extra time?

00:22:14.467 --> 00:22:16.137 position:10% line:89% align:start
Of course I can, Head Coach.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.139 position:10% line:89% align:start
We have 20 minutes to score.

00:22:18.172 --> 00:22:19.040 position:33% line:89% align:start

00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:20.208 position:41% line:83% align:start
