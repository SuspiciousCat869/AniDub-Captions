[Ryo]
They're white and blue!

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.881 position:13% line:83% align:start
That means we'll be playing
in the finals

00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:55.449 position:13% line:89% align:start
with our home team colors.

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:56.017 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.985 position:24% line:89% align:start
And you better win.

00:01:57.018 --> 00:01:58.318 position:24% line:83% align:start
Because it took us
a long time

00:01:58.352 --> 00:01:59.621 position:27% line:83% align:start
to wash and iron
all of them.

00:01:59.654 --> 00:02:01.789 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't worry. We'll show them
a thing or two.

00:02:01.823 --> 00:02:04.659 position:10% line:83% align:start
We're going to win our third
championship, Nankatsu.

00:02:04.692 --> 00:02:05.392 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:06.861 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is getting me
pumped up,

00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:09.831 position:13% line:83% align:start
but I can't help but think
of Tsubasa's injury. I wish

00:02:09.864 --> 00:02:11.065 position:19% line:83% align:start
-he could play with us.

Tsubasa will have to spend
the night at the hospital

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:15.637 position:24% line:89% align:start
at least for today.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.706 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sanae, could you go over
and give him his jersey?

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.874 position:35% line:83% align:start
Yeah, sure.
No problem.

The following

This is an ultimatum.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.128 position:27% line:83% align:start
You have to allow

Huh?

00:05:05.706 --> 00:05:08.910 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've always considered
myself a consistent man.

00:05:08.943 --> 00:05:10.878 position:13% line:89% align:start
My rules and punishments...

00:05:10.912 --> 00:05:12.479 position:27% line:89% align:start
are irrefutable.

00:05:12.513 --> 00:05:15.149 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's what makes me
a good coach.

00:05:15.183 --> 00:05:16.684 position:16% line:89% align:start

left without
your permission, sir.

00:06:17.578 --> 00:06:19.347 position:24% line:83% align:start
But you should know
he only did it

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.182 position:10% line:89% align:start
so he could defeat Nankatsu.

00:06:21.215 --> 00:06:22.884 position:27% line:83% align:start
He went to train
in Okinawa...

00:06:22.917 --> 00:06:25.253 position:21% line:83% align:start
just so he could grow
as a player.

that I'm not the team's
only representative.

But I am the head coach
and I have a responsibility.

00:06:55.616 --> 00:06:58.619 position:13% line:83% align:start

Toho is an elite team

that doesn't solely
rely on his captain.

00:09:41.348 --> 00:09:42.783 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Kitazume]
It's simple.

00:09:42.817 --> 00:09:45.586 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's because I've decided
to let Hyuga play

00:09:45.619 --> 00:09:47.221 position:13% line:89% align:start
in the tournament's final.

Hmm...

00:09:48.289 --> 00:09:49.524 position:33% line:89% align:start
By doing so,

00:09:49.558 --> 00:09:51.125 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm contradicting
my principles

00:09:51.158 --> 00:09:51.926 position:27% line:89% align:start
as a head coach.

00:09:52.693 --> 00:09:54.595 position:16% line:83% align:start
I violated the standards
I set,

00:09:54.628 --> 00:09:56.497 position:16% line:83% align:start
and that disqualifies me
as the head coach

00:09:56.531 --> 00:09:57.865 position:27% line:89% align:start
for Toho Academy.

00:09:57.898 --> 00:10:00.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
Therefore, I'll assume
responsibility

00:10:00.401 --> 00:10:02.169 position:21% line:89% align:start
by leaving the team.

00:10:02.203 --> 00:10:04.105 position:35% line:83% align:start
It's done.
I'm sure that...

00:10:04.138 --> 00:10:06.107 position:16% line:83% align:start
you'll find someone else
to coach the team

in my stead, sir.

Hmm...

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:10.878 position:21% line:89% align:start
But coach Kitazume...

00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:13.280 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't you worry, Principal.

00:10:13.314 --> 00:10:14.782 position:16% line:89% align:start
You shouldn't be worried.

00:10:15.716 --> 00:10:18.085 position:30% line:83% align:start
