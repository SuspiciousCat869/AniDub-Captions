They won't let us

00:06:23.618 --> 00:06:25.119 position:24% line:89% align:start
They're very tough.

00:06:25.152 --> 00:06:26.520 position:19% line:89% align:start
Even without Tsubasa,

00:06:26.554 --> 00:06:28.388 position:19% line:83% align:start
Team Nankatsu is good
in their attack

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:29.590 position:24% line:89% align:start
and their defense.

00:06:29.624 --> 00:06:32.193 position:30% line:83% align:start
I didn't expect
anything less from Nankatsu.

00:06:32.226 --> 00:06:33.594 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's almost like they...

00:06:33.628 --> 00:06:35.529 position:19% line:83% align:start
like they didn't have
any weak points.

00:06:35.563 --> 00:06:37.098 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you thought we weren't
going to be able

00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:38.833 position:30% line:83% align:start
to do anything
without Tsubasa,

00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:39.533 position:27% line:89% align:start
you were wrong.

00:06:39.567 --> 00:06:40.801 position:27% line:83% align:start
We're a complete
entire team.

00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:43.504 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now you will know the true
strength of Nankatsu.

00:06:43.537 --> 00:06:44.639 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let 'em see it, guys!

[grunts]

00:06:49.143 --> 00:06:50.211 position:21% line:89% align:start
And to think we hide

00:06:50.244 --> 00:06:51.812 position:10% line:83% align:start
our special secret technique
from them

00:06:51.846 --> 00:06:54.081 position:24% line:83% align:start
just to make them
worry before the match.

00:06:54.115 --> 00:06:56.384 position:19% line:83% align:start
But seeing them play
like that, without Tsubasa,

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:57.484 position:19% line:89% align:start
is making me nervous.

00:06:57.518 --> 00:06:58.853 position:16% line:83% align:start
If that's how they play
without him,

how will they be playing
with him?

00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:02.256 position:27% line:89% align:start
Taki, your turn.
