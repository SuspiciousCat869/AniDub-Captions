-[Yoshiko] Yes!
-[Machiko] Yes!

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.448 position:5% line:83% align:start
My lovely wife prepared
a delicious drink for you.

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:15.517 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's energizing,

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.552 position:19% line:83% align:start

as well as honey.

00:00:17.585 --> 00:00:20.120 position:13% line:83% align:start
It'll be enough to recover
all your strength.

-Thank you!
-Thank you!

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:23.190 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's very kind of you,

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:24.792 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now we'll really be ready
for today's match.

00:00:24.826 --> 00:00:27.394 position:38% line:83% align:start
[laugh]
Exactly, kid.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:28.796 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Yoshiko]
Here Captain, it's for you.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.364 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Hikaru] Oh.
Thanks a lot.

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:32.867 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:33.868 position:21% line:89% align:start
Thank you, Yoshiko.

00:00:33.902 --> 00:00:35.335 position:13% line:89% align:start
I hadn't even realized that

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:38.540 position:10% line:83% align:start
it'll be the last tournament

[gasp]

00:00:39.974 --> 00:00:40.708 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're welcome.

00:00:43.778 --> 00:00:46.146 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Kazumasa] Ugh...
How cold.

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:47.949 position:24% line:83% align:start
Using the shovel
while wearing these clothes

00:00:47.982 --> 00:00:49.082 position:27% line:83% align:start
makes us sweat
and that makes us

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:50.484 position:10% line:89% align:start
even colder, right, captain?

00:00:50.518 --> 00:00:53.555 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Machiko] Captain, Oda,
I brought you this.

00:00:53.588 --> 00:00:54.121 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:55.389 position:16% line:89% align:start
To wipe off your sweat.

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:57.324 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Hikaru]
Thank you.

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:00.427 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Oh.
-These towels are warm.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.429 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yoshiko, put them
in front of the stove

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:03.430 position:27% line:89% align:start
to heat them up.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:06.501 position:30% line:83% align:start
Wow, honestly,
thank you so much.

[teacher] Kids, I have
some news to share.

00:01:12.674 --> 00:01:14.776 position:21% line:83% align:start
Due to the nature of
her father's work,

00:01:14.809 --> 00:01:16.376 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yoshiko Fujisawa
will be leaving

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.779 position:21% line:83% align:start
to the United States
next semester.

00:01:17.812 --> 00:01:19.514 position:41% line:83% align:start
Oh no!
She's moving?!

00:01:19.547 --> 00:01:21.315 position:35% line:89% align:start

00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:22.382 position:19% line:89% align:start
[grunt] You know what,

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:24.484 position:38% line:83% align:start
Yoshiko,
before you leave...

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:26.654 position:10% line:83% align:start
we'll give you the national
tournament's trophy

00:01:26.688 --> 00:01:27.555 position:35% line:89% align:start
as a gift.

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:29.356 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:01:31.893 --> 00:01:33.260 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Seiji] Machiko,
could I have some too?

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:35.128 position:5% line:83% align:start
Uh, yeah, sorry
about that.

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:36.531 position:5% line:89% align:start
This heat's unbearable.

00:01:36.564 --> 00:01:39.466 position:5% line:83% align:start
I hope that doesn't affect
your fighting spirit kids.

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.401 position:19% line:83% align:start
After all, you aren't
used to playing

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:43.203 position:24% line:83% align:start
in such hot weather
back home.

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.205 position:16% line:83% align:start
You don't have to worry
about us coach.

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:47.341 position:24% line:83% align:start
We've been through
worse situations.

00:01:47.374 --> 00:01:49.142 position:33% line:83% align:start
A little sun
never hurt anybody.

00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:50.477 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well said, kid.

00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:52.346 position:21% line:83% align:start
Besides, now we have
a magic potion

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:53.548 position:16% line:89% align:start
from your beloved wife.

00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:55.349 position:33% line:83% align:start
With this,
there's no way we can lose.

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:56.684 position:24% line:83% align:start
I hope you aren't
being sarcastic.

00:01:56.718 --> 00:01:57.952 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:01:57.986 --> 00:01:59.219 position:16% line:89% align:start
And don't you forget it.

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:00.420 position:19% line:89% align:start
The more we progress,

00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:02.690 position:27% line:83% align:start
the stronger your
adversaries will become.

00:02:02.724 --> 00:02:03.758 position:21% line:89% align:start
Don't get too cocky.

00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:04.692 position:5% line:89% align:start
Today, we have to play

00:02:04.726 --> 00:02:07.294 position:10% line:89% align:start
a match against Minami-uwa.

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:09.363 position:21% line:83% align:start
They're a team that's
well rounded in all aspects.

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:11.966 position:19% line:83% align:start
Their captain Ishida's
prowess is superb.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.568 position:13% line:83% align:start
And so is their forward's,
Takei.

00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:15.837 position:19% line:83% align:start
So I want you to stay
on your toes.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.105 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.906 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, then, no
matter what,

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.440 position:27% line:83% align:start
we have to win
against Minami.

00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:21.776 position:27% line:83% align:start
Only then can we
go up against

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:23.377 position:16% line:89% align:start
the notorious Nankatsu.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.478 position:30% line:83% align:start
