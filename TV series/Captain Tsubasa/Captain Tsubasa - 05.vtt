In order for you
to win the tournament,

00:00:17.585 --> 00:00:20.387 position:19% line:83% align:start
you must become friends
with the soccer ball first.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.090 position:13% line:83% align:start
Whether is having breakfast
or on the way to school,

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:25.660 position:24% line:83% align:start
you must be with it
anytime and anytime.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.531 position:13% line:83% align:start
[narrator] So, in order to
win against Genzo,

00:00:29.564 --> 00:00:32.432 position:19% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa and his friends
are hard at practice.

-Huh?

00:00:57.825 --> 00:00:59.694 position:10% line:89% align:start
I have finished my painting.

00:00:59.727 --> 00:01:01.228 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's almost time to leave.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:02.997 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hm.

00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:05.098 position:13% line:89% align:start
Are you really going away?

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:07.334 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's been only a month since
you've transferred here.

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:09.436 position:10% line:89% align:start
Can't you at least stay here

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.338 position:30% line:83% align:start
until the next
school tournament?

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.308 position:19% line:83% align:start
[boy 2] We'd be sure to
win it if you were here.

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:15.944 position:19% line:89% align:start
No, I can't stay here.

00:01:15.977 --> 00:01:17.779 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's about my father's work.

00:01:17.812 --> 00:01:19.479 position:41% line:83% align:start
[boy 1]
Oh, come on!

00:01:19.514 --> 00:01:20.515 position:44% line:89% align:start
Taro!

00:01:21.916 --> 00:01:24.184 position:30% line:83% align:start
Well, everyone.
Take care now!

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:25.553 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Aww!

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.722 position:19% line:83% align:start
-See you soon, Tarooo!
-Bye!

00:01:27.755 --> 00:01:29.857 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Come back soon!
-Bye!

00:01:29.891 --> 00:01:31.693 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, poor Taro...

00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:33.427 position:13% line:89% align:start
I really feel bad for him.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.295 position:27% line:83% align:start
I understand that
his father is a painter

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.197 position:24% line:83% align:start
who travels around
the country.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.465 position:21% line:83% align:start
[boy 1] But he had to
transfer schools

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:41.569 position:24% line:83% align:start
over 30 times just
in elementary school.

00:01:41.603 --> 00:01:44.572 position:19% line:83% align:start
If that's how it goes,
he won't ever make friends.

I'm sorry that you had to
go train with him

00:04:21.162 --> 00:04:22.864 position:16% line:89% align:start
so early in the morning.

00:04:22.897 --> 00:04:23.463 position:35% line:89% align:start
No problem.

00:04:23.497 --> 00:04:24.799 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Mrs. Ozora]
Really...

00:04:24.832 --> 00:04:26.934 position:19% line:83% align:start
When it's about soccer,
he can't see anything else.

00:04:26.968 --> 00:04:30.538 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just say no if he asks
for something impossible.

00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:32.774 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Roberto] It's okay...
It was actually me who...

00:04:32.807 --> 00:04:35.209 position:27% line:83% align:start
proposed to have
an early morning practice.

00:04:35.243 --> 00:04:37.512 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh... Is that so?

Oh...

00:04:39.814 --> 00:04:42.784 position:19% line:83% align:start

you don't have to worry.

haven't you?

00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:48.222 position:24% line:89% align:start
Um... I'm so sorry.

00:04:48.256 --> 00:04:49.991 position:10% line:89% align:start

 <i>Mr. Roberto Hongo.</i>

00:04:55.196 --> 00:04:57.765 position:30% line:83% align:start
The real reason
why I came here...

00:04:57.799 --> 00:04:59.700 position:21% line:83% align:start
was to be examined by
the specialist

00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:02.003 position:24% line:83% align:start
that Captain Ozora
recommended.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.372 position:27% line:83% align:start
You already know
how that turned out.

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:07.842 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll never be able to
return to the pitch again.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.146 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've informed my team about
my intention to retire.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.380 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:17.084 position:21% line:83% align:start

enjoying being a coach.

[Roberto] Yes.
He is something else...

00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:24.725 position:41% line:89% align:start
He is.

00:05:25.726 --> 00:05:27.829 position:21% line:83% align:start
The more I teach him,
the better he gets.

00:05:27.862 --> 00:05:28.796 position:19% line:89% align:start
If I keep training him,

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.498 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm sure I will forget
about my condition.

Mizukoshi Elementary.

00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:30.651 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, the guys from
the soccer club

00:07:30.685 --> 00:07:32.586 position:13% line:89% align:start
were talking about a match

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.389 position:21% line:83% align:start
they would have with
Shutetsu after school...

00:07:35.423 --> 00:07:35.656 position:41% line:89% align:start

It's on the other side

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:43.030 position:19% line:89% align:start
I had no other choice.

00:07:43.064 --> 00:07:45.700 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Manabu] The ball just
didn't want to listen to me.

00:07:45.733 --> 00:07:47.467 position:19% line:89% align:start
But... Thanks to that,

00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:50.905 position:19% line:83% align:start
I was able to find out
about the practice match.

00:07:50.938 --> 00:07:51.572 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh...

00:07:51.605 --> 00:07:53.473 position:13% line:89% align:start
Let's go watch it, Tsubasa.

00:07:53.507 --> 00:07:55.076 position:13% line:89% align:start

I hear he's not in school

00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:49.663 position:19% line:83% align:start

00:08:51.132 --> 00:08:53.502 position:21% line:83% align:start
Apparently, the goal
Tsubasa scored on him

00:08:53.534 --> 00:08:55.336 position:27% line:83% align:start
left him in shock

to be such a weak team.

-[Roberto] Come on!

00:13:17.498 --> 00:13:18.600 position:19% line:89% align:start
Is that all you've got?

00:13:18.633 --> 00:13:21.670 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:13:21.703 --> 00:13:23.571 position:41% line:83% align:start
Oohhh!
That's pretty good.

00:13:23.605 --> 00:13:27.676 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[grunting]
-Come on now! [laughs]

00:13:27.709 --> 00:13:28.643 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yell]

00:13:28.677 --> 00:13:30.044 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ah!
-I did it!

00:13:30.077 --> 00:13:31.478 position:38% line:89% align:start
[panting]

00:13:31.513 --> 00:13:33.080 position:33% line:89% align:start
How was that?

00:13:33.113 --> 00:13:36.183 position:16% line:83% align:start
You are making tremendous
progress, Tsubasa.

00:13:36.216 --> 00:13:37.284 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right!

00:13:37.318 --> 00:13:40.588 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now then, let's practice
some different curve shots!

00:13:40.622 --> 00:13:42.489 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[Ryo] Tsubasa! Coach!
-Oh?

00:13:45.893 --> 00:13:49.196 position:16% line:83% align:start
We want to train just as
hard as Tsubasa is, Coach!

00:13:49.229 --> 00:13:50.799 position:27% line:83% align:start
I know we whined
a lot yesterday,

00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:52.833 position:35% line:83% align:start
but today,
we really want to win

00:13:52.866 --> 00:13:54.736 position:10% line:89% align:start
against Shutetsu, all right?

00:13:54.769 --> 00:13:56.270 position:21% line:89% align:start
Please train us too!

00:13:56.303 --> 00:13:58.540 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KENICHI] We'll come early
every morning.

00:13:58.573 --> 00:13:59.741 position:38% line:89% align:start
You guys!

00:13:59.774 --> 00:14:00.974 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:14:01.576 --> 00:14:02.711 position:35% line:89% align:start
Very well!

00:14:02.744 --> 00:14:04.278 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Everyone, get in position!
-Ah!

00:14:04.311 --> 00:14:06.681 position:16% line:83% align:start
We'll start some training
until the tournament!

00:14:06.715 --> 00:14:08.616 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Yay!
-Yay!

00:14:09.584 --> 00:14:10.984 position:24% line:83% align:start
Pass it over here!
Over here!

00:14:11.018 --> 00:14:15.389 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Kenichi]
[panting]

00:14:15.422 --> 00:14:16.558 position:38% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa!

00:14:17.826 --> 00:14:19.860 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're putting too much
pressure on your legs!

00:14:19.893 --> 00:14:21.495 position:30% line:83% align:start
Relax and focus
your strength

00:14:21.529 --> 00:14:22.731 position:16% line:89% align:start
at the moment of impact!

00:14:22.764 --> 00:14:23.397 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right!

00:14:24.131 --> 00:14:26.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Tsuyoshi] I got it!
[grunts]

00:14:26.668 --> 00:14:27.935 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Oh!
-[Ryo] I'll take this!

00:14:27.968 --> 00:14:29.671 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ah!
-Plan your next move

00:14:29.704 --> 00:14:30.572 position:13% line:89% align:start
before you get to the ball!

00:14:30.605 --> 00:14:33.107 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Stay alert!
-Yes, sir!

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.975 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Roberto] Stand firmly to
allow your support leg

00:14:35.008 --> 00:14:36.143 position:24% line:89% align:start
to be your axis...

00:14:36.176 --> 00:14:38.345 position:35% line:83% align:start
Then rotate
your body, and kick.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.114 position:33% line:89% align:start
Stand firmly,

00:14:40.147 --> 00:14:41.448 position:27% line:83% align:start
rotate your body,
and kick.

00:14:41.482 --> 00:14:44.084 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Roberto] You have to allow
the movements to flow.

00:14:44.118 --> 00:14:46.086 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Give it a try.
-Yes, sir!

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.555 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Manabu]
Stand firmly...

00:14:47.589 --> 00:14:49.123 position:30% line:89% align:start
Rotate body...

00:14:49.156 --> 00:14:50.157 position:38% line:89% align:start
And kick!

00:14:50.525 --> 00:14:51.125 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aww!

00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:54.729 position:16% line:83% align:start
Nice try! Keep practicing
and you'll improve.

00:14:54.763 --> 00:14:55.963 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:14:57.297 --> 00:14:58.499 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:14:58.533 --> 00:14:59.667 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kenichi!

00:14:59.701 --> 00:15:00.901 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:02.537 position:27% line:83% align:start
Pay attention to
your teammates!

00:15:05.472 --> 00:15:06.907 position:38% line:89% align:start
[whimper]

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.442 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Move faster!
-Okay!

00:15:09.476 --> 00:15:10.477 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Roberto]
Next!

00:15:11.513 --> 00:15:12.747 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:15:12.781 --> 00:15:15.115 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[Roberto] Next!
-[panting]

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.424 position:19% line:89% align:start
Wow, how'd you do that?

00:15:24.526 --> 00:15:26.927 position:16% line:83% align:start
Just try to kick the ball
at an angle to spin it.

00:15:30.431 --> 00:15:34.268 position:33% line:83% align:start
Stand firmly,
rotate body, and kick!

00:15:34.301 --> 00:15:35.703 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wow, I did it!

00:15:36.871 --> 00:15:38.939 position:35% line:83% align:start
This'll be
our game strategy...

00:15:44.712 --> 00:15:45.513 position:38% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa!

00:15:45.547 --> 00:15:47.047 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ah... [grunt]

00:15:47.582 --> 00:15:48.583 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:15:49.283 --> 00:15:50.652 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:16:08.736 --> 00:16:10.471 position:13% line:89% align:start
Tomorrow's finally the day!

00:16:13.575 --> 00:16:15.242 position:24% line:89% align:start
This feels so good.

00:16:16.611 --> 00:16:17.712 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:16:21.549 --> 00:16:22.617 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right!

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.519 position:30% line:89% align:start
Stand firmly...

00:16:24.552 --> 00:16:26.588 position:19% line:89% align:start
Rotate body, and kick!

00:16:28.756 --> 00:16:30.257 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:16:34.863 --> 00:16:36.764 position:38% line:89% align:start
I did it!

00:16:38.867 --> 00:16:40.768 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:16:40.802 --> 00:16:41.903 position:33% line:89% align:start
Good morning!

00:16:41.936 --> 00:16:43.036 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.171 position:35% line:89% align:start
Move away!

00:16:44.204 --> 00:16:46.306 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even Manabu isn't late
to school anymore.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.409 position:16% line:83% align:start
Everyone seems so easily
to make it on time.

00:16:49.443 --> 00:16:51.713 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is the result
of all our practices.

00:16:51.746 --> 00:16:53.180 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's all thanks
to our coach.

00:16:53.213 --> 00:16:55.382 position:19% line:83% align:start
You guys... We can win
the game tomorrow!

00:16:55.415 --> 00:16:56.818 position:33% line:83% align:start
The guys from
the soccer club

00:16:56.851 --> 00:16:58.085 position:21% line:89% align:start
are in high spirits.

00:16:58.118 --> 00:17:00.922 position:13% line:83% align:start
They always used to give up
without even trying.

00:17:00.955 --> 00:17:03.525 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah... They say that
they'll win this year.

00:17:03.558 --> 00:17:05.527 position:16% line:83% align:start
I hear they're practicing
all the time

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.761 position:19% line:89% align:start
and not even sleeping!

00:17:06.794 --> 00:17:08.395 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?!
-Huh?!

00:17:08.428 --> 00:17:10.665 position:19% line:83% align:start
Still, what's the point
of coming to school

00:17:10.698 --> 00:17:11.766 position:24% line:89% align:start
dribbling the ball?

00:17:11.799 --> 00:17:13.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
I think they just
like to show off.

00:17:13.635 --> 00:17:14.669 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[Sanae] Be quiet!
-Ouch!

00:17:14.702 --> 00:17:18.305 position:16% line:83% align:start
I won't allow you to make
fun of our soccer club!

00:17:18.338 --> 00:17:20.508 position:27% line:83% align:start
[boy] I'm sorry,
I won't do it again!

00:17:20.542 --> 00:17:22.977 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:17:23.011 --> 00:17:24.579 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]
[squeal]

00:17:24.612 --> 00:17:26.748 position:19% line:89% align:start
He looks amazing today.

00:17:26.781 --> 00:17:28.248 position:41% line:83% align:start
-[sigh]
-[sigh]

00:17:29.182 --> 00:17:30.518 position:30% line:83% align:start
The tournament
starts tomorrow!

00:17:30.552 --> 00:17:32.854 position:27% line:83% align:start
We will practice
until the day is over!

00:17:32.887 --> 00:17:34.321 position:38% line:83% align:start
[student]
All right!

00:17:34.354 --> 00:17:35.924 position:24% line:83% align:start
[kendo] Put all of
your effort into practice!

00:17:35.957 --> 00:17:37.057 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Even our lousy soccer club
-Yeah!

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.325 position:24% line:83% align:start
-is still training.
-Pass it over here!

00:17:38.358 --> 00:17:39.794 position:13% line:83% align:start
-This year, we have to win,
-Come on, over here!

00:17:39.827 --> 00:17:41.696 position:16% line:89% align:start
no matter what it takes!

00:17:41.729 --> 00:17:43.130 position:30% line:89% align:start
Truly amazing.

00:17:43.163 --> 00:17:45.934 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've never seen the students
so motivated before.

00:17:45.967 --> 00:17:46.834 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mhm...

00:17:47.735 --> 00:17:48.636 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Aw, come on!
-Win! Win!

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:50.972 position:21% line:83% align:start
And even the Nankatsu
cheerleading squad

00:17:51.005 --> 00:17:51.973 position:33% line:89% align:start
is fired up!

00:17:52.006 --> 00:17:53.608 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]
Tsubasa!

00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:54.976 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's that?

00:17:55.009 --> 00:17:57.712 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Koji] Sanae, enough already
with Tsubasa!

00:17:57.745 --> 00:18:00.715 position:24% line:83% align:start
We have to cheer on
all the other athletes too!

00:18:00.748 --> 00:18:02.050 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Don't you dare!
-Whoa!

00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:03.785 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are you questioning
my leadership?

00:18:03.818 --> 00:18:04.786 position:30% line:89% align:start
She's lost it.

00:18:05.653 --> 00:18:06.888 position:38% line:83% align:start
Come on,
get back to work!

00:18:06.921 --> 00:18:07.989 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Uhh...
-Uhh...

00:18:08.022 --> 00:18:08.957 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]
Hurry up!

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.124 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Hooray! Hooray!
-Hooray! Hooray!

00:18:11.158 --> 00:18:13.027 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Tsu-ba-sa!
-Tsu-ba-sa!

00:18:13.061 --> 00:18:14.428 position:27% line:89% align:start
I can't hear you!

00:18:14.461 --> 00:18:16.163 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Hooray! Hooray!
-Hooray! Hooray!

00:18:16.196 --> 00:18:18.131 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Tsu-ba-sa!
-Tsu-ba-sa!

00:18:20.768 --> 00:18:22.604 position:41% line:89% align:start
Whoa...

00:18:23.538 --> 00:18:27.041 position:44% line:83% align:start
What?
Tsubasa as a goalkeeper?

00:18:27.075 --> 00:18:28.275 position:19% line:89% align:start
Listen to me carefully.

00:18:28.308 --> 00:18:29.343 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is my last lesson

00:18:29.376 --> 00:18:32.212 position:19% line:83% align:start
before the inter-school
tournament.

00:18:32.245 --> 00:18:33.748 position:24% line:89% align:start
Get ready, Tsubasa!

00:18:33.781 --> 00:18:35.617 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh! Uh...

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.284 position:19% line:89% align:start
Is he really shooting?

00:18:39.386 --> 00:18:40.420 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yell]

00:18:43.323 --> 00:18:44.792 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Whoa!
-So fast!

00:18:44.826 --> 00:18:47.028 position:16% line:89% align:start
It is impossible to stop.

00:18:47.061 --> 00:18:48.395 position:13% line:89% align:start
What's the matter, Tsubasa?

00:18:48.428 --> 00:18:50.765 position:21% line:83% align:start
You have to at least
try to react!

00:18:50.798 --> 00:18:51.899 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh!

00:18:51.933 --> 00:18:53.433 position:35% line:89% align:start
Once more!

[grunts]

00:18:58.138 --> 00:18:59.507 position:16% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa is not even close

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.776 position:21% line:83% align:start
to reaching the ball
in time.

00:19:01.809 --> 00:19:04.478 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Masato] We're really lucky
to have such a good player

00:19:04.512 --> 00:19:05.647 position:33% line:89% align:start
as our coach.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.581 position:38% line:89% align:start
Awesome!

00:19:06.614 --> 00:19:09.784 position:27% line:83% align:start
This is the power
of a real pro player!

Oh my gosh! These shots
are definitely unstoppable!

00:19:27.535 --> 00:19:28.636 position:44% line:89% align:start
 <i>Oh!</i>

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.370 position:19% line:89% align:start
How about another one?

00:19:30.404 --> 00:19:31.371 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:19:31.806 --> 00:19:32.472 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right!

00:19:36.309 --> 00:19:38.245 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Thank you very much, Coach!
-Thank you very much, Coach!

00:19:41.149 --> 00:19:43.718 position:10% line:89% align:start
Genzo still hasn't shown up.

00:19:43.751 --> 00:19:44.752 position:19% line:89% align:start
I wonder if he's okay.

00:19:44.786 --> 00:19:45.787 position:16% line:89% align:start
We have a game tomorrow.

00:19:46.621 --> 00:19:47.722 position:33% line:89% align:start
Relax, guys.

00:19:47.755 --> 00:19:48.856 position:16% line:89% align:start
We're up against Nankatsu

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.825 position:30% line:83% align:start
who we already
defeated 30 to 0.

00:19:50.858 --> 00:19:53.761 position:13% line:83% align:start
We'll easily win if we just
mark that Tsubasa guy,

00:19:53.795 --> 00:19:56.030 position:16% line:83% align:start
the one who scored a goal
against our captain.

00:19:56.064 --> 00:19:57.098 position:27% line:89% align:start
I totally agree.

00:19:57.131 --> 00:19:58.700 position:13% line:89% align:start
It'll be easy an easy win.

00:20:01.069 --> 00:20:03.004 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right!
Great job, guys!

00:20:03.037 --> 00:20:04.438 position:19% line:89% align:start
Tomorrow's the big day.

00:20:04.471 --> 00:20:06.507 position:16% line:89% align:start
You've trained very hard.

00:20:06.541 --> 00:20:09.209 position:35% line:83% align:start
Go home and
get some rest.

00:20:09.242 --> 00:20:10.578 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

00:20:10.611 --> 00:20:11.311 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

-That was a good

00:20:13.815 --> 00:20:14.949 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.
-Me too!

00:20:14.982 --> 00:20:16.918 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's go get something
to eat!

00:20:16.951 --> 00:20:17.284 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good idea.

00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:20.755 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've learned to lift
and control the ball now.

00:20:20.788 --> 00:20:21.856 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's really great!

[laughs]

00:20:33.067 --> 00:20:35.103 position:38% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa,
did you figure it out?

00:20:35.136 --> 00:20:36.137 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.906 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why I made you play
as a goalkeeper.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:39.607 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah!

00:20:40.541 --> 00:20:42.442 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now I get which shots
are hard to stop.

00:20:42.476 --> 00:20:44.545 position:24% line:89% align:start
For a goalkeeper...

00:20:44.579 --> 00:20:47.347 position:21% line:83% align:start
some shots are harder
to see than other shots.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.517 position:21% line:83% align:start
And it's hard to know
which way to jump.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.919 position:30% line:83% align:start
But in the end,
I didn't stop any of them.

00:20:51.953 --> 00:20:53.453 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:20:53.855 --> 00:20:55.056 position:35% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa...

00:20:55.089 --> 00:20:56.958 position:13% line:89% align:start
Every time to make a shot,

00:20:56.991 --> 00:20:59.326 position:19% line:89% align:start
think as a goalkeeper.

00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:02.362 position:13% line:83% align:start
By doing that, you'll know
where to shoot tomorrow.

00:21:02.395 --> 00:21:04.699 position:35% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa...
The team needs you!

00:21:04.732 --> 00:21:07.735 position:19% line:83% align:start
I know! I'll do my best
to help us win!

00:21:07.769 --> 00:21:08.736 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's the spirit!

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.772 position:21% line:83% align:start
Show them the results
of your training.

00:21:10.805 --> 00:21:12.840 position:16% line:89% align:start
Give Genzo a great match!

00:21:12.874 --> 00:21:13.741 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right!

00:21:13.775 --> 00:21:16.476 position:35% line:83% align:start
I promise!
We will win tomorrow!

00:21:48.609 --> 00:21:50.545 position:16% line:89% align:start
I wonder who that boy is?

00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:53.714 position:13% line:89% align:start

-Incredible!

00:22:26.346 --> 00:22:28.182 position:35% line:83% align:start
He stopped
two shots at a time...
