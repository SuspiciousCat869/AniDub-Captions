This is what coach said!

Oh, this is great!

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.029 position:21% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa and the boys
actually won!

00:18:48.062 --> 00:18:49.262 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:49.998 --> 00:18:51.198 position:27% line:89% align:start
Where did he go?

00:18:55.069 --> 00:18:56.604 position:38% line:83% align:start
But why?
[sobs]

00:18:56.638 --> 00:18:58.906 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can't believe we got
knocked out!

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.341 position:24% line:83% align:start
Kazuo, we all gave
our best effort!

00:19:01.375 --> 00:19:03.978 position:24% line:83% align:start
You should be proud
of yourself!

00:19:04.012 --> 00:19:05.113 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, you're right!

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:06.179 position:21% line:83% align:start

You played well, Hanawa!

00:19:12.787 --> 00:19:14.055 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey, listen, Tsubasa.

00:19:14.088 --> 00:19:16.490 position:19% line:83% align:start
We want you guys to win
the tournament.

00:19:16.524 --> 00:19:17.525 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:20:18.986 --> 00:20:20.988 position:44% line:83% align:start
Yes.
Once I finish this semester,

00:20:21.022 --> 00:20:23.024 position:30% line:83% align:start
I will study at
another place, guys.

00:20:23.057 --> 00:20:24.224 position:33% line:89% align:start
What a shame.

00:20:24.792 --> 00:20:25.325 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:25.358 --> 00:20:26.627 position:33% line:89% align:start
In that case,

we'll make sure that we win
the tournament together.

That'd be incredible!

Just relax, Taro,

00:20:31.999 --> 00:20:33.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
we will take care

They're from Furano!

00:20:43.811 --> 00:20:44.545 position:19% line:89% align:start
I came to tell you that

00:20:44.579 --> 00:20:46.647 position:16% line:83% align:start
you played stupendously,
Taro.

00:20:46.681 --> 00:20:49.483 position:13% line:83% align:start
And, looking at the bracket
for the matches...

00:20:49.517 --> 00:20:50.752 position:16% line:89% align:start
we don't play each other,

unless we both make it
to the final.

Ah!
Yeah, that's right!

00:20:55.355 --> 00:20:56.691 position:27% line:83% align:start
Make sure to win
your next match,

00:20:56.724 --> 00:20:58.860 position:30% line:83% align:start
so we can play
against you guys.

Of course we will!

not playing like this joker!

What?

00:21:37.031 --> 00:21:38.833 position:41% line:83% align:start
If not,
it'll be more humiliating

00:21:38.866 --> 00:21:39.867 position:27% line:89% align:start
when we beat you!

00:21:39.901 --> 00:21:41.169 position:27% line:89% align:start
What did you say?

Wise words from a captain.

Don't you think
it'd be a pity
