00:06:19.547 --> 00:06:21.315 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm... I'm sorry!

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:22.550 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[grunt]
-Huh?

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:26.220 position:44% line:83% align:start
[Ryo]
[gulping]

00:06:26.254 --> 00:06:27.822 position:41% line:89% align:start
[laugh]

00:06:27.855 --> 00:06:28.956 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, guys,

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.792 position:16% line:83% align:start
this new team is supposed
to be really strong, right?

00:06:31.826 --> 00:06:34.494 position:27% line:83% align:start
If Tsubasa, Taro,
and Genzo are in it,

00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:36.530 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm sure we'll win
the national tournament.

00:06:36.564 --> 00:06:39.533 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yeah! With them,
we will win for sure!

00:06:39.567 --> 00:06:40.433 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Taro]
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:41.636 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:43.771 position:13% line:83% align:start
All the teams participating
in the tournament

00:06:43.804 --> 00:06:44.739 position:30% line:89% align:start
are very good.

00:06:44.772 --> 00:06:45.740 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, I get it!

00:06:45.773 --> 00:06:47.208 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're saying that because
you've played with

00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:48.542 position:13% line:89% align:start
most of them before, right?

00:06:48.576 --> 00:06:50.044 position:38% line:83% align:start
Exactly.
For example,

00:06:50.077 --> 00:06:51.045 position:27% line:83% align:start
against the team
from Chiba...

00:06:52.046 --> 00:06:54.015 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Taro] They train every day
on the beach,

00:06:54.048 --> 00:06:55.516 position:13% line:89% align:start
and they are really strong.

00:06:55.549 --> 00:06:58.319 position:24% line:83% align:start
They are considered
the fastest and strongesy

00:06:58.352 --> 00:06:59.486 position:24% line:89% align:start
players there are.

00:07:00.655 --> 00:07:04.058 position:13% line:83% align:start
The Naniwa team from Osaka
has the tallest players,

00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:05.026 position:21% line:89% align:start
and because of that,

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:07.662 position:24% line:83% align:start
they are experts at
intercepting the ball.

00:07:07.695 --> 00:07:10.965 position:10% line:83% align:start
The Hakata team from Fukuoka
has members of all ages

00:07:10.998 --> 00:07:13.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
and they take advantage
of what they learn

00:07:13.401 --> 00:07:15.102 position:33% line:83% align:start
and they are
very unpredictable.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.973 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wow! There sure are many
different kinds of teams.

00:07:19.006 --> 00:07:20.041 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah, many.

00:07:20.074 --> 00:07:22.209 position:21% line:83% align:start
If we manage to go to
the national tournament...

00:07:22.243 --> 00:07:24.245 position:19% line:83% align:start
our strongest opponent
will surely be

00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:26.180 position:30% line:83% align:start
the Meiwa team
from Showa...

00:07:26.213 --> 00:07:28.215 position:19% line:83% align:start
Its captain's last name
is Hyuga.

00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:29.750 position:19% line:89% align:start
He is really strong...

00:07:29.784 --> 00:07:32.853 position:19% line:83% align:start
with skills that almost
match Tsubasa's skills.

00:07:32.887 --> 00:07:33.621 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
What?!

00:07:33.654 --> 00:07:35.256 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's impossible!

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:37.091 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's no way
he matches Tsubasa!

00:07:37.124 --> 00:07:38.359 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's the only one
that managed

00:07:38.392 --> 00:07:39.994 position:16% line:89% align:start
to score a goal to Genzo!

00:07:40.027 --> 00:07:41.529 position:21% line:89% align:start
Kojiro is a striker.

00:07:41.562 --> 00:07:43.130 position:19% line:89% align:start
A very different type.

00:07:43.164 --> 00:07:44.398 position:16% line:89% align:start
His nature and game style

00:07:44.432 --> 00:07:46.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
is very different
than yours.

00:07:47.368 --> 00:07:48.669 position:30% line:89% align:start
 <i>Kojiro Hyuga,</i>

00:08:05.086 --> 00:08:06.420 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hi, Genzo!

00:08:06.454 --> 00:08:09.290 position:27% line:83% align:start
I suppose you're
heading home, right?

00:08:09.323 --> 00:08:10.725 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Genzo]
What happened to you, Ryo?

00:08:10.758 --> 00:08:12.193 position:10% line:89% align:start
You look a little beaten up.

00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:13.194 position:35% line:89% align:start
Am I right?

00:08:13.227 --> 00:08:14.295 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just shut up!

00:08:14.328 --> 00:08:16.197 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's only because
I trained really hard

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.698 position:16% line:89% align:start
for the try outs, okay?!

00:08:17.732 --> 00:08:20.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
But without any talent,
the effort is pointless.

00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:22.536 position:33% line:83% align:start
Come here and
I'll show you my talent!

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.039 position:35% line:89% align:start
[groaning]

00:08:25.072 --> 00:08:26.040 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's the matter?

00:08:27.408 --> 00:08:29.210 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's nothing.
Don't worry, I'm fine.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.385 position:30% line:83% align:start
You know what,
Roberto?

00:08:37.418 --> 00:08:39.353 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't wait to meet
that kid, Kojiro.

00:08:39.387 --> 00:08:42.289 position:33% line:83% align:start
Taro told me
he's nothing like you.

00:08:42.323 --> 00:08:43.924 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I'll tell you,
just like him...

00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.394 position:21% line:83% align:start
all the other players
are very different.

00:08:46.427 --> 00:08:47.661 position:30% line:89% align:start
I believe you.

00:08:48.462 --> 00:08:49.530 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm sure that in Brazil

00:08:49.563 --> 00:08:51.832 position:30% line:83% align:start
the players are
very different too.

00:08:51.866 --> 00:08:53.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you come to Brazil,
you won't get back

00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:55.903 position:24% line:83% align:start
until you've become
a professional player.

00:08:55.936 --> 00:08:56.937 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:08:56.971 --> 00:08:58.906 position:19% line:83% align:start
No matter what, I'll be
a professional player!

00:08:58.939 --> 00:09:00.641 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's my dream
and I won't stop

00:09:00.674 --> 00:09:01.942 position:19% line:89% align:start
until I finally get it!

00:09:01.976 --> 00:09:03.778 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then I'll be able to play
soccer every day!

00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:07.114 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yes, but first, you must
qualify for and win

00:09:07.148 --> 00:09:08.349 position:16% line:89% align:start
the national tournament.

00:09:08.382 --> 00:09:11.285 position:13% line:83% align:start
Otherwise, you won't get to
come with me to Brazil.

00:09:11.318 --> 00:09:12.887 position:38% line:83% align:start
I'll win
the national tournament!

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:13.454 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm...

00:09:13.487 --> 00:09:14.989 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's not that easy.

00:09:20.227 --> 00:09:21.228 position:33% line:89% align:start
Look closely.

00:09:27.134 --> 00:09:30.371 position:24% line:83% align:start
A professional must
be able to do this.

00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:30.671 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:09:31.739 --> 00:09:34.842 position:19% line:83% align:start
Of course, you're still
very young to do this.

00:09:34.875 --> 00:09:36.877 position:24% line:83% align:start
Your bones haven't
fully developed yet.

00:09:36.911 --> 00:09:39.514 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you try this,
you'll only hurt yourself.

00:09:39.548 --> 00:09:41.215 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I get it.

00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:42.450 position:33% line:89% align:start
By the way...

00:09:42.483 --> 00:09:43.150 position:30% line:89% align:start
About Genzo...

00:09:43.984 --> 00:09:45.219 position:24% line:83% align:start
I want to tell you
that I noticed

00:09:45.252 --> 00:09:48.055 position:19% line:83% align:start
he was slightly limping
on one of his legs.

in the following way,

00:10:08.442 --> 00:10:09.710 position:33% line:83% align:start
since we have
a lot of players

00:10:09.743 --> 00:10:11.045 position:19% line:89% align:start

Don't tell me that's...

00:11:38.132 --> 00:11:40.535 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's Kojiro, the captain
of the Meiwa team!

00:11:40.569 --> 00:11:42.203 position:13% line:89% align:start
What do we do now, Captain?

I'll accept his challenge.

you were talking about.

00:12:11.098 --> 00:12:13.867 position:24% line:83% align:start
His style really is
very different.

00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:16.270 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's right. If we think of
you as kind when playing,

00:12:16.303 --> 00:12:18.839 position:19% line:83% align:start

You know what?

00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:38.085 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you're part of this team,
then you should...

00:13:38.118 --> 00:13:39.420 position:30% line:83% align:start
just tell them

of the national tournament

00:13:40.454 --> 00:13:43.591 position:30% line:83% align:start

00:17:01.823 --> 00:17:03.490 position:19% line:89% align:start
before going to Brazil.

00:17:03.525 --> 00:17:04.491 position:27% line:89% align:start
And what is that?

00:17:04.526 --> 00:17:07.227 position:19% line:83% align:start
That if he doesn't win
the national tournament,

00:17:07.261 --> 00:17:09.931 position:16% line:83% align:start
then he won't be able to
come with me to Brazil.

00:17:09.964 --> 00:17:11.365 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's quite a challenge!

00:17:11.398 --> 00:17:13.935 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I don't think there
will be any problem!

00:17:13.968 --> 00:17:17.005 position:24% line:83% align:start

Thanks, Dad!
Really!

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:19.874 position:27% line:89% align:start
Listen, Tsubasa,

00:17:19.908 --> 00:17:22.677 position:16% line:83% align:start
I want you to promise me
something too.

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:23.143 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:24.144 --> 00:17:26.514 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you can score three goals
on today's game,

00:17:26.548 --> 00:17:29.082 position:27% line:83% align:start
then I'll let you
go to Brazil, got it?

00:17:29.116 --> 00:17:30.217 position:24% line:83% align:start
I thought you said
that he could

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.219 position:21% line:83% align:start
go to Brazil already,
though, huh?

00:17:32.252 --> 00:17:33.955 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yes, darling, but I need to
make sure of

00:17:33.988 --> 00:17:36.089 position:13% line:89% align:start
his commitment to the trip.

00:17:36.123 --> 00:17:37.324 position:30% line:89% align:start
Of course, Dad!

00:17:37.357 --> 00:17:40.227 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll do my very best to
score those three goals!

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.631 position:16% line:83% align:start

the moment on tape!

00:17:43.665 --> 00:17:45.934 position:27% line:83% align:start

00:17:45.967 --> 00:17:47.936 position:33% line:83% align:start
the last game
of Tsubasa in Japan.

00:17:47.969 --> 00:17:49.169 position:41% line:89% align:start

[Kojiro] What? Didn't I
tell you to play and win

00:18:00.014 --> 00:18:02.115 position:19% line:83% align:start
the national tournament
on your own?

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:04.284 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:18:04.318 --> 00:18:06.119 position:30% line:83% align:start
since you don't
want me to play,

00:18:06.153 --> 00:18:08.155 position:19% line:83% align:start
let's see how you do it
on your own.

00:18:09.924 --> 00:18:11.893 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why is he always
so stubborn?

00:18:11.926 --> 00:18:13.695 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now what are we gonna do?

00:18:13.728 --> 00:18:15.228 position:16% line:89% align:start
We can't win without him.

00:18:15.262 --> 00:18:17.230 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't understand why
he is risking everything

00:18:17.264 --> 00:18:18.498 position:24% line:83% align:start
knowing what he got
on the line.

00:18:18.533 --> 00:18:20.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Doesn't he care?
-What's on the line?

00:18:20.434 --> 00:18:22.269 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, it's just that
I heard that

00:18:22.302 --> 00:18:24.404 position:27% line:83% align:start
the captain's dad
died last year.

Yeah and that's not all...

00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:29.577 position:24% line:83% align:start
I heard his mom has
several jobs now

00:18:29.611 --> 00:18:32.212 position:13% line:83% align:start
to provide for the captain
and all his siblings.

00:18:32.245 --> 00:18:34.549 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't know why he risks
everything like that.

to win the tournament

a professional player.

00:18:39.087 --> 00:18:41.022 position:21% line:83% align:start

with this.

I understand!

00:18:43.457 --> 00:18:44.993 position:21% line:83% align:start
He has to win because
there'll be

00:18:45.026 --> 00:18:46.894 position:30% line:83% align:start
tons of scouts
in the national tournament!
