00:19:35.409 --> 00:19:37.078 position:13% line:89% align:start
 <i>I'll send them to Europe,</i>

00:19:37.111 --> 00:19:40.313 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>so they can prove</i>
 <i>their skills in soccer.</i>

00:19:41.783 --> 00:19:43.651 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now let me see your foot.

00:19:43.685 --> 00:19:44.919 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Tsubasa...

00:19:44.952 --> 00:19:46.954 position:30% line:83% align:start
Don't you dare
play dumb with me.

00:19:46.988 --> 00:19:48.756 position:10% line:89% align:start
You can't fool this old man.

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:50.457 position:10% line:89% align:start
I know your foot is injured.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:51.993 position:13% line:89% align:start
Doctor, I swear it's fine.

00:19:52.026 --> 00:19:53.961 position:24% line:83% align:start
Stop being stubborn
and let me see it.

00:19:53.995 --> 00:19:55.129 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's this?

00:19:55.163 --> 00:19:57.098 position:16% line:83% align:start
I see you already had it
wrapped, young man.

00:19:57.131 --> 00:19:58.365 position:35% line:89% align:start
I told you.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.399 position:41% line:89% align:start
And...

00:19:59.433 --> 00:20:01.069 position:19% line:83% align:start
it's a superb wrapping
at that.

00:20:01.102 --> 00:20:03.004 position:38% line:83% align:start
Tell me,
was it your dear manager

00:20:03.037 --> 00:20:04.237 position:27% line:89% align:start
or someone else?

00:20:04.271 --> 00:20:06.974 position:44% line:83% align:start
Um...
I think it was...

00:20:07.008 --> 00:20:08.943 position:27% line:83% align:start
What do you mean
you think, young man?

00:20:08.976 --> 00:20:09.944 position:38% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:20:09.977 --> 00:20:11.746 position:35% line:83% align:start
-That hurt!
-Don't be a shy guy

00:20:11.779 --> 00:20:12.647 position:21% line:89% align:start
and enjoy your youth

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.481 position:16% line:83% align:start
while you still have it,
you fool!

00:20:14.515 --> 00:20:15.248 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[cheering]
-Yeah, man,

00:20:15.282 --> 00:20:16.483 position:19% line:89% align:start
I know they can do it.

00:20:16.517 --> 00:20:19.120 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now it's the match between
Team Chubu and Toho.

00:20:19.153 --> 00:20:20.822 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Hiroshi]
Yukari, how're you doing?

00:20:20.855 --> 00:20:22.322 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Hiroshi?

00:20:22.355 --> 00:20:24.058 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's Jito from Team Hirado.

00:20:24.092 --> 00:20:25.993 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm glad to see
you skated by

00:20:26.027 --> 00:20:27.762 position:19% line:83% align:start
with a win in the end,
Team Nankatsu.

00:20:27.795 --> 00:20:28.730 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Uhh...
-Hey, what the hell are you

00:20:28.763 --> 00:20:29.797 position:19% line:89% align:start
talking about, cousin?

00:20:29.831 --> 00:20:33.266 position:16% line:83% align:start
You only won your matches
by a one goal difference.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.636 position:35% line:83% align:start
Oh, Yukari,
that doesn't really matter.

00:20:36.771 --> 00:20:38.338 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[laugh]
-Eep!

00:20:38.371 --> 00:20:40.007 position:30% line:83% align:start
The only reason
we're here

00:20:40.041 --> 00:20:42.110 position:13% line:89% align:start
is to defeat Team Nankatsu.

00:20:42.143 --> 00:20:44.045 position:33% line:83% align:start
Everyone else
doesn't matter.

00:20:44.078 --> 00:20:45.747 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ah!
-How cocky of you.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:46.781 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm truly sorry,

00:20:46.814 --> 00:20:49.316 position:19% line:83% align:start
but your winning streak
will be over against us.

00:20:49.349 --> 00:20:52.352 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your legend will vanish
in the semifinals.

00:20:52.385 --> 00:20:53.855 position:16% line:89% align:start
When you play against us,

00:20:53.888 --> 00:20:55.723 position:13% line:83% align:start
we'll pummel you senseless
on the pitch.

00:20:55.757 --> 00:20:56.657 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:20:56.691 --> 00:20:57.859 position:24% line:83% align:start
-What did you say?!
-What did you say?!

00:20:57.892 --> 00:20:59.927 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa] Well, we'll have
to see about that.

00:20:59.961 --> 00:21:01.129 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:21:01.162 --> 00:21:02.063 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa]
[chuckle]

00:21:02.096 --> 00:21:03.296 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:21:04.431 --> 00:21:06.134 position:44% line:83% align:start
[Ryo]
Tsubasa.

00:21:06.167 --> 00:21:08.301 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh, hey.
Here's your captain,

00:21:08.335 --> 00:21:11.506 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nankatsu's general:
Tsubasa Ozora.

00:21:11.539 --> 00:21:13.273 position:27% line:83% align:start
It'll be an honor
to face someone

00:21:13.306 --> 00:21:14.509 position:27% line:89% align:start
of your caliber.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:19.046 position:19% line:83% align:start
My name's Hiroshi Jito,
captain of Team Hirado.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:19.914 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's a pleasure.

00:21:19.947 --> 00:21:21.348 position:16% line:89% align:start
The pleasure's all mine.

00:21:22.617 --> 00:21:25.019 position:35% line:89% align:start
[groaning]

00:21:26.654 --> 00:21:27.855 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uhh...

00:21:28.923 --> 00:21:31.526 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, I'm hoping for
a good match, Captain.

00:21:31.559 --> 00:21:32.560 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:21:33.027 --> 00:21:33.961 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:21:33.995 --> 00:21:35.362 position:41% line:89% align:start
[smirk]

00:21:36.864 --> 00:21:38.331 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Oh!
-Huh?

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.135 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's Hyuga.

00:21:41.169 --> 00:21:42.637 position:13% line:89% align:start
But why's he on the pitch?

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:43.237 position:30% line:89% align:start
I thought he--

00:21:43.271 --> 00:21:44.471 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hyuga made it.

00:21:45.106 --> 00:21:46.306 position:41% line:89% align:start
[smirk]

00:21:47.041 --> 00:21:48.976 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's Kojiro Hyuga...

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:50.211 position:24% line:89% align:start
I can't believe it.

00:21:50.244 --> 00:21:52.113 position:13% line:83% align:start
-This just got interesting.
-Wow!

00:21:52.146 --> 00:21:53.948 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now their team's
finally complete.

00:21:55.149 --> 00:21:55.983 position:35% line:89% align:start
Keep it up.

00:21:56.017 --> 00:21:57.251 position:38% line:89% align:start
Captain.

00:21:57.285 --> 00:21:58.485 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

[Kojiro] <i>I don't need to</i>
 <i>play in this match.</i>

00:22:03.057 --> 00:22:04.357 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>But that doesn't matter.</i>

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:09.630 position:16% line:83% align:start

[Kojiro]
