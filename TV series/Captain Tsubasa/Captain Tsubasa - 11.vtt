Remember,
the first thing to do

00:02:01.355 --> 00:02:03.858 position:13% line:83% align:start
is study the opposing team

to simply play at
the National Tournament.

00:15:08.743 --> 00:15:10.978 position:16% line:89% align:start
Our objective is to win.

00:15:11.011 --> 00:15:13.280 position:21% line:83% align:start
If we can't overcome
this obstacle...

00:15:13.313 --> 00:15:15.349 position:24% line:83% align:start
there'll be no way
we can win the tournament,

00:15:15.382 --> 00:15:17.852 position:33% line:83% align:start
so therefore,
the best thing...

00:15:17.886 --> 00:15:19.554 position:35% line:83% align:start
is to lose
this game already

00:15:19.587 --> 00:15:21.321 position:13% line:89% align:start
and avoid the humiliation!

00:15:21.355 --> 00:15:22.089 position:24% line:89% align:start

It's difficult to know.

00:15:32.933 --> 00:15:35.402 position:24% line:83% align:start
The whole team must
solve the problem.

00:15:35.436 --> 00:15:36.704 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:15:36.738 --> 00:15:37.906 position:30% line:83% align:start
They're passing
the ball around

00:15:37.938 --> 00:15:40.575 position:30% line:83% align:start
trying to break
Shimada's defense, but...

00:15:40.608 --> 00:15:42.009 position:10% line:89% align:start
the rain is inhibiting them.

00:15:42.042 --> 00:15:43.110 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's the first time

00:15:43.143 --> 00:15:45.279 position:27% line:83% align:start
they've played in
these conditions.

00:15:45.312 --> 00:15:45.479 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ughhh!

00:15:46.413 --> 00:15:48.115 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Roberto] Overall,
Nankatsu has better

00:15:48.148 --> 00:15:50.184 position:19% line:83% align:start
possession of the ball,
but due to the rain,

00:15:50.217 --> 00:15:52.319 position:21% line:83% align:start
their speed, balance
and precision

00:15:52.352 --> 00:15:53.822 position:10% line:89% align:start
has decreased significantly.

00:15:53.855 --> 00:15:55.723 position:24% line:83% align:start
They're now playing
at the same level

00:15:55.757 --> 00:15:57.024 position:24% line:89% align:start
as their opponents.

00:15:57.057 --> 00:16:00.060 position:16% line:83% align:start
All of this gives Shimada
an advantage in the match,

00:16:00.093 --> 00:16:01.161 position:21% line:83% align:start
-and it's a problem.
-Oh...

00:16:02.296 --> 00:16:04.732 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Roberto] Worst part is they
stay marked on Tsubasa

00:16:04.766 --> 00:16:05.867 position:16% line:89% align:start
