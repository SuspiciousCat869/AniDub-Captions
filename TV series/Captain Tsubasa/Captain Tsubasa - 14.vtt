 <i>Coach of team Meiwa.</i>

00:02:02.657 --> 00:02:04.626 position:27% line:83% align:start
He always prefers
to stay and drink.

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.327 position:24% line:83% align:start
A coach should not
behave like that.

00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:08.328 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yes...

00:02:08.362 --> 00:02:09.597 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Motoharu]
But even so, Coach Kira

00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:11.633 position:16% line:83% align:start
trained Hyuga and Sawada
from the start.

00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:13.701 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's made us
a very strong team.

00:02:13.735 --> 00:02:14.468 position:19% line:89% align:start
He's a very good coach.

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:18.673 position:13% line:83% align:start
Kojiro, your only objective
is to win.

00:02:18.706 --> 00:02:22.577 position:10% line:83% align:start
The end justifies the means.
Don't forget that.

I've never seen it
like this.

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:33.087 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Kaori] That means that
today's game

00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:34.822 position:10% line:89% align:start
has drawn lots of attention.

I bet that it will be...

00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:37.759 position:27% line:89% align:start
very interesting.

00:02:37.792 --> 00:02:40.494 position:21% line:83% align:start

the most outstanding player.

00:16:09.236 --> 00:16:11.539 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Kaori]
Aggression and passion.

00:16:11.573 --> 00:16:13.106 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Nothing.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.209 position:19% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa's style of play
is based on passion,

00:16:15.242 --> 00:16:17.044 position:27% line:83% align:start
and Hyuga's style
is based on aggression.

00:16:17.077 --> 00:16:19.246 position:24% line:83% align:start
-They're opposites.
-Ah, I see now.

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:21.749 position:19% line:89% align:start
But it's not just this.

00:16:21.783 --> 00:16:24.218 position:13% line:83% align:start
[assistant] Tsubasa enjoys
each movement on the field,

00:16:24.251 --> 00:16:26.053 position:27% line:83% align:start
with a big smile
on his face.

00:16:26.086 --> 00:16:29.423 position:13% line:83% align:start
And he moves as if the ball
were a part of him.

00:16:29.456 --> 00:16:30.290 position:24% line:89% align:start
On the other hand,

00:16:30.324 --> 00:16:32.392 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hyuga plays with
great determination...

00:16:32.426 --> 00:16:34.294 position:19% line:83% align:start
and channels his spirit
in each shot

00:16:34.328 --> 00:16:36.163 position:30% line:83% align:start
and turns into
a dominant player.

00:16:36.196 --> 00:16:37.097 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Kaori]
Exactly.

00:16:38.031 --> 00:16:40.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
And plus, the coaches
from both teams

00:16:40.133 --> 00:16:41.736 position:16% line:89% align:start
are also very different.

00:16:41.769 --> 00:16:43.170 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yes, I know.

00:16:43.203 --> 00:16:45.907 position:16% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa received training
from Roberto Hongo.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.241 position:30% line:83% align:start
And Kozo Kira,
on the other hand,

00:16:47.274 --> 00:16:48.275 position:35% line:83% align:start
is the one
who trained Hyuga.

00:16:49.409 --> 00:16:51.846 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Kaori] Although there was
no professional league...

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.113 position:16% line:89% align:start
a foreign football scout

00:16:53.146 --> 00:16:55.182 position:33% line:83% align:start
offered Kira
a spot on his team,

00:16:55.215 --> 00:16:56.383 position:24% line:89% align:start
but he rejected it,

00:16:56.416 --> 00:16:59.253 position:21% line:83% align:start
and nothing was known
about him for some time.

00:16:59.286 --> 00:17:01.188 position:27% line:83% align:start
Both disappeared,
then came back as coaches.

00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:02.456 position:35% line:83% align:start
[assistant]
Yes.

00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:06.293 position:13% line:83% align:start
Anyway, we really only need
to pick one player.

00:17:06.326 --> 00:17:07.662 position:16% line:83% align:start
The result of this match
will tell us

00:17:07.695 --> 00:17:11.398 position:24% line:83% align:start

is the outstanding player.
