00:14:26.735 --> 00:14:28.035 position:38% line:83% align:start
"Oh, Jun,
you're so handsome

00:14:28.068 --> 00:14:28.969 position:27% line:83% align:start
-"and mysterious.
-Huh?

00:14:29.002 --> 00:14:30.037 position:33% line:89% align:start
"I love you!"

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.039 position:24% line:83% align:start
He gets harassed by
his lunatic fans.

00:14:32.072 --> 00:14:34.241 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you ask me, I think he's
way too overrated.

00:14:34.274 --> 00:14:37.044 position:19% line:83% align:start
Either way, it's a very
important match for them.

00:14:37.077 --> 00:14:39.681 position:16% line:83% align:start
And now, due to the high
stake of the match...

00:14:39.714 --> 00:14:41.683 position:27% line:83% align:start
the most probable
outcome will be

00:14:41.716 --> 00:14:43.718 position:24% line:83% align:start
for him to play in
today's match.

00:14:43.752 --> 00:14:45.085 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't care
if he's there or not.

00:14:45.119 --> 00:14:47.354 position:24% line:83% align:start
It doesn't matter.
We're gonna defeat them.

00:14:47.388 --> 00:14:50.357 position:35% line:83% align:start
We have to.
Let's do it for Genzo!

00:14:50.391 --> 00:14:51.425 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

00:14:51.458 --> 00:14:53.026 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Oh my God, there he is!
-He's so handsome!

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.195 position:16% line:83% align:start
Good morning. Your match
is about to start.

00:14:55.229 --> 00:14:57.498 position:35% line:83% align:start
Mr. Misugi,
do you have any comments?

00:14:57.532 --> 00:14:59.032 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm very excited to play.

00:14:59.066 --> 00:15:00.134 position:19% line:89% align:start
If you win this match,

00:15:00.167 --> 00:15:01.636 position:24% line:83% align:start
your next opponent
in the tournament

00:15:01.669 --> 00:15:03.003 position:19% line:89% align:start
will be Team Nankatsu.

00:15:03.036 --> 00:15:05.540 position:13% line:83% align:start
-What's your take on that?
-They're a very strong team.

00:15:05.573 --> 00:15:07.675 position:13% line:89% align:start
Especially their number 10.

00:15:07.709 --> 00:15:09.042 position:35% line:83% align:start
Personally,
I want the chance to go

00:15:09.076 --> 00:15:10.210 position:19% line:89% align:start
head to head with him.

00:15:10.244 --> 00:15:11.044 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:11.078 --> 00:15:12.012 position:33% line:83% align:start
[reporter 2]
And, we'll be able to

00:15:12.045 --> 00:15:13.213 position:33% line:83% align:start
see you play
during this match?

00:15:13.247 --> 00:15:15.048 position:21% line:83% align:start
Girls, it looks like
our Misugi

00:15:15.082 --> 00:15:17.050 position:19% line:83% align:start
will only play against
Nankatsu.

00:15:17.084 --> 00:15:18.218 position:30% line:83% align:start
But if his team
has a tough time,

00:15:18.252 --> 00:15:19.687 position:13% line:89% align:start
he'll have to play, right?

00:15:19.721 --> 00:15:21.756 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's hope Team Hitachi
gives them a hard time,

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.157 position:19% line:83% align:start
so we can see him play,
right?

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:24.258 position:10% line:83% align:start
-You got this, you got this!

-Ugh!

00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:31.231 position:30% line:83% align:start
That Jun Misugi
is a conceited snob.

00:15:31.265 --> 00:15:33.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
He always has all of
the girls' attention.

00:15:33.333 --> 00:15:35.969 position:24% line:83% align:start
Let's show him who
the better team is.

00:15:36.003 --> 00:15:37.605 position:24% line:83% align:start
What'd you want to
talk about, Misugi?

00:15:37.639 --> 00:15:39.106 position:35% line:83% align:start
-You okay?
-Coach, listen...

00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:40.374 position:24% line:89% align:start
Please understand,

00:15:40.407 --> 00:15:43.043 position:30% line:83% align:start
this tournament
is important to me.

00:15:43.076 --> 00:15:45.245 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm begging you
to let me play.

00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:46.213 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:15:46.246 --> 00:15:48.182 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm fully aware that
at this rate,

00:15:48.215 --> 00:15:50.284 position:24% line:83% align:start
I might not get to
play anymore.

00:15:50.317 --> 00:15:52.019 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're willing to
give up everything

00:15:52.052 --> 00:15:53.721 position:16% line:83% align:start
to play that kid Tsubasa,
huh?

00:15:53.755 --> 00:15:54.889 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:15:54.923 --> 00:15:57.324 position:19% line:83% align:start
Believe me, I get what
you're feeling, Jun.

00:15:57.357 --> 00:16:00.461 position:10% line:83% align:start
But I can't risk your health
because of a whim.

00:16:00.494 --> 00:16:03.030 position:16% line:83% align:start
You'll stay on the bench
for today, son.

00:16:03.063 --> 00:16:05.065 position:10% line:83% align:start
-We'll talk after the match.
-Hm...

00:16:05.098 --> 00:16:06.433 position:21% line:89% align:start
I understand, Coach.

00:16:10.672 --> 00:16:12.206 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh?
That's our manager.

00:16:14.074 --> 00:16:16.678 position:30% line:83% align:start
Woah, just look
how many people there are.

00:16:16.711 --> 00:16:17.946 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's impressive.

00:16:17.978 --> 00:16:20.515 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yes, and that's because
the famous Team Musashi

00:16:20.548 --> 00:16:21.850 position:27% line:89% align:start
will be playing.

00:16:21.883 --> 00:16:23.050 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.221 position:13% line:83% align:start

please?

00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:30.057 position:41% line:83% align:start

Aww!

00:16:31.058 --> 00:16:33.494 position:21% line:83% align:start

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.033 position:21% line:89% align:start
and that girl again?

00:16:40.067 --> 00:16:42.069 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why are they both here
all alone?

 <i>with him. I'm livid!</i>

00:16:49.042 --> 00:16:50.310 position:13% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa, I'm asking you...

00:16:50.344 --> 00:16:52.412 position:24% line:83% align:start
Please, can you let
our captain win?

00:16:52.446 --> 00:16:54.883 position:16% line:83% align:start
He suffers from a serious
heart condition.

00:16:54.916 --> 00:16:56.551 position:21% line:83% align:start
He won't play soccer
ever again.

00:16:56.584 --> 00:16:57.585 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:57.619 --> 00:16:58.620 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:16:58.653 --> 00:17:00.220 position:19% line:89% align:start
He won't play soccer...

00:17:00.254 --> 00:17:00.755 position:41% line:89% align:start
again?

00:17:01.689 --> 00:17:03.090 position:27% line:83% align:start
The captain says
he wants to

00:17:03.123 --> 00:17:04.391 position:19% line:89% align:start
win the finals, but...

00:17:04.424 --> 00:17:07.662 position:21% line:83% align:start
the doctor said that
any injury could be fatal.

00:17:07.695 --> 00:17:10.163 position:16% line:83% align:start
So that's why he doesn't
play a whole match?

00:17:10.197 --> 00:17:11.966 position:33% line:83% align:start
The only ones
who know are...

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.400 position:16% line:89% align:start
the team's coach and me.

00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:15.369 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:17:15.402 --> 00:17:17.237 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm begging you.
This is the last tournament

00:17:17.271 --> 00:17:19.674 position:21% line:83% align:start
in which the captain
will be able to participate.

00:17:19.707 --> 00:17:20.742 position:27% line:89% align:start
Please, Tsubasa,

00:17:20.775 --> 00:17:23.678 position:19% line:83% align:start
at least let him retire
winning the tournament.

00:17:23.711 --> 00:17:25.045 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, but I can't.

00:17:25.078 --> 00:17:26.280 position:19% line:89% align:start
Please do it, Tsubasa.

00:17:27.481 --> 00:17:30.852 position:19% line:83% align:start
My dream is also to win
the national tournament.

00:17:30.885 --> 00:17:33.721 position:13% line:83% align:start
If I do that, I'll be able
to go to Brazil with Roberto

00:17:33.755 --> 00:17:35.055 position:21% line:89% align:start
to be a professional.

Exactly.

00:17:38.826 --> 00:17:40.962 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's the country of soccer.

00:17:40.995 --> 00:17:42.530 position:38% line:83% align:start
If I go,
I'll be able to become

but I won't lose to him.

I won't quit my dream
for anyone.

00:17:48.335 --> 00:17:50.170 position:19% line:89% align:start
Look, I'm sure he also

00:17:50.203 --> 00:17:52.205 position:16% line:83% align:start
wants things to be fair,
okay?

00:17:52.239 --> 00:17:53.908 position:21% line:89% align:start

Tell me something...

00:20:41.341 --> 00:20:43.144 position:19% line:83% align:start
You talked with Tsubasa
before the match,

00:20:43.177 --> 00:20:44.045 position:35% line:89% align:start
didn't you?

00:20:44.078 --> 00:20:45.646 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uh... Yeah.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.714 position:24% line:89% align:start
I hope that you...

00:20:46.748 --> 00:20:48.482 position:30% line:83% align:start
didn't tell him
about my condition.

00:20:48.516 --> 00:20:49.884 position:10% line:89% align:start
I wouldn't want him to know.

00:20:49.917 --> 00:20:51.119 position:27% line:89% align:start
No, how could I?

00:20:51.152 --> 00:20:52.385 position:35% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa was
talking to me about

00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:54.387 position:16% line:89% align:start
something else entirely.

00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:56.591 position:16% line:83% align:start
He told me that if he was
to win the tournament,

00:20:56.624 --> 00:20:58.826 position:27% line:83% align:start
he'd go to Brazil
with his coach.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.161 position:16% line:89% align:start
He wants to go to Brazil?

00:21:00.194 --> 00:21:01.495 position:44% line:83% align:start
Mhm.
He told me...

00:21:01.529 --> 00:21:03.131 position:30% line:83% align:start
that he wanted
to go to Brazil

00:21:03.164 --> 00:21:05.099 position:16% line:83% align:start
to become a professional
soccer player.

00:21:05.133 --> 00:21:06.834 position:30% line:89% align:start
That is great.

00:21:06.868 --> 00:21:11.172 position:13% line:83% align:start

Tsubasa could make happen.

[Jun]
Since he was very young,

00:21:13.207 --> 00:21:15.442 position:16% line:83% align:start
he's never taken his eyes
off the ball.

00:21:15.475 --> 00:21:17.444 position:19% line:83% align:start
His talent and charisma
on the field

00:21:17.477 --> 00:21:19.412 position:19% line:83% align:start
make him a true prodigy
of the game.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.315 position:21% line:83% align:start
And most importantly,
Tsubasa...

00:21:22.349 --> 00:21:24.152 position:19% line:89% align:start
seriously loves soccer.

00:21:24.185 --> 00:21:25.418 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm pretty sure that...

00:21:25.452 --> 00:21:27.088 position:19% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa will represent
our nation

00:21:27.121 --> 00:21:29.624 position:21% line:83% align:start

we can win this.

in the finals...

00:21:54.615 --> 00:21:56.551 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll feel very satisfied.

00:21:56.584 --> 00:21:57.919 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh...

00:21:57.952 --> 00:22:00.788 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll put my heart and soul
into the match.

00:22:00.822 --> 00:22:02.190 position:24% line:89% align:start
Even if it means...

00:22:02.223 --> 00:22:03.691 position:21% line:89% align:start
never playing again.

00:22:07.128 --> 00:22:08.328 position:21% line:89% align:start
Nankatsu or Musashi.

00:22:09.297 --> 00:22:11.232 position:21% line:83% align:start
Either one of the two
would be a problem

00:22:11.265 --> 00:22:12.365 position:24% line:89% align:start
in the final match.

00:22:13.366 --> 00:22:17.138 position:33% line:83% align:start
