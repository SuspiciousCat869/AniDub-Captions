Hey, do you know what
happened to Sanae?

I don't have a clue.

What's she doing at
an important time like this?

00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:11.491 position:24% line:83% align:start
Forget about that,

00:03:11.526 --> 00:03:12.359 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yes, sir!

Let's go to
their game later.

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:17.165 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah. I heard this year's
Nankatsu basketball club

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.398 position:27% line:89% align:start
is in good form.

-Huh?
-Huh?

00:03:21.636 --> 00:03:23.538 position:41% line:83% align:start
[kid 4]
Oh, the soccer club.

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:25.873 position:38% line:83% align:start
Finally!
We got here!

00:03:25.907 --> 00:03:28.543 position:16% line:83% align:start
Where have you guys been?
You're so irresponsible.

00:03:28.576 --> 00:03:30.111 position:35% line:83% align:start
You missed
the opening ceremony.

00:03:30.144 --> 00:03:31.311 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:32.412 position:19% line:89% align:start
We were having practice

00:03:32.446 --> 00:03:33.447 position:30% line:83% align:start
right up until
the last minute.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.717 position:13% line:89% align:start
We went over our strategy.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.484 position:30% line:89% align:start
Right, Tsubasa?

00:03:37.518 --> 00:03:38.452 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

 <i>a real match.</i>

00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:49.296 position:16% line:83% align:start
Man, this year's schedule
has soccer

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:50.397 position:24% line:89% align:start
as the last event.

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:53.534 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Ryo] We have to wait a lot
until then.

00:03:53.568 --> 00:03:55.536 position:24% line:83% align:start
Everyone, how about
we go check out

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.972 position:16% line:83% align:start
the other clubs' matches
in the meantime.

00:03:58.005 --> 00:03:59.006 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Sure!
-Sure!

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.440 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, there's no way
we can win

00:04:00.474 --> 00:04:02.309 position:13% line:83% align:start
the inter-school tournament
this year.

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:03.243 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I dare you to say that

-[kid 3] No, we're not!

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:14.622 position:19% line:89% align:start
Make yourself at home.

00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:16.356 position:21% line:83% align:start
This will be our fort
for now.

00:04:18.092 --> 00:04:19.326 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow.

00:04:21.996 --> 00:04:25.032 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, look, Dad, the scenery
is nice from here.

00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:26.801 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:04:30.171 --> 00:04:31.139 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:04:31.172 --> 00:04:32.807 position:19% line:89% align:start
Taro, let's get going.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.841 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.613 position:27% line:89% align:start
Okay, I'm ready.

00:04:49.257 --> 00:04:50.825 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Mrs. Ozora]
Roberto?

00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:51.826 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:53.528 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Roberto]
Mrs. Ozora!

00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:56.197 position:19% line:83% align:start
What're you doing here
so early?

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.430 position:30% line:83% align:start
The soccer team
plays later.

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:59.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's a lot of time
until the match starts.

00:04:59.667 --> 00:05:03.171 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're right. I just like
daydreaming here.

00:05:03.204 --> 00:05:04.906 position:30% line:83% align:start
If I'm looking
at the empty field,

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:06.641 position:13% line:89% align:start
maybe I will see something.

00:05:06.674 --> 00:05:08.408 position:21% line:83% align:start
Maybe I'll see one of
the infinite amounts

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:09.476 position:24% line:89% align:start
of Tsubasa's plays.

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:12.547 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm really looking forward
to this game.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.149 position:24% line:83% align:start
Practicing with him
and the team

00:05:15.183 --> 00:05:17.952 position:21% line:83% align:start
these past few weeks
surprised me.

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:19.587 position:13% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa is just like me...

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.354 position:24% line:83% align:start
but in a different
day and age.

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:24.491 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Roberto] I think,
"move like this, aim there,"

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:26.561 position:16% line:89% align:start
and Tsubasa just does it.

00:05:26.594 --> 00:05:29.329 position:30% line:83% align:start
He moves as if
he could read my mind.

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:30.798 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm pretty sure
I'm going to feel like

00:05:30.832 --> 00:05:32.099 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm playing out there...

00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:33.668 position:19% line:89% align:start
That gives me shivers.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.238 position:27% line:89% align:start
When I see him...

00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:39.439 position:27% line:83% align:start
I say to myself,
"he'll go far."

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:40.842 position:30% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa will be
a better player

00:05:40.875 --> 00:05:42.009 position:19% line:89% align:start
than I ever got to be.

00:05:44.712 --> 00:05:45.713 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.480 position:24% line:89% align:start
Make him the best.

00:05:47.515 --> 00:05:49.317 position:30% line:83% align:start
He wants to be
the best soccer player

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.318 position:33% line:89% align:start
in the world.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.319 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:53.020 position:27% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa is always
talking about it,

00:05:53.054 --> 00:05:55.756 position:19% line:83% align:start
he wants to be the best
soccer player to ever live.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.191 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's his dream.

00:05:57.225 --> 00:05:58.860 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's an ambitious dream
he's got.

00:05:59.894 --> 00:06:03.363 position:16% line:83% align:start
But that makes it a dream
worth fighting for.

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:04.599 position:38% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:06:07.935 --> 00:06:10.403 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Roberto] Let's make
that dream come true.

00:06:10.437 --> 00:06:14.008 position:33% line:83% align:start
I know we can
do it together, Tsubasa.

00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:14.675 position:38% line:89% align:start

[Tsubasa]
Huh, the 6th row is empty.

00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:23.584 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, our runner got injured

00:06:23.618 --> 00:06:25.286 position:24% line:83% align:start
and had to withdraw
from the race.

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:26.587 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:06:26.621 --> 00:06:30.457 position:10% line:83% align:start
That being said, this year's
line-up is really bad.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.926 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Take a look.

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:33.460 position:13% line:89% align:start

What was that?

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.167 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're so bad,

losing every match.

00:12:08.597 --> 00:12:09.964 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's so many people
watching.

00:12:09.997 --> 00:12:12.800 position:13% line:83% align:start
Uh... My legs are starting
to shake, you guys.

00:12:12.833 --> 00:12:15.035 position:13% line:83% align:start
Wait a second. I'm actually
going to play a match

00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:17.938 position:35% line:83% align:start
in front of
all these people?

00:12:17.972 --> 00:12:19.473 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Roberto] Isn't this
exciting, you guys?

00:12:19.507 --> 00:12:20.508 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:20.542 --> 00:12:21.676 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa]
Roberto!

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.010 position:27% line:83% align:start
What's wrong with
you guys?

00:12:23.043 --> 00:12:24.546 position:30% line:83% align:start
The more people
come to watch,

00:12:24.579 --> 00:12:26.180 position:16% line:83% align:start
the more exciting a game
it'll be.

00:12:26.213 --> 00:12:28.282 position:24% line:89% align:start
But... But, sir...

00:12:28.315 --> 00:12:29.483 position:27% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa, one day,

00:12:29.517 --> 00:12:30.619 position:30% line:83% align:start
when you reach
the world stage,

00:12:30.652 --> 00:12:33.387 position:24% line:83% align:start
the atmosphere here
won't even compare.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.623 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:12:34.656 --> 00:12:36.924 position:35% line:89% align:start
[cheering]

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.094 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:41.095 --> 00:12:43.831 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Ryo] They look like
they're used to it, huh?

00:12:43.864 --> 00:12:45.266 position:35% line:83% align:start
Meanwhile,
our team looks like

00:12:45.299 --> 00:12:47.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
a bunch of scaredy cats.

00:12:47.268 --> 00:12:48.536 position:21% line:89% align:start
Genzo's not here yet.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:49.537 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:13:03.384 --> 00:13:04.985 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's a no for me, Coach.

00:13:05.019 --> 00:13:06.854 position:33% line:83% align:start
We can't find
our captain anywhere.

00:13:06.887 --> 00:13:08.455 position:35% line:89% align:start
Is that so?

00:13:08.489 --> 00:13:09.724 position:30% line:89% align:start
We will adjust.

00:13:09.758 --> 00:13:11.292 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll play without
Genzo today.

00:13:11.325 --> 00:13:13.494 position:13% line:83% align:start
Thankfully, Nankatsu isn't
a strong team,

00:13:13.528 --> 00:13:14.395 position:30% line:89% align:start
so don't worry.

00:13:14.428 --> 00:13:15.996 position:13% line:89% align:start
So do your best out there.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.163 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:13:17.331 --> 00:13:19.266 position:24% line:83% align:start

[cheering]

00:13:28.409 --> 00:13:30.811 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why do I have to go
all the way to Shutetsu

00:13:30.844 --> 00:13:33.981 position:19% line:83% align:start
to have myself enrolled
in Nankatsu, I wonder?

00:13:34.014 --> 00:13:35.282 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Taro]
Uh... All right!

00:13:35.316 --> 00:13:37.519 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll kick the ball through
the wall and the pole

00:13:37.552 --> 00:13:39.153 position:24% line:83% align:start
and make it bounce
back to me!

00:13:39.186 --> 00:13:40.254 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:13:41.589 --> 00:13:42.590 position:35% line:89% align:start
Watch out!

00:13:43.658 --> 00:13:44.858 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:46.894 position:24% line:89% align:start
You got lucky kid,

00:13:46.927 --> 00:13:49.531 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can catch anything
without even having to look.

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:53.768 position:16% line:83% align:start
[kid 3] Are you serious?
Genzo hasn't shown up yet?

00:13:53.802 --> 00:13:55.903 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yes, this might be
our chance.

00:13:55.936 --> 00:13:57.806 position:16% line:83% align:start
If the genius goalkeeper
isn't here,

00:13:57.838 --> 00:13:59.440 position:27% line:83% align:start
there is a chance
we can actually win.

00:13:59.473 --> 00:14:00.542 position:21% line:89% align:start
Even if he was here,

00:14:00.575 --> 00:14:02.677 position:21% line:83% align:start
our soccer club would
give them a very close game.

00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:04.011 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I've seen them.

00:14:04.044 --> 00:14:05.846 position:33% line:83% align:start
They've been
practicing nonstop.

00:14:05.879 --> 00:14:08.248 position:21% line:83% align:start
They've really turned
things around this year.

00:14:08.282 --> 00:14:09.617 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:14:09.651 --> 00:14:10.785 position:30% line:89% align:start
You heard that?

00:14:10.819 --> 00:14:12.419 position:21% line:83% align:start
What were you saying
about Genzo

00:14:12.453 --> 00:14:14.421 position:16% line:89% align:start
getting humiliated again?

00:14:14.455 --> 00:14:15.690 position:41% line:89% align:start
[growl]

00:14:15.724 --> 00:14:18.058 position:10% line:89% align:start
 <i>This isn't what I expected.</i>

00:14:21.596 --> 00:14:22.564 position:16% line:89% align:start
I wonder what happened...

00:14:22.597 --> 00:14:23.864 position:30% line:89% align:start
Is Genzo okay?

00:14:23.897 --> 00:14:27.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
Maybe he was so afraid
of you that he ran away.

00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:30.204 position:30% line:83% align:start
Your jokes are
as lame as ever, Ryo!

00:14:30.237 --> 00:14:31.673 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's you, Genzo!

00:14:31.706 --> 00:14:32.906 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.177 position:35% line:83% align:start
Hey, Coach,
our captain is here!

00:14:37.211 --> 00:14:38.212 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:14:40.948 --> 00:14:43.350 position:16% line:89% align:start
What... What's with you?

00:14:43.384 --> 00:14:44.218 position:27% line:89% align:start
Listen, Tsubasa.

00:14:44.251 --> 00:14:46.053 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's just like
I said before.

00:14:46.086 --> 00:14:48.055 position:19% line:83% align:start
This match will also be
a personal challenge

00:14:48.088 --> 00:14:49.223 position:35% line:83% align:start
to find out
once and for all,

00:14:49.256 --> 00:14:50.859 position:19% line:83% align:start
if you really can score
on me!

00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:51.860 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:14:51.892 --> 00:14:53.862 position:24% line:83% align:start
I won't just score
one goal on you.

00:14:53.894 --> 00:14:55.630 position:21% line:83% align:start
Nankatsu will defeat
Shutetsu,

00:14:55.663 --> 00:14:57.131 position:24% line:89% align:start
whatever it takes.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.305 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh! [grunt]

00:15:09.443 --> 00:15:10.645 position:41% line:89% align:start
[growl]

00:15:11.646 --> 00:15:13.515 position:41% line:89% align:start
[growl]

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:17.184 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah...

00:15:17.217 --> 00:15:19.052 position:41% line:83% align:start
I guess
Nankatsu Elementary's

00:15:19.086 --> 00:15:20.622 position:21% line:89% align:start
principal is here...

00:15:20.655 --> 00:15:22.624 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]
Oh, you're dribbling!

00:15:22.657 --> 00:15:24.626 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're dribbling
like Tsubasa!

00:15:24.659 --> 00:15:26.528 position:33% line:89% align:start
Huh? Tsubasa?

00:15:26.561 --> 00:15:27.327 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yes, Tsubasa.

00:15:28.061 --> 00:15:29.263 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you're really
into soccer,

00:15:29.296 --> 00:15:32.399 position:21% line:83% align:start
you have to check out
our star player, Tsubasa.

00:15:32.433 --> 00:15:33.434 position:33% line:89% align:start
He's awesome.

00:15:33.467 --> 00:15:34.803 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Come with me!

00:15:34.836 --> 00:15:36.470 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm going to be
cheering him on.

00:15:36.504 --> 00:15:39.339 position:33% line:83% align:start
Oh! Wait up.
I need Nankatsu's principal.

00:15:39.373 --> 00:15:41.008 position:33% line:83% align:start
Come with me.
I'm the leader of

00:15:41.041 --> 00:15:43.277 position:19% line:83% align:start
the Nankatsu Elementary
cheering squad.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.078 position:21% line:83% align:start

-Shutetsu!
-Shutetsu!

00:15:46.213 --> 00:15:47.381 position:30% line:83% align:start
-I guess Sanae
-Fight on!

00:15:47.414 --> 00:15:49.851 position:16% line:83% align:start
-is not going to show up.
-Fight on! Shutetsu!

00:15:49.884 --> 00:15:51.619 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]
Phew, I made it on time.

00:15:51.653 --> 00:15:52.787 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:53.788 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[Koji] Sanae?!
-[Kazushige] Sanae?!

00:15:53.822 --> 00:15:55.189 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Who's he?
-Who's he?

00:15:55.222 --> 00:15:57.926 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, look over there.
That's Tsubasa.

00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.293 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah...

00:16:03.531 --> 00:16:04.998 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh! It's that kid.

00:16:05.032 --> 00:16:06.400 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Koji]
Hey, you there.

00:16:06.433 --> 00:16:07.401 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh?

00:16:08.101 --> 00:16:09.704 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why are you with Sanae?

00:16:09.737 --> 00:16:12.206 position:21% line:83% align:start
Uh... I just met her
at the entrance.

00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:13.608 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm actually transferring

00:16:13.641 --> 00:16:15.543 position:19% line:83% align:start
to Nankatsu Elementary
today.

00:16:15.577 --> 00:16:17.244 position:24% line:89% align:start
What? Transferring?

00:16:17.277 --> 00:16:19.747 position:19% line:83% align:start
My name is Taro Misaki.
Nice to meet you.

00:16:20.915 --> 00:16:22.015 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:22.049 --> 00:16:23.952 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]
Hooray! Hooray!

00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:29.223 position:38% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa!

00:16:29.891 --> 00:16:31.291 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Hooray! Hooray!
-Sanae,

00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:33.093 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Tsubasa!
-wait, listen!

00:16:33.126 --> 00:16:34.094 position:27% line:83% align:start
-There she goes!
-[Sanae] Fight on!

00:16:34.127 --> 00:16:35.095 position:21% line:83% align:start
-That's cool! It has

00:16:35.128 --> 00:16:36.430 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Tsubasa's name on it!
-Tsubasa!

00:16:36.463 --> 00:16:39.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
Being so popular must be
really hard, huh, Tsubasa?

00:16:39.801 --> 00:16:41.068 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Tsubasa!

00:16:41.101 --> 00:16:42.336 position:33% line:89% align:start
Do your best!

00:16:42.369 --> 00:16:45.540 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ooh!
-[Ryo] [chuckle] I bet!

00:16:45.573 --> 00:16:47.474 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry for being late.

00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:48.776 position:30% line:89% align:start
Are you ready?

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:49.677 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:16:49.711 --> 00:16:51.613 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm counting on you,
Captain.

00:16:51.646 --> 00:16:52.647 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Genzo]
Yes.

00:16:54.649 --> 00:16:55.583 position:24% line:89% align:start
Listen to me, guys!

00:16:55.617 --> 00:16:58.452 position:27% line:83% align:start
Whatever happens,
don't let Tsubasa score.

00:16:58.485 --> 00:17:00.187 position:24% line:83% align:start
We have to stop him
from scoring.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.488 position:10% line:89% align:start
Don't let him near the goal.

00:17:02.256 --> 00:17:03.457 position:30% line:83% align:start
I want you all
to remember...

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.093 position:19% line:83% align:start
that this match is also
a personal challenge

00:17:06.126 --> 00:17:07.127 position:35% line:89% align:start
between us.

-I'm here!

-Yes!

00:17:10.264 --> 00:17:11.365 position:27% line:83% align:start
