00:13:57.404 --> 00:13:59.306 position:24% line:83% align:start
There was someone
who ignored the plan,

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.575 position:30% line:89% align:start
wasn't there?

00:14:00.608 --> 00:14:01.676 position:30% line:89% align:start

when it went better

00:14:09.016 --> 00:14:11.919 position:27% line:83% align:start
than what he had
actually planned...

00:14:11.952 --> 00:14:13.788 position:10% line:89% align:start
just like Tsubasa this time.

00:14:13.822 --> 00:14:14.988 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh...

00:14:15.022 --> 00:14:15.989 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Roberto]
Listen up!

00:14:16.023 --> 00:14:17.659 position:27% line:83% align:start
Soccer is a game
that is played

00:14:17.692 --> 00:14:19.026 position:16% line:89% align:start
based on your judgment.

00:14:19.059 --> 00:14:22.697 position:13% line:83% align:start
You must play believing in
yourselves from now on!

00:14:22.731 --> 00:14:23.732 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Yes, Coach!
-Yes, Coach!

00:14:23.765 --> 00:14:24.766 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's right!

00:14:24.799 --> 00:14:26.266 position:30% line:83% align:start
If you do only
as you're told,

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.837 position:21% line:83% align:start
you'll never improve
your abilities!

00:14:28.869 --> 00:14:29.804 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's right!

00:14:29.838 --> 00:14:30.638 position:27% line:89% align:start
You must remembe

00:14:30.672 --> 00:14:32.906 position:47% line:83% align:start
r
our offensive!

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.876 position:13% line:83% align:start
Use both sides to stretch
their defensive line

00:14:35.909 --> 00:14:37.779 position:19% line:83% align:start
and create an opening
in the middle!

00:14:37.812 --> 00:14:39.079 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:14:39.113 --> 00:14:40.849 position:13% line:83% align:start
[coach] The Nankatsu team
we face today

00:14:40.881 --> 00:14:42.684 position:30% line:83% align:start
is not the one
we usually face!

00:14:42.717 --> 00:14:44.017 position:16% line:89% align:start
But we're still superior

00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:45.919 position:27% line:83% align:start
when it comes to
holding the ball.

00:14:45.953 --> 00:14:47.622 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't let your guard down
on the second half!

00:14:47.655 --> 00:14:48.455 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Understood!

00:14:51.693 --> 00:14:53.494 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm counting on you.

00:14:53.528 --> 00:14:54.629 position:35% line:89% align:start
Just go...

00:14:54.662 --> 00:14:55.896 position:24% line:89% align:start
and score a goal.

00:14:55.929 --> 00:14:57.331 position:5% line:89% align:start
What do you mean, Captain?

00:14:57.364 --> 00:14:58.265 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm not going

00:14:58.298 --> 00:15:02.436 position:35% line:83% align:start
to ask you
to score 50 points anymore.

00:15:02.469 --> 00:15:03.671 position:30% line:89% align:start
But please...

00:15:03.705 --> 00:15:05.005 position:27% line:89% align:start
score one goal.

00:15:06.907 --> 00:15:09.309 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Hanji] [laughs]
How about that?

00:15:09.343 --> 00:15:10.277 position:24% line:89% align:start
Just like I said,

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.080 position:24% line:83% align:start
Shutetsu is having
a hard time, isn't it?

00:15:13.113 --> 00:15:15.416 position:27% line:83% align:start
Depending on how
the second half goes,

00:15:15.449 --> 00:15:17.786 position:19% line:83% align:start
they could really lose
the match today.

00:15:17.819 --> 00:15:19.721 position:33% line:83% align:start

00:15:26.561 --> 00:15:27.896 position:33% line:89% align:start
