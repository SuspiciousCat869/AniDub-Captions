00:10:53.053 --> 00:10:54.054 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:54.589 --> 00:10:56.023 position:38% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:10:56.824 --> 00:10:58.893 position:19% line:83% align:start
You played really well,
Tsubasa.

00:10:58.926 --> 00:11:00.227 position:35% line:83% align:start
Thank you.
So did you.

00:11:01.962 --> 00:11:02.863 position:35% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa...

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.665 position:27% line:89% align:start
Good job, Genzo.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.172 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, it's finally over.

00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:13.508 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ouch my back.

00:11:13.542 --> 00:11:15.409 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've never played
such an intense game

00:11:15.442 --> 00:11:16.477 position:33% line:83% align:start
like this one
my whole life.

00:11:16.511 --> 00:11:17.845 position:30% line:83% align:start
Neither have I.
It all hurts.

00:11:17.878 --> 00:11:21.148 position:13% line:83% align:start
It feels like my lungs are
ripping out of my chest.

00:11:21.182 --> 00:11:23.150 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, great game.

00:11:23.184 --> 00:11:23.851 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:11:23.884 --> 00:11:24.818 position:16% line:89% align:start
I never thought you guys

00:11:24.852 --> 00:11:26.621 position:30% line:83% align:start
could actually
play like that.

00:11:26.655 --> 00:11:29.123 position:30% line:83% align:start
I gotta admit,
you improved a lot.

00:11:29.156 --> 00:11:30.024 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-[cheers]

00:11:30.057 --> 00:11:31.759 position:30% line:83% align:start
You all played
incredibly well!

00:11:31.792 --> 00:11:32.860 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:11:32.893 --> 00:11:34.962 position:21% line:83% align:start
Nankatsu and Shutetsu
are the best!

00:11:34.995 --> 00:11:37.231 position:35% line:83% align:start
You gave us
an amazing match.

00:11:37.264 --> 00:11:38.732 position:16% line:89% align:start
You guys aren't mediocre.

00:11:38.766 --> 00:11:41.603 position:21% line:83% align:start
Everyone in the city
is proud of you!

00:11:41.636 --> 00:11:43.470 position:35% line:89% align:start

[laughs]

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:47.007 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, Tsubasa...

00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:47.741 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.711 position:27% line:83% align:start
You guys gave us
an incredible game.

00:11:50.744 --> 00:11:52.012 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:11:52.046 --> 00:11:56.050 position:35% line:89% align:start
[cheering]

00:11:56.083 --> 00:11:57.151 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:11:57.184 --> 00:11:59.453 position:27% line:83% align:start
Thank you so much
for cheering us on!

00:11:59.486 --> 00:12:00.555 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:12:00.589 --> 00:12:02.189 position:35% line:89% align:start
[cheering]

00:12:02.223 --> 00:12:03.692 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, Tsubasa.

00:12:03.724 --> 00:12:05.726 position:38% line:89% align:start
[sobbing]

00:12:05.759 --> 00:12:08.395 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Hey, don't cry.
-[chuckles]

00:12:08.429 --> 00:12:09.730 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Tsubasa.
-Huh?

00:12:09.763 --> 00:12:11.765 position:10% line:89% align:start
That was an excellent match.

00:12:11.799 --> 00:12:13.000 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you!

Hi, good morning, Roberto.

00:12:50.804 --> 00:12:52.006 position:21% line:89% align:start
Good morning, Ma'am.

00:12:53.474 --> 00:12:55.677 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey, um, where is Tsubasa?

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.011 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, take a wild guess.

00:12:57.044 --> 00:12:58.879 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's outside playing
in the court.

00:12:58.912 --> 00:13:00.080 position:27% line:83% align:start
He just finished
a match

00:13:00.114 --> 00:13:01.683 position:30% line:83% align:start
yet he's still
playing soccer.

00:13:01.716 --> 00:13:03.618 position:10% line:89% align:start
That kid does not get tired.

00:13:03.652 --> 00:13:04.918 position:35% line:89% align:start

00:13:07.656 --> 00:13:08.623 position:35% line:89% align:start

-Take it away from me.
-Oh yeah?

00:13:09.823 --> 00:13:10.824 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'll show you.
[laugh]

00:13:10.858 --> 00:13:13.427 position:13% line:83% align:start
The two of them never stop,
do they?

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.828 position:19% line:89% align:start
And here I am exhausted

00:13:14.862 --> 00:13:16.297 position:30% line:83% align:start
from the match
we recently played.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.866 position:13% line:83% align:start
I feel like we just played
this morning.

00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:21.736 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wonder who's better
between them.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:22.836 position:33% line:89% align:start
I don't know.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.405 position:33% line:83% align:start
They're both
good at dribbling...

00:13:24.438 --> 00:13:27.074 position:24% line:83% align:start
but I think Tsubasa
is better at shooting.

00:13:27.107 --> 00:13:28.909 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I think you're right.

00:13:28.942 --> 00:13:31.378 position:21% line:83% align:start
And...now for Taro's
surprise kick.

00:13:31.412 --> 00:13:32.379 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.616 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

00:13:34.649 --> 00:13:36.183 position:21% line:83% align:start
What were you saying,
Kenichi?

00:13:36.216 --> 00:13:37.451 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:38.620 position:13% line:89% align:start
That doesn't really matter.

00:13:38.653 --> 00:13:39.920 position:13% line:89% align:start
If we have the two of them,

00:13:39.953 --> 00:13:42.489 position:21% line:83% align:start
we'll be able to play
in the national tournament.

00:13:42.524 --> 00:13:44.158 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah, if we beat Shutetsu

00:13:44.191 --> 00:13:45.694 position:33% line:83% align:start
in the single
elimination phase,

00:13:45.727 --> 00:13:47.328 position:35% line:83% align:start
we'll go to
the national tournament.

00:13:47.361 --> 00:13:48.763 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Ryo] I don't think
you'll be able to.

00:13:48.797 --> 00:13:49.997 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:13:50.632 --> 00:13:51.832 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Tsuyoshi]
Hi, Ryo!

00:13:52.366 --> 00:13:52.966 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey there.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.768 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why did you say that, Ryo?

00:13:53.802 --> 00:13:54.902 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Hey, looks like
-Yeah,

00:13:54.935 --> 00:13:55.869 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Ryo came back.
-what's wrong with you?

00:13:55.903 --> 00:13:57.137 position:35% line:83% align:start
Why're you
underestimating us?

00:13:57.171 --> 00:13:58.038 position:35% line:89% align:start
Calm down.

00:13:58.072 --> 00:13:59.473 position:24% line:83% align:start
I meant to say that
we won't all go to

00:13:59.507 --> 00:14:00.941 position:16% line:89% align:start
the national tournament.

00:14:00.974 --> 00:14:03.310 position:21% line:83% align:start
The city of Nankatsu
will make a new soccer team.

00:14:03.344 --> 00:14:06.080 position:13% line:83% align:start
The best local players will
be chosen to play together.

00:14:06.113 --> 00:14:07.481 position:16% line:89% align:start
The best players you say?

00:14:07.515 --> 00:14:08.616 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's all this?

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.250 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey there, Tsubasa.

00:14:10.284 --> 00:14:12.353 position:41% line:83% align:start
Before,
in the elimination phase,

00:14:12.386 --> 00:14:13.120 position:16% line:89% align:start
the matches were between

00:14:13.153 --> 00:14:14.988 position:24% line:83% align:start
all of the schools
of the city.

00:14:15.022 --> 00:14:17.891 position:19% line:83% align:start
But this year, they've
set up a different system.

00:14:17.925 --> 00:14:19.860 position:19% line:83% align:start
All of the best players
from all the schools

00:14:19.893 --> 00:14:22.162 position:24% line:83% align:start
will be in a single
Nankatsu team.

00:14:23.297 --> 00:14:25.265 position:21% line:83% align:start
It was made this way
so we can be up to par

00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:26.634 position:30% line:83% align:start
with the other
districts' teams,

00:14:26.668 --> 00:14:27.935 position:38% line:83% align:start
you know,
the ones taking part

00:14:27.968 --> 00:14:29.537 position:13% line:89% align:start
in the national tournament.

00:14:29.571 --> 00:14:31.205 position:38% line:83% align:start
So then,
there'll be a new team

00:14:31.238 --> 00:14:33.508 position:21% line:83% align:start
that combines all of
Nankatsu's schools?

00:14:33.541 --> 00:14:34.475 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:36.343 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you want to go to
the national tournament,

00:14:36.377 --> 00:14:39.313 position:13% line:83% align:start
you'll have to be chosen to
play for the new city team.

00:14:39.346 --> 00:14:41.649 position:13% line:83% align:start
The tryouts are very soon,
so be ready.

00:14:41.683 --> 00:14:42.416 position:27% line:89% align:start
How soon is that?

00:14:42.449 --> 00:14:43.551 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's great.

00:14:43.585 --> 00:14:46.086 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll try my hardest to go
to the national tournament.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.321 position:21% line:89% align:start
Be realistic, Manabu.

00:14:47.354 --> 00:14:49.423 position:16% line:83% align:start
You couldn't even make it
to the bench of the team.

00:14:49.456 --> 00:14:52.493 position:13% line:83% align:start
Of course I can, you dummy.
We tied with Shutetsu.

00:14:52.527 --> 00:14:54.027 position:19% line:89% align:start
Nothing is impossible.

00:14:54.061 --> 00:14:56.463 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah, all we need to do
is practice some more.

00:14:56.497 --> 00:14:58.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's exactly it.
If we work our hardest,

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
we'll be sure to make
the tryouts.

00:15:00.502 --> 00:15:02.369 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

00:15:02.403 --> 00:15:03.805 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:15:03.838 --> 00:15:05.205 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>Who would've guessed it?</i>

00:15:05.239 --> 00:15:08.342 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>Their last match gave them</i>
 <i>confidence in themselves.</i>

00:15:08.375 --> 00:15:09.276 position:33% line:89% align:start
 <i>And me too.</i>

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.380 position:27% line:83% align:start
Roberto, tell me.
What do you plan to do now?

00:15:13.414 --> 00:15:14.348 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well, to be honest,

00:15:14.381 --> 00:15:16.518 position:13% line:83% align:start
I thought about going back
to Brazil.

00:15:16.551 --> 00:15:17.217 position:33% line:89% align:start
I understand.

00:15:17.985 --> 00:15:19.319 position:30% line:83% align:start
Although I was
hoping that...

00:15:19.353 --> 00:15:20.254 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh no, Captain,

00:15:20.287 --> 00:15:21.756 position:27% line:83% align:start
you don't have to
worry about it.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:24.091 position:33% line:83% align:start
I assure you,
it won't happen again.

00:15:24.124 --> 00:15:25.259 position:13% line:89% align:start
What are you talking about?

00:15:25.292 --> 00:15:27.928 position:41% line:83% align:start
Well...
you'll see, Mrs. Ozora.

00:15:27.961 --> 00:15:31.098 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm talking about how
the Captain and I first met.

00:15:33.835 --> 00:15:35.102 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Roberto]
That day, I was...

00:15:35.135 --> 00:15:36.236 position:24% line:89% align:start
severely depressed.

00:15:37.104 --> 00:15:38.673 position:24% line:83% align:start
I couldn't swallow
the horrible news

00:15:38.706 --> 00:15:40.775 position:13% line:89% align:start
about my eyesight problem.

00:15:40.809 --> 00:15:43.444 position:21% line:83% align:start
So I decided to drown
my sorrows away.

00:15:46.947 --> 00:15:50.685 position:16% line:83% align:start
I went as far as to think
my life had no meaning.

But at that moment...

00:15:53.521 --> 00:15:54.589 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aagh!

00:15:54.622 --> 00:15:57.024 position:19% line:83% align:start
Captain, look, I think
someone jumped in the water.

00:15:57.057 --> 00:15:58.058 position:30% line:89% align:start
What'd you say?

00:15:58.091 --> 00:16:00.093 position:30% line:83% align:start
That can't be.
We have to save him!

00:16:01.228 --> 00:16:03.598 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Roberto]
Captain Ozora saved my life.

00:16:03.631 --> 00:16:06.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
Shortly afterwards,
he recommended I come here

00:16:06.233 --> 00:16:08.670 position:30% line:83% align:start
to see the best
ophthalmologist and well...

00:16:08.703 --> 00:16:11.539 position:10% line:83% align:start
in the end, it didn't really
help my situation.

00:16:11.573 --> 00:16:13.908 position:21% line:83% align:start
I could never imagine
that not being able to play

00:16:13.942 --> 00:16:15.877 position:24% line:83% align:start
could drive someone
to that extreme.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:18.880 position:16% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa lives for soccer
just like I do.

00:16:18.913 --> 00:16:20.314 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Hmm...
-Hmm...

00:16:20.347 --> 00:16:22.784 position:21% line:83% align:start
Your family has been
so good to me, Captain,

00:16:22.817 --> 00:16:25.219 position:30% line:83% align:start
that I feel bad
saying this, but...

00:16:25.252 --> 00:16:28.489 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'd like to ask for
a special favor.

00:16:28.523 --> 00:16:29.524 position:27% line:89% align:start
A special favor?

00:16:36.931 --> 00:16:38.398 position:33% line:89% align:start
Mr. Mikami...

00:16:38.432 --> 00:16:39.299 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm not tired yet.

00:16:39.333 --> 00:16:40.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm sure that Tsubasa
and the rest

00:16:40.502 --> 00:16:42.670 position:19% line:83% align:start
are training right now
at this moment.

recovering

against Nankatsu.

I don't want you
getting hurt.

00:16:47.709 --> 00:16:48.710 position:33% line:89% align:start
I understand.

00:16:49.443 --> 00:16:50.778 position:33% line:89% align:start
Master Genzo.

00:16:51.445 --> 00:16:52.647 position:33% line:89% align:start
Master Genzo.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.882 position:33% line:83% align:start
There's mail
waiting for you.

00:16:53.915 --> 00:16:55.449 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's your magazine.

00:17:00.387 --> 00:17:01.623 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:17:01.656 --> 00:17:02.690 position:19% line:89% align:start
What's wrong, my child?

00:17:02.724 --> 00:17:05.058 position:13% line:83% align:start
Find an interesting article
on the front page?

00:17:05.092 --> 00:17:06.126 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm very sorry.

00:17:06.159 --> 00:17:08.495 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'll be back.
I have to go.

Oh, hi there, Genzo.

00:17:26.748 --> 00:17:28.650 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm guessing you already
know about the new team

00:17:28.683 --> 00:17:29.617 position:19% line:89% align:start
for the national team.

00:17:29.651 --> 00:17:32.219 position:19% line:83% align:start
Maybe we'll be playing
together, you and I.

00:17:32.252 --> 00:17:33.320 position:30% line:83% align:start
The tie breaker
will have to wait.

00:17:33.353 --> 00:17:34.756 position:24% line:83% align:start
That doesn't matter
right now!

00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:36.189 position:13% line:89% align:start
Roberto Hongo, where is he?

00:17:36.223 --> 00:17:38.392 position:30% line:83% align:start
What's got you
so jumpy, huh?

00:17:38.425 --> 00:17:40.360 position:13% line:83% align:start
Roberto didn't come today.
Is something wrong?

00:17:40.394 --> 00:17:43.063 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then that means, you guys
haven't found out, have you?

-Huh?

00:17:49.236 --> 00:17:51.171 position:41% line:83% align:start
[growl]
Roberto Hongo...

00:17:51.204 --> 00:17:53.541 position:21% line:83% align:start
won't play soccer for
the rest of his life.

-But why would he do that?
-But why would he do that?

00:18:02.416 --> 00:18:04.351 position:13% line:89% align:start
Retinal detachment is why.

00:18:04.384 --> 00:18:05.452 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-That doesn't make sense.

He plays with us
all the time.

Don't compare
a professional match

that I'll make your son...

into the best soccer player

-Roberto!
-I'm begging you.

00:18:52.332 --> 00:18:54.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
Allow me to take your son

 <i>Huh?!</i>

Roberto...

00:19:00.642 --> 00:19:01.576 position:24% line:89% align:start
Tell me one thing.

00:19:01.609 --> 00:19:04.679 position:16% line:83% align:start
Is it true you won't ever
play soccer again?

00:19:04.712 --> 00:19:05.613 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's right, kid.

00:19:05.647 --> 00:19:08.650 position:33% line:83% align:start
So that means
your eye problem is real?

00:19:08.683 --> 00:19:09.817 position:41% line:89% align:start
It is.

00:19:09.851 --> 00:19:11.218 position:21% line:89% align:start
And unfortunately...

00:19:11.251 --> 00:19:13.855 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll never be able to
play soccer again.

Oh...

00:19:18.158 --> 00:19:18.458 position:35% line:89% align:start
Roberto...

00:19:19.493 --> 00:19:21.896 position:24% line:83% align:start
Brazil is a country

[gasps]

Tsubasa, but...

00:19:37.111 --> 00:19:38.946 position:33% line:83% align:start
In that case,
we should take advantage

00:19:46.286 --> 00:19:48.188 position:33% line:83% align:start
train harder

00:20:33.101 --> 00:20:34.135 position:16% line:89% align:start
I know we'll find talent

00:20:34.168 --> 00:20:36.637 position:27% line:83% align:start
that's up to par
to Shutetsu.

00:20:36.671 --> 00:20:39.140 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:20:39.173 --> 00:20:40.174 position:38% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa!

00:20:40.208 --> 00:20:41.374 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:20:44.545 --> 00:20:45.713 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:20:45.747 --> 00:20:46.748 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:49.550 position:27% line:83% align:start
He made that shot
in mid-air!

00:20:49.584 --> 00:20:51.853 position:33% line:83% align:start
That kid has
an incredible shot.

00:20:51.886 --> 00:20:53.755 position:13% line:89% align:start
Ugh! It had to be Tsubasa.

00:20:53.788 --> 00:20:54.655 position:24% line:89% align:start
That was excellent.

00:20:54.689 --> 00:20:56.256 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think I just found
our main striker

00:20:56.289 --> 00:20:58.092 position:33% line:83% align:start
for the team.
It's him!

00:20:58.126 --> 00:20:59.259 position:38% line:89% align:start
Roberto!

00:20:59.292 --> 00:21:00.661 position:38% line:83% align:start
We'll win
the national tournament,

00:21:00.695 --> 00:21:03.531 position:19% line:83% align:start
and then we're going to
go to Brazil.

00:21:03.564 --> 00:21:04.565 position:35% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa...

00:21:05.666 --> 00:21:07.034 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hello, everyone.

00:21:07.068 --> 00:21:08.136 position:24% line:89% align:start
I want to thank you

00:21:08.169 --> 00:21:10.238 position:27% line:83% align:start
for participating
in the tryouts.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.140 position:30% line:83% align:start
Our judges were
very impressed

00:21:12.173 --> 00:21:12.940 position:24% line:83% align:start
by your outstanding
performance.

00:21:12.974 --> 00:21:14.041 position:27% line:89% align:start
Shut up already.

00:21:14.075 --> 00:21:16.043 position:16% line:83% align:start
Tell us who was chosen to
be in the new team please!

00:21:16.077 --> 00:21:17.111 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Tell us already!
-Tell us already!

00:21:17.145 --> 00:21:20.347 position:35% line:83% align:start
Oh I will.
You don't have to be mean.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.116 position:27% line:83% align:start
[narrator] <i>And so</i>
 <i>the results were in.</i>

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:23.450 position:30% line:89% align:start
 <i>From Shutetsu,</i>

00:21:23.483 --> 00:21:27.155 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>you've got Genzo, Teppei,</i>

 <i>you've got Tsubasa, Taro,</i>

00:21:34.294 --> 00:21:36.664 position:38% line:83% align:start

 <i>Ryo is there too.</i>

00:21:36.697 --> 00:21:39.934 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[laughs]
-I really made it.

00:21:39.967 --> 00:21:42.369 position:13% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa, it'll be an honor
to play alongside you

00:21:42.402 --> 00:21:43.237 position:27% line:89% align:start
in the same team.

00:21:43.271 --> 00:21:44.806 position:21% line:89% align:start
It'll be incredible.

00:21:44.839 --> 00:21:45.807 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:49.677 position:27% line:89% align:start
50, 51, 52, 53...

00:21:53.514 --> 00:21:55.950 position:19% line:83% align:start
We have to let Tsubasa
go to Brazil.

00:21:55.983 --> 00:21:56.551 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:21:57.552 --> 00:21:59.486 position:24% line:83% align:start
My love, he really
wants to go over there.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.189 position:21% line:83% align:start
It'll be what's best
for him.

00:22:01.222 --> 00:22:03.057 position:10% line:89% align:start
Please don't stress over it.

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:04.025 position:21% line:89% align:start
We knew that this was

00:22:04.058 --> 00:22:05.726 position:30% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa's dream
for a while now.

00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:08.696 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, you're right.

00:22:08.729 --> 00:22:11.032 position:21% line:83% align:start
If he goes to Brazil,
he'll surely learn a lot.

00:22:11.065 --> 00:22:14.101 position:24% line:83% align:start
More than in Japan,
where he has less options.

00:22:14.135 --> 00:22:15.236 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:22:15.269 --> 00:22:18.039 position:16% line:83% align:start
You'll be a professional,
Tsubasa.

00:22:18.072 --> 00:22:19.406 position:38% line:89% align:start
99, 100.

00:22:20.208 --> 00:22:22.342 position:30% line:83% align:start
There, Roberto,
I can do 100.

00:22:22.375 --> 00:22:24.745 position:35% line:83% align:start
Very well.
Now do it 200 times.

00:22:24.779 --> 00:22:26.214 position:27% line:83% align:start
And use your head
while you're at it.

00:22:26.247 --> 00:22:27.447 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:33.386 position:27% line:83% align:start
One, two, three,
four, five, six,

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.756 position:24% line:89% align:start
seven, eight, nine.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:36.791 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...
