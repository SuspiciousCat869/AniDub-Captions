disappoint you, Tsubasa,

00:08:14.362 --> 00:08:15.763 position:13% line:89% align:start

after a very serious injury
on his foot.

a very big job.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.335 position:33% line:83% align:start
By the way,
I was meaning to ask you,

00:10:01.368 --> 00:10:02.703 position:24% line:89% align:start
how's Genzo doing?

00:10:02.736 --> 00:10:03.838 position:24% line:89% align:start
He's grown a lot.

00:10:04.939 --> 00:10:08.109 position:13% line:83% align:start
He's had to proof himself
to his team in Germany.

00:10:08.142 --> 00:10:11.580 position:21% line:83% align:start
And he's given them
great results so far.

00:10:11.612 --> 00:10:13.314 position:13% line:89% align:start
I trained him well enough

00:10:13.347 --> 00:10:16.117 position:16% line:83% align:start
for him to be on his own
for now.

I worry that without
a strong rival,

00:10:28.295 --> 00:10:29.230 position:24% line:89% align:start
he may slow down.

You'll pay for that!

00:20:08.341 --> 00:20:11.311 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's the first time Misugi
attacks directly.

00:20:11.344 --> 00:20:13.781 position:27% line:83% align:start
He used to only
assist before.

00:20:13.815 --> 00:20:14.982 position:13% line:89% align:start
Maybe it could be because

he was on rehabilitation,

Kojiro, if you keep playing

you'll never be able to

You bastard!
