every ounce of strength

00:01:30.825 --> 00:01:31.960 position:16% line:89% align:start
Destroy what little pride

Genzo Wakabayashi...

Did you already forget
the promise you made to me?

00:03:40.154 --> 00:03:41.856 position:24% line:83% align:start
You said you'd win

until the finals.

00:03:43.124 --> 00:03:44.859 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're the captain now.

00:03:44.892 --> 00:03:45.993 position:19% line:89% align:start
Will you let them down?

00:03:46.027 --> 00:03:47.895 position:21% line:83% align:start
Your team needs you.
Answer me.

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:49.997 position:27% line:83% align:start
So now you won't
talk either?

00:03:50.031 --> 00:03:52.734 position:44% line:83% align:start
Uh...
This is hard, Genzo.

00:03:52.767 --> 00:03:54.769 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Genzo] Don't tell me
I spent all this time

00:03:54.802 --> 00:03:56.104 position:16% line:89% align:start
recovering for no reason.

00:03:56.137 --> 00:03:57.672 position:24% line:89% align:start
Answer me, Tsubasa.

00:03:57.705 --> 00:03:59.907 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you willing to let
everybody down?

00:03:59.941 --> 00:04:00.908 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uhh...

00:04:00.942 --> 00:04:03.243 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Roberto] Listen to
your teammate, Tsubasa.

00:04:03.276 --> 00:04:04.011 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-[Roberto] Tell me you're

00:04:04.045 --> 00:04:05.813 position:21% line:89% align:start
you're not giving up.

00:04:05.847 --> 00:04:09.016 position:16% line:83% align:start
Or maybe...you don't want
to go to Brazil anymore?

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.518 position:30% line:89% align:start
Answer us now.

00:04:10.551 --> 00:04:11.451 position:35% line:89% align:start
Roberto...

00:04:11.886 --> 00:04:12.820 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:04:12.854 --> 00:04:14.354 position:24% line:83% align:start
I won't forgive you
if you don't play like

00:04:14.387 --> 00:04:16.023 position:27% line:89% align:start
your usual self.

00:04:16.057 --> 00:04:17.457 position:24% line:89% align:start
You need to get up.

00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:19.292 position:30% line:83% align:start
You need to win
today's match.

00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:20.895 position:16% line:89% align:start
Do it for everyone here.

00:04:20.928 --> 00:04:22.395 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasp]
Hmm...

00:04:23.765 --> 00:04:24.699 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Genzo]
Tsubasa...

00:04:24.732 --> 00:04:26.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
do you still remember
the day

00:04:26.067 --> 00:04:27.300 position:19% line:89% align:start
we met playing soccer?

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.704 position:16% line:89% align:start
You and I were rivals...

00:04:29.737 --> 00:04:30.738 position:24% line:89% align:start
and that rivalry...

00:04:30.772 --> 00:04:33.306 position:21% line:83% align:start
is what made us play
with everything we had

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.609 position:30% line:89% align:start
until the end.

00:04:34.642 --> 00:04:36.844 position:27% line:83% align:start
We share the same
fighting spirit.

00:04:38.112 --> 00:04:38.679 position:27% line:89% align:start
Get the hell up.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.016 position:21% line:83% align:start
We still have a goal
we need to reach.

00:04:42.049 --> 00:04:44.252 position:30% line:83% align:start
To beat Kojiro
in the finals.

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:45.485 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh...

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.622 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Genzo] I've trained hard,
just like you have.

00:04:47.655 --> 00:04:48.623 position:35% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa...

00:04:48.656 --> 00:04:52.093 position:27% line:83% align:start
I won't allow you
to ruin everybody's dreams.

00:04:52.126 --> 00:04:54.494 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're not alone.
We're all here with you.

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.829 position:38% line:89% align:start
Wake up.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.898 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Uh...
-[Taro] You should listen

00:04:56.931 --> 00:04:58.331 position:35% line:83% align:start
-to Genzo.
-Huh?

00:04:58.365 --> 00:04:59.534 position:21% line:89% align:start
Jun is right as well.

00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:00.768 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's waiting for you
to play,

00:05:00.802 --> 00:05:03.571 position:30% line:83% align:start
giving your all
like always have, Tsubasa.

00:05:03.604 --> 00:05:03.838 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:04.672 --> 00:05:07.108 position:19% line:83% align:start
You can't let him down
like this.

00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:08.576 position:19% line:83% align:start
Nor can you disappoint
the team

00:05:08.609 --> 00:05:10.778 position:27% line:83% align:start
that's been there
by your side.

00:05:10.812 --> 00:05:12.412 position:16% line:83% align:start
We're all counting on you
to make it

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:14.148 position:33% line:83% align:start
to the finals
of the tournament.

00:05:14.182 --> 00:05:15.216 position:27% line:83% align:start
And you shouldn't
forget that...

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:16.884 position:10% line:89% align:start
the ball is our best friend.

[laughs]

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:33.668 position:24% line:89% align:start

Do it, Tsubasa.

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:42.877 position:10% line:89% align:start
Please forgive me, you guys.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.080 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry for the way I've
been playing up until now.

00:05:46.113 --> 00:05:47.849 position:27% line:83% align:start
I forgot how much
this opportunity

00:05:47.882 --> 00:05:48.983 position:19% line:89% align:start
really means everyone.

00:05:49.851 --> 00:05:51.118 position:21% line:89% align:start
And to me as well...

00:05:51.152 --> 00:05:53.020 position:10% line:89% align:start
This match means everything.

00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:55.089 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm going to play...

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:57.490 position:21% line:89% align:start
But this time around,

00:05:57.525 --> 00:05:59.927 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm not holding
anything back anymore.

that easily.

Doctor, please tell us.

00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:32.059 position:30% line:89% align:start

00:11:32.092 --> 00:11:32.960 position:27% line:89% align:start
Look here, Coach.

00:11:32.993 --> 00:11:34.461 position:19% line:83% align:start
[doctor] It looks like
the excess heat

00:11:34.495 --> 00:11:35.863 position:13% line:89% align:start
in his body from the match,

00:11:35.896 --> 00:11:37.965 position:24% line:83% align:start
and the huge strain
in his muscles...

00:11:37.998 --> 00:11:39.934 position:27% line:83% align:start
made him get sick

under a lot of pressure.

00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:43.938 position:27% line:83% align:start
I think we should
