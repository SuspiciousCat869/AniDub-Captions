So then, you're living

If I remember correctly,
your dad's a painter, right?

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yes, that's right.
My dad's a painter.

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:22.937 position:13% line:83% align:start
I wasn't able to thank you
for that nice gift

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.438 position:19% line:89% align:start
you gave me last time.

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:27.608 position:30% line:83% align:start
That ball with
all of your signatures

00:03:27.642 --> 00:03:29.577 position:24% line:83% align:start
has become a very
important thing for me.

You know what, Misaki?

00:03:30.978 --> 00:03:33.480 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm also very grateful
for my gift.

00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:35.083 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's already been
three years

00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:37.085 position:30% line:83% align:start
since we last
saw each other.

00:03:37.118 --> 00:03:39.087 position:19% line:83% align:start
I never imagined that
out of all people,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.488 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'd run into you here,
in this German city.

00:03:41.522 --> 00:03:44.559 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yes, it turns out that I'm
currently on vacation...

00:03:44.592 --> 00:03:46.326 position:30% line:83% align:start
and I knew I'd
find you here.

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.695 position:19% line:89% align:start
So I came to see you.

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:48.730 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, but wait...

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.298 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why didn't you ever call us?

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:52.800 position:19% line:83% align:start
Nobody heard anything
from you.

00:03:52.834 --> 00:03:53.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
We were worried about you.

00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:55.036 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Taro]
I'm sorry.

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.671 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've been very busy
since I got here.

00:03:57.872 --> 00:04:01.075 position:13% line:83% align:start
In fact...I just found out
you were going to be here...

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.111 position:30% line:83% align:start
in Hamburg from
a soccer magazine.

00:04:03.144 --> 00:04:04.277 position:35% line:89% align:start
Seriously?

00:04:04.311 --> 00:04:05.980 position:19% line:83% align:start
You found out about me
through a magazine?

00:04:06.013 --> 00:04:06.881 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mhm.

00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:07.982 position:27% line:83% align:start
And according to
the article,

00:04:08.015 --> 00:04:09.316 position:16% line:89% align:start
you've greatly improved.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.418 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Genzo]
Yeah, but not enough...

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:14.622 position:16% line:83% align:start
since I'm still playing
in Division II.

00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:16.758 position:21% line:83% align:start
But I'm not worried,
because...

00:04:16.791 --> 00:04:18.860 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm positive that
I'll soon be playing

00:04:18.893 --> 00:04:20.128 position:10% line:89% align:start
in the professional leagues.

00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:22.362 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yes, I'm sure you will.

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:23.798 position:10% line:89% align:start
Tell me something, Misaki...

00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:26.033 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're still playing soccer,
am I right?

00:04:28.236 --> 00:04:29.704 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yes, of course.

00:04:29.737 --> 00:04:30.538 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:32.272 position:24% line:83% align:start
It doesn't matter
where I am.

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:34.509 position:19% line:83% align:start
I keep playing soccer
on my own.

00:04:34.542 --> 00:04:35.777 position:16% line:89% align:start
In fact, here in Europe,

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:37.545 position:19% line:89% align:start
soccer is more serious

00:04:37.578 --> 00:04:39.547 position:10% line:83% align:start
-than in our beloved Japan.
-Hey, I'm open!

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.682 position:27% line:83% align:start
They have a very
interesting style.

00:04:41.716 --> 00:04:42.717 position:41% line:89% align:start
It is.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.653 position:13% line:83% align:start
And I'm happy you haven't
abandoned the game.

00:04:45.686 --> 00:04:47.155 position:30% line:83% align:start
French soccer
is very similar

00:04:47.188 --> 00:04:49.023 position:10% line:89% align:start
to soccer in Latin America,

00:04:49.056 --> 00:04:50.357 position:16% line:89% align:start
because it allows you to

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.560 position:21% line:83% align:start
-grow independently.
-I'm open! Pass!

00:04:52.593 --> 00:04:55.362 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's practically
a more artistic style.

00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:56.664 position:41% line:83% align:start
Wooh!
We can do this!

00:04:56.697 --> 00:04:58.431 position:33% line:83% align:start
Hey, listen,
what do you say...

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:01.269 position:21% line:83% align:start

the good old days, huh?

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.302 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Mhm.
-Here! Get the ball!

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:04.238 position:13% line:89% align:start

-Yeah!

00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:08.509 position:16% line:89% align:start

Can you tell us how
we can shoot like that?

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:38.272 position:30% line:83% align:start
Well, honestly,
it's not that difficult.

00:05:38.306 --> 00:05:39.406 position:33% line:89% align:start
You just...

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:40.741 position:27% line:83% align:start
have to practice
with the ball

00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:43.277 position:24% line:83% align:start
every single day
and without fail.

00:05:43.311 --> 00:05:44.779 position:24% line:83% align:start
That will give you

is to become friends

00:05:49.717 --> 00:05:51.819 position:16% line:83% align:start

[Yukari] What?

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:56.083 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're leaving

00:06:56.117 --> 00:06:57.285 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yes, I'm sorry.

00:06:57.318 --> 00:06:58.286 position:19% line:89% align:start
I had planned to spend

00:06:58.319 --> 00:06:59.553 position:24% line:83% align:start
some time with you

in the end.

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:07.361 position:30% line:83% align:start
After watching

I realized we had
no time to lose.

00:07:09.664 --> 00:07:12.166 position:27% line:83% align:start
We must practice
so we can become stronger.

Even though we're
a superior team,

00:07:13.935 --> 00:07:15.836 position:16% line:83% align:start
we can't afford to take
any chances.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.772 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yes, we can't rest on
our laurels.

00:07:17.805 --> 00:07:18.839 position:30% line:89% align:start
We must train.

00:07:18.873 --> 00:07:20.641 position:24% line:83% align:start

-Yukari, send this message

00:07:22.276 --> 00:07:23.544 position:13% line:89% align:start
Tell them the Hirado team

00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:25.112 position:35% line:83% align:start

the rest of the teams

00:18:42.356 --> 00:18:43.457 position:35% line:83% align:start
Well, yeah,
they're the ones

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.627 position:24% line:83% align:start
that disqualified
the Naniwa team.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.460 position:33% line:89% align:start

00:18:46.493 --> 00:18:47.394 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mhm.

00:18:47.427 --> 00:18:49.864 position:33% line:83% align:start
Yes, in fact,
they defeated them easily.

00:18:49.897 --> 00:18:51.431 position:24% line:83% align:start
The Azumaichi team
is known for

00:18:51.465 --> 00:18:52.800 position:33% line:83% align:start
adapting to
their opponents defense

00:18:52.834 --> 00:18:53.935 position:16% line:89% align:start
and then counterattack.

00:18:53.968 --> 00:18:55.335 position:16% line:83% align:start
But the interesting part
is that

00:18:55.369 --> 00:18:57.337 position:24% line:83% align:start
their goal scorer
isn't a forward,

00:18:57.371 --> 00:18:59.339 position:19% line:89% align:start
he only plays defense.

00:18:59.373 --> 00:19:00.074 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

00:19:00.108 --> 00:19:01.542 position:16% line:89% align:start
His name is Makoto Soda.

00:19:01.576 --> 00:19:05.278 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's number 7 in his team
and he's their main defense.

00:19:05.312 --> 00:19:06.480 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:19:06.514 --> 00:19:08.148 position:19% line:83% align:start
[makoto] According to
the score board,

00:19:08.181 --> 00:19:09.416 position:24% line:89% align:start
the Azumaichi team

00:19:09.449 --> 00:19:11.318 position:24% line:83% align:start
has the most points
in their city.

00:19:11.351 --> 00:19:12.486 position:24% line:89% align:start
That player, Soda,

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.657 position:10% line:83% align:start
was able to defeat Nakanishi
quite easily.

00:19:17.125 --> 00:19:18.960 position:19% line:89% align:start
So he plays defense...

00:19:18.993 --> 00:19:21.361 position:13% line:83% align:start
Finally, a worthy opponent
for me.

[Ryo] It's Hanji and

Now you keep your promise!

00:21:14.575 --> 00:21:16.409 position:16% line:83% align:start
You have to win for us,
you got that?

00:21:16.443 --> 00:21:18.345 position:24% line:89% align:start
Come on Nankatsu!

00:21:18.378 --> 00:21:20.480 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll never forgive you
if you lose.

00:21:20.515 --> 00:21:22.016 position:33% line:83% align:start
Don't worry,
that's not gonna happen...

00:21:22.049 --> 00:21:22.750 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Makoto]
Hey, you!

00:21:22.784 --> 00:21:23.350 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Shut up!
-Huh?

00:21:23.383 --> 00:21:24.752 position:16% line:89% align:start
Would you be quiet now?

00:21:24.786 --> 00:21:25.787 position:27% line:89% align:start
And who are you?

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:26.854 position:30% line:89% align:start
If I were you,

00:21:26.888 --> 00:21:29.289 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't be so sure
you're gonna win this.

00:21:29.322 --> 00:21:30.423 position:10% line:89% align:start
What did you say, you idiot?

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:31.826 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Stop, calm down.

00:21:33.594 --> 00:21:35.362 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're Tsubasa Ozora,
am I right?

00:21:35.395 --> 00:21:38.331 position:16% line:83% align:start
You don't seem as strong
as everyone says.

00:21:38.365 --> 00:21:39.299 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's a pleasure.

00:21:39.332 --> 00:21:41.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm in charge of
marking you.

00:21:41.368 --> 00:21:42.302 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, young man.

00:21:42.335 --> 00:21:43.704 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Mind your manners here.
-Huh?

00:21:43.738 --> 00:21:45.573 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you keep harassing
the other teams,

00:21:45.606 --> 00:21:47.575 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll be forced to
throw you out of the game.

00:21:47.608 --> 00:21:48.876 position:27% line:83% align:start
Do you hear me?
Go to your side, now!

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:52.345 position:10% line:83% align:start
All right. I've understood.
I'm sorry.

00:21:52.379 --> 00:21:54.715 position:10% line:89% align:start
That player was Makoto Soda.

[whistle]

00:22:14.669 --> 00:22:17.470 position:10% line:83% align:start
[announcer] And the National
Tournament has begun!

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.541 position:24% line:89% align:start
Bunch of idiots...

00:22:20.575 --> 00:22:24.145 position:10% line:83% align:start
They don't know who they're
facing this time around!
