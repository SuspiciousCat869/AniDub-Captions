00:15:26.528 --> 00:15:27.327 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:15:27.361 --> 00:15:29.396 position:27% line:83% align:start
This will give us
the energy we need

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:30.030 position:16% line:89% align:start
to win this time around.

00:15:31.198 --> 00:15:33.868 position:10% line:83% align:start
I hope that with this water,
you'll have enough energy

00:15:33.902 --> 00:15:35.202 position:27% line:83% align:start
not to fall down
on the ground

00:15:35.235 --> 00:15:37.572 position:30% line:83% align:start
like you did in
that last play, Tsubasa.

00:15:37.605 --> 00:15:38.205 position:38% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:15:38.238 --> 00:15:40.407 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm alive and kicking now.

00:15:40.441 --> 00:15:42.677 position:16% line:83% align:start
We would've won the first
match against Meiwa

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.111 position:21% line:89% align:start
if we had extra time.

00:15:44.144 --> 00:15:45.946 position:13% line:83% align:start
What're you talking about,
Ishizaki?

00:15:45.979 --> 00:15:47.849 position:16% line:83% align:start
Remember? In that match,
you got injured

00:15:47.882 --> 00:15:50.083 position:21% line:83% align:start
and you weren't even
playing all that well.

00:15:50.117 --> 00:15:51.318 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, how could we forget?

00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:53.086 position:33% line:83% align:start
Takeshi and I
were arguing over

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.823 position:21% line:83% align:start
who would replace you
on the field.

00:15:54.856 --> 00:15:56.056 position:19% line:89% align:start
We'd say, "We'll see!"

00:15:56.089 --> 00:15:57.759 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but it ended up
being Misaki

00:15:57.792 --> 00:15:59.092 position:21% line:89% align:start
who took your place.

00:15:59.126 --> 00:16:03.130 position:16% line:83% align:start
That day, Team Nankatsu's
famous golden duo was born.

00:16:03.163 --> 00:16:06.233 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, guys, I don't want you
to overexert yourselves.

00:16:06.266 --> 00:16:09.102 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'll both be champions
if we keep the game tied.

00:16:09.136 --> 00:16:10.738 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't agree with that,
Coach.

00:16:10.772 --> 00:16:11.673 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:16:11.706 --> 00:16:12.907 position:35% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa...

00:16:12.941 --> 00:16:14.709 position:21% line:83% align:start
We lost against Meiwa
during the first round,

00:16:14.742 --> 00:16:15.710 position:38% line:89% align:start
remember?

00:16:15.743 --> 00:16:18.078 position:21% line:83% align:start
I won't be satisfied
with a tie.

00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:21.281 position:19% line:83% align:start
This time, we will play
to win the tournament.

00:16:21.315 --> 00:16:24.017 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Ah, yes!
-Yeah, come on, guys!

00:16:24.051 --> 00:16:25.452 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Let's do it!
-Want some water?

00:16:27.254 --> 00:16:28.923 position:16% line:89% align:start
It'll be an all-out war.

00:16:28.957 --> 00:16:30.057 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.761 position:16% line:83% align:start
Team Meiwa doesn't draw.
We play to win.

00:16:33.795 --> 00:16:35.462 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's Meiwa's
style of play.

00:16:35.496 --> 00:16:37.331 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now is when we need to
attack more.

00:16:37.364 --> 00:16:39.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't you agree with me,
coach Kira?

00:16:39.767 --> 00:16:40.802 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're right.

00:16:40.835 --> 00:16:43.070 position:19% line:83% align:start
We won't be happy with
a measly draw.

00:16:43.103 --> 00:16:45.707 position:24% line:83% align:start
You have to attack
until you achieve victory.

00:16:47.174 --> 00:16:49.243 position:13% line:83% align:start
Looks like the soccer gods
smiled upon us

00:16:49.276 --> 00:16:51.111 position:21% line:83% align:start
and brought the rain
to give Tsubasa

00:16:51.144 --> 00:16:52.346 position:19% line:89% align:start
all the energy he lost.

00:16:52.379 --> 00:16:54.481 position:21% line:83% align:start
Exactly. That's what
it looks like, ma'am.

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:57.084 position:35% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa...

00:16:57.117 --> 00:16:58.218 position:35% line:89% align:start
Forgive me.

00:16:58.252 --> 00:17:00.187 position:21% line:83% align:start
You know, I'm afraid
if I keep playing...

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.825 position:19% line:83% align:start
I will end up being in
the way of our teammates.

00:17:03.858 --> 00:17:05.025 position:19% line:89% align:start
Are you saying that...

00:17:05.058 --> 00:17:06.661 position:16% line:89% align:start
cuz your foot is hurting?

00:17:06.694 --> 00:17:08.328 position:13% line:89% align:start
The pain isn't the problem.

00:17:08.362 --> 00:17:12.065 position:21% line:83% align:start
I would keep playing
even if my foot was broken.

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:13.200 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's just that

00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:14.401 position:30% line:83% align:start
my performance
as a player...

00:17:14.434 --> 00:17:15.637 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa]
Stop talking nonsense.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:16.470 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:16.504 --> 00:17:18.506 position:24% line:83% align:start
Misaki, I need you
and Wakabayashi

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.140 position:24% line:83% align:start
now more than ever
to be with me

00:17:20.173 --> 00:17:21.709 position:19% line:89% align:start
so we can score a goal.

00:17:21.743 --> 00:17:22.810 position:41% line:89% align:start
But...

00:17:22.844 --> 00:17:23.945 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's true, Taro.

00:17:23.978 --> 00:17:25.980 position:19% line:83% align:start
If we want to score on
Wakashimazu...

00:17:26.014 --> 00:17:27.180 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're our last resort.

00:17:27.214 --> 00:17:29.851 position:21% line:83% align:start
All we've got left is
Nankatsu's golden duo.

00:17:29.884 --> 00:17:30.618 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Hm...
-Hm...

00:17:30.652 --> 00:17:31.351 position:27% line:89% align:start
We'll do this...

00:17:32.152 --> 00:17:34.087 position:30% line:83% align:start
We'll let Meiwa
attack first.

00:17:34.121 --> 00:17:35.289 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:17:35.322 --> 00:17:37.792 position:21% line:83% align:start
I want you to rest up
until I give the signal.

00:17:37.825 --> 00:17:39.192 position:21% line:89% align:start
Are you sure, Genzo?

00:17:39.226 --> 00:17:41.930 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hey, everyone,
we're going to defend first.

00:17:41.963 --> 00:17:43.330 position:21% line:83% align:start
We have to stop them
from scoring,

00:17:43.363 --> 00:17:46.099 position:24% line:83% align:start
so Taro and Tsubasa
can get their energy back.

00:17:46.133 --> 00:17:49.169 position:10% line:83% align:start
And then, Tsubasa and Misaki
will attack.

00:17:49.202 --> 00:17:51.405 position:41% line:83% align:start
Great!
That's an excellent plan.

00:17:51.438 --> 00:17:53.240 position:30% line:83% align:start
Let's go ahead
and defend our goal.

00:17:53.273 --> 00:17:55.043 position:33% line:83% align:start
I think it's
a really good plan!

00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:56.109 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that way,

00:17:56.143 --> 00:17:57.745 position:27% line:83% align:start
we'll be able to
recover our strength.
