[grunting]

00:06:39.934 --> 00:06:41.802 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Oh...
-Oh...

00:06:41.836 --> 00:06:44.105 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey! Tsubasa!

00:06:44.138 --> 00:06:45.573 position:21% line:89% align:start
How's it going, Ryo?

00:06:45.606 --> 00:06:46.807 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[chuckle]
-Huh?

00:06:46.841 --> 00:06:49.644 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm really glad
you made it, Tsubasa!

00:06:51.946 --> 00:06:52.847 position:35% line:89% align:start
Going up!

00:06:54.315 --> 00:06:55.783 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:06:55.816 --> 00:06:57.118 position:41% line:89% align:start
Whoa!

00:06:57.151 --> 00:06:58.219 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:06:58.252 --> 00:06:58.986 position:47% line:89% align:start
-W

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.721 position:47% line:83% align:start
ow
-Nice move!

00:07:00.755 --> 00:07:02.790 position:13% line:83% align:start
-[Tsubasa] Heads up, Ryo!
-Huh?

00:07:02.823 --> 00:07:03.456 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yell]

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.558 position:35% line:89% align:start
I got it!

00:07:05.593 --> 00:07:07.561 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[grunt] Oops...
-[sigh]

00:07:09.697 --> 00:07:11.599 position:19% line:83% align:start
-How is it going, man?
-[chuckle]

00:07:11.632 --> 00:07:13.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm just really excited
that you are here.

00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:15.468 position:35% line:83% align:start
But wait,
where is Roberto?

00:07:15.503 --> 00:07:17.672 position:10% line:89% align:start
He said he'll be here later.

00:07:17.705 --> 00:07:18.673 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groan]

00:07:18.706 --> 00:07:20.775 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are those the guys
from the team?

00:07:20.808 --> 00:07:21.876 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:22.176 position:47% line:89% align:start
[c

00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:23.544 position:38% line:89% align:start
huckle]

00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:25.513 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Ryo] They look like
really good players,

00:07:25.546 --> 00:07:27.548 position:16% line:83% align:start
-but they're really not!
-Ugh...

00:07:27.581 --> 00:07:28.683 position:30% line:89% align:start
Not cool, Ryo!

00:07:28.716 --> 00:07:29.884 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why're you trying
to embarrass us?

00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:31.886 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're the worst one
in the whole team, man!

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:34.555 position:24% line:83% align:start
Show some respect!
I'm still your captain!

00:07:34.588 --> 00:07:35.589 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Ryo]
In any case, things are rea

00:07:35.623 --> 00:07:38.125 position:35% line:83% align:start
lly about
to change around here...

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:39.627 position:35% line:83% align:start
thanks to
our new star player!

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.594 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's nice to meet ya.

00:07:40.628 --> 00:07:42.196 position:19% line:89% align:start
Nice to meet you too.

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:43.664 position:5% line:83% align:start
Listen, I'm
really grateful

00:07:43.698 --> 00:07:45.232 position:24% line:83% align:start
that you helped us
get our field back.

00:07:45.266 --> 00:07:46.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
I wish I would've
been there.

00:07:46.667 --> 00:07:49.403 position:13% line:83% align:start
I wish I would've seen you
score that goal on Genzo.

00:07:49.437 --> 00:07:50.972 position:27% line:83% align:start
I would've liked
to see that too!

00:07:51.005 --> 00:07:51.872 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:07:51.906 --> 00:07:53.641 position:16% line:83% align:start
-[Manabu] By the way...
-Huh?

00:07:53.674 --> 00:07:55.609 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is it really true
what Ryo said?

00:07:55.643 --> 00:07:57.712 position:24% line:83% align:start
That you're going
to join our team?

00:07:57.745 --> 00:07:58.412 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hm...

00:07:58.446 --> 00:07:59.413 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hm...

00:07:59.447 --> 00:08:01.515 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Uh-huh. Yes, I am!
-Ah!

00:08:01.549 --> 00:08:03.818 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's right... I've already
transferred to Nankatsu.

00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:05.820 position:10% line:89% align:start
We're going to be teammates.

00:08:05.853 --> 00:08:06.854 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ah!
-Ah!

00:08:06.887 --> 00:08:08.356 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:08:08.389 --> 00:08:09.623 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Let's go!
-Yeah, that's awesome!

00:08:09.657 --> 00:08:12.326 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm really happy you're
going to be in our team!

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.695 position:33% line:83% align:start
See guys...?
I told you, didn't I?

00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:16.097 position:21% line:83% align:start
And on top of that,
a star player

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.899 position:10% line:83% align:start
from Brazil's national team
is going to be our coach!

00:08:18.933 --> 00:08:19.499 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Whoa!

00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:20.768 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm telling you, guys.

00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:22.570 position:19% line:83% align:start
Nankatsu's soccer team
this year

00:08:22.603 --> 00:08:24.472 position:13% line:89% align:start
is going to totally rule!

00:08:24.505 --> 00:08:26.140 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

00:08:30.745 --> 00:08:31.912 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Mr. Mikami]
 <i>Genzo...</i>

00:08:31.946 --> 00:08:33.914 position:24% line:83% align:start
How's your injury
coming along?

00:08:33.948 --> 00:08:34.749 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't you reme

00:08:34.782 --> 00:08:36.784 position:33% line:83% align:start
mber you're
supposed to be resting?

00:08:38.953 --> 00:08:40.588 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't have
any time to rest.

00:08:41.555 --> 00:08:42.590 position:21% line:89% align:start
I have to get ready.

00:08:45.426 --> 00:08:46.961 position:21% line:83% align:start
The fact that no one
scored a goal on me

00:08:46.994 --> 00:08:50.297 position:13% line:83% align:start
at the national tournament
made me over-confident.

00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:51.665 position:5% line:83% align:start
That will not
happen again.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.869 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't let that kid
get into your head.

00:08:54.902 --> 00:08:57.605 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

00:08:57.638 --> 00:09:00.674 position:19% line:83% align:start
If I can't stop him at
the inter-school tournament,

00:09:00.708 --> 00:09:02.543 position:13% line:83% align:start
becoming national champion
last year

00:09:02.576 --> 00:09:03.611 position:13% line:89% align:start
will mean nothing at all.

00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:06.614 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:09:12.553 --> 00:09:14.855 position:10% line:83% align:start
We'll start today's training
with a few laps.

00:09:14.889 --> 00:09:17.458 position:33% line:83% align:start
Then pair up
to practice passing.

00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:19.326 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Let's go!
-[group] All right!

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.194 position:35% line:89% align:start
[panting]

00:09:23.264 --> 00:09:24.665 position:35% line:83% align:start
[panting]
Tsubasa...

00:09:24.698 --> 00:09:25.633 position:13% line:89% align:start
You wanna pair up with me

00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:27.502 position:19% line:83% align:start
-to practice passing?
-Yeah!

00:09:27.536 --> 00:09:30.738 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:09:44.685 --> 00:09:45.920 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Ryo]
Say, Tsubasa...

00:09:45.953 --> 00:09:46.921 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah?

00:09:46.954 --> 00:09:48.722 position:24% line:83% align:start
There is something
I've been wondering

00:09:48.756 --> 00:09:50.624 position:27% line:83% align:start
since I saw you
play yesterday.

00:09:50.658 --> 00:09:52.793 position:24% line:83% align:start
How is it possible
that you're so good?

00:09:52.827 --> 00:09:54.028 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I've never
heard of you

00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:56.330 position:19% line:83% align:start
playing in a national
tournament before.

00:09:56.363 --> 00:09:59.066 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Ryo] Didn't your old school
have a soccer team?

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.267 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:10:00.301 --> 00:10:01.435 position:33% line:89% align:start
They did...

00:10:01.469 --> 00:10:02.770 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's just that...

00:10:02.803 --> 00:10:04.638 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa]
It really wasn't too good...

00:10:04.672 --> 00:10:06.273 position:21% line:89% align:start
Even with you there?

00:10:06.307 --> 00:10:07.308 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:10:07.341 --> 00:10:08.109 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Tsubasa] To be honest,

00:10:08.142 --> 00:10:10.611 position:21% line:89% align:start
the problem was that

00:10:10.644 --> 00:10:13.714 position:21% line:83% align:start
none of my teammates
really loved soccer.

00:10:13.747 --> 00:10:15.116 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa] Some of them
would quit practice

00:10:15.149 --> 00:10:16.585 position:16% line:89% align:start
because it was too hard.

00:10:16.617 --> 00:10:18.587 position:21% line:83% align:start
I guess you get that
with every team.

00:10:18.652 --> 00:10:20.888 position:19% line:83% align:start
Everyone just wants to
take the easy way out.

00:10:20.921 --> 00:10:23.157 position:19% line:83% align:start
But not everyone wants
to work hard for it.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.793 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah... Some kids just
don't like to work hard.

00:10:25.826 --> 00:10:29.430 position:13% line:83% align:start
But that's the whole point
of practicing, right?

00:10:29.463 --> 00:10:32.433 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, Tsubasa... You don't
have to worry about that.

00:10:32.466 --> 00:10:33.634 position:19% line:89% align:start
All of us love soccer.

00:10:33.667 --> 00:10:34.869 position:33% line:89% align:start
Right, guys?

00:10:34.902 --> 00:10:35.269 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Yeah!

00:10:35.302 --> 00:10:37.238 position:33% line:89% align:start
-We love it!

00:10:37.271 --> 00:10:38.973 position:19% line:89% align:start
We definitely love it.

00:10:39.006 --> 00:10:40.741 position:30% line:83% align:start
If we didn't,
we wouldn't even bother

00:10:40.774 --> 00:10:43.545 position:19% line:83% align:start
taking a beating from
Shutetsu every year.

00:10:43.578 --> 00:10:44.645 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hm...

00:10:45.547 --> 00:10:46.581 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:46.615 --> 00:10:48.082 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa]
Who are those guys?

00:10:48.115 --> 00:10:48.916 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:10:53.555 --> 00:10:54.589 position:38% line:89% align:start
Huh?What

00:10:54.623 --> 00:10:55.823 position:33% line:83% align:start
are you guys
doing here?

00:11:09.737 --> 00:11:11.939 position:16% line:89% align:start
You look surprised, Ryo!

00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:12.907 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hanji!

00:11:13.608 --> 00:11:14.942 position:21% line:89% align:start
Who are these guys?

00:11:14.975 --> 00:11:17.044 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's the soccer team
from Nishigaoka...

00:11:17.077 --> 00:11:19.413 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Manabu] It's a school from
our neighbouring town...

00:11:19.446 --> 00:11:21.982 position:33% line:83% align:start
and they are
really really good!

00:11:22.016 --> 00:11:24.586 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're here just as
we promised we'd be.

00:11:24.619 --> 00:11:26.720 position:27% line:83% align:start
What promise are
you talking about?

00:11:26.754 --> 00:11:28.956 position:30% line:83% align:start
Don't tell me
you forgot already?

00:11:28.989 --> 00:11:30.057 position:21% line:83% align:start
You were practically
begging us

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.959 position:16% line:83% align:start
to have a practice match
with us.

00:11:31.992 --> 00:11:33.294 position:38% line:89% align:start
What...?

00:11:33.327 --> 00:11:34.128 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Roberto]
Hi, guys!

00:11:35.496 --> 00:11:36.931 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Ryo]
Hey, Roberto!

00:11:36.964 --> 00:11:39.433 position:24% line:83% align:start
This friendly game
was my idea, guys...

00:11:39.466 --> 00:11:40.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Ryo] And why would
you do that

00:11:40.467 --> 00:11:41.869 position:16% line:89% align:start
without letting us know?

00:11:41.902 --> 00:11:43.837 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Plus, you're late!
-[laugh]

00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:46.106 position:41% line:83% align:start
What?!
Is that Roberto Hongo?

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.341 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:49.410 position:13% line:83% align:start
But wait... It looks like
he's been drinking...

00:11:49.443 --> 00:11:50.844 position:33% line:83% align:start
Are you sure
that's really him?

00:11:50.878 --> 00:11:52.479 position:24% line:83% align:start
What are you guys
talking about?

00:11:52.514 --> 00:11:53.814 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't you recognize him?

00:11:53.847 --> 00:11:55.149 position:16% line:89% align:start
He's a super star player

00:11:55.182 --> 00:11:57.351 position:19% line:83% align:start
that has been all over
the news lately!

00:11:57.384 --> 00:11:58.452 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are you for real?

00:11:58.485 --> 00:12:00.622 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Masato]
Are you sure he's okay?

00:12:00.655 --> 00:12:02.591 position:16% line:83% align:start
It looks like he's been
drinking all day.

00:12:02.624 --> 00:12:04.626 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't let first impressions
fool you.

00:12:04.659 --> 00:12:06.927 position:13% line:89% align:start
This guy's the real deal!

00:12:06.961 --> 00:12:08.963 position:21% line:83% align:start
Is this the surprise
you were talking about?

00:12:08.996 --> 00:12:11.131 position:10% line:83% align:start
-A match against these guys?
-That's right!

00:12:11.165 --> 00:12:13.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
You guys really are
a disgraceful team.

00:12:13.234 --> 00:12:14.735 position:24% line:83% align:start
-What did you say?
-Your coach is

00:12:14.768 --> 00:12:17.104 position:21% line:89% align:start
just some drunk guy.

00:12:17.137 --> 00:12:18.405 position:33% line:89% align:start
Roberto is--

00:12:18.439 --> 00:12:19.306 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:20.307 --> 00:12:21.408 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-uh.

00:12:21.442 --> 00:12:22.843 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:12:22.876 --> 00:12:23.477 position:19% line:83% align:start
Listen... Even though
he looks

00:12:23.511 --> 00:12:25.846 position:27% line:89% align:start
different now...

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:27.515 position:33% line:83% align:start
He really is
a professional player

00:12:27.549 --> 00:12:29.450 position:10% line:89% align:start
from Brazil's national team.

00:12:29.483 --> 00:12:30.451 position:50% line:83% align:start
Are you serious?
[player 1]

00:12:30.484 --> 00:12:32.319 position:5% line:83% align:start
He was in
the spotlight for a while,

00:12:32.353 --> 00:12:33.487 position:10% line:89% align:start
but he suddenly disappeared.

00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:35.089 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's get ready, guys!

00:12:36.824 --> 00:12:38.459 position:27% line:83% align:start
Probably because
of all the drinking...

00:12:38.492 --> 00:12:39.661 position:33% line:89% align:start
Might be...

00:12:39.694 --> 00:12:40.928 position:38% line:89% align:start
[growl]

00:12:40.961 --> 00:12:42.796 position:27% line:83% align:start
You losers sure
picked a winner

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:44.331 position:30% line:83% align:start
-for a coach!
-Uh?

00:12:44.365 --> 00:12:47.535 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's no wonder all
you failures lost 30 to 0

00:12:47.569 --> 00:12:49.336 position:27% line:83% align:start
when you played
against Shutetsu.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.337 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?!

00:12:50.371 --> 00:12:50.838 position:38% line:89% align:start
-30 to 0

00:12:50.871 --> 00:12:52.674 position:47% line:83% align:start
?
-Wow!

00:12:52.707 --> 00:12:54.775 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:12:54.808 --> 00:12:57.144 position:10% line:83% align:start
Listen, guys, if we want to
take Shutetsu down

00:12:57.177 --> 00:12:58.946 position:19% line:83% align:start
during the tournament,
we have to make sure

00:12:58.979 --> 00:13:00.447 position:24% line:83% align:start
we score way more
goals than that.

00:13:00.481 --> 00:13:01.683 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laugh]

00:13:01.716 --> 00:13:02.950 position:30% line:89% align:start
Piece of cake!

00:13:02.983 --> 00:13:05.219 position:27% line:83% align:start
You better watch
your big mouth!

00:13:05.252 --> 00:13:06.220 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're gonna make you
take that back!

00:13:06.253 --> 00:13:08.322 position:16% line:83% align:start
Did they really beat you
30 to 0?

00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:10.190 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well... Yeah...

00:13:10.224 --> 00:13:13.460 position:10% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa! I'm counting on you
to help me shut them up!

00:13:13.494 --> 00:13:14.962 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Are you ready?
-Sure!

00:13:14.995 --> 00:13:17.197 position:27% line:83% align:start
All right then!
Let's get started...

00:13:17.231 --> 00:13:18.999 position:24% line:83% align:start
We better hurry up
before it gets dark.

00:13:19.033 --> 00:13:20.669 position:10% line:83% align:start
What are you talking about,
crazy guy?

00:13:20.702 --> 00:13:22.036 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's just noon!

00:13:31.713 --> 00:13:33.213 position:27% line:83% align:start
All right, guys.
Let's think about

00:13:33.247 --> 00:13:34.683 position:24% line:83% align:start
what our game plan
is going to be today.

00:13:34.716 --> 00:13:35.949 position:19% line:89% align:start
Before any of that...

00:13:35.983 --> 00:13:37.451 position:16% line:83% align:start
-What about that booze?
-Huh?

00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:40.020 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Ryo] You can't have that
out here in the field!

00:13:40.054 --> 00:13:42.423 position:38% line:83% align:start
[laugh]
Sorry about that.

00:13:42.456 --> 00:13:43.290 position:35% line:89% align:start
[growling]

00:13:43.324 --> 00:13:44.892 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't just hide it
in your pocket.

00:13:44.925 --> 00:13:46.528 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're supposed to throw it
in the garbage!

00:13:46.561 --> 00:13:48.395 position:24% line:83% align:start
But that would be
such a waste.

00:13:48.429 --> 00:13:50.130 position:5% line:89% align:start
I just bought this bottle.

00:13:50.164 --> 00:13:51.332 position:35% line:89% align:start
[growling]

00:13:51.365 --> 00:13:53.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're just going to
embarrass the whole team!

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.569 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just calm down, Ryo.

00:13:54.602 --> 00:13:56.236 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, by the way, guys...

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.305 position:24% line:83% align:start
Who is going to be
the team's captain?

00:13:58.339 --> 00:14:00.274 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, you could say that
I am the captain.

00:14:00.307 --> 00:14:01.475 position:21% line:89% align:start
Really? Since when?

00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:02.976 position:19% line:89% align:start
We never voted on it.

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.679 position:5% line:83% align:start
What are you
talking about?

00:14:04.713 --> 00:14:06.514 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've always been
the captain of this team!

00:14:06.548 --> 00:14:07.749 position:24% line:89% align:start
Very well, Ryo...

00:14:07.782 --> 00:14:09.049 position:19% line:89% align:start
But don't forget... Yo

00:14:09.083 --> 00:14:10.819 position:27% line:83% align:start
u're responsible
for guiding your teammates.

00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:12.986 position:16% line:89% align:start
No problem, I got this!

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.154 position:30% line:83% align:start
You always say
the same thing...

00:14:14.188 --> 00:14:16.390 position:24% line:83% align:start
...but all you do
is run around.

00:14:16.423 --> 00:14:17.525 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's enough out of you!

00:14:17.559 --> 00:14:18.660 position:27% line:89% align:start
Stay positive...

00:14:18.693 --> 00:14:19.960 position:10% line:89% align:start
The captain has to make sure

00:14:19.993 --> 00:14:22.429 position:21% line:83% align:start
the rest of the team
is motivated.

00:14:22.463 --> 00:14:23.997 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah!
-Roberto...

00:14:24.031 --> 00:14:25.533 position:16% line:83% align:start
So what's our game plan
gonna be?

00:14:25.567 --> 00:14:28.469 position:41% line:83% align:start
Hmmm,
that's a good question.

00:14:28.503 --> 00:14:30.437 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-I don't know yet.

00:14:30.471 --> 00:14:31.438 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:14:31.472 --> 00:14:33.240 position:13% line:83% align:start
I want to start by seeing
at what level

00:14:33.273 --> 00:14:34.509 position:27% line:89% align:start
each of you are.

00:14:34.542 --> 00:14:37.211 position:24% line:83% align:start
This friendly game
will be perfect for that.

00:14:37.244 --> 00:14:38.946 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Roberto] I'll be paying
close attention

00:14:38.979 --> 00:14:40.914 position:21% line:83% align:start
to what each of you
needs to improve.

00:14:40.948 --> 00:14:42.851 position:13% line:89% align:start
Give me your best effort.

00:14:42.883 --> 00:14:44.418 position:33% line:83% align:start
-All right!
-All right!

00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:45.720 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:14:45.754 --> 00:14:46.855 position:35% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa...

00:14:46.887 --> 00:14:48.623 position:21% line:89% align:start
What's up, Roberto?

00:14:48.656 --> 00:14:49.657 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't forget.

00:14:49.691 --> 00:14:50.391 position:30% line:89% align:start
Treat the ball

00:14:50.424 --> 00:14:52.627 position:21% line:89% align:start
as your best friend.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.395 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh?

This is a beautiful sport.

00:14:57.498 --> 00:14:59.166 position:5% line:83% align:start
You must play
it with love.

00:15:01.268 --> 00:15:02.035 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.All ri

00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:04.672 position:35% line:83% align:start
ght, guys,
let's do this!

00:15:04.706 --> 00:15:06.140 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Yes, Coach!
-Yes, Coach!

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.389 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, ref... Let's have
a great game today!

00:15:22.423 --> 00:15:23.525 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm sure we will.

is about to begin!

[referee]
20 minutes per half.

00:15:37.505 --> 00:15:39.908 position:13% line:89% align:start
Nishigaoka will kick off!

00:15:54.455 --> 00:15:55.389 position:27% line:89% align:start
All right, guys!

00:15:55.422 --> 00:15:58.560 position:16% line:83% align:start
Let's make sure we score
over 30 goals!
