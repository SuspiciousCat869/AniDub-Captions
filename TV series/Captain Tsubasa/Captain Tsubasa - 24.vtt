If I get in,

00:00:59.694 --> 00:01:03.865 position:19% line:83% align:start
the Toho Academy would
cover all of my tuition.

00:01:03.898 --> 00:01:05.332 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's the reason why...

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:07.334 position:33% line:83% align:start
I want to win
this tournament.

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.403 position:24% line:89% align:start
But Toho Academy...

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:11.739 position:24% line:83% align:start

in Tsubasa.

00:01:11.773 --> 00:01:12.840 position:30% line:83% align:start

the penalty area.

what I did was wrong.

00:01:17.512 --> 00:01:20.682 position:27% line:83% align:start

I beg for your forgiveness.

Captain Hyuga...

00:01:23.051 --> 00:01:25.620 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll get one goal

00:01:25.653 --> 00:01:26.286 position:30% line:89% align:start
no matter what!

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:30.324 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's Meiwa's
real style of play!

00:01:30.357 --> 00:01:31.960 position:16% line:89% align:start
We'll win no matter what!
