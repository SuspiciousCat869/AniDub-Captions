 <i>an appearance</i>

00:00:09.644 --> 00:00:11.846 position:10% line:83% align:start

 <i>his ability</i>

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:17.519 position:19% line:83% align:start

 <i>move, The Falcon Shot,</i>

00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:20.087 position:16% line:83% align:start

 <i>tournament twice in a row,</i>

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.262 position:16% line:83% align:start

 <i>correct their behavior</i>

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:29.964 position:27% line:83% align:start
 <i>by being firm</i>
 <i>and decisive.</i>

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:27.589 position:21% line:83% align:start
[narr] <i>Team Nankatsu</i>
 <i>defeated Team Okabe</i>

00:01:27.622 --> 00:01:30.157 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>in the semifinals</i>
 <i>5 goals to 1.</i>

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:33.293 position:10% line:89% align:start
They're playing really well.

00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:36.163 position:10% line:83% align:start
They've gotten better since
we last played together.

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:37.464 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now that Tsubasa
plays in the midfield

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:40.068 position:10% line:83% align:start
and Izawa, Taki, and Kisugi
play on the offense...

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.036 position:24% line:83% align:start
Morisaki, Takasugi,
and Ishizaki

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.771 position:24% line:83% align:start
are playing calmly
on defense.

00:01:43.805 --> 00:01:44.906 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ha!

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.340 position:24% line:83% align:start
Even if they have
a good formation,

00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:49.476 position:13% line:83% align:start
in the end, the weight of
the team is in Tsubasa.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.846 position:27% line:83% align:start
It doesn't matter
if he plays here or there...

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:54.448 position:19% line:83% align:start
he's the one deciding
everything the team does.

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.483 position:38% line:83% align:start
And so,
if we immobilize him,

00:01:56.517 --> 00:01:58.352 position:19% line:83% align:start
they won't be able to
beat us.

00:01:58.385 --> 00:01:59.821 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Kojiro]
It's true that Tsubasa

00:01:59.854 --> 00:02:01.055 position:19% line:83% align:start
-is their key player.
-Huh?

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:02.389 position:41% line:89% align:start
But...

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:04.458 position:13% line:83% align:start
you're too na Ã¯ve to think
that stopping Tsubasa

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:06.193 position:27% line:83% align:start
is an easy task
to accomplish.

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:07.227 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Hanji]
You're...

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.495 position:30% line:89% align:start
Kojiro Hyuga.

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:10.330 position:16% line:83% align:start
You have to take my word
for it.

00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:12.366 position:19% line:83% align:start
After having lost and
placed second two times

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:13.801 position:10% line:89% align:start
in the national tournament,

00:02:13.835 --> 00:02:15.503 position:27% line:83% align:start
I know it's not
an easy task.

00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:19.073 position:16% line:83% align:start
But this time, it's all
gonna go differently.

00:02:19.107 --> 00:02:20.541 position:35% line:83% align:start
This year,
we're even stronger.

00:02:20.575 --> 00:02:21.375 position:27% line:89% align:start
On top of that,

00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:23.611 position:24% line:83% align:start
the coordination
in a team is key.

00:02:23.645 --> 00:02:26.080 position:16% line:83% align:start
In soccer, the only way
to obtain victory

00:02:26.114 --> 00:02:27.447 position:21% line:89% align:start
is through teamwork.

00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:28.281 position:33% line:89% align:start
You'll see.

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:29.851 position:35% line:83% align:start
We'll be
the uncontested champions

00:02:29.884 --> 00:02:31.251 position:10% line:89% align:start
of the national tournament.

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:32.352 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, maybe so.

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:34.354 position:19% line:83% align:start
But we'll be the ones
to defeat Nankatsu

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:36.858 position:21% line:83% align:start
and they won't get to
play against you guys.

00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:38.258 position:41% line:83% align:start
[laugh]
Oh, you're killing me.

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:39.661 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's a good joke, man.

00:02:39.694 --> 00:02:41.963 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've already seen
you guys play and...

00:02:41.996 --> 00:02:43.731 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll have you know
you have no chance

00:02:43.765 --> 00:02:44.532 position:24% line:89% align:start
against Nankatsu.

00:02:44.565 --> 00:02:46.266 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[gasp]
-What did you just say?

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.735 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Shun]
Hey there, Hyuga...

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:48.836 position:16% line:89% align:start
With your track record,

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.004 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't think you have
the right

00:02:50.038 --> 00:02:51.139 position:19% line:89% align:start
to say anything to us.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.272 position:24% line:89% align:start
And why wouldn't I?

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:53.975 position:16% line:89% align:start
Because your own team...

00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:55.409 position:24% line:83% align:start
hasn't won a single
tournament.

00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:57.377 position:13% line:89% align:start
Unlike a team lead by me.

00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:59.279 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was able to defeat
Team Meiwa...

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:02.116 position:24% line:83% align:start
when I used to play
for Nankatsu.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.851 position:19% line:89% align:start
My name is Shun Nitta.

00:03:03.885 --> 00:03:05.720 position:16% line:89% align:start
And don't you forget it.

00:03:05.753 --> 00:03:07.622 position:44% line:83% align:start

Today is the big finals.

I prepared for the team.

-Oh...

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.485 position:19% line:83% align:start
Uh, of course it isn't

It's really obvious, Sanae.

00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:23.090 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm sure Tsubasa
will fall in love with

00:05:23.124 --> 00:05:25.126 position:16% line:89% align:start
your honey lemon slices.

Your refreshment

Team, pay attention.

00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:02.296 position:13% line:83% align:start
Until now, we've defeated
teams easily.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.396 position:30% line:89% align:start
But Team Otomo

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.199 position:30% line:83% align:start
is a completely
different team now.

00:06:05.233 --> 00:06:07.034 position:13% line:83% align:start

Hey, Coach.

00:06:10.204 --> 00:06:11.939 position:44% line:83% align:start
Hm?
What's on your mind, kiddo?

00:06:11.973 --> 00:06:15.543 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm aware that...I have...
to respect my position.

00:06:15.576 --> 00:06:17.178 position:30% line:83% align:start
But allow me
to cover Nitta.

00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:19.146 position:19% line:83% align:start
You want to cover him
man to man?

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.815 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, Urabe and the rest...

00:06:20.848 --> 00:06:22.415 position:24% line:83% align:start
will be defending
their own goal.

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:24.085 position:21% line:83% align:start
And they plan to use
Shun Nitta

00:06:24.118 --> 00:06:25.553 position:10% line:89% align:start
to run their counterattacks.

00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:26.954 position:30% line:83% align:start
Their strategy
depends on Nitta

00:06:26.988 --> 00:06:29.557 position:19% line:83% align:start
managing to get close
to the danger zone.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.158 position:19% line:89% align:start
If I play like always,

00:06:31.192 --> 00:06:32.727 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nitta will be free
to attack.

00:06:33.661 --> 00:06:36.097 position:21% line:83% align:start
And that's precisely
what Team Otomo

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.965 position:21% line:89% align:start
wants us to do, sir.

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:40.601 position:33% line:83% align:start
I ask you...
let me cover him man to man.

00:06:41.502 --> 00:06:42.570 position:24% line:89% align:start
Then it's settled.

00:06:42.603 --> 00:06:45.039 position:10% line:83% align:start

you know
this muscular brute?

00:14:17.891 --> 00:14:19.860 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I'll introduce you.

00:14:19.893 --> 00:14:21.730 position:10% line:89% align:start
He's my cousin from Kyushu.

00:14:21.763 --> 00:14:23.063 position:13% line:89% align:start
His name is Hiroshi Jito.

00:14:23.097 --> 00:14:23.531 position:13% line:83% align:start
[narr] <i>We'll be right back</i>
 <i>with Captain Tsubasa.</i>

00:14:23.565 --> 00:14:24.632 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mhm.

00:14:24.666 --> 00:14:26.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey, you came to
spy on Nankatsu?

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.102 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Why are you really here?
-Mhm, mhm.

00:14:28.135 --> 00:14:30.137 position:27% line:83% align:start
All right, fine,
I'll explain myself.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.873 position:13% line:83% align:start
We came to see how strong
Nankatsu really is,

00:14:32.906 --> 00:14:34.408 position:27% line:83% align:start
but by the looks
of things...

00:14:34.441 --> 00:14:37.878 position:13% line:83% align:start
Team Otomo is outplaying
them in every single way.

00:14:37.911 --> 00:14:40.548 position:16% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa couldn't handle
their quartet.

00:14:40.582 --> 00:14:43.250 position:24% line:83% align:start
And the shot that
looked to be a sure goal...

00:14:43.283 --> 00:14:45.620 position:27% line:83% align:start
was stopped by
Otomo's goalie.

00:14:45.653 --> 00:14:47.121 position:33% line:83% align:start
And I haven't
even mentioned

00:14:47.154 --> 00:14:50.023 position:35% line:83% align:start
number 9's
incredible ability.

00:14:50.057 --> 00:14:53.628 position:16% line:83% align:start
Maybe I'm exaggerating,
but he's very strong.

00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:54.662 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Katagiri]
You're very right.

00:14:54.696 --> 00:14:55.730 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:55.764 --> 00:14:57.898 position:24% line:83% align:start
Even if he did lose
against Tsubasa,

00:14:57.931 --> 00:15:01.468 position:19% line:83% align:start
he can keep up his pace
with no problem, you know?

00:15:01.503 --> 00:15:03.605 position:21% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa already knew
how strong he was.

00:15:03.638 --> 00:15:04.672 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's why he preferred...

00:15:04.706 --> 00:15:06.674 position:27% line:83% align:start
to be on defense
so he could cover him.

00:15:06.708 --> 00:15:08.475 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Hiroshi]
Hey, and who might you be?

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.345 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm from the Japanese
Soccer Federation.

00:15:11.378 --> 00:15:12.680 position:24% line:89% align:start
Munemasa Katagiri.

00:15:13.447 --> 00:15:15.015 position:16% line:89% align:start
And you're Hiroshi Jito.

00:15:15.583 --> 00:15:16.684 position:30% line:89% align:start
From Nagasaki.

00:15:16.718 --> 00:15:17.819 position:27% line:83% align:start
And you play for
Team Hirado,

00:15:17.852 --> 00:15:18.787 position:24% line:89% align:start
isn't that right?

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:19.821 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:15:19.854 --> 00:15:21.054 position:24% line:83% align:start
The two teams are
dedicating

00:15:21.088 --> 00:15:23.056 position:13% line:83% align:start
almost all their attention
into defending.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.292 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's why it's becoming
hard to attack.

00:15:25.325 --> 00:15:26.927 position:13% line:83% align:start
That means whoever scores
the first goal

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.897 position:19% line:83% align:start
will surely take home
the win.

00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:31.098 position:19% line:83% align:start
By how strong Otomo's
goalkeeper is,

00:15:31.131 --> 00:15:33.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
the only way I see
Nankatsu winning

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.235 position:33% line:83% align:start
is if Tsubasa
shoots to the goal.

00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:37.539 position:38% line:83% align:start
However,
Nitta would be free.

00:15:37.572 --> 00:15:38.573 position:13% line:89% align:start
And he'd be a big threat.

00:15:39.273 --> 00:15:40.809 position:10% line:89% align:start
If that were ever to happen,

00:15:40.842 --> 00:15:42.376 position:27% line:83% align:start
Otomo would be in
a better situation

00:15:42.409 --> 00:15:44.311 position:24% line:83% align:start
with their offense
and defense.

00:15:44.344 --> 00:15:45.680 position:24% line:83% align:start
They'd have too big
an advantage.

00:15:45.713 --> 00:15:46.915 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:15:46.947 --> 00:15:48.348 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Katagiri]
That's why...

00:15:48.382 --> 00:15:51.218 position:13% line:83% align:start
we could basically say that
this match is a duel between

00:15:51.251 --> 00:15:53.655 position:30% line:83% align:start
Shun Nitta and
Tsubasa Ozora.

00:15:53.688 --> 00:15:54.856 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh!

Perfect.

00:16:47.909 --> 00:16:50.377 position:27% line:83% align:start
You were able to
deviate my shot.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:52.881 position:19% line:83% align:start
You knew it was going
straight for your face.

00:16:52.914 --> 00:16:55.382 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you would've dodged it
completely...

00:16:55.415 --> 00:16:57.552 position:16% line:83% align:start
that shot would've been
a goal...

00:16:57.585 --> 00:16:59.854 position:30% line:83% align:start

you wanted to grace it

[Katagiri]
That's correct.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.584 position:10% line:83% align:start
Japan is too small a country
for Tsubasa already.

00:17:29.617 --> 00:17:32.185 position:19% line:83% align:start
In fact, I don't think
there's anybody here

00:17:32.219 --> 00:17:35.155 position:21% line:83% align:start
that can possibly go
toe to toe with him.

Kojiro Hyuga from
Toho Accademy,

00:17:37.825 --> 00:17:40.360 position:30% line:83% align:start
and his goalie
Ken Wakashimazu...

00:17:40.394 --> 00:17:42.396 position:13% line:89% align:start
Jun Misugi from Musashi...

00:17:43.063 --> 00:17:44.732 position:16% line:89% align:start
Matsuyama from Furano...

00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:48.570 position:16% line:83% align:start
and the Tachibana twins
from Hanawa.

00:17:48.603 --> 00:17:52.774 position:10% line:83% align:start
All of them were his rivals
during his younger years.

00:17:52.807 --> 00:17:53.908 position:10% line:89% align:start
However, the last two years

00:17:53.942 --> 00:17:55.309 position:24% line:83% align:start
he's been playing
in high school.

00:17:55.342 --> 00:17:57.679 position:13% line:83% align:start
None of them have managed
to achieve the level

00:17:57.712 --> 00:17:59.981 position:16% line:89% align:start
that Tsubasa holds now.

00:18:00.014 --> 00:18:01.649 position:10% line:89% align:start
Instead of making me happy,

00:18:01.683 --> 00:18:03.051 position:13% line:89% align:start
it worries me that Tsubasa

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:05.485 position:19% line:83% align:start
can't keep developing
his talents.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.321 position:19% line:83% align:start
But now that he's met
Shun Nitta,

00:18:07.354 --> 00:18:09.057 position:33% line:83% align:start
he's regained
that sensation

00:18:09.089 --> 00:18:11.091 position:21% line:83% align:start
of feeling pressured
by his opponent.

00:18:11.124 --> 00:18:12.392 position:13% line:89% align:start
He's gained the motivation

00:18:12.426 --> 00:18:14.261 position:24% line:83% align:start
to give it his all
on the field.

00:18:14.294 --> 00:18:16.263 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's a huge relief.

00:18:16.296 --> 00:18:19.534 position:24% line:83% align:start
What Tsubasa needed
was exactly this.

00:18:19.567 --> 00:18:21.636 position:24% line:83% align:start
A worthy opponent
to battle with.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.272 position:19% line:83% align:start
And to be quite frank,
my dear friend...

00:18:25.305 --> 00:18:26.373 position:24% line:89% align:start
I know that you too

00:18:26.406 --> 00:18:27.942 position:24% line:83% align:start
could also become
a worthy opponent

00:18:27.976 --> 00:18:29.744 position:16% line:89% align:start
for Nankatsu's captain.

00:18:29.777 --> 00:18:31.111 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's obvious, sir.

00:18:31.144 --> 00:18:33.681 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't you worry,
I'll have him trembling.
