00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.974 position:47% line:83% align:start
No.
We can't do that.

00:03:49.063 --> 00:03:50.230 position:27% line:83% align:start

Uhh...

00:03:55.503 --> 00:03:57.605 position:24% line:83% align:start
That new technique
was excellent.

00:03:57.638 --> 00:03:59.707 position:16% line:83% align:start
And it seems like there's
no way to counter it

00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:00.842 position:33% line:89% align:start
and stop it.

00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:03.778 position:13% line:83% align:start

to be a very big problem.

to stop that shot.

00:04:06.313 --> 00:04:08.149 position:13% line:89% align:start

00:04:09.584 --> 00:04:09.751 position:33% line:89% align:start

 <i>Hyuga...</i>

So, "Skylab Hurricane", huh?

00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:26.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
Listen, were you able to
capture that?

00:04:26.868 --> 00:04:29.103 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah. It's been a while
since I'd seen

00:04:29.137 --> 00:04:30.938 position:19% line:83% align:start
such an incredible shot
live.

00:04:30.972 --> 00:04:32.039 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, stop me if I'm wrong,

00:04:32.073 --> 00:04:33.306 position:27% line:83% align:start
but if I remember
correctly...

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.275 position:27% line:83% align:start
the Triangle Shot
is performed

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:37.145 position:21% line:83% align:start
by using a corner of
the goalpost to jump

00:04:37.178 --> 00:04:38.513 position:19% line:89% align:start
and complete the shot.

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:41.816 position:35% line:83% align:start
That forms
a perfect triangle.

00:04:43.718 --> 00:04:46.187 position:21% line:83% align:start
However, the "Skylab
Hurricane" technique

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.688 position:27% line:83% align:start
allows the person
that's jumping

00:04:47.722 --> 00:04:49.223 position:24% line:83% align:start
to connect directly
with the shot,

00:04:49.257 --> 00:04:51.793 position:21% line:83% align:start
without depending on
the goalpost for impulse.

00:04:51.826 --> 00:04:55.830 position:16% line:83% align:start
Whoever is on the ground
becomes a human trampoline.

00:04:55.863 --> 00:04:57.565 position:16% line:89% align:start
This match is incredible.

00:04:57.598 --> 00:05:00.535 position:33% line:83% align:start
Team Nankatsu
is in serious problems.

00:05:00.568 --> 00:05:02.970 position:21% line:83% align:start
What's you next move
going to be, Tsubasa?

00:05:04.172 --> 00:05:06.274 position:38% line:83% align:start
Nankatsu,
I want you to remain calm.

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:07.275 position:33% line:89% align:start
Remain calm?

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:08.743 position:21% line:83% align:start
How do you expect me
to calm down

00:05:08.776 --> 00:05:10.611 position:33% line:83% align:start
after seeing
that incredible shot?

00:05:10.645 --> 00:05:12.445 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's impressive, no doubt...

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:13.848 position:19% line:89% align:start
but it's not foolproof.

00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:16.349 position:13% line:83% align:start
They depend on an elevated
pass to complete it.

00:05:16.383 --> 00:05:17.118 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Oh!
-Oh!

00:05:17.151 --> 00:05:18.586 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's true, guys.

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:19.821 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, since that's
the case...

00:05:19.854 --> 00:05:21.421 position:19% line:83% align:start
we should put pressure
on the player

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:22.623 position:16% line:89% align:start
making the elevated pass

00:05:22.657 --> 00:05:24.258 position:19% line:83% align:start
so he's unable to pass
to the twins.

00:05:24.292 --> 00:05:25.693 position:21% line:89% align:start
Of course, I get it.

00:05:25.726 --> 00:05:27.895 position:16% line:83% align:start
Instead of just defending
their shots...

00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:28.729 position:21% line:89% align:start
we'll keep attacking.

00:05:28.763 --> 00:05:31.032 position:16% line:83% align:start
That way they won't have
that chance.

00:05:31.065 --> 00:05:31.899 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mhm.

00:05:31.933 --> 00:05:32.700 position:27% line:89% align:start
