[narrator] City of Nankatsu,
 <i>Shizuoka Prefecture.</i>

00:00:09.978 --> 00:00:11.111 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, guys, look at this.

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:12.514 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's an article
about Tsubasa.

00:00:12.547 --> 00:00:14.549 position:30% line:83% align:start
"Tsubasa Ozora
surprises everybody

00:00:14.582 --> 00:00:15.449 position:19% line:89% align:start
"with his Drive Shot.

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:16.951 position:10% line:83% align:start
Team Nankatsu is very close
to winning

00:00:16.985 --> 00:00:18.385 position:13% line:89% align:start
"their tri-championship."

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:19.988 position:24% line:83% align:start
Finally, we'll see
the match between

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.724 position:16% line:83% align:start
Nankatsu against Furano
and Toho against Meiwa.

00:00:22.757 --> 00:00:23.992 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think the finals
will be Nankatsu

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.392 position:19% line:89% align:start
against Toho Academy.

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:26.728 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Hanji]
I wouldn't be so sure

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:27.595 position:33% line:83% align:start
-about that.
-Huh?

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:28.495 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Takeshi]
Hello, Urabe.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.831 position:24% line:83% align:start
Furano will have to
go up against

00:00:29.864 --> 00:00:31.398 position:19% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa's Drive Shot.

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:33.868 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's very clear that
Nankatsu's heavily relied on

00:00:33.902 --> 00:00:35.503 position:10% line:89% align:start
their current style of play.

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.006 position:10% line:89% align:start
And about the other match...

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.507 position:10% line:89% align:start
Team Meiwa has eight players

00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:41.275 position:16% line:83% align:start
from their original team
in elementary.

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:42.644 position:10% line:89% align:start
All of them know inside out

00:00:42.677 --> 00:00:45.379 position:24% line:83% align:start
how Toho Academy's
trident power house plays.

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:48.115 position:16% line:83% align:start
Of course, and they were
also trained by Mister Kira.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:49.517 position:10% line:89% align:start
The players from Team Meiwa

00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:51.285 position:24% line:83% align:start
know Kojiro Hyuga's
style of play

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:52.587 position:27% line:83% align:start
like the back of
their hands.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.254 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's very likely...

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:55.857 position:24% line:83% align:start
that they'll give
Team Toho Academy

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.158 position:33% line:83% align:start
a tough time
in the semifinals match.

00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:01.729 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's just like when
we played against Nankatsu.

00:01:01.763 --> 00:01:03.665 position:19% line:83% align:start
And you also shouldn't
forget...

00:01:03.698 --> 00:01:06.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hyuga hasn't even played
in the tournament yet.

00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:08.402 position:24% line:89% align:start
We can't predict...

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:10.304 position:10% line:89% align:start
who will be today's winner.

Hyuga...

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:46.060 position:30% line:83% align:start
He won't play

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:06.114 position:24% line:83% align:start

Wakashimazu used to be
a forward before.

00:20:30.297 --> 00:20:31.933 position:24% line:83% align:start
But Hyuga asked him
to be a goalie.

00:20:32.834 --> 00:20:34.702 position:13% line:83% align:start
And Coach Kira taught him
everything.

00:20:34.736 --> 00:20:35.670 position:19% line:89% align:start
He polished his skills

00:20:35.703 --> 00:20:37.839 position:21% line:83% align:start

the player he is now.

Whether it's on the attack

00:20:43.044 --> 00:20:45.113 position:19% line:83% align:start
there's no doubt that
Ken Wakashimazu
