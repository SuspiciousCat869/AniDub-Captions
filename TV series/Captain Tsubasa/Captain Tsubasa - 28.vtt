Misaki!

00:12:22.677 --> 00:12:23.811 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why're you carrying
your luggage?

00:12:23.844 --> 00:12:25.212 position:21% line:83% align:start
You were supposed to
leave tomorrow.

00:12:25.246 --> 00:12:26.247 position:21% line:89% align:start
Why'd you lie to us?

00:12:26.747 --> 00:12:28.048 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:12:28.082 --> 00:12:30.117 position:13% line:83% align:start
I thought it'd be too hard
to say goodbye to you guys

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.785 position:27% line:83% align:start
after everything
we've been through.

00:12:31.819 --> 00:12:34.054 position:24% line:83% align:start
That would've been
messed up, Misaki!

00:12:34.088 --> 00:12:34.522 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:12:35.657 --> 00:12:37.726 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ryo, we can't keep
waiting any longer.

00:12:37.758 --> 00:12:38.959 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I know we can't.

00:12:38.993 --> 00:12:41.262 position:27% line:83% align:start
Misaki, what time
is your bus leaving?

00:12:41.295 --> 00:12:42.029 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:12:42.062 --> 00:12:44.131 position:24% line:83% align:start
Like in 15 minutes
I suppose.

00:12:44.164 --> 00:12:45.899 position:35% line:83% align:start
Okay then,
I'm going to have to

00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:48.503 position:35% line:83% align:start
run over to
Tsubasa's house real fast.

00:12:48.536 --> 00:12:50.471 position:30% line:83% align:start
And meanwhile,
we'll go get Genzo.

00:12:50.505 --> 00:12:51.472 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

[Ryo] What?
He's not here?!

00:12:57.579 --> 00:12:58.879 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah, he got out of
the house early.

00:12:58.912 --> 00:13:00.881 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think he was headed
towards the river.

00:13:00.914 --> 00:13:01.882 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is something wrong?

00:13:01.915 --> 00:13:02.916 position:24% line:89% align:start

What're you talking about?

00:15:39.106 --> 00:15:40.842 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, it's just that...

00:15:40.875 --> 00:15:42.443 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm going to play
in Germany.

Genzo...

00:15:46.514 --> 00:15:49.383 position:27% line:83% align:start
Next school year,
you'll be in middle school.

00:15:49.416 --> 00:15:50.150 position:38% line:89% align:start
I know...

00:15:51.084 --> 00:15:53.655 position:24% line:83% align:start
I have to tell you
something important.

00:15:53.688 --> 00:15:56.558 position:13% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately, I can't keep
being your trainer here.

00:15:56.591 --> 00:15:58.392 position:24% line:83% align:start
-I'm deeply sorry.
-What?!

00:15:58.425 --> 00:16:00.562 position:24% line:83% align:start
The Japanese soccer
association

00:16:00.595 --> 00:16:03.631 position:19% line:83% align:start
has requested for me to
attend a special seminar

00:16:03.665 --> 00:16:05.733 position:35% line:83% align:start
of trainers
hosted in Germany.

00:16:05.767 --> 00:16:06.901 position:35% line:83% align:start
The reason
they're doing this

00:16:06.935 --> 00:16:09.303 position:24% line:83% align:start
is so we can better
the level of the players

00:16:09.336 --> 00:16:10.270 position:30% line:89% align:start
here in Japan.

00:16:10.304 --> 00:16:13.073 position:41% line:83% align:start
And...
when are you leaving?

00:16:13.106 --> 00:16:15.375 position:30% line:83% align:start
I have to leave
in the beginning of spring.

00:16:15.409 --> 00:16:17.411 position:21% line:83% align:start
And I'll be spending
two whole years there

00:16:17.444 --> 00:16:19.213 position:24% line:83% align:start
learning everything
about the style of play

00:16:19.246 --> 00:16:21.048 position:27% line:83% align:start
they're teaching
in Europe nowadays.

00:16:21.916 --> 00:16:23.718 position:30% line:83% align:start
But I wanted to
ask you this...

00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:24.819 position:30% line:89% align:start
Genzo, tell me,

00:16:24.853 --> 00:16:27.454 position:27% line:83% align:start
would you like to
come to Germany with me?

00:16:27.488 --> 00:16:28.489 position:27% line:89% align:start
Are you serious?

00:16:29.624 --> 00:16:30.792 position:41% line:83% align:start
-[gasp]
-No...

00:16:30.825 --> 00:16:33.260 position:19% line:83% align:start
So then you're leaving
to Germany now?

00:16:33.293 --> 00:16:36.063 position:13% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa, when I heard that
you were going to Brazil,

00:16:36.096 --> 00:16:37.732 position:24% line:83% align:start
I started to think
a lot about

00:16:37.765 --> 00:16:38.633 position:19% line:89% align:start
my professional career.

00:16:39.567 --> 00:16:41.703 position:30% line:83% align:start
If I want to be
a professional player,

00:16:41.736 --> 00:16:45.072 position:7% line:83% align:start
I have to learn to play soccer
at the world level.

00:16:45.105 --> 00:16:46.774 position:27% line:83% align:start
The soccer league
in Germany

00:16:46.808 --> 00:16:48.910 position:24% line:83% align:start
is one of the best
in the world.

00:16:48.943 --> 00:16:52.112 position:19% line:83% align:start
And they have the best
goalies to ever live.

00:16:52.145 --> 00:16:54.214 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's the main reason
I want to go.

00:16:55.249 --> 00:16:58.318 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wish to be the best
goalkeeper in the world.

00:16:58.352 --> 00:16:59.419 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Wakabayashi...
-But Captain,

00:16:59.453 --> 00:17:00.454 position:27% line:89% align:start
it's just that--

00:17:03.056 --> 00:17:04.759 position:21% line:89% align:start
Genzo, I wish you...

00:17:04.792 --> 00:17:06.126 position:27% line:89% align:start
the best of luck.

00:17:06.159 --> 00:17:08.997 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm sure nothing will get
on the way of your dreams.

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:10.798 position:35% line:83% align:start
Thank you.
I'll do my best.

00:17:10.832 --> 00:17:11.666 position:21% line:89% align:start
But before I leave...

00:17:12.499 --> 00:17:15.035 position:19% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa, I'm asking you
to please

00:17:15.068 --> 00:17:17.204 position:16% line:83% align:start
let me have one last duel
against you.

00:17:17.237 --> 00:17:18.038 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mhm.

00:17:18.071 --> 00:17:20.842 position:30% line:83% align:start

ask the same of you.

You know that we've been

right?

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:17.652 position:19% line:83% align:start
We only had three days
of rest

00:20:17.685 --> 00:20:20.788 position:21% line:83% align:start
and that's not nearly

Well, now that Tsubasa
is playing with us,

00:20:24.491 --> 00:20:25.860 position:16% line:83% align:start
it's rare to lose a game
