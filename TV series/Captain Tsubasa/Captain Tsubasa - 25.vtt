You're back, Misaki!

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:37.605 position:21% line:83% align:start
Calm down, Tsubasa.
I know what I have to do.

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:38.305 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:40.107 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll go get the ball
for you,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.275 position:24% line:89% align:start
I promise you that!

Are you really sure
about this coach?

00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:54.388 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're forgetting that

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.423 position:13% line:83% align:start
this is Taro's last match
with us.

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:58.425 position:21% line:83% align:start
He'll have to change
schools after.

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:00.028 position:24% line:83% align:start
We can't deny him
this chance.

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:07.001 position:16% line:89% align:start
Despite his leg injury,

00:01:07.035 --> 00:01:09.737 position:19% line:83% align:start
he doesn't want to be
a burden to his team.

00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:10.805 position:21% line:89% align:start
He's set his mind on

00:01:10.838 --> 00:01:12.540 position:24% line:83% align:start
leaving everything
on the pitch.

00:01:12.574 --> 00:01:15.075 position:13% line:83% align:start
Cheer up, we have to pass
the ball to the captain

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:16.778 position:16% line:83% align:start

00:10:59.026 --> 00:11:02.229 position:10% line:83% align:start

 <i>What's worse is that,</i>

 <i>in spite of</i>
 <i>Nankatsu's attempts,</i>

 <i>Meiwa has had more</i>

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.115 position:21% line:89% align:start
 <i>In their last shot,</i>

-[Tsubasa] Good shot, Hyuga.

00:11:38.667 --> 00:11:40.000 position:27% line:83% align:start
-What'd you say?
-Huh?

00:11:40.034 --> 00:11:41.636 position:30% line:83% align:start
But the match
isn't over yet.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.103 position:21% line:89% align:start
Don't get too cocky.

00:11:45.272 --> 00:11:46.273 position:35% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa...

00:11:46.675 --> 00:11:47.741 position:33% line:89% align:start
He's right.

00:11:47.775 --> 00:11:49.644 position:24% line:83% align:start
We got all the time
to tie the match.

00:11:49.678 --> 00:11:50.612 position:24% line:89% align:start
Just wait and see.

00:11:50.645 --> 00:11:52.213 position:16% line:83% align:start
We'll score another goal

00:11:52.246 --> 00:11:53.113 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:11:53.147 --> 00:11:54.014 position:27% line:89% align:start
Listen up, guys,

00:11:54.048 --> 00:11:55.550 position:24% line:83% align:start
We've been through
way tougher times

00:11:55.584 --> 00:11:57.751 position:10% line:83% align:start
and we've come out winning,
always.

00:11:57.785 --> 00:12:00.087 position:33% line:83% align:start
Don't think
you won the match, Meiwa.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:00.721 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, guys.

00:12:01.523 --> 00:12:03.090 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[Yuzo] Wakabayashi...
-Huh?

00:12:03.123 --> 00:12:04.693 position:21% line:83% align:start
Here, you should use
my gloves.

00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:06.760 position:10% line:83% align:start
Thank you so much for these,
Morisaki.

00:12:06.794 --> 00:12:08.896 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've been wondering...
Your leg...

00:12:08.929 --> 00:12:10.431 position:38% line:83% align:start
Tell me,
are you injured again?

00:12:10.464 --> 00:12:11.666 position:24% line:89% align:start
Do you feel pain?

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.301 position:33% line:83% align:start
Don't worry,
I feel perfectly fine.

00:12:14.335 --> 00:12:15.503 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is really nothing

00:12:15.537 --> 00:12:17.505 position:24% line:83% align:start
but a small setback
in the match.

00:12:17.539 --> 00:12:19.039 position:33% line:83% align:start
There's still
four minutes left.

00:12:19.073 --> 00:12:21.041 position:24% line:83% align:start
I know we can still
win this.

00:12:21.075 --> 00:12:21.909 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's true.

00:12:21.942 --> 00:12:23.844 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's just like Tsubasa
said earlier,

00:12:23.877 --> 00:12:25.846 position:21% line:83% align:start
the match isn't over
just yet.

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:27.481 position:33% line:83% align:start
I know we can
come out on top.

00:12:28.816 --> 00:12:31.986 position:10% line:83% align:start
You really have a great team
behind you, Tsubasa.

00:12:32.019 --> 00:12:32.953 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mhm.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.656 position:27% line:89% align:start
Listen up, guys.

00:12:34.689 --> 00:12:36.056 position:24% line:89% align:start
And pay attention.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:37.791 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nankatsu will come
and counterattack.

00:12:37.825 --> 00:12:39.193 position:24% line:89% align:start
We have to defend.

00:12:39.226 --> 00:12:40.261 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

00:12:40.294 --> 00:12:42.296 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>You won't take it</i>
 <i>away from me.</i>

00:12:42.329 --> 00:12:43.397 position:24% line:89% align:start
 <i>Victory is mine.</i>

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.265 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>I put my pride behind</i>

00:12:44.298 --> 00:12:45.933 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>to be able to score</i>
 <i>that goal.</i>

00:12:46.967 --> 00:12:49.236 position:30% line:83% align:start
That last goal
was a demonstration

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.039 position:21% line:83% align:start
that Kojiro Hyuga has
matured since last time.

00:12:52.072 --> 00:12:53.073 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

00:12:53.107 --> 00:12:55.744 position:19% line:83% align:start
Until today, Hyuga had
only used his strength

00:12:55.776 --> 00:12:58.178 position:16% line:83% align:start
to make his way through
everyone on the pitch.

00:12:58.212 --> 00:12:59.079 position:30% line:89% align:start
But this time,

00:12:59.113 --> 00:13:00.814 position:19% line:83% align:start
he decided to do away
with his pride

00:13:00.848 --> 00:13:02.617 position:24% line:83% align:start
and maneuver to try
and score the goal,

00:13:02.651 --> 00:13:05.286 position:24% line:83% align:start
which gave his team
the advantage.

00:13:05.319 --> 00:13:06.253 position:24% line:89% align:start
 <i>I'm wondering...</i>

 <i>from this.</i>

We're so sorry, Coach.

00:19:22.563 --> 00:19:24.098 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you gave it your all

Soccer is like that.
It's unpredictable.

00:19:32.406 --> 00:19:33.473 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's why we have to

take advantage of the lead
we have.

00:19:35.242 --> 00:19:36.410 position:30% line:89% align:start

00:19:36.443 --> 00:19:38.813 position:16% line:83% align:start
I want you to play with
the same determination

00:19:38.846 --> 00:19:40.213 position:19% line:89% align:start

[Roberto] Before,
when I'd get injured,

00:20:32.432 --> 00:20:34.135 position:16% line:83% align:start
my manager would give me
this massage

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:38.740 position:13% line:83% align:start
By the way, that last shot
you just made...

00:20:38.773 --> 00:20:39.674 position:24% line:89% align:start
left me awestruck.

00:20:39.707 --> 00:20:41.374 position:19% line:83% align:start
It was just a reflex,
wasn't it?

Mhm.

00:20:43.077 --> 00:20:44.411 position:19% line:83% align:start
The good thing is that
your injury

00:20:44.444 --> 00:20:46.814 position:24% line:83% align:start
isn't as serious
as everyone's else's.

And don't forget...

00:20:48.049 --> 00:20:49.316 position:13% line:89% align:start
that now you have to win.

00:20:49.349 --> 00:20:51.418 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm sure we're going to win,
Roberto.

00:20:51.451 --> 00:20:53.521 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm feeling very motivated.

00:20:53.554 --> 00:20:55.255 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna go with you
to Brazil.

00:20:56.824 --> 00:20:57.859 position:16% line:89% align:start
Okay, follow it through.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.162 position:13% line:83% align:start
For now, just concentrate
