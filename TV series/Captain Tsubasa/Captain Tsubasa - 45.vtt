00:14:47.888 --> 00:14:49.223 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, hello, Mom...

00:14:49.256 --> 00:14:51.626 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm really sorry,
sweetheart.

00:14:51.659 --> 00:14:52.827 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mhm.

-[Ryo] Hey, Matsuyama!
-Huh?

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.405 position:19% line:89% align:start
It fell off your head.

00:15:04.438 --> 00:15:06.373 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ah! Is that so?

00:15:06.407 --> 00:15:07.374 position:41% line:89% align:start
Thanks.

00:15:07.408 --> 00:15:08.976 position:24% line:83% align:start
Listen, you have to
win the finals

00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:10.545 position:24% line:89% align:start
for our sake, okay?

00:15:10.578 --> 00:15:11.646 position:33% line:89% align:start
We sure will.

00:15:11.679 --> 00:15:12.881 position:38% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:15:12.913 --> 00:15:14.948 position:24% line:89% align:start

00:15:14.982 --> 00:15:17.619 position:13% line:83% align:start
the finals will be between
Nankatsu and Toho Academy.

00:15:17.652 --> 00:15:18.653 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:15:19.953 --> 00:15:21.656 position:21% line:89% align:start
I can't wait anymore.

00:15:21.689 --> 00:15:23.758 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm anxious to see Genzo

00:15:31.699 --> 00:15:32.433 position:41% line:89% align:start
Coach.

00:15:32.466 --> 00:15:33.768 position:44% line:83% align:start
Uh...
Of course.

00:15:33.802 --> 00:15:34.903 position:13% line:89% align:start
The first thing I tell you,

00:15:34.935 --> 00:15:36.937 position:30% line:83% align:start
and here you go
and do the opposite, kid.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.038 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm really sorry.

00:15:38.071 --> 00:15:39.707 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's just that I didn't
want the match

00:15:39.741 --> 00:15:41.275 position:13% line:89% align:start
to go to penalties, doctor.

00:15:41.308 --> 00:15:43.545 position:30% line:83% align:start
I wanted to win
fair and square.

00:15:43.578 --> 00:15:44.478 position:35% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa...

00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:47.448 position:33% line:83% align:start
And I really
owe it all to you.

00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:49.983 position:24% line:83% align:start
Had I not had this
alongside me, doctor...

00:15:50.017 --> 00:15:51.553 position:30% line:83% align:start
I would've lost
my motivation.

00:15:52.687 --> 00:15:54.522 position:27% line:83% align:start

on his shoulder?

00:15:54.556 --> 00:15:55.155 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:15:55.857 --> 00:15:56.925 position:30% line:89% align:start
isn't the best,

00:15:56.957 --> 00:15:58.492 position:21% line:83% align:start

writing it there.

I understand.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:51.039 position:30% line:83% align:start
So then Yoshiko
already left?

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:54.008 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah. She asked me
to say goodbye.

00:17:54.042 --> 00:17:55.577 position:33% line:83% align:start
If we had won
the semifinals,

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:58.046 position:24% line:83% align:start
she would've stayed
in Japan a day longer.

00:17:58.078 --> 00:18:00.715 position:21% line:83% align:start
So then, the captain
went chasing after her?

00:18:00.748 --> 00:18:02.249 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I highly doubt that...

00:18:02.282 --> 00:18:04.117 position:16% line:83% align:start
he caught up to the taxi
on foot.

00:18:04.919 --> 00:18:05.887 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's a shame.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.989 position:21% line:83% align:start
The truth is Yoshiko
has always

00:18:08.022 --> 00:18:09.389 position:33% line:83% align:start
been in love
with the captain.

00:18:09.423 --> 00:18:10.324 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Kiyoshi]
We know that.

00:18:10.357 --> 00:18:11.325 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:11.358 --> 00:18:13.027 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's been a long time
since we first thought

00:18:13.061 --> 00:18:14.796 position:27% line:83% align:start
she had the hots
for the captain.

00:18:14.829 --> 00:18:16.931 position:38% line:83% align:start
Actually,
she was really obvious.

00:18:16.965 --> 00:18:18.198 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Haruo]
That she was.

00:18:18.231 --> 00:18:20.300 position:27% line:83% align:start
But the captain's
as blind as a bat.

00:18:21.268 --> 00:18:22.737 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Kazumasa]
Being that case,

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:25.506 position:13% line:83% align:start
why did the captain decide
to chase after Yoshiko?

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:26.941 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Haruo]
Do you think he noticed?

00:18:26.975 --> 00:18:28.042 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Hisashi] Hopefully,
it's not too late

00:18:28.076 --> 00:18:29.476 position:27% line:89% align:start

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.079 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Machiko] Yoshiko never had
the courage

00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:32.513 position:21% line:89% align:start
to tell him herself.

00:18:37.986 --> 00:18:39.152 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:18:39.787 --> 00:18:40.755 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:46.794 --> 00:18:48.161 position:19% line:89% align:start
I was waiting for you.

00:18:48.195 --> 00:18:49.396 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hello, Captain.

00:18:50.999 --> 00:18:52.232 position:41% line:89% align:start
[pant]

00:18:56.436 --> 00:18:58.673 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's a good thing
I was able to catch up.

00:18:58.706 --> 00:19:00.240 position:27% line:89% align:start
But how and why?

00:19:00.273 --> 00:19:02.275 position:24% line:83% align:start
Someone brought me
to the airport.

00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:04.244 position:35% line:83% align:start
He was from
the soccer federation.

00:19:05.278 --> 00:19:07.381 position:38% line:83% align:start
In fact,
he drove so fast that...

00:19:08.215 --> 00:19:09.416 position:13% line:89% align:start
I think we passed the taxi

00:19:09.449 --> 00:19:11.919 position:21% line:83% align:start
your mom and you were
taking on the way here.

00:19:11.953 --> 00:19:14.154 position:21% line:83% align:start
Captain, your leg is
bleeding a lot.

00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:19.192 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Hikaru] Uhh...
Don't worry, it's nothing.

00:19:19.226 --> 00:19:20.327 position:35% line:83% align:start
Don't dirty
your handkerchief.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.630 position:27% line:83% align:start
But, I can't just
leave you like this.

00:19:23.665 --> 00:19:26.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
You always took care
of my injuries, Yoshiko.

00:19:26.768 --> 00:19:28.201 position:21% line:89% align:start
This is the last one.

00:19:28.235 --> 00:19:29.436 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're very impulsive

00:19:29.469 --> 00:19:30.805 position:27% line:83% align:start
and that gets you
hurt a lot.

00:19:30.838 --> 00:19:31.639 position:21% line:89% align:start
Believe me when I say

00:19:31.673 --> 00:19:32.940 position:21% line:83% align:start
that's the one thing
I won't miss.

00:19:32.974 --> 00:19:34.207 position:41% line:89% align:start
[laugh]

00:19:34.241 --> 00:19:37.045 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, it's the result of
my commitment to the team.

00:19:37.078 --> 00:19:38.079 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, I know that.

00:19:38.112 --> 00:19:39.847 position:13% line:83% align:start

It's nothing, Captain.

It's just I thought.

In fact, I kept screaming
while I chased your taxi,

00:19:56.064 --> 00:19:57.799 position:35% line:83% align:start
but I think
you never noticed me

00:19:57.832 --> 00:19:58.766 position:24% line:89% align:start
running behind it.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.201 position:16% line:83% align:start

Don't apologize.

00:20:06.841 --> 00:20:08.776 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm really sorry
I dirtied your handkerchief.

You won't be able to wipe

Mhm.

And don't forget to
write to me.

I'll be anxiously

Where could the captain be?

00:20:46.379 --> 00:20:48.916 position:10% line:83% align:start
Do you think he followed her
to the airport?

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:50.084 position:16% line:89% align:start
To be honest, I doubt it.

00:20:50.118 --> 00:20:51.753 position:16% line:89% align:start
He didn't have any money.

You have a call
waiting for you, Coach.

00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:55.288 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's from Hikaru Matsuyama.

Huh? Thank you very much,

Hello there, Coach.

I'm on my way back
from the Narita Airport.

Narita?

Please don't worry about me.

I'll be there soon.
